i'm gonna start our prediction well and
i'll get to six wins or more we're still
gonna play on the pay to win
beavers kind of have diminishing returns
but
i mean
that's pretty sick on it i mean i think
you freeze two of those sons of guns
i'll be the
the slippery bamboos if you know what i
mean
two one two one four two
it's a draw
it's called math sweetie
we don't invest on this turn
although what we could do is freeze
roll
what's done is done
combine
we should have combined the fish instead
because we get a value although we're
not going to sell these
so fuse one
there you go
we accept this
trade trade win
i think i think we win this one
i'm i'm betting the farm we win this one
that that beaver's too strong man
all right we draw
it's all right we we got scaling
yes we do we got scaling how about you
might as well start right i'm like maybe
you freeze this son of a gun no i don't
think so an owl it's a great sellable
it's a potent potable man
and then like an owl just existing is
fine
that's exactly what we wanted to see
quite frankly
um
so i think we rolled two owls
and then starting on the next turn
we're going to sell a
beaver and both owls and our fish and
our bird are going to be like disgusting
we want the fish to get statted for now
because the beaver's not long for this
world
doesn't scale we're just going to sell
both of them
we're going to sell them both
that's probably the best possible
hit there that's amazing
nice bat
can't really blame me if you can't beat
him join him
so
gives two random friends
plus two health
give a random friend plus two plus two
we can't afford for this to hit the
beaver
i can live with this
i don't want the peacock i don't i don't
trust it the the peacock you peace okay
we're gonna freeze you we're gonna hold
you for a couple turns because you're an
eight eight we're gonna hold you for a
couple turns
eight eight is good enough to hold
in fact well no because you get it we
get a huge benefit out of selling you
i think a spider is fine
i think we can afford to invest in this
quite frankly
we can roll two times
and then
to be honest with you
maybe we freeze you okay
but we apple
something is going to be sticking around
for a bit
not long but a bit
then you roll me one more time you get
freaking pill you piece of garbage
eight eight up at the front on turn four
it's a nasty thing to run across
don't don't hit the owl anything but the
owl that's fine drama there's a piece of
garbage anyway you know it i know it
everybody knows it
i think we win
i think
we
i think we draw
okay
owl makes me scale dude it's a 8-8
what's your problem
get pilled
get scaled
i i i like some scaling
with some super scaling
with some selling
with some batting
with some
ratting
with some
this this is a risk maybe some
we got lives to play with just keep that
in mind okay
we can buy one thing and still scale
scale me
we we we invested a lot
to make our team worse so that it will
be better later
we're getting really lucky on those on
those bats man i'm just gonna be honest
you're a piece
i think we draw though which is good
because we're a scale build right now
one of the easiest roles of my life
i don't care what you hit okay
you peace
i'm not gonna
buy and sell you to give you a random to
give a random tutu we're gonna freeze
you
for now roll you once
freeze you see how the mood strikes you
we're gonna buy you we're gonna roll you
we're gonna let the rhythm take you over
by the mouse
i don't know i hope you keep it when we
combine you we stay at two
scale me scale me
juice me sna combine me snail me if we
lose me
good good combo at the start here
7-5 loses to 5-6
2-5 does not beat five six but it's okay
this is heavy draws
we a draw where we scale i'm a very very
happy camper
unfreeze me
that's a gimme
that's a gimme
you're gonna roll me
you're gonna freeze the crap out of me
you're gonna freeze the crap
you're gonna freeze the crap out of me
you're gonna roll me one time one time
and that's it and then you're gonna end
your turn
yummy yummy yummy
i've got 15 14 16 14 papi and i feel
like poning you
uh a deer
chungus is fishy muffins sounds
delicious
okay peacock getting hit by that
probably a dream come true
we get a nice trade on the bison here
this is a loss i think
it is a loss
i'm not sweating it though
oh yeah yeah our scaling is still good
buy me
come bind me
you know what i'm realizing though the
chick is not good
because it it it soaks up the
nah it's still pretty good
i'm stupid
roll me
roll me
this is this is still totally fine this
is there's nothing wrong with this
2x puppy no because we're going to
combine them
we'd rather you scale twice as fast for
sure
feeling pretty scared as a believer
honestly i wouldn't
we got a bat we got a puppy and one of
the most important things we've got is
like a roster that we can actually
afford to sell a lot of
in order to move better things in later
like we don't have an endowment effect
for anything right now
i do think we lose this one
i do know that we lose this one but the
scaling is gonna work
i'm telling you just believe
you definitely go up a level on the
puppy
now we're scaling like a son of a gun
you're gonna
we don't want to level up the bird yet
we'd rather do it next time so we get a
higher tier animal
i have a question about the mammoth
when the mammoth falls in battle
it makes everything
to two
plus two plus two but not forever
okay there's still i take it i take it
over fish
we still get the puppy
buff always put that son of a gun up at
the front
four six melon armor scares the crap out
of me at least we don't see a bat though
that's not a big deal
that's not a big deal
you don't die in one you do die in one
i'm bad at mathematics this is a win
this is a win even with melon armor this
is a win and a half
puppy
i don't mind a a
an eagle either but you definitely start
okay okay okay okay so here's what you
do piece of piece of crap you sell the
chick
we gotta think i'm like you sell the
chick you buy a dragon
then you
prioritize buying tier ones and you
scale out of your gourd there is a
problem
it requires us to sell either the bat
the bird or the mammoth
sell the mammoth it's kind of pog
it's kind of pog though
is the thing
dragon sucks somebody didn't see our 10
win marty
have you been watching kony's tier list
there's your first mistake
we don't really need the bird anymore
it's a seven eight that hits hard once
it's buffing the chick which we don't
care about we're gonna this is gonna be
out of here it is harder to make it work
with puppy econ scaling for sure
i would like to peel them in i would
like to keep this going so we could pill
the mammoth at some point
if you can kill the mammoth yes i know
that's it you know if if i did it o.j
simpson
the future is is cloudy you know we
don't with the chance of meatballs or
otherwise
either way we're holding this
if we sell
we go to nine
six
seven
plus one plus one on everybody
puffy
puffy hmm
there's a certain
spookiness here i think you sell the
bird i think the puppy's gonna scale
well enough on his own okay
you sell the bird
yes
i'm committing you sell the chick
you buy a dragon
you buy a fish
you sell the fish
takes you to five
you buy an eagle because it's half
decent
you have to be at the front
and then i'm like
puppy at the back i don't know
puppy puppy at the i don't know i don't
know
run me
we don't want it at the front front but
maybe just behind the mammoth it does
our positions don't really matter too
much right here and we could lose this
round but this is where the scaling is
going to begin hopefully in our dream
worlds two enemies are weak not our
uh puppy which means everything's okay
we have exactly the right math to make
this look uh never mind we we have
pretty close to exactly the right math
to make this look like it's better than
it is i think we draw
because you're gonna summon a chick
that's gonna 1-1 us
still though
good trade
why not roll the last two coins you need
two coins to scale the puppy
i don't think this is a can set up yet
i think this is a puppy
a freeze me a roll me
we don't see any ones
i have to think
of
a mammoth
a freeze me
a roll me
and take some time
a level three puppy would be well it'll
hit 50 50 at which point i don't know
what we're gonna do but
11 11 deer it's a scary squad
um we're gonna we're gonna kill it in
one which is nice obviously you're gonna
summon a bus
the bus is gonna die though okay
we're gonna kill the turtle
and we're gonna take off your armor
um
we're not gonna take off your armor
though this looks like a loss for sure
but a puppy if we can get you some
garlic armor or something
that might be a bigger priority than
leveling up here early
okay we're on two wins which is now it's
getting a little spooky
one up on eagle is pretty good
but please note i'm also trying to sell
this eagle
one up on mam it's kind of sick too
yeah okay i i believe
i roll
so we could
we could go all in on the puppy but i'm
a believer
in
sell me
seven
buy me
sell me
buy me
or chocolate bat is pretty good too man
or
get well you come back as a level one no
you come as a 1-1
what the hell i think i'm going to
ignore puppy scaling this turn that's
something i feel confident in saying
this does synergize
no questions there
but it's not going to work on this turn
this is a sell me
by me and don't worry about scaling on
this turn situation
freeze me
freeze me
i don't know what you're gonna do
honestly i guess you're gonna get super
buffed by a double mammoth
it's the same damn squad man
what a rip-off not today not today you
peace
not today
you peace
it was one off
i was one off from the draw
all right that was a two win marty we'll
pay out the doubters on that one
play me in the arena
and we'll run it back
deserve for skipping t-rex i mean i'm
pretty sure t-rex loses there too
it just loses with more people in the
audience with a smile on their face
t-rex is like it's a it's a great unit
don't get me wrong but it's a scaler man
and when you're on one win like
you got to be careful about how you uh
how you put your scalers out there
low key legs man
i'll be the low key legs
i don't think it matters what you hit
dude this is a win and this is a win
with some confidence
we freeze you we don't oh you know what
we could buy you
and then roll once
we're gonna buy you as a 2-2 so we can
sell you next turn
you might laugh on this one but i
honestly think you just put a b back
here so you win ties
hey
deglock thank you for the gifted
subscription thank you
i don't buy bees too much lately but
this is a rare situation where i'm a bee
leaver
this
could be a loss
that's lucky
it's a draw
not bad
we turned the b turned that loss into a
draw
tier two animals
now will become tier three animals
you you trader
now we must buy three units i think we
freeze you just in case
i can always get down with with this
right here
i'm not sold on the bird man just to be
honest with you
swan me
it's not even close man
it's the swan of the century
freeze me
that that swan was like an instant lock
that was
very lucky
it's a nasty team that you see here this
is a nasty team
now you will buff me
you're still dying that was good luck
for us
i'm still buffing
we're trading one for one
i think we win because of our
uh no we just win i was gonna say
because of the b but we just win
i still think we keep that snail out
there i'm just being straight up with
you man
so i think you can kill an ants
love to see it
and then we're gonna buy a
peacock i am going to murder you
roll me
swan me
roll me
roll me
freeze me freeze me
unfreeze me because we're not losing
this round
i see a four nine and a four nine scares
don't shoot my flamingo you
a four nine scares me but
i lived
i lived
i see what you're doing i still think we
win
not to mention we have a b at the back
that's three wins already
is it broken
my god
you peace
it's unlikely we're gonna get it to hit
but
there is something about it okay
it's turn five
i think you freeze and then you roll
just a little just just to see man
just to see what life has in store for
you
turtle peacock is is a bit of a classic
you know what
this is a bad setup for us here it's a
nasty squad
thanks for making my peacock even
stronger
your heart is true you're a friend and a
confidant
owns
owns
little ownage your owns
easy wins baby
one of you pieces just made me lose at
nine wins
[Laughter]
i like i like that one of you pieces
dude i gotta be honest with you i don't
want to dump a turtle
i i a turtle giving two melon armor and
then we just put our fish somewhere else
or more likely sell it at some point
i i do not mind it
i know we could get the easy melon armor
i'm happy leaving it out there for now
because it scales very nicely
garlic on peacock gets eaten so don't
get it confused at some point we're
going to want to hit these the turtle
also does hard count or bad you're not
joking
we got another one coming we'll freeze
you for now just in case i like an early
garlic
i'm going to be honest i'm i'm invested
i'm investing in your future
this is the easiest freeze of my life
um
give me a combine
and then i buy
and we just leave it we leave it sitting
there so we can get the next level
swan
level two peacock still doing some work
man
this squad with a with a caterpillar
doesn't scare me too much mosquitoes
effect did very little
we crush you
we crush you
you crush us
melon armor is not as good as i'd like
it to be i still feel like we win with
the b here
or even without the b
dude are you seeing this like
we're at 5-0 right now
unfreeze me
definitely combine me
friend bot gain gold
works three times per turn
i think we might as well try
might as well can
buy me
honestly
garlic meat
you're more likely to stick around than
the goat
and then we're going heavy on we might
as well freeze this man i mean at some
point we're gonna get
we're gonna get got okay
now there's a deer function here
not really it's probably better than a
fish but
and me
4-4
the 11-14 peacock is is freaking me out
a touch
[Laughter]
we lived through this hit though no you
peace
yeah yeah we lose this one
that was just honestly things just went
some of the rng went sideways for us
it was a 50 50 though you can't really
be too mad
the time has come for us to lose a fish
to get a snail
to sell the snail
to buy a peacock
to get the juice
now bad
i think
you freeze
this is like our
this is it's coming off the bench to be
in our squad
if we get nothing better
now a turtle
has created another goat
now i'm like hold on if you have two
goats
do you get two gold back for everything
that you buy
i don't know what the heck we would get
rid of to make the space but oh my god
look at this cute baby
the and the cute mommy the combo here
look at
this i love that hat
winter combo
does have tiny ears
kate i'm i'm pogging out of control
should i play this game you would i
think you would love it
i want to play it so i can't beat my
husband i'm i've been doing pretty bad
today but overall
i'm kind of
okay
in many ways
the the buy of the goat doesn't help us
here that's the only thing that's
getting me man because it only works
three x per turn we've already done it
three x so you basically buy it five
move it over you become a nine nine
i'm i'm not a believer in the goat man
what does the goat sound like
five seven bat huh
for now we roll in this squad right here
freeze me a pair just in case i don't
know what we're buffing but freeze me a
pair
sheesh
hmm
it's a nasty hit
i i don't that was probably like three
games ago at this point
i don't have an answer for you though i
wish
though i wish that i did
hey great great goats think alike look
at this this looks like a believer
payout
look at that
i think i did i think i did sell a
kangaroo in the last run
she said explain yourself
[Laughter]
i think i did sell it after that believe
it believe it or not you probably
believe it
hurt me
i think we keep this frozen man i don't
mind keeping that bad out there just in
case
we have tier five animals like what if
we unlock because if we have tier five
animals i'd love to see some experience
i don't even know what i would be
pairing right now
you need to level something up in order
to get the boost i understand
roll button shows us could be tier fives
okay
okay
three
two five two
him me him him me
freeze me
roll me
she's loving it man
honestly i'm a believer in the can me
strat
wait a minute or am i a believer in
microbe
which will purge all their debuffs but
will maintain melon armor afterwards
am i willing to lose a swan which has
done great for us
to be honest
because the poodle's some nice scaling i
don't want to dump that this does the
added benefit of getting rid of one of
our two
tiers yeah sell swan
oh my god
kate got me uh
the largest corn dog i've ever seen in
my life oh my word
holy crap
spicy
i'm looking forward to that oh my it's
so heavy
oh man that's hilarious
my god
should have canned first i don't know if
we could have done that in order now
that i think about it but um
so there's no point in putting garlic on
anybody now
you should be unfrozen
economy doesn't matter freeze me
roll me
shakalami
shakalami
you gotta t-rex me okay so you're gonna
freeze me
for now the poodle's gonna buff
following this we're gonna sell our
goats
when we sell our goat we're gonna buy a
t-rex
the t-rex is gonna give us the scaling
we need and all three of these units are
gonna get melon armor
we don't need to give them garlic
because they're all gonna be made weak
okay
that's the strap man that's the freaking
strat
we might lose this round but from this
point onwards things are going to start
to look very nice for us hey nice bat
you got there oh no
two enemies have weakness oh no
everybody has weakness including your
stupid peacock
oh wait none of my enem none of my units
have weakness anymore
cause i'm amazing
hold on
hang on here
we still win easily
can me
sell me
juice me
we need to be at three gold or higher
so we can't really do anything except
roll twice
will freeze me
they're still good this is still good
freeze me and roll me once
we don't need another turtle maybe
splash on the micro but i don't know
freeze me here
oh
baby
nice deer uh for me to poop on
oh no i'm weak
oh no you're oh wait a minute hold on oh
no you still gotcha
oops my melon armor
oops
uh little oops for you
this guy's kind of a piece but we still
got him
i'm glad the microbes finally getting
the respect it deserves
juice me
don't make me laugh we could dump the
poodle because we have scaling
but everything is getting hit this is
beautiful
we would like if anything
we want the microbe to get a stake
we can only buy one thing
buy me some pizza
yummy yummy yummy
oh
[Laughter]
1516 level two total
you know what you you've you've
countered my build
a little
yeah okay you've taken away my my
biggest advantage this will probably be
a loss
we're lucky we're getting
we're still punching
it'll probably be a win actually is what
i meant to say
i don't think we buy cans now like we're
already scaling so fast that the cans
are
sub-optimal imo roll me once
we don't see anything we like
if we don't see anything we like we got
choices we can roll three times or we
can can i'm telling you we're not buying
anything new we're gonna roll three
times
it's it's the play
i mean i guess you could freeze a micro
it's kind of unlikely you're gonna make
it
pill microbes
it's an interesting
concept
he said about
a one-up turtle
uh that
then
gives out two melon armor
seems useless
uh the only way i can see it working is
if like the second turtle kills
something that erases all of our melon
armor and then it dies and replaces the
melon armor on top but
anyway it's it's unlikely
we'd probably
deploy our resources elsewhere
who frees you though
oh the microbe takes off the one up uh
takes off the one up anyway
yeah yeah this is for win 10 man this is
crazy
1819
this is a nasty squad no doubt about it
they do lose their melon armor though
on the 3636
this chicken is kind of a it's a counter
to what we got going on at least it was
only a level one
this only blocks 20 so
36 36 we we lose okay sorry we got stuff
to play with
we got lives to play with we're scaling
i'm not worried about it we lost uh kind
of on stats that time
roll me once
god i'd love a freaking poodle man
it's a very easy build to pilot right
now
what the hell
it's the same build but i think mine's a
little better it's like the same build
we still got the punch a little yeah we
win
probably
yeah yeah yo baby 10 wins
pay out the believers on that one
there's a new style built for us we
actually we we ran a micro build in the
past
oh baby
um but we we got rid of it before the
end now hey we've proven
you can at least give it a roll you can
give it a try
cheers to that i'll drink to that
brother
that's pretty good
that's pretty good
that's pretty good all right run the
bets back
look
i'm a variety streamer okay
but i'm also a simple man
i see 8 200 viewers in a chat that loves
watching
super auto pets it's very hard for me to
not just play more super auto pits
it's doing very well for itself it's
it's just fun man it's just it's just
fun
yeah pretty much all of it ends up
on on the old youtubes as well
as as we like to call it in the business
it's a weird start but
sure
we're begging for some wario ware i
don't know man i don't know but it's so
it's so fun though but it's here's the
thing is like this game is good don't
shoot my ants you're a piece just so you
know
pig pig pig me pig me
you peace whatever
it's double peoro build
this week yeah that's one reason i'm
like
not totally sold dude one of the reasons
we won
so well last time
is because we won early like those early
wins were big helps
so i'm honestly i'm gonna tell you
this is a straight up
real situation we sell you
you buff me
we buy you
we buy ya
we freeze you we roll you
we buy ya
we ant ya
we roll ya
we accept
dude the beetle can get kind of scary in
the early to mid game
a 2 3 is nasty
this is good
our front two trade for their front two
then we beat you
then
we live that's a win
caps are making them look angry i don't
disagree there was there was some anger
involved there
so it's definitely a
it's a pump it's a pump
that's not that bad
i think it's a pill
before you pill
no you can't do it that way well you
know you could hold on you could sell
beaver first
nice buff
run the chick there
freeze me
get you next time roll me
sell me
bat me
it doesn't get any better than that
early bat and uh
the ultimate beetle
we trade you got a 910 fish please
weaken my 910 fish enemy

i was i'm like he's got a 910 i'm so
upset but i'm like i guess i got a 911

no that's an above average team we're
not gonna run into too many more teams
that are that strong okay
i'll live with it
roll me
i believe in a drama dairy just listen
to the rhythm of my heart
okay um
you buy one fish freeze the other this
is a springboard for us into the future
there is a part of me that's like you
know what we could do
try something like this instead roll me
one time
freeze me one time
garbage garbage team please
eleven five at the back a little spooky
but
oh
pov you're eating my butt
one in five baby
[Laughter]

a contest
so we're going to sell this son of a gun
you got it it's got to be done
we're gonna buy you
now
if i buy you and put you here do we get
the trigger
yes because it's a buy not a summon
so it totally works
but we could also
sell a fish
by you
we could do this in any order i don't
know why you're
being so weird about it
for
for now
sell me
juice me
yummy yummy
roll me one time hence maybe freeze me
and roll me one time hence
combine me
buy me freeze me
this bison's gonna pop the frick off man
i know it's a buff buffalo has the
narciss prince
you know what i'm talking about you've
played super punch-out
owns
not a big deal this is a draw
it's a draw but we're scaling
you love to see that so this is a it's a
pill me
it's a garlic me
i think it's a
roll me
so freeze me
it's an unfreeze me
it's a freeze me
it's a roll me
it's a freeze me
it's a roll me
it's an intern
sell by him you
yo you got to freeze the snail man
it's just science
peacock week is good buffalo week is bad
but
oh it's not going to be much of an issue
it looks like
actually we might draw
[Laughter]
all right great team name by the way
that that puppy did some work for you
see you in the future when you're
scaling and i'm scaling and we're both
scaling him me him him me
oh we got it we gotta try
we don't have to try the fish though
it's not that kind of place
we're not gonna get a level three friend
you jus you say no to that
what i think you do i think you do buy
and then i think it's not the worst
thing in the world to have a bat that
hits hard
you got an eagle already
level two bat you're a piece you're a
piece
this blowfish is gonna hurt me pretty
bad
that's actually like probably the best
that could have gone this is a loss for
sure
we would have drawn if we'd had one more
hp
don't don't worry we're scaling that's
what i'm saying we're scaling the scale
you you you get out of here you stink
you own
yummy yummy
romy
we need some garlic on you let's be real
we also need some stats on you but we'll
settle for garlic right now meat could
have done it as well
freeze me
freeze me
it's our last life man this this one's
big
1011 rhino we're looking for rhino
infanticity please
we can
do something
we can thank you at least i think
whatever
it's not that bad
i think this could be a draw
can i just ask you how you got a
caterpillar to pop so quickly
because i'm just going to be straight up
with you it seems kind of like like like
bs seems kind of like bs
we gotta hit you
now we start getting some turbo buffs
you need stats
i think the fish
you sell the fish to buy a poodle
after all that
yes
i hate the sound man
and then we we need some benefit this is
a good buy but this if we don't buy this
this could be goodbye
yummy yummy yummy
1011 please
please
don't weaken me not at the front not at
the front
oh we might have a chance
we needed to not get batted
i'll take it man
yummy yummy yummy
yummy yummy yummy
yummy yummy yummy
yummy yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum
yum yum yum yum
it totally works freeze me
hit me one of these two is gonna get
freaking rolled man i know what you're
thinking rooster rooster him me it
doesn't get buffed by the poodle
unfortunately
freeze me
freeze me
roll me
juice me
i think it's more important early
that you get the bat
sauropod
we're not really on a food build
i'm happy to have a tier six don't get
me wrong
why not buy the bat instead though
i'm going to become the joker
does that answer your question
this is a loss
[Laughter]
even if we bought the bet we still lost
but yeah that's a loss three wins four
losses
it's all right it happens i'm telling
you we're going for at least another
hour
start my predictions and then also we'll
put a slash marker
sap 3
take a bite of the corn dog



it's freaking huge man
it's too big
i love it though
new hat
pamela head
i think we need this we need to wait
until we can buy the golden poop pad
like it's such a flex
we're gonna go back to free to play
temporarily
this is a squad
this is a squad man
we like a cricket
that gets buffed
with a horse
and an ant and a duck
the bumbling fingers
the order doesn't work dude if you buy
the horse first everything else gets
plus one plus one or no it just gets
plus one attack for the fight i want a
qriket to be 2-3 for the long term
that's a permanent statistical bonus
mind you it still leads to a draw here
is it it's permanent oh well disregard
that then
what do i know
buff
roll
it's permanent it's not oh it's not
permanent shut the heck up
you liars
don't even know what you're talking
about
yummy yummy you don't this this run does
not lose
like look we got a full squad we got
full stats
any stats gained in the marketplace
screen are perfect or are permanent i
should say
okay well if we have a two-two
duck in our arsenal then you're not
trucked if we don't have a 2-2
duck in our arsenal you'll excuse me but
i might be sending you to the trunk
this this one is a loss though
their horse beats our horse stuff
mcgruff
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
thank you
appears to be a 1-2 which is a little
surprising
unless you're saying like maybe when we
bought it it was a zero two
except for the fact that
it's not a zero two obviously because
there's a one so what's up with this one
then
it's okay i'm just asking you to say
sorry i would i'm not asking you to
apologize for being wrong i'm merely
asking you to apologize for saying
you're absolutely right i have 100
confidence
and then being wrong if you were like i
think it's like this and then it wasn't
that's life man everybody makes mistakes
but if you're like it literally is
permanent three question marks
that's all i have all i ask is for some
humility and some understanding okay
now you get sold
you could roll a dog build here man i'm
i'm like so on top of my headphone cor
hold on a moment please
hold on a moment
dawg we've gotten some good wins with
dog lately
it's only round three
there's nothing wrong with that
now the order on this one is actually by
sell
buy
because the dog will get a plus one plus
one from the duck instead of just a plus
one or
zero one
so
buy
buy me
sell me
4-4 dog
nothing wrong with that
exist me
5'4
freeze me i respect the three seven
peacock that's pretty good freeze one of
these we're not gonna be able to do
everything we wanna do
that's okay
you know what we could actually if we
i'm contented to sell an otter
even at 2 3
to buy a peacock
to buff the dog
to swallow a fly
we want the best chance for the ant to
hit the peacock which is
um hold on
look
it's a little goofy okay but there's no
reason you can't there's nothing in the
text that says
a dog can't play basketball
the only thing is now if we're putting a
b we kind of miss out a little bit
so i think i'm willing to run my chances
actually with
this
this this
be me because we can't put a b on our
we could put this on you we can't run a
b on our um
well you know what actually if we pill
you this will give us a nice buff on the
dog so i don't think that's that i think
that's actually accidentally good
but we can't put the b on the cricket
because it won't summon a cricket
okay
have you discussed the most imp you
piece
have you discussed the most important
news of the week
your
uh super not super mega baseball but
nintendo switch baseball
youtube short reaching 1 million views
yeah it was crazy when i saw that
i don't know uh i don't know what
algorithmic like hot sauce it got
attached to but
it did cross a million views the one
where i i throw them the mind eraser
short's algorithm is like it's out of
control man so we dump you
yummy yummy
yummy yummy yummy yummy then we sell you
sorry sorry thanks for being a part of
the organization
which means we actually could pill you
to get a summon for one but then we
would lose a 3-4 which is not amazing
you know i actually kind of like a buy
yummy
followed by a cell
yummy
and then a freeze into a roll
now if you're gonna roll this
personally i think you roll two horses
and then you combine the peacock
you save the pill because i think it
will work nicely on a cricket i mean for
like one gold we pill the cricket it
gives a dog trigger then we sell the
cricket that it creates and we get our
gold back that's a bargain man
yeah i don't know the baseball video it
went it went thermonuclear man
this is uh upsetting i'm pretty sure we
draw here
alas it is what it is
when triple platinum which you think i
sold them all
now there's something to be said about a
turtle everybody loves the turtle
excuse me
there's also something to be said
however about a flamingo
excuse me excuse me
him me him him me that gives us a sick
buff
turtle did so well for us last time it's
hard for me to not say yes to a turtle
let's put a turtle in front of our
peacock temporarily
and i also feel like
a
bee on the turtle why not with three
gold why not
it buffs our dog
again now we can kill the turtle for one
get a dog trigger get melon armor on the
peacock and then sell the bee back to
the shop for one
we know yeah oh okay a level two horse
surprise surprise how exciting
big whoop
this is an interesting one that that
early rooster scares the crap out of me
but our peacock is going to be quite
strong
it's going up against
that that ox is gonna is upsetting for
me but i still think we we trade it
i think we draw
i think we draw
just barely
you peace we lose i forgot that was a
horse has other benefits okay we had two
losses two losses
life goes on
freeze me
horse me
screw you
pill me
thrill me
chill
kill me
thrill me
selm
sell me
roll me
buy me
try me
[Laughter]
what is going on here i'm a little
confused too
just to be honest with you
that's a good start kangaroo we need
this kangaroo to get strong enough to
live through
the otter please
i'm skeptical about that one
uh if as long as it trades with the
otter i'm not sweating it too much
oh it's gonna trade with the horse
that's so much better
this is a win
at least your dog isn't exclusively
health this time ain't that the truth
man
ain't that the truth
that was i i felt like the game was
broken when that happened
so it's a this is a sell me
i'm all i'm just being real with you
okay i'm honestly like this is a buy me
you get
a buff you get a buff you get a buff
and then you're gonna thrill me
i think you're gonna
smell me
now a deer is not so bad that's that's
like freezable i you know what i think
just for this one
you can roll
a deer
and then pear me
i prefer the kangaroo behind our peacock
right now
this dog's only an 11 11 11 though he's
got a long way to go
hmm
this doesn't seem that bad
because our splash damage is gonna is
gonna do some serious work here
that's not that that's actually a dream
come true
because we we ate your buff with our
melon armor now you got a 2-2 sure your
dog's getting a little stronger big
whoop
now our this is a win
that's even better for us honestly i
think
no well even better is
it's not even better but it's okay
then you got a b that doesn't matter at
all
then you got a cricket that doesn't
matter at all
and then you got a dog it doesn't matter
at all easy win
certainly seems cannibal
and remember we have a flex position
it's our deer
the deer is good but it's not part of
our long-term game plan it's good in the
mid game it's not part of our long-term
game plan nor is the horse for that
matter but i think
you can sell me
buy me
i'd really love to get to a level two
dog
roll me
it's
disgusting
sell me
buy me
freeze me i guess roll me
hippo me
how do we buff our hippo that's the real
question it's it's turn 8 is a little
late
freezing
sorry i was a little hungry
have you really been playing auto pets
for three hours not only that i haven't
even gotten up man
like i've literally just been sitting
here
like deliberately dehydrated myself
before the stream
our kangaroo's dead man that's a
disappointment or maybe it isn't
it's barely
not just glued to the herman miller i
took a shower before the stream so i
wouldn't have to deal with my own stink
now i'm eating a 3 000 milligram sodium
corn dog
dude this is like
this kangaroo is is is
you know what now that i look at it i'm
actually scared to death of this shark
yeah we lose this after all that we lose
this
what a shark man
so we only have one life left to live
we know it's a cell
and then we we hope it's a bye
then we're gonna unfreeze you
eight nine is okay
give him some garlic
i really think our only hope i mean this
is big we
if we're not gonna buff the the crap out
of him forget that you're a piece
roll me
you could sell a horse
you know i'm selling a horse ride in the
cowboy
it's it's just this no it's not enough
it's not enough to get us to the snail i
wish that it were
i mean i think you'd
pray for the best
it is if you sell the dog too i'm not
willing to go that deep
it's a little too spicy for me
well our hippo meta has failed us don't
melon me though don't you okay you peace
you don't mellow me you peace
we trade with the kangaroo we got a
turkey and a shark that's a pretty heavy
f potential
yeah that's a loss
[Laughter]
why do you know the meta
and yet you haven't even made an account
yet
from this point onwards
i resolve
we're never gonna try horse build maybe
early game will run hoarse but i got too
attached to it
a lot of the problems you run into in
this life
are due to uh
are due to over commitments no doubt
about it
it's an interesting squad you know you
want ant
we can freeze both of these try a very
simple one re-roll
i mean i'm gonna be honest with you you
roll double duck man
i don't care to keep you
maybe i'll keep you frozen for now
the flooded flexible fossils
it's my nickname for
helen mirren that's not that's just mean
i'm sorry
sorry ellen my mistake
don't shoot my ants please
all right
we draw we draw
we draw that's fine crunchy fossils
versus flexible
freak you man
i care about you
sell me
sell me
freaking freaking 5-4 fish bud
freaking 5-4 fish bud
we have to buy the horse okay
the reason we have to buy the horse
is because
yeah we have to buy the horse we need to
fill four spaces which we can't really
hold on let me think let me think about
this okay this is a this is a buy
everything
you start a horse we really want to win
this round
then
ideally
fish would get hit by the beaver level
up
[Applause]
which would happen right here
this is a nasty squad man this squad is
nasty
you do not even though we've only got
four you don't want to roll up to this
squat that's not a beaver that's an
otter my mistake
don't shoot my my otter
all right well
nevertheless
owns
owns
owns best of luck to you
fish is like the most underrated front
unit man it's it's pretty it's pretty
spiced
i'm gonna be honest with you stats are
not the worst thing in the world
so you can roll
an elephant at the back
just for some wins
he gets buffed
he gets buffed
we then fish once
we see nothing that appeals to us
as a result
we give you a little meat
and a little squeeze i think this is
we're headed for a 2-1 here this is a
strong build here
should have made the ant buff well
actually i like the idea that the ant
could buff excuse me level two horse
already you peace
all right i just
i'm revising my goal down to a draw
thank you
owns
owns never mind we win easily
great name though loose legs great name
it's very simple
i'm going to need you to pill me
it's not really what i was looking for
but that's okay following this i'm going
to need you to thrill me
peacock elephant i don't respect
i have respected it at times in my life
i don't think i respect it right now
however
we are you're right we're a little
starved for options so our most likely
units to stick around are peacock and
fish
let's buff the peacock
fish is already pogging i'm buying more
food this time
what an interesting build you have here
we don't mind that we don't mind that
i lived
the cricket's gonna kill us but that's
that's life man
then we get a superior trade
we get a a nice trade you create two
enemies
that will not punch through my fish and
we're gonna win
i thought you were against horse build
we were forced
that we had four things to buy 12 gold
and 4 empty spaces we had to buy
everything that's the only reason we're
on horses right now i'm looking for a
reason to get rid of them
rabbit food is interesting
i'm gonna give it a try okay sell me
squeeze me
eat me
that's food
garlic's food
peacock me freeze me
dodomi roll me
we stand to gain nothing from that but
that's okay
might want to move our units around by
the way do we still take one from the
elephant every time even with some
garlic but that's okay that dodo's gonna
do some work for us next time
big
whoop you peace
dude we do we we trade with the dolphin
or we we kill the dolphin we trade with
the aunt
no we don't deserve garlic armor
that being said this is a draw but still
three wins one loss one law zero losses
it's a simple pog me
it's a very simple pog me
it's a roll me
you you know how we do it the otter goes
gets replaced with a kangaroo at some
point this dodo is going to come into
play
you know you know what you know run
puffer fish behind elephants got some
interesting plays too
we got two hertz synergies though i
guess an elephant that gets upgraded
would hit twice you know what in that
case freeze me
unfreeze me roll me
freeze me
interesting
very interesting idea chat very
interesting
what's that kangaroo doing why you why
don't you wait two seconds to see
this is not ideal
this is a strong build the warmish
buttocks they got a strong build we
lived thankfully you're gonna summon a
heck of a chicken here
we're gonna live through this though
which is incredible for me and then
you're gonna summon another chicken
but then we're gonna kill you
and
we're not even trading dude the garlic
armor is doing incredible work and we're
smacking you
and now our kangaroo's kicking the crap
out of you
that's the greatest garlic armor you're
ever gonna see in your life
screw it dude let's try
that being said a rhino freaking rips
man
sell me
buy me
i don't love anything maybe you do it
like that instead
so that the kangaroo has a chance to get
a couple triggers
salad me
freeze me
i think we're gonna end up selling the
rabbit for a rhino
but i don't know how i'm gonna get you
how i'm gonna get you you pumped you
know
how am i going to get you pumped
because you don't get the buffer i guess
we'll just buy some food for you in the
future but
this will be weird
sorry i'm corn dogging it
well
that's pretty bad
please
that's okay this will be weird
please hit the dolphin oh you peace
we take one we take one
and we beat you i don't believe it
all skill baby
five wins
it's a simple turn
for a simple man
buy me
buy me
buy me
roll me
freeze me
i don't even think we freeze a can man
not an ideal start a rhino will perish
you peace
this looks bad
and yet
let's go
snipe that melon armor all right it's
still pretty good
is it
is it pretty good
we came so close to drawing just your
freaking level two kangaroo man
if that was a level one we win because
you're a level two we draw
oh dude we have so much life left to
play with i'm like i'm pogging
okay so our kangaroo sucks but they also
maybe have just had some bad luck
so i think for now we like we like the
squad okay
you get sold for now you get bought for
now
we roll once
you don't say
can me
sell me
buy me
feed me
freeze me
everyone just
shut the hell up for a second okay
they don't synergize okay
i'm gonna do a sell me by me though uh
the penguin only it makes our elephant
plus one plus one better uh look m the
peacock eventually but i prefer this for
now
13 12 you peace one day
one day this rhino is actually gonna get
to work
the day is not today this looks terrible
for me
shoot that chick please
you peace
yeah this is pretty bad
this one just never had a chance
[Laughter]
we if if our rhino lives through the
first enemy we are pogging okay
it's just never happened yet we didn't
have space for a next level unit to
spawn
buy me
i love that
buy me
this is a sell me by me
but we could do it next turn
so that we at least get some little
benefit out of it right now
that's a freeze me freeze me
live
just live if our rhino just lives man
just get one kill
oh
it's a level one deer this might be the
dream
this might be the dream
get killed get smacked
get killed
get smacked
get hit that's fine dude
except for the splash damage that was
pretty sick
[Laughter]
but then you're a 13-27
you peace
this rhino is a piece of garbage man
hold on everyone chill okay it's gonna
be fine just gotta win one more for the
believers

whatever okay i see the buffs coming in
guess what you get smacked
good smack
then smack him
come on we gotta punch through a little
bit man
it's not enough

you peace
right we got five wins and then like
four straight losses
it hurts but you know what we're running
it back
we're running it back because it's that
kind of day this this freaking garlic

ready
three animals
what's wrong with you
you're never gonna win with three i mean
maybe if you had like a
like a 6 6 or something early you could
make it work but
that's pretty hot man that's a hot play
one thing's for certain
we love this
early dodo that's buffed is pretty nice
then we kind of love this to be honest
then i'm thinking i'm a big believer in
this
i gotta be honest this is a bit of a
nasty fish
normally i'd be like all over the ant
but a 3-4
that's actually a 4-4
then you freeze me this damn cupcake
then you buy me this dodo
then you play the cupcake on the dodo
four or five fish you piece of junk you
piece of crap
this looks
this looks okay
now the horse build begins
we don't need much
there we go good win the naughty
organisms
this is a romy
don't don't don't do this we're not
rolling horses long-term okay that's not
the strategy
this is not the strategy i'm invoking
now a peacock
with a little statistical advantage
early is kind of pog
i was just stupidly
hoping at some point
you might give me a copy of something i
already had but what was i thinking
i'm i'm just going off man
i'm going local
it literally gave you horse and fish
yeah but they suck
have i discovered the secret to pogging
just buy a dodo and give it cupcakes
we're already up to four wins
oh okay okay everyone chill out
blanca
the dodo gets buffed every turn
combine me
peacock's still pretty pog
just gonna be honest
maybe you sell a horse now
slide the dodo back
run a little peacock up here
run a little penguin back here
roll me
freeze me
roll me
is that's a freeze
sell a fish get a giraffe up there next
time
maybe
no cupcakes this turn though oh [ __ ]
you're you're not wrong no no cupcakes
level two mosquito
honestly like that penguin was not gonna
do anything that's probably the best
possible outcome for me
this is a loss though that that pig's
very strong the unwashed teapots
they're rolling penguin build too
they're they're penguins buffing that
mosquito give you they'll give you the
respect i'll put some respect on your
name right now
sell me
thrill me
sell me of course
this dodo is a 7 8 by default that's
pretty amazing
giraffe n turn buff the dodo i don't
care to buff the dodo though
i care
to buff the peacock i think because the
dodo getting buffed
wait oh no it's n turn you're absolutely
right my mistake
that's my mistake
we're going to start like this
it doesn't have to be to the side that's
just it's just science
pop me in
i i i know i understand what's happening
here okay just give it a sec we want
something like this
or the penguin it doesn't really matter
then we're gonna cupcake the [ __ ] out of
you
[Laughter]
that that cupcake is a nice value add
man
i thought the giraffe was buffed the
dodo every turn it's it's buff the dodo
sorry buff the
dodo every turn in battle it's not it's
buff the dodo every every time you begin
a round of auto chess
is don't get me wrong it's a bit of a
nasty blowfish here
in fact like oh frick that's horrible
you peace
they won't do it again
you peace whatever i still win get owned
thanks for the cupcake
five wins
did i say tier six animals oh tier four
i'm also unlocked okay
sure yeah um
you can go
in exchange for you
in exchange for you
roll me
i don't see a cupcake
i do see a dodo
i know i know what you're thinking trust
me it's better rolled up it's better if
you roll it up
i think we're gonna go it's a temporary
kangaroo but we're gonna go kangaroo
temporarily
i don't i don't really feel and need to
roll the food for the time but we're
gonna do it like that
we really want garlic armor though
garlic garlic armor is like the next top
tier benefit here
peacock's going down unfortunately
never mind again i can't do math
as long as our kangaroo gets
some
hp that's the only thing i ask for
because obviously their kangaroos
getting stronger here
you oh my god you summoned a ram you
piece
that literally i'm you can't even be mad
like that's literally just like
congratulations like god smiled upon you
what can you say
all skill baby
deer in front of kangaroo does work but
it kind of it cannibalizes a bit of our
build here
cannibalizes a bit of a milk
i like this okay i like this
i really want a peacock man
garlic armor is going to win us the game
forget these scumbags
forget them
forget him man
give me garlic in peace
what the hell is this
[Laughter]
okay five five bus actually just bodies
my kangaroo
that's terrible news
this seems insanely bad
i will fast forward again
my points i if i were a believer i would
be i would be concerned about your
points i would be i'm not gonna lie to
you what's the point
we're past that
you know you're gonna need this
holy [ __ ]
for now
a giraffe being sold
just we just need to win
one round
for the believers that's it
we win one round for the believers
then everything's cool man
everything's cool
i don't know what we want to live longer
i think maybe our kangaroo not getting
splashed would be a nice addition to the
squad
forget this forget this man
the fly is gonna make the kangaroo
better if the kangaroo lives through no
deer no deer is nice
what the heck is this
what is this squad
it's only a level one dodo
this fly
thank you thank good you tried
hey you're soaking up some uh extra
damage it'll be relevant at some point
this is a win okay so the believers we
made it we made it we juiced it we
squeezed it
and can i tell you now we got garlic on
this peacock up at the front
i saw her face now i'm a believer
not a trace
of doubt in my mind
the croc of the the
shot everyone shut up
the kangaroo gets sold
in order to or the penguin
kangaroo is sold
in order to roll shark
which behind fly is gonna freaking
own dude
now i'm not gonna lie to you
it's not the most optimistic penguin
i've ever seen in my life
nevertheless
persisted
snake build
a little scary on the snake build
because it could snipe my shark pretty
easily
but if we could just get the shark to
scale
oh [ __ ]
this is a nasty one
good smack that had to happen no garlic
armor on you this oh frick not the shark
oh [ __ ]
get him dude not the shark you beast
that's also really bad you peace
we're so close
if we had a little room to work with
there we would have done it but you know
what
can't be mad
we did get six wins or more
still six wins
believers get paid
we're rolling it man



but i'm like i'm
this we've been in a game drought for a
bit
it feels nice to be on the other side of
the game drought and and be enjoying the
pure pog
it does
wasn't there wario today
yep
we're the dry mouths
if they want to make me play more
warioware then they can make the
challenges good
instead of bad
okay
how does that strike you how does that
tickle your fancy
i'm dodging puro yeah make it an auto
battler
plus we're probably not even caught up
on the amount of time we played wario
where
when you look at the amount of time we
played
super auto pets is my guess
buy me
buy me for now
roll me
sell me
you peace
freeze me roll me
buy me
unfreeze me send me no
don't send me unsend me
that probably won't make a difference
but it could in theory
i don't mind a horse getting a little
stronger it doesn't bother me too much
we live
we trade
i think this is a draw
i think i actually used to win my
mistake
yeah there's going to be a lot of super
auto pets on the youtube channel over
the weekend because it's all i've played
on twitch
which is not true we played slappy ball
and gardic phone yesterday
but yeah we're in we're in an
unprecedented era of non-variety just
temporarily
sell me
combine me this is risky we're taking a
risk
you're a piece
you're a piece
we can
we can buy you just to chill at the back
roll once
i'm going to be honest with you i don't
mind having a 4-5 on the squad
freeze me
make me stronger than yesterday
i think the rat blows i do not think the
rat is good
but
it fills up a space
and it's the stats are okay not great
but okay
you know what though
having a dirty rat on the enemy team
prevents the cricket from summoning a
bee
might help us this looks like a loss
though never mind it totally doesn't
all right that's a loss that's fair
enough
i thought it was going to screw up its
capacity
hello dodo
hello
newman
sell me
buy me
sell me
stats are okay
dodo me dog me
peace me you peace
i hate this [ __ ]
roll me
buy me
kill me
i don't know man
a ram is pretty good
that's that's a not bad situation but
it's not that amazing either i mean we
spent a lot on nothing
not at the front what's wrong with you
there's not even any reason to have it
at the front
shoot my aunt oh that's the one time i
wanted to shoot it so that we could have
the space
oh no okay at least the kangaroo is not
great
at the front at least
god this would be this would be an
incredible draw man
holy crap
we did it
still two wins one loss
early deer
kind of sick man
um
i think we want to pivot hard we want to
pivot hard here
we're going to sell
a pig and an elephant
in order to roll
a turtle and a blowfish the order is all
screwed up
you need to go on you
i don't think we're going to roll sheep
long term i think we're going to start
working it out of there
an ox i don't trust
melon will override garlic you're
absolutely right you're absolutely right
not a big deal
good smack
very good smack
acceptable
this is a win man
somehow still cruising three wins
we're not rolling rams we're not rolling
crickets
we're rolling in general i still think
we keep a garlic up there just for
just for safe keeping
and you know what i like you
and you know what
i'm gonna be honest with you
i hate to sell you but i love to thrill
you give me a kangaroo behind a ram
it's going to get a lot of triggers off
of the sheep minimum
freeze me
roll me
freeze me because i want you to buy me i
want you to buy me and then we're going
to accelerate through on the next one
kangaroo's going to get a little garlic
now we want no
splash damage that's a 10-10 pig with
the fedora up at the front
that's that's something you don't like
to see hey we're screwing up your spider
a little bit though
the pig is gonna die
the snail's gonna die
we kill the rooster we scale past it
we kill you
we scale we kill you we're scaling
we kill you
you're lucky you're like you peace you
peace you're not lucky get owned
that's value town
unfreeze me don't even know why i lost
the confidence
crocodile me
seven damage to the last enemy i feel
like there's pretty strong in the
free-to-play world
feel like you end up going up against uh
a lot of turkeys
a lot of horses a lot of early dogs but
hear me out here first i want to see if
i can get a
pill so i can get the melon armor on
this
i'm willing to go pretty i'm willing to
go down to four
in fact i think i'm going to go down a
three
or i'm going to go down a two
i'm willing to go down to i'm willing to
go down to four
acceptable
that's where we have to stop it because
the next role a pill would make it
impossible to purchase
goodbye my friend
if you give me a pill i'm gonna flip my
freaking lid
oh
i'm flipping my lid for a different
reason altogether that's i'm not even
sweating it man
i'm not even sweating it we don't care
about this anymore
hippo has screwed us a couple of times
here i don't think the hippo build is
the play i think we're we get level
three blowfish we focus on getting the
blowfish
to pop
maybe get something that triggers the
blowfish put some garlic armor on the
blowfish now
okay it's a strong kangaroo
you're lucky you're also a piece
go ahead
make my day
go ahead
make my day
okay owns
this this peacock is getting pretty
strong yeah this is not looking great
six we need more than six it's not quite
good enough yeah this is a loss
it's a strong build
you know what wait we have stuff to play
with right
this is we have one life left after this
no we have two lives left
that's fine man
you don't have to start canned food here
because it doesn't benefit
us on that purchase
you can freeze canned food roll once
see where you stand
hello my friend we meet again
this is an easy buy in my world
no scaling is bad
ah
it's hippo at least it's only a level
one
the turtle i'm not happy with the snipe
because the turtle just happened to
exist but
this this hippo is going to scale out of
control man
it gets two per kill
hmm yeah it's not looking great
how dare you
well
turns out that the turtle in the back
was a pretty shrewd maneuver
the sheep blows yeah we don't like we
need to find a replacement and we need
the money to to
finance it is the problem
and immediately like okay here we go the
only problem is
do you believe in cans
i think you gotta
try sell me
four four deer still unlikely to
accomplish basically anything
like i guess you roll a penguin
temporarily
this would be
a surprise against the turkey sheep dog
build
this would be a surprise
this is looking pretty horrible
bit of a nasty squad oh my word
no no freaking garlic yeah that's that's
an l on this one
it happens
i'm just gonna speed it up a little bit
okay four wins four losses
pay out the doubters
you know the bets are set nicely because
we're constantly running into two
different comments one is why do i ever
believe and then the other one is six
wins is too easy and it just happens
over and over and over again based on
literally the most recent data point
i'm going you know like
you just stay on one build until you get
pissed off and then you move to the next
one so i stayed on
uh
pay to win until i got pissed off with
bats and then i went back to free to
play and now i'm pissed off with turkeys
so now i'm going back to
pay to win to get pissed off with bats
again
it's not a bad start here
i think you're more likely
oh sorry i haven't started my prediction
yet
we can freeze a cricket in case we like
it we're gonna put it up here roll me
again
beaver's not a bad cell
so unf unfreeze you because you stink
the beaver we're investing in round two
basically we're investing in round two
i think you you get a believe in the
bird that believes in itself
we might lose round one it happens
for the illegal ice cubes
two four three four that's hell man
as hell
i think we draw
a bit spooky
then
it ain't no lie baby
sell
buy buy
roll
what's the best well we can have some
banter today okay what's the best
song from the boy band era
bye bye bye
i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you mine okay
mine is a slightly different answer
freeze me
don't freeze me we're getting level twos
next time
um
mine is larger than life by the
backstreet boys i i think they
i think they brought it on
on larger than life
like that's maybe the only song from the
boy band era i would ever describe as
going hard
it's another draw thankfully
the creamy bits track one on the on the
backstreet boys best-selling album
millennium larger than life
i guess i only froze one of them huh
well if we're not gonna tear up here
then we like this guy didn't listen to
five baby when the lights go out every
single word you cannot express my love
and tenderness i'll show you what it's
all about baby say you will succumb to
me so baby come to me when the lights go
out as you think i didn't listen to five
just because i wasn't born in essex
just because i've never shot a music
video inside of a bowling alley before
act like you've been there before
i'm looking for a gift for my aunts i'm
looking for an ant for my aunts i guess
we should have bought flamingo instead
what was i thinking man
the hell was i thinking
you should be glad you aren't from essex
you know what give me this
one of the ladies on on
too hot to handle is from essex
i don't think i've honestly understood
like it's not her accent it's literally
just the the words that come out of her
mouth i'm just like
we gotta we gotta get this lady like um
like a my fair lady type situation man
she's i i apologize this is regionally
insensitive i'll stop short of saying
it's racist but she'll just say stuff
like i left a dinger in the loo today
and i was like lady you're wearing like
a
a bikini right now
i don't want to hear about the fact that
you still got a you got smoke coming off
the barrel of the gun
like okay everyone chill for a second
i'm thinking
buff me
freeze me
squeeze me
parched
me
i live in essex it's not that bad better
than vancouver anyway
it's crazy um i mean you might be right
i doubt it
do people that are from uh outside of
essex routinely say things like oh yeah
i'm from essex
in bc if you're not from vancouver
island everybody's like i'm from
vancouver and then i'm like oh me too
where do you live and they're like maple
ridge and i'm like shut the [ __ ] up
you [ __ ] liar
i wouldn't actually it's just a it's
just an emote
squeeze
pill bird me bird me
you bird
roll me
flamingo me
you know what no no no screw that man
screw that
sell me this is a mistake but then swan
me
you wanna roll swan here
and then i think we're going to keep
this swann for a bit
so let's do it like that
not going to lie i'm feeling pretty good
right now as a doubter okay i mean we
have some scaling
if you if you feel good more power to
you this double peacock's got me a
little bit freaked i'm not gonna lie
never mind it's uh inconsequential
um okay never mind we are going this
this caterpillar is going freaking [ __ ]
wild man
we lose our first round here
you peace
i just need to level something up please
this is a roll
this is a juice and a squeeze
if i dare say so myself right there
nice that's a big buff man
roll me
roll me freeze
freeze me roll me
sell me
buy me
kiss me
no bats
no bats some strong units here i'm not
gonna lie
the dry sailors
oh you are you're getting some some good
intel off that don't get me wrong
but
feeling good okay we're back we're back
one and one now we gotta go six four but
that's why you don't look down on a
cupcake in my house okay
tier 4s
finally don't mind if i do you're a
piece of crap we're not going to get to
a next level bison don't waste my time
hello chibly chibly check this out
corn dog
isn't this like your generation's
favorite food
i didn't even post it on instagram how
does that make you feel
genji
it's not a threat i was stretching my
lat stretching my lateralis process
i'm just thinking okay
i think we do
i think we do this
even though i understand the complaints
i don't give two hoots about a bison
we buy you for future considerations
honestly give me give me one of these
freeze me
freeze good freeze good freeze get good
i'm not sold on you anymore i'm not sold
on you
here's my impression of george harrison
i got my
got my i'm my fish i'm not sold on you
my fish have not sold on you
oh man
you peace
well that's bad news
we lose to the peacock exclusively
thanks to this bet
that hurts
that's just pain there's not much you
can do about it it's just pain
yes
now i know
every previous time we've tried this
it has failed but this time
this time it's gonna work
this is the this is the one man we can't
scale it though we gotta we gotta leave
it at the front i think i think he's a
front front facing marty
yeah he needed that cupcake please
please
dear maybe oh we do really well against
the bat
don't weaken me it's level one your
peace you peace
why are you such a peace man
are you kidding me
you know what we trade this is a draw
thankfully
i hate this damn bat man
okay the beetle and the fish are both
leaving probably the beetle first the
fish has better stats
the rhino needs buffs
no sweat
none of these matter like it's you know
what a turtle
turtle probably is nice on snail so
let's start there let's let's start
there this is this is what the swan
gives you
rhino at the back is honestly is just
too bold for me to consider it
but you know what i will consider
melon armor
on a rhino
i feel like it's slightly too late for a
buffalo man
not much
just slightly
i mean
we're gonna get absolutely destroyed by
a bat
and you know what i'm here to tell you
i'm here for it
one one bat ruins our life
oh this is beautiful no bats
no bats
that's still kind of nasty but
all right at least we got the oh
no
that's all right
that's all right
we lose this one
yes
we do still lose this dude we gotta we
gotta get out of here this is are we at
one one heart remaining
holy crap
this is a disaster
dude this rhino's got a scale
this is hell
um
all right so all we got to do is pop off
it's not that hard probably
we should have you at the back if you're
gonna get some advantage here okay
probably we don't need you um
rooster is what you do if you wanna
scale i don't really wanna scale i wanna
live so
that feels nice
and then roll
and then sell me
and then buy me
and then juice me and then squeeze me
and then sell me
and then buy me
and then sell me
and then
freeze me
and squeeze me a little freeze a little
squeeze a little cheeky scorpion to keep
you in the game little cheek oh he
should have frozen a pill too but a
little cheeky scorpion to keep in the
game no bats baby
well they expected this thing to die in
one hit and oh there is a bat i'm
actually just stupid
um
double melon armor
we draw
not good
freeze me
roll me
i need i need a rhinoceros please
i'm i'm going heavy for a rhinoceros
you peace
i'm like we can't even really peel the
turtle there's nothing to do with it
do we really like a scorpion at the
front though i don't know
a 1-1 scorpion it does so badly against
like deer and stuff like that i don't
know what dude i'm honestly like i think
believe it or not i think you sell
turtle by bat you sell the turtle you
buy a bat
because the bat can make the rhino
head to the freaking moon
you're a piece
weak unit at the front is not what you
want to see please weaken the peacock
oh it went right over his head i was so
excited
we take those we don't take those you
take this should call me in the morning
you peace
this is not a draw this is a loss
that's fine throw in a quick first off
pay out the doubters
i can't believe i've been sitting there
for four hours and 16 minutes we got one
win
start prediction will analgesic wins or
more
slash marker
play arena here we go we're back
fish stays
bird buffs fish this time pig is good
enough to hold
it's good enough to squeeze
we're not going to sell it this one
we'll sell the beef well yeah no we'll
sell the beaver on the next one this is
fine
unfreeze me
unfreeze me
end my turn
the crisp kilts
hasn't won all day i still believe um
excuse me
are you [ __ ] serious we got a 10
piece
early on this very string
you can dub scale
don't hit my birds you peace
oh
buy me
buy me
i hate that sound
don't freeze me
next turn is gonna be
sick when i get out there's gonna be
carnage in theaters now
big whoop
it's yet another draw
blue build is working though man you
ready it hasn't even started yet
now it begins
a chunka
tachanka
the earliest puppy you're ever gonna see
in your freaking life
we want so we can spend five gold which
is not a nice number
that means we can we can go pretty heavy
on rolls here
try to get something a little all
conducive to our success
like perhaps that for example we can
roll once more
honestly i think maybe you
i think you freeze nothing
oh
i like this so far 13 6 is a little
spooky
but are you even gonna
are you going to last long enough to hit
my puppy
yes you are this is going to be a draw
it's a draw but we scale
draws or wins when you scale
we still like it
i'm going a little heavy on rolls here
one more didn't even think about it
that's fine
that's fine we don't combine birds
yet give me one of those
oh 10 6 puppy
level 2 man
i don't know what to say
i guess they'll say what i often say
you peace
anyway we draw
and we scale
you obviously you're buying a puppy
that's just it's non-negotiable
i don't care for a ram
i do
like a tropical fish
do i like it enough
i think i probably do
i love your scaling though man like
let me do it like that
roll me
i'm gonna make a controversial decision
i'm gonna swan me
three three two one one him me that's a
that's a freezable scaling build
this is we have an engine
well we have a hulk
you're a piece
little melon armor this is going to be
tight we might lose to the b honestly in
fact we're going to lose before the b we
don't care though because a loss is a
win because we scale
two gold lamau okay this one's for you
ai trees twitch uh twitch uh prime user
if you have two or more gold game plus
two or plus two or plus two n plus two
at the end of your turn
so i guess you were just laughing
because you're so happy that we're
keeping two gold around so we could
scale so easily this is probably the
explanation that i would imagine
i treasy
la mao
i'm oh wait i'll wait okay i'll wait
all right
now
you're gonna come by me
three three two one
swan's gonna stick around for a bit
so we're gonna play this
then we're gonna play this
we can buy one more thing and that's it
we should make
our bird hit a little harder
i'm okay with that
you see i just love seeing all the buffs
it makes you feel like you're doing
something right
you peace
man
owl
we sleep
we still win this i think
yeah yeah definitely okay there we go
i'm surprised danielle hasn't banned
anyone today i'm having a great time i'm
i'm loving life man
it's turn seven you could sell a
tropical fish and run a caterpillar here
that'll scale very nicely with our puppy
is he lying chet i'm julie i'm not lying
i've been having a great day
weather's nice baby's cute what more
could you ask for
well a billion dollars okay sure thanks
five hours of super auto pets
very little complaining which is
you know honestly
pretty fair when you consider
you know what
the fact we played the same game for
literally the whole freaking stream
we could probably get rid of our birds
soon
i don't know if we replaced it with a
with a chick though i think we would
just chill for now maybe freeze
is this a good time to tell you i won't
be live on monday either because it's
canadian thanksgiving
but you know what that means i promise
you we won't play super auto pets on
monday
on stream
easy wins easy wins
has he gone for a break or stood up this
whole stream
no
i have i've eaten
80 of this corn dog though
i like where your head's at
what about a turtle
to override weakness on the dog maybe
yeah yeah yeah
take a five minute walk to
um
prevent blood clots
no i have one of those things you see on
the infomercials i'm pedaling every
stream
i basically i've i've run the tour de
france like eight times this year
already and i came in first
every time
get owned oh
baby
no shot
honestly can me
and then scan me
this is just a weird one
i don't want to buy anything that
cannibalizes our buffs
in that case i think we'll just keep the
cow out there we'll roll once or twice
to avoid cannibalizing
any buffs i don't even want those pears
man you peace
yeah yeah prefer to stay here dude this
caterpillar is getting mighty close
nice level one deer i think that's gonna
do a lot of good i'm not there's no need
to be rude i apologize
you are gonna lose though
i mean like look you don't even have
anybody on your team doing 30 damage
like what are you thinking my swan just
wiped you
my swan
it's not even out there for stats it's
out there for gold
what are you thinking
anyway scale me
anyway scale me
anyway sell me
and then freaking scale me dude
double caterpillar could have been sick
you're not wrong
but this is going to scale with our
level 2 poodle which is kind of crazy
now that's a sound
possible
possible play
i just feel bad man
what a what a shot
oh man we got a level six unit t-rex
already huh well my tier two dog just
smoked you no big deal hmm four wins
okay
we're not gonna roll a long-term swan
unless it's stats keep pogging i don't
know why that has like a
why does it match we're not going to
roll up all right
unless your stats keep pogging i mean we
could wait for like another caterpillar
or something you're still getting buffed
man
you know what well you're a tier three
you're a tier two
the buffs from the poodle are strange
now
i don't really want to sell a swan yet
i think i could sell a leopard and buy a
portal but then the leopard's getting
pogged up honestly unfreeze me and roll
me
i'm going a little deeper
you might as well
sweep
we're not gonna go for a level three
we're gonna sell it soon honestly you
don't need this you're already pogged so
like shut up
i think we want to buff the crap out of
you
he's already going to hit max stats so
i'm not sweating it at all
tier four
rooster
it's only gonna get plus two plus two i
don't think it works
i don't think it's worth it yet
i think you're gonna freeze me we got so
many lives to play with right now i
don't think rooster's the play i think
it's i think it's a little late for
i i don't think we have the scaling
engine to get rooster to pop
specifically
i'm unafraid
you peace
talk about value
you peace
we win easily again
can't wait for you to choke
you know i'm not the like running the
animals right
i'm doing the hard work like i'm the
animal's boss
um
so you should take this melon armor
can me
roll me
we're almost at the end of our scaling
adventure
if you give the caterpillar something
and it transforms it loses the buff
unfortunately
i gotta level with you
the problem with the dragon
is that we have no space to put our tier
ones when we buy them
so we have to sell the swan to get the
dragon then we have to sell something
vital
but if you sell the swan and you get a
rhino
i know it screwed us every time
but it'll become
just shut up for a second okay you sell
you get it i know
it's gonna get plus two plus two every
turn okay shut up shut up shut up
and it's also gonna have melon armor on
it
i don't care about the scaling this turn
i'm investing
i do care about this i don't care about
this
the puppy doesn't we don't need the econ
strats anymore the puppies already like
nearly max stats
what the heck is this it's a squad of of
four
okay you're a piece
you peace whatever we broke your armor
i'll settle for that
nice try
nice try
oh 1-1 versus 48-42 you beat me earlier
defiant
now they're all gonna pay
we have to try
again let's let's remember
we're really digging deep for these
animals here
another leopard
we don't care for economies
for the time being you might as no you
might as well not freeze that ever shut
up melon armor
no cupcake no no no no no
dude
semi-spicy team
except for that
let's go bat countered
level two blowfish sucks it's probably
gonna take our melon armor at some point
that's life man it don't matter
it don't matter at all
dude this is a possible 10 win
no doubt about it
it's certainly doable it's too late for
a double caterpillar but i admire your
enthusiasm
you need this
freeze me
well if i'd known that another one was
coming
then it would
no no uh so i'm just gonna be honest
with you okay i'm gonna eat this corn
dog
since that first octopus run
every time i've seen the octopus from
that point onwards it's been terrible
it's gone okay get over well there's a
little no that's just where it was fried
we don't need it the poodle is very
important for us to scale up all of our
units well really these three at this
point
the octopus i someone in chat said it
and i agree i believe that the octopus
is a false prophet right now
this is a spicy team
is that that
buffalo at the front is a little spooky
but
well it's very spooky but after we get
through that
i think the world becomes quite
oysteresque
it's actually not that bad at all
this is looking fantastic man
you need a little slice
no thank you
roll me
it's not as good ever ever i i love the
cow too okay
people think you buy the you sell the
poodle buy the cow give something plus
two plus two and then plus two plus two
terrible strategy this poodle's giving
plus two plus two to everything right
now except for the freaking caterpillar
which becomes a 50 48 anyway starting
next turn but a melon poodle
now we're talking okay
and then honestly
just buy me one just that's adjusting
case bye
i don't dislike the start here snipe
them
you
it's actually pretty good
i get that you're coming back
but guess what take one of those and
then i'm killing you and then take one
of these
nice scorpion
and then i'm killing you okay you're not
taking another one of those but that's
fine that went very well
nine wins baby
nine wins
one loss
really we're not fishing for much
we're only we're fishing for two poodles
or three rhinos
or three leopards
um so i'm like
honestly i'm kind of a believer in just
buying some some sushi
a little bit of it went to the dog but
that's okay
and then honestly like
it's a just in case
oh god the scorpion
you're lucky we still we got the chick
killed but
we have melon armors i don't know if the
scorpion no scorpion will not kill us
this we we don't lose i mean this this
is a win
it's that simple
oh 49 tough luck
just one shy but i can put myself in
their shoes 49 is probably good enough
only one level of max hp beats that well
and i'm spent
yeah i don't know if our dog ever
attacked in the entire game
that was a heck of a bill
the crisp kilts okay we're gonna pay out
the believers as we just did we're gonna
run the same prediction
hey team on 19 thanks for the gifted
subscriptions
one for each win
we're gonna keep it rolling here i'm
gonna do a five hour stream where i just
play this game the whole time uh
so i guess this is a great time to say
thanks for for sticking around i know
people enjoy it i'm glad people enjoy it
black truffler thank you as well
much appreciated
and uh
yeah thanks for being here so far

port to port
austin only sailors wait
not only sailors use condoms in the 90s
though they should the yeah they sail
from port to port
classic man
another classic bonmo
from austin powers himself
our economy game has gotten so much
better
unfortunately no we can roll a full
squad here
freeze me something semi-useful
this is also not bad man
do this is
this is good stuff
i we win this i don't even i just look
at the numbers mason although you do
have a b
um
we lose these we draw these
the numbers mason my favorite quote from
lost
whatever we scale
who cares as long as we scale who cares
sell me
squeeze me
febreze me
hey turtle the tim
thank you as well thank you
the gifted subscriptions thank you
you're not gonna love this part okay

sell
no
shrimp me
sell me
hedgehog me
i hate to give the head you know what no
it has to go there there's no other
options just accept that that's the role
that it was born to play and it's gonna
play it
and then
buff me
which buffs you buff me buff you
these stats are pretty spooky man
i don't like to see a level one blowfish
they're running a shrimp build too it's
going around you peace
whatever
you get pieced
get pieced
get pieced we drop
thoughts on netflix announcing at that
70s show spin-off
i don't really have thoughts
um but you know what's funny
has anyone else ever realized that 70s
show ran for more seasons than the real
70s did
you want to see something messed up man
oh you hit me him him me
oh that was fun oh no him him me him me
okay okay
oh man
what the [ __ ]
so we do have kind of like a food build
here also we can only roll three units
that's not great or four units i should
say however
swans kind of sick
dude pig plus shrimp is a little that's
a little dirty that's kind of a dirty
strategy
pay one gold to give a random friend to
hp
this is a nasty team hey i'm trash tell
me you're good without telling me you're
good
this is a loss
that's okay
because we're scaling man
what am i doing
i guess i'm buying
and then i'm selling
and then i'm
buying
and then i'm selling
and then i'm buying
and you know i'm selling
and then i'm buying it but i'm not
selling
instead i'm just going to eat some salad
i mean eat some salad
this is weird
i don't know about this one
yeah keep buffing that swan that's okay
this is a build we've never run before
which is just buy and sell things over
and over
okay i see a bat it doesn't matter too
much what it hits as long as it's not
the front so that's okay
that's okay
that's nasty
but that's okay
and that's okay dude this beetle is
freaking nasty look at this beetle man
hp you peace we're going to draw are you
piecing me
i thought for sure we won that
we're it's the wolf of wall street build
incoming
well this time you're gonna combine me
we're gonna roll
you're gonna buy me
you're a piece
we're gonna buy you

the robin hood build
when all the casinos closed down in 2020

market to get their dopamine hit

little a little any any any port in the
storm okay now i think i'm going to hold
you i'm going to hold you i'm going to
hold you
we're going to unfreeze you these pigs
are part of the day trading build
we get a deer out there just to live
12 21
garlic armor bluebird
what about the chick what about the
chick they're just lucky they haven't
been sold yet i buy and sell
tier 3 units at a level one 20 times a
day without even thinking about it
oops
hey i'll take a hey i'll take up the
biggest 72 ounce t-bone steak you got
your piece
that's me i'm mr moneybags here um

over and over again
this this
freaking shrimp has been running buck
wild man swan me
can me
buy me
don't be stupid
roll me
can me next turn
cammy next turn
oh man
what a build
you're not wrong some goats would be
insane
what is he doing we we we're running a
day trader build i wouldn't expect you
to understand mom
nice nice splash damage on your deer
sorry i didn't mean to be rude
well you really got me
i almost had to use my shrimp that time
i don't see how i couldn't okay
i don't see what kind of a person i
would be
if i didn't do that
the shrimp has been so good to us
in the face of such incredible insults
from chat
that i i don't know what kind of person
i would be if i didn't pay it forward
big whoop
is that a level two deer wow you're
almost a piece honestly not quite
thankfully
hey that's an interesting goat bag i'm
not even being facetious anymore it
actually kind of is an interesting goat
i wonder what you got going on with that
that's five wins oh man
oh baby
i'm just gonna be honest i know i could
buff you i'm kind of like you you know
what we could do we could peel ya
and then just buy another one
so you're kind of uh you're kind of an
econ build
i think i'm a t-rex boy here
the sauropod is better for money
i guess we'd probably be dumping this
soon
or now
now
sell me
chunk me
buy me
we need to keep three gold or more
so honestly
splash me
buy and sell beaver you peace you're a
genius
next pill we get this this mammoth is
not long for this world
that's a nasty rhino up at the front man
oh that weakness is pretty nasty too
honestly
you're gonna kill yup yup that's fair
not him though not him not him me him
this is a loss that bad that bad did
some scary work that's a loss
okay where are we at here five five wins
two losses
first loss in a bit i'm not gonna cry
about it or whatever
i would like to fish
i think it's a little late for the bison
but then again can i tell you something
i think the bird can go
pretty soon the shrimp actually probably
right now the shrimp can go
although it's done great work
it's really early to get a leopard out
there too but
it's 13 15 but
you know
hold on
level one bird there's never going to be
a more painless time to sell it
or a less painful time to sell it then
him me
him me
then
freeze me
roll me
stake
me we're not gonna be doing as much
buying or selling
as you've as you've seen before okay
roll me
roll me
shrimp me
freeze me
mammoth me
garlic me
pass my turn
there's some scaling being done here
the swan will go at some point soon too
i don't see
oh you peace
i was like i don't see any uh early
danger uh that changed pretty fast
okay we gotta we gotta make some bold
changes
we we had a huge peak in the mid game
and now it's all falling apart
little a for the octopus man my points
it's not octopus time we don't have i
mean it is 12 12. maybe it's octopus
time
i must think
we don't have to sell our swan this turn
okay
sell me
buy me this is a hail mary i'm not gonna
deny it
garlic you
keep this frozen keep this frozen roll
me
you're a piece
roll me again
you you gotta look at
a t-rex
you gotta look at a pill
you gotta say screw the scaling this
turn
no because you'd scale this guy so he
gets stronger next time
whatever you're not going to get any
you're not going to get any scaling
you're not going to you don't have any
scaling
then why are you not what are you doing
then what are you doing then what are
you like why are you doing this
you could sell a swan get to seven gold
and then buy two things and be in the
exact same spot it's not a good plan
give me a gorilla
and then a roll i i hate that we screwed
up the scaling this time
but it is what it is
1010 gorilla don't get one shot man
don't get one shot
well
it's not a whole i oh you level three
bat piece uh
this is bad for business
i can't believe it i can't believe it
we're paying out the doubters
you see the what a squad man
i was so convinced too
we won you gotta admit though
him him me him me him him me him me
wall street bets build
in the mid game that was doing some
serious work
you know i think it's probably like a
good lesson to be learned about day
trading
you can go on a real hot streak but
eventually you know the law of large
numbers
comes out with a big scythe and goes
anyway let me make sure my wife is good
to go
um
are you good to stream
smiley face
it's a fun experimental build i do i
have to admit i gotta use
the bathroom a little bit right now
donkey donkey donkey dunk the donkey
donkey donkey donkey donkey
that being said that was fun i had a
good time i hope you did as well
i can't wait with five hours the super
auto pets straight man



hey everybody welcome back it's super
auto pets and we're we're doing our best
that's all i can say you know what i
think is the best is when you see uh an
ants in your shop immediately followed
by another ant
and you could actually roll a beaver as
well
let me let me be the the the bumbling
bits
that describes my content pretty aptly
so one thing i've done in the past is
get a lot of ants which gives you a lot
of buffs you know run them wide instead
of running them long but another thing
that's kind of interesting
what a shot
i think that means we lose actually
because of the way the buffs shake out
here oh no we draw thank god um
you could also
create a level two ant quickly to get
another leveled up unit maybe
for now we could do this okay and i
think we can also do this
and then roll once we're looking for
something that combines
the the only thing is
when we combine them
we won't have the money to afford the
other unit okay so i think that what we
do is we say okay beetles are going to
stick around for a minute so let's buff
a beetle
oh
okay
for this turn no for life okay
interesting um
maybe roll it like that so we're gonna
have one pretty sick level two beetle
which we're then gonna use to get either
a level two or a level three unit i
don't know
great minds think alike as you can see
i and i'm not trying to um
you know sandbag i just look at this and
i say to myself this is quite the squad
that's not what you want to see
but we do draw okay i mean
i thought we were at a higher
probability of a loss there but
sometimes that's how like an auto chess
type game uh bears out right so the
first thing i want to do is
this right here which then did allow us
to get a tier three on the third turn
which seems
surprising
i think you can then roll tropical fish
which is
better than you would expect
i think you can
combine your ants i know this is not
like the meta play
then i think you can roll bird here
i think we're gonna freeze these two the
cricket's not long for this world but
now we got a nice we got a a six seven
beetle at the back we got some buffs
happening in the interim period i'm not
upset by the way this looks we got some
scaling
uh i i don't know how we're gonna punch
through that peacock
i guess we'll see
this does mean that we're we're trading
there you're gonna get me
i'm gonna get you
i'm gonna get you
i'm gonna get you and then we're gonna
win because of the rat
would you look at that
the rat is nasty man it's a four five
this is dangerous but
now forget the bat for the time being
let's let's peel this ant okay
eight eight
flamingo could be a 4-2 that when
fainting buffs the units
i think we buy one freeze the other
although to be honest with you we could
buy the other
seller cricket
roll a bat
does the bat need extra hp yeah probably
it's more likely to stick around roll me
once
freeze me this is exactly what we wanted
we now have a nine-nine level two beetle
now we're talking maybe
are we talking i don't know
i like the way this looks to start with
though
that's not the weakness you're looking
for i see where they were going up
against the 10 10.
that's freaking too too cricket man okay
so we lose this one
because of that 10 10 fish i mean that's
a nasty fish man
what can you say
we're at one in one no sweat one one was
scaling it could be a lot worse
so what do we like the most
we're definitely going to stick with a
bat for a bit so let's get the flamingo
back here
give me a quick buff
another bat is very important
i think
i love just having a turtle on the squad
and i think you can invest in making the
turtle a little better and i think you
can actually freeze the pill if you want
to to get some more melon armor out
there but that's about it now is this we
got to think about the way we want to
roll the squad here tropical fish
is buffing bad and bird
we really want the melon armor on the
beetle
you can you can do this for now
and then if we wanted to we could faint
the turtle give mel and armor to the
beetle right off the bat
and then move things back into the
position we prefer okay i see a bed i
see a little silhouette of a bat
weakness at the back is insanely good
for us because the turtle's just gonna
completely counter it
um but also like everything else about
this sucked really bad
i think we draw though which is
something actually we win no
we draw we're lucky to have the draw
quite frankly
what what a beetle at the back man
what a beetle at the back
um
so there is
melon armor
then
we can roll it like this again
but what are we going to put up at the
front
we don't know yet
puppy turns six you think it's a little
late for scaling i don't know i kind of
disagree right now let's roll me once
eight roll me roll me once more
spider is is always interesting
i mean i think for the time being you
can put a puppy in the shop
see if you're happy where you stand
if you are then roll one more time that
was bad um we we essentially got like
nothing out of this
but our puppy scaling has begun i don't
know it might be a little late but the
puppy did amazing work for us last time
the the thing we would love to see
changed is to make it like a two a level
two early if possible
we basically traded junk weaknesses
we're gonna draw again
barely
but yes
okay this is a draw build man but we do
scale again this is we're hoping to
crest at some point puppies please
no puppy
different tier animals we have a one we
have a three we have a three we have a
two wave of one you're a four
give a one one to different tier animals
so the bird in the beetle wouldn't
necessarily get buffed but you know what
i think we can sell a fish
roll a poodle
unfreeze the pill for now roll again
you're a tier three tier three we we
love that you're getting a double buff
here you're a tier four which means i
don't think you'd get a buff which means
i think
we roll
i'm basically ignoring scaling which i
would not recommend
you're a tier one what's getting dumped
first the beetle or the bird probably
the bird
so let's not invest in that bird right
now let's roll once
dog come on man come on
you're not the right animal
i it might seem insane given their stats
right now but i think the puppy's gonna
want garlic eventually
let's go
i'm giving it my all man i'm getting i'm
giving it a chance
2 3 versus a 4-3
pretty bad it's not a good start
that didn't matter thankfully
um this puppy's gonna have to do some
work man
i still i think we
i think we win no we draw cause of the
meat
but we draw with scaling that's my motto
okay we're one and one on round eight
so there's that um
i need to say it this is another roll
situation we need to upgrade the units
we got i i think we're a little late on
llama but i don't think we're late for
canned food we only have one loss
or a little late for buffalo i should
say turn eight you're a little late for
buffalo really you're a tier four i
don't love the tier four
i'm hoping to level up a unit we got you
know what
that's how we roll
let's let's invest in losing this time
in the hopes that we're gonna upgrade
our cans to like insane levels for the
future
this is not getting any easier let's be
honest weaken the scorpion please please
our dog has been weakened which is bad
because it was wearing garlic armor yeah
this this should be a loss
but we do have melon armor i don't know
we
actually
my word
we're gonna win which is kind of
disgusting
um but it is what it is that takes us to
2-1
honestly i think you can me we know
we're selling a bird soon to get
something better
it's not the amoeba but it that is funny
um you could
if you sold the bird for two three you
can get a swan at a nine ten
seven that takes us to four
i don't think the swan is the play but
let's freeze it for now
just in case it ends up being the play
and the swan is tier two two two we like
that our bats getting buffed we have a
tier three right the puppy yeah we don't
want the puppy to get compromised
you can roll one more time if you get
something you like you simply sell the
bird
you freeze this so you don't ruin your
buff this turn you unfreeze this
you know what you
do tier three
i would prefer if you didn't take the
buff we sell you
buy the owl
knowing that the owl
let's go
let's go knowing that the owl will give
us a buff when we sell next turn then
we'll start our next turn by leveling up
the bat which should give us a new tier
of animal that we can put in the shop
right now we're very lucky
that that was not lucky but
you know the prior to that there was
luck involved we lived through this
which is beautiful how we gonna beat
that puppy man
how we gonna beat that puppy i guess
we're gonna beat that puppy like this
and then are you are you kidding me
we're starting to build we're starting
to build a little bit three one
so there's some gimmies here
we upgrade you
dragon a tier by tier one animal give
all friends plus one plus one so this is
interesting the problem is we have to
find a way
and we're gonna sell this for sure we
have to find an extra space on the
roster
in order to fit tier one animals and
none exists right now
but that is crazy but then i'm also
looking at a rhino
and i'm like you know like a rhino
at 11 12.
tier 5 is going to get buffed plus a
chili splash attack to hit the weak
units at the back like
everything's getting buffed every single
turn here like the scaling is starting
to hit please don't kill my rhino right
away
this this is workable weakness on the
garlic rhino oh oh so close
that's all right we still get a kill
here
and the nice little splash attack
you're so lucky
[Laughter]
we still win which is surprising maybe
to some people not me because i knew we
had it that takes us to four
we're now at tier 6 animals
i mean you know you're going to freeze
that chocolate we know we're going to
try to scale up our rhinoceros
we don't have a tier 3 we're unlikely to
get one
the beetle is it served its purpose
hither to this point the puppy like if i
can get that puppy to level two man oh
okay freeze me
freeze me
squeeze me
good weakness and this rhino goes
infinite man i'm telling you
weakness on the front rhino
let's go that's huge
weakness on our bat
weakness on our beetle not great
sorry we still get a kill here which
means we get a kill here which means we
get a kill here and we're still winning
and we're still scaling
we're winning we're scaling him him me
him me him me me me
send him
send them
of battle
deal 50 attack damage to a random enemy
um
i really like this i think we can sell
our beetle
which is a tier one
and then roll our tier six leopard
instead this is a temporary downgrade
in search of of a future
big time upgrade
so it's gonna do six or seven damage to
a random enemy but it is a 1311 itself
we just need to give it some melon armor
we need weakness on the front peacock
please
i'll take it
saved we're it still sucks for a second
but at least we get through there which
allows us to then punch through here we
do die here
this is uh this is a loss okay i can
take that but we only we lost by one
unit
and i think that's to be expected now
that we've pivoted our scaling a bit i
mean i'm just going to level with you we
got a roll double rhino
um and i think i
misrepresented our rhino build i think
that the rhino should actually have
melon armor
i know this is gonna screw up the puppy
buff for one turn
but for them to get a kill
without dying we should have rolled one
more time too
if we're gonna be under the gold
threshold anyway no bad no okay bad
don't make me lose my melon armor
please
please
you peace
you you actual peace
we take
that's nasty
we do kill you
we don't kill you
we kill you
you kill us all right it's good
that we were not gonna make it through
that chicken to begin with either so
we're on our last life here
i know it might seem insane i i kind of
still think we're like
in an okay spot
i think the melon armor was a reasonable
investment
roll me
hit me
freeze me to get that puppy going now
just dude i'm telling you no bad or if
we hit a bad please at least just be a
level one because this rhino could
freaking it could roll me it's a level
three are you kidding me
it didn't hit our rhino
so there is that
but then we we dump your melon armor at
least and then we trade
then we trade
then we live
and we live and we win okay
so again
i'm okay with this whereas six wins
i think you should still keep trying to
build out the puppy if possible
i mean i feel like maybe mel and armor
on your cheetah could could get you out
of a jam here steaks are pretty good i
mean they're scaling on the t-rex don't
get me wrong
you think you could sell your cheetah
because you still hell i don't know
maybe the poodle's coming to the point
where we don't need it maybe you could
freeze two t-rex's get ready to sell the
poodle and instead run a t-rex which is
essentially just works well with the
puppy to begin with
confirm i could have rolled one more
time i guess but
please a draw or a win here i'm telling
just no bats man
no bats
i see no bats
replace all of their stuff please
replace all of their stuff we did
replace some stakes
thank you you get knocked out which
means we smack you you lose your melon
armor which means we get to hit you now
this is not great for us but that's okay
you're gonna lose your melon armor
the turtle's gonna die
you're gonna get some melon armor
and then we're gonna get you look at
that we win again
somehow still holding it together
yes win number seven
on a run that continues to scale i might
add
i'm investing very heavily in our
scaling so if we freeze at three this
would be nice don't get me wrong
three is where we stop three is all they
get please
please
this has ten win potential we just gotta
basically win out no bats no bats i see
no bats i do see a blowfish i see a 50
50 bison
we are gonna kill the blowfish
the rhino is not gonna get to pop
however the peacock's gonna go down
you're so lucky man you're so freaking
lucky oh you're so well i don't know how
we were gonna get through a 50 50 bison
at the better buffalo at the back to be
fair so fair enough fair enough i'll
settle for a seven win marty to open
things up today
that's not bad man
and then we'll then we'll run it back
here
now i love a 2-3 i i love a pig
basically
um because they sell nicely
i think we actually like the ant is more
likely to give us a win here okay
but i think
yeah i think you do it like this i think
you freeze the fish so you can maybe get
the level up
i'll be the silly pants that's that's a
phrase people say
the lazy chunks i'm a simple man
i see no ant and i know that we're not
gonna get an early loss here
the ant is just it basically creates an
unkillable unit you're not killing a 4-4
on turn one so i i don't count myself
you know good for that i count myself
lucky but i will take it
now roll me
i still like a bluebird
after everything we've been through i
still like a bluebird and you know what
i'm going to give you the ch i'm going
to give you a chance
i'm going to give you a chance to to
live by buying you some fruit rather
than just invest in some rerolls that
are probably not that good uh this looks
bad
maybe it's not that bad actually
yeah this it it's a
holy crap that was a level two and it's
a draw against joe mama 69
consider myself lucky on that one so the
way that you'd typically roll this
man it'd be so nice to get a fish so we
could get an early level three but you
like
how hard do you want to go right i think
this is how hard you want to go just
it didn't hit the unit i wanted but
that's okay we can roll the dromedary
temporarily
i definitely do like a flamingo
and then we can fish for one more roll
i don't see a good reason to not just
roll two dromedaries freeze another one
and then this guy is going to have so
much like statistically next turn he's
going to freaking dominate
we may lose this fight we would for turn
three we're a little underwhelming but
we have some scaling built for the
future
i know i'm i'm beating that scaling drum
pretty hard i don't see how we win this
i feel like you could maybe get a lucky
draw
that's
that's fine actually because we still
trade here
no i think this is like a guaranteed
loss
yeah yeah yeah i mean we didn't even
really get close but this was an
investment in our future plus he had
that cool fedora man what are you
supposed to do
so i have to think um
i think we go like this
and then
like this the bird is more likely to
stick around than the fish
than this
a puppy
we we are going to roll the puppy just
for the record
uh and i think we're going to make sure
i'm i'm willing to sack
a loss right now we'll roll once
i i know you're like it's the same squad
i'm willing to sack a loss just to make
sure this puppy gets started on the
ladder
the puppy is has been part of a lot of
great runs for us so i do not say no to
it
that doesn't matter too much i think
big plays
big plays
big plays
big plays we win okay that's that's good
we we won with a a 80 active squad
we got two bats which is crazy
um we definitely want a 4-6 bat out
there
thank you to our dromedary
the fish is going to get sold next by
the way but do you sell a fish to get a
peacock out there i don't think so
but in that case
we're not doing anything
you might as well roll
might as well freeze me
might as well freeze me you might as
well roll me
interesting
i think you can freeze the chick for now
i'm not i'm not sold that it's gonna
be part of the squad but it could be
part of the squad temporarily and if we
can get it to a level two quickly enough
i'd be pretty happy
but we're gonna get a high level unit
hey that's big we're gonna get a high
level unit pretty quickly
um because we're gonna get a level two
bat next turn which could create like uh
uh this is an unfortunate draw because
we were really close to a win here
um
we might get a tier four unit on this
turn
and we do have the double check here
look at this okay so you go you go bad
you get a tier four rooster
the rooster you sell the fish okay you
buy the rooster you don't focus just on
scaling the puppy for now
and then we're not gonna roll the chick
then we're gonna focus on buffing the
rooster
because it can it it's basically like
having a super b at the back why don't
we give you some garlic armor for future
considerations
puppy's still popping man puppy's still
getting plus two plus two every single
turn
as a level one
one one deer that's bad
because that means our bird will not get
a chance to attack
but we did honestly pretty well there
i think the weakness gave us a certain
benefit and would you look at that we're
gonna come out of this one
smelling like a rose we're at what three
wins one loss
you definitely want another rooster
that's a gimme
the dromedary is probably not long for
this world
as similar to the bird by the way so let
me just think about this for a second
because you could roll
um you could sell the dromedary
or sell the bird you let's just say
hypothetically you sell the dromedary
you go to nine gold
flamingo six
five gold
buy a level one dromedary
i don't know
um
all that just to downgrade a unit and
get a plus one plus one on everything
well i don't know i mean i i i think
it's a little late for that play to be
good
we probably do just as well making you
plus one plus one and getting you
possibly closer to
leveling up to a level three if that's
something we decide is valuable
we can roll once
i freeze you just in case unfreeze you
buy canned food
and freeze garlic the the frozen garlic
is still good i think we always want to
make sure we're buffing the puffy
the puppy
the lush bushes uh ruin this turtle's
life please please let's go that's
enormous well not really because now we
have a 16-19
dog we gotta find a way to punch through
um i mean this
this is a draw no the fish got us if if
we almost had it be a draw that's fine
so we're two losses three wins
yum yum yum which is good
in in a way
bluebird synergizes super nicely with
the rooster but i think it's time man
like the dromedary also does some great
work for us so let's get that out there
everything gets buffed
swan does work with puppy i'm not gonna
deny that okay
so i think for the time being
we could at least have those function
together
we don't have a level three friend at
some point we'll get one
but that point is not right now
unfortunately
i don't know i i feel like our scaling
is petered out a little bit but uh the
the rooster does really well when they
get upgraded
it seems like a good start for us
we don't quite get like a two-for-one or
whatever or the dog is gonna pop off
that's gonna be a little nasty
but i i don't know i look at the
situation i see our rooster and i'm not
too worried about it as long as our
puppy gets the kill on the dog even if
we die it doesn't matter because we
summoned an 11-1 at the end and we did
not die
so we're at four wins so we've already
we've broken even at worst this has been
a pretty good run for us lately you need
the rooster
now leopard is kind of tempting it
doesn't fit into our like scaling build
um
yet still
still that's there's some temptation
there or you could sell a swan
which admittedly is not long for this
world
okay so i do think you do that then toss
me a leopard in here freeze that that
chocolate there's no doubt about that
i don't mind putting a quick little
splash attack on our bat just in the
hopes that it does well as a result
we're we're scaling
attributionally but we're not we're
descaling like an orthodontist
um
please hit the front hit the front hit
the front with the weakness let's go
i don't care if the back is weak that's
not the end of the world um
we're descaling financially and that's
the that that's a problem but look at
this we're still cruising here like we
the puppy needs to be leveled up in
order to make them
you know worth using i think long term
but
rhino is very interesting as well maybe
instead of a leopard even though the
leopard
also has a chance to scale nicely but i
feel like a rhino could do some serious
work man
i'm gonna try it
roll me again
puppy is important in fact it's so
important
i'm really tempted to give you the
experience
yes i know if we still had a swan you
would be toasted right now i guess
there's no point in giving you the
experience on this one i feel like we
should freeze this for this guy as well
and instead we just roll for greatness
and i don't see greatness but that's
okay we'll freeze it here
the the chicken the rooster is not
scaling as fast as i would like here but
it is creating two twelve ones on death
okay so we're going to lose all of our
effects when you die
which is not great
but we did get to kill you which means
oh you get melon armor but we break your
melon armor
we hit you we hit you
we hit you we thankfully don't die to
this
which means we kill you which means we
win on the and that was a rematch feels
good man now we're pulling out of this
what are we at six wins okay
tier six animals online haven't we been
rolling tier six animals for like hours
uh you need to
roll this t-rex
and then we put this on the rhino we end
our turn everybody's getting buffed
everybody's getting scaled
everybody's getting juiced and
everybody's getting squeezed okay
i
i love
please weaken this this rhino weak in
this rhino
you are a a god amongst
amongst bats
big whoop
it's gonna be
it's gonna be interesting okay
i think we win
because we got yeah we just got numbers
no we draw okay fair enough i you you
had more hp than i didn't even look
because of the weakness i was like we're
just going to get you that's fine we
love it because we have scaling we don't
mind a draw
meow um garlic would probably work
nicely on something let's let's say on
our chicken for now
an extra life
on the on the rooster is kind of
interesting but it's going to come back
as a 1-1 so it's not that interesting
um i'm going to put melon armor on the
t-rex
we'll stay at the buff level
now the t-rex is like you know
you hope that they can live long enough
to get a kill
um this turtle is is horrible
still really bad
yeah yeah yeah okay at least we got rid
of your melon armor but
it's still really really bad at least
this will purge your melon armor
on on the unit that's behind you
and then we're gonna trade no we're not
gonna trade
but we are gonna
actually win thanks to our chickens is
mighty close but that is another seven
win marty in the books here you gotta
freeze this man
something having a steak it matters i
feel like our rhino is just getting
bodied by like status effects right now
i could be wrong for the record
roll me
roll me
freeze me
roll me
stall me
so we can actually get to a level three
rooster next turn and we don't have to
win this one or draw we have two we have
two lives to play with
for the love of god i just need to see
this this rhino do anything and that is
not how this is working out so far i
mean i don't see how we
win this fight
it's not happening
we were off by a lot this that you that
your squad deserves to do well you got a
very similar type build too not to
flatter myself unduly
we can't really buy anything
um and and keep our buffs going
but i mean the rhino has been so
i mean i'll just say it's been kind of
useless right
but all you got to do you know you go up
against the right squad everything falls
into place and maybe you're okay
like this could be big at the start here
if we weaken the front
that's big
it's not that big
hmm
you are a 43 oh no we're gonna make it
egg viewer
well hello
good game
in some ways
i'm i'm joking okay
now this rhino are we really going to
try to pivot to get an octopus to crack
it'll be in 1818 with no other buffs
attached to it
i guess you freeze it for now
and freeze it again
you might get lucky man like this is
worse than the rhino but the rhino
literally never had its ability pay off
anyway so i think that this had to be
done
and we're gonna need some luck okay
level three caterpillar means we got a
3434 coming up here
octopus does nothing of that we're aware
um
the weakness is is pretty nasty melon
armor is horrendous here
i feel like we still
oh no you peace
[Laughter]
we draw or sorry we lose is what i meant
a draw is a loss is a draw to me hey

an eight right that's pretty amazing for

hey everybody welcome back
super auto pets you know i i've been
playing a little
pay to win why don't you put me back on
the free to play for a bit i've been
playing a little bit this weekend too
i've been having a good time
um
you know when you play by the way first
off let me caffeinate
uh sip
secondly
i just want to say the community has
gotten good again
there was like when i started
i was around average level
then i had a
stream where i ascended the community
came up to meet me
then i kind of diminished then i had
like a little breakthrough over the past
maybe four or five days then this
weekend oh my god people are great again
but being on the free-to-play uh build
means you are destined
to run into a lot of horses
which is honestly fine okay
you can actually right you you want to
buy a horse first
that's a gimme
i definitely think we want a duck so
that we can sell it and make all of our
future animals better
you also get the buff on that you also
get the buff on this
and we want to keep the horse in the
middle because the horse is not doing
anything else so we want to make well
actually i think we want to keep the
horse at the front
even though they're probably going to
die we want to make sure the ant buffs
the
duck that seems sensible um
i think you can freeze another amp just
in case we should lose round one
let's be the upset astronauts there's
like there's almost an alliteration it
just sounds nice
i expect to lose round one
well we got it's a similar squad here so
we trade but then you buff
and then we trade and then you buff and
then we draw okay nothing wrong with
that the miffed legs what a name
what a name what a con thursday what a
concept
okay
now
you gotta you gotta think about this
okay i think this is a sell me
by me
because if we re-roll we lose the
benefit of the buy here
5-2 and
uh it to me it looks like this and we
want in imo we want the ants at the back
this is a maybe but probably a roll that
that annoys me but that's okay
um we got a full squad uh you know
technically the horses maybe should be
behind the cricket
so that they i mean obviously
[Laughter]
so that they get the buff on the one one
cricket that comes up but i'm also happy
my cricket will have a very good oh
frick
i still actually we we win don't we yeah
okay never mind i'm not saying we did it
perfectly but we did okay
those early wins they count just the
same as the late game wins so i'm i'm a
happy man there
um
i do think if we're gonna roll a a horse
build we want to combine our ants
throw in a spider
like so
we probably we have to think we probably
want to combine our horses but we are
getting double buffs out of them right
now
i mean i'm kinda and this might surprise
you
i think you roll like cool horse at the
back
the coolest horse is the horse with the
most stats
and then
like this
and then i think we just buy out for the
time being knowing
the cricket will probably last a little
bit the spiders are going to last longer
than anybody i think so let's let's go
like this
so you're actually i'm going to invest
in in making our current squad better um
in the hopes that like we're not going
to spend money on rerolls i like the
squad that we got going on here i like
our stats we'll try to get a level two
horse next turn which would go a long
way for us i see this is a little
dangerous okay a uh a five five
swan is tough to deal with
okay
you kill my spider which is not great
news
then you kill my giraffe you you create
a cool b but luckily we defeat the bee
this is a draw
this is a win
i'm stunned okay
our horse build beats their horse build
so far so good
two wins and we haven't even really
begun to peak yet which is kind of nice
let's make sure we're caffeinating
a duck doesn't interest me that much
right now it's i love it in the early
game
we're really fishing for something
what one thing you can do
is kill this ants
i'm okay with the buff believe it or not
then we gotta think
is this really the time to roll like a
peacock the answer is no i in my opinion
um
i think we can roll
i do like a dodo
i think we can afford to buy it it gets
a sick buff on this turn
and then i mean i think you freeze a
beehive roll me once
i i don't love anything that we got
going on here more or less
[Laughter]
unfortunately um
and then to be honest with you i think
we prefer like this
let's see
uh i don't want to roll two horses any
longer i want to i want to pivot out of
our
horse build into like stronger units so
maybe we should have actually
prioritized um
maybe we should have prioritized like
the peacock but i don't know i'm okay
with it for now
you know we we do okay here you're
giving mel and armor that's a given we
create a b the b's gonna trade with the
flamingo the ant's gonna get uh one shot
despite the stat upgrade we're gonna get
a
four two we're gonna we're gonna
actually win again
somehow we we bought ourselves a lot of
space with with these dubs early on here
so i'm not disappointed in that
but we gotta we gotta figure out what
the heck we're doing here you can
definitely it sucks to lose the double
buff okay but we need to start doing
something
um
you can definitely roll
like this and then an ox
i feel like behind the spider
i don't really love a garlic yet why
don't you give me a roll i'll take
another spider for now
and a sheep is is an amazing hit here
right like
i actually feel like you probably sell
the dodo
it's it no longer has its cool buff
and then you run sheep
in front of the ox instead
me i don't think you need to freeze a
pill just roll me
a dog is kind of like it's an important
part of this build i actually think it's
a little late to try to get the dog
build to run i think instead we're
trying to get to like level five and six
units maybe that can define our run
quickly because our spam build is gonna
run out of utility pretty soon
that's nasty
it's known nastiness your melon armor
was was perfect oh or was it perfectly
executed because now we're gonna get you
which is fine
we we do want a level two horse for the
time being though there's a little melon
armor for me and a little buff excuse me
where's where's my my buff and melon
armor
we ain't sweating it i i'm stunned kind
of that we're out here what is this like
four wins
four wins zero losses
i i feel like this build is not that
good and i'm not just trying to flex
but here we are okay so this is big i
think
you definitely want the spider to level
up to see what you get i'm not thrilled
with what we got
but that's okay i think you can sell
the cricket
to start running a whale
the problem is you got to figure out
where to place this son of a gun
i think
cause like okay well we know we're
selling you
then like a whale eating a spider is not
so bad
because it gets a nice buff here the
only problem is that it will lose the
meat which is a pretty big element of
this right now
or
we could try running something like this
and the downside of it
is that
we're only gonna summon one ram but no
matter as long as we have five units no
matter where we put you you're always
gonna only summon one ram on the whale
swallow
so i'm not thrilled
i think this is this is a thinker if you
will
freeze one cupcake just in case roll me
once i think this is a snail freeze
situation and honestly why don't you go
ahead and
buy me this uh cupcake because again i
think i misrepresent or i misunderstood
the cupcake for a long time i was like
why would i pay for temporary stats well
because winning is permanent how about
that
so i'm not scared of too much here
i don't mind this that the math on that
is unfortunate
that blowfish is going to be a little
spooky however
we have exact oh
no
because you're going to hit several
times
[Laughter]
not the horse
i can live with that you were going to
die anyway what are you thinking like
there's no way you're going to pull
through this 11 8 i think
except for when you do
and then we draw
that's amazing to me but it's also a
great indicator that we're getting past
the point where like the scaling is
working for us we got to start
rethinking how this is going to go down
so a uh a rooster is an amazing unit if
we can level it up and get it buffed
are we willing to get i mean the ox did
a lot of work but this is the thing do
you want to get sunk in the quicksand
because this is how you get sunk in the
quicksand what what do i mean by this
statement well
um
if we stick with this build we're going
to hit diminishing returns really soon
so i think that we're getting to the
point where we can start to try to build
something better
i think we're probably going to suffer
some losses temporarily so if you'll
excuse me for a second here i think
we're gonna sell our horse and start
pivoting this whole freaking build we're
gonna buy a rooster
we're gonna buff the rooster
we don't need to well honestly i'm like
maybe we maybe it's not the worst thing
in the world to freeze two snails the
rooster is getting buffed
because the buff no not gonna happen the
buff benefits us but is also
the most likely
that's probably better right
yeah that seems better your stats will
still be seven seven i think um
the it it's the most likely to benefit
us long term and its stats also give us
a bonus in the in the time that it's
being used in the first place okay so we
got a very similar build here but you
got great scaling from the monkeys your
kangaroo scares the crap out of me i
would describe myself as uh
as moderately frightened for certain i
think that kangaroo is gonna is gonna
pop off man excuse me why do i have a 3
3 chick there instead
yeah this seems this seems bad
i see your spam here and i respect it i
would like to steal it for myself okay
there's no way we're punching through
this kangaroo just embrace it even if we
do which we can't we're not gonna get
through the monkeys
you know what we're actually gonna draw
i we
our team was so much worse but the ox
having just exactly the right stats what
a world we live in
um
okay i mean i do think you can even
though it doesn't specifically help us
right now i still think you keep one
snail around just in case i recognize
the problems with this i genuinely do so
we actually don't like this anymore this
is no longer it doesn't appeal to me so
i guess we'll just have you eat the
sheep
maybe roll that instead and uh
just thinking
just i'm i'm thinking um
spy no you know i'd i would rather not
buy salad
i would
i'm gonna buy salad please hit my
chicken
you're a piece our ox might stick around
that's what i was worried about like the
chicken is the only unit i really care
about here
it's the light of my life this is and i
know i said this before and been wrong
this definitely looks like a loss
all of these units have good stats
that's unfortunate for me
but
oh no the rhino the rhino has a combo
and then it smacks me
and then it smacks me
and then it smacks me
and then it smacks me
[Laughter]
and then
it smacks me
and then i get a buff but it's not
enough that dude andrew dinkum what a
squad that's that's a nasty squad there
with the sun hat deals us our first loss
i'm content to say that that's long
overdue honestly
the the parrot can be very interesting
what do we not want on this squad
honestly the whale is getting pretty
close to being actually the sheep is
largely useless
selmy
are we going to roll a parrot
copy's the level one so on on death
you could summon another parrot or you
could get the effect of the ox benefit
or you could summon a little creature
i'm not sold on the parrot okay what i
am sold on is is a cow is nice
and we already know that the cow is
gonna feed the chicken
then we're gonna free no
end turn give the friend ahead plus one
plus one
and turn is like the scaling in battle
or outside of battle here
i feel like
what
um
i feel like one of the big parts of our
um ability to succeed here
is honestly
getting like a level two chicken
a rhino is very interesting as well
don't get me wrong
anthony you definitely want a snail out
here
just because of the the buff it gives is
out of control
and i guess you know people are gonna
look at this and be like what's wrong
with you
i think we gotta
we gotta get some benefit out of this
[Laughter]
this our spider is not good
like when it i look just send it this i
i predict a loss okay but i think our
chicken allows us to start dreaming of
future wins
at least it's only a level one turtle
this is a nasty squad kangaroos nasty
nasty squad man
six four
we beat you that's fine your melon armor
i i understand the way that this is
gonna go
this is why we really want to see oh you
peace
this is why we really want to see a
level two chicken
oh no it's my white weenie build i think
we win this honestly or we come very
close
um because like our chicken is just
really strong
and if as long as we kill you even if
you kill me we're making it yeah all
right well this actually went really
well
but imagine if we had two
level or 22-1 chicks that came out
afterwards
okay well we don't care about uh a snail
leveling up a hippo that gets cracked
can get a little nasty so let's start
here
leopard is an interesting one too
hippo has that it has that scaling
potential though one thing's for sure we
don't care about our whale in the
slightest
so i do think that maybe
we're on round 10 i'm a little scared of
the hippo being a little late to the
party
um
i you know what i feel like we can roll
a leopard here
makes a nice sound when it comes out too
and then the chili pepper can be can be
pretty good
we'd rather have like melon armor on you
though i think um
we unfreeze that that's my bad we're not
gonna invest in our spider
the rhino also it appeals to me
mightily
i think we can freeze the rhino for the
future we're looking to level up the
leopard for sure and the leopard also
benefits from a buff here so oh by the
way probably should get rid of our snail
at some point my mistake
probably probably a little bit more
valuable uh to keep a whale than a snail
but
alas
what's done is done i see what you're
doing here but i kind of oh you have a
level two chicken okay
is this this interesting
that's an interesting thing we got there
i still feel okay
it's a nice hit we knew this was coming
the melon armors is a piece for sure but
dude this ox is going to be a he's going
to be a force to be reckoned with
we're going to summon our own yeah two
chicks you're done
this is the rooster is doing some
serious work this is six wins
on a build that i was not feeling great
about to be honest
do we roll a rhino
in front
in the hopes that it can just
it really screws up a white weeny build
we can sell the snail
we can roll a rhino it it basically has
to be in front we're keeping this frozen
because it's like the most valuable
piece of the puzzle tiger is disgusting
um
there's like there's no wrong answer
[Laughter]
i feel like you can sell your spider and
then roll a tiger behind a rooster at
like the very back
in which case
when the rooster dies it will summon
four chicks
with the same
attack i think
so the spider was not gonna be part of
the squad much longer anyway
why don't you give me a tiger at the
very back chicken right here the ox now
has no purpose just to be honest with
you
so i think maybe the benefit there is
you sell the ox
buy a leopard
roll me knowing that this gets us there
next time
i wish that this was not honey but you
know
um
we should spend our money if we're gonna
do something we should spend our money
so we might as well get you closer to
leveling up i guess again this is not
ideal but this is our our necessary
pivot from from like surprising early
and mid-game superstar to hopefully like
having the potential to go wild this is
a loss if you run into turkey fly you
just give up basically unless the rhino
can go freaking wild which it will not
obviously
this yeah this is a disaster especially
considering it's a level two turkey
[Laughter]
the only thing i'm hoping for is maybe
the the four roosters oh my god i was so
wrong i apologize we actually easily won
and uh i now sound like i was
sandbagging the whole time
wasn't my intention
so this is a combine
we didn't have space in the shop which
was my bad we should have set that up
freeze me
buy me
buff me buff me this i'm okay i know
that the chicken gets the benefit too
because the leopard is is quite nice
also the leopard works well with the
tiger but i'm not gonna mix it up too
much right now we're gonna we're just
gonna buy you
maybe i guess we don't sell you yet
we're looking for something
a snake is kind of disgusting
um especially if you can get a snake
behind something that lives for a while
like
that's kind of insane
uh
so like behind the rooster perhaps but i
i don't know i like what we got here
i think
look i for the time being i do think you
sell cow
you might as well buy snake
and put it behind leopard and hope for
the best
roll me once give me another leopard
a steak on our rooster or sorry on our
hippo um is also great maybe melon armor
on our rooster in the future then
we're at seven wins one loss
i'm starting to believe we can get there
but i'm i'm holding my breath a little
bit this is horrible obviously
it's disastrous
that's even worse
[Laughter]
and i i like your snake build here great
minds think alike
good good shot one good turn deserves
another i suppose
now we only summoned two chicks
unfortunately if we'd summoned three by
or four by having a tiger we actually
would have won but our our tiger getting
iced by the uh
the dolphin was it i mean that was just
a it was a move of pure genius what can
you say
try
it try it
i still believe in this i i understand
what killed us last time this is where
you just go like oh what are the odds of
the exact same thing happens again
hopefully somewhat low and then roll it
because this is where it could all come
crashing down
seven wins one loss is great seven wins
three losses little less so
uh so we do four damage to you until
unless maybe we got so lucky we busted
your melon armor open
that that throws a monkey wrench into
your whole plan i'm sure
because this is a huge play mel and
armor just going wild man okay not bad
not bad and then we got you know 12
roosters at the back just in case
i still feel like the snake can pop
now turtle
is very interesting
i don't think it's the squad we want but
it's an interesting idea
we're kind of just fishing for what
we're looking for here
i mean honestly
i think you just buy a one-up for the
the tiger
then if oh maybe
maybe
sure yeah yeah this is fine then if it
gets sniped again at least it comes back
because we don't care about his stats
it's all about its ability so we we beat
dolphin now i think
it's a nasty squad of course
you don't really care
to get a scorpion um
hurt but not killed but look at this
you peace
doesn't matter
we brought back the tiger the splash
damage won it okay look at that or that
didn't win it i should say
um
so we're at nine wins
kind of crazy right
take a little buff on me please
take a little buff on me
freeze me
roll me
take a little buff on me
i think there there's a chance nine wins
is good
it's great i don't want to set the
expectations badly
i see your fly build and it's it scares
me it does
um
i also feel like our snake
does pretty well versus a fly build
it at least landed two extra shots then
you're gonna do some the splash damage
is really bad
what the
like the splash damage is is really bad
for my uh
for my overall builds here but that's
why you keep
the tiger around
now we get four 24 twos
you're gonna get buffed to high heaven
i i don't think we win though
i think we lose
but it was so close
we that was a fight for the ages right
there i want to say by the way
just to be able to compete
with the turkey uh fly build is
exceptional
that is a huge surprise in and of itself
um
so believe it or not i know you're gonna
be like come on man
but believe it or not you actually have
no real reason
uh to
level up the rooster
it gets stats but we can't summon
six chicks we could summon three
and then have our tiger
make the snake
do better
you know
you know i this is probably like if it
ain't broke don't fix it
but i think
i think you got a point
this would only summon two at the back
but you would
hit every time you attacked you would
hit for 10 twice i'm not i'm not willing
to do it what i am willing to do is get
you to the next level regardless i think
that's important
and then basically freeze and just we're
rolling for something that looks like
the dream
um
because this is it all comes down to
this i think probably the dream as much
as it might surprise you is just maybe
like melon armor on snake
if it lands one more attack maybe we
turn a loss into a draw
okay very similar squad here level two
dodo is very spicy you got a similar
sort of chicken set up here
i understand you got a five five bus
melon armor has helped me out a little
bit
that's that it purges some melon armor
can't be mad
that's it it did half damage can't be
mad
that sucks
[Laughter]
there we go we're still alive okay i
know you're you're summoning a bunch of
uh
pieces of garbage it is what it is
you peace so we lose this
we it's a nine win marty but you know
what
that's not so bad in the whole scheme of
things that's not so bad
i'm just we faded a little bit at the
end but i mean when you run into turkeys
what do you expect
thanksgiving happy thanksgiving
everybody um in canada at least for now
thanks for watching hope you've enjoyed
it if you did click like button also
great deal of course subscribe you want
to see more in the future for now thanks
for watching i'll see you next time see
ya



hey everybody welcome back you can't be
mad about a nine piece win we're gonna
run free to play again because i
accidentally started uh the game without
changing to the pay to win deck
it happens we don't we don't care for a
cricket this is a this is a roll me
please hit my fish
you peace
still i mean
don't combine them that would be
disastrous this is still like a three
four fish is dangerous to to deal with
early on here will be the gasping mouths
i mean it just makes perfect sense right
the wavy rangers an ant always scares
the crap out of me
don't buff yeah okay by not buffing the
cricket i think we've turned this into a
draw
if the but well we might have still
drawn early draws are pretty common like
you know everybody kind of knows i think
what they're looking for early on here
a duck benefits us in the future an ant
really like an ant wins matches early
um
so i think
the way to play this
is you freeze i know it looks goofy
because the otter is not an incredible
choice but it gives us
the ability
to easily yeah and the answer yeah okay
you know what i respect this it gives us
the ability to easily um get to a tier
three unit early and that can win you
like two rounds by itself
very great minds think alike i've
noticed uh
sorry our first two units traded with
their first two units this will be we
please hit the fish okay thanks for your
help you're gonna hit the fish
you're gonna be i think this is a draw
then
if we were at 50 50 away from that being
a win and we're rolling like an otter
squad right now so i'm not i'm not too
upset
so we start here
dude an ox is kind of sick um
i'm just like if i go bump bump
yeah let's do it
what uh freeze me
keep me
i like this
not so much that will probably freeze
you as well we're gonna freeze you
you're gonna work super well with an ox
i don't think we want like a double ox
build or whatever but
yeah this is okay
i don't i don't love the way this is set
up we probably should have sold the duck
instead of uh re-rolling twice yeah okay
brain's not where it needs to be here
well the fishy fingers in keeping with
their name this is a beautiful otter for
us that just did some incredible work
and now we we punch through you with
melon armor which is lovely
we definitely win this one in spite of
my my disrespect towards the duck
a 7 6 fish at the back is hard to crack
early late late game it's kind of a joke
but um
so i would say
this is a sell me
by me
combine me
spider
up at the front is gonna benefit this
aux the most
roll me
i think that this is a
pill me and hope it hits the ox
this is a pretty spicy spider up at the
front man and then i think you roll a
dodo and we're looking to buff that dodo
in the future unfreeze this pill the the
fish is next to go
this is a squad that can win us some
rounds
just via the ox
4 8 is nasty obviously but
we do pretty much i mean we literally
trade with you which is good because we
actually have a spider that comes out
afterwards it gives us an ox buff so
it's better than a trade
i'm not worried about this one this one
looks pretty good
actually it's going to be a draw
but that's okay unless you had a b thank
god no b that's okay i i like this i
like where we're at
we sell
being honest
i love this play
you want an ox buff you want a dodo buff
for obvious reasons if it's not oh and
he starts with melon armor
[Laughter]
forever now or just for this one time
probably just for this one time but it's
that's funny either way
but dude i i mean i gotta like level
with you or whatever an early deer is
kind of disgusting
the dodo is also very nice um
i mean i think you still roll the deer
up at the front we only i looking at
this build right now i'm like we only
lose to like chili pepper
and i don't think you're gonna see too
many of those on like game four or
whatever we're on this is gonna destroy
your your ants which is nice for me
and then it's gonna destroy
your flaming oh no it's gonna destroy
your your rabbit and your beat that's
okay
little buff no sweat
this is
i don't know what to say man this is
great
this ox can be with us for a while the
next thing to leave will be the beaver
it's like he knew so you we had killing
the flamingo in front of you actually
did give you like permanent melon armor
that's kind of crazy
like that's that's incredible
level two dodo is pretty sick i don't
see anything here i love
something i might love is you know this
is a we get a double benefit out of that
and to be honest with you
it's a little bit of a it's a a bit
cheesy right to just invest in these
wins but
three gold is kind of an awkward number
you kind of got to make a choice right
away
now this looks bad they they have i
wouldn't i don't know if i call it a
meta squad or whatever but
you know we got a pretty
similar setup only i think that theirs
is
probably a little bit smarter
but we do have a 22 8 ox
that's gonna live through the bus
it's not gonna live through the peacock
but we're gonna draw
that's pretty okay all things considered
we're only at two wins but this is this
is a squad that can go deeper
don't get tricked
i don't think this is a peacock build
i think you can roll i think honestly if
we're keeping this for a minute you can
take one of those
now kangaroo
actually is a perfect addition behind
our insanely tanky ox
now it screws up the dodo
frees me for a sec
freeze me for a sec
the freeze for me at this point is like
basically
i don't want to think about it
[Laughter]
so it does screw up our dodo but our
dodo is one dodo or one chocolate bar
away from
being able to hit that ox as well
i like that we got a weird
deck going on here man they have a level
three horse which means i mean the best
time to fight this squad as well that
bison is still only a 1010 thankfully
that badger is gonna be it's gonna be
something let's put it that way
it's really gonna hurt their whale but
it did kill my bus
they create a spider it's a 5 2 spider
spider has been killed
comes a 5 2 snail
it's fine we create a camel that does
nothing if we're being honest but this
is where it really shines dude that
bison is here so early though that's
going to be that's going to be very bad
for teams that play daha 8901 later
but our squad is is kind of cruising huh
i still don't like
not buying a can is like
let me put it this way it's nobody's
favorite play
but i think we're doing
a sensible thing
by looking for the exact stuff that we
want in the future and really like one
dodo is is the biggest force multiplier
we can ask for right now
two four i see a level one turtle and i
i get the danger i'm not that perturbed
but that rhino what the backs got me
it's got me tripping up a little bit
okay as long as oh you're so freaking
lucky the bus
doesn't kill you
but then it's gonna
okay
i mean you're gonna kill my spider
oh you're a you're a very shrewd
individual aren't you
aren't you
hold on though that's fine we don't
really care for the two two this this is
where things get interesting
melon armor is is top tier obviously
your rhino uh being killed before it can
kill us is insanely important and then
our kangaroo beats your dodo and we're
off to the races we built our own little
strange squad that's doing great work
so the monkey is is very very very nice
for scaling
but what do you want to scale
our spot even though our spider's eight
six it doesn't have to be here anymore
the thing is though like if you're gonna
roll a monkey you kind of need to dump a
deer
because where are you gonna put this
deer in the rotation right
so we we can't put an ox at the front we
need we need a frontline unit and i
don't think it's a rooster
this is a weird transition period but i
i believe it okay
i believe that
is going to be a touch goofy for a bit
here
if we buff the spider we buff the spider
that oh
mama
let me think
so we have a good thing going um
but a turkey is like
i think a turkey is worth the pivot
straight up so i think i hate to say it
goodbye kangaroo
i don't expect
that's a must get
probably this matters
probably that matters
i don't expect necessarily to to crush
on this
wave i we might have a couple of turns
of getting ourselves set up uh for for
future prospects but
don't hit the melon armor you are you
peace
oh no
oh it's okay hold on you get the melon
armor back let's go
let's go
[Laughter]
the the turkey and shark combo is gonna
okay you've taken my melon armor again
but guess what i got some more melon
armor
you're i mean a level three horse is
pretty dangerous but at least we were
punching through man this is no sweat
the the turkey horse or sorry turkey uh
shark fly combination like it's it's
worth the pivot especially if we're
winning while we're pivoting
um
so i think you still
still start
maybe with this
uh
the ox has done great work for us i
think it's time for the dodo to say
goodbye
you're going to go here we still want to
roll a spider obviously we're going to
want one more turkey the thing that we
could do
is uh
i mean maybe the monkey's not too long
for this world anymore but i think we'll
just put you up here for now
a dog is a little late in my opinion um
a deer though can be pretty amazing i
guess now because we're gonna dump the
spider even though the spider fits us
we're gonna dump the monkey we're gonna
dump the ox we just have to think about
what we're bringing out instead a horse
i think it's too late for the i mean the
shark is basically just a better dog and
the turkey's just a better horse so
again we're still in this transition
period but i'm i'm definitely a believer
in in how this could work for us like
that's an amazing start okay
then we do lose melon armor but then
guess what we gain melon armor
and you're getting buffed you're getting
buffed you're getting buffed we purge
your melon armor we're getting buffed
you don't have melon armor you're
getting buffed you're dead
you're dead you're gonna kill our monkey
though which is that's nasty this is a
loss actually
never mind i'm totally wrong we won and
now i apologize for my actions
nothing wrong with that
hold on i just had to text my parents
there they said should we dress up for
thanksgiving
it's not that kind of party mom don't
worry about it okay i mean this is what
i'm wearing at thanksgiving so um so the
monkey's gotta go it it's been doing
good work and the spiders gotta go the
monkey is don't get me wrong the scaling
is incredible we got to lean into the
build okay
the spider gets sold replaced with the
deer
the deer gets an awesome buff to start
with but is also going to give tons of
buffs to our ox so it's like just a
better situation there
um
you totally could
roll the chicken out here in place of
that monkey for now
and then think about where we take it in
the future i mean to be honest i do kind
of want to sell the ox
but as long as the ox is still pumping
i'm like maybe
maybe it's not necessary you know i
think some garlic on our shark will do
wonders for us a pear is pretty good too
but
so we're at six wings no losses
i love seeing an 86 right off the bat
we like it you get a a heck of a buff
here you get a buff you get a buff
everybody gets a buff that's fine
that's free locate level two oh don't
shoot okay that's fine uh level level
two turtle is is deadly for sure that's
very dangerous but i still think we're
we're getting ya i don't see how we
wouldn't be getting you here
that doesn't really help too much but
maybe it does actually i don't know too
well we still make it
i mean this has the potential to be a
perfect build
i'm not saying
that it's a hundred percent locked in
but it's it's really quite nice
[Laughter]
i think you roll
and you're really looking for the things
you already got right
so the shark i i think the turkey is a
little bit more valuable than the shark
but
i could be wrong about that
um
if we get flies definitely i think we'll
prefer that
and if we only have three gold left
let's just uh
probably throw in like a a cupcake maybe
on the ox let's see if it can live a
little longer it's it's turned 12.
i think we got a pretty strong squad for
turn 12.
maybe not that strong
that's pretty nasty but i will say i
feel like
if we punch through oh that snake's
gonna do us like that's gonna be
terrible man um i feel like if we're if
we're able to punch through the peacock
the rest of the squad could fall apart
we get a kill thankfully
the turkey dying is pretty bad but the
shark
i don't think it's gonna do it
[Laughter]
but it might
oh my god i think it's just gonna get to
a draw
i'll take it man that's that's uh that's
lucky for me i think
maintain that semi-perfect record
again like i don't know if the ox is the
right play right now but it it is
getting heavily buffed it's hard to say
no to that
steak on the deer i think works nice and
we might as well buy a salad at that
point onwards rather than just investing
in rerolls that might not work so the
next thing we want and and
we'd either we'd probably sell the
rooster for this
because our ox is pretty sick this is
another
pretty nasty squad here
obviously at least
at least there's no uh snake sniping our
back line here
and you know what that peacock's going
down man this ox is
he's proven his weight
worth his weight in gold here
this is nasty our our
shark oh my god is
not gonna live which means we're gonna
lose but barely there goes the perfect
but but life goes on
i'm still a believer
very much so
i
i mean i hate to
maybe i don't hate to you know what
maybe i don't hate to and then we freeze
and then we sell
and then we fly
might as well put you there
a 1010 fly huh and then we roll
and then we chill
you may want shark at the very back
instead of the middle oh my god a 42-45
don't kill my turkey
oh oh please please no it's just a
splash for five it's not a splat
you don't kill my turkey you okay the
fly still lives
there is another a two-two fly comes out
that then gets
buffed to it oh you piece
oh that's i mean this is like the
perfect counter build to what we got
going on unfortunately
now our ox is going to die on the hit
which is really bad
then the shark is going to kill you
you peace
this one was close i i'm not mad like
we're in there
little reworking the order slightly and
hopefully like not getting sniped on our
back line
i think that's a little bit better
even though it it admittedly looks a
little goofy in and of itself
and i think we're pretty i mean maybe we
put a steak on you roll you once and
then we're like we know that the squad's
looking pretty nasty but
i the ox probably still benefits the
most from the buff in my opinion
i think maybe we just have like one i'm
i have so way too much commitment to
this ox
when i also i see that you have a double
dodo here oh no
[Laughter]
maybe a little bit too much commitment
to this ox
maybe more than a little too much coming
into the ox
yes okay
fair enough nice buff
yeah go ahead purge my melon armor right
we would die anyway like because the 50
would destroy us but
okay at least at least
we still get to attack with our turkey
which has a stake attached to it
i mean this is uh
this could be
it could be a win it is a it is a draw
by one hp
i'm still a believer okay
i don't necessarily believe in the melon
armor now
maybe we freeze one on the fly just so
it's
slightly less likely to get
well we might as well roll here because
everyone else is kind of tapped on
the advantages
this is a big freeze
roll me
i just want to see a turkey please wait
i guess we could freeze a deer i don't
know we're kind of we're we're only at
seven wins
i thought we were doing better than that
we're kind of hitting a wall here
what if we sold the ox and created like
a similar enabler you know
i think we have the same squad but
stronger here
um
levels are pretty similar
roster is pretty similar but i feel like
that cricket and the ram
i understand them but i feel like it's a
bit of a weak point as compared to our
fly
obviously this is going to get buffed to
the extreme
we do well there
thank you melon armor we do well here
we don't do so well here
this is where it starts to it starts to
fall apart
uh yeah actually i've increasingly come
to the realization i think we're gonna
lose here that's a big hit though but
then you summon two four four rams out
of that holy crap man
i'm i'm coming to the realization
we have to kill
our own ox
and i i gained no pleasure in that
holy crap
i thought we had oh you had melon
i think we have to kill our own ox and
replace it with something better
i don't know what for the record
that means we wouldn't invest in a deer
here
our sharks scaling faster is probably
worth enough so like let's at least
start there
if i sell you you're gonna sell for a
bunch
like a chicken creates some bonuses
afterwards i i i you're going to think
i've lost my mind
i genuinely think i sell you for a sheep
i do and i i understand the
it's probably not going to be the most
popular decision i've ever made
i'm hoping we don't run into fly turkey
builds please it's just an incredibly
strong dodo melon armor build
okay at least we're killing the penguin
then our turkey is oh we don't even have
a turkey yet i understand the summons
are a little goofy here this is all in
service of our shark getting stronger
later that was just a very uneconomical
situation for everybody involved
um at least we're purging your melon
armor
i think we're toasted man
we ran up again i'm never going to be
mad about a seven
four but still
i fee maybe we shouldn't have pivoted
maybe we should have kept our trust in
the ox and not built around turkey and
fly but you know i saw my moment i went
for it it is what it is for now thanks
for watching hope you guys have enjoyed
the episode if you did click the like
button thanks for watching i'll see you
next time see ya



hello in record time
we must do
a super auto pets tier list this is only
the free to play units oh wait every
unit in base pack and pack one
really because i don't see a bat
am i crazy where where's my bad
that that's my indicator
it's position oh there it is right there
literally at the top
[Laughter]
so we're gonna rank every unit okay
we're gonna do it
s a b c d big ups to
mcd 644 for making a list here picture
of an uh super pet right there
themselves would you look at that uh
it's in alphabetical order okay
just imagine
this is squeeze me this is juice me
tease me freeze me
reprieve me i don't want to see you
anymore okay let's get started ant tier
one unit two one gives another unit two
one when it dies
i would be inclined to say if if you see
an ant in your first shop
that's a that's a juice me
you take it as a gimme the ant will win
you early rounds
without a doubt
and it has a synergy late where you can
pill it in order to buy me kill me
exactly i see people in chat saying buy
me kill me fish if you get one fish and
one ant in your first shop plus one roll
you you win draws and you get free wins
it's a dream come true i love it give me
uh or you i guess you could take ant
beetle as well that would be fine i love
it okay a tier maybe not quite s but
eight here
uh hatching chick this is a tough one
okay
level one gives plus five plus five
temporarily to the unit in front of it
level two gives plus two plus two
permanently level three
gives you experience on the unit in
front of it so if you can level it up
it's great it's also uh i mean like i
might even be asked here
five five early is insane like one of
the ways that i've managed to make this
work okay listen it's a tier three unit
okay let's just place it here for now
it's a tier three unit
uh so you can buy it
by the time you buy it maybe you've got
like a seven seven fish or something
like that a seven seven beetle uh a
seven seven pig maybe
now you've got a 12 12 if you put some
garlic armor on it you're you're
multiple times
this basically just enables your your
tankiest unit to wipe the entire enemy
squad by yourself is very useful i would
stop short of putting it in the s tier
because it's weird
the plus five plus five is amazing it's
like s tier useful
the plus two plus two is only okay i
actually think it gets temporarily less
useful but it's a necessary step but if
you can get it to level three early
then like this could be s tier again so
i'm gonna balance it out in the eighth
here okay
badger
i'm going to put them down in the seats
here i mean no disrespect i think it
starts as a 5-4 when it dies it deals
its attack damage to all remaining
uh to adjacent enemies so you put this
on or adjacent animals you put this on
your back line when it dies it'll
probably kill their
their unit if they still have a unit
so it it draws
losses
doesn't really win you draws but it's
it's interest i think it's situational
the way that i play this sometimes is
like
on turn three
you develop a unit so that you get to
tier three units if it's a badger i'm
like i'll take it five four stats are
uh are are pretty good early and then i
sell it from that point onwards if it
gets sniped that's disastrous
okay i think this is fair badger with b
wins you draws
uh
i mean technically true but are we
evaluating it based on uh if you add
another
three gold onto it because i mean if
we're talking about that then there's a
lot of these units that would change my
evaluation of
i also like
this is not just based on what i like to
run it's also based on like what i've
played against
and let me tell you when i see a badger
on the enemy team the first thing i
think to myself is like
this is at worst to draw most of the
time it's a win
when i when i run into a badger i'm not
saying i've never lost but i've uh
i mean it's not deed here but i've
definitely crushed
most badger teams versus like if i see
an early peacock or an early kangaroo on
the enemy team i'm like okay let's
cancel christmas
now bat it's not even close bat is
actually like uh in my opinion i'm not
an esports guy but i'm gonna pretend to
sound like one bat is a meta defining
unit it's so
uh
omnipotent well um i'm the present i
don't like how the word comes out of my
mouth but
uh weak is
you will see this every
second round if you play free to play
like it almost needs its own tear it's
it's crazy
weakness
uh
is not just great
like let's go over weakness okay
it
causes every attack that hits that enemy
to do five extra damage
which is bs that's crazy it also purges
whatever equipment they had on them
before and equipment was like insanely
uh important for so many different units
sorry it's not even free to play i mean
pay to win sorry sorry
it's it's totally oppressive i think if
you're gonna make it that
i i think weak needs to be nerfed
in the sense that i think it should only
block
or it should only make
the first attack do extra damage
it making every attack do extra damage
is insane
maybe you nerf the bat somehow instead
like maybe at level one a bat doesn't do
much extra
like like it can transform or something
like level two it has weakness level
three it has two weakness because three
is crazy but
um or maybe it pops on faint or
something like that that's interesting
but it's too good for now i think
they're always gonna have it run
overrun equipment but uh
or do you move it up a tier maybe or
something like that so it's much harder
to get a level three but it's the the
bad is so good like it's crazy talk
um so i the beaver you got to evaluate
it within the context of
the situation that it's in right uh this
is this is a tier one i think a beaver
is like a perfect
b-tier
tier one animal
the way that you do it you you don't
really rely on it
you you buy it for one round
and then you sell it to buff the units
that are gonna stick around like the
strategy that i have i'll try to buy
either a fish or a beetle
in the first couple of rounds literally
in the first round if i buy a beaver to
augment it that's great because in round
two i sell the beaver
it
buffs the fish in all likelihood as long
as you do your order right and all of a
sudden you know you've got like uh
you got like a three five fish that
maybe gets buffed even beyond that i
think it's pretty good i i think i think
given that you own the thing is you only
care about it be when it shows up in the
first round or the second round but i i
respect it in the b tier for
sure beetle
is is a tough one okay i'm gonna i'm
gonna put beetle at the high beat here
beetle is insane early
but its actual effect is garbage it's
terrible
i know you never roll food builds nl
like this is
uh something you shouldn't do but like
it's
it's the stats are awesome the two three
wins you rounds early it doesn't scale
at all so i think a b tier
knowing that you get rid of it after
that is pretty good okay now we're gonna
start making some enemies i think pretty
soon
uh the bison
i always get it confused this is maybe
this is an ox i can't remember no i know
it's or the
buffalo but anyway
it's really good
when you get its effect to work okay the
way that its effect works is that you
need to have at least a tier three then
it gets plus two plus two every turn
otherwise it's just a six six that does
nothing so if you can get this early
genuinely
you could maybe have it in the sa tier
i really rarely end up taking it because
by the time i get like a
a bison it's very rare for me to have a
uh a tier three unit or even be close
sometimes i'll have a tier two and be
three away but still
um
so i'd actually put it down here in the
seat here but i still put it over badger
honestly
now i gotta tell you blowfish
i used to think it was ester i used to
think it was the strongest
uh unit in the game
i've come down on it a little bit
i would rather have
a peacock i would rather have a kangaroo
i'd rather have a couple of things you
know going on here
but the blowfish i think is still pretty
good
you can it it at least not everything
that you buy is something that you have
to level up forever sometimes you just
buy things temporarily to help you win
some rounds so there's situations where
like maybe
you a blowfish shows up in your shop you
buy the blowfish you know you get a
turtle or something like that and then
all of a sudden you're like i got a
tanky unit it's got melon armor it gets
a couple of ability procs and then it's
like good to go
but overall this is like a maybe buy for
me sometimes
now
i know that people are going to be like
you're you're stacking up one tier in
particular here
um
bluebird
is also around here in the beats here
like
scaling is nice don't get me wrong
i think scaling is is
valuable
um
but i would rather have like a fish or
something like that
early on for sure because at one hp this
thing not only does it not live but it
only trades with like half of the tier
one animals so i i think that it could
be good um
and i do run it sometimes most of the
time i find i would rather just spend
three hp on another copy of an existing
good unit that will buff it by one one
instead of relying on this guy because
he basically exists just to get killed
um
but that's okay it's situational but
decent okay sometimes uh what the heck
does the does the buffalo do
every time you buy a friend he gets plus
one plus one right
so it's like it's a strictly superior
dog
um
look
i'm going to put a smack dab in the
middle of the beats here
i think that again it a lot of these
depend on situations right it can scale
like crazy if it shows up early
otherwise like if you get it in the late
game you're like okay it's a six six or
a seven seven or a four six maybe now
that i think about it like
it's not great but at the same time
you're also like uh i guess if a beetle
shows up in the late game you also don't
really care
[Laughter]
to be honest but um i i find it's okay
but i would rather build around a hippo
in the same tier than build around the
the buffalo
now camel
i've only started doing it recently but
i actually think camel is an a tier
unit
so if you're not familiar with the camel
i would even i might even put it there
for now
camel
when it gets hurt gives the unit behind
it plus two plus one or
plus four plus two or plus six plus
three depending on its uh
uh on its tier level
as long as you get something
behind it that benefits from that
it's crazy i mean again you the camel's
tier three right you can have a camel in
front of even like your your great tier
one unit all of a sudden you know
there's multiple i've been taking a
camel like every time it shows up lately
you can have like a 15 15 fish
once they finally punch through your
camel and you know then they just lose
like nothing else can happen
um it does super well with the kangaroo
does super well with a peacock does well
with the blowfish any anything behind it
that gets a benefit when it gets hurt
gets better because of the fact that uh
you know
gaining that extra hp is worth a lot
this is really good like that i love the
camel
uh
caterpillar
i i would honestly
you this might surprise you i would
actually put it in the eights here it is
hard to rank
i think people might have thought i was
shooting for like a lower tier here but
if you get a caterpillar within like the
first couple of rounds that the tier
threes are available i think you
basically take it
no matter what because it you just rely
on getting another
great unit and it copies it
you can't put equipment on it which
sucks you kind of need like a turtle to
enable it
i think it's good man like honestly i
respect it there's one thing that sucks
about it it gets bodied hard by like
leopard and dolphin depending on where
you put it
um
like when you
it sucks when it transforms into like
whatever it's it transforms into a
butterfly its stats stay the same for a
second and then the leopard is like
here's eight damage and it gets sniped
and you're like okay rip my 50 50. it is
also nice i feel like people don't
respect
that um
it also levels up on its own which
guarantees you higher tier units when
the levels pop is pretty good i i really
like it i would put it over an ant i
guess and
for when we see
maybe more like that
cat
i don't know what this does
cat when you buy shop food all animals
get plus one attack
oh it doubles food stats
i d okay well
i think it's bad
it's a lot of this is theory crafting
the problem is like you you immediately
start thinking in your head you know
you're like okay cat cow now i get like
4 4 milk and stuff like that but you
need so much capacity on your board to
be able to do this stuff
uh that
you you're going to have to end up if
you want to do the dream strategy you
have to sell out of the things that you
actually are attached to but i don't it
could be here as well but let's put it
here for the time being
i guess you could buy it buy a bunch of
food sell it buy something
chicken i gotta remember chicken as well
when you buy
food or a unit
it makes it's a plus one plus one to
everything in the shop
now and forever right
oh when you buy a tier one unit buffs
the shop forever
i gotta say we gotta speed up a little
bit
a lot bit um
i gotta say this is
also pretty bad
all the tier one enablers can be okay
um but i mean this is a tier five unit
itself which is nasty i would rather
just have the flexibility to buy cans
and then have like better
um animals on my squad
and i would also rather have a dragon
like the the dragon is
just a better version of this i think
squirrel i'm just gonna be honest with
you
i also kind of put it in the d tier
most of the time that i buy squirrel i'm
pissed off because i accidentally
overrun my
monsters or my animals with food where
i'm like i
i didn't want six food i just wanted
extra
food in the shop and now i gotta like
either roll and which point why did i
even do this
like i it just has no benefit sorry i
gotta speed up a little bit okay cal
you might not love
this
i think cow is high beat here maybe low
eights here
if you have capacity like you have some
garbage unit you don't mind selling
paying three gold for a a unit that
sucks but also allows you to divvy out
plus four plus four which could maybe
synergize with like some other food
buffs like a cow into a level two dodo
or something like that is sick
um
then it's amazing but there's a lot of
times where you're like i literally
can't even like do this because
everything on my board i'm attached to
like it's a four six by itself that is
not amazing i guess it's two gold that's
a good point you need capacity which you
don't always have late game and it is a
tier five but um
it's still it's still okay
yeah oh i don't know why i tried to drag
it to cell as if i was playing super
auto pets as we speak
[Laughter]
okay crab
i find it much like a badger it's kind
of situational early on again if you
have a super tanky unit that you've been
buffing for like your first few turns
then a crab pops up you're like okay
instead of a three three maybe i have
like a three eight or a three nine that
can win me some trades but i am not
excited to uh to take it most of the
time similarly i gotta tell you cricket
i don't really respect anymore
i think cricket is like
i i very rarely take it
even as a tier one now
i think you only really roll it when
you're rolling horse builds or dog
builds but i also don't or bison builds
maybe but i don't even really
roll those anymore um
so it's really it's it's kind of like a
three two but it sucks when you like
roll this and get crapped on by like a
hippo or something like that man it's
crazy um
i guess it does work well in front of
like an ox or something like that as
well but i i would rather take like
almost all tier one units over this
uh
and you always have options
it wins you the early game i don't think
so man honestly
i i genuinely don't think so
i i'm telling you fish man
fish and and beetle win you the early
game crocodile what is he seven three
does five damage to the weakest unit
i feel like it has a great effect and
bad stats
which for me
i'm just gonna level with you
that's a high c tier for me
does seven to the back oh to the last
unit
i thought
oh dolphin does to lowest hp
is really good when it is good
you know different people put units on
different lines but um if you hit a
turkey that's great if you hit a tiger
it's incredible sometimes you can hit
like a rooster and then instead of
summoning
uh like two roosters it'll or two chicks
it'll only summon one you could hit a
fly but seven three the stats are just
like not that impressive
honestly um
now deer is kind of interesting
it's one of my favorite
tier four units to take even if you're
only running it temporarily i think you
can you can place it in the mid eights
here
the caveat and it's actually kind of
nice the deer is like i'll level it up
to level two which is fine
um but then you also are you have a
decent unit out there that does really
well at level one and then you have the
capacity knowing that it sucks late game
to just
sell it and then start putting something
good in that place instead so i think
this is like a nice stop gap holder does
really well purging like melon armor off
units at the back
does really well triggering anything
that is like enemy intact enemy in front
of you attacks enemy and uh or animal in
front of you attacks animal in front of
you faints etc etc it's got some good
stuff going on okay dodo
i'm going faster okay dodo
high eights here
it's it's up here
the the only problem that i have with
the dodo it might even be close to the s
tier
you know what
i'm willing to put it there
the reason
the the only thing that sucks about it
is that so often i end up with like 50
attack units uh and then they have like
nine hp but that's not the dodo's fault
i also feel like if you like its level
two effect is incredible it's level
three effect is on maybe like the best
level three effect in the game
um
yeah it's really good plus it it sucks
up all the buffs and redistributes them
which is is nice
dog
put that in like
b tier if you build around it early and
you and you really
we we've had 10 win runs with dogs
they don't always pop oftentimes you're
going to want to sell but you can you
can scale it you can get it there
dolphin
i is very similar to crocodile for me if
i have three gold and i need to buy an
animal this is going to be like one of
the animals i'm most likely to buy and
then sell it in the next round you're
basically buying like an anti-cupcake
uh and also level two when it hits two
units is is pretty nasty
it can be very annoying and it ruins
some builds
like some the the dolphin runs might not
get to 10 wins but they're also going to
stop a lot of fly builds from getting
there
it doesn't hit 10 units what am i i'm
thinking about leopard then my mistake
dragon
i have to say this is for and maybe
controversial because it's a popular
animal for a number of reasons
i think it's okay its stats are okay the
problem with it is that in order for a
dragon to work you need the space on
your board to be able to sell
and buy tier one units to get the buffs
aoe scaling is insane
but it's the only way that you can
actually do this is to have it
contingent on having two spaces that you
can make it work on
which doesn't happen that often it you
have to have a very like specific run
for this to fit
uh into your build okay
imo at least
dromedary i think it's okay i like i
i've come down on it a little bit i
would say like maybe we're looking at a
c tier for a dromedary but it's okay i
would put it closer to like like right
on the beaver border line here maybe
maybe we'll throw that in in the end of
b for now duck
is is tight okay i'm gonna i'm gonna
throw you something controversial
i think duck is an a t or tier one
there is a a a poison pill to swallow
it's a one two so it sucks
but
you ex you you play for a draw hopefully
in round one or round two then you sell
all your ducks when you get that first
tier three promotion and all of a sudden
you can have like a like a five eight
blowfish on round three
and you will win enough games to
compensate for the one that it might
have lost you and it might not lose you
you might still draw with it i'm telling
you it's the way to go it's good it's
good
eagle
overrated but still decent i'm going to
put this in the beat here
not bad
maybe i understated a little bit
but i i think it's it's merely mid
elephant is like
high c okay it's it's a trap
in order like
this is like an anti-scaling unit the
more it levels up the worse it gets
uh unless you build your entire team
around
hurt triggers which
really wedges you into a specific
situation that you cannot escape from
fish
i mean i gotta tell you i think it's
it's like a better beetle
this is the unit i look for round one
round two
it you it's almost impossible to lose
one of your first two rounds with a
couple fish you will you will either win
or or come out even
flamingo
i know you can pill it okay so you kind
of buy it as a 3-1
use it for one round pill it and give
one one
i would be inclined to say that this is
somewhere in the b tier does okay with
the whale maybe
but i'm not
i would maybe say
you know
it's a b or c
it's a better ant it's a better duck
yeah but it's also a tier three
so it's not really like a better ant
because if i can't get it out there
until the enemies are already so much
stronger that the plus one plus one is
not as valuable as the plus two plus one
was earlier on you know
i was more valuable like a a cookie
when you're dying of hunger in the
desert or
like a feast when you're already full
anyway sorry sorry
um
fly
is a tier i would say not s
the only reason
it's not s
i feel like you can put a bat into
almost anything you could put a dodo
into almost anything
the fly
sometimes forces you to make some tough
choices because it itself sucks its
effect is incredible
all these are universally applicable
giraffe
call me crazy scaling oh my god i gotta
go so much faster
scaling is very valuable okay but
uh plus one plus one is too slow if you
level it up more then it gets good but
for now
not so much
similarly
goats
well i wouldn't put it at the very
bottom when you buy a friend you get one
gold i'm just telling you
buy sell meta is like one of the most
fun builds to play
with the shrimps and the goats and the
and the so-ons but i've never had a
great rum with it
so i think it belongs down here um
gorilla
i never do uh well with
because i always end up in a situation
where it dies in one hit but if it lives
through one hit it usually gets two
kills which is kind of amazing so
i would say gorilla can be in the a tier
hedgehog is very similar to badger but i
would say a little bit worse
put them back here a hedgehog at the
back can do some good stuff for you
you know it's the same thing it turns
losses into draws sometimes you get
draws into wins hippo now hippo
i'm merely going to place it in the a
tier
but it can definitely be in the s tier
it depends how early you can get it it
depends how quickly you can scale
sometimes it dies in one hit and you're
like this thing's a piece of crap
sometimes you go up against a white
weenie build and you don't even have to
use animals two through five so i i
genuinely love a hippo but i feel like
it's
it's not quite s horse
is fine but it's kind of a beginner trap
kangaroo though that's an eight-year
animal i don't know exactly where i'm
gonna put it
um but kangaroo is is insanely good if
you can get either a unit in front of it
that dies
and then spawns a unit and then dies or
a unit in front of it that's tanky and
it it scales like insanely i might you
know what
it fits a lot of builds i might even put
it there
uh ladybug actually like i'm sure i'm
probably using it wrong but
just a much worse beetle in my opinion
leopard
over
highly highly overrated
everybody wants me to buy this every
time it shows up
it's not good
i'm telling you in my opinion it's not
good i i don't know if i have ever lost
to a leopard
like for my 10 wins i lose to kangaroos
all the time i lose the flies i lose the
turkeys i lose to dogs i lose the
butterflies okay
i'm on my way apollo my mama we got five
minutes okay i've only got to rate 30
animals in that time
um i don't think i've ever lost to a
leopard okay like i'm just here we go
llama
too much of a workaround lobster nobody
knows what you do here we're going
faster alright you ready mammoth
useful
but overrated
microbes
low b tier
but when you build around it it blows
them out it blows them out
monkey everybody says the monkey's asked
here
you're crazy
i think it's like a a high b
high a
look i'm ranking it according to my
preferences but knowing that i'm off
based on what the populace says i will
do more labbing in the lavatory with the
monkey okay
mosquito
high c tier
octopus go ahead be mad we had the dream
octopus build the first time we ever had
it that anchored in our brain as the
octopus being a top tier unit it's never
happened again
it will never happen again i've never
seen it happen against me
anytime i see an octopus i'm like good
we're gonna smack it to death we we got
the most incredible octopus run of all
time it's time to let it live in the
past okay
otter
that's a mid b tier
tier one unit it's a nice it it comes
with like an apple it's a nice buy
and you don't feel bad about selling it
later owl
again situational 5'3 is good stats for
a tier three when you sell it you get so
you get a nice statistical benefit out
of it but is you're never gonna be like
oh no an owl
ox
most underrated unit in the game
parrot um
here's the thing right
a parroted turkey what if you just
parrot a turkey hey what if you just
parrot uh uh
you know a dog or something like that
okay what have you just had a second dog
what have you just had a
a second turkey right like you don't
need
both of these a tiger is incredible a
parrot is a trap and the fact that it
imprints whatever it gets i don't
respect it c tier peacock you already
know that's we're up here in the eights
here penguin
highly
highly overrated highly overrated
i'm gonna put that in the seat here as
well
the the fact that you need tier twos to
make it work is where it becomes
dangerous okay pig i'm not gonna
gigabrain you and put this in the a tier
but i do think it's high b
it basically costs you one gold to get a
two two temporarily early which is great
peacock a better peacock is a better or
sorry poodle
poodle is a better
penguin a better
penguin there's no doubt about it the
the poodle will scale your whole team if
you build it properly
puppy
can win you the game by itself rabbit
anything with food is not respectable
dirty rat worst unit in the game rhino
absolutely bodies white weenie builds
lose to loses to everything else but is
fine
rooster
is the slap of the city
it's the talk of the town
rooster is insanely good
i wouldn't say best unit of the game
while bats exist
but it's insanely good
dies to buses okay your bus is never
gonna get to my rooster because it's
gonna get on by whatever my front
line unit is and then you're gonna kill
my rooster and be like i won then tiger
rooster all of a sudden you got four you
know 51 chicks out there going bam bam
bam bam okay we go faster faster we got
one minute okay faster sauropod
i don't respect the gold builds late
scorpion situationally useful
temporarily
seal
 pisses me off because it's
always like hey if i eat something i'll
buff somebody else then i buy like sushi
and it hits every unit except the seal
and i'm like okay how about you don't
let the door hit yourself uh hit you on
the way out dumbass shark a tier a
functional must-have unit
sheep
does well sometimes
uh shrimp i'm just gonna be honest with
you
it's probably like the most fun unit in
the game that sucks
i i buy it almost every time uh but
it's not good and then sometimes i've
run two of them and it's just
it's insane but it's hilarious him me
him him me skunk
temporarily useful at best snail a tier
plus two plus two on everything is
insane snake
wins games spiders
keeps the end games swans i overrated
them for a while i would say this is a b
tier unit t-rex
everybody loves scaling
i would say this could fit in your a
tier tabby cat plus one attacks uh
temporarily tell me you never get bought
without telling me you never get bought
tiger
is s you just put it behind the s tier
unit and then it's automatically s by
definition tropical fish i overrated it
for a long time turkey wins you the game
by itself tortel
easy melon armor early in the game whale
double faint triggers is disgusting worm
tell me you're about to lose the game
without telling me you're about to lose
the game this is it prince screen the
definitive tier list
of super auto pets and we were only one
minute late i stand by all of my
rankings until i play more of this uh
one
a week from now we'll do a reevaluate
and then see how they compare that's not
a promise by the way



hey everybody welcome back to some super
auto pets
it's a monday night look i need to play
something
that's not super auto pets
it's really just like like a lot of
super auto pets
i think we'll do it like this it's a bit
spicy
a lot of super auto pets a lot of uh
a lot of isaac mostly super auto pits
but i was like what else do i want to
play man i i like it the audience likes
it largely um obviously everybody's
different but oh boy lions the gushing
feet here we are
this is dang old draw right here wait no
actually it's an easy win i don't know
how to do mathematics um
played a little bit this weekend too on
the android version having just a just a
grand old time
what a great game um pardon me
i think
we're gonna roll two more ants here
we're gonna do some serious combining
early which is going to lead us to a
situation where we're going to be able
to get a level three unit early
uh and may or tier three i should say
and maybe maybe a
tier four unit very soon after that
we shall see did not want to see that
but life goes on
this is the easiest one of my life i'm
telling you
the ants they just win you rounds early
here so we're 2-0 mostly just due to
having amazing shops
um
i'm not against
trying to roll like a a dog build here i
get that we could pill here but i
actually
i respect what we got going on okay
early puppy beats everything else imo
um the scaling we can get out of that is
disgusting
i think we're gonna work our way towards
a uh
just freeze oh my god we are gonna get a
next level uh upgrade here in a sec roll
me one more time okay
we're gonna make a level two ants
uh we saved some money in order to scale
the puppy by the way we're gonna get a
level two ants we're gonna combine it
with our other level two ant to make a
level three
i don't know what to say man
that's that's incredible
we do pretty badly for a bit here this
might actually be a loss
that's that's not great yeah i mean it's
it's
definitely a loss we were you know two
hp away from being able to turn it
around but this is very good this is an
incredible situation for us
we have another puppy that is just going
straight into the into the
i was gonna say the
the grist here but that's not really
what i mean
these will combine to make a level three
um but we don't really want to do that
yet
we want to roll a little give me a
flamingo a flamingo to freeze a soul to
squeeze we're gonna keep two ants up
there for now the puppy is six six
stands to get pretty amazing buffs here
we'll combine the ants next turn
we have to work around our fiscal
situation no puppy please no puppy
weakness ant weakness i can live with
peacock is going to be uh of course very
annoying but
once it gets to a certain attack it's
not that big of a deal anyway
this is that nine seven man
what can you say
this
i mean i don't see how this
couldn't be a loss yeah so we're
actually gonna
after all that we went through here
we're gonna be down to two two we moved
up in the winner's bracket a little too
early uh but i'm very very far from
upset
we're gonna do a combination
i don't really care for a squirrel but a
level 3 ant is fine by itself a cricket
can be sold
a fish can be sold
a snail uh don't buy this snail yet
though
i think you buy a swan
and then honestly i'm like maybe you buy
uh just for now a puffer fish
now you gotta you gotta look at your
numbers here
i think you could snail me
i was gonna do a sell me by me i don't
think it's the case though
because we want a flamingo up there but
this sells for one then this bias for
three puts us out of our fiscal
our our best fiscal situation a
caterpillar
instead of you know what i'm gonna
freeze me that caterpillar for now
that can do really well
uh against why why is your aunt at the
back
[Laughter]
pure idiocy the caterpillar with a with
a scaling puppy can do very well though
so we're up against the worm here which
is totally fine um
the worm is not really popped yet which
is great news
this we know this is bad uh but this is
pretty good
this puppy like a it might shock you but
the puppy can really do some good work
it just needs a little bit of time to
get off the ground it probably won't
shock you let's be honest so we're up to
3-2
you
are gone
i think we i don't know how long we're
gonna roll the blowfish
but for now it does give us a benefit to
like buy
kill this is this is probably the the
way i'd like to do the kill
um
if you're gonna commit to a caterpillar
you you pretty much have to do it
right away
we can buy one more thing i would
probably just invest in a salad then
because we need to keep the puppy
scaling because now the puppy is also
essentially scaling the caterpillar
every time it goes
13 11 melon armor
is not good
don't hit the blowfish please thank you
um let's go that was huge the only way
you can get melon armor by the way this
early is they must have had a turtle and
then pilled it to put melon armor
uh up on it but that's that's a smart
move you can't be upset about that
that's just uh that's shrewd gameplay
we are gonna draw just barely but
it's a draw nonetheless
it's okay i'd like to win but really
every time we don't lose
we last a little bit longer or we get a
little bit more scaling
these are these are big plays for us so
i think we definitely want garlic on our
puppy
i'm not sold that we're gonna be rolling
the blowfish forever i think we can get
the puppy leveled again or uh
buffed again roll me again got yes
now
i
there's a case to be made that maybe you
could sell an anther a swan
and then
we could put a turtle
up instead pill it
and then get uh
permanent melon armor early on our
blowfish which could be nice
hmm
level one bat don't hit my puppy please
that's not ideal but life goes on
man this is a disaster um
the real question is whether our puppy
can solo the whole squad
the answer is
unfortunately no
because of the uh the b
so that's a that's a shrewd team there
you can't be mad
well played it wasn't just you know your
classic meta build
um
you know how i think you do this and
this we're taking big risks here okay
i think you sell a swan
you want a rhino
we want a turtle as well if we got to
sell the ant to make that happen then
then so be it
well i think we get for now we sell the
ants we buy the cow
we buff you because you you could really
get us out of a jam here we're keeping
that turtle frozen
interesting
and we're looking for a pill
which we are thankful enough to get one
more roll here okay
next turn we sell cow we give rhino
melon armor and we're really just
rooting for um
that caterpillar to get to 50 50. we
gotta we gotta well it's gonna take a
long time don't get me wrong but we're
in a no uh we we cannot lose situation
and by cannot i don't mean the
definition of cannot we're like
you know it's impossible i mean the
definition of cannot where it's like we
if we do it um
then we're out
yeah that makes sense
sure why not
for one it was a bit of a lucky win
that's what the garlic armor is there
for
sell you
buy you
kill you
mel and you
we need to um
make space really like i want to buy you
but then we can't keep our scaling up so
i think instead we'll we'll freeze you
and then for now i honestly think you
can just roll this
probably that's a freeze
if we make it through this round this is
a very good situation a situation where
i think we can start to talk about
potential greatness
that is very painful but we purge your
melon armor
and we live
which means we get to hit you again
which actually doesn't do that much for
us
uh it comes down to the puppy i think
because we're running into some troubles
here
this is a draw
just barely and it's just because of
your weakness like that that level too
bad did enough
congratulations
but now
that's mighty good now a sauropod
it's a very interesting idea
that we're gonna re-roll past
immediately um
you do give a a permanent buff as we get
a little further along here so there's
something to be said about that
we can't really put anything on you
unfortunately
i think this is okay
so we're probably i guess we'd probably
prioritize leveling up the chick first
to get to the permanent plus two plus
two that could really make our rhino pop
maybe
that's nice though
it sucks that we don't quite kill you
but at least we get you on this next one
and then you just get steamrolled so
this is where like the our our build
strengths are now coming home to roost
hopefully
the butterfly had it had a big upfront
cost and then would you look at that
matrix
987654321
should have taken the the blue pill
everybody loves the octopus don't get me
wrong
now
originally i was like
we don't need it
now i'm like
i actually think with two octopuses we
we could get something going here
we roll again
don't don't need to freeze we need to
save some money poodle's kind of
interesting five three three three three
okay not really that interesting
um
this is a bit of a vulnerable one for us
because the the chick it has like a an
immediate lowering of efficacy but then
it gets
you know over time you scale past it uh
you're gonna do 28 damage our melon
armor will actually keep us alive we've
purged our own weakness there
anti-bat technology you love to see it
uh now this is not good but that's okay
level two chick here i i'm actually like
i'm a little frightened i think we might
be looking at
i think we're definitely looking at a
loss
can you believe it
probably
it's more likely than you think
we did go five and one i thought we
could borrow five and four i should say
i i wish we had been able to push it a
little further i was optimistic we would
have been able to but alas so be it
pig's okay pig pig is a setup
uh a setup play
i'm honestly and you you can
quote me on this one i'm not sold on the
bird
love a crunchy bagel man i'm not sold on
the bird like the plus one plus zero
scaling is not amazing but it can make a
difference early but i think it it leads
to and and this is like you replay you
so right
[Laughter]
no i think this is a draw
um weirdly enough but uh
charmed i'm sure the dry mouths it's not
uh
i i think that it's a little
overrated let's put it that way
so i think this is a big time sell
situation
and then
uh we'll buy again i i like a 2 2 that
also gives us plus zero plus one one
time plus one gold back when we sell it
it's like we're not buying a beaver
we're really just renting it
and an ant i don't really feel like we
need two
um but it could be worse and i
definitely do feel like having two pigs
out here is okay because we get great
sales out of them next time freeze me
even if we lose this round this is all
in the service of our future setup
the bare hands okay
worst case scenario this is a draw
they've they've combined so much
yeah i mean it's definitely uh not a win
but it's definitely not worse than a
draw
okay i don't mind
it's weird to take a caterpillar with
like no
way around it you know what i mean like
we don't have any engine for this to
like adhere to right now
so i think we're just gonna do it like
this i know the pill exists okay don't
you don't have to tell me that that dang
pill exists
very okay with this
we're gonna roll for yeah okay freeze me
and then
freeze me
freeze me
like that
it's it's a weird one okay i think this
is how you set it up though um and i
think we definitely like i don't mind
having a bat here but now we know a
turtle counters a bad really hard uh and
dude microbe oh my god microbe is
i'm loving the microbe meta
my pig has been rendered weak
not a big problem
get owned
okay now it's a big problem
that's not who you needed to get that
buff we will come away with a loss on
this one honestly a little bit of luck
was involved i'm not trying to act like
it was all
rng but there is there's some rng
involved in the game
i think we should look at
like a combined just for now
a buy
a combine we got to get some stronger
units out on the field
now unfortunately we basically need to
buy
our whole shop
just not what i want to see
but
i think it gives us an okay set up for
the for future purposes
yeah let's try something like this
i don't know i
i'm this has worked out for me in the
past building like a synergistically but
instead in the service of just having
some strong units but this is a very
scary squad i see here i don't know if
that's ideal um
it's okay
we need that on the on the pig would
have been a nice hit honestly
uh you know with weakness i bet we draw
thanks to the uh
thanks to the hedgehog that's pretty
much just pure luck
still searching for that first win
you need to go
you probably need to go even though we
did just create you
roll me
okay this is a buy knowing we're we're
buying it basically for the stats here
freeze me
freeze me
honestly i'm like
maybe freeze me
by me
and then roll me like
like that i don't know man we still have
two gold what are we gonna do with two
gold you're gonna roll you're gonna
you're gonna freeze the whole shop i
don't think so just freeze that don't
freeze your flamingo
i wouldn't freeze the ant anymore either
i don't know i don't know what i'm
doing don't know what i'm doing man i'm
just sending it
well i
if i could choose
i probably would not have made uh a
one-one worm week but
what do i know
yeah that's that's incredibly bad for
business look at that
this squad is not doing anything man
this squad is is i'm just gonna say it's
kind of garbage
let's get a buff on this bat
and a buff on
um something else okay so you get sold
this is crazy man
buy me a sheep
kill you
sell you
that's very nice
buy me a a bat
no but
buy me a sn buy me a bat
buy me a turtle
then buy me a snail keep the bat frozen
so we got some room to work with next
time
um
our turtle should probably
keep our ant alive i suppose let's keep
you going man um
but now i'm like dude okay you know what
just freeze me this is i'm spiraling man
i don't know what i'm doing here this is
this is disastrous
garlic armor is not a help for me right
now your caterpillar's not doing too
much okay we've removed your garlic
armor that is helpful
now we get to hit you
we're gonna trade with the dog
which benefits us because we get a nice
uh buff afterwards
this is a win okay
there you go
the upset herbs
you couldn't stop me
unfreeze me
create me
by a tier one animal buff your shop we
don't have a whole lot of room to work
with
yet
i'm thinking this is a way we can maybe
get ourselves out of a a bit of a jam
freeze me
okay um so we're going to try and this
will involve
probably removing the ant
and then just you know can buy sell buy
sell buy sell where it would like
another wall street bets style built
1413
bison
that is getting buffed because you got a
strong beaver
phrasing perhaps this is this is nice
for us now the clean ice cubes is gonna
be a very scary team in the future
um with their uh
with their two caterpillars but you
gotta make it to you know a few wins
first
or at least uh not get that many losses
so i think we can can
i'd like to pill you but it is you know
what we could probably sell our sheep
instead for now
even though we did invest in it getting
buffed this is a buy
then a cell
which gives you a benefit
and then it's a
a buy
and then a cell
then we can roll once
we got some pretty serious business
happening here
there's no tier ones that's okay though
um
considering we're leaving this open as
like a flex spot
i think i think i'd rather have
you know the the plus five plus five for
one turn it's basically like we get we
get a unit that's a five five which is
not bad and then we get a a double
cupcake on the bat as well i think this
squad has some interesting long-term
potential
that's always nice
we don't mind
266 rams
excuse me
what did these are just strong units man
that's a scary thought here
this is a loss
i'm a little surprised
it was not even really that close
honestly so we're at 2-3
yikes
but that's okay probably um because you
can sell me and then
buy me
and then sell me
and then buy me
and then sell me
certainly a part of me looks to this as
like maybe some garlic armor would hit
the spot
maybe freeze that for a second
no tier ones
there's a 710 caterpillar
friend eats shop food give plus one
health
you know
for the time being
a 9 8 that also carries a little buff
alongside it
why not we need the this is a super
interesting build if we can just avoid
the specter of death for
a time i see a 33-27 puppy
it did get made weak which is nice for
us we definitely got the rng benefit
there
we i was just going to say we need to
live through that without a doubt
and we actually are going to win i was
rooting for a draw
but the the rng benefited us to an
outrageous degree
now you could kill the ants
i think we can now start to think about
the value there
they got buffed right before death which
is of course uh interesting um you're
probably going to get sold too but roll
me once
sell me
now there is a
the buffalo
is a very interesting idea here because
we could buy the buffalo for example
then we buy a cricket
i don't know if the math works i buy a
pig
sell a pig
five gold
i mean it's an eight nine cricket man
i think you can you can do it in the in
the service of making your buffs like
look at look at these units down here
freeze me freeze me freeze me roll me
freeze me i have no idea if this will
work
but it's fun i mean all the we got a
bunch of crappy units because they're
level one but on the flip side oh my god
you're a level three bat that's all
right
to some ex to some extent
because we do get melon armor here which
overrides it
we kill you
we kill you
we draw but then we have a cricket at
the backside
that lets us actually pull out a dub
there
would you look at that
now
you're like okay hold on hold the front
door man i think you sell a turtle i
know that we've been through a lot you
sell a turtle you sell a cricket you buy
a dragon and then this is where we hit
like oblivion hours here
because then you like buy a mosquito
sell a mosquito
you buy a fish
you sell a fish
you buy a buy an ant
buy buy a blue bird
sell a blue bird
buy an ants
do not sell an ant okay um
well that's novel
we got a very strong squad i don't know
if this bodes well for our long-term
health but
25-25
this is a scary team man
we needed to hit the puppy oh my god
dude our luck with respect to that has
just been disgusting
still
please tell me we we draw
oh my god we draw
saved saved and these draws mouth xxx
these draws are huge for us
because every draw and i know maybe the
pill matters but
i'm i'm actually i mean i just want the
gold honestly
because every purchase is worth so much
for us i
i know you're thinking the cow here
but i'm
i i think we got to invest in just some
rolling instead
like a a tier 1 unit is so much more
valuable for us now we got a
1719 blowfish if we want one
i think even though this doesn't fit
like our current scaling i think you
could roll that
and then also just put like a blowfish
right here or something like that i mean
it's just 17 19 even at level one it's
just gonna chunk some damage out there
i like where i look against this squad
although i do hate the weakness
from the bad
it hit like the exact wrong enemy but we
still we're doing some good chunking
the chunking is still happening here
this looks fine to me
that's a win
even with the the bat spam
we're now at five
now i'm like the double dragon is a very
interesting idea okay
i still
people are going to tell me sell the
chicken you'll get a dragon going
instead i'm telling you
when it's working
one one day it will stop working
for the time being it's doing great work
so we're gonna adhere to a very simple
and and very similar strategy
we don't need to sell them yet because
we we could keep an ant up there but i
think we'll sell now
we'll roll a fish
1920 fish
i mean
[Laughter]
i don't know what to say
actually it's gonna be a 2021 fish right
yeah jeez well look at that 20 21 who
would have thought
35 35 up at the front
microbe is not that bad for us i think
because we were already
oh micro plus turtle is kind of horrible
yeah that's pretty bad
i think this is probably a loss
you got to hand it to them like that was
a perfect build to get around this i was
having a good time with that funky
chicken build though for now thanks for
watching maybe two five pieces
life goes on if you enjoyed it click the
like button
thanks for watching subscribe if you
want to see more in the future i'll see
you with some more super auto pets
thanks for watching



hey everybody welcome back it's super
auto pants um having
some decent runs lately obviously you
always wish you could do a little bit
better we we haven't had a a run
where we like blew the doors off
recently but that's okay maybe it all
starts with a good team name
how about the broken ice cubes
excuse me while i clear my throat i
think this is a losing team early
um
i don't see how that could not be the
case
no i think it's a draw ring team early
[Laughter]
yeah okay lucky us just barely it's not
my ideal like first shop run for sure
let me tell you that um
now this is a little bit more like it i
definitely like a beetle
two threes the stats are just disgusting
we take our chances
you love to see it
i think we still like a 2-2 that gives
basically plus two
pig is okay it sets up a nice future
turn
this is a little bit more like it
i would say roll me one more time
i would say freeze me
okay
now obviously like a horse would hit the
spot here but
or a dog for that matter but you don't
really see too many like white weenie
style decks here
they are basically decks i guess now
that i think about it
you peace
i don't see how this could be anything
but a loss
i mean ants just win in a lot of
situations
and then we're only gonna be doing four
damage to you yeah so this is a loss i
mean just it's just a beefy cricket back
there beefy beetle back there we only
lost by one damage that's okay we don't
sweat those man
that's unsweatable in my house
plenty of room to work with here okay
do a a shrimp is a funny build okay
you peace
i don't think we want it
um
uh we should we should have taken the
shrimp if we were going to do that but
i i don't trust the rap babe people are
saying the rabbit's a little underrated
if that's the case you know what
if that's the case i'm willing to get a
little freaky okay
i'm willing to give
very freaky
i don't necessarily expect this to work
if it doesn't i'll probably hit the
escape key and restart the run
um
it is a level two cricket
please buff that creature
level two cricket
this is a loss
madame gifts work
i mean all things considered i know i
say that a lot when we lose
we we took a bit of a lark on that one
you can't be too upset
you love a bat don't get me wrong while
our team sucks though i think a hedgehog
is kind of an interesting idea
um
and i'm just trying to roll like
something that's not a bat for the time
being
look
this is not meant to be a throw i'm just
like while we have the rabbit i think
you invest in future considerations
man this is pretty ugly don't don't
don't okay that's fine
i think this is another loss
just hit the button just
just just go ahead
well thanks for watching everybody hope
you enjoyed the uh
hope you enjoyed the episode there um
we're gonna run it back four minutes in
here
this is a great this is the the squad of
dreams
now i know in
historically
i have said i'm not a huge fan
be the adorable piggies
um i'm not a huge fan of the bird
turn one
you get a but you could do worse let's
put it that way you could do worse than
a bird i mean don't you know when
haven't you heard haven't you heard the
bird is the let's go
we still
draw
but just barely
that's the best what the heck it's the
best way it could have gone for us i
think
so we like this
honestly we keep this maybe we don't
keep it frozen anymore but i think we
can just roll once
and maybe invest in our uh in our fish
for the time being it's gonna be a 7-4
but really it's actually like a nine to
five like dolly pardon
shoot my fish
let's go i think
i don't know if it could have gone
better than that
i think this is uh
it's a draw again
because you shot my fish but i think
anything else you shot would have
created the same results so i'm not
i'm not sweating it dr skoctopus what a
name now
this is where things get interesting i
don't mind the sheep early i think a
sheep early can do some work man
and a ba to you as
well why don't you hit me with one of
these hit my fish please
that's not so bad we're going to roll
this bird for a bit
now a fish on the other well we have to
buy something here we might as well buy
this um do we buff a fish or do we buff
a ram i think you buff a fish
you can tune a fish
but you can't tune a piano is that that
joke
i don't remember
10 for fish versus 10-4 fish what an
what an interesting situation we got
here
this is uh the oh i was gonna say it's a
draw but i forgot our ram creates some
uh
detritus after it dies look at that we
got our first win we're at one loss zero
losses all right i'm a believer in this
squad right now
i still think this is a heavy sell even
if it hits this bird but you did life
goes on
we i don't love a spider but it does fit
the present mechanics of our build
i think
we love the concept of adding a swan
into this and a 10-4 i like that fish
but we're gonna start to invest in our
swan instead
and you know
i think i'm okay with that
i'm not promising you the world here but
but two extra gold per turn is uh it's
got some spice associated with it hey
that would have paid for buying a spider
and then selling it back on the same
turn
you might think that it's a mistake all
i would say in response to that
is that i think the bigger mistake would
have been to just hold on to it because
we bought it this turn and then you get
that like endowment effect and you uh
you know end up suffering as a result
then you go the spider's not that good
well yeah that's why you know it can be
good at one
data point in time and then bad at the
next it happens
so i think we like it
i think we will invest in maybe trying
to get to a level two fish
that seems fine to me
and then while we're here
you're gonna stick around
for a bid
so let's buff you the most
the sheep is the next to go but before
we get rid of the sheep we'll probably
combine the swans
the sheep does not do well here
that's unfortunate
maybe it's not so bad
i mean the bat bodies us here but that's
fine we then two for one
um i think we definitely die to uh the
rams actually
but even if we got through the rams like
we didn't have the hp necessary to get
through the dog
but that's okay we leverage our our
present in order to improve our future
it's pretty amazing
and these are some some strong units
i'm even like i'm in a buy me sell me
mood right here man
hey tomo you okay buddy
i think we do it like this
turtle's always nice you know and then
i'm kind of
i guess you freeze it just in case
so i'm not promising you the world on
this run either but uh
we're gonna have a level two swan which
should unlock maybe tier four units for
us tier five units maybe um no bat
that's nice to see
we've been debuffed a little
life goes on
i don't think that went as badly for us
as you might have assumed
i think we win it it really comes down
to the the skunk
versus the swan and i'll i'll bet on a
swan in that situation hey tomorrow
what's wrong man you doing all righty
okay so dump this where three wins one
loss
tier five eats shop food random friends
get plus one plus one we might start
becoming a heavy buyer here
i'm thinking it's like a sell me
buy me
buy me
buy me
buy me
freeze me
garlic me for the swan or the fish i
don't know it's it's a bit strange this
is not a typical squad necessarily i
don't really know like what a seal does
long term
level two bat is a piece of garbage but
if it hits the seal which it didn't
[Laughter]
we would have been okay
because we would have had the melon
armor on top but i mean we're still okay
and we're
okay
and we're okay
and we're okay and this is a win
sorry i'm leaning a little bit out of
frame by the way my my good son tomo's
here hey tomo
hello
okay so we want level three bird for now
microbe plus turtle is disgusting
i think we should try
i think you sell your fish even though
the stats are amazing you roll a microbe
up front
you keep investing in your in your
turtle
garlic doesn't apply to anybody anymore
so like we we basically are forced to
roll
no you want the melon armor to pop later
we're forced to roll for a better
situation here
five one three five two
you would sell a bird
to roll a poodle
i'm not fully sold
this is a huge pivot for us by the way
so this this represents a big change
obviously garlic on the bird is no
longer applicable but they can't take
away the winds we've already gotten from
it
okay so your your bison is
is going to be and also ran here
we crush you on this this this this is a
win i mean most people are not going to
be equipped to handle the the micro
build early here
this is a pretty early pivot for it
now we're hoping to roll into a level
two turtle would would make a big
difference
rhino
rhino behind the turtle in this
situation is really appealing to me
especially when you consider all the
weakness
i think we can sell our bird i know it's
a level three the garlic armor is
irrelevant
but i'm telling you
this build
is gonna slap no reason to buy garlics
apples are i mean i guess you just apple
you
you could roll a b
no because it's going to get overridden
anyway
i always i'm out thinking myself we can
roll a quick salad let's go lucky little
force multiplier there
feel like you might as well freeze might
as well roll might as well unfreeze this
i don't know how long i've had that
active but um so the hope is i mean
another level turtle is sick but the
hope is also that this rhino basically
goes infinite uh once everybody gets
weakness applied i'm a little worried
about the effects of this so-called
chili pepper oh never mind
no
you you did to me what i was trying to
do to you
okay well that you know what you gotta
say fair play on that one valentino well
done
your your rhino beats my rhino
checkmate
bro you gotta give me this turtle
hey tomo
i i think maybe you start to think about
selling
your seal
it has done good buffing itself
where it's an investment
so that we have some space to work with
freeze me just in case but i'm do i'm
fishing for this freaking turtle man i
am fishing for this freaking turtle get
buffed get buffed
get sold get bought this rhino i'm
telling you
it has infinite power the infinity stone
within it
level one turtle okay i see
i see the problem your bat becomes
useless thankfully
we're going to remove your melon armor
then we're going to live
and we're going to hit you it's not
going to kill you then you're going to
kill me
oh you peace
you live by one
i mean you live by one unit but it's
also one hp okay so we're down to our
last life here i mean we really need
this next turtle
hey tomorrow
i'm telling you if we get
one turtle or a chocolate bar it changes
everything for us
we don't need a dragon this is also
gonna get sold um and you're probably
taking some armor here is there anything
like we i know like one up is it gets
overridden on everybody but the microbe
there's not much reason to have it on
the microbe
i gotta let this guy out of the office
oh okay um
buy me
sell me
freeze me i know you're gonna be like
what are you doing well this is a roll
actually roll me once we'll roll a
leopard here and it's the the leopard is
just to exist or maybe a mammoth
but we need the mammoth more at the
front that's not really a good play the
leopard's kind of stinky though
ah we'll give it a try i mean i don't
think it's stinky overall i think it's
stinky temporarily this level two turtle
though i i completely believe in it the
rhino is like the biggest trap in the
game man it gets me every time
level three caterpillar it's only going
to become a 1921 though that's not that
spooky
weakness overrides your garlic armor
that's fantastic
it's a nice little smack there what the
heck you got a microbe too
where did that come from
no
no two
bruh
okay well we what was that five dude we
can't get over the five hump lately
i'm running one more back you can't stop
me it's my day off
this is a squad
this is a squad
i want to keep that beaver frozen
squeaky
nefarious
craters what an excellent band name
hello my son
you okay
this is an interesting is it everything
about this looks like a draw to me but i
very famously have no idea what i'm
talking about so
i'm pretty sure this is a draw
no sweat
i think you can
buy me
sell me
that's the dream setup
roll me because i don't love those units
you're going to combine me next turn
you're going to roll a fish at the back
you're going to roll me one more time
honestly bird was okay for us last time
pardon me but the stats on the beetle
are
are really good like a 2 3
tends to hit above its its weight class
and we got a few of them oh no
did you see his hat
it's a fedora with safari flaps at the
back
this looks like a this looks like a
guaranteed
statistical draw to me oh well i had one
more hp so i'll take the win there if
that doesn't bother you
then this is your easy mode play you
know we get a four five
which i have absolutely no problem with
we stack you up at the front here
i like this
um
freeze me roll me
peacock peacock
salt peanut
um
sell me
knowing that
we're gonna pill you later
then you're actually gonna take this
spot up here you're going to take this
spot behind the ants
we're going to freeze you we're going to
freeze you keep that that flamingo out
here 6 10 peacock early is going to ruin
a lot of people's days
this this makes me a bad man
we throw in a little extra garlic on top
you know the the world's your oyster hey
tomorrow
hello buddy
my sweet boy
so we're killing everybody but the fish
the fish has three hp
this is not bad
i'm not saying this is a 10 spot but
we're on on some good momentum to
possibly get
to get over the the five hump hopefully
um maybe i should
not kill my chickens before they hatch
pig's gonna stick well you know what pig
and chick are gonna stick around the pig
benefits most from the stats right now
so let's do it like that
unfortunately
we do need to
we need to fill a squad
this will take us to nine right
that means we could oh but we can't roll
these we could buy
roll and then we have space to put
something else in here
i don't know man i don't know i don't
know what i'm thinking really
she give me one of those
what is it my man
freeze me and by freezing me i mean
leave okay hey tommo you wanna do you
want to show up on camera will we fight
the
sticky eyes apparently not that's okay
hey level one bat
didn't hit my peacock that's all i could
ask for
10 13.
we lived
that's beautiful i don't see us winning
this though the fish is too strong
that's a level three fish that's that's
uh that's very spicy man that's that's a
good team
i honestly we just ran into a great
gamer i can't be mad
now
this is a combine
and a buy
and then i think it's a honestly like a
bye bye but we can roll one more time
just to see where we stand
and i definitely think you can dump this
to get a little slice of that
should freeze you just in case again
we want some garlic on our peacock next
time
phrasing but
you know what
we really want to draw at a minimum here
i don't mind seeing a level 2 dromedary
that's like it the meta situation is bad
for us the real situation is totally
fine
peacock you're doing lovely work
this is kind of what we're rooting for
now we don't want to invest too heavily
in the peacock because we're probably
going to pivot off of it later unless
maybe we get like a kangaroo or
something but
hasn't happened yet
puppy's not the right time it's not
it's not that late but it might be a
little too late i think this is a sell
freeze
roll
by freeze situation
freeze me
roll me
save me this is this is mighty nice
this boy is so
so clingy right now
okay level one bad don't hit my peacock
that's all i ask
lucky
big plays
oh these are big plays
these are some of the biggest plays
you're gonna see oh hello tomo um
would you like to
oh oh it's all coming down man
hey hey buddy you'll see a tail there
you go
hey what are you what are you doing up
there great job peacock i assume
this is huge man
huge
friend bot gain one gold hold on we know
you're getting sold
very nice
i guess we can roll this for now
there's a gold dude an eagle is kind of
sick but what do you get rid of to make
your eagle work
you peel the flamingo
that's what you do
and i guess you roll like an eagle at
the front for the time being
get a gold back roll me
freeze me
freeze me
we're in uh what i would describe as a
delicate position because i have a squad
that does well right now
i don't want to pivot off of this squad
but if i don't pivot off of this squad
we will likely
lose over time
this is unfortunate
my my god we lived
that that garlic armor did insane work
there um so like we're gonna need to
invest in making this better somehow i
but it's hard to see what you get rid of
first to make it happen right
i mean i guess i guess you buy another
goat
if we could get to the point
why not um
where uh a goat
is giving you
two gold for every friend that you buy
then you could start to think about you
know uh
running like a dragon chicken build can
i tell you i do not mind going up
against uh a team that has a snail that
that strikes me as a team that's
you know in economic despair right now
and that bodes well for my chances so i
think this is a little bit of a luck of
the draw by the way desolate housewives
i've been there
i've been down there
running a snail at the front because you
got nothing else to to fit there
they're there but for the grace of god
go eye
we have another can a rhino is always
interesting
i think we're gonna do a can investment
i'm just gonna i'm gonna go loco man
freeze me
freeze me
that's a nine nine man
that's that's crazy
um
you could probably talk about throwing a
turtle in that front position
but i mean the turtle does it really is
a good bat counter i would specifically
i i consider bats like
dangerous enough to warrant that now
this is a scary team the uncertain
pieces you piece
garlic armor is not doing much this is a
loss you just
we're running this is a guy who's well
on his way or a person who's well on
their way to like you know eight or nine
wins i'll settle for being fodder there
the only thing that annoys me is that
they don't know
like this is the meme of the guy at the
party they don't know that i'm not bad
they don't know because their team's so
good they don't know that i'm also good
so peacock's important but i think
the goat makes a little bit more sense
because on
oh
i thought it would work i thought it
would double the amount of gold we got
it just allows us to do it more often
um
i still think we kind of gotta try
i guess i'll run you pretty close to the
front
might as well give you some garlic um
and we're gonna start to
we're probably gonna sell our our swan
is my guess i know that seems busted but
something's got to give we
maybe we could sell the chick but it's a
it's a tight sell let's put it that way
big place
the plays remain large
i think we lose believe it or not just
cause the
the gorilla gets that coconut shield it
shoots in spurts and if it hits it's
gonna hurt by the way
so we're on our last life
that's bad
[Laughter]
obviously um
and we i'm so like concerned
we're gonna get stuck yet again
at this five win marty man for now we
can
like freeze i know we got a goat but
freeze it for a second because we're
trying to see if we got any tier ones
that's fine we buy it we sell it
seven gold roll me again
tier ones this is important you buy it
you get a beautiful buff you get some
gold in return you sell it
now i'm like we gotta i want to buy this
guy
we're at four gold roll freeze me
should have probably bought that first
we can roll one time
freeze me
look
i i do believe in our scaling
i think we might have found ourselves in
winner's bracket though a little too
early i don't know man it's a level
three it's going to become a 39-32
it's dangerous dude
even like peacock is not doing well with
that armor anyway this is a loss
i can't believe it we're stuck
yet again
at five wins
it's
slightly above average but hey thanks
for watching we'll try to get back to
some greatness next time i hope you
enjoyed it if you did click the like
button also the great deal of course
subscribe you want to see more in the
future thanks for watching i'll see you
next time see ya



we're back it's been like four days
since i played super auto pets
i'm eager to be playing
let's do it there have been some changes
by the way i feel like purge gaming i
feel like purge gaming there have been
some balance changes made to super auto
pets let me go over them right now okay
i don't know if they've actually been
pushed out yet
but it's gonna happen
here it comes okay
dodo
now only targets one minion so it
doesn't scale to two minions and then
three minions but it gains a damage
multiplier so instead of a dodo going
wide it can at least go deep on one unit
butterfly copies from the minion with
the most health end attack which i'm
assuming is like a uh
like it's a sum of of attack and uh
and health
bat is now a one two
there are two bat changes specifically
bat is a one two
and week has been changed to give three
extra damage instead of five so they
nerfed the bad stats which is fine like
one three versus one two doesn't change
too too much i think i mean they got the
data
weak giving three extra damage
actually makes like a big difference
because now your
one attack units can't kill a six health
unit just because it has a week applied
to it
was it a response to the tier list many
people are saying this
many people are saying this
now here we go we've already run the
casino
a beetle is acceptable a beaver is
freezable
by the way best change in the in the new
server patch um
the uh
the freeze button no longer
requires a ping to the server
now the most important part of the game
i'll be a flexible swimmer that's fine
by me
ripped to the microbe yeah they saw my
micro builds and they you know they just
said we can't have this we can't have
this
we lose this
this is a loss because they got an ant
club benedict i recognize the name hey
honestly there's no sweat you you run up
against an ant you lose that's just the
way the cookie crumbles um
imo this is a sell me
by me situation nice little 2-4 chilling
around here
um two crickets
we sleep
one pig
we don't sleep and usually here i like i
like to purchase
like
a thing
one second
and then buy some food
you peace
freeze me i forgot how much gold i had
still is a nasty a two four and two two
threes that's a nasty squad
mosquito doesn't scare me two level one
crickets i mean there's daddy don't get
me wrong they got stats not that scary
though
leveling on turn three is most important
oh frick we lose this one too you know
who you're talking to right you're
talking to the meta definer of super
auto pets i invented leveling on turn
three
just like george costanza invented it's
not you it's me
this is a no sweat situation for now
just thinking
maybe we shouldn't have combined
everything unfreeze me roll me
feel like um
still a bat is useful obviously
then i'm gonna be honest you're gonna be
like get that tier three it's a genius
idea
but instead we're actually just gonna
feed this freaking beetle at five hp it
can do some serious work
it can do some serious work
it's still one three not patched yet
look at that because we bought
that meat
we just two for one their tanky beetles
and yet we're still gonna lose
okay
now here we go okay we gotta we gotta
rattle off six wins before our next loss
i'm here to tell you it's not a problem
dromedary's got us stacked up here
already
ladybug gets sold in favor of the
peacock we don't have the resources to
to run this ants
with a pill
two three fish no thank you
pig
very important on the freeze there
dromedary not that important on the
freeze
this is a cella dromedary
by an ants
freeze a pill
roll me freeze me squeeze me this
believers we're not losing this round i
promise you that
we're not losing this round this is the
start
we still get a two for one trade right
off the get-go
turtle does not override weakness which
is nice for us
okay we're gonna
lose no we're gonna we're gonna draw
let's go
good good good
we're in there
okay this and now here we go now we're
starting okay you bat me might as well
do the frozen one
la mommy no thank you
we need to clear space in our shop
because we're about to get another one
poo doll me now we're talking
freeze me
pill me
poodle me
freeze me
roll me like this hey teal teemo
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you for the belief the implicit
belief in my abilities
early blowfish dies in one hit that's
what you like to see
it begins
first win
now we really want to get the scaling
going on our poodle which means we want
to get rid of
um our peacock
in favor of something more useful
interesting
and uh we probably do want to get rid of
our beetle pretty soon
now puppy is just like it's just scary
man it's it's it's only turn six i think
we can probably
i think we can probably make it function
sell me
juice me juice me
i'm gonna be honest for that it's a
weird play for the time being
i think you need a little bit of that
and then you're just gonna freeze me
there we go so now we got a 5-5 out
there
we can't lose
like i mean we can we literally just if
we lose the consequences are terrible on
the garlic let's
go this looks like a draw to me but i'll
take it with our scaling
good land on the weakness good land on
the weakness okay still going that
double caterpillar i'm glad i'm not
facing you later in the game let's just
put it that way
definitely want our poodle to get closer
freeze me a pair for a second
roll me again buy me a poodle
yes
unfreeze my pair
sell
you got to sell the beetle in this
situation
buy me a cow
two four three one five
oh baby
[Laughter]
i think you you you can stack it on the
bat
or you could stack it on the pig
i think the pig's going to scale okay i
think you start let me get let me get
started a little bat let me start a
little puppy as well even though they
got the scaling built in
um i'm look there's a part of me that's
like sell the cow so you get the scaling
um
on the puppy but i think you gotta you
gotta just
let it ride this time and we fed the
puppy some milk instead that's like a
reasonable trade
owns
you can question mark it all you want
here's your question mark
how many points are you gonna lose when
we bust out a six win streak
owned
llama bait good try
everybody makes mistakes you know now we
are going to sell you
donkey donkey donkey we know we want
this a deer is okay
and it would scale but it doesn't
benefit from scaling i think this is a
roll situation
we're unlikely to get to a tier 3 just
being honest that being said a bison
will
get
it's a six six and it will get plus two
plus two
no it won't because our poodle will get
plus two plus two
roll me once more
two four three one
roll me once more
roll me once more
little expensive on the rolls i don't
think anybody would disagree with that
this is a squeeze me
double roll me situation
turtle was we do have a tier three
but a turtle pill is worth holding i
think that was a bad turn basically
we were just fishing for something that
would
fit a little better we never got it
at least the rhino dies in one hit
that one goes out to all the people who
wanted to sell the pig
thanks for the free win
your owns
your owns
you're owned once more
two gold left tell me you don't own the
pay to win expansion pack without
telling me you don't own the pay to win
expansion pack now this is huge now
we're getting back in here
puppy creates a gorilla gorilla is nuts
you get combined
you get bought that's a gimme
now you got you we got to make sure that
you live
that's the scary thing you know you're
gonna freeze a poodle here
i think this is a double roll situation
you can sell pig get to six
roll once and buy one thing
i'm willing to roll once first just to
see where we stand on that
cell pig
it's not the right time it's not you
freeze roll me once and freeze me this
is this is a good freeze this is a hold
the pig i'm just not
i don't believe that the gorilla is
going
to live through the first attack we got
lucky it actually did
we need we need a melon armor on it as
soon as possible dude i'm loving
that coconut shield
his coconut gun shoots in spurts
level two bus is a little nasty but the
puppy runs you
it's a bit spooky on the on the bat here
it's not that spooky
this is a draw
at worst
and we're getting stronger every time
three wins okay here you go
you you absolute even at the cost of our
puppy not getting scaling this time
it must be done
this is the easiest freeze of my life
octopus we've talked about it before
it's not quite there yet
now a bison
instead of a gorilla
is an interesting idea
i think the gorilla can function if
anything i think we're looking for
a tier 5 unit
that we want to scale
the bison will scale but a tier 5 unit
could sail it could scale better
um you getting what plus four plus four
so you're getting plus six plus six okay
i i buy this i buy this it sells for
four
we buy the bison
we roll one time
yeah i believe in this
but oh he doesn't get the buff because
the gorilla gets the buff instead but
that's okay
we got
two 39 43 puppies
three i mean
[Laughter]
with no like augmented garlic armor
that seems like a heavy rip to me wait
the caterpillar is only level one
how did that happen
level one total though
is still a loss
overrides the weakness that's a strong
team
well dude that honestly if we didn't get
stopped at three there
i think we were going like seven or
eight we had such good scaling
had nothing to do with selling the pig
for the bison it's just we ran into a
a nasty team there
just happening we got an injury at a bad
time and it all it all fell apart
okay this we don't get early losses here
when we have an ants it's that simple
you peace
um
that's that's what i meant give me
i'll be the uh i i know i'm gonna be the
miffed kilts though that sounds like a
band you could hear at a fake irish pub
i'm not gonna be the loose housewives
that's that's low-hanging fruit
i'm not gonna be the broken housewives
that's just troubling
this seems like a loss to me
no it seems like a draw because of the
ant
no it seems like a loss
[Laughter]
okay it's just that honestly we ran into
like a bad shop it was just a terrible
like shop although we did have an ant
early which is nice
we're gonna have a pig join the party
we're gonna get a second mosquito we're
gonna roll one time
we're gonna put an apple on the unit
most likely to stick around which is our
pig
then we're going to put our pig at the
back so it's guaranteed to get the ant
buff
kilts are scottish yeah and most of the
people who run irish pubs here are like
you know americans so it's not they
don't make you take a dna test i think
before you
force your serving staff to wear like
tartan and and sell nine dollar pints of
guinness
now this is actually a win
why will pigs stick around
um i
look it's a good cell i would rather
have a fish but now i'm like is slightly
late um
i think i like having one
unit that soaks stats early i don't
necessarily like it being the mosquitoes
i think it looks like this like i think
it's good to have like one
six six seven seven eight eight unit
even if it is a level one you can sell
it back whenever you want to sell it
back too it's not like you you get a
bonus for selling it back early
give me one of these
pill me takes me to
nine
that's
not what i wanted to see
roll
me actually you know what flamingo me
fish me
cupcake
me
i don't want to get big losses early we
want big wins
excuse me your shrimp actually lived
through
an attack
i don't buy it
that's a strong team all right well the
cupcake was a bit of a waste
w-a-a-i-s-t
am i gonna do it i think i'm gonna do it
man
give me one of these
y-w-a-i-s-t
somebody's name
that i shall not uh repeat said yeah
just waste money spelled like uh this
the thing you wear uh your jeans around
good strategy and then i trunked them
and now we're making fun of them
because it feels nice um okay we're
gonna do it give me give me the shrimp
and then we're in full on like buy me
sell me mode
when full-on like swan me
full-on roll me
full-on
sell me
double swan me
i think we might go down here by the way
like
i genuinely would not be surprised to be
at one life after this but we'll see
very similar squad i can't help but
notice
at least we trade here
i mean i don't see how you're coming
through out of this one
okay but this is where we hit the the
gear starts to pog
it's it's just that simple it's an early
caterpillar but not early enough hey
just like a thought like you know what
would be sick is like imagine if we
could create
like a level two unit this is just like
hypothetical or whatever
um
i'm gonna say this is a buy me so we can
combine the stats
maybe that doesn't make a difference now
that i think about it but it's it's a
big buy me sell me as we know
didn't see this one coming so check this
out
sell me
we have to win this round
i'm going in deep
that's so bad
oh this that's terrible man um
and yet
oh
where is it or is it
okay
i know we're not rolling a full squad i
i was banking on my level four unit to
uh be a little bit better than this but
we do we got some stats out here all we
need to do is draw man all we need to do
is drop
that looks like uh that looks like a
draw to me actually it looks like a win
to me i don't believe it
okay look at that two wins
i mean you know we're rolling
i mean just to be straight up with you
um there's a big part of me that's like
sell this guy right here stack me up
baby
[Laughter]
okay hold on
this is this is dumb but great
well that's not worth too much you know
what is a great sell me opportunity
though
to buy me sell me
there we go 613
you have to buy this is the easiest buy
of my life
please no bats
we have an 11 18 swan up at the front
no bats no bad i see a two oh i see a
lot of meats but this doesn't seem that
bad
this doesn't seem that bad
level three shrimp is one of the rarest
achievements
why are people so sleepy on the shrimp
man like it's
it's kind of sick
that's another win for us right there
the shrimp has some plays man i wouldn't
expect you to understand honestly the
chick is kind of good i think this is
like
necessary
i mean i i have to be honest with you
i think you sell the bison
we need to keep you you're kind of like
a bison you have one one yourself and
you pass five five to something with
garlic armor then
you buy an owl
you sell an owl
you get some beautiful stats added up
there
you can laugh all you all you
want okay
you can laugh as hard as you want
shrimp garlic
we're making a scampi
[Laughter]
this is the way
this is the way
oh no i have garlic your scorpion can't
hit through garlic
that beautiful weakness though thank god
hey mcfly those things don't work on
water that's a win baby
scampi meta
we got more bisons we don't care for
them we don't care for them honestly
what we do care for is a big
sell me
roll me
why
because if you don't sell it what's the
point in having the shrimp
you don't you're not thinking creatively
you need to think like emerald lagasse
if you want this run to work okay
you're flat we look at pigs would be
nice or anything that gives us a value
on cell
would be good
so i i don't respect these
i do respect this
i do respect this
you peace him me him him me
um
that's a freeze just in case
i know i'm a doctor too
feel like it's most valuable
this whoever we run into is gonna be
like what the hell did you what did you
do
they're gonna be like what on earth did
you do to create this squad man
you gotta go here i don't even know
where you put the rhino man it's it's so
weird
i don't know
freeze me just in case you're runnable
for sure 13 25 swan
okay
i mean this looks possible
it's a draw
but that's okay
that's very okay because we're only on
four units which is like uh
usually kind of the kiss of death
now i think bat
plus rhino at the front
is how you maybe start to get this off
the ground
hoping that the bat weakens an enemy
in that case though you should
freeze the bed
yeah this makes sense
please me
look i'm not i'm not a full believer
i'm not a full believer but
i feel like maybe we shrimped ourselves
out here
this is this is not great
because of that
but that's okay
this this blowfish is gonna go off a
little
that's what i was worried about but i
think we're still in a good spot none of
the other units really slap a little bit
don't talk about scampi build
shrimp wins
okay so
i do think we're we are buy selling
which means the chick has to go even
though it is amazing for the rhino the i
mean we could sell a swamp but the stats
are too good so you're gonna
buy an owl
you're gonna sell an owl buff my rhino
you piece thank you
we're looking for bibles
and sellables
this this only functions when we here's
my problem with the chicken okay what do
we sell
in order to keep the chicken in the
squad because we only have its effect
while it's active
i don't think there is anything you can
do
i think it's i think it's garbage here
you roll me
buy me roll me
i'm just gonna level with you you're not
gonna like this one
buy me
eat me eat me
sell me for the buff and the extra hp
and then we're going to continue to roll
with a squad that's understated it's
under manned
you anytime you see four units you know
you're in trouble but
or do you or do you
that could be worse it didn't hit our
swan the melon armor is quite nasty or
is it
or is it
the scampi build has paid out the
believers even though we lost three
early on i don't believe it
the four-man win
i mean this is easy mode man this is a
by me
followed by a selmy
dull baby
definitely a freeze me
you kind of don't need a swan
you need like
although it is nice to have that buying
space i don't know why i did it like
that
i i see
this is a buy sell but we don't want to
do it instead we're going to roll two
t-rex's for now
we're going to combine them and give
them some chocolate next time
i'm almost like
i thought about saving a turtle but
big place we need we need melon on our
rhino one way or the other
that's what you don't want to see
it's a leopard
uh
a leopard uh
50 20 dog to start with hey but you know
what
pay out the
believers the scampi build got the job
done
that's you you can't be mad about that
good hustle to to get ourselves out of a
a bit of a jam there run me back one
more
time
oh this is that's money dude look at
that
oh my god my oh my freeze me squeeze me
this is
i mean we got to be the naughty turtles
here this is a a very very strong round
one imagine what our life would look
like if we won the first round instead
of losing it we win this even if our
ants had no buffs attached
that's how strong that is
now if we can get something that scales
early
roll me
don't even need to freeze honestly just
give me uh just give me the bees instead
also made the shop units better for no
reason but
very interesting setup you got here
i don't see this being any worse than a
draw
with with our b at the back that's
beautiful
that's amazing
it's a draw it's not a draw sorry we get
the
we get the b spawn we win again look at
that
why you have no turtles i'm only on tier
one units i gotta we gotta go a step
further here first
so dog builds are a little bit of a
resident snooze
but that being said
while we're here
i suppose i can be persuaded
fish me
freeze me
and me
i respect this
i'm not a sell me by me sort of guy i'm
a i'm a roll me
freeze me
no because we need space for our shop to
grow okay don't freeze the ant that's
fine no you're good you're good you're
good this is good
don't freeze me you're good okay we're
up 2-0 a draw would be fine a draw would
be a-okay
but a win would be sweeter i do see a
tier 3 unit but it's a spider a spider
is a sleeper
that that does stink but it hit a nice
unit
five five fish at the back no ants
buffing you sucks to be you i know it's
true we trade with the spider
we trade with the mosquito and then we
win
via our incredible fish that's three
wins already
kill me
no problem
buy me
combine me
by me
combine me
exist
[Laughter]
the final step is merely existence on
that one but that's okay
sadly not a camel that's that's merely a
dromedary a slightly different situation
still useful four seven rat
hmm stats are good on that rad
i'm hoping that it still allows you
peace i don't get to spawn a b because
of my freaking rat dude it's not even my
rat she doesn't she isn't even supposed
to go here
this still looks pretty good to me
don't buff the rat holy crap
all right it's a draw no wait we win
because it's our red right
thanks for the free points
okay now this now we're talking man
the ant has to go
i would love to get rid of it for a buff
but it's got to go
then you do this
summon me
become me
become
wrath
sell me
we already have four wins dude this is
crazy
[Laughter]
i think now you have uh
an easy step this is gonna well this is
gonna be the next thing to go probably
this is a
chick me garlic me
and this dog is quite spicy early on
here
a 4-4 well you overkill our deer like a
son of a gun there's just some bad news
following that which is i kill your four
or five fish without it doing anything
oops
we do we trade with the turtle which is
totally fine we ruin your melon armor
with a 1-1 b ooh tough luck
and then you got a rat at the back
thanks for the squad
we come over we got free soda we got
free pizza come on over yeah you don't
have to be on that stinky team anymore
don't
freaking talk to me
sell me
scampi me
sell me
buy me
sell me
freeze me roll me
no no no no roll me
buy me
sell me
roll me
sheep me
until i can get my set
not my dog not my dog
hello tomo
he didn't hit my dog let's go okay
uh my sheep
sorry we only got one ram out of it it's
that's the way the cookie crumbles
sometimes you're a piece quite frankly
whatever you're dead how are you how you
gonna punch through this dog man how are
you gonna punch through this dog
can't be done thanks for the win
bro that's six pay out the believers
oh
feels good man
anyway um excuse me
you want to see something funny pill me
sell me
[Laughter]
jesus christ
hold on tomo is tomorrow
tomorrow
you can't be in the chords man
we need to get a squad that scales
further okay so like a spider we can buy
knowing we're likely to sell it later
but it does make the dog better no
matter what
the i mean a buffalo
honestly just fits
because we're
excuse me tomo not in the chords my man
yeah
there you go
you can you can roll a buffalo here it
will mean you're getting rid of like
your your sheep and your deer probably
but
sell me
buy me
likely sell me but just wait one moment
please
[Laughter]
freeze me um
sell me
following that i'm gonna i'm gonna get
you to do a little
there's gonna be some buying and selling
so get ready okay this is a buy i know
you're like why the shrimp instead of
the dog
it's cause you're look you're all about
the you're all about the buys but you
haven't thought about the damn cells yet
okay
this round might be not the best but
this is the necessary regression you
take to get all-you-can-eat shrimp
scampi at red lobster
tomorrow this is getting a little much
okay
it's getting to be a little much
my family's starting to worry about me
this this one's a loss trojan waffle but
um
they got the golden poop headset what
can you say they got a 23-23 ladybug
that's a gamer you know what's up you
know what's up i know what's up you know
what's up that's a sell me
uh
buy me
combine me
buy me
sell me
roll me
buy me
sell me
him him me him me
i'm thinking the bad is the best unit
but this is more fun
buy a pill freeze the spider kill the
spider
get the proc for it being summoned sell
the thing that it creates
we got to combine our shrimp and get one
more good unit out there too
i watch nl for the banter cue it up buy
me sell me ice me freeze me you peace
i mean i i don't see you punching
through the dog too much here so i'm not
sweating it
i think our shrimps are gonna live long
enough to get us the win here
oh baby
that's seven
hello point crow hello
i saw you on twitter
uh
liking the thirst traps that say one
like equals like one head pat and asking
about your day
by what appeared to be a nice young lady
wearing a
like a spandex onesie hey man look don't
let anybody
tell you what you can't do online okay
i'm gonna level with you
i was good i was gonna sell this
caterpillar okay
i kind of feel like i might keep it
be a nice
additional dog
we can always combine these sons of guns
there's no by me selmies here
eagle you know what we can at least put
an eagle out here
it is late i'm not gonna deny the
lateness
i i get it
that you would like but then again what
do we sell in order to make the goat
actually work there's nothing to fit it
there's no fits
i mean straight up i'm like chilly she's
like
i'm telling you
the chick actually benefits us
more than the eagle imo that's the
that's the freeze of the century right
there
that's the second that's this is the
this is the greatest shop you're ever
gonna see in your life i don't even know
if we're gonna have enough money to do
all the things i want to do here
we have to scale
the
caterpillar with experience
faster than we have to level anything
else up
that's for certain nice shrimp nice
shrimp oh a fellow man of taste
ray a golden ray of sun
shrimp a scampi on my plate
prawns a shrimp that's slightly large
and it brings us back to
my cocktail sauce the shrimp a shrimp
shrimp me
you're not a shrimp
are you crazy okay i mean this had to be
done
you can you can function here a little
longer i i like where you're at okay
i like that we can keep the cow out
there a little longer let's let's level
the shrimp up
screw you
you're a piece roll me
might save this for the dog but
we still got the cow for later this is
good this is good man this is good don't
even worry about it
level one turtle i sleep i think
24 24 at the back that's a little nasty
but i'm telling you you only go oh okay
we're probably going to lose this one
we're definitely gonna lose this one but
once our caterpillar pops
we just then
maybe that's where we sell a shrimp to
get a turtle in front of our caterpillar
and then win the game
oh baby
so we can lose our next one and it's
okay that's a sell me
by me
might as well stack the unit that is
the strongest
sell me
buy me fish for a caterpillar
sell me
buy me
freeze me just in case
roll me caterpillar
it's kind of like a caterpillar man
sell me
buy me
max hp me
would you this would be an amazing draw
a draw would do fine here
22 22 is not that scary
we don't live through that just barely
that's that's pain man that's pain
so this is a loss just barely man
but
now we have this that's big that's big
now
sell me
sell me throw it though it pains me
you're gonna sell me
gorilla is a little late
i don't know what the heck we're looking
for
maybe a melon armor a turtle
a turtle would fit
i mean as long as we're buying and
selling i'm a happy man
oh baby
snail me
roll me
so it's not great but you can roll a
deer
and the purpose of it is essentially
melon armor
or not removing melon armor from our
opponents you sell a shrimp scampi
in order to roll a level one turtle in
front of this
very necessary part of the build
that's a double freeze if i've ever seen
one
send me here we go here we go
the caterpillar has a chance remember
this was a big we killed the spider we
got a beautiful caterpillar which we're
hoping turns into a beautiful butterfly
i love that you're wasting
your
steak on a unit that it does not matter
for
it's spiced here it's a bit spiced
get get cracked
get cracked oops my melon armor
nine wins baby we win these
now we have no need for the dog to get
leveled 34 damage is almost certainly
enough
heavy roll me
i've got to remember this is not a buy
sell situation
octopus is a
little late
you know i
garlic's not that good anymore but this
is still the better play in my opinion
now t-rex has some interesting ideas
associated with it but it's it's all or
nothing right now i would rather have a
a level one deer than a t-rex that won't
get a
scaling on this turn
if we draw i would i would stand by that
i think it's it's too late for the
scaling to pop
if anything i'd rather have like an ant
as as busted as that sounds give me a
stake if we draw we want steak on deer
10 12 level 2 turtle
it's a spicy team
the weakness being applied at the start
very bad for business
but
we're gonna get
oh you got your own watermelon armor
this is probably a loss
you peace we were so close
we were so close
still nine wins on a scampi build that's
really good
that's not that's not an f there's no
there's no cause for alarm on that one
that's that's a great win
we'll throw a slash marker in here
sap one



then we're gonna roll it back
start prediction will we get six wins or
more
put me we you know we've been doing some
pay to win put me on some uh oh i was
gonna say put me on some free to play
then i saw a shop that had two ants and
i said nope we will stick with this
because that's very strong
um
i like the idea of a hooting biker
sulking biker is like bikers are already
sulking isn't that like why they're out
on the open road
they're like nobody understands me
and the only way i can express myself is
by using my incredibly loud motorcycle
to
wake people up in a residential
neighborhood at 5 00 a.m
i'd rather if it wouldn't be so bad for
me
if they uh
you know drove around and they were
going whoo sheesh
but the fact that they just drive around
going
i'm like okay i get it you know
you've got a leased motorcycle like
congrats
so
it's nowhere to go but down from there
sheesh
i mean i think you buy this is a just in
case
type buy
a beetle is a is a worthy freeze
a double beetle is is an acceptable play
there's nothing wrong with that
motorcycles are loud so people in cars
can hear them
uh source dude with a modified
harley-davidson motorcycle with a bumper
sticker on the side that says loud pipes
save lives who drives uh down my street
10 times at 4 30 a.m and he's the only
traffic on the street at the moment
it's for safety brother
i wouldn't expect a non-rider to
understand
oops i won
if you had like a silencer you could put
on that at like after 11 pm that
wouldn't be so bad
if you couldn't you just put like a two
liter bottle on the on the end of it
to catch the noise
wrap a bunch of towels around it or
something
um okay
look we look we have a scampi build okay
but we don't have a scampi build we got
a scampi build but we don't have a
scampi build i think you freeze a dog
fish for your level twos come on man
there we go okay so this is the dream
combine me
buy me i'm taking a risk here
buy me
you needed you needed to summon that
man sell me
this is good
squeeze me
freeze me
that could have been better but this is
this is still a good build here this is
a strong build
four six trades with a five seven you
love to see it
we don't do too much trading after that
this is a loss those are some high stat
units
unless
the swan just dies
i mean that's a strong team
you can't be too upset
pill me
acceptable
i'm a
anybody else
god i should call her her in this case
is shrimp scampi
we want a dog at the back now
something like that
um
we wanted you know it is a situation
where honestly you just want to invest
in a unit that's likely to stick around
i apologize for running two dog builds
skipped early camel it's not a camel
it's a dromedary okay
it's two different things
this is uh
this is a tie
due to a beetle or due to a bee no it's
a it's a tie due to the bee lango trio i
recognize you i recognize you
they they want me to roll shrimp scampi
man
they're praying for me to roll shrimp
scampi
nobody wants you to do it okay fine i'll
do it sell me
buy
me
sell me
buy me
combine me
buy me
freeze me
juice me
now we're talking
is a roll of juice there's
a spectrum
rolls juices
freezes squeezes
per chances parties
believes and then
sadly occasionally you do end up being
bereaved from time to time
this is a draw
a merciful draw but a draw nonetheless
i just watched your tier list you're in
this like a league player i have no idea
what's happening but i love it that's
the spirit of auto pets baby that's
where we're
at i got in early enough that i feel
like i can be
good hey old man cyan
thanks for the five gifted subs one for
each sell me juice me
freeze me squeeze me thank you
we bought in early
i missed bitcoin
i missed amazon
i missed the monster energy drink on the
new york stock exchange but i can still
catch super auto pets man i can still k
it's not too late copium
you missed out on the iphone it's true i
didn't miss out on the iphone i suppose
well i i just i didn't believe that the
iphone could make it i didn't think it
could
i didn't see a future in the iphone
personally
ended up not being a great uh
prediction for me but i was also like 19
years old
i think i'm i'm gonna fish here
look
we only have one win that's actually
pretty bad
you have my word next round
we're selling
the fish and then we're selling shrimp
scampi we need to get a little bit we
need to win some rounds quite frankly
and we're not doing that
right now please tell me i lived through
the hatching chick long enough to kill
the bird thank god
never mind i didn't know what i was
talking about
[Laughter]
okay two losses this is bad but it's
okay
sell me
this is a rare exception this is a by me
sell me
you peace
then it's just to sell me sell me now
it's probably a can me
and i think you actually do really well
with like a rooster
now
that got it got a nice buff on it
now you could freeze a sheep
if you don't get anything better
i
i think that's probably where we want to
stay for now
this can work the the rooster is a is a
very very strong unit
insider doubting
rooster in front of dog does make sense
i have a bias towards putting like a
unit that spawns units at the back just
because i'm like this will trick them
i think it makes no difference
whatsoever
actually let me rephrase i think it
makes a difference i think it makes uh
it's worse
either way
look at that
so we're two wins two losses
starting to believe in the in the power
of our scaling here
this is fine
roll me
by me this is temporary cost for
permanent gain you got to go
in favor of an eagle
i'm going to just go ahead and say
we're probably going to can
so let's freeze it i mean buy it
freeze it
don't freeze it roll me
buy me next turn
that's good stuff man that's good stuff
the dog is hard to scale if we're
attached to all our units so we we gotta
recognize that the sheep is probably
gonna go it's not long for this world
bat don't hit my dog you're a piece you
already knew that
level one dragon hey man i'm not going
to complain the stats or the stats are
good look at that
now i don't know if we do better than a
draw oh we definitely do
we definitely do
i won my first latest fire build today i
couldn't imagine what a 20s like so i i
did really well if i may say so myself
a20
watcher took us a bit right
but we got there
then i did a 20 ironclad for the second
time like from zero to 20 on my switch
and it went well
had some had some losses had some wins
then
i've been trying to do it on the silent
i like i can't even get over
uh
a10 like i keep dying
on a10 over and over
dude that's not bad
about 20 wins i hope well yeah
it's probably like 70 rounds but
now i have done it with the silent i
think the silent was the last character
we did it for the first time we uh
we made it through all the ascensions
and and the only time we'll ever make it
through all the ascensions you peace but
we we one shot the gorilla then we trade
with the poodle baby
yummy the dog goes down we ice the skunk
here no sweat
dog gets the kill you love to see it
chick can also buff rooster that's a
great idea
that is a great idea
level three chick is kind of interesting
because i think the plus two plus two is
really nice the experience is great and
then i guess you scale you sell them
later you don't scale them that would be
ridiculous
um let's do this then let's let's try at
least we get stats and you're right i
don't mind mixing it up a little bit
we do want to one-up on you
i think we can instead roll a chili
pepper on you
like you're a hot computer science
professor on ratemyprof.com
now
that's true experience does give plus
one plus one
this is not a buy me sell me anymore
it's a little late for the caterpillar
rhino 1112 rhino
discuss do it honestly
now i'm like buy me sell me
no
11 12 rhino can can function
at that price he can hit you know what
while we're up here why don't you can me
man
i don't know if there is a turkey in the
in the pay to win build
nl skunk is really good source dude just
trust me
this is a horrible team i'm i'm like
horrible for us
it's really bad
we don't even kill the puppy because
it's gonna live via garlic armor but we
might draw
on the strength of our incredible dog
in fact we're actually gonna win
[Laughter]
oh
man
can me if as long as you're winning
we're canning okay
roll me
go ahead and hit me up with a uh with a
melon rhino for now
i'll just treat this as like a defensive
cupcake for now if it if we get a one-up
no we don't want a one-up
melon rhino i think is okay at least
allows us to hit twice on this insane
peacock
that's this is a loss and a half man
congratulations mike ambrose
on your on your victory more power to
you
the only way we punch through this is
the rooster keeps getting buffed and
then
we get a uh
we level it up if we level up the
rooster
we can beat a team like this in the
future
okay
this is this is very important now
rolney
it's not a can-me situation
temporarily we can do this this one's
for the believers we need something like
this
dude i'm going to be honest as much as i
like the melon armor
i kind of feel like you put it on the
rhino to try to kill a unit right now
you know what you know what i like
chat's opinion
try it like that
there's big
big plays if we win this one
please weak white weenie style builds
level two turtle obviously counters what
we got going on but we still have a
tanky squad i'm not like
i'm not insanely upset with what we got
going on here
i would not describe myself as thrilled
i'm not insanely upset
you peace
that's a draw baby
[Laughter]
okay now
it's like i do want to level you uh
this will now by doing that we will
create two chickens because it applies
at the end of this turn
roll me
honestly roll me buff me
excuse me excuse me
it doesn't start it says end the turn oh
it started turn it changed
and i rolled past the rooster
rip my points
well no rip uh rip your points
my points are safe and secure
we
we still would have lost against this
squad
just running it forward
you know one extra chick with like 15
attack punches the melon armor we still
lose but
obviously it leaves a bad taste in your
mouth
and we run it back will anal get six
wins or more
should have gone back to the free to
play this you know what i see i see a a
bad
shop i say whoops let's go back
excuse me
that's a great shop we're going to
abandon that take take me back to free
to play please
as the developer of the game i
will implement a change soon to make it
so that um when you hit play arena it
asks you which one you want to play
first oh baby whoa would you look at
this
i believe in the power of ducks
maybe a gushing bell tower
and first
that's where you're wrong
i i i place an ant
so that it deal okay well you know what
we're going to draw i place an ant so it
deliberately targets my strongest unit
whenever possible
i don't know if it if it actually
changes things that much but
it feels nice for me
there's plays to be made here okay it
looks like this
it looks like this
you roll me
you chill you chill me
we put you here
next turn we're hoping for a fish to
show up in the shop okay we buy the fish
come combine
sell both ducks all of a sudden we've
got a tier three unit on round three
that might be like a six six
all we need to see is a fish in our shop
this is pretty bad
this is not great
but you know what now that i look at it
i think we draw thanks to our bee doing
one damage fish in the shop please fish
in the shop
i'm rolling
okay it makes the it's still insanely
good for dodo
i know you're like what about what about
the shrimp
[Laughter]
hold the front door okay hold the hole
the front door
buy me
sell me
buff me
freeze me
because what if we got another duck
sell me
roll me
roll me
by me
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah rad
is op early game it's so it's one of the
easiest ways to uh it's one of the most
op ways to uh
give your opponent a free victory i
would tend to agree with you
you peace
melon armor piece
i see you also have a strong dodo what's
up with that
i ain't scared
okay okay you got me your dodo is better
than mine but don't care didn't ask plus
you're a guest
roll me pill me
be smart combine me
kill me
buy me
buy me
sell me
oh no he's doing it oh no oh no
collusion no collusion
no collusion
please we need a dub here we need a dub
here
four seven this looks okay i don't see
any level twos
our our seven piece so it's not gonna
live as well you know what it'll live
long enough to do one of those
then it'll kill the turtle you're a
spider don't care didn't ask plus you're
a spider
level two cricket like i said no level
twos that matter
ox that has no benefit associated with
it gets smoked we win
we
win scampi build
me
buy me
not good enough not good enough
it's not good enough
an ox is very interesting though like a
combine me
place
me roll me
by me i mean your base you're like i'm
you're a you're a mammoth right now
you're like an early mammoth
it's kind of weird
probably should move it so it's not
there huh
that's a good point i don't know where
to put it though
that shrimp is gonna eat it though
when our dodo hits level two which is
inevitable
um then then life will be a little bit
easier for us
okay
this is a win man
guaranteed
look at this
sick sick shrimp
eat
it okay this is the dream now it's that
simple
so
you buy me
we still probably want a dodo the whale
is going to eat the flamingo
i think you're getting sold i'm sorry to
tell you
and then you're probably getting sold
this still looks right
you piece
sell shrimp you peace
it actually is the next to go i just
don't have anything i love replacing it
with right now
you're literally insane enjoy an insane
victory
oh crap 11 12 badger
they're going full on badger bill
this seems okay because i have melon
armor
temporarily
okay
dodo is your time to shine oh frick
that's a that's a new meta front badger
man with a monkey buff
what are we at
that's that's one loss
two losses i clicked through a little
quick there um
okay okay this is a can me
sell me
kangaroo me the problem is now the ox
has very limited reason to exist even if
we do buff it i guess if the kangaroo
gets some buffs there could be a benefit
associated there
this doesn't matter too much i would
freeze me
roll freeze me
roll me
dude you gotta try
roll me
freeze me
easy incoming win
level one turtle i sleep
oh crap never mind i don't sleep i
forgot we eat our flamingo and then spit
it out with worse stats that's okay
kangaroos popping man look at this
nice level one melon armor
oh wait no it isn't is sorry it's you're
probably a viewer
don't care didn't ask plus my dodo lives
don't care didn't ask
my kangaroo beats your kangaroo
well this is bad
although
it's actually a draw okay
it's okay one of these that's big roll
me
it's it's just sadly not the right build
but it is only turn eight you know what
the time has come for a legendary pivot
come on
that's a that's an easy buy for future
purposes
that's an easy buy
so
the dodo's not part of our build anymore
we gotta we gotta start to unwind our
existing deck
we love the the the spam here though
like look at look at that stat spam man
this crazy town you're a 7-1 you're a
9-1
nice buff
there are flamingo's coming back out
it's a 6'4 your cricket eats it you love
to see it you love to see it
bunch of bees
not sweating
not sweating okay admittedly i start to
sweat this slightly just because it's
annoying
you got me on that one congrats
we actually lose this one by one hp
instead of a draw
you hate to see it okay
your boy jay you you put me on lethal
here
i can't believe it i was talking kind of
a big game there
the can must be purchased
the dodo must be killed
a rooster
will get played
in front of the whale
for now
just for now
you don't need garlic on you that's for
certain
roll me
freeze me
roll me
i like this game's
supposition
let's go that a sushi is actually just a
strictly better salad
deer
this ain't a deer build man
get ready
nice four four wow that's pretty spicy
uh too bad it loses to my 14 four it's
not as much as i thought shark scares me
a little okay
look it get owned
continue to get owns i spit out another
chicken that's that turtle's pretty bad
for me i'm not gonna deny that okay but
we do live through that which means we
do get to land and attack nicely here
chicken comes out kills the cricket you
love to see it you summon a two-two that
we're gonna lose to this shark man
there's no way we we make it through
this shark are you kidding me
it's not it's not sensible
we got three more units coming out here
it can't be done
every unit that faints just makes him
that much stronger
we're doing 21 damage hold on we might
draw
this one goes out to saucer king 11 who
says thanks for the points believers
the draw has happened
now we got to rethink our positioning
it's all screwed up uh-huh
you gotta sell the flamingo
i'm not even looking to chat cause i
know they're gonna crap their pants over
that one
which is very fair
a shark has to come out okay hold on
you're probably gonna sell a kangaroo
too you just gotta think about it the
shark must exist
this has to happen
you're gonna sell me
freeze me
exclusively
for the time being you're going to sell
me
you're going to go here
or
are you gonna no i i like this i like
this
though this would create two chicks
that would be
nineteen seven
or get plus four plus two on each death
with no garlic
what can you say
best of luck
i just want you to know
we're all counting on you
great start great start
still a great start
we knew that was coming we don't sweat
that oh a bee so scary
just kidding owned
owned
owned you're gonna own me for a little
bit here but hey this might be a draw
no it's an easy win
[Laughter]
never mind
okay where the heck are we gonna put you
here
never should have sold whale tell me you
averaged two wins
without telling me you averaged two wins
let me let me here's your squad
hedgehog at the back with a b on him
they'll never see that one coming
following that
i'm gonna guess you probably got like a
six six fish
right after that you got a peacock
that's a one six then you've got a whale
then you've got a deer and you're like
it's incredible because the deer gets
killed by the whale then it spits out a
fire oh but the five five um
bus just got one tapped and it did like
a quarter of the damage to two units but
then then the whale did two damage and
then it got one tap but then spit out
the deer that did one
damage
which is pretty much negligible but then
it spit out another five five bus and
that finally got the first unit killed
and then their third unit just runs over
you
um
and then you go it's probably pay to win
then you buy the expansion pack you
start running into bats bats bats bats
bats bats bats and then you're like
it's the ballot we need a balance patch
immediately
okay hold on
roll me
do not wail me don't even talk to me
about the parrot
is the sleeper of the century this is
necessary
this is necessary
this is necessary
i rerolled the fly
i choose not to let that information
into my brain
although the only thing i would say is
oh here we go here we go if we didn't
reroll the fly where do we put it like
what do we get we get rid of the hippo
obviously but how do we
how do we put our units in order to make
that actually function properly
you piece
get rid of shark
uh
how about nose scott
like they have a horse
we have a tiger
right now is not necessarily working out
that i think we win this man for all the
people who are like this is a loss
um wait i forgot that all of these units
will also summon incredibly strong flies
no this is definitely a loss i don't
know what i was thinking
every creature that comes out also
summons like a nine nine fly afterwards
all right relax so nice meta build
you pay out the doubters on that one you
got me you got me
dude i keep losing all my points
believing this sucks
i just paid out the believers
two games in a row
like 20 minutes ago doesn't make any
sense
i'm just you can be mad that you suck at
betting but
yeah but i doubt it then
then the first sentence was a lie
yeah but i bet i believed then and
doubled up but then i went all in on
belief and i lost if you go all in
you only need one loss to lose
everything
that's why you you need bankroll
management
okay hold on slash marker
sap two
donkey



chunky Chip have you played this yet
there's still time okay I know you're
you're looking at it and you're looking
at the graph and you're like it's too
late for me to get on the rocket ship
nah man it's still early
I asked my chat if I should play it and
they called me stupid
that doesn't sound like your Chad that
sounds like much
hold on hold on
it doesn't sound like you're a chat chip
I'm just going to be honest I think you
have out of all these units though I
hate them I think you have to roll horse
which is kind of like
an order problem but so be it
I mean you got to be the squeaky pieces
right
I think this is a I would say this is a
round one likely loss unless we run into
a fellow cursed player
this this actually could be totally fine
duck and pig are both like uh you know
those are future proof
we actually win holy crap
a friend of mine told me today that
you're bad at this game is that true NL
I didn't know that uh
Middle School cafeterias were open
during covid
was this like a zoom luncheon or
something
I thought I thought they had all you
guys like eaten at your desks in the
classrooms
two meters supposedly two meters away
actually more like you know 55
centimeters
okay hold on you can roll
I love a fish okay
I think this is not a fish play though
simply because we already have a horse
I think you can freeze a fish
temporarily roll once
fish for something that would level up
if you don't get it then it's very
simple you just put a b attached to that
ant
in order to get some six summons
well we trade with the fish they also
got a they've got the same build but
better this is probably a loss
if I had the guess this is a loss
if I had to guess this is a draw
hey oh
now
hey the bee took us from A Loss to a
draw I'm never going to insult it
we really we got some okay so I'm
guess get sold
get bought
get Frozen
get unfrozen
get Frozen you know what actually check
this out
um poggy
then we can sell it back later
also known as buy me sell me meta
get Frozen don't you mean freeze me oh
yeah yeah
sorry I meant to say freeze me
honestly
sell me
buy me
even without a scampi I'm a Believer in
The Meta
you're a piece on just straight up
you're a piece
take it or leave it
there's nothing wrong with being a piece
if you're like if you're okay with that
then give me one of those give me one of
these uh no don't give me one of those
don't give me one of these okay
yeah I don't know what happens if you
level up a bee I guess it would be so
hard to even get it to level two because
you'd have to put honey on something
kill it with a pill and then combine it
two times but I suppose it's a
theoretical possibility
foreign
this is a loss we knew this was coming
though this is like the necessary step
but because we didn't get a tier three
unit So you you're kind of placed at a
disadvantage here
now though
you do a simple combine me
you do a simple
you know what you don't combine the
horses yet you do something like this
you sell me
you should have done this in a different
order
you're by me
now we're talking you roll me you roll
me
I'm going to resist the temptation to
run shrimp scampi build here
I love to see a four five that loses to
a five five
they they've built their team to get
money and then uh draws unfortunately
I'm here to tell you I don't think
that's how it's going to work today
too late for dog build it's round four I
think we're I think we're fine man
especially if we keep running into
Charles Dickens build
wow wasn't even close
ref I gotta say it okay it's merely okay
you peace
it is a buff
like there's something to be said about
that
you know
he hates pure stats early on I was
talking about how useful your stance
abilities can be but this is fun this
this is a good one okay oh oh here we go
it's it's the chat build
Cricket whale Ox peacock horse
just you might as well just hand me my
free Victory right now
this is somebody who's way behind on the
vods they don't even they don't know
Wall Street builds meta they don't know
shrimp scampi meta
you also have two horses and a dog
um yeah I suppose that's true isn't it
quite indubitably
don't kill me oh you you're a piece well
we are going to lose this one I don't
know how that happened
hmm
um
we you don't like to see a loss to
somebody who has garlic on an ox like
that's that's bad for your self-esteem
we need another real unit and it's not
going to be shrimp scampi I'll tell you
that much that's the good stuff right
there
eating good in the neighborhood
oh baby we do have a problem though
um we can't really combine them yet
I love a turtle just like that's free
Mount well it's expensive Mountain Armor
but melon armor nonetheless
this could work man this is this is a
build just don't run into hippos no
hippos please
how'd you get a tier V unit this early
you Swan Lord you Swan Lord
foreign
this looks like a loss
it only costs one more gold than a
regular melon yes it costs one more gold
than a regular melon but it also shows
up way early you know it's like if you
were if you lived in uh the U.S Civil
War
you might pay like you know your
country's entire GDP
Lucky Draw in order to get like one
Hellfire missile you'd be like oh you
really want a money-saving strategy why
don't you just like wait 200 years you
can get them for fifty thousand dollars
yeah but it's not worth as much in the
future
if I had one in the Civil War I could
just drop it on like General E Lee's
Outhouse and and end it in one go you
know the earlier you get
some units in this game the more
valuable they are
oh
what did I tell you
what did I tell you
you piece here's the thing you're a
piece
that's a piece right there
oh excuse me
I mean I think you keep rolling the
cricket quite frankly I thought about
the turtle
I think he's it this is pretty good as
is you can you can sell it
we'll just we'll keep it around for the
time being you know what do you think
about that just keep it around for the
time being
unfreeze it
um
I don't think I will
yo you know it's actually kind of a
genius strategy what about what about
this
five five guess what
now you're a seven five
that doesn't spawn anything when you die
oh hello
I don't know how it happened
hello honey
I believed in this man get ready we're
going up against another chat build
level two giraffe also known as free
victories for me
get ready for this this is this is where
you doubted and this is where I win
7-7 get on 9-7 get owned
owned
you're lucky that kangaroo gets two
Buffs
easiest own of my life it actually gets
many more than two we're probably gonna
lose this one
all right
but then we'll just win from this point
onwards because we got scaling why do it
to the cricket I'm gonna be honest with
you okay Iran Burgundy a little bit
someone in chat said pill the cricket
and I said that seems like a great idea
easy place easy place easy place
build me roll me
we're getting close to the point where
we don't need a horse okay I'm not
pilling the deer that's a doubter
strategy
squeeze me pill the dog it's a doubter
strategy
doubter you hear that doubter sell me
this is not a good idea what am I doing
maybe it's okay eight five deer
buy the pill sell the pill that's kind
of legit good play yeah yeah yeah oh no
my dear
oh whatever
sucks anyway
oh oh
splash him
damn I don't think that peacock's gonna
get strong enough man oh
crocodile gets owns dead dead crocodile
says what
can you show a chat you know how to clap
game with my hands clap
hey
oh honey would you give me a kiss
I think that counts I think I think that
was an attempt thank you
you're welcome
her
okay
the snail's gotta go that's a gimme
the can must be purchased
the the rooster must be purchased
the the this should be Frozen and
possibly fed to the dog not IRL
it's very bad for them
but you know I don't even don't let Chad
look at that they love the snake too
much
please
hi honey
oh uh it's a four Squad build what's
happening
are you okay
oh
cool okay melon armor
chat bills
big whoop
this is where the the pure pwnage starts
level to level two
Blowfish is not great but it the garlic
armor soaks it pretty good
well it doesn't even bother me man
doesn't even bother me
now here's the part where you get owned
and then we turn it around on your right
here oops
back to backsu for Daddy please thank
you
roll me
is it too late to roll shrimp scampi
it's not a whale build unfortunately
although
nevertheless
foreign
we gotta we got a squad man we got a
squad
you would be like selling a deer to make
another deer at some point I'll do
I'm doing it
why is the pear Frozen
tastes better that way now you get
buffed
you get rolled
you get Frozen
you get rolled
this is okay we can sell the cow
freeze me roll me buy a turtle a
turtle's okay
freeze me we should have Frozen the pill
probably too this is okay
please please
why did he get rid of deer don't at me
dear good unit also most overrated unit
in the game okay this hippo is gonna run
freaking wild on us
no it's not it's good no it's no oh
please
it's not gonna run that Wild on us
it's only gonna kill my first three
units
that's all right it purges the melon
armor might have accidentally worked out
in our
oh no because you got it back okay well
that's fine I still think it might have
worked out in our favor nice build get
owned
easy win hey
an anonymous gifter I don't know who you
are where you're from what you did as
long as you subbed me thank you much
appreciated
okay this forget pilling the turtle
now we're thrilling the turtle
I'm going to be honest I think it's one
of these
and I think it's one of those
there was a dog in the shop
he's a Sleeper Man
we're in a win now mode
it's a bit spooky
sorry we don't care for our sheep that's
all you peace but easy easy piece except
we live because of our turkey
oh baby that's a win this is a win
stake giraffe at the front it is it's a
bold move to put a unit that Buffs units
that are in front of it at the very
front
ladies and gentlemen the uh
the Believers have won again hope you
win all in that time let me guess no
that I already lost my points on the
last one
sad
now let me tell you something okay this
might surprise you turkey one up is good
Tech in case it gets sniped
I'm very eager to get you to level two
I'm very eager to realize that this
doesn't apply really to anybody but our
Turtle so let's not freeze it
I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of Statin
you I'm not I'm not against a melon
armor on the turtle that creates melon
armor but
listen you peace I always believe I
always go at least 80 percent in
that that can't be a good strategy long
term
what the heck is this squad am I am I
getting meta-gamed right now
what is this
they had they moved their bus like one
back to protect it from anti-bus
technology itself
you peace
well this is a loss
wow that's a strong hippo
I lived
I died hey though Believers look at that
the Believers get paid out once more
I don't know what we we needed a
scorpion up at the front basically to
win that one
start my prediction again run it back
we've had a good believer to doubter
coefficient here
uh one of sheep could have been a
workable move there for sure all right
so I'm basically oh what the hell is
this man
the hell is this don't
either wet noses
this is a terrible start this is like
we're starting a loss down
oh my God
yeah we lose we lose to a uh oh no you
know what we actually draw because of
the 50 50 going in our favor what a
dream
okay you got you gotta work with me here
okay
I'm I'm gonna because we drew
I'm gonna do something you're probably
not gonna be a huge fan of
I'm gonna Double Down
I think we can take a fish we we need
something that has some stats
next turn we try to get to that tier
three then we sell sell sell Scamp me
Scamp me
by all accounts this should be a loss
we're going up against essentially a
meta build well maybe not meta but at
least it has it has a synergy
that's fine we knew this one was like a
loss
yeah this 50 50 fish by turn 10
guaranteed
he's not a piece well maybe a little
we needed a beaver we saw a beaver
well you know what to be honest we
hold on let me think okay let me think
for a second
combine me seven gold
buy me
four gold

surplus of one gold
now six seven swan
Don't Mind If I Do
sell me
well
buy me
roll me
freeze me
we're about to have two of the strongest
units you're ever going to see

whatever we traded no sweat just don't
lose that we we can't lose this one it's
a it's a big problem
that's fine as long as you don't get HP
[Laughter]
I knew it I knew it I knew it okay one
one nothing wrong with that man there's
nothing wrong with a one one then watch
this oh baby seven seven Beaver okay now

spider

even think you roll peacock I think you
just rolled camel into like incredible
swan
sell me
buy me freeze me
roll me
not bad

situation look at this oh my God oh my
God
this is not bad in the slightest man
it's gonna be Beaver V dog and we're
gonna win easily
it really it does want me to take the
peacock but too bad
I'm off on my I'm on my own wave right
now
I don't know if we should try to make a
beaver get even stronger
although it is a nice sell late like you
don't feel as bad about getting that
late sell
I'm I'm loco man I'd love to keep you
around for stats dude honestly I know
that's crazy talk but you know what I'm
a bit of a crazy guy
I'm a bit of a crazy guy I'm Gonna Roll
a four Squad right now
if you got a problem with it

camel already has the melon it doesn't
deserve it we'll just we'll keep it like
that for now
I'm so crazy talk is just like talk to
me
unfreeze elephant well it's still got
stats let's not throw the dang baby out
with the bathwater man
what is this build I'm so anytime I see
fuss pots
I know I'm going up against somebody who
has like uh
a PhD and
theoretical
combinatorics and I say to myself this
is not good for me and yet I also say to
myself
appears my swan has been owning you
thusly
that's the dream buff
get owned
we win again
almost had me
almost had me
RNG
oh but look at this look at this though
holy crap
um
sell me
buy me what happens if you combine
snails
only one way to find out
what
I mean it's still I mean I'm not going
to cry about it 86 snail man
unfreeze me
you got to do it on the level up
nevertheless I mean that's still pretty
good I would love to see like uh like a
poodle now
oh we're feasting we're feasting
thanks for not taking my melon armor oh
sorry you died
oh sorry your strongest unit got uh
eaten by melon armor oh sorry you uh
missed I was gonna say lethaling Me by
one but I was looking at the wrong stuff
that's fine you're still owned thanks
for the free win
foreign
buffer
this is a no-brainer
are we really you look okay for now sure
for now for you for sure
for sure
freeze me
it's the same art
what's up with that
can me
they're all emojis you're an emoji
ever consider that
you cannot defe they can't resist us Mr
Powers you can't resist us Mr Powers
nice attempt
flapping bits Beavis and Butthead Emoji
it's pretty good that's pretty good
that's some pretty good stuff there
well this is a big buff
on a Dodo we love to see that
whoa that's the wrong button
yeah yeah yeah yeah now we're talking
honestly if you if you're gonna be like
a a-hole like this then sure eat one of
these eat up yummy yummy
two messages back to back dodo so
overrated dodo top tier No Cap this is
the same individual man
too bad uh I'm better
um in some ways wait this might be bad
no I think our Beaver could do it
I think our Beaver leads us to the
promised dramas land
thank you beaver and a draw is a huge
win because we're scaling
Leave it to Beaver great episode title
name great episode title name
Beaver could use some garlic or we could
sell them to get some stats rolling in
the future
I'm a I'm a Believer in Rolling for cans
okay you gotta you gotta play monkey
and I think you play it at the expense
of your giraffe
so sell me buy me
buy me buy me sell me now we might get
another cow so for now just freeze me
you see that fonker
buy me
build me
build me sell me
Freeze Me freeze me holy
[Laughter]
four piece
me
we're rolling a four-man Marty here
you gotta leave your beaver some room to
breathe
okay early shark scares the the bejesus
out of me but it's only a level one
horse but man that shark is going to be
Mighty strong
our garlic Swan is gonna eat them up
with some fava beans and a nice Chianti
that Ox is just pure luck what can you
say just like no shot no shot
as long as we live long enough to kill
the shark
that's all that matters man
ambitious of you to put anything on the
docket after Super Auto pets it's
actually like I'm not expecting
especially with the salary leaks I'm not
expecting anybody to be like sympathetic
to this but it's like I could play
another hour of Super Auto pets or there
is a beautiful Timber uh timber-born
Bounty a city Builder that's good with a
bounty associated with it oh
how how bad do you want to play more
Super Auto pets though
pretty bad to be honest with you
it's a tough it's a tough one man
I'll probably play Timber board not just
for the Bounty I did want to check it
out at some point anyway then Super Auto
pets sucked up all my time and then they
were like here's a bounty and I was like
you have my attention now okay
this is the thinking man's Gambit you
definitely start here
I sleep
this is really good there's two lines
okay there's monkey buffing camel or
Dragon cell Beaver roll for tier one's
Buy sell buy me sell me buy me sell me
or rooster
getting a little slice of the dodo
and you know what after everything we've
been through
I think you sell Beaver it's very rarely
had to attack anyway
we finally get that buff you buy monkey
you buy rooster
you get
Hannah Montana The Best of Both Worlds
it's not a shark build really
I'll take that
we're on turn 10
with a middling build but a build oh
yeah sorry sorry dodo is supposed to be
buffing my rooster my mistake
oh nice 17 damage just kidding
hey nice uh bus uh just kidding hey you
gotta it's quite the rooster there be
ashamed for just kidding
you gotta it's a very similar build you
got here
is gonna be tight
I think I think we draw
because of the garlic armor
oh wait well we dry anyway but
very famous quote from Derek Zoolander I
can derelict my own balls of course
um we want to do it like this probably
although I do we it's just it's very
simple we need the dodo
I don't know we need the dodo to get
to level three for now I can live with
this
maybe it's fine you are a 14 15. that's
pretty good
I'm rolling past the camel for now like
we're fishing for
bigger and better things let's go
one up doesn't matter too much here
melon
sure
that's in the service of you getting
stronger in the future
you can freeze me a pizza
it's just sweet and pizza by the way
okay
why not Brewster is good I mean it comes
back as a one one
so
it gets killed it spawns an 8-1 and a
one one and then one of the one ones
when it dies becomes uh
a one one
is actually a little whack if I dare say
so myself
you're a piece
it's all right that's that's why you put
that armor out there
that's a win right there
that's a Believer payout would you would
you believe it you better believe it
yummy yummy
I think you put it on the dodo you gotta
get a better efficacy on the dodo
oh dude
okay
yeah okay I could see camel buffing
rooster also makes sense
very lucky with our hippo here
your kangaroos is gonna get strong it's
not gonna get that strong
it is going to get exactly strong enough
to kill us
snake kills monkey irrelevant I say it
again irrelevant
I do not fear your chicken built
as we have our own chicken built and
this is yet another win
move me roll me we don't buy apples at
this stage of the game we don't you know
what actually some garlic could could
function it's all about incremental
benefits when we get the chance
I I know I said I was looking for
something a little different
that that's a play right there
we're gonna try we're gonna invest
it's not the best Squad I've ever had
but it's it's something
very similar T level three though
there's a level three team with a one-up
flamingo very scary very scary
although dude oh dirty we still we still
do it we still live we live long enough
to not die and then to hit you again
which will kill the camel which will
bring back a 33-1 which will kill the
dodo and we win
let's go
you sell the monkey
you buy a tiger
The Roosters are out of control and you
can roll this two different ways man you
could roll four roosters well no you
can't okay this is the way it should be
never mind I apologize for getting a
little bit ahead of myself
I will try to get to a level three dodo
it speaks to me
get buffed honestly you're already
basically maxed you should you should
get buffed
freeze me
[Laughter]
is this gonna be your game of the year
it is right now honestly it is
I and nothing else is like like
WarioWare was a lot of fun but like
people can laugh at it all you want you
know
it just shows how how gatekeeping the
internet can be sometimes oh it's it
can't be your game of the year it's not
a Metroid yeah get over yourself here's
your Metroid
this is a win baby
still with level one swan baby
I don't worry about the significance
within the industry of the game that I
give game of the year to
if it's my favorite game while I used to
but if it's my favorite game of the year
congrats here's your game of the year
award
sushi
yummy yummy
honestly you're gonna laugh I think we
get get ready to put a b at the back
just in case
oh pog
what about repentance it's great I'm
just like
I I have entered a period in Isaac where
I'm like
I am happy to not be playing it on the
stream anymore I'm I'm happy to be
having a little tolerance break from it
for the time being
Super Auto pets your music saved me
this is still a win
is so good dude wait is that 10. oh
I'm a little surprised but hey man level
two dodo tiger let's enshrine them level
one tiger obviously
level two dodo rooster Swan and camel
oh baby
who would have thought well let's put a
slash marker there



hey everybody we are back
white hoodie tells you three things by
the way one is
Jay wolves in my door amazing designer
number two is the same day as the
previous videos number three it's
getting a little chilly outside
when it's chilly I don't make the rules
you play free to play animals to try to
break our our drought of merely doing
pretty well
but not doing amazing so you you invest
in
future wins here this is this is the
dream you get a fish the fish becomes a
three four I don't make the rules that
means it easily wins the game
um
I think what if you ran your strong unit
at the front you ever think about that
what about the the Milky the Milky eyes
milky eyes they're watching you they see
your ever removed
you guys you guys like Hall and Oates
yeah okay
that that might make a difference right
there by the way
that's a win look at that didn't even
have to use our otter which is great
because our otter is a one too that has
already served its uh purpose
um
this is the way you run the deck is
basically thusly you know you you buy
two horses for early game uh victory
points
we freeze you we roll you
we duck we freeze we unfreeze
these are these are Big potential plays
here don't combine roll me one more time
freeze me again I would not mind rolling
a level two and a level one horse here
early on we want to be careful not to
get shoehorned into the horse build for
life but go ahead shoot my horses see if
I care
you shot my mosquito oh wait a minute
hey look at that though look at the
trade we get as a result of that
um this is a loss though
you just got a better Squad I can't
really be upset
it's just a better team there
um but tier three is where like our
units can really start to shine
you're gonna do this first okay then
you're gonna
cell
so that your bi or you're really so the
duck gets stronger
um
I'm not sold on these I I wish that I
were I sincerely do
um I think you definitely do roll a
cricket I think you freeze a swan
for when your horses get combined you're
definitely going to dump a mosquito
um a Dodo is good enough in my world to
at least hold pig is interesting now too
because we can basically make a 6'3 Pig
and and it'll cost us three but then
sell it back for two on the next turn
shoot the cricket please
you peace sorry we we don't really care
if our mosquito gets traded like it
makes no difference
um we're gonna lose again
not a great start we we need more stats
okay
we're losing in the stats Department
right here go go ahead run me
see if I care
we're one win two losses all I'd say
about this for the time being is that it
looks worse than it is
I think you can you buy a duck honestly
to like sell a duck
which makes your dodo that much stronger
for the future
roll me one time
you peace
I think we've come to the point where we
we benefit more from stats than anything
else
um
honestly I think you roll Swan up at the
front
and then a little dodo just just like
chilling behind
I think you sell this and and buy this
and it's
is that of no great pleasure but we need
to start picking up some wins a little
little 10-5 swan up at the front against
the 3-4
dodo at the back I I see the problems
here
um I'm very scared of what this peacock
can do to our uh our fairly weak Squad
I think we lose this one
well this is a big hit well no it's not
really
it's like exactly not enough
this is a disaster I don't know what
else to say
where are we at one win three losses
one win too low one win one win three
losses my my word
okay sell me giraffe has some plays man
a giraffe buffing a dodo
giraffe that's the sound that a giraffe
makes I had no idea
um
selling a horse because the squad just
doesn't work you know better better to
get out of it as soon as possible I
think
I guess we should have not sold the
horse before we yeah okay fair enough
but
I'm thinking this is important Maybe not
immediately but
soon
um
giraffe giraffe
freeze well there's no point in freezing
that I would say
okay
um this is a weird build this is like
desperation
I see an 812 whale a level two horse and
a dog
and I say to myself you know what this
is probably
a a guaranteed loss
I don't know how we would get out of
this I mean this is look the free to
play Gamers on on a Canadian long
weekend here they're really bring in
their a game
um we just got bodied that went nowhere
man
okay don't even give me my points I
don't want them I don't need them
now this is a squad now this is a squad
look at this
look at this
look at this roll me
that's a good freeze that dude we could
deliberately
throw a couple rounds
I got uncertain ABS that's fine
um
we could throw a couple rounds which
seems pretty spicy but to be able to
sell
two or three ducks and then just like
you know ball out statistically speaking
is a dream come true we knew this was
probably a loss
you know the duck is a one-two it's not
uh it's not the strongest unit in the
game
now if we're gonna buy you we do it
right away
that's fine
I think
we throw this around
don't combine just just move please just
move it's hard it's hard whatever I'm
gonna I'm gonna accept that
I'm going to freeze a pig
no okay now I'm gonna unfreeze I'm gonna
freeze a fish because the fish will be
five six next turn after we sell our
ducks so I expect to lose this one too
that's not really a big deal honestly
yeah I don't expect to win this one
I can tell you that we will not be
winning this one but we have set
ourselves up for for a situation where I
will not be happy unless I get like
three or four consecutive wins here
based on the way that we did this okay
so sell me
sell me
sell me
now you're gonna you're gonna shove a
six four out there you're going to shove
a five six out there
I Think You're Gonna Roll a a six five
hedgehog at the back we're not gonna
peacock or pill this guy right now
peacock just for for two at his timing
um
I think we're gonna sell our horse
now sell sell the otter for now
because you can still get a buff on your
peacock for the time being
roll me one more time
we know a cell is incoming okay
so this is this is the duck Gambit we
want to see a three attack or less at
the front
sounds good to me I would well don't
shoot my front unit please thank you
that literally doesn't matter
probably the best thing that could have
happened
we Crush you
we crushed you yeah we trade but
we Crush you
now at some point this Hedgehog is not
going to be sticking around but that
point is not yet
there's a part of me it's like you buy
you buy into it but
for now why don't you why don't you
freeze me why don't you roll me
you peace
if we're gonna do it we should have done
it earlier you know what there you go
now we get a whale this is nice we sell
you we have our whale it's gonna screw
up the stats something fierce here
but ah we need the peacock to move up
one so it gets hit by the Buffs of the
peak of the of the flamingo
but we see three at the front don't
don't shoot my front line unit please
big whoop
whatever our fish is going to be
incredible
love it
listed
our peacock is gonna get hit by the
second buff at least so there's
something there I guess
this looks okay
in fact it looks a lot better than okay
look at that so is that what the crunchy
pieces is it are two wins that we asked
for for throwing two runs away early
now a duck I think is a little late
um I think the time is the fish is good
okay it's time to sell it
in order to unhurt give friend behind
plush
one plus two the camel peacock Synergy
is really good
but how do you ensure that the camel
gets hurt but doesn't die similarly you
look at an ox okay
you can get two nice Triggers on the aux
I think we roll that for now
and then an elephant combined with a
camel is the play you're looking for but
it is what it is
still is what it still is
um I think we want you to if you're not
going to have garlic we might as well
have you hit kind of hard and then maybe
this is like extra super draw technology
I'm and our peacock is not getting the
buff that we want anymore but again this
is like
it's it's for a purpose okay
this is a weird one
I don't know what to think about boom
City here three seven I like it
nice melon armor I I congratulate you on
your melon armor
we still slap you
and we're slapping you that means we're
slapping you which means we're slapping
you
we barely get through this but we did it
okay
now this Hedgehog is just chilling back
there he's biting this time he's waiting
he's waiting for his moment
giraffe is is a is a character man you
know what you do so Flamingo has been
good I would never want to deny that
um
but we can flamingo
I mean it's a A7 right I don't want to
say no to that but I'm also like I think
you can dump it
it hasn't actually had to attack yet
then
buy a Dodo okay this gives plus one plus
one to these two units the dodo feeds
its attack forward and we get permanent
melon armor on the ox that's that's
pretty sick now the problem from this
point forward
is that we need something
thank you in front of our whale that
gets a benefit upon being consumed
um
and we don't have that
so
I'm like do you have a whale that eats a
whale
do you just make your Ox that much
stronger with like uh
I mean you you gotta try to roll a squad
right but whatever we get it pretty much
has to go in front and nothing that we
have does well in front nor do any of
these
don't talk to me
this is not good but
I think sometimes you can find yourself
in a situation where
you know it this is the way to play it
even though it looks truly insane I
expect a loss by the way and it looks
like we're gonna play up to that
expectation
[Laughter]
but I don't what oh nil bog bog Goblin a
fellow a fellow film Enthusiast I don't
know what what else we we would have
done there honestly you can run an ant
at the front now if you want I mean
obviously things are quite dangerous
turkey's really good man
um
but I it doesn't fit what we're trying
to do
kangaroo does work nicely right here
then you're like you gotta sell a whale
then it's like that it's the only way
because the squad just doesn't work like
the way we're trying to equip it
this is not good this turn seven I'm
looking at this squad and I'm saying to
myself it's it's trash it's no good
look at this cutie baby oh my word
Kate I'm getting torn up in Super Auto
pets right now
I'm rich P bod and the panicking
bagpipes like
they're trying to send me to the shadow
Realm
and I think it's gonna work
hello
oh
I really okay a really good tweet what
is the tweet
do you know what true love is okay I
can't help but feel like I'm about to
get absolutely roasted
yeah is this a
true oh no
you're you're laughing
oh and even though you're in pain you
give a hug back and say I love you to
them oh that's sweet despite she she
just kicked your boob hey honey
hey
can we do can you look over here
peekaboo
a peek-a-boo good job
where's your
head there's your head where's your nose
no no that's we're still working on that
one a little bit
hey peekaboo
peekaboo
she's she's very happy right now
probably because she
'd be like I made mommy laugh
[Laughter]
very happy she was coughing for a long
time
she knows some of these animals maybe
fish you know fish
what an achiever it's the beaver
yay
your peace
how dare you
what do you juice me squeeze me
freezer I think there's a freezer right
there
excuse me that's a freeze right there
oh
honestly I think this would be an
amazing game uh for a baby
to introduce them to you know a little
bit of strategy a little bit of
mathematics
probably not at that level
you know Minecraft is it's a monolith
you know it's a that's a big game
oh look at this
it's it's non-violent you know the
enemies just kind of like you know bump
into each other
now this has had you want to see the
secret Cape we just unlocked level two
units right yeah or tier two
then you create
a level two unit it takes you one level
higher so even though it's only turn
three all of a sudden now we got a a
tier three unit that can freaking go
roll me once
excuse me
sell me
excuse me
I don't know I just make it up as I go
buy me
this is gonna be a buy me sell me thrill
me freeze me deck squeeze me I'm can I
I'm gonna I'm gonna make a bold
prediction
and that bold prediction is I don't need
a full Squad to win this one
buy me
sorry that's what freeze me this is a
tease me
and don't bereave me I don't want to be
bereaved
yeah watch this
here's your elephant
yeah nice nice peacock you got there uh
except for how I killed it easily
wow nice ants
finally my hand gets destroyed oh tough
luck for you all of a sudden I got a 9-6
kangaroo Med 55 is out here posting on
the forums how did he get a kangaroo on
turn three
it doesn't make any sense well
life's hard
look at that five eight ants it's it's
getting out of control then you're gonna
buy a beaver then you're gonna sell me
that's a that's a bit of a tease but a
bit of a squeeze
I think you're gonna buy me I think
you're gonna buy me
I'm gonna be honest with you I think
following these buys you do this by
right here in the interest of making our
aunt live longer so our kangaroo does
better
this is we don't lose these our stats
are way too good
I I feel like there's like a flow chart
in gaming
um well actually this is a pretty spicy
Squad but you're not gonna make a spider
and a b your squad's too full
there you congratulations you played
yourself
ah
this is pretty good like when when
you're winning
easily which and I don't mean to just
play up the bravado but when you're
winning easily you invest in your
economy when you're losing you invest in
the squad and we're winning easily so we
got some we got some economy investment
going on here that's three wins
trying to get over that five hump
I mean this is a pill me
no doubt about it
then you gotta think
I'm a big fan of some some buy me sell
me's okay
you're gonna lose a lot of the stats
that we would get if I like you're gonna
give a plus four plus two
then you're gonna get re-summoned as
like a piece of crap
I feel like the whale is not worth it
here I feel like that's that's a bit of
a trap
now we're talking
I kind of
um
we want you to stay alive
I think we're gonna you know what shrimp
me
buy me
ah
ah garlic me
freeze me
dog
I I sleep dog
I'm I'm starting to regret getting rid
of the flamingo but you know what look
at this we're buffed
we're buffed
it's the biggest shrimp you're ever
gonna see in your life
we still get you
please we still get you though
that's four wins four wins zero losses
now there this is where you get some Buy
sell him him me him me him me this ant I
do think it's time for it to go I think
we roll a combination build I think we
sell the ants
but not before we buy the second shrimp
then we sell you
then we buy you then
then we roll we're looking for yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Freeze Me freeze me
sell me
buy me
squeeze me
Romy
roll me Freeze Me freeze me
and my word
my word honey
this is a bit of a spicy build we
haven't lost one even though we're
rolling exclusively
some shrimps and some some swans
big whoop nice dolphin for me to poop on
now this is not great
um this is probably a loss
two Rams is a is a it's a very nasty
situation
the dog is going to outpace our uh our
Swan obviously because that's what it
does
this is going to be our first loss but
you know what it's not a sign of things
to come
it's just a necessary step in the in the
middle shrimp meat no shrimp okay then I
mean this is just
you go wild here you copy the level one
ability from the unit ahead
there's something to be said
[Laughter]
for a little
I think we don't want a turtle actually
as sad as that sounds because he's a
nice boy
you go heavy on the kangaroo
you sell the cow
you buy
Google we still roll this for now
but we got to think about our future
from this point out so we basically got
another level one kangaroo that's not
doing too much back there right now but
we really need to get that garlic going
too I see a level one dodo this is a
squad that scales that doesn't mean it's
a squad that wins immediately
we get a nice hit here we get some melon
armor kill the peacock in one go
the kangaroo will not kill us in one go
the dodo gets iced
the giraffe gets iced okay have we done
it have we broken the five win curse
nope five wins
we've been here before don't forget
so if We're Not Gonna Roll a parrot
because we're probably not then you sell
then you buy then you sell
and the Buffs are coming Fast and
Furious
and then we probably want to buy we
probably want to buy
at some point we're going to sell our
swan
I'm thinking about but I think this
turtle is honestly not long for this
world
though I though I'm loathed to admit it
but you know what I like I like where
your head's at
I think it's a combine me
buy me
sell me
Turtle me it's a bit weird
really relying on our kangaroo to do a
hundred percent of the damage
hey
Penguins they buff level two and level
three units uh every turn they can they
can get Mighty spicy if I do say so
myself this is a loss by the oh oh
this is a a 100 loss
oh my God
please just let me get to more than five
that's I I recognize I've played fast
and loose with the with the situation
here
I will be done very soon by the way
okay bye bye see you soon honey
um
this is a big play I think you
absolutely
kill the turtle to get the melon armor
and then we want you to continue to get
buffed I mean look at this thing it's an
11 22 thanks to the shrimp the shrimp
and Swan will not live forever but I'm
happy they're here right now
um I think maybe we freeze this
we're looking for some big plays right
obviously I I'm not totally sold on a
hippo
for the time being I would probably say
we're going to give it a chance
just because we need something
um
roll me
it's a buy
for the incredible buff sell
that's okay and then maybe you freeze a
kangaroo
and run like uh
you can start to think about running an
AUX huh it's turn nine
but it'll scale pretty nicely you're
going to get sold soon you're going to
get sold soon yeah I think we can roll
an ox here
now this is the last
uh I mean especially because we're only
two lives left this is the last one
where I'm like
we're gonna roll this meme build that we
got okay
it's the last one of those
not the last video where we do that
because that's kind of like I guess my
thing
um but it's the last uh
while we busted through the melon armor
a little bit that's fine
um wow
you're a piece that's that's a win for
you what a strange Squad but a b with a
fedora gets the job done now we have to
Pivot to strength is basically what I'm
trying to say so
um if we're gonna do that the swan
should go first because then we get an
HP buff then the time has come goodbye
are we gonna roll a hippo I don't know
what I do know is we're definitely
rolling that
so I think you can look at this as whale
man it's it's such a crappy whale to be
here late but
we get a nice double buff out of that
you probably sell the hippo
monkey you know it's scales so there's
there's a lot to like there
I'm like I was gonna do a buy me sell me
but there's no point
deer also obviously does nice here but
let's roll with the mammoth and and see
I guess we'll roll a monkey up at the
front I'm not optimistic I think we're
gonna get stuck at five wins again
I I genuinely do
we're starting to run into some serious
problems
um
I think that they're in the process of
making a turkey build work they're not
quite there yet
that doesn't mean they'll lose To Us by
the way they could very easily beat us
[Laughter]
we'll see
we are at 3143 with melon armor but then
like you know it it adds up pretty fast
that Ox is going to be a real problem
like you get a b and then we hit you
okay we hit you
we're gonna live through this and kill
you oh we're gonna die through this but
that's okay we've broken the curse six
wins six wins it's possible
it's possible
honestly like your whale should just
have a stake
if it's going to do anything at all and
I think melon armored beats garlic late
game IMO so I'm very content with this
do we want garlic on anybody I don't
think so I think we're maybe investing
in cans or rolls long term so
for now we gotta
it it really the the whole run lives and
dies on our kangaroo we've we've made a
mistake there and we're way late on our
pivot oh my God this this Blowfish into
Snake the Monkey is whatever they'll
Blowfish into snake is is disastrous
it didn't hit my melon armor which is
the only positive
it's gonna
[Laughter]
yeah
um there's no way we get through the
gorilla like that's fine we're not even
getting through the crocodile man we're
lucky to get through the snake well I'll
take it okay all things considered I'll
take it
six wins thanks for watching we got
there in the end if you enjoyed it click

but then we got sucked into the sap
mines again here we go we are playing on
the free-to-play deck
get the free to play deck pump in here
let's see this is not my ideal first
shop there are no fish there are no ants
okay but that doesn't mean we can't make
something function here you can do this
even though i don't love a horse you can
oh but dude i'm so stupid hold on
let's get a dang casino roll in here
sorry
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
i am a robot i am your father
and if we're gonna do this hold on will
nell get six wins or more
two minutes betting time you know we got
a tweet i'm sorry
i need to update drivers before we play
more the good life sorry
we're playing super auto pets though
get in here or be cursed with mosquito
shops all day
cool guy voice making a comeback people
thought it was dead man
the rumors of my demise
are greatly
exaggerated
it's because we haven't been talking to
mouth that much lately not like out of
like design
it's just uh just hasn't you know the
the stars have not aligned i've been
i've been missing a lot of mondays okay
so we freeze you that you're a last
chance buy
i should have kept the otter around but
this this is functional this is not so
bad you can play an ant at the back he's
ready to crack
you're laughing there's a man at the
back he's ready to crack his eyes are as
red as the sun and there's a girl in the
corner who is nobody's mourner and she
thinks she's the passionate one and
you're laughing
hello chibly hello this is drawable
we got a very similar squad don't shoot
my horse don't shoot my who you mother
literally like the worst thing that
could have possibly happened there okay
the foamy pencils congrats one in three
shot just won you the game big whoop you
peace
okay this this is now a squad that wins
rounds
i know this looks a little goofy
we're gonna freeze you we're gonna we're
gonna make you chunk it we're gonna roll
you we're gonna freeze you
um
we can roll a horse for a bit we don't
need that this is fine this is fine
this is a winnable round if we draw it's
okay i don't see a loss happening
i just don't see it man i just don't see
it
we trade with the beaver
the horses are relevant
it's not really part of the squad uh
what the heck uh we lose this we lose
these
we win these
i told we draw these i told you
[Laughter]
i got my horses in the front
okay
um this is fine now we need to make a
tier three unit
tier two unit in the tier three unit
this is fine now you can head to the
back
we can put a whale out here mighty quick
make me think it's mighty quick
we will roll a temporary horse
that's a big freeze
we don't need to freeze a pill that's a
big okay this is another winter draw
this is a win or draw
we'll probably sell the crickets start
wailing the ants and then we're off to
the freaking races
or saying look in that temporary it's
round three we barely even gotten
started yet man
i don't break character till the dvd
commentary this is a win i don't even
need i don't even need to tell you this
is a win
you get owns we can we can go a little
faster on this one like
this is not a spectator sport
hello chibley by the way dedicated hey
button hey what's up
bro
i sleep but you know what tier 2 units
they can do some work early man
i'm thinking
you piece
so a turtle is worth rolling we won't
roll it right away but it's worth
rolling i think we rolled this squad
right here roll me once
swan me we replace the fish with the
swan the horse we're not gonna invest in
long term
these are some big buffs this squad
doesn't scare me a dodo that hasn't
scaled yet
and a level two cricket a giraffe that
hasn't had time to scale like your sheep
is a little nasty a little freaky
but so what
it doesn't get buffed by anything i'm
not sweating it look at this dude look
at this cricket this is no problem
put me on put me on high speed
that being said we are gonna lose
but our squad looks good for the future
so we're two two losses down two hp down
but health is a resource
you get sold
you get bought
giraffe is not hyper relevant to our
concerns cricket gets sold
in favor
we're doing a slow
transition here
okay
from from spam build to good build
i would love a level two turtle straight
up i would love a level two turtle give
me garlic armor on the swan this is a
this is a draw to win
terry's coming out there whale at the
front that's it i've seen it work it's
when you want a whale but you don't have
anything that works well with a whale as
a result you want to keep the whale
but you're you're mostly just holding it
for uh
for future considerations
you peace
you peace
you peace
easy wins
okay
it's not a scampi build i don't look at
this as a shrimp scampi build
i look at this as a roll
then i start to tell you okay start to
tell you something
giraffe scaling is okay is is okay a
horse no longer has to exist
our ant is going to be next to go
probably um an ox does okay here
you can make it you can make it go
you don't give it meat
because um
the the problem with that is that it
gets overridden by the turtle's garlic
armor which will come out
i'm i'm kind of a believer in this just
for the time being we can swap out of it
later
i'm a believer in this
i'm a believer in rolling i'm a believer
in freezing and then getting a sick unit
next turn
melon will override the meat yeah i
guess that's literally exactly what i
said isn't it
like i'm not being rude i'm saying i'm
stupid and bought the thing i didn't put
it on the ox because i was like uh oh
it'll be a waste on the ox but then
instead i put it on another unit that
had the same concern this bus actually
just crapped on us and then and that's
just uh that's a sequence of returns
risk there wow that's a heck of a loss
there
okay this we gotta we gotta get out of
this asap you still do this for a
top-tier unit
i'm just going to be straight up with
you man i'm not sold on the concept of
this turtle anymore the hippo we need
some scaling to make it work
you're gonna you're gonna spat out as a
4-7 huh
sell me
buy me
you can't suck up a buff unfortunately
it would be nice to even just have like
a b on you to get an extra trigger on
the aux but it is what it is it is what
it is okay you know what you can do here
i don't really don't want to get rid of
that ant i think we go heavy rerolls
okay this is good i mean it's fine
sell me even though the 4-3 ant is some
good stuff you sell me by me for hippo
scaling
roll me
if you can get a dodo to start popping
there's a chance
is a chance
this is a big moment though i see a duck
with a b which is gonna get a double ox
trigger
level two horse hey fs viper thank you
for the gifted subscriptions thank you
we still we get a melon armor which
scales us
we do uh we simply trade with the dog
unfortunately but then we get melon
armor on the ox
which means we win okay
there's something there's two wins three
wins three wins
now we are hoping to scale our hippo
with a dodo we need a little bit more
uh of the juice and squeeze variety
a giraffe is a little bit too slow we
know that's not going to be long for
this world
that donkey donkey donkey donkey donkey
dunk we roll again
we roll once more
we try this is a simple try
the hippo's gonna get melon armor your
hippo's gonna pop but guess what
my hippo's gonna pop
and it's gonna keep popping
and it's gonna keep popping
it's not going to keep popping past that
but that's still really good
we get some melon armor you're dead easy
wins
we're starting the you can feel the
wheels are starting to get some traction
here
up to a 50
minimum 50 win rate
kangaroo can do some work behind the
hippo in theory you could sell a swan to
try to make it work you can also peel
the turtle
to just get permanent melon armor
and then
i do want the buff
from the dodo to apply but we can stall
a little bit
like we can can for example
and then do a double buy here
that's a huge freeze
it's not really a shark build in my
opinion
freeze that
we would like to get um garlic armor on
our kangaroo but man we want to see
white weenie built this is not a white
weenie build this is hell
[Laughter]
this is a loss that's uh this is a one
heck of a
team this is nasty man
you see in this 18 1918 spider
my my word all right well we'll pay out
the doubters i mean that's a that's a
strong team
would have been nice to have not lost
some of those early rounds but you know
there's nobody to blame but everybody
but myself uh choose outcome
doubters win i repeat doubters win start
prediction pop me out once you pop me
out i never stop
start me up once you start me up i never
stop six wins
try again early shops change everything
man
don't
like this is also not a strong early
shop but i buy a duck 100 of the time
i have no qualms nor complaints about
running a two duck pig build taking an
early loss to get better later
absolutely we are the smooth sausages if
you want to doubt because i'm going duck
billed then then go ahead vote doubt i
can't stop you
this is a loss you expect to lose though
against uh against the ducks you expect
to lose
all right i mean with ducks i should say
the creamy legs
and then we either sell round two or we
sell round three
i see another duck
i see a little silhouetta of a duck
now the ants does better for us
and then we buff
honestly i'm a cell
bi
in this situation then we buff the fish
now i i am content
going down two losses already
don't shoot the ant
i can live with this
i i run this build every night in my
dreams
this is a definite loss obviously
but
now this is where the party starts man
you just gotta use your brain
rather than combine
i genuinely think you go
sell
sell
sell
now you have a five five dog
a four or five cricket
i'm gonna i'm just gonna level with you
a five-five mosquito is also pretty
freaking sick
um
and then we just buy an apple to scale
our dog temporarily we got a seven seven
dog chilling at the back
i will freeze two flamingos to make this
work this is where the party starts we
we do not lose this round you can't you
don't lose this round
this is an easy win
i know you're like comedic timing i
promise you it's not happening
a stats are way too strong
that makes you a little bit of a peace
you peace
you're at peace
yeah we didn't even have to use our dog
no sweat
ants can go its stats are unimpressive
insubordinate and churlish
give me a give me a two piece
we need to scale our units a little
faster
freeze me unfreeze me we don't lose this
one either
hmm 1010 beaver a little stinky though
i still don't think we lose though
yeah our dog solos the last two units no
sweat
look at this still owns
still owns
why are all the names in chat white
um bt tv is broken
for some reason
this is easy money you want to see this
you um
pill me
by me
combine me
you wanna you wanna see something
strange
buy me
sell me
are you a bad enough dude to do this
i don't think so i think i'm a bad
enough dude to do this
freeze me
roll me
by me
freeze me
scamp me no we're not in scampi yet okay
we're not quite in scampi tier
okay we're lowering somebody's hp by two
you piece
you're swallowing a spider
this doesn't seem that bad
it's gonna be it's gonna be close
you're going to spit out a little spider
your spider's going to get a little
stronger
your spider's then going to generate
another unit
i mean this is still a whim
is everybody you said like it's it's
real this is actually really bad that
was an easy win we just had to use our
backline unit for the first time
um
so i'm a big believer
i understand like the the dog meta here
but i'm a big believer in pill me selmy
which gives us
for a net cost of zero
gives us stats on the dog
there's not really a whale me involved
here though
it's more like a
it's more like a freeze me roll me
the way i see it
okay
freeze me freeze me
roll me
try me
i'm content
to lose
this round to get a double snail i think
that's the kind of kickstart we could
use
i'm not too worried about uh about a
hedgehog here we go we got some hp
involved there like a garlic armor on
our dog will help us
you live through this which is amazing
that's the most beautiful buff we could
have asked for it did nothing for you
we own you easily
okay
two damage to all which is one damage to
all and then you're dead
i think we we need something that does
better for us
that thing is probably a hippo
even though the hippo is uh
a scam
will hold the skunk for the time being
roll a hippo
freeze one apple just in case okay
you only buff level twos and beyond i
don't see it happening this is what we
were looking for it was a pair
i think it has to be done
garlic on hippo could be big
this would be a big win we we should
start running into some scary teams here
though
that kangaroo is is quite spicy
skunk you never know that might be
relevant okay
we don't live
in peace
level three and you peace you're also a
piece
in my opinion
yeah we we lose this one i mean that's
just a that's a nasty team that team's
that team's going somewhere
four wins come on this is start making
some plays man
i'm investing
i got no qualms about investing in a
hippo
freeze me
can me this is this is the play that's
gonna bother you okay can me to make a
kangaroo
pop off a little faster buying the hippo
next time if we lose this round it
doesn't matter but i believe i believe
we can make the rounds all we need is
our hippo to if our hippo kills one unit
i'm happy as long as it lives
oh that's a that's a heavy you piece
moment right there
probably chalk this one up to the
doubters again
dude the level two dodo so early okay
doubters
take your money and run
we're running into i mean dude let me be
honest even if we had a kangaroo we were
getting one tapped by that team so
that's that's not a surprise we got
another four point run in there
community is getting better for one but
also like we need some of those scaling
units early that's that's the meta right
now also the meta right now
this early
i don't mind
the bumbling streamers also known as the
dry ears also known as the bumbling
streamers
frida plays pretty cracked these days
people are very strange these days
this looks like a loss
yeah
okay
feed me by one hp losing the otters is
is kind of nasty
but there's not a whole lot you can i
mean you're you're beholden to the
to the run you get there
that's an acceptable juice the fish is
also important
freeze me
roll me
this is fine
we'll freeze you so we can make a nice
unit next turn we'll put a b on our fish
the fish will likely stick around for a
certain amount of time
it's a scary team as well
but we trade
we
kill you we trade
which is very bad for you
then you died in my freaking beat there
we go there's a win
these are big combination strats
into an ox an ox does really well
behind a cricket also it gets buffed
right off the bed
you know if we play our cards right
no you no be on cricket that's not the
play i think you can freeze some meat
and roll me
i'm not an enormous fan of uh
of the peacock anymore i think you can
go meet
on cricket
hey you know what it killed that tanky
beaver at the start that's well worth
the three gold even if we end up selling
it soon
we get nice buffs thank you so much
and then we go down against two one one
horses these are easy wins
we need to do something about our back
line for sure like like some scaling
would be nice
here are you honestly at this point you
could sell a horse the otter's got to go
too don't get me wrong i think you can
freeze an elephant
and put it at the back as kind of like
some ballast
i'm just thinking
i'm just thinking
pill spider
is an option
as honestly like we basically could not
ask for more
we're gonna try to scale the ox
i think you're very sellable you're
playable
and for the time being i'm actually a
big believer in like
investing in some units that are likely
to stick around for a little bit here
meat on giraffe will be good too but i
think the meat i like having meat on a
tankier unit whenever possible because
they stick around
you know they they're more likely to
survive a hit and get
get those plays
this cricket is freaking cracked mind
you we have some problems coming with
this pig
that's that's true pilling units in
front of the ox is a really
good strategy
to get um
permanent buff plus melon armor
there's three wins
well we'll buy an aux
we'll roll
i do like a turtle um i feel like we
sell fish now and roll kangaroo behind
the ox where it's liable to get some
okay buffs
now the giraffe buffs the kangaroo
instead
i accept this
it's part of the cost of doing business
we're probably gonna kill an elephant in
front of you
dodo can be really strong too i just
don't know if it also fits with the
giraffe i think
i think for now
we toss you this beautiful buff
giraffe is good now um
you know what did i give it in the tier
list yesterday
oh that's true i didn't even think about
that you obviously you would have the
giraffe behind the dodo so the dodo
buffs the units in front instead i was
thinking like uh a dodo buffing a
giraffe what's the point
this is fine we're definitely gonna
we're gonna trade with the fish no we're
gonna kill the fish and the dodo
and the swan look at that
garlic is in one hour ten minutes
it's on the horizon datara bullets
okay so this is a
pill me
oh baby
roll me
have the giraffe buff the dodo
invest in
freeze me
buy garlic for the kangaroo
roll me freeze me
roll me
beautiful
absolutely this is
if you're a believer i would feel pretty
decent right now first not for 10 wins
but for six wins this is looking like an
okay squad that doesn't mean we're gonna
win every game
i'm just saying
we we've actually for the first time
we actually have a squad that appears
like it has a chance to go
a distance maybe not the distance but a
distance
owned
owned
and owned okay
penguin is is just not quite there it'll
just buff our ox if we sell the cricket
which is the problem
rhino instead of cricket though is kind
of pog city um i think we can add we can
run a rhino
even with like a b on it to approximate
the effect of this hey
wait viz thank you so much for the
gifted subscriptions one for each sell
me
can me
by me
followed by a by me
now now this is a squad
we need level two dodo is a big actually
level three dodo is a big part of this
as well
seven eight rhino gets absolutely
crapped on first
we only trade with the fish which is
pretty bad
but then i'm looking at this and i'm
like i think our kangaroo does some okay
work with the garlic armor
no we do much better than trade what was
i talking about
the ox is going to town man that's a win
i clearly do not know math
look at that
we don't really want to sell anything to
get a pill meta going here
i wish there was like a reserve right oh
we're at six wins already look at that i
wish you could go like you know put the
rhino on the roster buy uh an otter pill
it etc etc to to buff the crap out of
this guy
or let me think you know what
screw it man i think i'm willing to sack
a rhino
i i do
to get watch this he's losing his mind
these don't give you a benefit on cell
except to make another
hold on freeze me
he's lost it
donkey dunk
that donkey donkey dunk dunk
i mean to be honest i'm like
sell sell a duck
pillow duck sell this hella duck
well sell duck
roll
once freeze you just in case roll once
buy a deer okay that's so much better
and we'll just save the pill for when we
want to use it on the deer oh my god
that's just like the the greatest
accidental role you could get
even then it's a little spicy there's a
spicy dog up at the front
it's okay we got a bus that does some
damage to the fish behind we're buffing
our ox that's what we like to see as if
we trade with the ox and get to attack
twice our kangaroo is going to go off
man
and by go off i mean losing me okay that
one's a loss
i see it sorry it happens
now
this is a
pill me
thank you so much
and then i think is a sell me
but we got to figure out what's
happening at the front if we're going to
roll this
because like rooster is great don't get
me wrong but how we buffing it we need
we the dodo is like it's it's screwing
us right now
and what are we buffing with the monkey
because we don't really want to muff
buff the bus it's it's a i know it
worked for justin once it's like it's
not a long-term strategy
i think this is a role you can be mad if
you want
i understand the madness
i think we can afford a placeholder
monkey just for now i know this is not
how it looks like it should work with
the ox but
just chill okay
freeze me cupcake me i know it's weird
it's weird
it's weird
sometimes you build against the meta
okay but you you just temporarily for
scaling purposes
this seems like a big get for us
it's a big hit
that's a big hit
you know we're killing that peacock no
matter what we're killing that's a
beautiful get
this is why look i know they on super r
super auto pits they won't tell you that
you can sometimes play an ox at the
front
in this situation we made the right move
the scaling continues although slowly
now you
give two friends ahead so now you're
also buffing the kangaroo which i like
to see
as long as you start with the melon
armor i'm not really stressing i'm
honest like i'm let's build anti-meta
we're building anti-meta right now
cow obviously
you know like used to
sell the kangaroo by the cow buff the
dodo
we need the kangaroo to scale better it
needs to get to level two if it's not
gonna get to level two then it has no
reason to exist right now
ergo get out of my [ __ ] face
see you in hell
you peace
thanks for the malk
scale me
scale me
buff me
buff me
i fully expect just for the record
i fully expect this round to have a high
percentage to lose
but
it might not
that's only a level one flamingo
i'm not sweating that
we punched through nicely now you're
weak as hell
we kill you
you're so freaking lucky you've got
melon armor whatever we still kill you
nice melon armor
this is draw
that's fine this is fine man
beauty
cow goes to the front
gets pilled
hippo's interesting i've been thinking
about hippo
because we can scale it with the monkey
but like with two hp i feel like we're
getting a little late in the game
rat me oh come on now
i think we can try
then we'd have to set it up like that
and we we really want to buff the hp on
the hippo so i feel like we freeze you
sell the
probably freeze you sell the giraffe
in the well we could even do it right
now
sell the giraffe
buy the cow
get you popping
i think this is our best chance to to
scale to 10.
it's got to be a big move like we
couldn't if we just wrote out what we
had there i think we were going down
this is very nice our first melon armor
does lovely work for us
then you summon something that's uh i
mean obviously that's bad then you
summon something that does like
well more damage than i thought honestly
you're gonna kill me
but then we're gonna get you good with
this melon armor right here this looks
okay but then you're gonna summon a deer
and it's a level two deer which is then
gonna summon a bus i think this is a
loss you know what you gotta great
sustain
great sustain on this build
more power to you
it had to be done there a piece no doubt
about it
i i stand by the decision we made
now we're just we're kind of hoping for
the best
sell me
and to be honest a gorilla can be pretty
good i'm going to throw a freeze in
there just just in case
fly is it it's great it's not the right
time
buy me
freeze me
salad me
i'm not optimistic about this gorilla's
chances but
[Laughter]
let's see
please please weak enemy at the front
you know i don't see a horse
this looks like a great build for a
hippo to run into hey kratom khan thank
you for the gifted subs as well
one for each enemy that this hippo is
going to destroy
guaranteed
here it comes
please
please i just
i would love to one tap the kangaroo
oh you're a huge piece you're so
freaking lucky i think we still come out
of this smelling like a rose but it was
a little dangerous that kangaroo was
quite nasty
still got it that's eight wins
you gotta go level two hippo even over
the monkey
freeze me
apple me i know it seems like we should
put it on the dodo but
um i want the hp more than anything else
dude the freaking uh
the the fact that we have a level one
dodo is just is pissing me off honestly
i'm just gonna tell you it's pissing me
off
level two chicken a little dangerous but
it creates a bunch of weak enemies
i mean not weak in terms of their power
weak in terms of their hp
this is another win man we're going to
nine
that's kind of incredible
it's a nine win round right here
um
i feel like you like you definitely at
this point get rid of the scaling from
the monkey the dodo is also like
irrelevant the time is not right so you
freeze the one up hoping for like a a
mammoth or something or a tiger
now the tiger has a lot of interesting
ramifications
you definitely roll it behind the
man if only we could get a level two
dodo
it will help the hippo scale better
but
it does really i think it does really
well behind the dodo even
people are like if only like i know i
rolled past one uh if i had infinite
resources sure do you this is where uh
all right never mind um
okay hold on now
now we got plays
unfor on no keep me frozen
this is now
this is very interesting
i'm just checking i'm like i don't
really want a gorilla at the back
there's no other great place for him
this is this is how we roll
that looks good that this
look okay this kangaroo is gonna eat
good
but i see a little bit of a white weenie
deck here and i say to myself pog
this hippo's got some scaling
it killed the whale through melon armor
level two deer lets us scale
10 10 bus we lived we died
but the ox lived with some melon armor
so it kills the kangaroo
we draw
[Laughter]
i thought we had it
it's fine we're scaling we don't care
tiger does not level unfortunately um
what we do want to do is we probably
want to sell
the gorilla
for something else but nothing else
functions right now
no
double tiger unfortunately doesn't work
i mean in theory i guess you could sell
a
monkey and put a tiger behind the hippo
then you wouldn't get the dodo effect on
the hippo
unless you move the ox out of there
you know hold on let's think about this
for a second
what have you reconfigured it
no because you need this well you want
the double dodo effect more than
anything else
i'm i think this is bad
genuinely the dodo or not the dodo sorry
in this uh
game
you need
to have the ability to punch through
melon armor the only way we do that is
via
this right here so i wish we hadn't
bought the tiger but life goes on
roll me
you peace come on now
you know you could totally just roll a
scorpion at the front
absolutely nothing wrong with that to
get like a one for one trade hopefully
on their
on their uh
strongest unit
and then like a one up on the scorpion
no because that'll replace the
peanut
[Laughter]
it's an interesting idea though and then
that's that's all we got right there all
right let's give it a shot
maybe
i like i like the way it looks so far
you're a piece
purged my melon armor you piece
i lived but we're not gonna live through
this the steak holy crap
we have melon armor once which means
dude i think we
you peace
it's okay it was a it was a good run
that was a great team and a well played
chili pepper
that's still a nine win marty i'll i'll
take that that was especially people
didn't believe in that that was the one
that started with the duck build
people were like my points my points
okay slash market is



points my points
okay slash marker that's sap one being
done we're gonna start another
prediction and run it back i've been
running some some meme builds lately man
like uh
i've been uh
i've been running a lot of just like
tiered level two tier one units plus a
penguin and then just hitting n turn and
turn and turn and turn
and you know you end up you get to turn
11 and you have like
four
pardon me like four uh
35 35 units and no matter what they do
it doesn't matter
you're not gonna love this i'm kind of
like throwing around one here i'm gonna
leave my fish on the bench
this is so funny
hey multi-functional thank you as well
for the gifted subscriptions thank you
um we'll be the comedic chunks because
it rhymes thank you again uh
one for each
half of one win we're gonna get here
okay
guaranteed
don't shoot my duck
i can live with that
i
i think we draw
how how spooky is that we did not
deserve it
you know what i mean by rhyme
alliteration
same difference big freaking whoop
this is a
sell me
and then a big time
buy me
a big time buy me
a big time buy me
roll me
freeze me freeze i know it
sell me
by me
freeze me
this fish
is gonna
is gonna [ __ ]
[Laughter]
and remember the fish when it levels it
levels up everything well it gives plus
one plus one to everything on this on
the squad
squad goals we might lose this round i
don't care about round two we haven't
even we have nothing set in stone on
round two
i think we draw anyway so no no sweat
look at that a draw is a huge win for us
here
calm down there guillermo del toro plus
two i'm gonna rarely do i get the chance
to plus two chat i'm gonna give chat a
nice little plus two for that one
this might cause our squad to not be
full but
i sleep
scale my fish please
giraffe
honestly
send them
roll me i don't care for a flamingo man
overrated and churlish
that's what we're [ __ ] looking for
that's what we're [ __ ] looking for
level three fish incoming
and you get two levels up because you
create a level two
and then you turn it into a level three
you get two levels up are you listening
are you hearing the words that are
coming out of my mouth
okay you're a piece but i'm telling you
watch this watch this
here's how you play this don't be an
idiot okay
i know we're gonna miss a buff on this
it's acceptable to miss the buff to get
a higher tier unit
we do care for you
freeze him for a second
combine me
swallow the ant
we're going to add one more giraffe in
here for the time being
keep that pill frozen roll me
sleep me
question mark question mark question
mark oh lewis hamilton cut the curb a
little bit uh f-i-a-f-i-a lewis hamilton
cut the curb a little bit
won't somebody tell him lewis hamilton
cut the curve oh he just he just won
again he just won another race
they should really hire me as an f1
driver i would i could be lewis hamilton
i saw how he cut the curb on that one
you know nothing's punching through this
11 12 fish prepare yourself
he's an agent for doubters all right
doubt this
oops
oops
easiest win of my life
now
this is a combine me
it's a thinking man's game right now
nl's an agent of the doubters
so true
[Laughter]
so true
um
yeah this looks solid let's keep it here
rigged rigged rigged fia excuse me
fia lewis hamilton's car is faster than
mine
oops
oops
it is a nasty little hedgehog at the
back there i'll give you that
it's not going to matter but i'll give
you that
this is what happens when you got the
devs in your dms
i mean three dodos right off the bat is
that's that's a big hit man that's a big
hit
probably not going to need this anytime
soon so basically um we know we're
replacing the ant in a second
we sell the fish
because the bison will scale beautifully
it'll take a couple turns to get there
the fishes are level three
pill this son of a gun regardless
okay in that case we roll
changes everything
roll me we need two good units this is
this is functional maybe not
for good
it's functional for now this is runnable
here i know we just peeled one
i gotta be honest with you uh i feel
like believe it or not even though this
makes the whale look like pure [ __ ]
the sheep does better to enable the
kangaroo so this is a bit of a disaster
but just give it a second
i'm telling you i i remember when we saw
a whale at the front uh like four rounds
ago what did i say to you what words did
i say to you i said sometimes it works
some just do it a circumstance obviously
if you fantasy drafted
your team you would not build around
this
but for the purposes at our present
disposal it may prove
advantageous
go we needed that
so get owned
get owned
wake up honey we're throwing
so true
so true third win in a row
i don't see why we wouldn't
we do have to figure this situation out
okay so what a turkey definitely can
function here um
and we pivot bit by bit the whale goes
but then we no this is tough
this is a tough one okay
because we don't want to play the sheep
at the front
if possible but we don't have any other
unit that does better the sheep the
sheep at the front
is not great
eat the kangaroo
i think long term that happens
short term i don't know
but you know what sure okay i'm
yeah all right i'm willing
and then
we do roll that regardless
i've learned the error of my ways
the error of my place
probably we end up rolling a rooster
here at some point
probably just instead of a whale right
now
but we don't have the money to do it
acceptable
all we need is a uh we need a fly
uh we need well
i was gonna say move the dodo but no i
actually like the dodo here even though
it sucks that it uh buffs the sheep
i want the giraffe to buff the dodo so
that when we get into our late game
build the dodo buffs the things it needs
to buff
we would rather have the giraffe buff
the dodo than the dodo buff the giraffe
dodo third is wasted stats yeah but we
want the giraffe to buff the dodo
because then it gets permanent stats
that when we stop wasting them
they're gonna pop
and there's gonna be carnage you're a
piece honestly you're a piece
we're still making it
there we go okay we're gonna hold this
rooster for the time no we're not we're
gonna we're gonna we're gonna kick you
out we're gonna roll like that even
though this looks junk right now just i
promise it's not
this is this is now great
now a camel can work here but
it's not really the right time yet this
is more like a uh
we're looking for statistics we're
looking for stats
that's a
stat probably you apply it to the dodo
monkey is is too late it's too little
too late
well not my favorite rolls
this is still good though
you're going to look at it right now
you're going to be like it's not that
strong
just let it let it percolate on you for
a second see if you feel the same way
seems okay
we knew this was coming as long as you
punch through the blowfish right after
we ain't sweating it because we got a 16
one right there
very more than happy to trade for you
right here
not quite killing you in one
i'll settle for two
it takes us to win number five nl's an
agent of the doubters by the way
second turkey is a no-brainer
can not that relevant yet
obviously like if we combine the turkeys
when we get like a fly we'll feel a
little differently about oh i'll tell
you i'll be honest with you now like if
we got nothing else to spend the money
on we'll roll it
it's the same squad
they are a little spooky
uh and in fact that deer if there was a
whale there we would have been in a
rough spot as is don't shoot my sheep
you mother
that costs us slightly
more than i'd like but
nonetheless because we icy we are this
easy ice easy ice things went as well
for you as they could have possibly gone
and yet still
we got you
we still gotcha
there you go believers win
sorry sorry to all the believers that i
was an agent of doubters on this one i
apologize
that's my bad i shouldn't have
allied myself with the doubters like
that
this is fine the squad is fine um
i'm not i'm not a giraffe for cow
individual i'm enjoying the buff into
the buff here i think that's that's
doing great
i think we can totally do this
i think we can totally roll once
i think we can totally roll twice
you're tempting me
now
the chicken does not need to spit out
two chicks yet
it's better for the turkey to buff we
need to work around our positioning here
in order to make the rooster pop better
freeze me though i mean come on you're
still gonna freeze me like
that's a gimme
well think about how we're gonna do this
from the from this point onwards
this is a spicy start here
but i think as long as we trade oh no no
no because of that yeah the freaking
rhino
ah you peace your bees level two rhino
let my turkey pop let my turkey pop
first man
how dare you
how honestly how dare you man
that the rhino hard counters us it's
fine it happens
weenie counter build it's just a nice
just a nice rhino quite frankly
can't be too upset
i think we are looking
to
sell our giraffe
in order to be able to move the rooster
to a better place
but we're mostly hoping to replace it
with
a tiger or a fly for now we can work we
don't need to sell and then just throw
like an ox in
we're looking for tigers
we're looking for flies
um
just to be straight up with you a
penguin up at the front just to get some
stats temporarily seems totally fine to
me
sell me
buy me
run me up at the front because we don't
care for you
then level me
roll me
dude honestly a one up on this sheep is
gonna slap
it's this is what you need
so
we will
presumably
be dumping
the penguin and then thinking about our
order
in order to roll a tiger behind our
turkey
yes
absolutely
i i have place
it's to start kind of unimpressive what
are the what are the question marks for
you don't need two tigers
same people who want two tigers they're
like the same kind of people who are
like if j owing once a day is great then
j owing twice a day is gonna be amazing
it's not it carries deleterious effects
due to its scaling okay
sometimes there's a magic number for
things and if one is good two can be
worse
you can get diminishing returns
now this is good
the penguin is gone
he's going bye-bye
well let me think
we need the roll tiger behind the
problem here okay it's a flow chart
the tiger needs to go behind the turkey
full stop however that pushes the
rooster to the front which makes the
rooster worse okay so maybe you put the
rooster back then it puts the sheep at
the front which makes the sheep worse
okay that's also bad maybe put a dodo at
the front then the dodo has no reason to
exist so what that means to me is that
you probably end up cutting the dodo
even though it carries a steep cost to
cut the dodo i think it's worth it for
positioning so i think you sell the dodo
first
as as strange as it sounds
even the server was like are you sure
the tiger goes here the penguin stays
for now because they're giving stats
then
the sheep gets a one up
well hold on
two chicks two four four rams
the rooster gets a one up
because we get the double turkey spam
build i respect it
yeah
yeah the double turkey spam build will
still work for us here we're gonna look
for another one up for that sheep next
not necessary but if we're not doing
anything else then sure why not i mean
if we get you to level two at least the
penguin will scale you
this is good
it's a nasty team by the way that we're
running up against here
nice try
not the not the tiger thank you as long
as the blowfish dies early we ain't
sweating it
rooster needs third row oh you peace
i don't think oh yeah it does because
the tiger died and we have it only
spawned because the tiger died we have a
one up i understand you're right you're
right you're right
okay don't shoot my don't shoot my chick
owens
the turkey's gotta live man
the turkey's gotta live
that's all i ask from you
we lose instead of a draw we lose by one
hp are you kidding me
so close
now i mean you
no matter what how you do this you're
not gonna like the order
it kind of had to be done
um
honestly you're going to laugh but the
we don't really in my opinion we don't
need a one-up on the tiger we just ran
into like the ultimate sniping builds if
we don't run into snakes we already have
great anti like crocodile and dolphin
technology that's not a that's not a
huge problem
i think you can freeze the stake we're
looking for a stronger unit to go here
if possible
the hippo is way too late it's not even
in the contest it's not even it's not
even up for negotiation
look
why would i get a plus 20 attack when i
can just get plus two plus two on this
guy thanks to a unit we don't even want
to keep anyway
we will freeze that though
okay we're scaling a loss is a win
because we're scaling
uh the crocodile i do not fear
see
we already had the equivalent of melon
armor there
now this ant is a little spicy
this seems okay
this this seems okay
all i'm asking okay because people are
like you you're you're wasting one of
the roosters
we have to either waste a rooster
or a chick
or or a sheep i should say
because otherwise we need to move them
both so they're before position two
or after position two so what do we do
we put a turkey up at the front i don't
think so
seems unlikely
or run four animals
selling the unit at the front does not
move the rooster back
doesn't make any sense
i just i'm merely asking for for thought
now i do think this anti-snipe
technology
matters
so here's the thing
you're like oh get a mammoth because the
mammoth is gonna give plus two plus two
to everything when it dies yeah but we
also have a penguin that gives plus two
plus two to everything
at the end of its turn and then also
gets to attack after
oh plus one you're right it is plus one
plus one
i still i prefer the penguin on this one
for now i don't think that
five nine
i i prefer the straight up i prefer the
penguin i think i think a penguin
steak
the d i think it splits the difference i
don't think you need gar you know here's
the thing i don't think garlic on the
tiger is good but it's better than
spending three gold on nothing
yeah penguin is is permanent
the uh
the mammoth is only for that battle
this one looks a little dangerous don't
get me wrong
there's two fights left yeah but like
the mammoth is is not better it's just
like
i think it's actually probably
mathematically worse
than a penguin with steak on it for sure
plus like we won so [ __ ] you
eat it you know like easy win
okay
just show your show your hands off keep
your brain pogging okay it's
entertainment
this is why they don't have they have
the media in to ask the coach questions
after games
they don't have fans come in and be like
why did elias miss the net on that shot
in the third period
because it's [ __ ] hard okay and in
every every everything you see here is a
choice these are all choices it's a
complicated matrix of problems we're
going to have disagreements and again
the position that you get to be in as a
viewer is if he does something i
wouldn't have done and it didn't work he
should have done what i would have done
because then it would it could have
worked so it's like mathematically
better so you know what take read
between the lines take one of those
okay hold on
now we don't need
i i don't buy one up tiger because
here's the thing if we get if if it gets
sniped it needs to get sniped by a lot
i don't fear this
i don't fear this i don't respect it
okay
we're walking through spaces okay
i think you can sell the penguin
i do think you can i think you could
roll the penguin as well and just buy
two sushis
the problem with our fly
is that if we the fly needs to be close
to the back in order to get the benefit
okay we probably want it at the very
back because we don't want the tiger to
buff the fly is there's not enough room
for what we want to do so instead we
would roll fly
tiger turkey we can't move the turkey
further up which means we're going to be
losing probably like almost half of our
units just by playing rooster and sheep
up at the front
so
i actually think you don't buy fly
i think you buy one sushi
freeze one sushi roll once
and buy the other sushi
i just don't there's just not enough
space for the fly it it's again it's
reaching like
you know you're over filling the soda
cup with dr pepper and then you got
sticky hands we may lose
i don't think it's it would be a loss as
a result of the fly
this is this is an interesting uh
is a spice build here we got a
we got spam
versus depth like this shark is a little
spooky
they don't have a turkey though
our sheep are gonna have to do a lot of
work
like a lot of work
the shark can only get to 50 50.
mind you that's probably good enough
as long as we're not dying there that's
okay
we smack we get three pretty nice units
it takes oh oh oh
hold on
can't help but feel like it appears
we're probably going to come out with a
win on this one
and
he's basically testing
the fly strategy against us so there's
10 wins
sorry for sorry for being an agent of
the doubters
turns out fly good unit sheep a little
bit better
it's just better
probably uh pay out the believers on
that one happy to see 58 of the audience
on the right side of history
then we can roll one more back we don't
have time for all the academia this time
we pretty much we gotta roll quickly
because we got guarded coming after that
donkey donkey donkey dunk okay i gotta
get myself back in a tier one mindset
oh you know
well let's stick with free to play while
we're here okay
fish is good i mean this this is a just
buyable shop quite frankly
fish at the front though with no ants
roll me once ooh
freeze the okay you're not you're gonna
hate me in round two just think of that
before you before you bet
you're gonna absolutely hate me in round
two and then i'm gonna win and you're
gonna be like it was luck get ready
ant at the back it's an interesting
strat not necessarily bad just
interesting this is a draw
smooth heads is a great name it's so
good
[Laughter]
okay here's why you're gonna be mad
buy me
you're not going to be around me in
round two you're going to be mad at me
in round three
roll me get an ant
you peace
might as well honestly
and i want both fish frozen i think
i'm not messing with you i think it is
possible we will have two units on round
three
the the
flip side
is that
they're gonna be two nice units
this is fine wrong whole slayer 69 what
what a name man
what a name
okay
i know the fish buffs the whole board
it's got to be done
i never had a choice
that's that's worth going in for man
sell me
everyone's like don't do it don't do it
reconsider
read some litter to run the subject you
sure
frick it
okay
we like this
we like this
we like this
no we do okay come on don't be don't be
stupid
just buy just freeze yourself a little
crab
roll it
you can do this
what is he doing
i don't know what's going on and i'm
scared
[Laughter]
oh
okay
this this kangaroo is the is the straw
that stirs the drink i don't know what
that means but people say it from time
to time
that's pretty nasty that's a little
nasty
do they macros people say it many people
are saying this
i don't want to say i i told you so
[Laughter]
he won i'm telling you you gotta you
gotta work on your strategies gamers
so-called gamers
roll me once
sell the crap out of me
i love a sell me man
that's a freaking buy me
what what are you doing
it's a freeze me roll me
you peace that's a by me
oh
yeah that's the thing man i you know
what super auto pence is kind of like
it's in a position right now where it
reminds me a little bit of the the game
known as chess
people are like you know they watch me
play and they're like hey
uh
on turn six you deviated from the nydorf
uh dragon in the sicilian defense and
i'm like yeah and then i won the game
with an absolutely
soul-crushing sacrifice what's your elo
by the way and they're like 600 i spend
12 hours a day
watching uh gotham chess videos on
youtube
sometimes you got to use your
problem-solving skills in the moment
in order to make solutions okay
it's not always about memorization
that's a sell me
honestly like if you're going meme
me me
me me
i do like a turtle but roll me
no it can't be done
huge freeze
unless
unless
i'm not sweating
i'm not sweating this man
nice melon armor it'd be a shame if it
got popped by a freaking bee that didn't
do anything be a shame if you got owned
be a shame if you got owned
be a shame if you got owned
okay wow what a horse oh whoa a horse
okay what do we have two wins two wins
all right this is a weird one this is
not a common build okay giraffe has no
reason to exist anymore
that's a buy me that's a sell me
that's a buy me
camel camel
but hold on if you're gonna do a camel
you should definitely buy me sell me a
little buy a little cell
and then you should definitely duck me
twins basil buy me sell me
camel me
for now i still like this believe it or
not but
you ducked my camel
[Laughter]
hey did you just touch my hiney
that's fine
i'm not even upset
all right this one it looks moderately
spiced
however
our kangaroo is a slapper
we don't we do die on this [ __ ] but then
we go up against a bunch of garbage i
think this is this is uh this is a this
is a win look at that easy win
shrimp wins again
uh
by me
we're reworking the whole freaking run
okay
this is a huge sell me opportunity
this is a
sell me
rhinome
dodomi
absolutely
garlic me
and then a roll me
probably a can is a freeze here
and then a freeze
and then a freeze
we do have a 413 kangaroo due to our
cell builds
no no tankiness we want to see no
tankiness up at the front
huge plays the rhino's going off you
ready for this whatever we don't catch
the shrimp it's too late you really
think i would have told you my shrimp
oh never mind if it hadn't already been
put into action
many minutes ago this is probably a loss
let's just be real that that i wasn't
paying attention to the numbers mason
eat it
i don't know man our kangaroos kind of
gonna pop
i know that we got a ton of whales
popping out of the woodworks in a second
here but
i think this is this is a draw man
uh never mind i was wrong uh wait no
okay it's a draw
never mind it's a loss
by one
you piece read between the lines on that
one
good dog
congrats congrats you have a good dog or
whatever fish has got to go it's too
late you fell off
sell me
buy me
monkey me
honestly you need the tankiness more
than anything else you need the
tankiness here even though it's only one
you need the tankiness
i'll check on the remind me to check on
the golden poop hat after this the this
blowfish shark holy crap like you at
least if you're going to roll a a
an early blowfish like this at least
have the good sense
to uh
you piece
not be on a guest account like come on
like at least log in so you can
you know enshral that run in the annals
of history
sell your shrimp
how about you sell your shrimp
freeze me cupcake me this is a very
important moment for the cupcake
1415 rhino is about to frickin blow you
away man
explode into space double peacock build
owns
owns
owns now i will admit we are about to
get on but that was still a pretty nice
start there
um
it still looks like a loss man
the peacock is just too strong
yeah
who would have thought your your cow
could have done it
losing to a cow hurts the most well
anyway we'll pay out the doubters on
that one
solid shrimp buy a shrimp get another
shrimp
that was a fast one slash



hey everybody welcome back
it's nine well it's it let's give me
some credit i'm at work early it's 8 52
a.m
on a tuesday
after thanksgiving
atmospheric pressure i don't know feels
normal cold as heck though it's seven
degrees celsius today
that's not that cold in like a broad
sense
like you know you could get that that's
like
warmer than your refrigerator for
example
um
but when you consider that it's like the
second week of october and we had a 40
degree celsius heat wave like two months
ago is a little surprising we got the
heavier shirts on today
um
playing some super auto pits i gotta let
you know i i played a little on my phone
last night i got a 10 win marty i went
10-3
with a stacked hippo
a level two rooster
with a tiger behind
a dog that was just like chilling he was
just a vestige of an earlier time
i can't remember what we had in position
two
he was doing something though he was
doing some kind of work but it just goes
to show you you know
a hippo is is good enough
i'm stupid i'll be the fatherly um i'll
be the uncertain astronauts it's just a
good name now if you go real quick
you might be able to get that because i
wasted a gold okay
the expected value of one re-roll when
you have one gold left is not that high
but it's like the thought that counts
this is a loss no it's a win no it's a
tie
it's a win let's go
i don't know how to do math
um
that's fine it's fine man i don't i
think it's a good idea to buy a beaver
that way we we sell it back next time we
get some yield this is like a gimme um i
i think it it comes down to whether you
want to lose this round or uh
at the
reward of putting yourself in a great
position for the future i think that's
what i'm gonna do um so
my general principle here when we're
full up okay the duck is to
here's how it goes okay next turn
we combine our fish we're gonna get em
the fish is going to become a level two
it's gonna go across the board give
everybody a nice buff we're gonna sell
our duck our tier three unit
that we unlock is then gonna be plus one
plus one which is very good that's
that's a bit of a force multiplier if
you will um we're gonna give you
an apple because we have nothing
else to do right now really
uh and and we're gonna recognize that
this is a higher chance of losing this
round for a better chance to be well
positioned from this point onwards
we kind of get a two for one
like we got one point nine and then we
kill you
and then you two for one me
i think this is a
i think this is a win would you believe
it it's just the the value of a fish man
it's it's kind of like a nothing unit
but
it does some serious work for you in the
in the in the right circumstances so
we're we're begging
freeze me
for a fish
i'm going as deep as it needs to go we
don't care for these units
at some point if we don't get a fish we
got to start thinking
what the world holds for us and i think
something you can do
you can combine fish
buy a shrimp
sell
a duck
buy a peacock
probably place it
i think we want to set it up like this
now
and then roll one more time so i'm not
exactly like thrilled with the way this
went
but we are up 2-0
we didn't get to our level three which
is a bummer but a 2-6 peacock early i
mean it beats a 1-5 peacock nice nice
two-for-one hit the ant hit the ant you
piece let's go
wasted buff
i'm not i'm not worried about the
peacock getting buffed we knew that it
was gonna be strong enough like
regardless now
you i think this is a draw which is
actually
is actually pretty great when you
consider
um that our roles were a disaster
and i believe i'm using the term
appropriately one thing you can do and
it depends how funky you want to get
right so a shrimp when you sell a unit
it gives plus one
hp
to
somebody it depends
how deep you want to go okay i think we
can afford to do this
that's not what we're looking for but it
allows us to roll the shrimp a little
bit more
prodigiously i suppose i think we want
to roll this squad
right here
don't combine them for the love of god
um this is a very weird setup for sure
um but we're we're we kind of skipped
our tier three uh force multiplier this
is bad a seven nine elephant is is
pretty nasty
um
and the ant's not dying early don't buff
the fish behind that's all i ask from
you
okay um this is you know what you hate
to lose to a guest because it's like
they don't even get to maintain their
points but that's you know that's a
nasty squad you respect it
we're gonna buff you like so
this double shrimp build is is spicy i'm
not gonna ever suggest that this is like
a normal way to live your life giraffe
for a nice buff possibly
i'm i'm just genuinely
uh i'm not sold on a blowfish anymore by
the way in fact can i tell you something
well i'm probably gonna buy one right
now but that's only because i'm gonna
sell the fish whoa
to kind of over commit
uh to what we've got going on with our
shrimp build
and i'm telling you like we are okay
this is actually very interesting um we
obviously want that for the future we
obviously want this for the now dodo can
actually be like an insanely top tier
get i love when you have the game on
fast forward in battle it just stays
fast forwarded
um
for the time being at least i'm just
like uh we need to get to a level two
unit this is like the longest i've ever
gone
without getting a unit uh at a higher
level it's it's crazy
this this looks great to me this looks
horrible to me i i did the math
completely incorrectly and didn't
realize we would suffer here uh it's
another loss and it's all fallen apart
and it's falling apart due to
let's call it optimistic shop play
i think this is like we gotta get over
that
um
we want this
i genuinely think we want the dodo to
start getting leveled as well i think
we'll put one of these on
on you first
roll me once i know we didn't stick with
the dodo okay
i know it you know it we all know it
well i hate to say it i think you keep
the dodo frozen and roll a flamingo up
at the front this is a bit strange this
is not
i mean we're two and two now and i i'm
not optimistic but if we could just get
a level two
camel or at least a camel that has some
extra hp like
the the peacock could run freaking wild
man
we're at least getting one peacock buff
this is a bit of a nasty squad
but the the real problem with our squad
is fairly obvious right like if
our peacock dies we have nothing else
that does anything for us at all
the flip side of that is that if it
doesn't die
we are totally fine
and i think you're seeing uh the the
proof of that right here
one peacock did enough to to get us
through there that's only level one
peacock too so
we're at 3-2
and uh
and hopeful for the future i it's like
i'm not trying to be like a butthole
about things but what if you
just hypothetically you know like got me
uh a unit that i already
had seen before in my life
just just
for argument's sake
so there is something to be said for
eating a flamingo but i don't know what
you give up now like the camel is not
great but if we scale it it's got
something admittedly the shrimp's not
doing much i'm kind of looking to sell
the flamingo though
we got one more role in us first i think
are you kidding me like i just
there's only a certain amount of units
in the game
why is it
seemingly impossible
to get the one that i'm looking for well
i think we should focus on
buffing the camel so that it can at
least get some triggers
hopefully um and we're still we're
keeping the dodo in reserve which is not
doing much for us admittedly
well then you're in roll situation
okay that's a huge freeze i i think we
you're gonna laugh at that one but
just work with me okay okay now we're
talking
flamingo
probably gets pilled
beaver gets sold for a nice buff
see they got a very similar build like
their their team is the team that they
told you not to worry about
we actually like the kangaroos gonna be
nasty but the camel is actually getting
multiple triggers for us here which is
insanely good
which means we're gonna one tap this can
we're gonna to tap this kangaroo
no garlic armor on the blowfish i think
that means that we're in
a drawn position and just barely
but now this is where it should start to
have a chance to pop i mean we we we've
been blessed with like good animals
showing up the only problem following
that is like how bad they've been
to when it comes to trying to get to the
next level
so this is like a buy
sell
for a decent extra squeeze there
parrot copies the ability
of the animal in front i actually think
it's kind of horrible for now
um but i do think you can roll
a monkey and then roll one more time
freeze me
uh well i don't know because are we
selling a giraffe at some point maybe
maybe not we're probably selling our
shrimp next just to keep the run kind of
like rolling
um this is still i would call this run
speculative and optimistic
like amazon's projections for how much
james bond's finale no time to die will
make it the american box office
now
that's
a turkey this early is not good for us
but
and i say this
this is a big butt okay
but it really is
once we get through these first couple
of waves here
and then also the sheep
i'm like if we can kill the horse we can
maybe do something seven seven four
i think
you're doing 10 damage each oh because
you got a level three horse
okay now this is where i just get mad
and i'm like okay congrats you got the
meta build hope you're proud of yourself
turkey showed up early
must
wow all skill i mean it's an auto
battler i guess i can't really be upset
but okay we're on our final win
opportunity here
you got you got to start sending and
like you're shrimp scaling i i'm i'm way
too invested in the concept of this
shrimp man like
it's not actually
that good
unless
so a hippo is how i uh
is how i got to a 10 spot last night
but i feel like it it needs to be said
you know that was uh
we had more room to play with than what
we have right now let's put it that way
we're not rolling turkey build hey
there's the fish that i was looking for
in the early game
i'm not thrilled about our current
prospects keep in mind we could sell
this giraffe at some point i like
i i'm
i'm i think we could get to six i think
this is a potential six piece those
crabs are gonna be
that they're setting up for the future
which is great news for me because it
means we're going to get an easy win
right here i also don't know if they
might be on three losses so
at some point we need to have more than
two units that do something like i think
we've done pretty well to get to 500 um
when you consider the fact that we have
two units that don't do anything
or sorry three units that don't really
do anything um
like they're both valuable your tier two
your two tier three it's probably less
likely to find a peacock at this point
um
and a turtle is kind of interesting you
could at some point melon armor will be
better than garlic armor because you'll
be going against enemies that hit hard
enough to kill you regardless
um but i think that uh
for now garlic armor is still superior
we might want to like sell a cow and get
a well select probably sell a giraffe
and get another unit out there but but
not right away we can wait a bit it's an
interesting build here the the flies uh
scare me a bit
but as long as we can hit this level
three sheep i'm not sweating it too much
they don't have like a horse or a turkey
or anything so you are summoning a lot
of flies
uh we don't quite have like a hip like a
hippo would just destroy this build
instead we're uh
we're again pretty much exclusively
relying on our peacock but it's actually
gonna get the job done
and the time has come to start building
out our back line
i don't mind the the monkey and the
giraffe sticking around but the cow
cannot be there
also like one
are we on pay to win i don't think so
right we're on free to play if a bat
hits us we just lose right so you know
playing accordingly
this is possible
we know we're gonna sell a cow
my thinking would be you could also sell
a giraffe because it only gives plus one
plus one
then
you would buy a dragon
excuse me this is like it's all screwed
up
you would follow up your dragon with a
mosquito
which buffs
basically there's your giraffe play
right there you would sell your mosquito
you would buy a cow
you would level up your camel so you get
more hits but also then more triggers on
the peacock you'd roll again freeze
yourself a duck for the future
i'm not saying we got a win here we do
our scaling has gotten better though
we just can't afford to lose uh well a
hippo
am i insane to think this doesn't look
that bad
like you killing your own hippo does not
seem wise to me because then it comes
out with no stats i think that's that's
the worst thing you could do there
lucky us
well from inauspicious beginnings we do
now find ourselves at uh
six wins respectable
to an extent
we're gonna sell you
i mean you know how we roll on this
we're gonna buy
probably buy the duck last we're gonna
buy you
decent we're going to buy you
we're going to sell you
we're going to buy you
we're going to roll you
now
which might be interesting isn't it
probably freeze you no matter what
if we can get a hippo strong enough
do i think it could still pop here
no
and the answer to that question is
almost always yes so i understand how
that probably comes across
um
but i i genuinely i don't i don't i
think it's way too late
it's it would only get
like
plus three plus three every turn maybe
maybe you give it a melon armor it has a
chance
we we gotta level it up
though i hate to say it i mean i guess
it would be plus one plus one to begin
with but though i hate to say it
i do kind of think
well can i tell you what i think i think
you buy sushi here
i think we stick with that duck i know
how stupid that seems we can sell it
next turn to get into a better situation
i didn't want to buy a mammoth and put
it up at the front because i worry about
going up against enemies who get a
trigger on kill like if they have a big
hippo or something like that
well at least we're living through our
first hit here this is a very similar
team
um
r peacock
almost
almost beats them there i think this is
a loss
but i don't think a mammoth would have
changed that maybe i'm maybe i'm
mistaken but
okay we'll run one back here i mean that
that took a while but i'm impressed we
had to puzzle something out there that
we went 6-4
this is this is very good
um i would describe this as a very
strong first shop i would prefer if my
fish got the stats from the otters so
we'll buy that first let's go then we
put the fish up at the front we roll
once double duck
means even if we lose round one you
gotta be the wet mouths man
even if you lose round one a double duck
puts you in an amazing position for
round three and beyond
this is a win i don't even need to i i
can i promise you it's a win
good start i mean it's just the value i
mean you have a 4-4 on round one you
just win the game
um
quack by the way uh quack we want to do
a double cell here
imo
you can invest
you freeze me roll
me freeze me
uh we should have bought an apple
instead but uh it's fine we'll buy
a bee and put it on our unit that's most
likely to survive for a little bit
then i'm thinking i'm like i think we do
it we might i really hope we win this
one so we can throw in round three
that's what i'm that's what i'm getting
at right now because i think we're gonna
want to sell both ducks to make our tier
three unit as strong as possible
and that might make it good enough for a
squad of four to allow us to live but it
also might not
either way we did win this round
we got a little lucky we went up against
another duck build i think but
certainly i can i can live with this and
don't don't get too attached to this
horse man we don't have to i mean it's
nice that we get the option we don't
have to live with it forever right so
give me this give me this
we get a tier 3 camel
i completely stand by what i said a
second ago
this camel getting upgraded to a a four
seven is disgusting uh and then i was
actually wrong because we got the money
from the cell obviously which then
allows us to roll a squad as long as we
don't reroll and and this is
complete no that was good this is
completely fine
this is a very dangerous team to run up
against early
i'm feeling pretty confident for the
time being
we're also pretty close to our next
level up this doesn't look bad for me
this fish is gonna get gross man
this fish is gonna be a menace
pretty much a wasted buff so well maybe
not because they it did allow them to
trade on that one
maybe it's not so bad
man that is there's a nasty team right
there
so we're at 3-0
with a lot of space we basically have
two spaces on the roster we can we can
augment here
um because we do not care
for the otter and we do want to combine
horses so there's something to be said
about running an elephant
uh in front of a camel but i think right
now that's
unnecessary not necessarily bad but
unnecessary
swan is just a it's a pretty strong unit
i would feel comfortable at least having
one in the squad for now
freeze me i think we have an obligation
to go
here
it's exactly what we want
we have to think about what we want to
buff though
and what we want to buff is
uh probably
our camel
which is weird because it means that
we're not getting the buff on our fish
but please keep in mind the camel is
more likely to be a member of this squad
in three rounds than the fishes so we
might as well start investing those
buffs where they belong
four eight peacock
six eight peacock
still dies to our giraffe
i think i think we come out of this one
just fine even though it it looks a
little bad
it's not that bad
look at this i mean i don't even know if
we've had to use our back liner this
whole time
like this this whole run so far and
we're at four wins zero losses which is
pretty amazing you know we want our
camel to go up
you know we want our camel to get one of
these it might be time to sell fish
or horse for that man in fact
probably say horse
then we would
still take our second swan
turtle is just weird because we don't
want it to
override
garlic armor
i think we'll roll a blowfish
um
this is not ideal
probably the best place for it is not
here the best place for it is to get
buffed but i'm really looking for like a
kangaroo to go behind this camel i want
to invest fairly heavily in this camel
um
you know especially every every round
that goes by
the giraffe
plus garlic armor allows us to survive a
hits against white weenie builds and i
look it's uh
it's a funny sentence we all laugh here
we all have a bit of fun
i'm i'm so
i was gonna say i'm so thankful we're
crunching through the hippo there but
actually you know what as long as we
beat the hippo we're fine and that's the
hippo getting beaten
have a slice of that
does suck rb is kind of useless now but
the fish is not long for this world to
begin with
get owned and we're 5-0 man and without
even like the dream squad we've always
wanted
ox can be pretty good
our blowfish is probably not a long-term
uh solution for us
um
so an ox behind a fish is okay but i
also do kind of feel like we want to get
rid of the fish
freeze me for a second we don't have to
make a choice quite yet
definitely i want another giraffe
and then a dodo
um with like a i think we should i i
genuinely think it's the right idea
i think you go for it
because you'd buff two friends and now
things get a little nutty for us
um
i think
because this way our dodo is now getting
buffed every turn which is amazing right
there's something about a crab here also
getting buffed
by getting buffed on the hp but the dodo
needs the buff the fish does not need to
exist
if that's the case
then it's probably
wise to actually buy a dolphin right
away and really the dolphin is just
going to exist
uh to hopefully snipe an annoying unit
at the enemy's back line and then get
sold next turn
it is a 4-6 if things go wrong
i mean we we killed a stake there
i can live with that man
somehow that actually worked out quite
nicely for us
this looks
this looks like a loss
that fish is very strong
honestly more power to you
you build something that it managed to
weather the storm here but i am not
pessimistic about my future chances
really uh
so the peacock was kind of an important
part of the strat here
i think you get sold
i would rather have this one i think a
peacock comes out
we do still want to buff the dodo that's
important because the dodo kicks it
forward
i think we the ox no longer really works
here
although you could ox something and then
play an ox and then kill something in
front of it to get melon armor but
i mean i say butt and that's the
realization that it's like an
interesting play at minimum
[Laughter]
could be good
um
you know
i think given how important scaling is
for
this build right here i do not mind
trying to roll a little something like
this and then like this is weird
i guess i would rather
stat up our no
it's
we want actually you know what we want
double stats on our dodo even at the
cost of our peacock for a round freeze
the garlic armor
yeah because the dodo kicking it forward
is going to be worth more so anytime you
get a chance to invest in the dodo
scaling let me rephrase anytime you get
a chance to invest in scaling the dodo
is probably the right place
so we
live
we die
but
we do kill the kangaroo
um with our peacock
barely
that's very important
and then i think this is a draw i think
your badgers like just strong enough
it's okay i'm not sweating it man that's
that's
that's life
that's life in this mixed up world
give me a combine
give me a uh
give me a garlic
we know we need to buy a unit right
we're not we don't have a tier three
we're unlikely to get one
so we're gonna roll looking for
something better
we're gonna do the same
silly thing we did last time
now our dodo needs to get to level two
the buff on the peacock is nice but the
camel is really our our damage dealer
right now if our camel gets owned early
it's very bad for business
on the bright side the peacock with the
garlic armor lets us live long enough to
do that and then we we trade dodo for
peacock
and we kill the monkey and we live okay
so that that is a a data point it's
merely one data point but it's a data
point that lets me start to think that
we're getting ourselves out here
this is nice as well quite frankly we
can
why am i feeding pears to you instead of
you and
look we can worry about that later give
me some milk mountain goes to dodo
sell me
buy me some milk mount goes to dodo
sell me
we could have done this slightly
differently
no questions there
rhino is kind of interesting
rooster
it's kind of interesting
forgive me i think you gotta roll for
something a little bit deeper
um and you freeze this for now i think
you buy another cow and you just
do one of these um
i understand it's mostly only benefits
our peacock which is not great for us
you know what i'm gonna
if it ain't broke don't fix it roll me
freeze me get a 22-23 dodo when that
hits level two
there's gonna be carnage we we really
need some extra hp on our peacock or
alternatively we need to replace the
peacock with something that's not uh
garbage because it's not
um it's not that bad but it's not doing
very much right now
which is that bad we're lucky our camel
lives but you're gonna shoot
that doesn't change things i think
um
nor does that really i think you know i
just don't shoot my peacock thank you as
long as we're icing you
i think we come out of this just fine
it's really like our level one dodo like
who would have thought that that's the
that's the the the the river that runs
through our whole run as we get to seven
seven wins
sure
i mean you need this
that's
insane
you need this you need this
um then roll me
kangaroo fits
even though it's late
kangaroo
does really well either behind the camel
or behind the peacock
we don't need to think about it for now
all we need to know is we're happy it
exists
this rhino is is oh no wait this rhino
is a large piece
[Laughter]
um
at least it's only a level one rooster
the shark scares the crap out of me
obviously
owns
owns
you continue to be owned but then you're
gonna you're gonna own me
7-4 yeah we don't get you we don't get
you you know what that's a lot of faith
you put in your shark there but it got
the job done
so we're two losses two losses that's
still pretty good
we we need to go up
leopard doesn't need to exist
you need to level up
you need to go
it makes the most sense
i think for the kangaroo to fit in right
here
they're gonna suck for the time being
level level two or even like a level
three on that is big i
definitely feel like we need guar or we
need melon armor on somebody probably
that's that's nice
now there's a so there's the very
interesting run here okay because tiger
um
you can put tiger on
the dodo and spam out a bunch of attack
it's it's really quite interesting and
it you could even just put it behind the
giraffe and it scales but for some
reason i am here not doing that um
i guess i'm i'm over committed to the
existing build this is a loss but
this is a loss because we're just going
up against like the greatest team you've
ever seen
[Laughter]
this is just like the stats are just out
of control
now that you accept that as a loss i
mean one of the reasons i didn't want to
get the tigers because i feel like tiger
plus the scaling stuff is not that uh
valuable for us right now
um
because it's a little late in the game
but
okay um
well
to be honest i kind of feel like our
peacock is not doing what i needed it to
do
instead i'm going to make a very
dangerous pivot here i'm going to sell
our level 2 peacock even though our
kangaroo has proven nothing
i am going to place
a snake
and because you need to live
i'm going to make a gamble
that the melon armor over the garlic is
better and if you have like a 1-1 at the
front then i just cry okay
you peace
it would have it would have hurt because
it was the splash attack but
oh my god no the melon armor was was
good but it also wasn't enough because
your tiger dodo look you're gonna look
at this and be like see that's the power
of tiger dodo yeah their freaking uh
dodo was level three ours is level 1.1
we we did
with i think we batted higher than we
should have batted there quite frankly
that's it was seven wins not bad man i
can live with that for now thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed if you click
the like button helps me out a great
deal of course subscribe you want to see
more in the future thanks for watching
super auto pets i'll see you next time
see ya



annel did you hear that valkrae tweeted
about super auto pets
look i have been wrong about many
predictions in my life okay
i thought the iphone was not going to
take off
i
believe that the avatar sequels are
going to make a lot of money at the box
office
the most confident prediction i have
ever made in my entire life we are still
in the takeoff phase
of super auto pets it's still
early it's still early
it's gonna there's there's a
once i i said this yesterday i think
once all the content creators get there
dow gonna red light green light tug of
war stuff once they get all that out of
the way once they finish making squid
game except it's in real life with your
favorite streamers times
a billion times that's when super auto
pets
comes in and fills the power vacuum
it's the easiest game to get into
of all time
it's cute
people can watch it they know what's
happening right off the bat it's not
like other unscrutable battle royales
that shall not be named
i'm ready for it apollo's gonna check it
out soon the sap pull is too strong then
it goes apollo steven septic
ellen
koji i'm trying i know them all i know
i'm all five up when it goes to five up
then it goes to tommy in it then it goes
from tommy in it to dream and then on
the other side it goes from stephen
septic to hafu and then it goes from
hafu to the the to fusely and then it
goes out to the offline tv house and
then
that's how it goes man him hit me her me
him him me him her me
okay anyway we're ready to get going
here
and we're positioned at the top of the
totem pole
[Laughter]
at least until apollo starts playing um
fish is good otter buffs the fish you
love to see it cricket piece of garbage
nobody cares for it um
second fish freeze me him me him him me
this is a this is a good squad early
dude give me the tropical shirts
thank you uh an anonymous gifter
for
uh a hundred gift subs thank you
[Laughter]
what can you say uh thank you much
appreciated
that's a believer right there
thank you for that gift subs anonymous
an anonymous
thank you
i don't know what to say
appreciate it though moving up to
the the rankings also known as the
leaked personal data um you could you
know what one man's leak is another
man's scoreboard that's what i've always
said
um do you own any hawaiian shirts irl
i don't um i've never been a hawaiian
shirt kind of guy to be honest with you
i don't i don't like wearing a button
here's the thing
i
um my body doesn't hold right now the
things
in the position they're supposed to be i
need a shirt
that locks that in so a hawaiian
shirt very letting it free flow
is not where i want to be
yet
i feel like i i need a shirt that's
tight it's made of
brown shirting fabric and it lock it's
like spanx's things into place
at what age does that start happening
i don't i feel like if i invented the
segway you could wear hawaiian shirts
like palmer lucky the oculus ceo he
probably started wearing hawaiian shirts
when he was like 16 years old
i'm just not there yet i'm not ready
now
um
not my organs
you know it's the just the just the
extra stuff on the top the packaging uh
we got to go faster here okay we don't
need to buy a fish yet but we could we
probably sh we probably should and then
we can just combine later then we roll
i'm not afraid
i think you buy this
that's not what you wanted to see happen
i think you freeze this
and then i think you add a bee to a fish
this is a squad you don't want to roll
up against let me tell you
drip or die i am seriously thinking
about getting some patrick lione
sunglasses
the morpheus meets macho man randy
savage sunglasses
this this squad is nasty man look at
this
okay now
dodo is worth again this is not going to
be
that donkey donkey donkey donkey dunk
okay watch this okay we know we're going
dodo so here's how you start the dodo
train come on ride the train and ride it
you buy this then you get the combine
because it makes your dodo stronger
then you leave that camel there for a
moment
and you do
the combine into a buy we have learned a
valuable lesson the combined into a buy
this is pretty good um
we need to oh we can't really fill our
squad right now that's okay a whale i
think is freezable and a camel is
temporarily playable
and we'll just roll
like this
and we're gonna put an apple on the dodo
oh right that's not how that works
because i knew i'd get a kiss always got
mad when the class was dismissed i had a
10 win game last night by the way and
you know what what worked with my 10 win
game you're gonna laugh
because it's the second time it's
happened in recent memory i just had a
big freaking swan man one one big swan
did
enough
it just it got it it was the same build
that i ran recently it was like a big
swan
uh that had been buffed by a penguin for
like you know 20 turns or something like
that swan me
easy win three wins already are you
seeing this
are you seeing the weight that we win
the game
that we win that game
dire dire docks man i mean how can you
it's it's indisputable
i like it i don't i don't like them i
don't think we need a whale yet we can
get one later
laugh all you want okay
this is a sell me
by me
sell me
i wanted that to hit the dodo buy me
buff me situation
we're investing in some
getting some stats early on
instead of just wasting all of our money
rerolling hey you never know when that
plus one plus one on the dodo could uh
could do it for you nice shot wow level
one mosquito that's gonna do some
serious work said no one ever
is gonna do some nice work level one
level one mesquite
you've got a level one mosquito
i thought their hedgehog was gonna kill
me too
um we're fine
okay um we know we don't want a hedgehog
long term that's okay it's not a buy me
sell me meta it's definitely a by me
meta
it's definitely a buy me meta it's
definitely a
garlic me meta
frees me another garlic it's like so
insanely valuable early i got to be
honest i think you can roll a blowfish
in the position of the swan move the
swan back one camel's gonna make it go
freaking wild
it's a great day to be a believer right
now
nice sweater king thanks i in the mirror
in my eyes i look exactly like chris
evans
just don't ask me to take the sweater
off
owns
no horse equals i i don't sweat this
owns
perfect that's perfect timing
this is an easy win
easiest win i've ever seen
blowfish is a worse hedgehog
source dude just trust me
how about a swan
what's that five wins
five wins okay big whoop um i mean this
is your gimme
uh you know the deer is okay
and i wouldn't say amazing but it's got
some it's got some okay ability
fish is gonna go at some point
giraffes not the play although giraffe
dodo can be fine but
i'm not sold on it just yet spiders
flamingos i sleep we buff a dodo i'm
looking for some dodo man
like we level one dodo needs to go a
step further
now that's nasty luckily we trade with
their fish they have anything going on
after that fish
crab's not too bad
crabs crabs kind of horrible this looks
like a big loss however purge me some
melon armor
and then he gets it right back did you
see that do you see how he gets it right
back
well this is a loss against the wet
turtles the aptly named wet turtles
why give melon armor to the ox dude
honestly you're you're a little you're
sleeping a little bit okay melon armor
on the ox usually is a result of pilling
something in front of the ox which also
gives it an incredible buff
not just the default melon armor but
also like uh
a plus two attack ratio i wouldn't
expect you to understand
for this just in case freeze me
bro give me a dodo you're honestly like
don't be a piece you're kind of a being
a piece right now
this is gonna go ham though get ready
for this
cup that's a cupcake for the believers
it's absolutely true true hey lick my
hand drawn thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
this week are you ready for this
the hippo is gonna go buckwild
this is the perfect build
the milky chunks disgusting name truly
disgusting
uh thanks for the beef i was worried we
would actually die to that ox really
appreciate the bee thanks for your help
are still gonna die to the ox
but it's still pretty good
[Laughter]
all right we can do this look at that
no sweat
even go i'm starting it's like slay the
spire i'm at first people were like are
you going to um
ever play on high speed and i was like i
would never it's impossible to follow
and now i'm like
man
i don't even think i could play on
normal speed anymore it's too slow for
me
now i know i froze the blowfish i'm
actually starting to agree with chat
that for this run
for this run specifically
i don't see the value of that blowfish
yet i think we're going to hold the swan
we're going to hold a camel we could
absolutely
and get ready for a can here
we don't have 12 oh actually we will
have 12 gold uh pear is nice too but
this is a big
this is a big turn for us okay so we're
not going to be able to afford the pair
but everything else is going to slap
get ready for this
okay now this is going to suck
temporarily this
mh gamer is going the distance
[Laughter]
a penguin plus all tier two units or
level two units equals enjoy your win
i'll just yeah go ahead enjoy your win
it's gone they we're not getting that
one you you got the dream
we're actually kind of close to it
ourselves
but we're not quite there yet we know
that's a sell
um let's do our first buy
the only thing that that annoys me is
that the dodo's not there but i i
actually believe
in the penguin i do
i think you can roll penguin even though
the penguin sucks the scaling is going
to get crazy
yeah we should have canned them that's
that's definitely true
unfreeze me i mean we just can next the
penguin
does n the penguin is not an exist
uh it doesn't exist to kill it exists
just for its buff as long as it lives
through the shop then you got nothing to
worry about
get one of the tier sixes tell me you're
a three win marty without telling me
you're a three win marty
three win marty d
okay this is good stuff
freeze cat good one um
oh
tough luck on your worm here ah you
almost had it
geez louise you hate to see it
and then your hippo well i'm you but
stronger uh level two hedgehog
inspires a a moderate amount of oh never
mind we lost okay
just give it a second okay
this is we've invested in our scaling
unfreeze me
unfreeze me
we need a level 2 dodo it's that simple
let's as long as it hits the hippo i'm
happy there we go freeze me you son
buy me
roll me
freeze me
here's our scaling
and now we get to go up against all the
losers like me who have their uh
they're on their last life so we should
be fine
i see big plays i also see trees of
green red roses too
i see a shark
i'm not that afraid of this shark just
yet
the shark it doesn't have many units
that are spawning off of it right now
and our hippos scaling like a son of a
gun
and this this looks beautiful to me
that's a baby shark right there
we almost lived there too
all right so we got to do 13 damage to
you turns out the swan strongest unit in
the game
camel needs more hp you just you got to
believe okay it just takes time
the camel will get there they just need
more hp right now to buff the swan
give me the dodo you piece
come on we have so many rolls
that's that's a a must buy
it's a must buy man keep that pair
frozen
i know the monkey is an interesting idea
you could sell a swan to roll a monkey
you could sell a dodo to roll a monkey
sell them sell the penguin to get a
monkey
why would i want four plus one plus ones
when instead i could just get one plus
two plus two
i mean i'm just going to be honest i
like it as is i think this can still
work
as long as we break even here your snake
doesn't get to pop
let's go we're alive camel actually got
an ability
that doesn't happen too much
that's a big play turkey shark is a
scary build but they're they're in like
two different archetypes right now
i'm not sold on the idea that this is
gonna work for them quite frankly
i think we draw no actually
yeah we draw okay that's fine
because we have amazing scaling that's
dude i saw a turkey and a shark but they
didn't quite have it going on
you you know it and i know it they
didn't quite have it going on this is a
roll me
i i believe in our power right now i i
believe we're reaching the point where
melon will surpass garlic we already
crush a white weeny build which garlic
is the best at defending um
keep rolling me there's we change very
little here
a penguin is worth the buy
i'm not sold on buying a camel when
instead i'll invest in our hippo okay
we get a little stronger every turn we
need that dodo man that
when the level two dodo getting getting
buffed for plus two plus two is insanely
valuable for us okay this is not great
[Laughter]
your hippo your hippo's gonna run wild
on us there's no doubt about it okay
melon armor turtle i can't be mad it did
some work
still believers get paid out
six wins or more we got seven
that's good stuff
cat would have been amazing i understand
like when you lose on turn six every
time every time you see a tier six unit
you go oh my god that's gotta be like
the best unit that's ever existed you
you need to prioritize things based on
where
you're at based on where your opponents
are at there's a whole different there's
a lot of things going on okay
like i was losing it a little bit in the
uh
in the tier list when people are like he
has beaver over cat and you're like well
if on turn one
if if a cat showed up i would buy a 6'5
cat over a beaver for sure but you know
they they don't they show up in the late
game and you're like it's a little late
man
dragon for me is it can be great you
just need the capacity which is hard to
guarantee at that point in the game
now
this is tough okay
horses early can function
but i don't love them but two of them at
least
you know there's something to be and
then i guess
you buy well you could freeze a mosquito
and then roll me that's what we're
looking for forget forget the duck for
now we've already invested
instead we get a fish that comes out and
is mercifully
a 4-3 but i still think you probably
lose round one
the lush bushes
four three fish is good but man a three
four would hit the spot oh man
oh
man lose into a duck round one you hate
to see it but you know what it's we knew
it was likely
or at least possible
i definitely think this is how you roll
this you get a fish out there
you get a cricket out there
you
roll once because if this gets replaced
with a b we'd be okay
this should be a draw at worst
this is an oh this is a a platonic ideal
squad for this team don't shoot my horse
thank you thank you
i'm them but stronger i think
look at that oh we 3-1 trades with a 5-3
now we're talking okay 1-1
this isn't great just to be
honest with you um
i think we can at least roll
this for a second but we definitely wish
to dump this cricket now that it's a one
two instead of a three two
the thinking
i'm thinking okay
sell me
by me
freeze me i i don't mind rolling a 3-2
temporarily
roll me
freeze me unfreeze me
buff me
i accept this then we use we probably
combine horses get ready to sell them
maybe we sell first because they'll sell
for two instead of one
and
we pill the flamingo in order to buff
our dodo permanently
and then all we need to do is on like
last time actually have like a level two
dodo have a chance to show up
this is a draw which is hilarious
no it's a win because the horses will
buff the bee get owned
interesting okay so first this is a cell
so that
we can do
this first okay just get ready now we
get a nice buff it's only for one turn
whatever right then we get a nice
buff then we combine
and you're not long for this world
we
put the whale
behind the flamingo
we'd still get ready to kill you in a
turn or so i think you can add a fish to
this squad that doesn't bother me
i think you might even want to buff that
flamingo we'll see for now two wins i
think three is possible maybe not
guaranteed but possible but hey the
horse is also gonna buff the flamingo
when it comes back out on the second
pass would you look at that
this this squad is gonna be nasty the
the illegal housewives they're gonna be
nasty in a few turns i'm glad we're not
uh fighting them in a few turns i'm glad
we're fighting them now
three one becomes a four one
buffs everybody which means our dodo
will not die in one hit which is insane
which means our dodo actually trades
with the peacock instead of the elephant
you're gonna be scary next year
not this year though
oh baby
[Laughter]
um we could get a level two horse
and it would what turn is this five
that would kick-start us one level up i
mean here's the thing if we buy it for
one we sell it for uh
two so it's a pretty easy it's basically
like getting a small reroll
and then i think we do say get out of my
face
and we probably do
purchase
a dolphin regardless i think it's it's
acceptable to run it
temporarily um
i'm a simple man do just hit me with a
buy me buy me early keep this frozen
might as well freeze that just in case
invest in some stats here
interesting squad
ooh
it still gets to do its effect i think
otherwise that would be that would be
horrible
this seems okay
flamingo
dies for for a cause
and then
it might be a draw i think i think it is
a draw but still
upgrading on flamingo doesn't work
because of whale
it still works
when it dies from being eaten by the
whale it'll give plus two plus two then
it'll come back as a level one and when
it dies give plus one plus one
it works
now the question is
i don't think it's a question i think
this is a guarantee if we're sticking
with the fish for the time being
i think you pill the flamingo buff the
whale
run a deer in front
sadly most of our investment here will
be in rerolls we have nothing else to
really do
we could buy a b but that's not that big
that's pretty good
that's really good
there is you know turtle's interesting
but i i'm just banking on the idea we
could get one later maybe we'll freeze
one of those oh
it's not a piece it's not a piece
it's the opposite it's the whole damn
pie
this build looks like uh a bus is gonna
do some serious work on it
you pie
i'm not too worried about the blowfish
two damage
big whoop
send it
send it
oh man
this is a win for sure dude it's a good
day to believe
and we got space like we can dump the
dolphin no sweat
it's not a can situation just yet you do
one of those now the deer gets stronger
which is not that relevant we could put
the fish in front instead
knowing that the dolphin is going to be
sold at some point
we are going to
keep you frozen
buy a can roll once
i'm happy with the situation we got
i know i know i know
justin did it one time
worm could scale
it's a big investment though
penguin
like
if scales are dodo scales are fish those
are both pretty big
whale might get their revenge you know
what i think you i think you've sold me
i think you've sold me on the
possibility of a penguin
maybe
being functional here
penguin i i reject the notion that i uh
don't respect the penguin my last two
ten spots were with the penguin on uh
on mobile
this is a nasty squad like that that
peacock is mighty strong
but it doesn't get any tankier you know
it just gets uh
it just gets more attack this is a loss
man this is a that's a nasty
it's a nasty build
good god
all right
hey you know what they're doing
something with food build which is very
it's respectable
two lives remain
so i think it's a sell me
buy me
buy me
roll me
buy me
don't i don't have anywhere for you to
fit i wish i did
dump the fish how about you
enough said
i would never the fish is part of our
scaling right now we don't need the
penguin if we don't have the fish i
promise you when this fish gets to like
30 30
i will check your chat history and be
like this is what you get for being a
doubter
i don't like seeing uh oh it's a scampi
build
this is okay with me we've made it
through the the most annoying units
those shrimps at the back are gonna get
cramped on here
this is a win let's go
full scampi
the little crab little crab on top
um keep that frozen we really want the
level 2 whale
changes everything
keep in mind this this is the believer
play rate here they really want me to go
shark and honestly it's hard to argue
against it when you're just rolling past
things over and over
roll me one more
time i don't think i need to tell you
that you're a piece but there you go
okay this one's for the believers
the thing again like with with like a
shark oh this is a
disgusting build this is the kind of
build when you're angry you just when
you get them you're just angry like look
at this
turkey
camel rhino like i i would be stunned if
we made it past the rhino
i feel like the rhino is going to go
buck wild on us
it is level two so yeah it's gonna you
you peace
it goes without saying you peace
it's just a nasty team
this is just i mean there's great shops
you know you get a turkey early define
your run by that you're in a great spot
we once we get this level two whale i'm
telling i'm
i'm freezing
i'm psycho i'm going psycho
okay
we kind of got it
okay this is big i know i know there's a
turkey there okay everybody chill
i'm i'm sorry to get rid of my scaling
on the penguin
but it will be this is
i i want you to know
this is done
because if we sell the fish
we lose this next round imo and this
next round is for the believers i'm
sacrificing
my future
potential to probably have a good chance
to win
10 rounds in order to do right by the
believers okay
that doesn't mean
we're gonna win right away
but we need to try to win this round
otherwise we're going down
now this is a spooky squad
there's no doubt about that
but the turtle's gonna eat it a little
it's gonna buff an ant which nobody
cares for oh that's huge man
please
please
that's fine
we win pay out the believers
[Laughter]
okay now
how the heck are we gonna get ourselves
out of this
probably looks something like this
sell me
the problem now is if we sell the
penguin
i mean sell a fish
it moves the dodo up one
no matter what unless you put a penguin
here which i don't respect too much
maybe but we need scaling
honestly if we're going to go further
the whale probably has to go at some
point
this
you're right this will get sold
we just got to think about what happens
next okay
hp is more important than attack so like
the reason i would want to buy the cat
is to go like cat
food but then the food goes on the dodo
and then it only gives attack attack's
good
but we need some defenses you know what
i think we can roll this
temporarily
and then do something like this
and then this
and we get the added benefit if this
doesn't work of maintaining the moral
high ground because i i
took chat's suggestion which puts me in
chat's position
it means that if this loses i get to be
like no we should just run what i was
gonna do it probably would have worked
it's a it's a privileged position to be
in and i i look forward to it
two melon armors huh
this this is one of those things that
looks worse than it is
again they they have a lot of attack oh
no they're gonna beat us okay
but we
look we didn't lose by as much as you
would think that we did
if if one unit lives a little longer
we wipe their squad which is how it
tends to go
i love the doubters typing
copium copium like you lost
sorry you feel bad but
we still gotcha
now this is not an ideal first shop for
us okay
a horse and two crickets they work
together
but you kind of need
two horses one cricket instead
but i think you you gotta give it a try
so we can at least have a tutu
i mean this is like having four tutus i
guess it's okay
you know that's happening you know
that's happening
misty glasses also known as uh
when you wear a surgical mask inside of
the grocery store
we want to see no three hp units
we want to see a buff beaver buff beaver
please buff beaver me
you peace
[Laughter]
i
think this takes us to a
draw you love to see it
graticus youtube
this is the squad right here um
and then we'll buff you
we'll roll once
we'll freeze you we don't need another
cricket just
you know what
you peace
yeah this isn't even a white weeny build
this is a teeny weeny build
uh we get hard countered i think by
three mosquitoes
especially when one of them shoots our
horse
that could not have gone worse
that's fine it happens
it's just i mean we got three mosquitoes
you can't even say like lucky shot you
just got to be like
you know good enough
this is a
combine me
combine me
sell me
by me
pre-buff camel kinda sick
three four fish
it's better
i mean crab i mean i guess it becomes a
4-6
yeah you know
you you've you've persuaded me
i think honestly you run what
essentially amounts to a 3-3 cricket and
then get ready to sell next turn
or to combine next turn
this is now we can roll a peacock i'm
gonna you're gonna hate this because
this is you should never freeze your
whole shop
but here i go freezing my whole shop
you gotta wonder what's what's going on
with some of the psychology and chat
sometimes i'm not trying to get salty
someone said i just keep believing i
don't know what's wrong with me you just
won two games in a row
what's what's what's the complaining
i i don't understand
you're on an unprecedented winning
streak right now
when we just won again
oh that's our first win technically but
um well not just technically like
literally
okay this is a smack me
smack me i know it's a temporary like
crab debuff
this is okay though this this is some
good stuff
no don't
this squad is still solid man as long as
we don't get hit by meat in phase one
i see no meat
this this squad looks fantastic for my
uh
for my camel and thus my peacock
this is good stuff okay send it send it
easy wins easy wins
nice sweater thank you yola tango
appreciate it
you need garlic
you need garlic too honestly so this is
a roll
this is the greatest day of my life
sell me
buy me
early monkey to scale that camel is
disgusting
uh i feel like
you gotta roll dodo man like even though
that the crab is better now the dodo
i know i know okay
it has not worked out for us recently
but that has not been the dodo's fault
like look at this guy he's running a
dodo at the front
you want to talk about belief
running a dodo at the front to get
scaled by a monkey is like he's betting
on his long-term success he's not even
trying to win right now he's fully
invested on the 10 spot
he must not have believers
he's a long-term investor
um i mean we could do that too
i'm not gonna though
i am gonna do this definitely we can
afford that
i think
honestly actually i think we just go
straight into double uh garlic
roll me once keep me there i'm happy
and l what's your favorite yola tango
record i mean come on it's gotta be uh i
can
hear the heart i can feel the heart
beating is one
sugar cube um
autumn sweater
that was a great get on that one
that that rat's gonna ruin my life man
the damage is done also called damage
i respect this build
that is uh like honestly just a bit of a
funky build that did great work
any time you get beaten by a rat you
pretty much just have to be like respect
so you can roll a hippo in position one
but one of the things that i've been
accused of quite aptly i might add
is uh pivoting too often and not letting
scaling effects have a time to actually
function that doesn't mean we wouldn't
roll a hippo but instead we might
benefit from just keeping the
compounding going on the uh
on the camel
i believe in that i don't believe in a
cricket
i do believe in this
surely
this is just a net positive for us even
if it's in a weird position right now i
understand there's going to be some
temptation to move it up to the front
long term i would like to move it up to
the front
short term
i would like to invest in some salad and
thankfully it hit our dodo
i would like to freeze two pairs to use
on our dodos
i would like to freeze two hippos to
scale you
this looks okay to me this looks like a
i'm them but stronger build
it sucks the peacock is gonna get us oh
no it's not not even close
i wasn't even looking at their attack
holy crap you're dusted man
you know they're in trouble when they
have a snail on the team like
sometimes you gotta buy one but
you know that's
that's not really what you're excited to
see
um
so here's here's where i'm at right now
i'm just being honest with you the dodo
is not long for this world it's reached
the point where
it's too late
it it it's not gonna get where i need it
to go in my opinion so i think that dodo
is is not long for this world
um
and the best option
for now
is to sell me
by me
maybe in the future we'll take a look at
you
these are huge misses but we need to use
these pairs their pears are probably
gonna get used
on
the camel in the hopes that they buff
the hippo
this is a it's a white weenie squad
our hip oh killing the horse is so huge
our hippo if they even get to the hippo
is gonna run wild this is this is good
stuff
i mean b early can be uh valuable and
occasionally you'll get you know caught
by like a tricky b or something like
that in the mid game but
otherwise i'm like man
you see a bee instead of some garlic
instead of some you know steak or
something like that you're a happy man
hippo didn't even have to go man oh okay
come on now
it's five wins
we're getting a little weird
i think you gotta you gotta do it man
he's playing against literal babies i
get sweaty try hearts is it possible
that
if we played online you would be the
literal baby and i would be the sweaty
tryhard just because i make it look so
damn easy
oops your peacock died
you got a dodo in the front as a rival
that person is going to get the 10 wins
man
their their freaking dodo is going to
get so buffed by the monkey
get ready
we just happened to face them at the
right time oh believers win again who
would have thought
imagine doubting dude
oh
man
um okay now
things are getting mighty interesting
now
the crocodile has been incredible for us
and could maintain its incredibility so
one thing i'm thinking is you could
possibly sell the peacock
and then roll tiger
behind monkey crocodile at the back
and then we're just investing all of our
dreams in in this squad right here
it's a little dangerous
but
i love how this will scale our camel if
possible um we'll get you buffed a
little we're probably gonna chuck a lot
you let's be honest
i think we also wish to
let's just invest in you for the time
being because the camel's gonna get a
nice investment by itself
tiger doesn't work on monkey
great intelligence thank you thank you
for now let's roll up behind the the
crocodile but maybe we'll do it behind
the hippo long term and i want to spend
i don't i don't want to reroll i want to
invest in some spending here let's let's
get that hippo up
false it does i just saw justin using it
the other day happy gilmore made this
same shot not more than one hour ago
this looks okay i'm a little concerned
about those chili peppers but
not that concerned
that ain't falco oh oh oh oh thank you
for the gifted by the way thank you much
appreciated okay there's seven wins
roll me
i mean juice me
we're looking for hippos please
melon armor would also be a top tier
again
that's
kind of a hippo
tiger you don't get an advantage really
out of having more except for the the
stat scaling but it's not bad
okay
one up
one up doesn't really need to work on
anybody i think i'm happy with what we
got here
yeah it works okay
totally works
there you go they pay out the payout the
believers on that one i think
this one could be spicy i i never count
out like a turkey
shark build
until i see it go by
um
you peace
we trade unfortunately yeah we we have
like literally nothing
uh once they get past the first two
units
we had a chance because they didn't have
a fly
tiger on shark would have killed that
round yeah it's true if only we had some
way to know exactly what composition our
opponent was running before the game
then i would simply place the tiger in
the position that had the maximum yield
you you don't want to do you don't want
to be a kathy wood evangelist okay you
find yourself december 31st you look at
the mutual fund that had the best
performance over the previous calendar
year why wouldn't i invest in the best
mutual fund you you pull out of the
mutual fund you're in that didn't do
well you rotate into that mutual fund
you find out that it turns out it's
mostly just standard deviation and
variance that causes a difference in
performance among mutual fund managers
all of a sudden you lose your next round
if you had left a tiger there to scale
the camel you would have gotten extra
wins out of it as a result
sometimes you just gotta you gotta stick
with a plan that you feel has the
evidence to get there even if you got
busted in the final round or the the
round that became previous
now
let me think here for a second
round 12. that's fairly early still
you need some scaling
let's scale you
hit the tiger which is not ideal but
that's okay
one up is not relevant hippo chili
pepper could get us out of a jam here
this looks okay what are you sniping
doesn't matter
doesn't matter
it's too late
excuse me do we get double hippo plays
now
well
never mind
anyway we win an interesting squad an
interesting squad to be sure
takes us to eight wins
turkey's not i mean yes turkey tiger is
great we don't have the we don't have
the infrastructure to
to scaffold it right now uh dude garlic
armor is good the time has come
for mel and armor to take its place
it's where it belongs it's what it
deserves
you can freeze me some pizza it's just
sweet and pizza hello kate hello
not not double pizza though cause we
might want some melon armor on our uh on
our hippo
this build needs more than two units now
that we we agree on that fully
uh this scares the crap out of me we're
going up against the squad that has four
gamers
that's fine
uh it has four gamers
at the end
[Laughter]
oh man
that's that's kind of incred you got to
give them respect man
they had we lost to a four
stack squad that had an ant at the back
that's crazy anyway it's an eight-way
and eddie you're absolutely right pay
out the believers no you you would think
based on the timbre in chat
that we just like got bodied over and
over we had a we had a six or seven and
an eight
no big deal we went 21 and 12 just like
rush did in 1986.
now
we're gonna hit a slash
marker sap ends



slash marker sap
the sap won't let me be let me they try
to shut me down on twitch tv
this is a freeze freeze roll it's a very
unusual shop here
it's a dream come true
beautiful fish pretty birdie pretty
birdie
you roll a duck
i'm a sick frick i like a quick
trick um broken
broken fossils withering puppies squeaky
squeaky housewives you know what like
like janice from friends
hello chandler
[Laughter]
draw me
draw me
icardi
what was that that was that was friends
man
i wouldn't expect you to understand okay
this is the easiest money that man has
ever made
you buy two of those you freeze me an
apple you roll me once
i think you freeze me two otters just in
case you put an apple on your fish
because i knew i'd get a kiss always got
mad when the class was dismissed this is
probably a win two ants
if both ants hit the fish it's game over
for you whoa hey can i copy your
homework sure just don't make it too
obvious
this might be a loss
two two one him me
it's a draw okay nothing wrong with that
i like the sushi because it's never
touched a frying pan
i hear you on that one
wise men i i heard a wise man say that
okay here's you gotta do it like this
okay and well you don't
i want
the dodo to get buffed
i don't want you to get buffed though
i want the next
tier of unit to get buffed but the dodo
is probably more important so i think
you sell the duck
you buy the dodo immediately
and then you hope for a buff
that's the second best option then you
hope for a buff
that's the best option
then
sell an ant i know you're like pill no
this is an economy play you sell the
ants
and then you play a badger at the back
to increase your chances of winning this
round then you completely rework your
setup here dodo into the fish at the
front oh baby
this is good this is a good start
still at zero wins
it is an ub badger but we're going up
against
uh i mean like a badger early
it's not bad man that's it's earlier
than you're ever gonna see on anybody
else let me put it that way
get owned flamingo at the back flamingo
at the back do you want to lose
that would that was like a believer
psyop right there
now
ice meat don't ice let's go
six seven dodo
got a freaking 11-6 fish coming out of
the woodwork right off the bat you know
what you do you no we can't really can't
really roll that you gotta you gotta
keep it moving this is acceptable um
you can roll a flamingo
there's no doubt about that but you can
definitely also just
chill with the swan for the time being
you you pick up a fish
you roll me
this is fine
we'll be looking for a level up
which will will move us one tier higher
in the in the power rankings next turn
badger b is pretty good but i don't want
to invest in the badger i want to i want
to sell it but it could be a viable
option look you always got to respect
the shrimp scampi build
level 2 ants going to give out some nice
buffs no doubt about that
to the shrimp is probably not where you
want to see that but it is what it is
that's the best possible buff for us i
think
and we're looking great we're looking
great badger doesn't even have to pop
yet
pill the badger that's a great uh i i
wonder what
if you if you pill the badger and all of
the units had less hp
then the badgers attack and then you hit
n turn what do you think would happen
would it unlock like a special easter
egg or something like that i did see on
the the super auto pet subreddit is a
wash
with people uh
posting their
uh tier three bees
which i'm not knocking that's that's
funny that's funny to me
giraffe dodo is just the play
we dump you
play two giraffes
i
literally in my brain these two things
look the same that's not good that's a
troubling sign
i'm not i'm not at my best today for
some reason um but you know what
we're still we're still paying out the
believers somehow um
can you draw a clock
hold on okay do i have do i have a
pen well they're wait you also you hold
your arms above your head my speech is
not slurring although my reading is not
going well my face is not drooping okay
i feel like i'm okay
that's the acronym for trying to figure
out if you're having a stroke
f-a-s-t face drooping speech slurring
trouble standing
arms overhead
i don't know what to teach trouble
trouble something i think
toast smelling
hold on we should make some moves here
i mean just to be real with you i i
quite you can roll
a camel here
this is fine
this is fine you you can roll kangaroo
instead of fish i kind of want the fish
but
if it's got to be done it's got to be
done we're looking for garlic now
this particular round right here could
be a loss
but it's in the service of scaling in
the future
we're so lucky you're not gonna kill me
in one hit we might actually get two
triggers out of this
level two dodo is gonna slap too
you peace
never mind we're dying in one hit
that's sub-optimal
speed me
that's all right we knew the pivot had
to happen at some point it's okay
i thought the badger would kill all of
your units
alas it's a acceptable buy
acceptable roll
more than acceptable buy freeze me once
roll me
honestly
damage is good but
i also feel like our camel getting more
hp has some some serious value
we gotta pay so we gotta play some uh
pay to win at some point too
six five you peace
no no no no no
come on dodo you can do it you can do it
pretty birdie
this looks like another loss for sure
copium
i think the squad needs to be reworked
i think you rework it
like so
that's a sell my camel
hippo at the front
giraffe buffs dodo still so that the
buff carries over
now the kangaroo does not do great there
that we'll be looking to sell that in
the future
but this is over this is rollable
okay hold on you can sell this kangaroo
buy a turtle to make your hippo better
pair
for now we're going to pair the hippo
cause it's it's hp is worth more than
just making the dodo insanely strong
honestly at this point i think we should
actually cupcake you we pretty much need
to win this round
to keep ourselves going
okay very interesting very similar squad
it's a strong there's a strong unit no
no questions there there's a little
melon armor for us very important
you're only a level one ox you don't
scare me that much as long as we kill
the peacock i like the way we look i
guarantee it
thank
you now pear is permanent stat buff
cupcake is is one turn
so that was big that was a big one
we got three wins
we are scaling
we are scaling now an early shark
definitely appears to have some
playability
if we're gonna pivot out of it
of what we currently have we can
definitely afford to dump a swan
and then
continually buff you
and then a b
is actually kind of a sick buff
in order to make the shark get one more
faint trigger the kind of thing that
could matter honestly
dude hold on our turtle is freaking
cracked
wow nice uh nice buff on your kangaroo
there too bad uh we have melon armor
too bad we own you
turtle at the front is pretty strong man
that's pretty strong
so it's always possible to pill a turtle
and then run something stronger at the
front
really something tankier at the front
but
roll me
you kind of have to roll
like a turkey shark build
we're swapping out like some piecemeal
bit by bit
in order to get to turkey shark
but what do we'd have to get rid of the
turtle to make it happen
i don't know i know we you're not wrong
we don't have other enablers for it
maybe just give me a second okay just
let me chill
we took a chance on this one and and i'm
not upset
monkey we don't need this but
i do think we freeze this i think we buy
this
the giraffe is not necessarily long for
this world but we can we can pill the
turtle
get permanent melon armor put something
else there
this is going really well like we have a
very nice squad
it's mr toshi
monkey beats giraffe the only thing i
don't like about the monkey is we have
to buff the unit that's in front
never mind this is much worse than i
thought the double the double dodo play
we're one away from being able to eek a
draw out of this you
piece
it's like what do we have five four
i still think you're probably gonna kill
me i just
what would we put you know what hold on
pill me
i didn't even think about that dude
that's kind of sick
garlic dodo is okay
i i kind of like the idea
can i can i tell you something here
what if you bought a deer
and pilled it
so that you spawned a
18-5 bus as your first unit
that's dumb it's kind of sick though an
18-5 bus instead of a 5-5 bus
i'm not suggesting is good
but
it will be
it'd be new right it'd be a new play so
hear me out here
it'd be new by my standards at least
and then i'm like what if you put garlic
on it
just free just in case i like the splash
don't get me wrong
but that would be funny
so the bus will probably die in one hit
but it's funny either way
i hate this no no it's gonna it's gonna
be sick like look at this kills a
gorilla in one hit so would our deer but
did a little splash damage to the unit
behind which means we're gonna roast you
and toast you which means we're gonna
roast you and toast you
which means we're gonna roast you and
toast you
and then the dodo finishes the job
didn't even have to use our shark here
and then you sell your giraffe
canned food
haven't you always wanted a monkey
buffs the bus
i don't think we roll garlic on the bus
i still think the splash damage is
pretty valuable
you peace
garlic shark
freeze me
freeze me
roll me
do i got to be honest with you i feel
like a sheep could really kill with this
shark i don't know i'm straddling like
12 different archetypes right now
i don't know i'm i'm doing i'm doing a
number of different things
you'd love to see it man
that's really bad
unless
oh you peace
that's that's a you piece move of the
day
that's a doubter payout i think you know
we've got a little zany with it i can't
be too upset by that we did create a bus
that croc
that croc did some great work you know
if if our shark lives who knows what
happens on that one but it didn't
what a what a croc
it's all right we run it back it's that
simple we got 19 minutes
certainly time for one more
and then we go back
we play pay to win also known as bats
dunk we're not a golden poop yeah we
still need
i think we need like 5 000 points
look i don't like this
i'd like a stat heavy unit please
i know this looks weird but this is this
is the play imo
wet wigs
they're nerfing bats get in while
they're getting good
oh i love seeing two enemies with one hp
oops
easiest win of my life
yo thanks for the kind words on super
auto pets thank you
ancient necro
him me him him me him me
now that's a squad
this is this is an easy 2-0 situation
i
normally when i see three
i'm like we got no problems the only c3
i'm afraid of is c3po this time i'm like
you know what this is a potentially kind
of a nasty squad here this could be a
draw
it's not a draw it's an easy win
that's an early hedgehog though it's a
spooky situation so
are we going to roll a dog in this build
probably not
but it is a good time to combine
our units
so that they get a better buff out of
the fishes
we can we can kind of roll a flamingo
here
at least in order to get the
the combine
which gives us the stats here and then
you abs dude honestly i wasn't gonna do
it
um
i really wasn't
but a sheep and a dog are a great
pair
and will keep you to try to level you up
even though an ant is also beautiful
we'll keep you to try to level you up as
soon as possible i don't think we want
the buff on you i think we want the buff
to go like this then we're gonna roll
that's a bit of a snooze we're gonna
roll one more time you freeze the bat
this is the easiest play in the world i
think you can even hold the fish i'm a
fish believer man
i am a fish believer
i don't mind the way this looks so far
what it do what a shot it's the mosquito
of the century
are you seeing this amazing mosquito
killing a fish and then another mosquito
like we're had three wins already are
you kidding me
so spider kind of works
um
the dream of course is to
pill a flamingo to get some value out of
it
you need the bad it's non-negotiable
they have not nerfed it yet um
honestly i think i think you roll a
heavy spider build here
i think you say
get out of my face
i think you say get out of my face
you roll a bat you roll a spider
it buffs the dog nicely
you roll me once more
this is this annoys me
but
it does make our dog better
this you you know why you put the b on
the flamingo
because when you get a pill you pill it
you get the benefit
of the buff then it creates a unit which
buffs the dog then you sell back the b
and you get the same amount of money
that you paid for the pill
are you kidding me man
uh you're at least likely to need
another piece of equipment for a bit i
think
but the b costs three yeah but it also
summons a b for us you know like at the
start of the game here
or whenever we need it
or whenever it dies at least
please do not hit my dog thank you
this is a spicy team this is this is
trending towards potential lost
territory
i don't know though
because we got two rams coming out here
we do need to get
yeah this is gonna be a loss
if we live through the peacock we kill
the mosquito but
that's all right
3-1
you expect the loss sometimes when you
pivot that's why like winning early is
so important
okay so
you know you're bad sticking around so
give me a kill
ah thank you give me a cell
give me a buy
that you do here so that you get another
dog trigger then we'll combine
then
for now give me an anse and this is a
just in case we're gonna freeze this is
adjusting case we're gonna roll once we
were looking for a pill we did not get
one that's okay
we're going to
next round will be six
we're gonna freeze me freeze me
we're gonna put
frozen honey on our ants again because
we're hoping to do the pill play with
them later
please and the dog needs to get some hp
though that's like the oh my god a 15
15-5
that's for the best probably although it
would have been nice to get through the
garlic armor
you exist as fodder we we knew that
already
hp please
one and one
you peace
you peace
hp please
it's still not an it's not an i it's
enough it's enough
it's not enough
two losses but we're right on the
borderline man we're getting in there
okay everyone just relax
bison
not a high tier get yet it's okay though
roll me once
why not why not swing for the fences
that garlic was pretty big
please
the dog just needs a little bit more hp
five three versus three five please hit
the worm
you're a piece
confirmed piece
whatever that actually it didn't matter
that much
next level spider
this is also again quite nasty at least
our sheep trades here then you create a
b
we need a lot more hp man i'm noticing
right now this dog is gonna need some
more hp please
there's one
it's enough it's enough
okay a little little luck involved there
but thank you garlic
freeze me just in case roll me
poodle is
kind of sick dude the only the problem
with the poodle is that it only buffs
like two things right now
it probably does beat an ant
it would buff our ram
i think it would buff itself as well
i hope it would hit the dog
it does that at least
okay there's a huge freeze unfreeze
freeze
that is that's hope okay even if we lose
this round
the pill plus the turtle has some
serious play action for us
pill what
pill a turtle in front of the in front
of the dog at some point
just enjoy the turtle's effects until
that moment
we really get a caterpillar like every
time huh this looks pretty bad
the the sheep are gonna get their butts
kicked by that garlic armor
okay that one's definitely going down as
a loss
very strong fish there
what are we on four
four okay
you can't sell the bat you just gotta
believe in the bad
don't be mad
it has to be it's a good animal okay
i'm not trying to insult the sheep
it's just the spider is so close to
level three
for now we're gonna roll you there we're
not gonna pill you just yet
not gonna kill you just yet
although
just in my head
rain system says it's done it's done
it's done okay you ready let's see let's
put that to the test you take one of
those roll me
let's put this theory to the test
roll me
poodle me
then
it's in god's hands
1210 level 1 rooster
15 13 puppy all right it doesn't look
incredible that's what we need
that's a start
get smacked
still looking a little spicy please dog
please
this is a definite loss okay it wasn't
even close actually all right we'll
choose outcome on that one
pay out the doubters four wins has never
felt less sweet
we have literally seven minutes left
run it back start prediction
seven minutes i'm just letting the
believers know this is one you may want
to consider doubt just do the timing
because we are going to play faster than
you've ever seen gaming played in your
entire life
so prepare yourself
i'm letting you know in advance okay
we're gonna be the withering wigs
two two two three two three him me him
him me
i wonder if that mosquito makes a
difference here
or if like order made i think it's a
draw we're gonna have to play on on
turbo speed
sell me
beautiful cell beautiful buy beautiful
buy
roll
freeze roll
bye
like so okay
we're playing on full speed here
we're engaging in no thinking
i'm not even evaluating the team when i
see it anymore
i like what i see though can i tell you
i like what i see hey thanks for the win
that one's for the believers
sell me
roll
me swan me
kill me
for the time being
buy me
feed me
had to be done
we're just we're playing on pure
instinct right now they got a tier three
unit but as we can see it was a tier
three spider oh actually never mind they
have a sheep as well that's a little
spooky that dog is going to be pretty
nasty
it looks good right now but but looks
can be deceiving
wow we drew that's a that's a dream draw
right there
you definitely go swan
you definitely combine and take a bat on
your side
sell me
buy me
smack me
keep it going
this is the swan of the century
never mind
you peace
um
didn't didn't matter unfortunately
i would predict loss here
get ready because our bat betrays us
or sorry our rat betrays us yeah okay a
damn dog who would have thought
dude okay there's there's some serious
plays
fish can go
that's a
that's a buy me
sell me
run me
sell me
buy me
roll me
roll me
freeze me freeze me please excuse me we
have three gold um
buy me yeah yeah in turn there you go
okay a 12 12. a 12-12 swan that actually
hits for 17.
great minds think alike what can you say
nice melon armor
we win look at that look at that
doubt me go ahead
i laugh in the face of doubt unfreeze me
by me
you peace we need scaling
this is just simply how you do it
this is simply how it's done
you need to buy the worm and feed it
might hurt for a little bit
but eventually this becomes our
caterpillar play
we need more it's food meta it's like
just like dan said it's food meta 21
eight fish with a level two turtle
backing it up that seems not great
this is a loss for sure we're not we
don't have the the means to get that
damage out there
it's going to be rough for a minute but
then it's going to be great for a
lifetime
two losses two wins please please
eagle
but what do you sell man you sell a bat
to roll it i don't think so
i mean i'm just gonna level with you man
i think you're you're a heavy buyer
i think you're a heavy um
you you go level too bad for certain
don't make me laugh
honestly i think we're going to want to
garlic you at some point so why you just
eat up right now regardless
freeze me
sell me by me you peace i'm not happy
with that okay but
i
we're scaling we're scaling okay
caterpillar just some draws would be
nice
we're not dying on the first shot we're
going up against a level one turtle
that's not as bad
it's a puppy that they just got
7-6 our snail wins us the fight i can't
believe it
we actually won a game with a snail on
our back line
must sell the snail you must buy a worm
you must buy two pairs for your worm
and then you need one more unit so
freeze me just in case this is the best
thing we got
it's not
it's not
then all of a sudden can you believe it
now the worm is pog
2019 worm with garlic armor please
please please
three three
this doesn't look bad man
this i i look at this squad and i say to
myself pog this squad can get it done
what can you say about that
that's the the person that beat us
earlier too we're up to four
worm me
yummy yummy
sell me
buy me
moo me
[Laughter]
buy me
totally works
sell me
unfreeze me by the way
roll me
for next time for next time
freeze me my god he's doing it
next step we need melon armor so we
don't get killed by a scorpion
oh you you run into a 39 38 worm like
on this turn you just gotta like cancel
christmas like what can you say
[Laughter]
oh baby
no
he's popping he's popping
sell me
buy me
my chocolate my pear
now what it's gonna scale the 50 50. we
shouldn't sweat it too much actually
okay you're a four two two two three the
poodle doesn't function as well as i
would like here not necessarily bad but
not relevant hey
100 000 gift subs i pill the worm right
now just kidding i would never
two worms
i suppose it is it's possible
i mean honestly
roll uh roll a non-full squat who cares
man
who cares chocolate the bat doesn't need
it
look at this guy
level one cute that's funny
oops is it just me or do i have anyone
else got a 49 48 followed by a 4948 or
just me
that's that's the believer win oh baby
[Laughter]
that's necessary i know it looks bad but
i promise you it's necessary man a
turtle would really hit the spot on this
run
i'm just now we can we can fish man
now we can fish
i feel like you can roll a leopard
temporarily
love that love that sound man
freeze me
roll me
roll me
we're going we're looking for something
we're looking for something they ain't
got for us yet okay
i i can accept this
they can't even find an opponent for us
like that's that's how pogged up we are
i'm we don't even need to look at the
squad i'm not sweating it
triple weakness could be better but i
still don't think it matters
nice melon armor
just kidding
it's all gone my points
roll me
i don't even know what i'm looking for
man
i guess we should like just
start feeding our other units
why not i guess
i'm not even mad this is amazing dude
i've never seen the worm pop like this i
mean their run wishes it was our run
right now
owns
owns
oh you got us now i had to use my second
worm
barely i might add by the way a little
level three swan just so we have
infinite money from this point forward
that's not really necessary but so be it
dude
i mean we're not going to have time to
get there
but it would be kind of funny
to try to roll
a second uh caterpillar there would be
no time because we're either going to
win or lose by then unless we get like
an insane amount of draws oh no
what
we killed the butterfly though before it
could transform
huge plays that's why you keep a leopard
around man
oh man what a shot what a shot
so i actually think the the real best
play
is you sell the bat and i know that
sounds
like madness but then you just roll a
turtle in front of your caterpillar
and then you're like you're off to the
races quite frankly
that is also great
i mean to be honest with you
you probably just killed the
turtle at this point
and then um roll anything
anything at all really you know maybe a
skunk could be funny here and then send
it
oh that's right it won't work because of
the the transformation that's true
okay
i mean that's that's ten wins yeah throw
with this entry wow jeez
what a throw
we only happen to win easily
all right there's ten wins
let that be a lesson to you doubters
check yourself lest you wreck yourself
probably also the fastest 10 wins of all
time
now
believers that was a big one let me let
me make sure my wife is good to go i am
a little bit late okay hold on
sorry i am a little
late are you ready to start smiley face
lesson
less thinking i think there were two
valuable lessons there one is
um
oh she's live playing super auto pets
let's go



hey everybody we are back let's get off
this free-to-play build let's let's
let's divorce ourselves from the
plebeian
lot in life
live a little lavish lifestyles of the
rich and the famous they're always
complaining always complaining well you
would complain too probably if you had
so many friggin bats every single game
every single game
will be
i do like the folded pants
it's just uh you know that's what i
fantasize about now you know
as the passions of youth subside i'm
like man imagine my laundry was folded
and i didn't have to do it later man
that would that would hit the spot
look
two fishes beats one fish it's just that
simple
you can't be upset well done
beetle's pretty good
it's stats you know and and in this
household we don't
we don't insult stats
we embrace them
i am going to freeze a fish
and then buff
my beetle which will then make our fish
stronger not not by a lot but by
something um
and we may lose this round but i really
want to not i think our team is stronger
hit the hit the beaver you peace
it's all right we we trade then we get a
double ant trade i don't see how we lose
this you know it just goes to
i don't see yeah yeah okay it just goes
to show you the power of the of the two
three is op early game and then the ants
uh you know they don't hurt let's put it
that way we sell a pig
we could kill two ants i mean this is
like we don't buy buffs early most of
the time anyway
um although this does screw this up but
so be it
now stats are nice but i think this is a
roll me situation
i still think it's a roll me situation
and now
we're talking
this had to be bought
i respect it
i respect it roll me
freeze me oh
freeze me
[Laughter]
freeze me
i don't know next turn's gonna be weird
this turn though i'm feeling pretty good
i'm i guess we should have our beetle at
the front and a 4 6 fish at the back to
have the best chance of the double ants
but
okay what do we want to see do not buff
the blowfish
it's not ideal but it's better than if
you buff the blowfish
okay that's that's ideal
two two two rams lose to this beetle
then it's just a question can your
beetle survive to attacks and the answer
to that question is absolutely
yes oh yes
still one-on-one but feeling great
i'm gonna shoot for the moon
my hope is even if i miss
land amongst the stars how about that
i think we pill you and pray
that's actually probably where we wanted
it
um and then we're gonna just have a 13
13 fish for the time being you can roll
the flamingo but then that's four for uh
like again after that's four cost for a
one one i think if the time you know
what
actually we we could rationalize it a
little differently
if you put your flamingo back
here
and then freeze the bat at least we do
get the three attack out of it once then
next turn
i don't know if this actually changes it
but it it makes me feel like it's not as
bad
this is a win i mean i i don't see how
that should still summon two rams yeah i
don't see how you would survive this
that's a level one yeah like if you got
like the perfect spawn there maybe
so i'm realizing our beetle doesn't
really have to exist anymore it's a one
one well no sorry it's a tier one level
one
not that big of a deal um you know
there's something to be said about just
buffing the crap out of the fish and
then trying to either way i think you
can roll an early caterpillar let's put
it that way
we care to buff you i think
i mean you're gonna laugh
because i just said why would you ever
do this
and here we are um
i think you gotta get if you're gonna
run a caterpillar you want to run the
earliest caterpillar possible we're
still holding this bat i i wanted to get
out there we just haven't had a great
opportunity honestly
so we're gonna have a 15 15 fish i got
to remember in pedo when we don't have
great scaling options
it's a nasty squad here but
it it falls apart past the first two
units
which is great for us
i i think we we definitely win
so we need to find something that allows
our caterpillar to pay off right now
it's not there it i mean it'll it'll hit
a 15-15 fish which is pretty good
um
but we've got a ways to go before we get
there
get you going sell you
buy me
buy me
there's a chance but to be honest with
you i don't really see our ram
sticking around long term i mean our
sheep
i'm optimistic that you know we're in an
okay position here as the folded pants
15 15 fish doesn't does some good work
here
that's probably the best thing that
could have happened
it's gonna get
pretty messy
after we kill the bison
but because of the weakness we should be
totally fine wow that's just
honestly weak is kind of overpowered
i'm not gonna complain because we
you know
got a little lucky with it right there
but so we we're coming close to making a
decision are we just gonna roll the fish
one three two three three
you sell the ram
you buy a cow
you buff the fish
you sell the cow
you buy a poodle it'll buff everything
but the hatchling
because it'll start by buffing the
caterpillar
that's not the dream
huge
why not
oh what are we gonna sell though to fit
it that's a good point
pretty big actually
um
i mean we could we could make a 14 14
radio then we can move it around and
make sure that the hatchling does get
buffed i think
this seems sensible am i am i insane i
think i feel like early it might be a
touch spicy but it we're getting better
we let me put it this way i think we
have scaling established faster than
the average squad and we also have a lot
of wins to work with so like or a lot of
hp to work with i feel very optimistic
about our chances here
even though it's still pretty early
um
an eagle is is fun don't get me wrong
i think
i must acknowledge the poodle is amazing
because it gives us two buffs here and
then
two i think it buffs everything
including itself
cow is tempting because we we basically
create a surrogate buff but what are we
getting rid of in order to do that like
are we willing to dump the hatching
chick
because it is getting close
to create dude i gotta be honest with
you i think we might it's very spicy
i think we might be able to sell the
hatching chick
or the bat but probably the hatching
chick in order to roll
two caterpillars which is
for the moment like in the in the
immediacy of the start of the game
terrible
but potentially very incredible
afterwards
i mean i think we just went up against
the nasty team and we we freaking
crushed them man
keeping in mind as well like are you
okay i think we do it i honestly think
we do it you go here
you go here it doesn't really matter if
you soak up the buffs i'm stupid we
should have bought a cow first but you
know like
you're not we're not gonna do anything
with
you peace
i'm mad i'm mad at myself more than
anything else okay
sorry it was a level one caterpillar
it's a setback okay
i wanted to see another one there
doesn't matter if we have a chili to be
honest with you
i was looking for another caterpillar i
was like 100 confident we were gonna get
one
freeze me
we're still pretty early
you know what would be nice is actually
um and i'm going down you know 17
different lines of reasoning again and
again here right but it would be nice to
get
um a turtle which could allow our
butterfly to actually get a buff after
it spawns like to get a uh
a melon armor which is arguably like the
best buff in the game so you could sell
which is fine we knew we were gonna sell
that anyway um roll the turtle here
roll me
roll me
something we said about running a
microbe i think it's just a few too many
strategies at once
i still think it's important to save
this for the most valuable unit
i would say you know you could probably
do worse than having a chili on this
turtle knowing it's going to stick
around
and then i'm investing in roles
which i don't think is the worst idea
even though you might
i don't think it's the worst idea um
because we're winning as long as we're
winning i think investing in making sure
that we keep winning
is sensible dude this is huge the the
gorilla dying in one hit
wow that it basically could not have
gone better for us there
we
wiped almost your whole squad
and we're the best part about this is
not just that we're winning it's that
we're winning
without drawing which i think means
we're facing weaker teams as we move on
i i think we're at eight wins
eight wins one loss on round 11 is is
crazy
roll me
roll me
this is important
roll me again
we're not going for like an econ build
i mean we
again what do you sell to fit the cows
it's a good question i don't have an
answer for you
this is a scary squad to run into right
now especially when you consider the bat
okay i i think that our stats might look
a little underwhelming but i think
that's deceptive no no no no no
no no no no no
the the shot is not that bad there
like the the poodle it already did what
it had to do oh that's really bad this
is our first loss here
and honestly it's just we ran into a
level three bat you can't be mad what's
our first loss in a bid i should say um
you can't be that mad when you run into
a level three bat it's just a it's a
it's a nasty unit man
speaking of which
send me
we only need two more wins the scaling
is through the roof
if we could get our turtle
to level two i'd be very happy level two
bat i see you
allow me to say like
calling this blessed is
your peace is probably not sensible
however
it's a little blessed
um
that we you know we're running into bats
but we don't rely on equipment that much
like it's not like our our food is
really the difference between winning
and losing here
you don't need a one-up
because it this only works at the start
of battle so a one-up is not the the the
own that i think you might think it is
this is big
remember we still got two lives like
there's no guarantee we're going to the
moon here
freeze this pair
of course like getting close to peak
scaling is is a nice
helper there
level three bat as long as my leopard
or their leopard doesn't snipe my
butterfly before it gets oh you come on
man
how dare you okay it just hit our bat
that that's very good for business
this is nose i think we won i i think we
already got it is that 10
who would have thought like a fish could
be this strong
i know you're going to say it's all the
butterfly was not the fish just rolled
like 60 percent of their squad that's
the honestly that was a 15 minute win
and we got we got a 10 spot on that
that's crazy
i mean we're running it back
this is a freeze
no this is a buy
freeze freeze
i'll be the untouched
arms
this squad i i chose it because i think
it is a realistic chance to win but we
want to do uh it
it might lose the ants are pretty strong
it depends on the on the ant play i
think that's the for the best
never mind it's for the worst
[Laughter]
but i'm not i'm not too worried about
that we lost our first round last time
remember um
so i know you're you're probably like
why would you roll it
uh like this you fool you piece
it's because
next time we'll combine buy sell sell
him me him him me him me that way
the fish that we have is gonna be
potentially potentially
good enough to solo
whoever we go up against
and i mean that
in in all senses but the literal we also
won this round so even though we're
playing sub-optimally for the team that
we're putting on the field we're setting
ourselves up from a front office
standpoint to be better
so you do it like this
like this
not
necessarily thrilled to have a ram okay
but
i think you can
i would say we can roll both of these
units for a bit sell me
that's a beautiful payout sell me now
all of a sudden
it's not bad right we got a six eight
fish
which sadly we are going to keep at the
back
and we'll roll it um
believe it or not like a cricket i know
the conventional wisdom is you like
almost always want to roll a full squad
right
my conventional wisdom is i think that
the cricket would be bot just to fight
once i would rather buy something that's
likely to stick around for a bit
and can still make a meaningful
difference like plus five attack on a
tanky unit
pardon me still early in the morning
here
um
this is a nasty squad
the double dog
definitely is me thinking that a draw
might be like
optimistic but but doable
we're just not gonna have enough hp we
have more than enough damage but
i don't know does a qriket win that i
don't think so and then we'd be selling
the cricket anyway
now a peacock
is certainly functional
maybe a little overrated to be honest
but but certainly with two of them
existing
changes my
my mindset a little
and i still like well you know what now
we can actually do it like this i think
a seven eight fish is doing is doing
just fine here if we're not gonna buy
anything and we're probably not even a
flamingo then i think we'll just buff
our own fish
like bear grylls in the in the arctic
two one one three bat do not hit my fish
bird i don't care i i sleep on that
now this ant oh my god we we lived
through the ants
we should even at even at seven six yeah
we're gonna kill you with the rams here
i think this squad
i think it is i'm gonna balance
sebastian it i think it's got the
knowledge to get it into college we're
only two wins five rounds in
but my hope is that the winds start
coming
you're gonna laugh
again
um
but i think you can roll a caterpillar
and we're just gonna focus on
getting this fish going
for now we'll we'll buy a ram that's
that's an investment
we're still buffing the peacock yeah we
you should put you at the front then you
don't need the blue for some reason i
always think you need the bluebird on
the far right
i get it like invertedly confused with
the monkey
as long as we kill the peacock with our
fish i'm very happy
it would have been nice if it landed
slightly differently there but um
this could be a loss actually
that that beetle's very strong
and of course i it is a loss the
beetle's strong but then also like the
bee afterwards maybe that's why they
call it a beetle
what do we have here
two hp
okay i know we just bought
the ram is no reason to exist sorry not
sorry we'll get a turtle later you need
to get buffed for us to stay alive
not what we wanted to see
we're trying to
it's fine trying to force some buffs in
on the fish here i guess we could do it
via flamingo as well but
okay that's pretty big
forget that salad man get out of there
okay this would be a very nice one to
win
i guess to be honest with you we might
move our fish to the back again
and uh
have our our peacock at level two get
buffed by the chick that could make a
meaningful difference
we get through the first
two units i'm feeling a little bit
better about my life here
i should not have i would just
i do not know what i was talking about
okay so a hatching chick on the peacock
fish at the back
i'm not scared
mostly because it's a game no matter
what but um
you know we'll live
i think the bluebird
can probably go
in the service of
a better
unit
i mean the bison would start to get
buffed for sure
for the time being i'm a little bit like
what if you just ran a seal which has
okay stats
maybe freeze me this bison
then please please me
i'm not pleased
server's getting a little funky
you need garlic armor
okay
don't die
don't die please
we have a whole build it has a it has a
plan a two-four level one a bat
i don't know that's probably the worst
i'm not trying to sugarcoat it you got
some melon armor i think i don't think
we kill this peacock i don't i don't see
how we get through a peacock right now
well
the the lord giveth the lord taketh away
oops
we have a uh
a ten win and a two win
for a total of twelve twelve and eight
not too bad but for now thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed if you did
click the like button helps us out a
great deal of course subscribe you wanna
see more in the future thanks for
watching i'll see you next time see ya



everybody i just can't stay away we're
back we did it we had a 10 win on the
last one right there's nothing wrong
with that there's nothing wrong with
this two three
juice me roll me
um
i'm honestly i'm not angry to see a
beaver here
let's be
the edible bits
like bits and bites like cheese bits
these are canadian snacks which means
they're probably originally uh english
if i had to imagine
um this is a draw
but it's a draw where we have better
stats so it's that we'll call that a
moral victory
i'm gonna take a chance here
it controversial maybe okay
if we have
um
a a beetle
we don't really need
a fish
because they're they do very similar
things
um but there is a part of me that's like
okay hold on
what if you
sold an ant
bought a fish
or an eight cell a beaver
okay
watch this
this is
smart is probably not the right word
honey's food don't forget honey's food
buff the unit most likely to stick
around for a bit which is you
you come up to the front
you go right here get sold next time
anyway so we're deliberately choosing to
roll a smaller squad in order to
leverage it for some some stat bonuses
this is not good i see that we are going
up against the team that has uh
better stats quite frankly
[Laughter]
although i think we win which is kind of
crazy
um it's thanks to the b and also thanks
to the hp that the b gave all of our
shop units i guess but
um
it does not appear that we'll be able to
vault ahead and steal another
another tier of unit here that's not the
end of the world
however
maybe we could
[Laughter]
um
i we
can't but just
just work with me for a second okay just
just work with me for a darn second
we're gonna buff you we're gonna buy you
we're gonna do a double sell
in the future
roll me
freeze me roll me freeze me okay
now we got again this this first
or the third round here i don't know it
could be a little spicy
they did get a tear up they got a they
got a blowfish early which is gonna uh
get some
very powerful plays here
i'm not sure if that's good um i would
say that's probably bad uh yeah you know
they got a level two beetle they had a
blowfish that had been buffed by by
something you can't be too upset that's
well played well played start me
now puppy early
i say yes when i see a puppy early i say
yes i'm going to need a cell
i'm going to need a buy
i'm going to need a cell
we can roll one time
now we're talking
i'm gonna need a buy
i'm gonna need the puppy to go to the
back you can go here
freeze me
we might have thrown one more round okay
but again this is in the service of
getting a little you know it's like when
you gear up on your bicycle a little bit
you recognize don't hit my don't hit my
beetle okay that's not good either but
um when you gear up on your bike you
recognize you're gonna have to pedal a
little harder for a bit but it's it's
for a good cause
this is a loss by the way
which is not super i mean level three
cricket that's pretty substantial
it's it's not an unexpected loss let's
put it that way
now here i'm gonna need you to uh do
this
a deer is a fantastic choice
now we can't really mess around too much
like we got to commit to winning um
i i'm unwilling
to
mess about
for now i think you sell a fish even
though the stats are awesome that allows
you to freeze a bird roll once
consider this acceptable even though a
swan works well with a puppy we're gonna
buy a second bird i'm really relying on
on both puppy and uh well puppy deer and
beetle
are my game plan here if we can get this
puppy scaling you know give him some
some garlic armor you never know you
never know what happens there
that could be better
on the bright side
that's fine
um
i think it's a draw
and a draw is
is livable for me
um because we're scaling i know that
that's like the ultimate copium
we don't have a huge margin of error
right here but i mean that's okay when
you see something like this
puppy is scaling that much faster
we're gonna get going on our next level
of scaling as i i need to screw up the
scaling here that's my bad
unless we wanna ah you know when no no
no no no this is good though having the
buffalo is good i know i screwed up the
scaling let's not worry about it we need
garlic on our dog probably next
now we start to cruise them up a little
bit please
5 8 level one
this the team we're going up against is
not that scary which is great news
now
it's probably worth noting our team is
also not that scary
maybe they're looking at us going great
news this team's not so bad but this
will be a win
thank you so much okay
even without the puppy scaling we're
still in there another puppy
how dare you but also pog
i uh obviously yes it's a big one
obviously yes that's a big one
probably gonna end up keeping the same
squad here
well you know we could
okay i'm gonna i'm willing to take a big
chance sell a beetle
buy an owl
buffs this
on sell you're going to give a buff to
somebody as well
we can roll once
another puppy is is big
poodle three one four three four
the poodle is not really a great fit
right now
but like
that being said i'm gonna keep it around
the owl is gone the deer is gone the
bluebird is gone we just need to get
there first uh level two don't hit the
puppy don't hit the let's go hitting the
deer is a waste actually hitting the
bird is kind of a waste as well
this is not great
but
well no it's just genuinely pretty bad
we lose
and yet i still i even though that's
crazy they had like a four stack squad
they still beat us um i still think we
make it out of this feeling okay
sell
me sell me
that's good
buy me
sell me
buy me i don't know we don't we don't
need to do this this time but that's
okay four four
four
and it goes left to right i think so we
don't really want to buff the deer
obviously
one more roll
four now
um
we don't really want any of these
if we do we want it like that i think
um
actually we might want our puppy just
behind here work through like when all
uh i screwed up the
no because it's all well
i don't know maybe we need the bison
behind the dog
level two turtle sucks
don't hit my dog dude oh my god you're
such a piece
at least we're killing the turtle there
but then like this dude that's really
bad like
we're we're out like we're done we lost
i'm honestly like the and i'm i'm a
little salty i'm not salty like because
i'm upset with the game or whatever but
the the
just ever present bat
it's a real kick in the teeth man it's
so annoying
maybe i am annoyed because of the game
but like the
i mean i've it's not like i haven't done
it myself but the the bad is just too
strong
like
i'm not trying to hit that stage of the
game where we're like just proposing
um
thanks to that this is a draw but it was
close i'm not proposing like nerfs that
need to happen but for me like
if you want to just have one status
effect
apply at all times that's fine
what that means
of course
um
this is an interesting theme here
what that means of course is that um the
weakness will override any other piece
of equipment which is insane
uh as is
what a weird team um
but
i don't think weakness should make you
take five more from every hit wow we're
actually gonna draw i'm stunned
i think it should make you take five
more from the first hit
every hit is like
that's nasty man
big place we didn't lose our last round
this is a nice freeze even this early
though and then i'm like you can
definitely put the fish up at the front
we'll put a bat back there
um
roll me one time
to be honest with you
like
temporarily
this is not gonna be everybody's
favorite play i think you can
i think you can just buff your fish so
it lives longer i think you can play a
dirty rat in in the second position here
now this is not gonna be popular but i
do need to let you know i have run dirty
rat on my phone um it
please don't hit my fish man i'm begging
you
okay um it's
situational it's not good necessarily
but four or five and then i'm just gonna
say this guy
oh he had to move up all the way
he had to move up all the way
i thought he would spawn oh well i mean
look
we were close
i'm annoyed
but we were close that's a nice
two-piece right there
really we should roll two bats for the
time being but
alas
i didn't um
beaver's okay but flamingo is a little
bit more like
long term applicable i think we should
probably stop just over rolling the swan
like there's there's potential plays
there
should probably pill it as well should
probably slow down right we're just
playing a little bit too fast
this team though is not scary
that's a beautiful the best hit you
could ask for
and then the best buff you could ever
ask for i think our fish is gonna get it
done just by himself here
no sweat okay i mean even though we're
two losses down and that's only our
first win
the bat can can get us out of a jam
i wouldn't worry about that too much
um
garlic the fish for now freeze me a
turtle
freeze me a turtle
roll me
freeze me
i'm
kill me i know we just put garlic on you
right
i think in that case you want to roll
this unless you know do i think we can
win this round yeah
i do
in that case
let's roll this
the bat is getting a little nuts we'll
put a turtle
we might put a turtle on the bat i guess
level one turtle level one bat
and a 14-12 beaver
we lose hey just due to circumstance the
way this melon armor worked out how do
we kill the beaver we have to wait until
we get to our bat this person's name is
juice me
congratulations you you've
you maybe have bested the person who
showed you the game
and there was no luck involved
whatsoever um
roll me
squeeze me roll me
you can tell like i'm just i'm in the
panic rolls
i'm just going
i'm just going off but you know what
okay
how do we get there
it
the fish levels everything well it it
gives a bonus to everything
please weaken the ladybug uh that's
not necessary unfortunately
but at least we do get to land our big
hit this looks okay
well anyway it involves like at some
point we have to make a compromise we
have to get rid of the things that are
not winning us rounds but might benefit
us later in order to win rounds now
because that's the only way we're gonna
get out of this right um so we do have a
seal a seal buffs other friends
an eagle is just nice um
i think you can definitely sell your
beetle
now a seal is okay
i think we kind of shoot for the moon on
a seal right now and hope that it gives
buffs to the things that need buffs
um we'll invest in more fish for the
future so long and thanks for all the
fish
that is a big help this is also a big
help
i'm
please
no the servers come on man
after everything we've been through
i'm not blaming the the devs okay
twitter here we go super uh teamwood
games
the game is popular again i know i said
this before the game is popular and then
on top of that i'm like
you know it's free
all right well it's all good
no no known issues as of right now
for the time being no known issues
new no-no's um freeze me yeah roll me
okay it's it's not a must-win but i must
win this one
psychologically i must win
this team does not scare me
that's a good hit i think reasonably
good
big plays
we do just fine here
big plays you're summoning a 3-2 which
is a 2-2 which is not a big deal
uh and then okay we're making it out of
this
and the scaling is is working out there
our caterpillars get in there
in fact we can get them there
if we wish
i think we wish we don't have a lot of
time to mess around
i think you literally just play that
i can live with it
because i have to so the bird is not
long for this world
the snail
spreads it out the snail you know when
your teacher said did you bring enough
for the rest of the class the snail is
like yes yes i did
now this is a scary team weaken the
peacock please
it's hard to imagine that going worse
we lose this
just barely i might i feel like we've we
played joseph with the with the sulking
carrots earlier
now we finally hit our level three the
birds gotta go
the snail gets purchased the snail's
gotta go
the sushi gets purchased it hit
everything but the thing it had to hit
thank you so much i really appreciate it
um we can now place the bat where we
please let's put it let's put him right
there
then we'll do something like this
roll me
i'm gonna be
aiming for a solid play here on our on
our seal please
on our seal please
so i believe that our butterfly will
become a 1914 because it goes to the
unit with the highest hp
weakness on the peacock would be
enormous
that's not great but life goes on like
this this one we still have a chance
getting a three for one early is nice
but then i do see i see a very scary
deer
and a reasonably scary peacock that
tells me this could be a draw
a draw is okay
we scale we live
this is a huge sell me
into a by me
into a feed me
into a feed me not the cow
okay that's i can
just kind of live with that sell me
buy this is a just in case by me for
future consideration
we do have a tier three unit but i'm
like it's we can't afford to invest in
you
we need you to
you we need you to be good right now
basically um
i mean i think we buy this and we're
i i do see you don't get me wrong i see
you
freeze me
without a poodle i don't know but we got
four double-digit units two of which
have garlic armor like this it feels
like it should be doing okay i see uh i
mean they got four double digit units
too i do see that
but our double digits are better they do
have turtle vision
and your butterfly does exactly the
amount of damage that it needs to do to
get through there
but we gotcha i think we got you
all right so all is not lost
is that four
we broke even
after everything we've been through on
this run we did get the break even
i think this is a sell
unfreeze
bye
okay i wasn't messing about earlier big
buy
still don't think is that valuable
a 2-2 squirrel means nothing
let's be honest
so let's buy
pizza
i just need one random hit to hit you
is that so much to ask for we sell the
squirrel
i know you're like you're gonna really
roll a four-piece squad yeah
yeah i'm gonna roll a four-piece squad
okay
if that bothers you
keep your saris in a sack
would you rather we have a 2-2 out there
sure it could get a kill or it could
feed a hippo you know there's there's
multiple ways it goes down
you gotta die in one hit
level three weakness
the only unit that didn't get weakened
was the only unit that wouldn't have
been weakened anyway
but we win
oh baby
this is a triumph i'm making a note here
huge success
i'm not gonna buy and sell you just for
a random tutu
although that is only no come on shut up
you know
we need a unit we can
we can rely on out here
if i'm being honest i think you can roll
a scorpion
no
it becomes quite dangerous if our
scorpion gets debuffed by the enemy bat
of which i must assume there will be one
no
level one octopus
jeez we might we might have gotten a
little lucky here
we might have gotten very lucky here
look at this
nobody believed in my squad they all
said you're heading for a 1-4 yeah well
we're at 5-3 now
it's not that impressive but it's better
than you thought i was gonna do probably
please for the love of god
we we hit the right unit i don't believe
it um
i still think you can roll a scorpion
there you just hope that they're putting
a weak unit up at the front in that case
we know we want to invest in our bad
we just need the scorpion to hit
something that is
really nasty
yo this team is scary man
2831 seal well your your seal
beats my seal
we lose
but at least we made it to a 25 minute
long video
[Laughter]
for now thanks for watching hope you
guys have enjoyed the episode
if you have click the like button upset
a great deal course subscribe you want
to see more in the future and thanks for
watching super auto pets we'll see you
next time see ya



hello to all gamers welcome back it's
super auto pets baby uh i haven't
recorded in a while uh for super auto
pets because i've recorded too much last
time we played and now i i had like a
big backlog but but here i am
doing everything i can we are
not on the free-to-play build that's
okay
normally i i played a little bit this
weekend man i i got i ripped a bunch of
10 wins
and some zeros but it happens i think
that normally i wouldn't be a big uh
a big pig stand here
but getting two of them is nice because
it means we need one more to get a level
three something you know prioritizing
that or that level two i should say
prioritizing getting a tier three unit
on on turn two
can be quite advantageous it can be
quite advantageous now let me just own
up to the
you know what here's here's my
methodology we're gonna roll one four
five so these two pigs get a running
start
we're gonna freeze this pig we're gonna
get weird i was waiting for
because piggies is a is a team name i
was waiting for like the copious piggies
but it is what it is we'll be we'll be
the fishy will be the burbling will be
the flooded wigs
this should be a loss we have three
tutus with literally no upside but hear
me out here it's fun yeah mathematically
this cannot be a win by the way i play
on
high speed now
uh and i've reached the point where high
speed is not fast enough for me that's
that's how you know you've played too
much
so we do not combine them yet
we roll once
look
i don't see how we couldn't do this
it's maybe it's a meme
these are not oh my god they got a 7-3
back there man
you peace
i think we draw
which is staggering but i'll take it
man that's that's a dream come true um
i was i'm not gonna lie to you i was
hoping we would see another pig let's
start with this
okay that gives us a chick which is
actually very nice
we don't want to run dog
we could definitely try running like
flamingo
um but i'm a roll marty here oh you
piece okay so we can get a level three
pig which serves essentially
no purpose
at all
but
is
really funny so
i think what we should do is do this
and then
i i guess we'll just toss this bad boy
up here i i fully expect to have a
reasonable chance to lose this one too
even with a nine-nine pig
um
but you know uh we got lucky i forgot
we're in bat build i i went a weekend
without seeing a bat because i was
playing exclusively on the uh
on the free-to-play version this is
indeed a loss
that's fine we knew it could happen this
is mostly just humorous you know what we
want to see is like an early bison man
okay so a sheep is probably viable we'll
freeze that up real quick
holy bursh okay hold on ruka you you
can't go behind my monitor
is there already there is already a cat
behind there so you really can't go
behind my it's choice real estate okay
now i just want to be clear
i certainly understand
that this build is not good
however
you're missing something which is that
it's very very funny
i think we do this
this
this
reconfigure
recalculating recalculating roll me once
we're gonna freeze some pills we pretty
much have to draw this round in order to
not
throw away the entire game now i i'm not
that concerned by what i see here i see
a caterpillar which means they're
setting up for the future
um
i see a drama dairy which means they're
setting up for the future like that our
pig managed to get some work done there
you love to see it we want to see like a
bison i don't know if bison is actually
in the free-to-play
or the pay-to-win version
um
we definitely we don't mind an ant
pill you know that's fine it's it's
maybe not what i was looking for
precisely but
it's it's okay
um
yeah
let's try it again
that's more like what we're looking for
freeze me freeze me roll me
puppy i think it's
turn five
turn five with a bunch of losses like i
i think it's a little late i think we
run a temporary owl
i could probably unfreeze the ant um and
and the reason we run a temporary owl is
we can get you know one good hit out of
it maybe two if they're a weakness on
the front please weakness on the front
please that's fine
oh dude it's actually like the luckiest
thing that could have possibly happened
um
that's just a dream come true
again i want to be very clear this was
not a run that i did for ta tactics
purposes
this run is
pretty much exclusively for for meme
based gameplay and that's okay look at
that we're at 2-2
another pig probably a little bit
not that important anymore now you might
laugh
that's your play honestly because the b
is irrelevant compared to some garlic
armor why don't you sell me
we're going to be keeping this bad a
long time that could have been a lot
worse
freeze me roll me
it's not it's not the best thing in the
world
uh i right-clicked on it by accident and
screwed my whole life up
i right-clicked on roll
just resting my finger
and now it's time for me to die um i
mean technically we could sell something
like we could sell our sheep but
i guess i i don't like the look of that
instead i think we're in like you know
what
probably a safe bet there this would be
to get to four wins on this one would be
unprecedented okay
it would be amazing
maybe
honestly you're gonna laugh
we're actually gonna win this round so
it seems like total sandbagging but it
was actually just we're running into
builds that are trying to get a
caterpillar out there but it's like
it's too late for that please a good
unit good unit
okay okay
um okay
yeah
give me
and that's going to be a
excuse me ruka
i i long for a non-chaotic life that's
why we had a baby
but i need you to be a good big brother
okay
don't don't try to rip tomo's leg fur
out there
okay so this
we need some scaling here's where the
scaling comes in on the pig why we're
scaling the pig
i guess i'm basically saying don't talk
to me um let's let's go
i think the way we're going to do this
is we're going to freeze buffalo so i
imagine we're going to do some buying
and selling to reconfigure our team here
we're gonna buy can because that's an
incredible buff for life
um i don't think we're gonna buy a pair
i'm still very happy with my buff on the
pig i think because it it's necessary
for us to not be killed immediately
this is a spicy squad this squad has
some spice but you know what i'm looking
i we make it through the uh we make it
through the tropical fish we got a nine
nine versus a nine eight and then we
lose by one
we lose by one attack and now we're
fighting for our lives
but
[Laughter]
i gotta tell you
the rams gotta go i i take no pleasure
in this
it's a it's a good unit perhaps even a
great unit but in order for this to work
we're going to need a bison
we're going to need to buy a snail which
is going to buff our bison alongside
everything else
we're going to sell the snail we're
gonna freeze a pair just in case
i i see what you're saying i see well
you're so i'm picking up
what you are putting down
the best play imo right now swan
gives us a nice little buff
food
gives us a nice little buff
certainly we want some garlic on our on
our bison it's it's not a great time for
this here buffalo whatever man i always
forget what one has the center part
hairstyle
this looks okay
it sir sinks a lot the edible feet
look at that we made it out of that
feeling all right
two bats is is a must do but in order to
do it is it friend your friend bot so we
don't have to make space to put you on
the roster which is nice so we'll just
double tap you oh baby um now this is uh
him me him him me buy me sell me him him
me him me
but
are we willing to sell our pig to make
the space in order to get a dragon to do
what a dragon does
or do we sell the chick because it only
gives plus two plus two
keep the pig temporarily
well either way i think you dump this
one
we're happy
with the dragon we can roll one time
we see no tier ones which is fine it's
honestly fine we have we have time we
could in theory also get a goat going
instead of a pig but you know i think we
we have
you peace um that makes sense that makes
sense um freeze one just in case
so we have a tier one we're gonna freeze
it we're gonna freeze it i know we got a
lot of freezing going on here um
you know what we do actually
no we don't do it yet we roll one more
time we see no more tier ones
six one two three four it literally
doesn't get any better than that but i i
that was on purpose that i didn't freeze
the poodle but i i am questioning my own
motives here
9 16 bat don't weaken my front unit
please let's go i can live with that
i can live with this i can live with
this in a big way now the
the bison i'm not thrilled with but look
at that we made it out of here
that's our fifth win
oh my god we we beat the we beat the
street on this one i don't believe it
so hear me out this is where things are
going to get a little funky
we should not keep the pig the pig does
not need to exist anymore neither does
the chick though it's it's scaling you
know what i actually think we do this
and we do this
and then here's where things are going
to get a little funky i don't expect you
to
to understand what i'm doing 18 gold has
also got to be like a new record we're
going to buy me
we're going to buy me
beautiful buff for everybody also
returned gold you're going to sell me
you're going to roll me
you're going to free you know what
you're probably going to double bison me
would be my expectation
although at level two you probably give
a better buff
you know what i think you're gonna
double dragon me
a sauropod
there's there's stuff to like here but
just everybody relax get a nice little a
beautiful little buff there
i wouldn't mind just freezing a scorpion
to roll temporarily but i do see a tier
one i'm a simple man i see a tier one i
buy it
everybody gets nicely buffed
i think we're gonna do a quick sell me
honestly i'm not sold on more goats and
i'm not sold on a goat level up i think
the scorpion at the front works just
fine now we got a 30-29 buffalo
our whole game runs through that look at
this
we'll we'll put this on normal speed
because this is now the culmination of
my my hopes and dreams as a as a human
being
people they thought we couldn't make it
out of this
they said nl your your pig build will
never work it'll never work they said
and here we are
here we are making it work
now
we roll melon
that's a must buy
believe it or not it's a must buy then
this is simple it's a sell me
buy me
everybody gets a beautiful buff sell me
it's a buff and then you're gonna do a
sell by me which is a beautiful buff and
then you're gonna do a sell me
we're on six that's great roll me i see
no level ones
and i see nothing i really like that
much
now i see a level one
we're very close to a cow working here
but really like you got to run it
through right you buy a cow sure it's a
6 8 but after the 6 8 like
um you get plus 2 plus 2 times 2 right
the ant is going to give us plus 2 plus
2 on everybody
and then also its effect in battle which
is fine maybe not amazing but fine this
is a freeze this is a freeze uh i don't
think a one ups really warranted so roll
me once more
freeze me dude the scaling from the
dragon has has pulled us out of the
doldrums i'm not saying we got a 10 win
because like i like i see a squad full
of fruits and i i'm scared
[Laughter]
however
i'm also like holy crap we just uh took
a dump on your whole squad all right
nice stakes that takes us to seven wins
um
i mean obviously this is a sell me
probably gonna do a quick buy me
we need more melon armor it it matters
more than the scaling at a point i'm not
sure if we're at this point yet
but we we got to be getting relatively
close
i mean this is absurd
we're now maxed out on our buffalo but
we got a lot of other units like all of
a sudden this goat is pretty sick
i got
nothing against this goat um yeah
honestly like
so here's the deal we should freeze this
and we should roll do we still have one
no we have no triggers left all right
well in that case um
we do want to put out one more unit i
honestly you know just looking at our
economy here you definitely roll
you wanted to freeze any tier ones we
didn't get any
i i would be inclined to still run a
scorpion up at the front like i don't
think i don't think that's bad
i think that fits the bill temporarily
this squad doesn't look that scary man
this squad does not look that scary to
me a 50 50 buffalo with uh with melon
armor
is doing some serious work i mean they
had a snail on their squad like
you know i can't really act like uh
we were in a terrible spot there like it
wasn't that frightening
i
this without a doubt is like the best
turnaround that i've ever seen a run
have
like just
and we we really don't even have like
good units
we know we want this so you might as
well get out there and that i don't i
don't mean that to be like dismissive
right like we we do have
some units we like a lot but we like
them a lot mostly because of their bats
and their stats and that's it
i think you keep rolling for something a
little bit greater
so i think we can do correct me if i'm
wrong i think we can do
buy me will put us on two gold
because of the goat
it had no more triggers no it had it had
one more that was we were waiting to see
then we'll get a stat gain
it hit the dragon i can't be too upset
then we'll just get you chilling back
here what's also great about this is um
that beetle will take like uh snipes
from a leopard or a i don't know if
dolphin's in the pay to win pack
there is gonna be a 50 50 here okay so
we're gonna we're gonna get a trade out
of this 50 50.
but then
i think we still come out
smelling like a rose here man are you
seeing this
well never never doubt the power of pig
build
you doubted it
and yet here we are
you just want melon so in theory you
could like freeze the turtle and then
buy it and then pill it in front of the
dragon maybe
i i actually like this just fine
it's it's a more expensive way to get
melon armor but people always say that
like it's a huge gotcha and you're like
okay where's my melon armor that i can
buy for three
that's where i roll and it's supposed to
show up there and go there it is but
anyway um this is the easiest buy of my
life
thanks for the buff papa
we can roll one time
we can freeze a leopard just in case we
don't get anything we like on the roll
um honestly like straight up i think you
just like a turtle here even though it
doesn't provide like too much value as a
as a shooter
it gives you really good value um
you know to the goat in particular
okay let's see as a level one octopus am
i insane i see nothing that frightens me
here
we have just gotten a 10 win build out
of nowhere on the on the on the pig
build the pig build of the century
can i i'm i'm actually a little stunned
but it just goes to show you you know hp
is a resource
we started uh in a bad spot we pivoted
at exactly the right time everything
fell into place like you know that was
great stuff let's run it back
the actual most fun build of my life so
we like a fish
i could take these or leave these
honestly i know pigs just took us to the
to the promised land i over the weekend
i've come to a new conclusion honestly
bluebird is fine
but the scaling i think is a little
overrated
i could be wrong all right
but a cricket i i actually think you
basically see it as a 2 3 that's pretty
strong it's it's a 2 3 with you know
like a sum and
will be the hilly hands um
i i've come to see this as like a fairly
good
first turn unit after that you know your
mileage may vary
the thing that i think i'm coming to
terms with as we as we come to a draw
here um is that uh
scaling
attack
is important but it's not nearly as
important
as being able to scale
defense
so the play here is definitely something
like
um
probably we would do
don't shoot the messenger here okay
i think we do something insane like this
what's what's the reasoning
um it
we can sell two beavers or if we get a
beaver we could combine them uh which
gives us one more chance to hit like a
level two next turn maybe maybe get a
couple of solid units but i'm not
optimistic
uh you know in the oh my god
i'm not optimistic like right now i i
felt like this was a loss incoming two
ants are really hard to deal with early
on if if you don't have an ant and they
do you kind of just predict the loss so
this is nice
i think you definitely you have
borderline and obligation to get an
early caterpillar
excuse me
bunny
not so much but a caterpillar definitely
um
i'm not thrilled with like
any of these other units right now i
think i would take a roll and i would be
content to see a swan function here
uh
we do not have a particularly inspiring
squad right now but we got a solid one
this caterpillar
oh my god a nine eight ant up oh because
of the chick that's fine um well it's
not fine like it's probably gonna lead
to a loss
it's definitely gonna lead to a loss we
need our caterpillar to pop and we need
scaling to buff a unit that the
caterpillar can trigger on
this is a sell me
um
buy me
this is really risky but
sell me
that's fine
genuinely
a flamingo is an acceptable roller for
the time being it's hitting the right
units
out of all these i think you do roll
that
you know you're trying to get to a
second level oh you know what our
caterpillar is going to trigger our next
tier of unit anyway that's that's quite
nice
big whoop
okay so these are these are big moments
for us
that's very unfortunate okay are we
really on one life now
that life comes at you fast but you know
what i i tend to peak in the late game
three two two one two
four we sell something i think i think
we we know we love a bat we know we're
not moving from a caterpillar um we
probably sell a uh we got to sell either
a bat or a swan
and a flamingo
in order to make poodle pop so i do
think you sell swan
though it doesn't bring me great
pleasure
i know we said we were gonna kill the
flamingo but for the time being we could
also just take a buff on it
uh and then roll me
you're a tier three
we already have a tier three but the
tier three that we have does not need to
be buffed
okay this is strange
um
i think this is the way i want the buffs
to go down
this is strange um but i genuinely think
this gives us the best chance for
success in the future it could mean that
we die
right now um which would be pretty
devastating to go completely winless
i think that we lost the battle of
weakness there um but as long as we kill
the dog
i'm not feeling too bad about our
ability to draw to win because the
caterpillar's getting frickin chunked
man
okay
okay and you're getting buffed right
you're a three oh no the caterpillar is
getting it instead
well you know actually in that case we
could do it like
caterpillar with the front is not
amazing obviously but
it's something
we a buffalo is a tier four
i think it it is
necessary for us to sell the fish
and then put a buffalo up at the front
i'm just gonna
honestly like
just take it for now
who gets buffed
i hate the the the poodle buffs itself
and before the the buffalo maybe that's
just the kind of person i am i would
look to put on somebody else's oxygen
mask
before my own i know that's on the
airplane they say don't do that they say
don't do that put on your own oxygen
mask first to which i reply
i paid for this ticket you can't tell me
what to do
it's never happened okay thankfully but
you know we'll see in the moment so this
caterpillar is about to pop be really
funny if we just peeled it
but no we're probably um we're facing
some some strife here
i think we need the buffalo
like it's so bad man it's it's so
unbelievably uh bad like this
and you're level three
yeah no this is good because we don't
want the fish to get buffed necessarily
we don't have any level ones which means
we could try to get a level one popping
but i i i think some scaling
kind of makes sense
kind of need garlic on our buffalo more
than anything else i mean this
we're investing in just winning this
round ideally
and then our caterpillar will pop we'll
get like one great unit if we get a
super good unit
the dream there is that we can just
focus all of our scaling efforts on it i
mean our bison could be that
at least we draw
the the draw is potentially a win for us
but we gotta we gotta ball out
real quick
real quick
now the problem is what do you sell to
make this work and there's only one
answer it's the tropical fish even
though i've invested so much in it
so you sell the tropical fish you buy a
cow
the cow then allows you
to buff your bison
and then you sell
and there is a buy sell benefit on this
this is not i mean we're not running the
dragon build yet but at least getting
some extra stats out of that for two
gold
play plus the the trigger on this is
pretty nice
these are not worth it
this is worth it and we need you to stay
there you're a tier three unit so you're
gonna steal buffs from the
caterpillar but we don't care if you get
a buff really now that i think about it
and i think we'll just raise your stats
so our caterpillar has better stats by
the way i recognize that our caterpillar
is gonna lose the meat when they level
up we bought that just to win a round if
if we didn't we would have game over it
so i i stand by it
our weakness did not land nicely
um but we will trade with the puppy and
that's gonna get us a win and some
encouragement that maybe we're starting
to
starting to start to get out of this
um a microbe is fine if you roll it with
a turtle but we don't really have the
space to to make this function
sure
and i don't love a sea a seal here
either at least like without cans i do
understand that when we buff the seal it
would buff
two other random friends which could
also
really speed up our scaling but i just
don't think it's quite there yet
i do think we can afford a can because
we are gonna be replacing our turtle
with something
in the future not yet
garlic is pretty important
look for now i love a turtle okay we may
regret this but i do think we can roll
cow
milk milk i i'm gonna tell you straight
up i was gonna roll garlic
but then we turned it into milk but
that's okay
um even if we don't get garlic here
because we get our turtle back
and i think that was reasonably okay
scaling at some point we're going to
want to dump this poodle as well i don't
know from there yet i see a level two
bat i anti-pog
um
sucks that it stays applied to our
butterfly but it makes coherent sense
i'm not upset about it but
it's just unfortunate it looks like
we're still coming out here okay
i mean you know i'm already starting to
think about how like on our last run we
managed to pull out of the the tailspin
this is a no-brainer
t-rex if you have three or more gold
buff all of your other friends
yeah yeah yeah freeze me and then roll
me into a pill
one more time we really really want to
see a pill man
um so freeze me
doesn't really matter where you go but
this is the same build as our last build
now
it's just using the t-rex instead of the
dragon
um
i don't know if this is better or worse
right but here we are
we do definitely do not mind this trade
early on that it wasn't even a trade
especially because we we ruined the
scorpion i just noticed
beautiful place all right so at the very
least
we've pulled ourselves into a 50 50
after losing so many rounds early
for now i definitely think you can roll
a little garlic we can roll one time and
then freeze which you like
it is what it is
and then scale me we we hit our scaling
engine i'm happy to be at four wins okay
like even that is all right we run into
one amazing team it could be this
we run into one amazing team it all
falls apart
i don't know this looks
this looks pretty great it's squeezing
tees sorry
sorry to to ruin your day like that but
look at that still cruising here still
crazy after all these years
level three bat would be pretty sick
i know what you're thinking one more
caterpillar you know what i'm thinking
absolutely not
on the other hand
no i don't want to dump a poodle to do
this the poodle's giving us some awesome
scaling i honestly think you just buy a
can because you need to stay at three
gold to get the t-rex scaling
our poodle is very close to being able
to go it's our weak link right now
on the other hand it keeps going up
against scorpions which is like not so
bad
three melon armor you peace
it's all right that's all right that's
all right we're not sweating it because
look at that
our t-rex also will go at some point in
favor of a unit that just kind of gets a
benefit for existing
um like the bis it's too late for the
bison to scale i think is is the problem
there so the the melon armor is a big
upgrade
um
you know you know how it is you
basically just buy sushi here
keep yourself going we're up to six wins
the the scaling factor has has come in
now this is a squad we want to weaken
that puppy i do not see a weak puppy
that's unfortunate i do think we end up
trading with the puppy which is just
fine man
and then
we end up trading with the swan
and we end up winning this round look at
that okay that's seven wins and we're
somehow someway we're getting there i
definitely think we invest in a can
because we are going to be replacing
some of these units at some point that
point has not happened yet we invest in
some pizza
got some very strong units chilling here
the the bat level three would be nice
melon armor on the bad is of critical
importance we've overridden your steak
which means i'm gonna live
um but then it's gonna get a little
spicy but then
then it's gonna get a little anti-spice
fuel
okay
this close though that's 17 wins
in two runs pretty solid hope you've
enjoyed the episode i thought we really
brought our a game in that one a 10 and
a seven and that that seven could have
gone further if i hadn't thrown the
early rounds either way just goes to
show you
you get a bad start in your shop early
don't cry about it just get some scaling
factors get some dragons get some goats
you're off to the races it's whether you

hey everybody
welcome back we had a great run last
time i i enjoyed both of those runs
immensely um we'll we'll roll uh turtle
pack also known as free to play can i i
need that golden poop hat man it's just
a necessary part of the drip drip drip
were uh we're a long way away
probably shouldn't have bought all that
other stuff
i gotta tell you i look at this squad
and this is kind of your dream shop
early on the free to play build i think
you buy a horse first you follow it with
an ant
um
you then hello tomo hello you follow it
with a fish
you roll the horse at the front even
though that's not amazing um and then
you're gonna freeze me
two fishes and i know you're gonna be
like what about a cricket
yes actually yes we will do this this is
a normally people would tell you
let's play as the these the the edible
hedges people would tell you you don't
freeze a whole shop i like this shop the
qriket goes very well with the horse
early we'll be looking to sell that
horse at some point of course um
i'm stupid we need to put the fish
behind the ant that's just literally an
oversight my apologies um
but i i i quite enjoy this early shop
here i do i cannot tell a lie
give me one of these
nice little 2 2 that's actually really
like a
like a 4-3 and then we'll get another
3-3 then roll me
hmm
we can get a level 2 ant there's worse
things to see than a level 2 ant i know
that people are like you got to put your
horse at the back why there's no other
units that get spawned except for the
cricket as long as we have it behind
the unit that spawns i'm not sweating
them in
look at this
cricket did amazing work there
i don't there's no way we lose this one
we could draw
we do draw just barely i mean it's the
power of ants man you gotta ants on your
squad you're not losing
okay
now this is the this is the thinking
man's game
we do like a giraffe
we do
you have to think just a little bit
um
i mean when i say we like a giraffe what
i mean is we like it okay
it's a reasonable ga it's basically you
get an apple per turn plus it's a one
three now one three is like pure
doodoo but
so be it um
we'll be getting rid of our horse at
some point it doesn't have to happen
right away i think we'll get our aunt
ready to get stronger
giraffe's going to be technically a 2-3
that's right freeze me elephant the
stats are okay but apart from that i'm
not i'm not a huge fan
so right now i'm like i'm banking on the
idea this fish is gonna stick around a
little bit
yeah yeah the the the giraffe usually we
hold
uh temporarily and then we kind of dump
it
level one dodo is a very scary uh otter
in there i think he's gonna trade with
the ants which is further than i'd like
him to get down our our process tree and
we are gonna lose this one i mean we ran
up against a good squad quite frankly
that's
that's going to happen from time to time
hello tomo
a dodo is is borderline like a build
around you kind of gotta have your
especially with the giraffe so i think
you can sell a horse
get a giraffe rolling on your dodo now
you rework your whole team you put
strong unit at the front you got to buff
the dodo you don't really love the ants
getting
beaten getting guaranteed to pay out the
crickets so you'll roll me
i you know i told you what did i tell
you i told you
we will um
honestly this is not a great setup but
we'll buff our fish
we'll buff our dodo even if only
temporarily
the dodo will get stronger i mean it's a
five seven in its own right that's no
that's not that bad
i see a four four and i see a little
silhouette of a man let's go
and look at that okay now we're starting
to win on round four which is uh around
five maybe the round four that's a
little earlier than expected by my
standards um
an ox can be pretty good
like an ox behind the sheep is is kind
of a classic
i'm really looking for this ant though i
think it's this is a roll
uh i'll go i'll go a little harder on
this giraffe to get a double buff out of
it would be nice we don't really care
for this do we care for anything else
here
like i think we can sell our cricket
well buy a flamingo i know this looks a
little strange
but we buy a flamingo
because we're hoping to pill it later
anyway now i was gonna give garlic but
let's just get our dodo going normally i
don't like to get it like half leveled
necessarily but because the stats passed
forward i'm okay with it
um this this is losable for sure but uh
we we're looking for pills as well which
should give us nice dodo buffs
this doesn't scare me too much i i don't
think their kangaroos gonna pop and the
kangaroo is like the
you know it's the most important part of
this whole run for them for sure
the kangaroo is dead um
so we just need to get through a 1-1
horse this is why i'm not saying i've
never seen a 10-win horse build i
probably had i've probably been a part
of several myself
um
for the time being hear me out here it's
something like this
that's a beautiful buff
then this
roll me
roll me once more
roll me one more time
i know they look bad you know like the
when you when you spend gold on rolls
people are like it's a waste it's not as
much of a waste i think as it is in
something like tft because in tft
oh it's a very similar squad here
um in tft you know you when you save
money past certain thresholds you get
like uh
uh you get interest we don't have any
interest coming for us here so
this uh this doesn't bother me too much
at all i mean they again like that was a
pretty good build and yet the horse
still did not manage to stay in there at
the end so i'm feeling okay
um
it's big honestly this is a double buff
rhino is so huge like huge enough to
warrant
reconfiguring basically your whole run
so the way that you would want this to
work is you're going to want a dodo
position 3 a giraffe just behind
this is not going to be many people's
favorite uh play that i've ever made
i could tell you that right now
um
then you sell the whale
because it it just is an awkward fit
right now you buy a rhino and you're
looking to put melon on it as soon as
possible
freeze me please we're gonna kill this
flamingo and probably move everything
like up one position
so the giraffe is buffing the dodo and
the rhino the dodo is buffing the rhino
in the flamingo but the flamingo is not
long for this world
it getting a one-for-one trade is like
so disgustingly good for us i the the ox
is horrible for us but my hope is that
we get this incredible rhino chain going
here
uh oh
okay good trades and then you you're
gonna oh i thought you oh you know what
you only got the sheep anyway because of
your freaking uh wow we we we draw
instead of win because of the the
incredible spider plays but
you know you got the dream spider build
and it still only gave you uh
it still only gave you a uh a draw so
i'll take that
oh if you'll excuse me there's some
movement outside
i don't know is it is the package being
dropped off
and then they
they waved i think they're leaving
i'm not you know you can come in if you
want but uh
we do want to buff our rooster i think
we're in a great position where we
should probably invest in our future
so
investing in our future looks like a
rooster that gets buffed by the dodo and
the giraffe in particular but the dodo
is nice and then one of these and then
probably one of these i don't know how
long this giraffe is going to be on this
earth we really want to run into horse
builds
this is not a horse build
but it do be looking pretty sweet
just just watching this play out okay
we do kill you in one hit you piece you
almost got us this is it look they're
going to be scary later because of that
penguin for sure
um but for now we're cruising we just
got to make sure we keep the the power
curve rising here like we're in an
amazing spot
now the fish as you can probably guess
has no reason to essentially exist on
this planet anymore um we can definitely
do a giraffe buff sell the fish
buy a cow
buff your dodo
i did see a chili pepper that maybe the
chili pepper on the chicken could have
been interesting
um
i think this is a sell me
buy me
my chocolate that's the whole reason i
was doing that
should just well could we have done that
if we bought it yeah we probably could
have oh well you know life goes on i
really wanted that dodo though obviously
why don't you roll me
i do not see a dodo
the penguin only buffs the giraffe right
now
it's not we our scaling is going just
fine as is
um
i mean you can't take it with you right
so i think maybe you sell a cow just to
hold a swan back there to recapture one
gold on your next turn
why why did i think we had a level two
dodo i was talking this whole time about
how it like buffs our uh rhino it it
does not buff our rhino do you see a
buff rhino here i don't see a buff rhino
here
i do see that we win regardless please
give me more chocolate
i'll settle for a dodo
now fly is like the opposite it the fly
is what we want to run against not what
we want to run into
so i think we play this or not what we
want as ourselves um so i i think that
this is admittedly it works nicely with
the rooster but that's not our long-term
approach to greatness
we want nothing here
we want nothing here which to me means
we freeze a can we freeze the snail just
in case and then we pass turn we do want
some more permanent hp scaling we don't
have it
i guess like the penguin would have been
the play this is a loss you run into
double melon armor this person knows
what they're doing um on the
free-to-play build there's no there's no
doubt about that this is a nasty nasty
squad
um
and the the fly actually i mean shark
shark fly
uh and then with the turkey involved
somewhere is is a dream so they're
they're on their way to a great build
right now no sweat
uh this is a sell me
buy me
sell me
now a tiger
it does some great work
the problem is we want our tiger to
somehow lead to the rhino getting more
buffs i think we definitely do this oh
you know what we just do it like that
now everybody's getting buffs
people are gonna want a shark
and it it hurts for me to have to say no
to that but
but this is a plus two plus two for
everybody and and that's great because
the plus two plus two that applies to
the chicken applies multiplicatively the
plus two plus two that applies to the
dodo applies multiplicatively and then
the rhino just ruins people's runs now
it's not going to ruin your run
necessarily
um
but the rhino is a is a monster
i think this is the kind of squad we can
just invest in food
which i know you're gonna be like well
then you should get a cat and you may be
correct okay you may be correct you may
be right
i may be crazy
this is a gimme that's huge
um
i honestly think we're better off
investing in food versus dodo
because it's getting buffed anyway we
don't ever needed to spit three ahead i
think on on this particular build uh the
monkey is a very again if we had what we
would remove would be our rooster but we
really need our rooster to pop off a
little
so freeze that
once our rooster gets poppin like this
is this is very nice this is very nice
indeed
i mean we are at uh six wins two losses
i'm i we need melon armor in a huge way
as you can see
[Laughter]
if you don't have melon armor uh things
become kind of problematic sometimes it
looks like we're gonna be just fine but
we we need it sooner rather than later
that takes us to seven
roosters important
it's it's hard like what do you sell to
get a turtle involved so that you can
get mel and armor easily i think you
just gotta wait and and you know it's
common at some point so there it is
um
level three rhino could could be the
slap of the century i think it's our
most important upgrade so we're just
gonna invest it there just so we're not
sitting on
on gold that's not doing anything now we
can start to think about punching
through a front line unit and the rhino
combo just going hard and this looks
very very nice
[Laughter]
this looks
admittedly maybe not so nice because you
do have um
uh melon armor getting passed if it
weren't for that though
you would be in a real nasty spot
i see i see
well done honestly well done you gotta
we we almost had you that turtle was a
master stroke on your part it was a
master stroke
the penguin and the tiger do the same
thing right now
so i would rather not spend to get the
penguin although it could level up we're
kind of in
this dangerous territory right so you
you having melon armor is very nice
for any number of reasons um
you're not gonna need that we're
exclusively looking for our the units we
already have big plays please
please
please
do not lose this one we we could go the
distance
if you just don't lose this one
i do see a dodo
we're gonna we're not gonna die holy
crap it's a dream come true get knocked
out
okay you're you're only gonna get hit
for eight which means you are gonna kill
us then you're gonna summon two roosters
but my roosters got some in second
which tends to be good although you do
have a turkey but you don't have a fly
to back it up so we're gonna be fine
okay so we're gonna get to that level
three rhino is gonna do some work
and then
i gotta tell you there's a little part
of me okay that says
what if you just did this
i know how this looks
i i understand that the rework here is
not going to be popular but 24 damage to
every enemy when we get a kill first
plus we need the dodo to hit you so that
you definitely get a kill even through
melon armor most of the time at least
this is important now we run into
serious problems if our uh rhino is hit
or sorry if our tiger is killed early
like if you have splash damage for
example
you peace
this is fine
losing the giraffe is irrelevant
wow
well you know what what do we get seven
eight wins it's good
i feel like we could have gone a step
further though that's my bad hold on i
have a billion messages
hold on this is oh my god
i hate when you see nine plus man
nine plus in discord is like you're what
what happened
what happened here i definitely think
you can roll horse early i i'm not a
believer in the long-term viability of a
horse build
and i gotta be honest with you i've i've
though okay never mind
i was gonna say i've lost confidence in
in some degree of the duck build but if
if they're going to give me this then
i'm going to do it smooth heads it's
it's that easy
hey i'm never going to be sad about
eight wins okay eight wins is is very
nice
this looks like a loss to me
yeah it is but that's that's very
typical with duck build
or any basically duck build is just when
you buy a duck
so it's
it happens two two horses it will go it
will go i promise you it will go
then we can combine once to get a sweet
4-3
and then play another duck up here at
the front now we got a nice little three
two roll me once
i think that's a sleeper i think you i
think you sleep on that one
i'm never gonna be sad about eight wins
but uh
certainly yes i i do wish that uh things
had gone a little different but
i think we we played with honor we
played honorably
draw is beautiful for us we don't expect
to win
not with that attitude anyway
so right now two cells equals we get a
two two right we get two two in the shop
when we sell like let me but
yes plus one plus one plus one plus one
we combine we get the level up then we
sell we get a plus two plus two anyway
so i think you definitely start there
you get a whale
it's good it's good stuff
um
i think then you sell
we quite like this then you buy a whale
for sure a four eight whale is that's
not a six eight whale turn one there's
nothing to sneeze at we are gonna get
horses going here just because we get an
easy level two off of them
a flamingo up at the front
that's also gonna be summoned as a four
three or maybe sorry maybe a
five one when it comes back out
is actually pretty good now i gotta be
honest with you a giraffe for scaling is
fine we did great with that last time
eight wins is great i'm not gonna
apologize for that one um
but i also think like a five-six swan is
is chunky man but
i think we're probably better off with
some early scaling and we'll have to
roll like this for now
this this squad like this is one of the
better turn three squads i've ever seen
i would be stunned to lose to draw sure
it happens
to lose
very surprising
this is a a this is like a turn six
squad
we basically used a unit and we we wiped
them man we got a seven five back there
just chilling
you can peel the flamingo but it is a
five three i would much rather pill an
ant here
lovely totally fine shrimp don't really
care for right now you're not gonna hear
me say that too much but it's true right
now i think we can at least put another
horse out there
not
sold i'm not sold on this i'm i'm not
sold on this i think you buff your whale
even though a one a plus one plus one is
not that incredible
i feel pretty confident about this one
as well
you shot my my horse that does nothing
anyway nobody cares
mmm this is a little spicy though
although the the buff here is nice no
okay we we do i i said i felt confident
we ran into a fellow gamer
it's been known to happen that's big
though look at this
snail does work for us
probably that's a roll or a cell
coming up
you can definitely 1113 whale will run
right now you can roll a kangaroo behind
the whale
and freeze that giraffe to get an an
incredible series of buffs for our next
setup i again i'm very confident where
we stand we get some garlic on the whale
this kangaroo becomes an unbeatable
monster
they're rolling a dodo build you can't
blame them dodo's the meta man i've been
i've been known to roll some dodos
myself this our our kangaroo is
unstoppable
i i see your level 2 horse build i mean
i guess i can't complain we're running
like the exact same thing
[Laughter]
be a little hypocritical of me but guess
what your big unit just got killed by my
freaking flamingo and then we got a 1713
kangaroo just running buck wild on you
good place good place give me one of
those
okay so monkey is like a mission
critical unit you need to have it in
order to
be able to complain about not winning um
the problem is that uh we don't really
have anything that works well with our
monkey right now because it's buffing a
unit that gets eaten by a whale so you
got to think a little long and a little
hard about this i think you can roll a
temporary freeze
we really i know this looks
counterintuitive we don't really want to
build into a
level three horse
it's not a long-term solution for us i
definitely think we like this and and
though this might run counter to what
you think we should do
i'm a believer in a turtle here
i was just waiting for a little bit
um to see if we were capable of getting
a pill so we could build the flamingo
instead but
for now i still do not sweat this
their hippo has not scaled yet we have
nothing to fear
a lot of guests today
nothing to fear look at this
then you're gonna spit out a turtle of
your own
it's not gonna die in one hit which is
hilarious
uh so now we got a 14-15 kangaroo with
melon armor turns out you're dead
but the b that b probably worked pretty
well in the early rounds we're getting a
little bit past its
you know best before date uh this is big
no it's not because instead
we will pill the turtle
put some garlic on our kangaroo keep
this monkey around i know it's taking up
a valuable spot in our shop i would i
would not dispute that okay
we need um
i hate to say it we need to get a unit
here that does something
when we eat it
and we won't um
yeah um
well in that case
literally you just roll this which is
bad
like for real
necessity's the mother of invention you
know we kind of ran into uh
what i would describe as a sub-optimal
situation from a luck based purpose
there uh turtles going down that's i
mean this is a strong team we could
easily lose this
garlic's doing great work for us and and
we'll continue to i think we get the
spider with the garlic too but then even
then
we're gonna draw and and i think we got
lucky to draw honestly
you need to keep the scaling up that the
giraffe's keeping us in there but
okay we don't can yet we can rebuy a
flamingo turkey is like
it's borderline a must buy
can you see the problem with this
situation
should have bought a flamingo put it at
the front um
yeah yeah so so what do you do instead i
mean at least i still think you buy it
a turkey just because it's a five six
and then you roll whale at the front
this is not a a trick that the jedi
would teach you about or whatever the
quote is i don't know i don't watch star
wars um on a weekly basis
long story short this is a bit of an
atypical build here
but that's okay
we got a strong team you can weather the
storm i i genuinely think that there are
some gamers out there who would rather
lose you know doing everything exactly
as the textbook says than try anything
new and we're trying some new stuff here
and to be honest with you we're gonna
come out scot-free right here
so this would be where it would be nice
to pivot uh to like a turkey shark kind
of build you can still keep that whale
around for a bit
you definitely can do that
these are not super relevant for us
we're probably gonna you know what
actually we're gonna be dumping our
horse which allows us to roll a flamingo
up here right now which is is really
good genuinely really good um
yeah okay might as well uh
get some triples going here you
definitely freeze a tiger knowing that a
tiger behind a turkey with a fly
involved somewhere
pretty much just wins you the game uh i
think you can
you don't really need a can if that's
the squad you're gonna roll i think it's
a little late for the hippo right not
late but we don't have a build that
uh like funnels buffs up to the front so
i think we're going to continue rolling
with a similar squad to what we got
right now i i think that we're not past
our best before date on that
it's an interesting squad i i don't know
how to call it yet they did summon a
dirty rant for me that
i then buffed with my own turkey but we
killed their hippo which is it's got to
be really bad for them
we're definitely going to kill that that
bison
kangaroo is going strong as scary as the
first time we've we've gotten past our
kangaroo in a while but we still got the
dub
takes us to five wins
that's a play
i don't think we buff the flamingo we're
looking for something better to go there
i'm happy by the way i know people like
lose their minds
on when when you keep something frozen
in the shop for this long
that's just the difference between you
me him him me you you me etc etc i'm
content to let it ride for a while
because i know that i want this tiger
the value for me is having this tiger
exactly when i want it later okay this
double level 2 dodo sucks real bad for
us but
we still kill your whale
um it it looks pretty bad though
the bus will die
the uh yeah i think we lose this for
sure this is strong
another
another package okay it's fine
it's not the package didn't cause me to
lose you know it's an auto battler
[Laughter]
for now like
go ahead laugh about it
you can put a one up
on on this flamingo
get get a greater statistical benefit of
course immediately i'm like
would have been better if we had it come
down the other way but let's just roll
it away for the time being
roll it away you know what we're looking
for at this point is melon armor
i don't think we're going to invest in
another whale quite frankly so those
rolls were not fruitful
this would be
this would be nice
i see a squad
it doesn't scare me too much i hate
losing my melon armor to a splash attack
which is gonna happen here
but it seems okay you're gonna summon
another deer are kangaroos still popping
their kangaroo is doing some it's a
level three but i don't think it's gonna
scale quite as well as ours does but
they probably tr i think we lose
i'm just looking at this with with with
a sober mind
maybe maybe we actually win
now that i look at our kangaroo living
which kills your shark which then kills
your miss yeah okay turns out it wasn't
that bad
okay i mean you have to um
get that level three kangaroo
we're really just
there okay now that's that's everything
okay um we can't
we we have to pivot
in a huge way but it can't happen all at
once so if the first thing we're going
to do is sell this giraffe which is past
its best before date then
we're going to roll a fly
following this
it's very weird i i think even though
it's level three
i think we gotta sell a kangaroo to put
a tiger out there because the tiger
behind the turkey
everything that gets summoned is gonna
be like a plus six plus six and and
these are you know what if you're gonna
do it
just do it right now i'm not thrilled
about this because that's that's mighty
scary to roll this but
we'll also want to change these up but
these are getting so many triggers for
us on the on the turkey and the fly that
like i think you gotta love it now
what's the most important unit here
really the fly and the turkey are both
super relevant um let's let's put a
melon armor on the turkey for now we can
unfreeze this tiger
with this is what we have to do to get
to ten we maybe we eke out seven or
eight just rolling with our previous
build if we want to get to 10 this is
what has to be done i think um at least
they don't have a rhino at least they
don't have a hippo
that's a little nasty but we got great
value there and then check it out look
at
this we still get a beautiful buff there
we still got a nice fly just chilling i
doubt that was kind of a great proof of
concept right there
we made it
garlic doesn't really apply
i feel like a one up on the fly as a
just in case measure makes a lot of
sense
um garlic still doesn't really apply
nobody really needs a buff like
and we could keep a pair to buff our
whale i suppose but
it's not that valuable and and i
actually think like mel and armor on
everybody and then you kind of just like
you're letting it ride this is not a
scaling play this is like we go as wide
as possible
just to be straight up with you i don't
even know if we could fit a shark in
this builds they got the same build so
this is a very realistic chance to die
no no question about that one our fly
thankfully has a one-up which will
actually prevent it from dying to the
splash damage i think
oh wait there is no more splash damage
never mind it's not necessary okay
you're gonna summon two roosters that's
fine
see anybody else feel like we've hit
diminishing returns okay yeah hey but
look that was an eight and a seven right
like these are very positive situations
for me we added 10 787 in our last four
rounds that's amazing for now thanks for

welcome uh back to super auto pets the
meta has changed the new me you can't
you can't shake a stick without seeing a
10-win pig build now
i thought the
cacio e pepe tweet was better thank you
we're only in the first minute of the
youtube video but i was surprised at how
much the
uh cacio e pepe tweet uh withered on the
vine
it was a three series uh a three tweet
series
when you really think about it cachio e
pepe has got to be the funniest name
for a food ever made
like do you think your dad ever fed your
mom the cocky o ep of course he did
otherwise you wouldn't be reading this
tweet anyway welcome back
huh
my i've got a new power ranking in my
heads okay
now i get it it's funnier out loud oh
the people who need their jokes
explained have logged on sorry i thought
you guys were willing to do some of the
legwork yourself um i've got a new tier
list in my head okay
new tier list cricket is not bad
i respect the qriket more than i used to
roll me
i hate this this is horrible i do need
to say um
i i have come to change my opinion on
duck build i'm not necessarily against
duck build but i'm not i'm not that for
it
anymore
this is probably a loss we accept this
you know what it's the same damn squad
if we do anything but draw here we
attribute it to our hat
that scared me
i was so scared that when he's when he
spawned the cricket i got so scared
okay
um
now from here
we know you need an aunt an early ant is
like the most important thing in the
world we will we'll combine for an early
level too we might not get it going
right now typically here i like a roll
buy the best thing for this next round
so we have the least chance possible to
lose and also purchase some food
straight up you're a piece
i will take a mosquito
much to your surprise i will
buff
an ant i think it's the most likely of
these units to stick around long term
i see a 4-4 beaver little frightened by
that you know what great play great play
from the mosquito we get a beautiful
trade here we win this round we win this
round
this is insane
are you high like look at this how many
beavers are they gonna give me man okay
so you combine beaver you combine beaver
you make a badger i doubt i'm not
against an early badger so
here's what you do okay you take a
little
you get a little shrimp
for the time being um
you sell me you sell me the
everyone shut the f
you sell me a mosquito hold on i gotta
think you sell me a mosquito
like so
we like it you buy me a badger
you sell me a beaver no hold shut uh
you sell me a beaver and you hit the ant
that's good
that's good stuff
relatively good stuff you freeze me dude
this 3-5 ant is like a joke
that's a joke
that's amazing
i think you you swan me
and freeze an ant so you can pill me or
don't even worry you could pill me sell
me like there's a variety of other
options here um but this is this is
really good i think we're gonna end up
rolling it something along these lines
i'm feeling okay here
kill the badger i do i hope there's like
an achievement or something for it
this kangaroo's a little spooky i'm not
gonna doubt the spookiness of said
kangaroo
this looks bad
never mind it kind of like
it kind of like looks fine actually look
at that nice draw
we do we play fast now if you got a
problem with it i'm it's too bad i'm a
rebel
i don't know why i would pill the
cricket now that i think about it it's
not the smartest move i've ever
considered in my life um we'll sell a
1-3 cricket
give me a nice a juicy buff
give me double swan for the time being
unfreeze this ant i've decided a level
one three three five ant is acceptable
until uh the moment it is removed from
our person
we'll go with a level two swan we'll
have a whale
eat our juicy juicy ant
this is a nice setup okay like this is
totally fine
not sold on a spider
i think i was worthwhile rerolls
very very interesting squad here badger
v badger at the back makes me feel like
this is probably going to be a draw
one way or the other but
it is what it is beautiful 2-1 ant
coming out there buffing my shrimp for
no reason really appreciate it
um this looks like a draw because of my
badgers lethality how about that
yeah the ant comes back small but it's a
it's a three five it comes back as a one
three
like that's like being like a waiter
like i
i ordered one french fry and you brought
me like a tiny one like if i wanna if i
wanted a a small french fry would have
ordered half of one you know you know
you just got it these stats are not that
don't worry about this too much like if
you're like oh don't use the whale it
removes some stats from the ants like
tell me you're a two win marty without
telling me you're a two win marty no
disrespect or whatever anyway he's gonna
die anyway we're probably gonna kill him
soon
the the time has come like get rid of
this this is like
we don't need it but we need to tear up
a little bit
i think we can we can do this
you piece
flamingo fits nicely
i like the opportunity to spit it out as
a higher level i don't care for my
shrimp right now i don't really care for
it um
i will say an ox does well here we can
freeze the ox roll once just in case we
get a whale we didn't get a whale freeze
me some garlic sell me a shrimp run an
ox behind the whale and enjoy never
losing
badger at the front
this is i've seen this strategy a little
bit lately it's a it's a mighty
interesting way to play the game
unfortunately works out very badly for
your pig here i think we come out with a
dub here man
the big big hedgehog at the front
or big badger at the front is is very
strange but i've seen it work to to
decent effect i had i had a run last
night where i was playing like on mobile
i had a level three blowfish
they had two hedgehogs and a level one
blowfish and it was just chaos
it was like their hedgehog was at the
front i killed it
the hedgehog hit everything including
both blowfish my blowfish hit their
blowfish which then hit my blowfish
which then hit their hedgehog and killed
it which hit their blowfish in my
blowfish and it was just like it was
like one attack and then there was just
nothing left on the board
but i won
just saying
that's that's a dick hammer build it's i
i respect the revolution in the meta
okay
i
to to run into somebody who's not just
running like you know
whale deer camel kangaroo monkey is like
a dream come true so i i i respect the
the revolution there
now i do i respect this
i respect this
it's pillable don't get me wrong
i'd prefer to pill with like a dodo or
something but
this is what it is
sheep
uh you're gonna think that this is
busted but you can actually and you're
not going to believe me but that's your
problem um
you can roll
just everybody relax for a moment here
you can roll
oh we should have permanently buffed the
ox instead of the swan
you can roll the sheep at the front even
though you only get
one sheep from the first trigger it
still ends up working out nicely there's
no other place to to set up a team like
this because even if you move like like
for example if you do this you're gonna
be like oh i'm so smart i fixed it yeah
but because of capacity it still only
spawns one sheep because there's only
five spaces so trust me this works
better because you get the the extra ram
trigger on death which leads to the ox
getting the the play
the teacher did not misspell something
on the board you just don't know the
continental spelling you're used to the
english spelling this is how they spell
it when they're incontinent
interesting team here
excuse me
my my ox that was like a kind of an
important part of the the overall uh
squad here wait a minute why is my swan
at the back
yeah my mistake the swan was supposed to
be one up the teacher made a spelling
mistake hey shadow insurgent
whoopsie thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
two wins one loss with the squad that it
it needs a little work we have we
haven't hit the pop yet
you can freeze a pair
so this now is like hear me out here
i think you dump the ox
and
you move the sheep back and then you
roll a deer in the front space
the the easy play is sell sheep by the
year but i actually think you use this
as an opportunity
to sell sell buy and then get a rooster
out here for inevitable scaling
or eventual scaling i should say
something like this something like this
we want to have a rooster long term
uh
so having one now feels quite nice
definitely like the a whale is such a
good like um
filter
you know or a converter it eats level
ones and shits level twos man
um this is
you peace is what it is
level one hippo
we still trade with you thanks to garlic
armor but we don't get a second deer in
a second bus that that dolphin that's a
nasty dolphin man
luckily you only have a level one horse
so we're still pogged
easiest win in my life
turtle's great too don't get me wrong
it's not the tier five you want to see
i think you go like this
you can freeze a turtle
you can't really roll a a hippo in front
of a whale
so i think we would
i think we we stay where we stand we
need some kind of scaling factor for
sure
um
melon armor is like
melon armor is actually the most
powerful unit in the game
the more whale we can get the happier we
would be
so let's go this him me
i'm still happy keeping this frozen i'm
let's unfreeze this so we can get maybe
like chocolate next turn now we can
sell a badger move a whale buy a turtle
pill the turtle
get go get melon replaces garlic life
goes on move the whale back him him me
me me him me get a get a penguin penguin
starts buffing everything
interesting squad here what an
interesting squad we have here
another dolphin
dang streamers like popularizing the
dolphin builds man excuse me again you
have killed my you've killed my
rooster this is beautiful though a 10 10
versus two two twos oh
oh oh oh
that takes us to four feeling feeling
just fine
level level level me
snake behind
a whale can absolutely work
it's going to be a sell me
move me
by me
tell me
move me
by me
you know what while we're here toss me a
little bit of
yummy yummy
we don't sweat
that this is a very good setup right
here
now
admittedly this uh this squad that we're
going up against also quite nasty in
their own right
whale is gonna trade with the mosquitoes
oh
[ __ ] your shark
my snake is just your dolphin but
stronger great shot kid one in a million
whoopsie
[Laughter]
five wins baby
that's a 13 gold we we roll with the
best of them now now the problem is that
ah dude it's so important to have
scaling
um i think we can it's tough though this
is a tough one
you can
you can sell your deer put a rooster in
the front and roll a penguin at the back
it will buff your whale it will buff
your
swan which is pretty good
we'd really like to see our snake get up
a little bit though but this is i don't
know i'm starting to think that the
rooster is not really like our play we
we haven't hit the moment
uh you know what we can just get another
one
for now i'm i'm content with this this
is where we then receive like a billion
roosters um
i don't sweat this uh in on our rolls
but it is what it is we don't sweat this
monkey is not great when you have a
disposable unit up in the front we like
this i think we like this roll me once
i'm content with this you said no to a
turkey
i disrespect the turkey a little bit
um
this build is a [ __ ] nightmare uh by
the way
[Laughter]
let's go one more
time oh wait please please
please the shark
okay one more
i still think we might lose but that was
fun i had a great time with it
that's okay that's our second loss right
that's our second second loss still are
we unbelievable believers are one away
okay i would honestly feel pretty good
to be a believer right now
this is pretty good
i wouldn't mind if we're gonna stick
with the deer for the time being that i
wouldn't mind
i mean you can roll a shark here
[Laughter]
you can
you peace
that's what we're looking for okay that
this is amazing stuff
that's amazing stuff i don't know man i
would say
it's tough i i think you want to get
that snake to uh to a level
two so that it gets buffed by the
penguin even though we're getting a
little bit
that's again a little bit late in the
game i see that we have a snake build
versus a snake build why don't you take
one of those you didn't even get to
attack that's not fair at all
[Laughter]
please hit please you gotta hit the
hippo man
please you gotta hit the hippo you gotta
hit that hippo otherwise we're running
into some serious problems okay well
it's very simple we have to play this
this is the ultimate believer plate
there was there was a great turkey build
nestled in here there's no doubt about
it
i'll accept that we'll get it we'll get
a better
well might as well just go for it um
we'll get a better
bus as a result let's not talk about the
fact that i bought salad over steak like
instead of getting a uh
an extra attack for 20 i said to myself
yeah two random plus ones
that seems like a good idea
get owned by the way
tiger level two rooster like this oh
never mind
eat it believers win
get owned
all right
snake's doing some good work
stay oh a level three
i do think we're coming close to uh
the end of
this squad's efficacy
i don't see the dragon it's just we have
to sell too much we can't get rid of the
snake at this point we could probably
get rid of a 13-14 swan but we also need
to get rid of something else to be able
to buy a bunch of stuff
i i don't see the dragon working man
like it it it's good it can scale fast
but like what do you sell to get it
going
the swan yes but we need to make one
more space you sell a level two deer
hoping to get another unit to stick up
there
i just don't see it
or do i
or do i
it's a buy me buy me we can't run two
like we we don't have that kind of space
we're not gonna can yet i think it's
more important that we
find a way out of this please give me
some tier ones
that's a big buy me
that's a big sell me
i need some tier ones
that's a good buy
me then you can sell me and you know
what you could just pop a little turtle
down like here
no you can't
roll me
freeze me freeze me um
this is looking not good
on the other hand hold on i'm looking
you know we need tiger behind snake
and all of a sudden like who knows where
this run could go
you need to hit that shark as soon as
possible please the horse is probably a
little too late for the horse to really
generate that kind of efficacy for us
you're gonna call me crazy man this
looks okay
in fact it looks a lot better than okay
we easily are gonna win
no problem whatsoever
we still need another unit
i wouldn't mind a 1515 bus is probably
like a lower priority
you know what
deprioritize
give me some tier ones now we're talking
you're gonna buy me
you're gonna sell me
you're gonna buy me
you're gonna sell me
you're gonna
you're gonna freeze me just in case
you're gonna
freeze me
and for now you're gonna buy me
i don't see like you're really like a
last
ditch effort just in case things go a
little wrong here
fly instead it kind of screws up our our
deer with capacity
is this that's a spicy leopard man okay
you see a 50 hp unit you're just kind of
like at this point
[Laughter]
i expect to go down
if if our snake could maybe take out the
kangaroo
all right that's a loss but hey seven
wins regardless
as they had scaling you know the the
monkey scaling that bison did some great
work for him we didn't commit to units
fast enough to get some scaling i'm
actually really pleased with seven wins
honestly i think that's like uh
it's a pretty good performance
there what's your best win streak
uh i've had three 10 wins in a row one
time
i was losing it man because i went to
obama hello daniel hello i went to
malvestream and he was like hey we had
five uh wins in a row and i was like
that's actually incredible and then
somebody in chat was like
you know he considers it a win when he
has more wins than losses
so this guy like
he he gasled me into believing
that he was getting
ten wins and that's what a win is called
but instead he was going like five and
four and being like oh add one to the
streak like this
you gotta be careful with this guy man
this is uh we can roll double pig
the best unit in the early game is the
unit that uh you have the most of
i always especially like pygmy pygmy
pygmy just in the hopes that we can get
piggies is one of our names but that's
not the case unfortunately i think this
is a round one loss probably
would be the
moody fuss pots
you want you're a piece this is a
guaranteed loss mathematically good
mosquito
so easily forgotten
i mean we need a unit i you know what
whatever commit to the future man
freeze me
roll me
commit to the future
this is a horrible squad but
next turn it might be an incredible
squad i don't even want to see this [ __ ]
just speed me up
you got to do the duck strat
if you watch like any of the streams i
do the duck streak
many times
many times
so don't sweat that i'm
i it's not you it's me i invented it's
not you it's me
full duck strand well that comes down to
the shops man i don't i don't have
control over that
okay full bacon build
guess we should have got one more unit
first we got a five seven
we need to buy out here
buy me
buy me
buy me buy me
i like this dude sometimes actually you
want to have the spider one back because
sometimes it can summon a ram
yeah
the spider sucks okay 2-2
very bad
however
there's so many great tier threes you
get an ox you get a sheep you get a
turtle
you know these are this will do good
stuff for you and five seven hits like a
freaking brick so don't even sweat that
man
oh you almost got me just kidding see
look they got a freaking sheep man
it's bs
i got a freaking snail after all that i
got a freaking snail this is another
loss by the way
all right time to uh
time to start trying
it's no big deal you got a ram i got a
i got a snail with no upside it's no big
deal it's not a big deal or whatever
in many ways
technically you could pill a spider but
i'm not in the business of making
enemies right now dude okay you know
what
don't talk to me
you all ready for this
three squad marty
six eight red
giraffe
after everything we've been through
a giraffe
i'm getting beaten by my own fan mr big
huge large
all right probably go in on the doubters
on this one
be a rare winless run we'll run that one
back
embarrassing
they should at least give you five
points man
like that's that's all i ask
this is a squad this is a this is a very
acceptable squad we freeze you we buy
you we roll you
and honestly
like we're pretty happy with the way
this looks right here that's totally
fine
yeah yeah this is fine
yeah the shop i mean look desperate
housewives that's a classic i'm not
gonna say we did like super well there
um
i was don't don't shoot my cricket this
is literally like the only thing i was
worried about um but we did have some
busted shops this is still a loss
because we're gonna have a 3-2
cricket that spawns a 1-1 but it was
close
so we like this
we like that
we roll once
a fish absolutely
something like this this should be a
draw at worst
front load your big stuff i agree in
principle but i disagree when you have
an ants
i think that and i don't have the the
math to back this up this is a nasty
team man
um yeah we're going down
i feel like an ant
works best when you can guarantee that
it buffs your strongest unit
okay here we go this this is what it's
all about
next level ants
these they've served their purpose
combine me
swan me
i don't sweat the early game is just
what the early game is you know it would
be nice to not get those early losses
but it's that's life man
sell me my two three freeze me buy me a
flamingo
you know what run
let's try this out here let's run
something like that freeze the pill roll
one more time
i don't need another flamingo i'm
content with this
okay this is a win
we're lucky we're going up against chat
i think it's a lit turn three is a
little late to stay invested in your
your duck build you pretty much gotta
get out of that by turn two
by me
i'll probably use the pill but i just
wanna want to take a peek first that's
another roll
scampi build is so rarely like the right
play
um so i think what i would do if i were
me
is probably
something like this
and then buy a scampi even though i said
i wasn't gonna buy a scampi
scampi build has never worked for me uh
i agree wholeheartedly i could not agree
more however
i've said this a few times one of the
great things about scampi build one of
the truly underrated facets of it you
piece
just this close
is that it lets you
uh
buy and sell things
which is fun and fun you know that's
what it's all about
at least at the start now here okay this
is where you can build
something like this
starts to you're starting to think about
getting the job going here
you need to be able to not die
that's very helpful
we would like to
have a dodo making our peacock a little
stronger
you need this
we need this i know we could have gotten
another level but the the garlic is so
much more important to make sure we
don't die this turn
this doesn't look too bad but i do see a
dog at the back we really need our our
uh
we need our camel to make our peacock
pop off here that seems like this is no
risk
okay just get the now next thing we need
the dodo's gotta pop but we need some
permanent scaling
that was that was totally fine
start here
i think you owe it to yourself to try
getting the hippo off the ground
it probably is not going to do anything
for us right now
that's huge
we need like this is where the the
you know we we stepped on the clutch
accidentally and the car is about to
stall
if we can make it through this round
which looks
plausible
i wish our camel was a little stronger
i wish it was a baller
when i said plausible what i meant is
there's no chance whatsoever
yeah that's a strong dog and let me
guess turtle
no ox
let me get a let me get a no on that one
we'll pay out the doubters on a two win
and run the predictions right back
i like this because oh this is the dream
this is just your squad this is probably
like the meta squad you would want the
most
not seeing a duplicate unit here kind of
sucks but
that's okay
maybe the illegal ice cubes on that one
we farm up i'm not sure if we farm up a
little
extra doubt or a little extra belief
after all that um but either way i'm
happy to see it look at this this horse
gets us there when you get like a
clumped variance like this you create
some arbitrage opportunities that's all
i'm gonna say
this is another big buy
it's another good buy
this is another
we'd rather roll into a b
we're gonna get a one one might as well
apply it to a unit i suppose
this is a scary squad no doubt about
that that's the dream when you when an
aunt buffs and ants
we say pog this is still this is a loss
though
man that's a nasty squad
i wonder what the otter hit how did you
get that otter to pop off so
so thusly
this looks fine
freeze me roll me
roll
me
okay
um this is the thinking man's game this
has to get frozen
so that you can get the level up on the
fish to hit the dodo next turn
i think you have to
kill an ant
and then just roll this
insane squad
that's actually really good
we have no hp which is sub-optimal
but
anything that we go up against will also
die in one hit
this seems terrible okay
calva with the suspicious craters
kentucky derby build
every build you see online is a kentucky
derby build
this is good this is this is not bad
you definitely you know you got to
consider your bias here look something
like this
two five i think we can roll it like
this
for now
roll me once
i'm asking for like the slightest bit
of of shop help
just like a shop situation where you get
a unit you already have close to
leveling up would change our world right
now this looks this looks okay
this looks okay
now a tanky
camel
in front of a blowfish can do some
serious work lelling2
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
you sell this for now
and it's it's really only for now
we then place a blowfish it's a
five-five as we speak
i think we we're we want this fish man
like
we've invested so much
look a bee could do fine on somebody
i don't think you can roll i i don't
think you roll sheep here and i know
it's it's controversial
we can add one later but we're pivoting
off of the horse the horse is not going
to be long for this world like like the
robot in rocky 4 is going bye-bye you
get the fish it gives you a plus one
plus one then we start to think about
selling the fish selling the horse
getting a monkey
and and getting some good scaling
scaling is how you get the long-term
the long-term growth going here
so this is a you're going to think i've
lost it but it's a sell me
by me
pill me
and then even just a mere
temporary giraffe
giraffe
and then blowfish garlic armor
buff the dodo permanently
just needed a little bit more attack
please
you know what this looks okay the the ox
probably kills our blowfish
i'm glad we're slowing it down a little
bit
it's a good smack
that
armor man okay that's gonna be a loss
but it's a loss where i'm happy with
where our team is standing
i have belief
in our future i for the first time in a
while
please
just just one fish
for the first time in a while i believe
that we can rattle off four wins you're
actually like you're joking with me i
think you need you need some more
survivability even though this looks
better on the dodo
like i mean we're on round six
would have thought like just in theory
it would have been hypothetically
possible for us to have gotten a uh
a third fish by now but but what do i
know you know
big plays
you peace
it's a doubters paradise again man look
look at this three doubter wins in a row
start me over let's try not to lose some
badly in the early game this is like a
classic start
i think you freeze horse roll fish
and let me go with
folded hats
why not
this is uh
this looks good
[Laughter]
that it that's a squad that's built for
the future okay
lucky us
definitely you buy horse first
start getting some combo pieces rolling
in here
um
gotta be honest a b would hit the spot
right now
this this will not be less than a draw
this is a great team
like double horse and the slightest bit
of tankiness is like is free money
there's two wins
okay dodo is of the utmost importance
you could you could try to start
squeezing the dog build in here looks
something like this
this
hold on
this
so you get the nice double buff here
combine
move you to the back
you're gonna
dodo is so good it allows us to pivot
off of this if this is not working
you're going to buy me you're going to
get a nice buff we're going to look for
a unit we already have
of course that's not possible as we've
established many times so
i'm going to purchase
a
piece of meat
knowing that we're going to be rolling
the
horse for at least a temporary moment
just take a little meat on you we'll be
looking to replace that on good units
with garlic to begin with
at some point but for now
interesting 3 6 camel
six four and
dude the meat is gonna line up perfectly
like look at this
all you
peace
it did line up perfectly
why not dog well because like i want the
dog to have garlic soon the horse is
like
if they end up rolling meat until i
eventually sell them
there's no skin off my you know what
give me give me some bold plays here
i i respect the swan
nothing wrong with getting a 4-4 swan
out there for a turn
i respect a double swan and you know
what a a permanent dodo buff
i'm just like
it shouldn't be
so difficult
this ox is going to be a real pain and a
dick huh um it shouldn't be so difficult
to
find a unit that we already have
like i'm just i'm i'm just begging for
like one of these things that is already
almost there
like this is great
i want an ox of my own i'm sorry dog we
tried
i think you got a roll
either ox or kangaroo we we kangaroo
maybe has some more permanence
associated with it
we'll get at least two triggers here
unless we roll into something that has a
splash attached if something has a
splash attached you just like say
um like you know some things are not
meant to be you need the level here so
that we can actually get something
i think though
brazen though it is
sell me a swan
to buy me a deer these are in an
acceptable order freeze me this
okay
early chili is gonna do some serious
damage
the elephant's a little nasty
i would not dispute that but i think oh
there you go
now that's a bus
kangaroo's popping
we love it
we love it
we have no love for this
if if our deer could trade
i would have some respect for it
it's not gonna at least it's hidden
new peace
this this dang kangaroo i was gonna
trade with the bee though our kangaroo
is gonna be strong as hell get owned
okay okay we got something going on here
two wins in a row for the first time in
an hour
a penguin would be
amazing if
in place of our horse if we could just
get one of these [ __ ] units
at some point like i do want to dump
this fish but also it being a level two
would be nice for us for scaling why
can't you where are you
where are you
they don't exist
and this we're looking at like a deep
role here
okay well you gotta can me like we gotta
find a way out of this mess okay
you can sell a fish
roll a hippo at the front move the dodo
over to make your hippo more likely to
get a kill otherwise we're simply going
to find ourselves in a death spiral
please do me a favor and keep
this penguin
available just in case we managed to get
these units to level two
hello sim victor hello
happy to see you happy you're enjoying
some super auto pets
in your in your recording life
get get smacked try to get close and
your fish will get smacked
my homie snoop dogg and dr dre have got
my back
that's why you buy meat man that's why
you buy meat
now
you need hp but we can add garlic i
think you got it you gotta do something
like this
okay well you know you had your chance
eat it
get buffed
please just like a level two dodo dude
holy crap if you just give me a level 2
dodo
i don't even know what to say i would i
would be over the moon man
might as well try me
i am i'm physically incapable
of getting a level two unit it just
can't be done
okay our hippo's gonna die early which
means this is a loss i mean you're
running up against
turkey
rooster you know
is it's not a it's not a good situation
to be in
we came fairly close honestly on all
that but
i'm just begging you for
okay you know what hold on there's
something
bad your magic
thank you for the
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
snail is nice but like what do you sell
to make it work
i don't think you smell
yo you're gonna hate this you sell the
monkey
don't can me yet we're not gonna roll a
snail you sell the monkey because this
is basically for three gold
we get 4x the monkey effect and it was
only a level one with no experience we
we have more coming at some point
um
and then like
just just [ __ ] do it man just do it
okay
you're gonna you're gonna sell that
kangaroo
you're gonna buy a horse to buff
everything
incredible um
you're gonna roll me once you're gonna
freeze your tier one units and we're
gonna try to dragging ourselves out of
this hell hole
that's it
there's the fish by the way
at least we're trading that's all you
can say about that at least we're
trading
we did better than trade actually
that was the easiest win like you had me
you had me sweating for no reason that's
win number five
then it's a sell me we will can at some
point it doesn't have to happen yet
because like we're not going to be
rolling these units long term let's say
sell me
this i'll buy me
that's a sell me
this i'll buy me
that's a sell me these are nice buffs
it's a freeze me as a just in case
um
you might find this humorous
i assure you i do as well
but i feel like there's something to be
said about just having two deers
you can unfreeze that now
it's very weird but it could get us out
of a jam
owns
you're a piece
whatever we got you
wait you're still alive
owned
this looks good this looks this looks
this looks like a a win barely but a win
okay that's that means believers get
paid
and we're starting to we're starting to
start to get ourselves out of something
you might as well just add me i guess
buy me
sell me
add me we really even more than a can i
know like we've been holding that for so
long
even more than a can we need
uh garlic or melon on the hippo i think
for now even though this doesn't fit the
dragon build
i don't know
i thought about it obviously um
you need the dodo up here hold on i
you know what
big booty sauron this one's for you
hold on this freeze the whole damn shop
this one's for you okay
i'm i knew i was rolling four but i
thought the garlic was worth more than a
[ __ ] unit
you you mothered
you peace
whatever we still get you you get me you
give me him him me i see a very similar
squad here i can't help but notice we
had very similar ideas
oops i won
vb long neck with a four squad easy win
i froze the whole damn shop okay
still on this level one dodo by the way
now
you dump the deer
you're gonna laugh man you're gonna
freaking laugh okay
you dump the
you know what no no you dump the dodo
the dodo is ready to go to go go
you dump the dodo you roll the tiger
behind the dragon
and then you just buy me sell me now
does you know what [ __ ] it we're gonna
test it
please tell me this works okay we're
looking for 2-2 we want to see our hippo
go to 1921.
okay
good to know um
this only works at end of turn okay well
that's fine we'll still we like this
losing the dodo sucks but still
this is okay because we can do this okay
yeah yeah
roll me
oh that's uh
everything here is important
you can laugh all you want
[ __ ] the cow
you can laugh all you want this is the
dream this is the squad
it did not work at all
that was not the squad
i'm not sure what i was thinking
i regret everything immensely
we got a little we got high on our own
supply but hey
seven wins
and we pay out the believers it's nice
to end on a happy note like that for for
uh
the first part of this video
as we start up another one here and we



say will and l get the six wins or more
but now we go
uh now we go
pay to win
also known as uh bat gameplay
still good
still good still good enough
you're a piece of crap
you know what
the best tier one unit
smooth streamers
best uh best tier one unit is the unit
you get the most of
eat it
great stuff good work mosquitoes good
work i think you gotta roll two pigs
beautiful
you you need to add a little sauce
to the gumbo you know put a b on a unit
throw some bees on it
just got an ant
throw some throw some bees on it
you know what i'm talking about no yes
this is bad uh i like that we hit the
same unit but a lot of a lot of tanky
ass units here uh and a tanky ass beetle
at the back means this is a loss but it
happens
you know what we got our own bat here
uh be me
i mean pygmy
you need a bad it's non-negotiable
freeze me
roll me
i'm not i don't know if i've ever used
the tabby cat man
i don't know if it's ever been done
i'll level with you though i think we're
dumping this pig
freezing a spider and and trying to get
a better unit earlier
i mean you know what it is a 4-3 but i
think i'd still rather have a spider
even though a spider is not amazing
the the units that can spit out can
sometimes be do it i get so pissed off
when i'm playing somebody with a damn
spider
it's an 11 6 fish huh good never mind
well played
well played i get so pissed when i'm
playing somebody that has a
a
shitty spider hasn't even been leveled
up at all
and then uh it spits out a ram so
basically your your 2 2 spits out a 2 2
that spits out two tutus just like eat
me this
pisses me off man
it sucks oh yeah or it's it's a spider
in front of a kangaroo right so the
spider attacks the kangaroo gets a buff
the spider dies and spits out a turtle
the turtle attack the kangaroo gets a
buff then it spits out melon armor on
the kangaroo and it's like all of a
sudden it's round three it's a 18-2
kangaroo that's just going freaking wild
on you with invincibility
we don't need to swan on this build we i
i like a swan in general but
i i also like the idea that this son of
a gun could in theory level up at some
point
i know that's naive of me to assume that
we would run the risk of at some point
having another mosquito show up i guess
i'll uh [ __ ] off
buy a swan
you know what inner meet me
on the inside
i'll take a bat meat
it's called guano sweetheart is it
called guan i don't know if that's true
oh tough luck
excuse me
so you all you guys don't listen to the
beta band
early caterpillar hey you'd rather play
an early caterpillar than a late
butterfly let me tell you you peace
we'll accept that we'll accept that
okay this big we're getting a level up
for the first time in my career
it gave us a bison which is not the best
but it's you know if we get a spider
here we'll be happy we froze it we
didn't life goes on instead do me the
service of freezing me a bat and
purchasing me some garlic armor roll me
one time
get ready to pill this ant for the low
low cost of net zero because we'll sell
the b back to the shop and then
this is this is fine we're scaling at an
appropriate level right now
what makes a bath so good honestly like
the weakness effect is great
the fact that it uh
please break the melon armor let's go
the fact that it uh
makes enemies take way more damage is
great but the real reason that it's
great even into the late game is just
because it overrides whatever their
piece of equipment is and equipment
like melon armor in particular is a must
on at least one or two units if you want
to get to 10 wins so the the bat is just
incredible
you spend six on the ants so it's not
net zero
yeah um but it also gave us some wins so
you i don't know what it's like you eat
a meal you poop it out
you're like oh that's money wasted i
don't know there's a difference it could
be money wasted in some ways if you
didn't use that energy to do something
except talk [ __ ] in twitch chat but i
use that to do many to lift
break logs for firewood um
hunts for
wild elk
on my acreage and as a then turn that
into sausage for the winter
uh so i
you know it's really more of a matter of
what you do with
you know your life than
whether or not you fiscally turn the
purchase into an investment
um
but for the time being dude i'm loving
this blowfish
you know what here's what's gonna happen
blowfish
i don't care however i do love him this
spider's gonna die this spider is gonna
spit out a turtle this turtle is gonna
buff our awesome spider and then this
spider's gonna go ape [ __ ]
oh
i've got i've got too much frozen we oh
snail
this dude's rolling a snail man are you
kidding me
oh turtle turtle you
all right this is not good
this is real this is horrible all right
fair enough good snail up at the front
um
well well played well played
i know we got the whole the whole damn
squads frozen
you know what i believe you're gonna get
there
i believe you're gonna get there i do
i do
we need one spider or a chocolate it's
gonna happen at some point you mother oh
it's oh
eat it
nice five five hatching chick you
scumbag
we win these four wins
you could sell a swan to get a puppy
scaling but it's just a little too late
that's what we like please
please give me a spider somehow i don't
know how that would even work no no no
we can't afford to sell the stuff to
make this happen
um
i mean this does great for us right now
hello
look at this amazingly happy baby
gag
oh
no
and then one of the girl
we named her jennifer on my stream yeah
she plugged her ears oh
you made jennifer plug her ears
and it was uh
oh she's embarrassed she's like i i
almost cried oh no i was like oh my god
am i doing a bad thing
my i got i got upset
my baby could not stop crying
oh
got a great grip on you there honey
hey honey where's your head
too easy
where your eyeball
that's tough
daddy i don't want to poke my eyeball
where's your eye
there yay
hooray
hooray
hooray
hooray
[Laughter]
hi
hi hi chad
bye
bye chad
peek-a-boo
oh she's she sees the cat she's gone
that's the cat oh
great job
oh man
now that that is good stuff
always with the seals man
okay love you
how we doing here i i've lost track of
myself but you know what
doesn't bother me in the slightest
because are you seeing this right here
are you seeing this
i do hate to see oh you got the turtle
to override the bat
you met a lord you met a lord
the seal is highly slept on in my
experience when people say a seal or any
unit in this game is slept on
what they really mean is that it's not
very good but one time you picked it up
and got to seven wins
that whenever i see that people are like
people are sleeping on tabby cat and i'm
like okay so what if i put it in the f
tier
what would you put it in and they're
like low d
like yeah it's really slept on
you could roll a pseudo
a pseudo food build
77412 is a net pretty similar change
here thanks for the gold
roll me
honestly i think you freeze this and buy
this you save that chocolate
get your blowfish pogging a little bit
i'm happy i'm very happy with this
bison
bro do we already have one he's in the
middle right here
let's go they hit the dog man turtle
turtle me caterpillar you peace you
peace you're not an intellectual
it's all right we still win these
that's six wins right we're on believer
status real believer status
i mean how could you not right
we don't need to keep a spider around
anymore
i think look i'm not saying the octopus
wouldn't get us there
i just don't think it would
i i still i stand by the
belief that we had that one beautiful
octopus build and it has never done
anything every time i've the first time
i had an octopus we didn't even have any
attacks
we just won just based on the effect
however
since then every time i've seen an
octopus it's just been it's just been
killed
honestly straight up man let me tell i
was like chilly she's like
here's what you do you freeze a bat
buy a cupcake put it on your blowfish
get a gold in return you mother whatever
we missed the roll as a result big
freaking what
please
we weaken that dog thank you
thank you
you peace
give it to the doubters man give it to
the doubters
honestly like i know this has happened a
few times
that's a win in mouth stream that's not
a win on my stream
if you're used to mouth standard
we we do things a little bit differently
around here 5'4 we consider that a cause
for derision um
we
the meta has gone through yet another
phase of improvement you know we we had
like
in the first couple of days nobody knew
what they were doing it was fun the
second
phase was like people started to think
about synergies and we got outscaled and
then eventually we brought it back now
we had like a week where we were eating
good we were get nine eight ten six
three four ten nine um
consistently now like turn five you're
also running into people that are like
by the way i have an 18 18 fish people
are really
like
fine-tuning their decision-making
process in this game so it's
this will make us better long-term to be
suffering the ill effects of it right
now
this squad kinda sucks
roll me once
this is okay
especially because we can guarantee the
health buffs
you always got a beetle at the back
little beaver sandwich
goes really well with the um
wet fingers
also
oh no no no they're me but slightly
stronger
we we trade here that's fine um
yeah also people are saying there's no
penalty for leaving bad arenas so people
like load up the game and then
when they don't see like a shop that
they like earlier they just abandon that
[ __ ]
i don't respect that
you should always stream like you should
always game like somebody's watching
that's what they tell you
[Applause]
dude it's like a b is okay but i i value
three rerolls for a fully optimized shop
well that's about as good as it's gonna
get
because we're not going to freeze
anything else um
more than that be
at least without a horse or something
this is bad two ants is pretty spicy
that's the beautiful ant buff the the
that first ant was largely neutralized
we win this actually
lucky me
this is very nice so we start
we start here
no we start
it's fine it's not a big deal we start
here
tropical fish i i do not mind holding it
early we want to make sure it's buffing
the two units most likely to stick
around
that's good anything but the beaver was
acceptable there
very happy with this squad right now
it's another it's a pseudo-scary team
but i think we're in a
we're in an okay spot
you love that
we win okay
just very slightly ahead of the power
curve which is fine
so i think we do like another fish
i think we make an executive decision
here to sell the beaver with the maximum
chance to hit the units we want to hit
didn't hit the fish
life goes on
swan is fine basically you get a refund
on it next turn
is fine honestly like
you just take it freeze the pill roll
once
and probably say that's good enough
it did hit a fish you're not wrong this
is a scary squad
that's just about as badly as that could
have possibly gone
still get an okay trade melon armor is
terrible this is a loss
no this is a win never mind
[Laughter]
oh
man
okay
you have an obligation to roll early
caterpillar you kill the ants
i really wanted to sell that swan but
you got it if you see a caterpillar
round five
i'm not i'm not messing with that um
try me
it's just the one thing i didn't want
you to hit
then you got to keep this fish scaling
now we need like some form of of
hopefully like permanent scaling
we do okay against sheep
we do we do well against peacock
we do just fine against mosquito so our
swan beats their squad their swan
we're up to four wins already
oh dude you can totally run a level one
check
absolutely
so this is the gimme first
you have to sell yours
you can sell your beetle
but you need some space here
this can really start to pop
um
i think you can say that that beetle has
served this purpose
it would help us get some wins now don't
get me wrong but i think you got to go
or you could sell your fish at some
point because you're probably going to
go
get out of here get out of my face
we're keeping this like pretty much just
for the level up right now
i would rather have a four nine that has
upside on leveling
but then we got to figure out how we're
going to buy more units
there's an easy way
but if you we need to sell this to have
space to cycle to buy like the sellable
units in the future so freeze you for
now i know this looks a little goofy
this round i'm not
completely sold on
but i mean we do have a 13
16 fish
it's pretty sweet
like
it did a lot of work there
and it hasn't even really gotten started
so this is this is pretty good the fish
didn't even have garlic so this is the
whole reason we kept you around honestly
so that you could level up and then give
give us something we don't care about at
all and then you can buy me
and then you can sell me
and then you can buy me
and then you can sell me
everyone shut up okay
buy me
you're gonna we're gonna get a nice
combined scaling on
because next turn we're going to combine
the fish he's going to get plus 2 and
plus 2 to everything uh
and this thing's going to be
don't worry about it that's what i would
say right now is don't worry about it
too much
i would not mind going worm on this
build
right now it's looking just fine early
melon armor just pisses me off man
whatever that fish sucked anyway
don't care didn't ask plus you suck this
is a nasty squad you know
i we we
maybe we draw this
we draw this
but with scaling we like it a lot
okay but this might be a poodleable
build man
you start here obviously
and then you don't get the extra space
so that was pretty smart um i think you
definitely go no you didn't
um okay so we want our bison to scale
the poodle gives us some nice scaling
three four three one if you uh
how are you gonna do that because we
don't want the caterpillar to well you
know what you put the caterpillar up at
the front then it doesn't soak up the
buff
that the poodle would give it
and the poodle is good
but we also want to keep a space open
for buying selling for the bison so the
bison can scale so i think you buy first
and we accept this as the cost of doing
business
we place this on you
roll
though this doesn't appear fantastic yet
i promise you investing in a can is okay
right now
there's there's some good plays on can
microbe plus turtle equals uh you know
this this person they got an idea what
they're doing don't get me wrong
turns out you know
they got us
that's you can't be mad about lose
that's just a fun build to run into
uh oh this is like i mean you definitely
go like this
now a sauropod makes food better
you could dump the hatching chick
the the caterpillar is very close to
pulling from the buffalo instead of the
fish in fact it might even be there now
um
and a sword you know what a sauropod
works well for a round no matter what
and then we can buy food in the future
or we could sell you and buy things that
give us a benefit when we buy you
i i know that we see a squirrel synergy
uh here i'm not sold on that um
it's a must get scaling is always
valuable
you don't need to freeze a salad
no when you get your scaling going you
you don't dump uh
your units that have like bad text
associated with them you keep them going
because as bad as text is uh it's
still very nice to hit somebody for 30.
poodles buffing itself instead of uh
buffalo
that is true you know what that is that
is true information thank you
we'll unfreeze this
now you know what you sold me after all
that you did you kind of sold me because
check this out
if we sell a fish
we might backslide for a little bit here
but it seems to work well with the seal
um where we can then
i guess we wouldn't well you know we
should feed you well i don't know i
don't know if we're going to keep you
yet let's start there
i'm going to level with you i think a
scaling rhino
works better
you peace it's fine quick little food
build
sure
that's always good but
we're pot committed right now
rhino is never good
tell me you roll exclusively white
weenie builds without telling me you
roll exclusively white weenie builds
okay get smacked get smacked get smacked
we trade that worm scares the crap out
of me man that worm
the worm is not but it's not scary
enough
there we go that's seven wins
you need a little garlic for sure
garnier fructose for you
i think we buy some food for a sweet
little refund
i think we buy some food
roll me
oh
we now get ready to dump either poodle
or sauropod
and now we're okay let me think about
this give us plus two plus two yeah we
next turn we sell the poodle
and then just go
just go freaking hard man
yes
yes okay if we lose this one nobody
cares
um that's not great
that's an understatement
[Laughter]
it's a heck of a bad hey this oh you
killed my poodle you piece
hold on we draw these
forget the octopus it's a trap
roll me
honestly you might as well take a steak
now roll me
we could do with the freeze
and then roll me and we have to stay
we're not going to upgrade our sauropod
it's probably the next to go
we have to keep the excess gold in order
to justify the buffs here in the first
place
that chocolate is gonna get used at some
point we haven't we haven't found the
right opportunity
to hither to this point
at least the dog goes this is a nasty
squad man
that being said we draw we draw these
i'm going
we have to
let it roll let it roll one more time
because we got to stay on three i think
the t-rex is much more valuable to scale
than the rhino
why are you committing on rhino get
ready to be ashamed of your words and
your deeds by the way
there's the shame is coming
like sam cook said
a shame is gonna come
we might kill you nice melon armor too
bad uh you're dead
and too bad we won easily okay that
takes us to eight you had one buy left
who who wants to do the who wants to do
the honors in chat
tyrannosaurus rex
it's a tier six unit with an effect at
the end of your turn if you have three
or more gold give your other friends
plus two plus two
so you know what keep your lulls in a
sack and sit on it
just like he sat on the chocolate there
the sauropod
doesn't have to exist anymore
however he's scaling like a son of a gun
and i love it
i i take nothing here
well you know
we'll roll it
roll once
i would prefer
i i need melon man melon is like that's
how we win the game if we get them if we
get two melon one for you and one for
the bison or the buffalo then we're then
we're set
garlic is like is is too late in the
game for it to be super useful this is
just a nasty squad man are you that look
at the poodle plus the t-rex holy crap
geez louise
why did you freeze pair well because
pair is also a nice little
2-2 here 2-2 here and gives us a refund
so i thought it was a reasonable uh use
case
you know what no we still want you up at
the front but um you are just better so
go ahead and take that for the time
being
with four four we could probably just
roll once here
okay okay
i'll freeze a little sushi anyway i know
it seems a little backwards but
then the only thing that really we're
looking for on this build is either
things to scale our t-rex just in case
and number one is melon on our uh on our
rhino our rhino also it doesn't just
counter white weenie it also does a
great job of taking out melon armor
which is like
it's pretty sweet honestly
that sucks unfortunately
hold on all is not lost yet
easiest win of my life
that takes us to uh nine wins
i think we look for our next level rhino
melon is is a must buy
we can buy chocolate and with the refund
we'll still get
to three gold
absolutely beautiful
that's you couldn't really ask for like
a a better series of events than that
now it's it's all up to our enemy builds
we got two chances to run into some
enemy builds that are not that good this
one is a [ __ ] nightmare the scorpion
at least dies without killing us
i thought melon protected you from
maybe it was just stats were its stats
just strong enough to to get me
i thought because melon protects you
from uh poison doesn't it it didn't okay
it did enough damage fair enough
certainly don't need you
um
look melon on sauropod is going to be
helpful
i mean we we can do one more
buy the best food
and place it on
on you i suppose and then we'll still be
a three for scaling
i still think this team could win
we just want to see the
a not nightmarish team
this looks possible
it's a scary team but we're a scary team
too
we're gonna break
oh hey
they're gonna get us by one rooster
all right you got me
but still
nine wins that's the best run of the day
so far
we take those
believers get paid out
good scaling to get us out of a jam
there
and then will annel get six wins or more
we're still we're running it back
acceptable acceptable
kind of hate this squad uh
will be the illegal ice cubes
this is this is i in hearthstone
battlegrounds context i would say 40
chance of victory
beautiful shot
our odds of victory have just risen
to zero
but her odds of drawing are very good
we have to buy a mosquito
the stats on a beetle are very good
none of these weren't purchasing
so instead we just put honey on our
beetle which gives everybody else
in the shop plus one plus one
i thought it was uh
i thought it was everybody on the squad
gets uh gets plus one hp
ah nice try
you like you like to see that we do like
to see that
i think this is a win man i don't even
think we touch our ladybug this is a
nice clean win
we gotta try to
get up here a little bit so we we do one
of these we roll once
you're a real piece of crap you know
that imo this is heavy rolls
that's a huge play i'm thrilled
sell me a fish buy me a bed
pass me a bottle mr jones that that's
that's a huge build
i would love to do a hyper buy sell
build
it just it has to be at the right time i
don't shy away from the buy sell i've
been known to buy and or sell
we're so lucky with the way that worked
out but uh it's it's got to be it's got
to be right and i'm not sure it's right
yet
god i just want to level up man like i
know this is maybe not
what the [ __ ]
this is a dream come true
[Laughter]
i mean you freeze freeze for sure
then you freeze like our next round like
this this fight right here might suck
kind of badly
but this is a great setup for the future
especially dude now we get like bats and
deer for like some chili peppers oh this
is a loss like double flamingo into an
810 blowfish like
that's just a damn nightmare
just just accept this one there's no
fast forward button fast enough to get
me through this
that's that's a nice spike you got to
respect the squad like that
and this is the one time i'm gonna be
happy to like freeze an entire shop oh
my god that's so good
okay so now you buy a poodle early and
you just make sure your squad has
different tiers of animals and you do
super well as a result um you don't you
can buy a deer early and it'll work
really well with the bat uh and then
you'll you just position the deer so it
doesn't get buffed and the poodle gets
buffed instead
so we will for now this might be like we
want to do this like piecemeal but i
think you could sell
a mosquito
you buy a poodle place it at the back
buff
no buff
no buff so the swan will go at some
point okay
um
buff buff this is we're gonna keep this
beetle like we it's nice to have a tier
one unit that has a lot of time to scale
um the swan will go at some point for
now you're tier four so we i a deer is
just gonna work so well with our level
two bat i feel like it's
basically non-negotiable so you might as
well sell your cricket
you guys want some crickets
get a deer out there which is going to
absolutely destroy with your level 2 bat
basically the caterpillar inherits the
scaling from something so you probably
sell swan and buy caterpillar it's gonna
be uh
and it's gonna soak up some buffs in the
meantime as well from the poodle which
is nice um this this will be interesting
we need to live for a little bit but i
think we've got a great squad for
temporary living
yeah
i mean this is uh the the most
undeserved win of all time but
look this is like a super shoot you know
what
for
three gold we get a level up and we can
sell something for two gold so for one
gold oh but it's not because we're on an
even numbered turn it's not gonna uh
move us up a level
so
sell beetle keep swann no because the
beetle is a tier one so i guess scaling
for the poodle the swan is a level two
so it does not get scaling because our
bat takes it we want the bat to take it
long term you know because it's going to
stick around longer so we want a
caterpillar
and it has to take the swans place
so
the best time to do that is as soon as
possible um we caterpillar's not gonna
be too bad they're gonna soak up some of
the buffs themselves
hook me up juice me squeeze me you
already knew that was coming the deer
will not be a long-term choice
the caterpillar doesn't need buffs but
it doesn't matter because it's not
taking buffs from anything else
and also it's nice that it gets buffs so
it's like a little bit more survivable
instead of just being a 1-4 on its way
to leveling it has it has the ability to
contribute to the squad and it's also
going to
get buffed because no matter what gets
buffed it takes its buffs so we want to
basically i almost feel like we're in
heavy role to get the poodle going hard
here
hatching chick is a level three
doesn't really fit what we're doing but
i thought about it turtle is very nice
it's also a tier three
you could sell that honestly
it's a tough one for me because the deer
is doing great stuff
the reason i don't want to give it meat
is because we're like
gonna sell it at some point but
it's not a terrible decision i almost
feel like
i feel like you like a turtle but the
splash damage is so good you know what
i'm willing to accept this we can get a
turtle later if we want one um
garlic on bat could do us some work now
still in a delicate period
interesting
what an interesting situation we have
here
we're insanely lucky that
none of our great units got hit by uh
the weakness but you know what that's
that's just bad gameplay man
this is exactly what we're looking for
beetle is oof just you wait like here's
the thing we on the way up maybe we'll
buy some cans and then we can replace
our beetle with a different unit but
you're not going to be saying the
beetles oof when it's hidden for 40.
okay i promise you prepare yourself
now
what's our best unit for now is you so
let's just invest in you
keep it coming here
absolutely beautiful weakness yet again
i don't know what to say like we're just
insanely lucky
[Laughter]
okay
i'm not that attached to the beetle
that's a sellable bible
buffable buffable
poodle me you peace
poodle me
don't respect it
i don't respect it
i respect it
can me
buff me
roll me for one turn
i would as long as we're winning
i don't care who you are what you did
where you're from as long as we're
buffing okay this rhino
we would love to see some weakness there
but life life comes at you fast
as long as we trade with the rhino i'm
sweating it but i'm not sweating it that
much we don't quite do enough but that's
our first loss there that's okay dog
weakness was good but not quite good
enough
beautiful um chocolate is a gimme
certainly seems like you play dragon
here
and you probably i feel like you
probably use the deer as your
as your flex position so you can scale
your buffs as fast as possible but we
need to see some tier ones
in order to justify it holy crap
[Laughter]
oh my god so we can make the caterpillar
into a butterfly next turn
this is this is some spooky stuff man
this this is an incredible shop there
was a poodle in there
so what
what poodle's supposed to be good now
owns okay i don't i see some scary units
but they're not that scary
they're not that scary
there's the believer win
that's why people doubt i get it
good good message from a first time
chatter welcome to chat you're you're
fulfilling the chat prophecy of uh
comedic timing
as believers get paid out so on now i
understand why people doubt
very sensible
valedictorian
i was gonna say valedictorian at clown
college maybe that's a little too far i
i apologize okay
so you can roll
we don't need the poodles man we scale
faster
like okay a poodle getting to level
three is okay all right but a t-rex
does what a level two poodle does as a
level one
it wasn't that that time there's a
caterpillar i don't want a caterpillar i
got chocolate man it's the perfect fit
you wasted chocolate you'll see how
wasted the chocolate is when we're
popping champagne bottles at 10 wins
now
i mean this is just a it's a
there's spice here okay but it's a sell
me
by me
there's
the problem is a t-rex is a is a very
easy plus two plus two we like that
nobody doesn't like that
however
it doesn't buff itself
i think you want to
leave a space open
to trade
tier ones
that way you can give plus one plus ones
easily to everybody i don't think you
take t-rex here i know it's well
you have to think about okay so the
t-rex is buffing
bat dragon poodle caterpillar
which is exactly what's being buffed
by buying a tier one only when we buy a
tier one we can also get the upside from
purchasing it
and we can get the upside
you know okay here's the thing
i think it it works great
on this turn no doubt because for three
gold
we get a plus two plus two on everybody
which is amazing
but we may sell it in the future
in order to have a tier one spot where
we can buy sell buy sell buy sell
this looks okay
would it like to have hit that ladybug
you got a 39-25 ladybug burning a hole
in your pocket back there
we don't sweat that that's the easiest
win in my life
dragon force is a four squad
uh well yes and no hey like as we get
cans and stuff like that i don't mind
throwing out like you know a 10 10
uh fish that also gives a buff to
everything else like this is a pretty
good get
10 10 13 18 like who cares
run round 11 with seven wins
for now let's not sweat the uh
the t-rex let's leave him there and what
do did we unlock tier sixes
because if we unlock tier sixes i want
to try to get some
well i guess we'll keep him around if
we're gonna do that but i want to try to
get some
melon armors
melon armor on our strongest units maybe
maybe a turtle
instead of uh instead of a dragon at
some point
this is looking fine though
we don't sweat that
time's getting close though like we're
we're almost at the end of the game
okay
um
so we want to we could sell a dragon
in order to basically just think of it
this way to get two caterpillars
so you sell a dragon
or
no we want two melons this is good you
sell the dragon
you buy the turtle
we could pill them later but for now
we apply the melon armor to the bad
because garlic is irrelevant
you can we can get two rolls
don't really care for a can here pizza
pizza's okay
we could do double pizza next turn
i'd rather have a chance to get
chocolate i think this this is fine this
is fine now we want the turtle ideally
i was going to say we want the turtle
behind the caterpillar so it gets the
buff but it's irrelevant because um
we can't put the turtle behind the
caterpillar and then also have the melon
armor pass forward so
let's just accept the fact that turtle's
not gonna get our buff here and that's
okay
or the caterpillar yeah the turtle's not
gonna get our buff that's what i meant
to say okay
love that don't replace my melon armor
you peace whatever you're a piece but
piece this
we like it this is this is a little
spicy this one's looking a little spicy
in fact we're just going to die
but we ran into a tight squad there
this is a play
eight wins
roll me
pizza me
send me confirm me at some point we're
gonna want to get rid of this turtle or
level it up to level two
weak in the front you're a piece
sorry i didn't get weakened myself
nice trades
very nice this is a win
two goats
sorry to tell you i'm you but stronger
one up is pretty irrelevant
unfortunately
i think we gotta try
i would rather get level two armor than
plus
four plus four on everybody if we can
get another turtle
so i'm gonna roll down a little
i
understand to be honest this is not
going to be a popular decision
there's a chance though
dude it's a similar squad but i like
mine more
[Laughter]
i think this is this is a 10 spot it's a
pretty easy 10 spot at that
all right
dude no problem
choose outcome will nl get six wins or
more this is one of the easiest yeses of
my life
we'll throw in a slash marker sap two



we're gonna play one more hour
we're gonna play despots game we're
gonna play inscription that's the stream
today
it's just that dude time flies i love
that's why we doubt it's such a good
comment
oh why are you laughing this is your job
okay put now that we got a 10 win there
put me back on free to play
free to play me okay play me spam me
your piece
sticky geysers
no no sticky bagpipes is pretty good
[Laughter]
this is not the dream squad you know
what we're going up against like it's
the same squad
this is like thank you jarla for uh
for being the honorable gamer and and
playing the same way we played
you gotta respect that
many various different options here i
think you play this freeze this and
attach a b to one of these units throw
some b's on it just got a two one and i
don't know any of the lyrics throw some
bees on it
a little spicy
a little spicy
two fish is not what you want to see
when you're not running any horses
this looks like a pretty heavy loss and
by heavy i mean by one
that's fine you two you fish you're
expecting we were fully committed to
this round right here
camel early camel
every time i get a camel i want to put
on my board voice and say
kamela
but i'm worried that it's going to be
seen as a
personal attack on the current sitting
u.s vice president so instead i just i i
restrict myself to doing it in mouse
chat and i make sure that i always type
borad voice before it so people know
what i'm talking about
you can stay for now
yeah okay
just please don't don't show me any meat
at the front
no meat at the front please
this is this is fine
this is fine that's a great mosquito by
the way
yeah there needs to be like a
a tone indicator for borad voice man
that's what the internet needs
like a slash
kzed or something like that so you know
you're putting on like uh
a british kazakhstan accent
or bv slash bv my wife slash bv that's
perfect
very nice slash bv
it would totally
oh
that's good that's funny we like to
laugh here that's it it's merely about
the laughter you're a piece quite
frankly i'm gonna rework my whole run
sell me can i do this yeah sell me sell
me
sell me so we get the guaranteed buff on
the units that are actually good buy me
because you're decent
roll me and then give me some stuff
that's not pure garbage i really
appreciate it we're on turn four
this is just funny like
this is
this is just humorous
and then we'll we'll actually get some
levels up next turn that we can use to
vault maybe a couple of levels ahead i
hope
big whoop
please the the camel the camel the camel
whatever you suck
our fish is still gonna be a freaking
monster
no good blood sucker
i don't mind i don't mind the way this
looks
i think it's it's a draw but we were
stronger
you have to use your brain here okay we
want to keep a kangaroo so we want our
fish to buff our kangaroo when it levels
up that was a win oh never mind um so we
sell the ant even though there's no
upside the upside is that by selling the
ants
we get plus one plus one on our kangaroo
which is very nice
borat voice
and the kangaroo does very well here
then
there's something to be said about
getting the rooster popping on turn five
like that's just highly rude knowing
we're not going to be able to level it
up for a bit i still think eventually
maybe it works well behind the camel um
but for now we're just going to shove it
back there and be content
i'm going to be honest with you we're
pretty much looking for another fish
right now
if we don't get one we don't get one
um we can roll a beautiful combination
and i'm going to freeze a dodo long term
it does great stuff
uh
yeah this actually works insanely well
well there's there's multiple ways you
could play this one
the best chance for us i i actually
think that is you know what i'm here to
prove that a four squad marty can get
the job done
i think people are they okay well that
we ran into a fish that's like exactly
horrible for us but um i think people's
commitment to the oh this is a don't
look okay
[Laughter]
if that fish was a 9 8
it wouldn't have been a problem but it
being a 10-9 [ __ ] that whole thing up
for us pretty bad so let's cover up for
our mistakes um
i still want a dodo but
we're going to roll for now
i'm just going to be straight up with
you man i'm going to be straight up with
you
this is how we roll temporarily we want
a way to buff this dodo basically we
want a fish to show up sell the swan buy
the dodo play the fish buff everything
you're eating a dodo huh that's not i
know people will look at that and say
eating dodo forehead what are they doing
what they're doing is probably uh their
squad is so good they have nothing that
they can dump we lose by one
in order to put that dodo in a better
spot so i did they would they were doing
just fine there
this dodo is is too bad to function
right now it will not work
later sure for now
no
and we're not really close to getting
the penguin working either
so we gotta we gotta dig a little deeper
now i'm not gonna point out that this is
exactly what i was looking for to have a
chance to run the dodo um
[Laughter]
um but that's okay
i think there's a chance you could get
this worm popping it's we we gotta we
gotta do it fast
enjoy
oh
okay okay you know what just freeze one
of those it's still good
yeah yeah okay don't lose this one it's
only round seven this squad should be
able to do something here
whatever we we kill you in the in the
battle for the ages we kill you
holy bursh
dude we trade with their superfish no we
don't not not even close
but we do draw okay we draw with scaling
baron oh beef dip
don't be mad it's a little late to roll
this hippo involved
this worm is a big part of my
of my investment strategy
camel is better now
rooster will be nice to get please tell
me we're still scaling fast enough
eight eight eleven
you've you've killed my rooster it's not
great but life goes on
you peace your worm is me but stronger
look i'm just gonna say that's only
because it's an auto battler okay
if this was a manual battler i would
have used my superior gamer skill to
pilot my squad to victory even if we
were worse on paper
but because the uh um who whatever team
is stronger has to win otherwise they
cry
they take skill out of it and as a
result that you you get what you get
right there okay
beaver's okay but
it's not as good as fish
which can then be buffed by this son of
a gun rage oh mother you peace
inedible seeds
just needed that otter to hit the the
fish please instead of the horse
that's fine as expected double double
horse does double work early
i got to nine on a weird raccoon build
you playing on a on a on the beta patch
raccoon
you're a real piece of crap you know
that you're a real piece of work
i'm pivoting off of horse asap
even the rule double well i know but
this horse is a permanent 3-3 never mind
i'm staying on horse asap i'm freezing
the whole damn shop
no you can't do that just freeze the
horse okay
um
please please
like it's
it's hard for me to believe that this
squad
could lose round two
with what we got going on here
and yet like here we go doing it
how does this happen man
it's okay
we do this we do this this is a nice
buff you roll me
would it i
i don't know there's like four tier one
units
if we could just get one of these or one
of these or one of these that would be
nice
that's just that's all i'm saying is it
would just it would be nice to
to to see it happen
we can hold on we can do something here
you know what if you're mad about this
then i feel bad for you son
we're pivoting to complete horse-built
gameplay
forget the elephant
that's the play that's the freaking
plate oh you're gonna eat it next turn
you we're gonna be scary next year
please
that peacock is not that dude i would
settle for a draw any day of the damn
week right now
if we can get out of this one with a
draw
i i simply must become the joker
i hate this the early game free to play
is [ __ ] man
horse horse horse horse horse horse dog
dog horse horse horse qriket qriket
mosquito
pay to win early game
is that's the oh delicate
champagne this is just sparkling
nonsense
try the duck build
you can't just try a build
you have to get ducks in the shop have
you seen any [ __ ] ducks in our shops
begging for the location through text of
ducks in the shop
just roll a jackpot on a slot machine
just get pocket aces you need
the candidacy in the shop in order to
implement the strategy
in spite of all of this
i still think we can make it okay
i'm not i'm not rolling two winless in
one day
it's not happening
we don't
you can stick around
you're a absolute piece of
okay you know what
there you go that's how you play that
you [ __ ]
engage you so
much new piece of [ __ ] oh my god okay
okay sell me by me to make the dog
better
holy crap
i'm i'm having a damn meltdown man
killed my killed my
2-2 spider with upside it gave me a 3-2
badger
get owned
all right okay the math looks great for
you congrats
let's go
oh we lived a fight another day okay now
get out of my face
okay here's how you can start to rebuild
me
you gotta run the crap out of this dodo
man you you we gotta get rid of these
horses at some point
probably now is an okay time to at least
get rid of the horse
and then you can roll two
dodos right here
we're gonna get rid of the dog soon
don't don't doubt that
garlic on the camel
kangaroo turtle freeze the whole shop
please
that's fine that's fine oh he's eating
the damn hedgehog oh no
it's richard hammerbuild
is the camera build please
we all die
[ __ ]
oh okay there's a quick little windlass
hey but you know what it wasn't drawless
will anal get six wins or more
you know i know i want to run that build
man now i want to run that build okay
two of the same unit
like
fortune smiles upon us
one of the the dream build is when we
get the something piggies when we roll
full pig build
instead we gotta be you know like the
creamy sailors
this is a bad squad to start with by the
way but
yeah like you expect to lose early
all i ask is that like if you're playing
against me like
don't be a guest like sign in
okay you know
now we have a duck
this should be fun
full pig build what is he doing
dude i'm telling you it can work
it's swords
dude just trust me you just throw the
first three rounds okay and then you get
an early bison and you you steamroll
it's easy
this is great look at this
things are looking up already
okay we're no no we don't sell that duck
yet don't don't we sell that duck to
turn a 4949 into a 50 50. okay
so everybody just chill we don't need
anything else yet
probably a quick combine a roll me we're
fishing for a pig yes we are
um
meet me
i mean you got to start to look at it
sell me freeze me here i think please
draw
the win is too much to ask for
please draw
okay we're gonna we're just gonna have
to win out here
have bets ended at least
selmy
buy me
roll me
pick me
you piece
roll me
sell me
me
combine
me
combine me
it's so stupid
that's a big freeze though
the ox of the century
that's a huge buy me sell me i'm begging
you i'm begging you
okay it's a scary squad don't get me
wrong
it's not looking great
just pay out the doubters on that one so
i think um let's start this prediction
but i'm gonna make the submission period
one minute instead of two minutes
all right
pig build
it's probably not the right way to go
okay but it was fun we had fun
if you had five lives instead of four
that's a 10 win game
no doubt about it
we just we you know
that's that's how magic the gathering
works sometimes
you know if we if you had 25 life
games go a lot differently but they
don't
leaking geysers for sure
okay we this is you cannot do worse than
a draw unless you run against mosquitoes
three ducks thank you so much i really
needed this one
i greatly appreciate this thank you so
much
you're gonna be scary next year
i mean it's it's hard not to
not to roll this right here let me tell
you
holy boosh
this is this is a great early game squad
if you're a believer you should feel
like your points are in okay hands this
is a scary team
um
how did you get so many strong beavers
so early and yet i gotta tell you i look
at this and i say to myself
i think we do
okay we draw this one
just because of our horse on that one
that's lovely
so it's a nice plate
i do like a camel
i do like a turtle
this is a this is a squad man this squad
can do things okay you get
the horse is not long for this world but
that's okay you get a nice little camel
out there you get a nice little portal
out there
you roll once yeah maybe you freeze this
but you roll once after that
we're content where we stand
this is very nice
slash bb
lovely oh dude look at this freaking ant
dude holy crap
there you go we got finally we got the
sniffing feet
now we got a squad hey troy
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
one for every win we're gonna get from
this point onwards guaranteed
it can happen
i don't mind
i literally licked my lips i was like
turtle or a dodo
but i think for now we can sell a horse
sooner rather than later
in order to get a swan out there and
just say see you later
maybe like immediately
afterwards freeze me
because permanent melon armor gives us
some space
yeah this is
i mean we're getting a little freeze
happy but
this is i i'm freezing the whole we have
one more roll
freezing the the entire food shop
doesn't bother me as much as freezing
the entire uh
animal shop which we almost did anyway
but
easy place
this looks fine this looks fine
we love it
no sweat
lovely this is a lovely situation okay
you need a little juice
so we'll juice you
i think you buy a dodo and then pray
that this works for you excuse me my
dodo please
[Laughter]
now we're talking
all skill baby it's all skills
toasty
easy easy mode by the way oh excuse me
put it there you piece
okay that that was a great role
now we're becoming one of those squads
you don't want to run up against
little two for one with a dodo that uh
gets insane don't you freaking you know
what you're gonna
you're gonna come out of this with a win
you gotta get more more credit to you
more credit to you
more power to is the easiest play of my
life though um
send me we got i'm not sweating that
loss that's fine this is the easiest buy
me pill me of all time
kangaroo fits very nicely into this
build
so does ox though if you're just content
to like buy an ox and then pill
a uh a cricket in front of it but it's a
little it's a little too much work
i think this is like your this is your
classic squad dream
i mean i'm gonna be honest with you i
think you freeze a turtle
uh and we're gonna put this on you for
now but you freeze a turtle in the hopes
that you
can kill it
to give the kangaroo early melon armor
as well
i saw a great minds think alike by the
way
thanks for the extra proc really respect
it and appreciate it
your your garlic armor is going to get
you out of a just the slightest jam but
it it is the uh jam that is merely
slight
never mind it's gonna do some great work
for you never mind i win
you can sell a swan to roll a penguin
it's only buffing a cricket right now
but surely
surely that'll change
don't sleep on the penguin i'm telling
you
i'm telling you
it does it does amazing work i have so
many 10 pieces with this piece
you got you got to invest in some rolls
i that's not
an option
the roll please please
this turn is not going to be great
but it's worth it for our future
investment i
this i mean
a plus two plus two or plus one plus one
on the penguin is not what you want to
see there however
i
oh i'm still alive
that's okay
this is a loss
as expected
it's gonna happen
we need to get
out of here we don't need to can yet the
roles are of a higher priority you gotta
go like i know you're the only unit
getting buffed by the penguin right now
there's a very it's a perspective play
you gotta go
we can buy two roosters
we still have a useless penguin
you buy a can
and you buy one rooster freeze the other
one
we're so close to some level two units
i'm just begging you i'm just bergen
here
five five bus
absolutely no sweat
the turkey how do you get these turkeys
so damn early man
shit's driving me bonkers
isn't a turkey a tier vi unit
you need a tier five okay you need a
rooster
we can't we gotta get one of these
freaking
i know there's a cow i see him
you're joking
tier three tier three
tier four tier two tier four ox ox ox
sure sure let's get everybody no no no
okay now now we clip farm okay
any of our existing units
in the shop would get us there
so we got one of everything in our whole
shop before we got two of anything now
how this would be the clip of the
century
imagine if our shop was penguin rooster
dodo kangaroo camel
okay even better is [ __ ] none of them
there wasn't a level two ox in the shop
we we we had to sell like our whole
squad out just to be able to afford all
three
that's good okay we i mean this is a
loss man it's absolutely like
this is
i don't know what to say
like
just all things
it's still four that's not that bad but
like it's so
ridiculous
people were like counting up the amount
of money we spend in rerolls yeah we
spend a ton of money in reroll so sorry
sorry we need to delete this bet i
clicked end submission instead of
restart start again if you place bets in
the first 0.5 seconds you should do it
again here um
we we didn't get
any level uh level twos despite our 18
rerolls
that's it's just surprising it's all i'm
not it's not you know the game's fault
it's just
it's just variance but
it's a bummer for sure
we roll i'm sorry to freeze i should say
we roll with the freeze
the fatherly mushrooms
i do look i mean this it's a bit of a
conspiracy theory but now that chad has
told me that there are certain people
certain streamers even i'm ashamed to
say that i've seen
that when they don't get like the dream
build in the first three runs they just
abandon their arena and restart
i'm just look i've gotta i'm not trying
to brag necessarily i'm not trying to
say i'm a big shot
i have an open dm channel red telephone
on my desk that goes straight to team
wood games
i might have to pick that up a little
later today i might have to pick that up
and be like hey we gotta institute like
um
a competitive
penalty for people when they do that i
would say if you abandon an arena
that's no problem
if you abandon two arenas within an hour
your next game starts
with just sloths
your your tier one you just get
turn one you just get sloths one ones
with no upside you click the roll button
one ones with no upside one ones with no
upside and every abandon that you stack
up within 24 hours extends it by one
turn
just just for life
it could totally i i don't mind rolling
up against the team of level three
sloths because you know what i would
look at them and i would say not only am
i winning i'm vanquishing evil
devs please are you listening okay hold
on this is
i i lost what i was trying to do we can
put a b on a cricket throw some b's on
it we're gonna we're gonna roll this
qriket long term
no sweat
oh no sweat then we trade with the duck
this is a easy win
sloth only ladder
majestic
we like it
i guess this is a 3-3 either way huh
what
[Laughter]
okay um turtle's really good i don't
really want to replace
the bee in this current build but it's
not bad
i think you want to do something like i
think you want to like sell a mosquito
buy a spider and then put a turtle
in front of the spider just this is a
just for now situation
[ __ ] you dude you suck freeze me
[ __ ]
freaking dodo
dodo [ __ ]
be at the back
i this that i think it's a newbie trap
like don't take offense to it
but like i feel like mathematically it
doesn't do anything for you
psychologically it might make you feel
like it's like when it pops like that
you're like i did it because of the bee
at the back
but i don't think that's actually how it
works and the other thing is like um
i feel
that uh the b
gets buffed from the horse which is
quite nice
oh the b oh you know you're right okay b
needs to be further behind because we
don't have the space for it that's the
truth that was a temporary
uh this is actually really nice that was
just a temporary situation
because of the current layout that we
got going on here sheep is must play the
thing is we can't really
do it well here like we
well i suppose we could just do it like
that yeah what's that's fine
keep me scaling on the cricket
keep why not why not
you know we'll invest in leveling up our
units which could get us stronger units
this game is like an early um
it's an early game marty we're going up
against golden poop that means they
played
as much of the game as i have which is a
very scary thing to think about
love to get the snail out of the spider
but you know what hey at least he's a
4-2 man
you're gonna laugh
this this looks like a win to me man
big time big time
we can get a level three cricket so
there's already something to like there
um this this is an early game superstar
build for sure so there's some
combination of whale
is gonna work here but we're probably
gonna end up pilling the turtle for
um
melon armor my problem is that i want to
peel the turtle on
the whale
which means you don't laugh at me okay
sell spider
even though he's right here
buy me
buy me
buy me
no freeze me
pill me
by me
roll me
freeze me
don't really need garlic on anyone yet
maybe on our cricket if we keep rolling
it long term
but it the b does good for us right now
as well that that went well
that was a temporary sell buy
on our spider but we also got plus two
attack on it not that it matters because
it's gonna get eaten i guess but
and it says it's a snail every time of
the damn snail man
does nobody else see how absolutely
freaked this is at least that time it
was a giraffe no upside but at least
like is you know i can go to sleep at
night
dude this looks good as well
get owned yet again
giraffe urine sampler is their name
oh man
okay well this is big
rooster works well with this build but
there's nothing that i mean
what do you get rid of the fit of
rooster right now
you what you do is you freeze it and
then you think about it
at some point the cricket will not be
long for this world so we will probably
sell spider play rooster when the
rooster levels up we sell cricket move
rooster back play something else in
front like a deer
that sounds correct to me that sounds
apt
bad
pretty bad but i i respect it
so we're really more than anything else
we're looking for turkeys
um
we're looking for
tigers we're looking for flies we're
looking for sharks if we can get those
rolling
then then we're in a good spot
we lose that for sure no no oh but we
win those
but you're summoning this the splash
damage build is pretty bad for us
overall
yeah the kangaroo's gonna then the ox is
gonna be strong this one's a loss for
sure this is this is a strong uh this is
a strong build
if we even oh we're not even gonna get
to the ox
that is a that's a really that's a tight
build right there
my massive respect to you for sure
i still feel good about where we stand
whale's gonna stick around for a bit
let's let's give it a nice buff
let's give it a nice buff
honestly if we're gonna be
here i'd rather spit you know what no
i'd rather spend three gold on rerolls
so we're lo pair is fine we can hold
we want nothing
sadly we want nothing no no that's not
true we want a rooster yeah i you know
what that beats a one one for me that
beats a one one for me
another spicy build but i'm not scared
because of level 1 dodo at 2-4
we don't sweat those
we killed the camel
we hurt the kangaroo we spit out a
rooster
that spits out a rooster
once we get through this kangaroo it's
over for you
probably yeah yeah okay there we go easy
wins for the believers at least
that's a buy me i still think this is a
buy me it's a roll me we didn't get what
we wanted i'm gonna invest man like
we're gonna need some scaling at some
point but i'm never against a pair
this is a loss
it's one of the most understandable
losses in the game uh you have a hippo
and a monkey early on congratulations
i would do the same i'm not upset i'm
just saying you know
some of us prefer to try to
run skillful builds like for example
having a horse and a lot of units that
uh create other units when they die
this guy's going for 10.
can we just can i skip there should be
like a resign button
two lives remain
well
this is a this will work i know you're
like there's no space for it this will
work
you're gonna make me
you're gonna sell me
you're gonna place me
i don't mind this
i know that we lose one sheep out of
this it's worth it i'm telling you just
for being able to fit the snake in the
build is worth it then we buff you
one one ram is not worth that much for
us i've seen it done i've done it myself
freeze me is still pretty good roll me
what do we want to see the most
it would be nice to see another whale
short of a whale
you could sell
the horse and run a deer at the front
five hold on okay sell horse
five gold buy cow two gold
milk me
milk me
sell cow
three gold
buy deer
replace sheep no sheep is pog you don't
know
you don't know what you're talking about
maybe you do but
horse falls off don't care didn't ask
plus horse falls off
sell me
the main problem with the horse build
and you do so you do so well here you do
so well here you do so well here you do
so well here
you do so well here you do so well here
though you do so well in all these
you know what let's focus on the
positives you do well in both situations
yummy yummy
our thankfully our snake lives oh uh oh
tough luck
oops
own oh no you're dead and i killed you
oops
now i got a bus you're dead okay
get owned
this is better
than the sheep leveling up but
we need to figure out how we're gonna
handle this one okay
now i know
penguin gets two buffs
for plus one plus one
it's not quite good enough at this stage
imo it's not quite there
we really need to sell
i mean if we get a turkey we're selling
snake and we're running the ram
if we're gonna work something else out
here then we gotta sell the ram and run
the snake
i don't think the turtle fits i don't
think the rhino fits
i stand contented
we don't sweat those yet this is a big
re-roll
okay
we absolutely must sell snake roll shark
and the snake is it was doing amazing
work for us
but we need if we're gonna roll shark we
need to get the triggers from the sheep
although the snake is amazing the number
one reason i think people lose in this
game
coming from somebody that's lost many
times uh
today
when you try to straddle multiple
archetypes and you go wide instead of
going deep
that's when things get bad
it's not going to do damage your
scorpion is not going to do it's going
to get smoked
my sheep goes down gives us many great
triggers there oh this is like it's
locked this one's locked in
you if you're gonna make a snake work
you gotta build around it you know it's
like managing together you can't just
like uh shove an arch archangel avacyn
into every deck
now you can probably shove like a turkey
into every deck
you can shove a uh
atlanta war elf into every deck but you
the snake is highly
great but situational
we really want
we want a lot here
we want more than pizza can give us this
is huge
little melon little salad
tiger wood would slap
this is really bad it's the any i i
honestly think tiger is probably the
strongest unit in the game anytime you
see it you basically just gotta be like
this is not good
it it would be a big stretch for us to
somehow find a way out of this one
although can i tell you and i'm i'm
looking and i'm saying to myself hold up
hold up hold up
get bent
there you go
that's nine wins
thank god we didn't have a snake there
it would have been killed
i think you definitely like a melon on
your rooster freeze me roll me
i don't see us getting by the end of the
game i do not see us getting a whale
to
level three it's just unlikely
um
but
could i see us getting a deer to level
two
it's possible
i think you can free no don't freeze
pizza roll for chocolate
maximum chocolate place
you have to put a fly
the fly has to go somewhere
i do not want to cut a whale would
people cut the sheep are you insane
[Laughter]
fly instead of sheep
sheep
gets three faint triggers if we sell the
sheep and put the fly in we get one
two
three a bus
you know what it could work
all right maybe i'm the insane one i did
think about cutting deer
and then putting the uh you know you
don't want to put rooster in front you
lose a faint
or you lose a couple faints i think but
you could put a whale in front but
here's the thing let's just go through
it logically okay let's case a
we sell a sheep buy a fish or buy a fly
how many faint triggers do we get one
when the whale eats it creates a bus
the so there's one bus dies two
whale dies three
deer that the whale spits out dies we
get four
busts that the deer spits out dies we
get five
and then hold on these are all also
creating flies
but like the first three won't have any
extra capacity to go anywhere
so we're probably looking at like seven
let's say that's seven
faint triggers
just for
proof of concept okay
then the fly dies
and everything else is equal
now if you were to sell the deer
and then roll the fly behind the sheep
you get one when the whale dies
the whale creates a fly so you get two
hold on
sheep dies
you get one
then you get two rams but no fly so you
get two more which takes you to five
you know what
if we're going to roll fly and i think
we have to
you don't put fly behind come on
you gotta
the you need
oh well okay behind rooster you can make
it well no you can't well maybe you can
i don't know anyway long story short i
think i think you're right i think this
is the play
and you pill it so that you also get a
trigger
thank you
and then you roll it like that which
then gives you the x yeah we're worried
about getting sniped but you're always
worried about getting sniped
this is big
we have two lives to play with to win
one game it's doable it's doable
it's not perfect like you would prefer
not to have a whale and a deer taking up
you know two
spaces here but at least they're also
giving us faint triggers
it's something level one turtle that's
not that bad
i don't mind seeing a level one turtle
we knew this was coming um
at least our sharks getting built off
this
yo are roosters gonna get you
that's so lucky we we should win this
this should be a win
i mean it's definitely a win
look at my freaking shark man
got a little close
got a little close with the fatherly
mushrooms
10 wins
how do all these people
have
enough points to buy
i'm i'm getting like this is people
accuse me of like how much be honest how
much super auto pets did you play this
weekend and i'm like i don't know
[ __ ] like three hours then i go to
uh other people's streams and justin was
telling me today he he's played enough
to get the golden poop hat and then he
has like another 4 000 points stored up
that's crazy man
anyway we can run one turbo run back as
soon as possible
i'm not mad i'm happy by the way i'm
just i'm just saying
i do play some on guests that's that is
true i cannot tell a lie
the order on this sucks pretty bad but
i'm i'm overall not displeased with this
good team name please
be a shy streamer it's it's got many
things going for it i am a streamer i
can be a little shy and it's got
alliteration that's a dream uh name this
is a loss
no it's a draw actually a very lucky
draw but a draw nonetheless when you're
one one beats of uh
a four one you're not shy at all source
dude just trust me
okay
well you freeze
and then you run me
and then you
be
me and just make sure you combine
nicely
this is this is a nice squad now that
we're going up against the spicy squad
in its own right no questions there but
i like what we got going on here
yeah that's a win right there
good
yes good
for now
should have somehow realized what you
got to do
what we got to do first is
this horse
you're gonna hate me okay but like get
ready
because we're not gonna be rolling a
full squad here
but you're not gonna have enough space
to spit out your damn bee you know what
okay hold on
hold the front door you start here
forget a camel
this is majestic
you know what we don't need us you know
what i'd like a swan we don't need a
second flamingo we can start building
our dream team
i guess it would have had enough space
because it would have just pushed the
units back a little yeah that's true
that's true no horse equals i'm not that
scared here
oh dude freaking 5-1 getting spat out
there oh my god
oh baby another easy win
i i if we could get to an early tier
three horse
i would say that my
my words and my deeds i i am ashamed of
so temporarily it's an easy pill me
don't come by me you
so we could roll you like this
and focus on some buffs but that's not
smart
we don't need a swan that we can do
better
my eyes actually lit up i was like
oh man
oh i don't have enough space city i
don't have enough to buy the meat bone
all right freeze me
freeze me
that's fine this is still a really good
team right here
similar squad very similar squads roll
in here
honestly like i think i might overrate a
whale but it's just so fun like it's
just it's one of the most fun units to
have
this looks fine man this looks
fine well you definitely pill me
this is going a long way towards making
our horse like a little bit more useful
in the long term
you want to get the double level if
possible
you we could roll an ox look i know that
this doesn't create as many units the
the units we've been creating have been
really good i think you can freeze an ox
and we'll do that as like a last-ditch
effort holy bursh
i've made a grave error
uh you know what now you can do that
this is still really good i i
unlike many people i don't sweat
period
no i don't i don't sweat um
a four squad as long as there's a good
reason for it
and this is
weird
but
we're doing some serious damage like are
you see we're trading with their good
units with our [ __ ] units
like i remember i read uh a comment on
the super auto pad subreddit that was
like
you know if you ever roll a four squad
after like turn two then you're
gonna lose i'm like well
maybe you would me
i'm not so sure
either way we are gonna do the
combinatorics that's not the word we
love it we love a deer no question we
love a deer here
um
giraffe just doesn't fit an ox does
fairly well
like
our horse
needs a little something extra but i
think you can honestly roll like a ox
out here
and then freeze two pills and you're
gonna laugh
your ass off
because when we
we're gonna pill this son of a [ __ ]
two times and our ox is gonna take off
man
this is a heavy roll this is a roll
investment forget you
we're gonna have space so that's a
freeze that's a just in case freeze
i don't know where we go from there the
next thing we want is good units like we
we have a squad that has incredible
synergy we just need good units now like
we need to find a way to get a late game
build to start working
with some scaling and then i feel great
then i feel like a million bucks
by the way get owns
you notice how like your your whole
squad fell apart due to the chili pepper
sad
it's right on the borderline man i think
you can roll
the ox will go you buy a bison you put
it at the front you buy a monkey you put
it at the back you keep that horse for
the time being you keep this cricket for
the time being
sell me
unfreeze me
unfreeze me buy
me which means we're gonna have to start
pivoting these out of here
it's gonna take a bit it's probably a
good time to freeze the snail quite
frankly things could go a little a
little off here
you need to keep your horse
yeah cricket pill no longer makes any
sense without an ox but a cricket cell
is fine
and we could keep you around
for a bit
i don't mind keeping you around for a
bit you know you still do do stuff back
here
we could do a little half pivot it's
been known to happen
spicy rolls
with the if you're pivoting cans are a
must man
freeze me
i love my freezes here
we're we're a 1411. oh he should have
frozen some garlic a little garlic on
you would do some slappers
great great stuff
nice nice little smacks we get a nice
little deer out here that's going to
ruin your life
and everything's still going according
to plans somehow
despite the fact that we
blew up our whole squad from the inside
out
there's the believer payout already
it's definitely a a get well you know
what this actually gets you to a six six
so
start there
freeze me
roll me
just gonna say i wanted to see some
garlic on this guy welcome to the
welcome to the squad
that deer and the whale are not here
long term so i i don't want to invest
we got to find a way to get to 10 wins
now
and that's that's not an easy task
you piece
look at my whale man i'm going to
valhalla
that's the easiest win in my life
if deer and whale go horse should go too
yeah but we need the horse to bump nice
this is going it's go and don't get me
wrong it's going
take take a pair
i think it's more
important that
the monkey gets the buff
because it applies the same effect
you got to do it on the monkey because
the monkey is is
you can you can change who gets the buff
and the buff will exist even if we sell
our horse
it's not bad to
no it's kind of bad disregard what i was
going to say about it not being bad this
is a roll situation
can me
i believe in the future of this can
whale mammoth not that good it's not bad
i just think the thing is you'd like to
have a mammoth up at the front but we
can't have a mammoth up at the front
because it'll steal the buff we want our
bison to get from our level 2 monkey
um
which is kind of like a non-starter
unfortunately
so instead i'm like ah well
just do what you got to do then this is
this is a draw well okay we're starting
to run up against it um
black truffler thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
that was a win again my mistake
well you know in that case i think we
should invest in a deer
let's get this deer pumping
heavy phrasing energy there
let's get the whale going no disrespect
this is this was a good shot for us
i mean we're eight wins at 10 turns like
that's a dream scenario
turkey monkey they're still in their
scaling phase which i mean so are we but
at least we killed the monkey
trade ya
we there we drew on that one
i'm happy where we stand okay
i think you unfreeze
i know we held that frozen for a long
time we unfreeze to take the best chance
possible to look for some chocolate
no no no it's not it's not the play
you're gonna get eaten honestly if we're
gonna stick with the horse for the time
being you can definitely stake a horse
this bison got to 35 35 pretty quick
[Laughter]
look if you're going to hit me with the
realies like i understand but you got to
keep in mind we're like flack right now
we're lossless so
you're kind of being met with deaf ears
as a result of the fact that
you know like we're pogging you're so
freaking lucky if we got through one
more unit
that dog was getting destroyed
okay garlic
it's it's early enough it might work
i'm gonna try it on you
it's not my ideal setup that kinda is
though
freeze me
i'm gonna give this one more buff i
think you sell the horse
to put the snake behind the whale
but i'm gonna give you
one salad first
just cause i'm like i know that this
build can win
so let's take the last buff on the bison
from the horse
oh dude this is a great run for splash
damage for us and i think it's also
turkey at least it's turkey
uh even though it's level two
it's turkey and uh
fly instead of turkey tiger like turkey
tiger would be sending us to the shadow
realm right now it's still pretty bad
don't get me wrong
like this is this is where it starts to
fall apart
[Laughter]
it just never ends man it just did
that's where you want a rhino but you
know
can't always get what you want
um
two lives remain give me a roll for now
okay that's hard to say no to
sell the horse
buy a can
and then if there is a god
i was gonna say give me another snake
but that's okay
i didn't have the gold for it i planned
i planned poorly
there's a there's a philosophical
difference okay you can roll
snake behind bison and it seems like the
most sensible option because the bison
is so much hp however
uh you might and in many circumstances
in the late game
will in my opinion only get oh you
freaking piece
one
trigger out of it because they're just
even if you have like 30 hp they're just
gonna kill you i guess with with 47
they're not going to kill you so you
know what i i could accept that this is
a way you get some guaranteed triggers
on this is is the
is the methodology that i chose but
you need melon on your bison okay
so
the monkey getting got for a turtle is
good
and we're hoping to pill
that's big
the problem is you're gonna laugh tiger
snake is amazing
but it's not that good
if our
bison gets one tapped
the bison with melon armor man
it's technically you could sell whale
and roll tiger behind snake and yeah you
know what i like that this is a it's an
incredibly late game pivot
but i i believe
still okay
let's give it a try
when the deer at the back is fairly
uncommon but
let's give it a try
the deer is not gonna get to do anything
nor is the tiger
because we happen to run into a badger
at the front
holy crap
we still we still won
i was like i was sure we were gonna lose
because the badger build like
oh badger doesn't hit everything it only
i was thinking a hedgehog
oh and that's not even 10 wins there's
nine wins what am i talking about
okay forget pizza man i mean turtle
honestly turtle with a little chili
pepper we want to peel you but if you
purchase a melon armor there i'd be a
very happy camper
that's why i didn't freeze the melons
okay well hold on
it's better this way
i want you at the front i don't want the
deer at the front because i'm like
a deer at the front if they have a deer
it's gonna screw up our melon armor i'd
rather have our melon armor hit on
something that's like a little more
valuable give me a a decent leopard
you could you could make a fly pop here
you could
you could move a deer up
no you could keep the deer there
and just roll a fly behind and get one
extra hit out of it
yeah yeah that's the ticket
if we draw we're gonna want that
it's more about getting the extra plays
it's not gonna hit it hit
cause melon only blocks 20.
but it's okay this is why we have the
fly so we still get two extra triggers
on that oh good it killed your pig
you're a piece
that score it's the scorpion of the
century what can you say
it got the job done
i'm telling you as well we shoot some
kangaroos early instead of shooting some
you know the the needless like seven
nine pig
they get creamed on
it's all good still a nine win victory
deer in front would have won yeah and if
you went back to wednesday last week and
put your life savings into atz.t.o the
origia clothing company you'd be up 40
right now
it's a the the hindsight is 2020 is not
a meme that died in the previous
calendar year
believers get paid out
if you know the conditions of the future
then you just tailor the past for that
but the future is cloudy it's unknown

feels so empty without sap nah nah nah
nah nah
um
dude cage show me last night i know
we're starting with uh
with a little non-sequitur here
kate showed me last night something on
instagram she said there's no way this
could be real right and in korean it
said
epic eminem
fail or it's like like
prank right and they should so eminem's
in the crowd of this awards show and
he's like looking up and then there's
somebody in like an angel outfit
um that's being pulled on wires like
across the ceiling and then the wires
kind of like snap
so they're they're
like all they're upside down and then it
lands
the person lands on top of eminem with
their butt in his face and he's going
uh kate was like there's no way this was
not staged right
[Laughter]
i'm pretty sure that was staged
that this oh that was it was sasha baron
cohen
but you know i i feel like on korean
instagram maybe it's the same on on
english instagram but like if you
weren't
alive when it happened or if it happens
in another country and maybe you don't
understand the language like when you're
watching it you're like holy crap it's
crazy that it happened to fall just on
eminem if it fell on anybody else it
would have been funny but it it felt
right on eminem like with his butthole
right in his face anyway what are we on
here are we on run free to play that's
good okay
that was forever ago it couldn't have
been that old because eminem had the
tattooed fouseytube hairline
i don't know if he actually got the the
fouseytube uh
hair tattoo surgery but you know what i
mean
like he he didn't have the bleach blonde
marshall mathers he had like the
he had like the the lego dracula hair
you know you know what i mean oh no the
bets what am i talking about sorry hey
do we i i shouldn't be talking too much
about uh
hair i mean come on by the way i was
playing a little this on my phone last
night
let me tell you like if you are just
getting into super auto pets
if you get to 10 wins you're actually a
legend like the overall elo of this game
has gone up so much
um if if you don't
have
i don't know i would say like
a 15 15 creature by turn five like
you might as well just quit and restart
like people have gotten so good at the
damn game
it's actually crazy
anyway roll me
it's not that bad i i i've come to
believe
that a mosquito is
the worst possible acceptable unit on
turn one
that's my take on it
i think this is the the worst playable
unit
pig oh sorry i'm an intern
pig is okay like it but you get value on
cell like you can't afford to we'll be
the milky minerals you can't afford to
be um
to be throwing away your early rounds
anymore no offense brit brat who's
rolling two level one ducks
what happened
they didn't need it like
two level one unbuffed ducks i don't
even know what happened
it's not even really like a duck build
you couldn't just put like an otter or
something on the side you can roll a
cricket in fact i i feel compelled to
add a qriket to the squad
roll me
we will roll a second mosquito
and we will also put a
b on the cricket this is a good drawable
build right here
nothing wrong with that
i mean i i am now in in the meta where
like i feel like the best thing that you
can possibly do you you peace
oh we tied okay
is just win or draw early which would
normally be like obvious
but it's not that obvious anymore
because you know there was a time where
it felt like you could throw your early
rounds to get scaling going faster
if you lost two one or two times in your
first two rounds but you had a bunch of
ducks you're like that's no big deal now
i'm like
every
uh by turn six you're running up against
somebody who's got like a tiger turkey
build going on and you're like holy crap
like i i need every hit point that i can
get
okay freeze me
we will combine
and play we need to get a another level
you piece
your piece
but you already knew that um
you know
this is tough
you almost have to keep a dodo around
you're a piece
there we go finally freaking finally man
um you almost have to keep a dodo around
just just for the squad
i think you'd combine here freeze me
freeze me this is good stuff
why do they all have berets i'm still
farming up golden poop uh it's a long
way away
this squad's pretty nasty gotta got a
lucky play there man it's been so long
since i had a good spider payout like
there's been no upside on the spider
payouts lately this looks horrible um
yeah this is a loss to be expected is
pay to win worth buying absolutely the
thing is like
what i would say about uh pay to win
this is this is pretty good
is that it's very nice to um
to get sick of running into horses
turkeys
uh tigers and flies
and then you know you pay five dollars
once and now you're like okay time to
get just absolutely slapped in the face
by bats over and over
it's it's when you get sick of one build
you're just like i ate
you gotta nerf turkey man nerf turkey
and then you go to you flip to the other
side and you're like nerf bats nerf bats
okay so i do think we want
to have a dodo like this
um
i really want a whale to eat this spider
i mean this ants
so i i think this is fine for the time
being i do want to peel the ant i know
we've had it frozen for a bit this is
not a good squad this is like
it's merely
uh passable we're going up against the
four squad marty
doesn't look too bad
that's fine this is this is why we have
melon armor in the first place oh let's
go dude the spider
look i saw a comment that said i
overrate spider
you're absolutely right there's no doubt
about it and i will not invest in the
spider any further you have my word um
but sometimes if you if you need
two faint triggers you're like fine no
sweat
i
this is kind of bad though like is
it's a little stinky i'm not gonna buy
it
it this he merely exists for the time
being now i'm just trying to get you to
level up would it kill you
what if we did
hear me out here you can definitely kill
an ants even though i like the buff
that's not really what i was looking for
play your strong unit up at the front
this is still okay oh you do it in front
of the ox you piece
um
i don't mind rolling a a temporary
kangaroo
that could become
it's pretty it's pretty cool but
you know it's pretty i got to be honest
what if you ran the badger up there
what if we what if we tried badger ox
as long as we get the melon armor before
you do the attack
i didn't keep the ox what's wrong with
me okay keep always keep a pill around
there you go we got our ox back you
would want garlic on a kangaroo if we're
gonna keep it right yeah just freeze the
whole [ __ ] shop
just freeze the whole damn shop non-stop
okay great mosquito
hippo at the back i see your point
what the hell
son of a
my melon armor
all right this is a loss
okay yeah you need the faint trigger
first like i got a little too big for my
britches here
um this is okay though so we look the
mosquito is good but
this is do it on okay you need to keep
that mosquito for a second just for a
second we're gonna get this going
this is now new technology so prepare
yourself for new technology
nice that's a great buff
i'm a sick buff i like a quick buff
roll me
another level ox is like this top tier
goods
can't help but feel that we might
benefit from
temporarily
i'm just thinking
just thinking i think we could bring
back a kangaroo temporarily freeze the
ox
yo ox
let me get a melon armor badger front
nine six mosquito level three yes sir
okay we have a bus that's bad news
oh and let's go though uh you peace
that's terrible news
yeah okay this
someone in chat was literally like it's
badger ox is really good until you
encounter a bus and wouldn't you know it
right right off the bat
it's not great okay let me get a bacon
body brown sauce on a roll nice cup of
tea yes sir
you already know the vibe that's pretty
good
i'm thinking
dude i think we i think we try i still
think we can do this just no whale deer
please that's it you give me no whale
deer
we win the game and we play to win the
game herb brooks
this could be bad though
okay okay hold on
dude these dolphins new dolphin meta
just dropped
you're a piece uh never mind you're not
a piece get killed
get killed
get killed kill me you piece
okay
do a long neck dino build uh that will
require me to get to like turn six
which we haven't been doing a good job
of so far all right we're gonna pay out
the the doubters on that
one then we're gonna run it back start a
prediction start prediction will we run
it back one minute on the bets
we tried something new okay
that would require me to give a damn
yeah yeah exactly
exactly i think
okay now this week we like this this is
a
very good start
this is a very good start on the
free-to-play build
maybe the sticky seeds
this this round does not lose early
it might draw but it does not lose early
and it also does not draw early at all
it wins early
the edible glasses
there's our first win
okay trip trip ant build is just
disgusting
get another ant going here
uh and then
put a little b throw some bees on it
just got a three one and i gotta do you
think rich boy is rich boy still alive
would he be mad if i if i made a parody
that was like throw some bees on it
yo we're popping we're popping he died
in 2004 i'm pretty sure that song is
from 2005. i didn't know that was one of
the rare posthumous number ones on the
billboard hot 100.
um
do it
do it dude a sheep with a horse like
throw some sheep on it look at that
that's that's some top tier stuff this
is not a this is still an unlosable
situation right now
you throw another ant in here
i don't even think you freeze a pill i
think you roll once we were looking for
another ant we didn't get one hey man
that's life
let me tell you something
i mean for now
i think you throw a b on this it makes
them so less playable
yeah we could throw a bee on this
cricket real quick
throw some bees on it i actually kind of
like that we have an unleveled horse
because it makes it that much easier to
get rid of in the future now it's a
nasty ox okay i would never dispute the
nastiness of said ox
however
we got our own trade right here your
your 6'4 ox ties to two pieces of crap
regardless oh look at that now we got
two more pieces of crap they kill your
piece of crap we win again
we don't need a spider we could fit it
we don't need a spider
although hold on i actually kind of like
the idea of just
like
why not at this point just tossing
another spider out here and then
we're one away from getting another
level
don't let the anti-spider rhetoric
lead you to believe it's never takeable
if there was any build that fit a spider
it would be this one right here
all right you're that's a that's heavy
you piece energy
but i still believe in the squad
i i i no longer believe in the squad
that was that was a heck of a shot
honestly oh although a badger and a
mushroom mushroom no no okay we came
close is honestly just because of your
mosquito like if your mosquito hadn't
hit our horse
we had no problems
but it did
so we have problems
go ahead
you you can see our conundrum this is fi
level five
who are you who do you think you are i
am
we still need our horse around i think
that much was proven
i'm gonna dump this in favor of a a
temporary dolphin
you can't sell the horse to do it you no
the horse is so mission critical on this
build
the horse generates
one
two three
four five it generates
five extra attack it's very important
i'm not selling my spy are you insane
it doesn't solve our problem man we this
one you just gotta own the fact that i
can't do math
it's been known to happen before we
might lose this round believers don't
don't don't cry don't cry
they have no dolphin their kangaroos
gonna be a piece for sure but you know
what we smack you
this is not that bad hey we go do it a
5-4 giraffe crushes your freaking ants
we we lose by one that hurts
but you know what it means that we were
close
you lose the stats but the double buff
is quite nice much much nicer than a
dolphin imo we have something to do with
this this is where we get ourselves out
of the out of the mess that we were in
take a permanent buff
get ready prepare yourself we're getting
out of this please play slower
heavy believer energy
i can't be mad
we got a level one
oh dude that dodo chick situation is
kind of nasty
get owned get owned we're still owning
we break your melon armor in a
productive fashion
oh we trade
with your 13-3 dies to a 3-3 uh-oh
you peace
well done it takes us to win four
i wasn't even scared for a second i
would not mind a level three ants
if the mood strikes your eye like a big
pizza pie
some point we're gonna want to get out
of this build i don't think the time is
right yet
we're going quite heavy on the rolls i
don't think anybody would disagree with
this
freeze me a pair
i got the utmost confidence man
one more a win here would strike nicely
i don't see a deer i see a kind of a bad
dodo
and i don't see a horse i think this
squad is going to be bad for us in the
future like they're going to be better
than us
later for now
i think they also now that i look at it
they might be better than us now
you don't see a deer hey what i meant
was a whale or a horse i can't remember
okay
this you're kind of you're kind of nasty
you're kind of nasty garlic armor does
so well against uh summon build well
done well done
i feel like you overrate horse
approximately half of every super auto
pet stream is me talking about the fact
that i think horse is kind of dog [ __ ]
you just find yourself in a it you know
it's like it was one of those things you
know
like when you have uh
when your run is built around the horse
you need to get exactly the right
conditions in the meta to get out of it
you know
like you you we kind of have to pivot
either slowly and nicely or we have to
pivot like uh
all at once which we don't have the
swans to really pay
i penguin sucks here like you're gonna
make me say it you sell the horse you
buy a penguin your aunt gets buffed
doesn't matter because it gets eaten
immediately your spider gets buffed
doesn't matter because it dies in one
hit nothing else gets buffed this is you
have to you don't have to keep a horse
for now but you can't replace it with a
penguin
my dream
is that the servers do not crash
and then
i'm not afraid of a can if we're going
to be replacing our horse soon
okay
sell me a horse
buy me a deer
and then just keep me
alive for the time being please
this would be a big win for the
believers
five five bus with splash you getting a
turtle out of that
that's a slap in the face
it's simply a slap in the face this
kangaroo is gonna be pretty nasty
you got a spider that's all right we're
gonna get a deer out of it
this looks really bad
what are you what are you getting out of
that spider if you get a turtle i'm
gonna lose my damn mind
blowfish is not this is a loss look at
this squad man
[Laughter]
this is it's like turn eight look at
this go just resign i resign
get me out of here
four wins okay pay out the doubters
i'm telling you the overall elo has like
it's gone way up
run me back
it's functional
you know what because there's two of
them we can roll this squad this is
this is a 50 50 squad right now but i
don't sweat it
we will be
the gushing submarines
james gaming
sorry to tell you you just got blown out
by north america's number one super auto
pet streamer
this is amazing
freeze me once roll me because we don't
have to roll three ants i will and we'll
just
toss a bee
throw some bees on it even though we're
likely to peel you in the future
you might be number one worldwide oh you
rubius isn't playing this
come on rubies you get hop on the super
auto pets train
oh i know you're too busy playing
probably like far cry 6 or something
like that
i've got can i hit you with something i
i thought of this it's a new social
media trend that i'd like to start it's
called um
ubisoft stop making far cry's 2021
challenge
they've failed it for about a decade
straight
but i'm gonna i'm gonna give them a
little bit of credit okay because like
far cry 3 was
really good
far cry 4 was more of the same
but it was still fun
far cry 5 was where i was like i'm kind
of sick of this
and far cry 6 i was just like even
giancarlo esposito hello hector cannot
give me back you can't get me back in
the game
eventually they're gonna run out of
better call saul actors right
they had uh
what's what's the guy's name he he's um
you know he's the salamanca he's but
he's he's in the salamanca family
nacho
yeah yeah yeah
yeah dude there you go bill bill burr
far cry 7 starring bill burr
bill burr is on a long road trip
but acts his car breaks down right
outside of a liberal arts college and he
has to debate his way out of a women's
studies class
while being high on pcp there's it's far
cry 7.
billboard tries to avoid getting
canceled at
university of berkeley california
17 sam adams is deep okay we're not we
don't need to we don't need to run a
combinator combinatorics here um we can
just roll once
and roll whence
i think you freeze
you can definitely run a combine here
and i yeah yeah let's let's you peace
it wasn't necessary and then roll a swan
as well
do it i would love to snipe oh if we
could snipe like an enemy horse with
this mosquito
you know we're gonna see one i mean come
on this is just you know put me in the
clip
[ __ ] you
[Laughter]
as soon as the words left my mouth i
knew it was gonna happen
okay okay this is looking pretty good
you're not getting through our 9-7 man
there's no chance
three wins in a row already
we definitely like a combination
we don't have to do it with this same we
could do it here first save ourselves
some money
um
i'll be honest with you
i'm a sick frick i like a quick frick
but i also feel like the ant i think the
ant does better as being eaten right now
because of the the i mean basically
we're getting a 6-3 buff
i think you can roll a turtle
in a temporary capacity and then when
you get a pill
pill the turtle
in front of the whale to get melon armor
on the whale and keep the ant up there i
respect it
okay
let's do so immediately
one of these
yummy yummy
um
roll me
continue to roll me we can afford to be
a little spice straight here
freeze me roll me
no no no give me one more ants
i know it seems a little goofy this is
still a it's a strong team right here
for now i mean we're going up against a
strong team as well i wouldn't debate
that i would not dispute this it's a
strong ant we're going up against here
but that's the buff we're not looking
for really a nine six shrimp huh
nine six shrimp that's a that's a spicy
team right there you got a good thing
going on
this is a great time for his snail man
get him going
snail me
scampi build
can't be f'd honestly keep that ant
going for the time being now this is
where things get mighty interesting
wouldn't you suggest
dude i don't know i'm kind of like
what if you had
a whale
eat
a badger
because it has 5'4 to begin with
you could you know what it's a i i know
look we got 57 of people on the side of
belief here
but
i love meta i love mixing up the meta
okay
now i'm worried about what's gonna
happen when this son of a gun spits out
a badger okay
um so we need to buff our ants to have
one more
hold on shut the [ __ ] up
i don't i know this is gonna override
the beat i don't give a [ __ ] okay sorry
for the language grilled clams
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
this squad is gonna work you're and
honestly like you're gonna be
absolutely ashamed

everybody just relax this is actually
totally fine
you can roll this just just as a as a
as part of the squad just this part of
the squad okay
juice me
an ox fits nicely with what we got going
on okay i'm a little off the deep end
here okay but when it works holy crap
when it works if i did it ready for this
look at this immediately oops your
mosquito's dead
as a result of your mosquito being dead
oops your peacock didn't even stand a
damn chance oops your turtle's dead
now we got one badger oops uh your
whale's dead
and now i got a freaking giraffe going
up against your spider it worked
it worked
we ran up against the the exact perfect
squad for us to run up against
okay the next strategy is to be aware of
the fact that we're gonna have to pivot
as soon as possible
so i think you double can
here's my impression of the average
gamer no your build's too cool sell the
badger run a deer like everybody else
you know what
read between the lines that's what i say
about that
in this world there's two kinds of
gamers okay
there's gamers
who write icy veins and there's gamers
who read icy veins
i'm a writer
now this aux is pretty good
we need to buy i i want to buy you know
what
honestly i'm just going to be honest
with you you suck
get out of my face
we're going to play an ant at the back
because i'm
out of my mind
we're gonna run an ox right there
he's gone mad
golden poop that's not fair
oops get owned okay
the owning is not yet stopped thanks for
the melon armor
get smacked
get smacked by the way thanks for the
melon armor
get smacked
we don't quite kill you on a smack
that's a draw baby
we're still in this we take these
i just watched richard jewell on netflix
great movie
i like the part where he says shut up
youtube brodies leave the canola and
leave you gibroni
i like that actor
i forget what's his name
the the his nemesis joey salads
jimmy taco that's right not joey salads
okay okay yeah yeah we can run a worm
man absolutely don't you know and
haven't you heard
haven't you heard that the the worm is
the word
that seems bad
you know what that seems oh no uk freeze
me
roll me oh baby
why not dodo it's too meta
we're an anti-meta marty now we make our
own meta and substitute our own
not a great start i mean the blowfish is
just really strong honestly
you're dead which is great for us
we're alive which is even better for us
in my opinion
what do you got there little flamingo
[Laughter]
oh
oops we won
what does the worm do he get big
this whole thing is he he get big so
will buffy honestly we gotta buff you
you get you gotta scale like a freaking
madman we're looking for a warm we don't
get a warm
it's okay we scale you like a madman
even further that ant doesn't need to
buff quite yet this is the believer win
with the new meta
let's take it slow we kill you this
kills the spider the spider does not
spit out a turtle it spits out a useless
giraffe like a piece of junk okay the
hippo is gonna is gonna pop slightly but
then
it's gonna eat it
from the badger then it's going to get a
nice buff after it dies which is very
funny as we know
we're going to trade with the dog your
second dog we're going to trade and then
we got a 17-17
against a uh 21-19 against the 2-1
shrimp no sweat there you go that's
that's six wins pay out the believers
and can i tell you there was never a
doubt in my damn mind get buffed
get popped
roll me
what does a level two badger do does
anybody know okay the ant is good the
worm needs to scale a little faster you
use it on the worm instead for now
it does more damage okay yeah yeah well
i mean look you can level up the whale
too i think it's more important than we
do this though
ah i mean a snake is a it's a nice play
but it kind of takes the place of the ox
um but is better and you'll get hit a
little bit um
it's tough freeze me for now we don't
have to think about it till the next
round
the ant must go i'd like to i'd like to
pill it this is a scary squad man are
you seeing this squad
this is your meta squad like if you want
to go watch wilbur's stream like don't
let me stop you quite frankly if you
want to see
a
giraffe that has buffed a level 3 dodo
monkey buffing like a turtle at the
front
for eight hours a day go watch that okay
we're redefining the meta on our own
terms over here
and i'll do it again
we're gonna try probably should have
canned but
what about
what about putting the one up no that's
not good that's that's not smart um i
don't think we need to level our badger
no you don't want up it because like if
it one-ups you could one-up a snake but
if you want up a badger it comes back as
a 1-1 so then it gets hit and does one
damage to the thing that it uh
to it to adjacent units which we don't
care for
big rolls
what about a quick pizza roll for my
worm
okay the rhino it it frightens me
thunderbolts and lightning very bro what
the oh
oh
and then we're doing 10 damage to you
you peace
and to me as well okay okay that did not
go as planned
that's fine look at that though six wins
the exact
level of belief we'll do one more free
to play here that was a fun one honestly
like i like uh
i like going on a jank build
much more than just oh a turkey fly
again turkey fly
it's a great start
that's a roll and a half in my world oh
a little ant sandwich
there's a lot you can like here
there's a lot you you know what for all
the double entendres i kind of like the
idea of the running bikers
like a it's the hell's angels 5k
it's just the humorous sentence to think
about
it's a draw
yeah guys they got motorcycles
and a lot of other stuff too
you don't run a horse here you do this
i don't think we want i think we can
afford the the roll here oh
charlie
oh ouch charlie
sorry that's now a copyright
infringement because there's some minted
nft right
but that's fine i'm referencing the
video i'm not referencing the pointer
where the video resides owns
owns
owns that's a win
this is great stuff this is this is
very nice
should have bought a swan first i just
forgive me i got
eager
give me two swans for a moment roll me
i i like where i stand
apple me
i say nay to a peacock yeah i'm not uh
i'm not fully sold on the on the peacock
meta either
you're a that's just honestly like just
congrats you got ants big whoop
okay we got 12 gold
now i will say
i think we're early enough to try to go
meta and get a dodo run in here
so i think
we do this
we're really fishing for two pills
run this on you for the time being
that's draw protection one pill this is
good pill one ant hit the dodo you peace
it's all right you know why it's all
right
this spider is gonna spawn a turtle
i'll tell you right now out of these
three the spider's the best play
you needed to fill a roster space
turtle turtle turtle snail you mother
no no no no this peacock's going [ __ ]
wild man are you kidding me
we drop we draw we draw these we draw
these
big big plays big plays
dodomi
we don't need garlic quite yet it
doesn't apply to any of these units
although if we wanted to roll a quick
little blowfish
sell me
buy me
garlic me salad me
it's a bit of a weird turn taking too
long to get set up here but it's
something
you're uh
as a dolphin if that was a mosquito i
would have been upset but if that's a
dolphin that's fine life goes on
heavy blowfish energy
it's do that dude the blowfish it's it's
all about value are you seeing the hit
that dolphin
mother if it hit if it hit the dolphin
we come out of that with a draw but it
is
bro you roll penguins on this
pill me
penguin me
for the time being this is a big penguin
big penguin meta
big big penguin meta freeze me
yeah yeah okay even if we lose this
round
we got we got big plays for the future
this is a it's a spawn build
which would have been very nice to have
our our blowfish popping out of control
but life goes on i suppose or whatever
you're a piece man you're you're a piece
okay we we really we gotta bust out like
five wins straight here
big rolls
no no no no no
freeze me this is a just in case freeze
me roll me
no no no no no
we need we need we need more
freeze me just in case
pop em pop that goose man pop dick
it's all right they're they're they're
full of garbage after you get through
that build they're full of garbage
no they're not not garbage enough
game craft 24 7.
well monkey dodo build wow so cool one
win pay out the doubters



slash marker
sap
one
all right we're gonna move to the to the
pay to win uh builds
we got sick of the free to place it
happens
here's my impression of the free to play
build um horse horse horse horse horse
monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey
monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey the
end okay
customize animals like people i get it
you know
it's the uh the irony of this game is
that you know the sheep are played by
people but the people are sheep
the the they've hit the left they don't
like to experiment anymore they don't
like to feed free winds they would
rather just farm dopamine by
restarting the game over and over until
they get five fish in their first shop
now we're popping i don't mind an early
beetle
i don't mind two early beetles with a
fish alongside this squad does not lose
it draws maybe
the low-key
shovels this is the first time i've ever
thought about restarting the game um
just because the names were not that
good
holy crap it lost
[Laughter]
if it that was a 50 50 on their ant
though i can't be too upset
eat shop food give animals plus one
health you know what we can do then you
know what we can do here
freeze me
roll me
eat me
buy me
buy me
yeah yeah this is this is much better
it's a level two ant are you insane
i will become back my money
the the gamers have gotten too good
it's it's just insanity
freeze me
roll me this is what we wanted to see
because then
that's not really what we wanted to see
but this can get us
this can get us out of here a little bit
because we can buy on you
to then at least our chick gets a little
stronger just a little but but that's
that's something man that's something
we have an 11 12 beetle up at the front
it's all falling apart right here
please please
please
what happened man
it's crazy
roll me
we need if we live once more we get
garlic armor we're in a good spot okay
we're go like this is not an o4 build
that's what's
more than anything else that's what's
driving me to uh
salt here
this is like a good squad
obviously it's not that good
or we wouldn't be in this position but
like the it's it's insanity
the the amount of uh
of metal lords we're going up against is
like it's on a level heretofore never
seen before we we get that's a winless
run are you are you insane
how does such a thing happen
that you get a a winless run with a team
like that
you gotta you just gotta take a breath
after that
how does it happen
you just just
let the acetylcholine slip away
i understand what we got going on okay
there's there's two things i'm gonna do
the first one i'm gonna do
is a metal straw all tilt is gone
that's good stuff okay
the first thing i'm gonna say is
read between the lines to all the people
who told me you always put your
strongest unit at the front
maybe that isn't the uh
maybe that isn't the reason that we're
getting bodied but uh and it's
certainly has not improved our uh
success so far um the other thing is we
need we need to go to the uh developers
and say
developers we got a
we got to introduce
a ranked
mode that also leads to punishments for
abandoning games
that's the thing
i'm not do we need to go to the
developers developers developers
developers developers developers
developers
we we need to
have if you want to play casual whatever
if we need a ranked mode where if you
abandon a game in the ranked mode
you get kicked out of the queue for
five minutes that's it something like
that would would help out a lot
because i i feel like we're running into
like
some uh
some surprisingly difficult teams here
how many people actually do this i'm
gonna a hundred percent minus me
i'm the only honorable player
literally no one does it source dude i
don't watch richard hammer at 1am uh
pacific time
monday through sunday on twitch.tv slash
dick underscore hammer
dub cricket's a little spicy but
it'll be the hooting hipsters
juice me
this is it's a loss that's gonna be a
four hp fish
we're gonna do three hp total but that's
okay
this squad is not the best round one
squad you're ever going to see
now you can roll a beetle
because it's a 2 3
you can roll two beetles because they're
two threes
we need you to do something and you know
what just i'll put you up at the front
and hope for the best
double ant means this is probably a loss
but the beavers are our future scaling
so maybe we'll get maybe we'll get a
little lucky here actually
we we draw these but it was close
we really need to level this turn
i think you can spend
that's good
that's
good i think we can roll an early dog
and then roll
give me a six six okay
i must i'm a sick six i like a quick six
shrimp scampi
shrimp scampi
give me the 2 4 with upside
shrimp scampi
okay
we got a little tankiness
shrimp dog has has some place we we win
on the first one we win on the second
one we lose on the third one but okay
trade with the ants
dogs getting the smallest of all
possible buffs we lose this one surprise
surprise it happens but that wasn't too
bad
we have two hp left
we really would like to roll a flamingo
here so i think to make that work you
sell a cricket
lovely buff you feed your beetle
and then you get a nice little 4-3
flamingo out there that buffs the dog
that's not that bad
then you
don't forget about me
we pill a flamingo even though we just
made it stronger to get a permanent plus
one plus one and then
we roll the second shrimp
no we freeze the shrimp we roll the
second ant
pill it next time now we got a four six
dog just out there chilling
two one two one you loved it eight eight
one blowfish at the back
more than a moderate degree of spice
we lose by one hp
it's been known to happen
pill me pill me okay
all is not lost yet
it's close
kill an ant
buff our dromedary
suboptimal
nobody can understand what the lobster
does i don't why would you when it what
does it mean
in the sentence
friend summoned give it plus two plus
two when not in battle
so lobster buffs
other creatures that are summoned in the
shop
okay i understand
so if we had a lobster the lobster cans
units when you buy them
okay i now now i understand
i mean it's really hard for me to dump a
dromedary here
the other hand it's really hard for me
to not
sell me by me sell me
sell me
okay now
a lot of people
gonna take issue with this
probably should have rolled once
it wouldn't have changed things but
we can now combine next turn okay so
you're gonna you're gonna hook me up
like this please for the love of god
for the love of god
no horse means we get through that we
get through the rams and then we get
absolutely freaking shellacked by the
fish at the back
it can't be done man like that what
happened
we pay out the doubters once more we run
it back
i mean winless is is just staggering
that's that's eight straight losses
since our last win
freeze me a cricket just you know if
you're gonna freeze a cricket let's buy
a cricket
it's all right it's a really good shot
uh for me to poop on um
i mean of this
uh i guess you put a you'll put a damn
pig at the back
no you want a cricket at the back cause
you're gonna buff it long term but like
this is
holy crap man
i'll be uh untouched mouth
holy bursh
it's
it's not a surprise this was pretty much
expected
you know let's build a big marty okay
freeze me you can fit there that's you
know what pairs are important let's do
that instead
the real crallian
thanks for the gifted subscription in my
time of need
it didn't kill my my cricket
pain
pain we lose by one yet again pain
okay but this is
this is where it's all coming together
you peace
tropical fish okay
you gotta you gotta use your noggin a
little bit
don't really wanna put it between two
pigs
um
i would say
you combine pigs
you buy a dog
freeze meat roll me
freeze me place a tropical fish down
here
as a result we get a little buff on the
dog the dog's getting buffed by the bird
this is a reasonable team
nothing has been killed
they are simply better they simply match
up better in all circumstances but holy
crap we gotta draw
they said it couldn't be done
they said it couldn't be done
now
now we're freaking talking
for the time being
sell me
place me
by me
we can roll this squad
for a minute okay
yes
roll me
you must take a bat a bat must be taken
which means
you must
dump the fish or the bird
i would be inclined
hello
what's up
do you want to see the update sure
so we have daycare
situation to take a look at today
yo it looks like she's having an okay
time
oh she's crying a little oh oh no
you know
that's okay
she's been crying a lot what is this
baby is this doll is like it looks like
the doll from toy story that's on like
the spider's body
it's like a it's a bald baby doll that
has like black eyeliner on it it's like
black lips yeah oh my god
it looks like she's she's a little
independent there oh my god that's
something your photo makes my heart dude
okay
i think you sell the bluebird
so that you can get a buff on both the
bat and the dog
roll me
probably just bat me
you're not going to be long for this
world you're called freeze me
meet i people always want to go meet on
the chick because it's a one one yeah it
sucks but like
i would rather put meat on a unit that's
likely to get more than one hit out of
it instead of just making i would rather
have a useless one one and then if if
like a bat for example can hit twice
with them with the meat then that's a
big win i i think
if you're gonna run anything on the
chick you have to run a steak on the
chick
but we got a long way to go for that
okay this cricket
we're loving what we see here out of
this cricket man like look oh my god
he's he's gone
nuclear he's on x games mode
this we finally got a win holy crap
it has happened
we need some form of scaling
i would be very much okay
with dumping the dog early
to replace it with a puppy
and then buying you
and then ending turn with excess gold
okay
now
if we could just get
golden poop you peace
i'm playing as slow here
hey you know what our bat kills the fish
i think we lose this one but we lose no
oh you have meat on you as well you
mudder
it's okay golden poop means you're
running against the tough squad we ran
we ran into like the bat didn't have
what we wanted it to hit life goes on
okay puppy scales better
rooster's nice but we gotta relax for a
moment
um
i understand the concept of replacing a
rooster with a
cricket with the rooster now let's think
about this if we dump a
cricket
we get
a an eight eight rooster with garlic
armor that will spawn an eight one on
death this appeals to me
we'll probably give it garlic armor
i would say for now
a level two bat
and and maybe freeze me and hold that
garlic armor for the next turn now we
got
now we got some maybe garlic on the
puppy instead
please
the fish okay the swan is good thank you
thank you for hitting the swan
our bat will kill their fish do we have
any chance you know what as long as our
dog
gets to hit the swan we draw
that's fine
we're still pulling something out here
hit me
roll me
to be honest with you i my new situation
my new meta as we get rid of you is
you never want to level the f the chick
unless you get a shop that goes like
crazy instead
you just keep it as a five-five and then
you sell it at some point
you don't level it up unless you can get
it insanely early now the fish
we need to replace it with something
i think at this point we could sell a
fish hold on everyone chill out i know i
just said we shouldn't do this
i thought we could do that too but we're
gonna be slightly short on gold
freeze me roll me
freeze me
roll me
three four two three four
not a great poodle build but
okay we we take the poodle
we take the seal we hit the fish at the
back that's that's draw technology
and we draw again
okay well we got the shop we were
looking for
i want you to know i'm only doing this
because it gives me plus two plus two on
our bison as well
otherwise he'd be out of here
and we're still freezing garlic
batok please
now the the rooster is not going to be
as good for a bit but
micro build
it's
anti-bat synergy i don't know how this
is going to work
to be honest
i feel like we win because you don't
have turtles holy crap we gotta win
bit of a surprise thanks for the buff
you're probably gonna need this first
roll me
freeze me we'll figure out where to
place you in the future we can always
put a bat at the front that's not a big
deal
i don't know chili no because we're
chili might work well for now
we can at least we can look at that as a
for now that's big plays
cow
you could sell the chick buy a cow you
get enough buffs out of that that i
think yeah okay
we got to find a way out of the scaling
pit we're in right now because we're
about to run into some nightmare teams
this looks not that unreasonable for me
no turtle
4-4 owl you peace
you peace whatever you peace we draw
you are the nightmare team no i don't
think so i i
were that true i would wish but
um
moomi
that's fine we i know we were saving
that for a hundred years but whatever
moomin
bat me
roll me
puppy me but not yet
now i i think you got to rework the
squad man
even that like
let's try this
level one turtle
still bad cancels our weakness kills our
puppy this is a loss there there's no
way you're pulling out of this one
unless no because
you peace
well we at least we got two wins like we
started to get out of that a little bit
more
maybe we're getting a little bit of mojo
back
run me back again
it's a bad starting shop
but you know maybe the time has come for
us to do this
it's about as good as it gets
these squeaky ice cubes that's a real
thing that happens
holy
we draw but just barely
oh my god
we gotta go for a pair an ant is still
very nice
freeze me
yeah free and a plus one plus one is not
that good but
you gotta do what you gotta do
i think to be honest i would rather put
another two three on the board out here
two three on the board right now on most
likely to succeed
ladybug three four is pretty solid we
should unfreeze that
holy
you know what though i don't i don't
fear that much when i see a 7-4 fish or
a 7-3 look at that
one big unit loses to a good squad
okay
this is good this is good
because
we can buy food
buff you
buff you buff everything in the shop
pill and ants
makes you better you got better buy a
swan
swan me
this is not gonna be
people's favorite move but i'm going to
sell a fish
to make the space
to hold a bat for example turns out is
actually the greatest move you could
ever ask for
something like this
yummy yummy yummy i've got bats in my
tummy and i feel like biting you
scary squad lots of ants
the the enemy that has
the most hp
getting the weakness is a dream come
true holy crap we have two wins here
it's happening maybe
terrible shop
roll me
still really bad
um
i think we're we're going to be looking
at dumping a bluebird
is it 2-1 i'm not really interested in
investing to get it further ahead
um i think you would sell me
roll me
now we're talking now we're talking
call me crazy here buy me
pill me turtle me turtle me turtle me
that's that's really good that's really
good
play me
bad me
don't freeze me
but
buff me you're most likely to stick
around buff me
well the bats most likely just well you
buff on yeah okay buff the bet because
you still
yeah that's fine it's fine
it's good it's good
11 10 beetle
with some bats
we can okay that's not what i wanted to
weaken but that's okay the dirty rat
didn't even get summoned are you seeing
this we just went like we had a four for
one trade to start
pretty solid that's a win that's a win
we're building something
we will work on our upgraded swan for
the moments
the next thing to leave
will be our 6'5 green beetle because we
want are we on turn turn five a red
beetle a bat or a swan would really hit
the spot right now
okay
we are going to sell our green beetle
it's early enough we're at three wins
you want to roll a caterpillar here
we'll move our swan to the front
we will roll once more
red beetle also known as a ladybug
apparently sure uh yeah um so we want to
freeze you
by you
roll once
freeze you
we're in a great spot this this is some
good stuff
red beetle dude i'm not good with bugs
i'm more of an etymologist than an
entomologist
this this squad is the dream like i
don't i don't even know what's happening
here it's just it's going wild
we're going to get another level up next
turn too this is obviously amazing
obviously really good
uh i i think at this point you could
sell a
red beetle also known as a ladybug
and buy a worm and just start feeding
that son of a gun
thus to make your caterpillar stronger
long term
sell me
buy me
salad me salad me salad me joy
whatever
okay
bat and swan are doing a lot of work for
the time being
this is bad level two turtle is is
mighty bad for us here
but you know what we still trade with
the blowfish no we do better than trade
in fact we we do much better than trade
are you seeing this man we're freaking
popping
moo
moomi
this is
it's not tough you need to sell the
chick
it's so nice for our swan but the late
game means you need this worm to pop and
we can't sell anything else so the
chicks gotta go
you buy me
you buy me
you're gonna sell me
i'm just not sure what we're gonna roll
there
okay that's fine we're not gonna you
tabby cat we want regular cat if
possible bison's not really the squad i
think you can definitely can me here
you need to freeze me
i guess you would go rabid and then a
salad
didn't hit our worm but you know what
the the double salad on that was still
pretty good
our rabbit's not gonna do too much but
you know it's the thought that counts
losing the chick is gonna be a temporary
backslide but it's gonna help us
long-term golden poop holy crap golden
poop holy birch
our worm lives our swan lives
melon armor is going to be a kick in the
pants so that's fine that's that's a
strong team that's a strong team
this is important
this is important
i wouldn't suggest that we need a second
rabbit like we're not i don't know well
you know
no i don't what freeze me roll
me getting you oh you know what okay so
we'll make you pop next turn we'll
unfreeze you we'll freeze you we'll roll
this is good some garlic on this worm
will go a long way
and then caterpillar will be level three
next turn is very good stuff sell the
rabbit get a turtle
level one bat
it's not that bad
our worm getting hit is pretty bad but
whatever what are you going to do cry
about it
honestly you're at peace we don't sweat
that believers are coming
we need
coming through not you know
in their pants just hear me out okay we
can also roll we could we could roll a
hatching chick again just fine it
wouldn't even be a problem
leopard we sleep you roll a hatching
chick up here
on the worm to make your caterpillar
that much better
move you front of the line
this is a roll me
and for once we want more food for worms
because it's good
i think you roll past the apple it's
just not good enough
okay show me buy me
use me
use me
sell me
freeze me roll me
tortolmi
tor told me
oh
that's what we want to see
now this is the squad of dreams
wow nice buffs hey do you have anybody
on your team that can face my worm
or are you just gonna you know what get
soul load
just like the box office in march 2017
get soloed
okay we don't feed a seal so we say no
to this we go yeah we go yeah
honestly honestly if i'm being honest we
go yeah
this is possible there's possible plays
here
but i think i would rather roll
and search for some great stuff you know
what we freeze a cow because we're gonna
no pilling a turtle is not good here
at some point we can dump a swan to feed
our worm more freeze freeze me
sell me i'm sorry swan the time has come
okay
then you're gonna milk me then you're
gonna milk me greg fonker
we're not pilling a turtle well you know
hear me out here
garlic armor is good now but to pill a
turtle in front of the worm replace the
garlic armor not too bad we can at least
keep it up as an option we can keep it
as an option
garlic falls off somewhat quickly
two caterpillars actually a genius idea
i wish i froze them
on the other hand eat this
eat this nice melon armor too bad you
die anyway eat this our war the rest of
the squad has been completely
insulated
from what we've what they've had to deal
with so far this is crazy the worm is
the only thing that matters now
are you seeing this
roll me
we love a good melon honest the most
important unit in the game is melon
armor
straight up straight up i was like
chili's
we
we actually need another caterpillar
like
i i wish i'd saved it man i wish i had
saved it but but so be it keep that
melon around for the future
as long as they don't weaken my worm
which we should expect to happen quite
consistently in the future
we should be okay a little smack little
smack little smack congratulations you
made it past my first unit
sell me
buy me
we lose our melon armor whatever we want
who are we going to put her on the bat i
don't think so roll me we'll get one
back don't worry about it roll me
pizzami yo ho
oh
now we're freaking talk give me a stake
on our tortell okay okay okay
if the front line doesn't have melon
armor that looks good that looks good to
me
we got you
we got you okay congratulations
congratulations
you managed to uh you managed to kill my
worm congratulations
now you get to face my butterfly
four three three five two
i mean
like a poodle beats a cow right now we
can start to think about the future
there
it's not a ton but it's something
we're on nine wins we got a little room
to work with too you know what give me a
little
yummy yummy yummy i've got pizza in my
tummy
so you're gonna buff buff
buff
no buff
we accept that though because you have
to have turtle in front of caterpillar
no buff but you don't need a buff you
don't need it
honestly as as busted as it looks we're
gonna melon
our bat
you never know it could get you out of a
jam seemed like the best use of our
of our technology in my epi this is for
10 right here man
okay you busted my melon armor that's
that's a big play congrats to you or
whatever 1010 bus my turtle lived
two friends get melon armor lived anyway
smoked you anyway killed you anyway
thanks for the 10 wins
believers
we were waiting a long time
we were waiting a long time for that one
and yet
it has been done what was that two
losses finally
good god i you know what it was
glass of water
early worm early caterpillar did great
stuff okay
they said it couldn't be done
the rumors of super auto pet's demise
are greatly exaggerated
keep me on
pay to win for now we've been we've been
running it down here you need an ants
you roll me
red beetles
will be the
oh i mean come on
two sweetest words in the english
language
this is a loss
in all likelihood but we accept that
it is but only by one only buy one
you like a fish
then you roll me
this is not good
you roll a fish at the back bird at the
front
and a quick little buff we're gonna
apply this buff to the fish and we're
gonna get a nice two two three two
two four on all of our beetles
which are actually ladybugs
this squad's not too bad
evaluate
we we beat this squad
excuse me they're they're trying to take
down the servers
i i dare not say the words lest the
caption be interpreted interpreted as a
my sequel commands
we draw these
you're trying to do it my sequel
injection you piece
can i you know what would be nice if you
gave me a squad of like duplicates at
any point
i thought they died did that not look
like they were about to die
will take a swan
you're probably gonna combine me five
six up at the front
we don't sweat that we're gonna put a
swan at the back
this squad honestly
give me a hedgehog at the back
buff the crap out of this guy with a
little meaty
this is how we do it we we can't afford
to take up to pick up a second loss
early here we got to do what we got to
do to stay alive
we certainly are not sweating this right
now
so far so good this is a win
dr octopus the naughty eruptions
we need pears man i know we got
mosquitoes that's a that's a big
investment though i thought this was the
same unit i got very excited
would you give me one of this why don't
you give me one of this and while we
swing for the fences
you peace um you know what i'm so
confident in how we did in our last
round
sell me a hedgehog put me a flamingo up
at the front with a little pill and pass
me a bottle mr jones okay there's your
squad
we're just hoping for a draw we should
have had the flamingo buff the fish but
we're a draw would be acceptable
we're gonna win actually okay
very nice very nice
you gotta be very careful with the order
here
a fish is
likely to stick around for the time
being
and our ladybug's already popping so the
bird is going to be one of our early
cells so we will
you know what buff the swan
kill me pill me
lovely we love a bet we buy the bad
first so that
it gets plus plus now the poodle is like
the most valuable unit you could ever
ask for here early on
one one one two two you need to get a
poodle going
dude you might even be able to roll like
a late game owl
in order to get this off the ground as
soon as possible
i think you
you're gonna end up selling a fish
that's a given
to get to six gold you know you want a
poodle
two one one two two him me him him me
you know you're gonna keep a bat long
term so we might as well buff the bat
which means the swan is not long for
this world but might be valuable for the
time being let's be realistic
one who's who's getting buffed you're
getting buffed right now this is this is
fine
realistically we do not want to roll
this owl so instead let's be smart
knowing you're not long for this world
but you are
let's put some garlic on you as as bad
as this looks i think it's the best use
of our current resources we could have
gone garlic on red a beetle to replace
the meat and i think long term that
might do some good stuff but for now i
take these
hey shadow insurgent thank you
the gifted subscriptions
why not on swan swan will not be long
for this world because we're going to be
using
our bat for buffs instead the swan and
the bat have a conflicting tier we must
get rid of it and roll a stronger level
three
uh instead
two four two one one we're also going to
get rid of probably
our bird but
blowfish getting plus one plus one every
turn
that beats sheep imo i think i think it
beats sheep okay so sell me
buy me we're looking for because we have
a a one
a two two twos
a three and a four the next thing we
need is a tier five next turn which
would be
the whole
game plan
right now is
if you
reroll whatever you have to [ __ ]
reroll to get to a red ladybug if you
get a if you spend nine but you get a
red ladybug in the shop
life is good or you could try to level
these up as well
then next turn we play the red ladybug
that unlocks tier five units for us any
tier five works well because it'll start
our scaling with the poodle we want to
see poodles red beetles poodles red
beetles
freeze me
we want to see
duplicate
versions
of our existing units that are not red
ladybugs you're a piece roll me
you're a piece roll me salad me
oh baby
we don't we don't want to be this is a
this is a good depth roll
you could roll puppy instead of blowfish
but we're going to be spending a lot of
gold i don't uh we don't we don't take
this the swan's not along for this world
don't worry
you peace
not a piece not a we can roll this for
temporary purposes in case we lose this
next round this the the mission was
accomplished the mission was even if we
lose this round the mission was
accomplished okay
nice try
oops
oops
we win again
four wins one loss okay
now
swear it all comes crashing down
play me
sell me
buy me
garlic me
pretty much got a roll here
we need poodles
no no no no no no no no
no no no no
now we need to level these units
you're going to reduce my hp nobody
cares you have a 14-6 hatching chick
like how does such a thing even come to
pass this one goes out to the person in
chat who said his rhino ever worked oops
uh how about
you're my you're my tier three
honestly we could sell a blowfish and
roll a hatching chick that makes our
rhino even better because the blowfish
it just exists right now
sell me
buff me
buff me
roll me
garlic is gonna work really well on more
units but i think more will show up
later as well
that's fine it's fine
oh look at that
shrimp scampi
i don't think so
i don't think so
it's spicy
we're getting we're getting a little
we're getting some good uh
bad luck right now no doubt about that
this looks pretty good this looks pretty
good
might be a draw
that's fine that's a draw but that's
fine
for once we're actually scaling instead
of merely pretending to scale so
sushi's fine no you know what freeze the
sushi and fish for a re-roll cause that
level two poodle is like
so important
or you know what a level two bat and a
freaking level two get that sushi out of
your garbage your garbage
you know i know what you're thinking and
i'm also thinking it too
could we maybe dump a ladybug to get an
octopus going like freaking crazy here
in the future i think it's definitely
possible i think it's definitely and
maybe we then think about a can because
it carries buffs with it um
yeah okay
oops we're scaling
i've been a little anti-octopus lately
but i think this is uh
this is the exception that proves the
rule
i don't know what that means but it
always sounds nice
oops hey by the way pay out the
believers
you need to scale the poodle like this
this is the most important by far
no no no no no no
hear me out here okay octopus is good
it's an 8-8
however
the the gorilla's main weakness
is that his hp is low which makes it
difficult for the coconut shield to pop
however
when he scales at plus two plus two with
the added benefit of the chick every
turn
he gets a superior melon armor i think
if he can get to
i don't even know like if he can get to
30 hp
then he can't be killed by a 50 attack
unit regardless melon armor is different
melon is different
because it it only blocks 20. so i think
you
sell me i hate i hate to see you go but
i love to watch you leave sell me sell
me
can me
buy me this is a bit of a weird squad
here but work with me
unfreeze me
cry know me
send me
i believe in this squad
his coconut gun shoots in spurts
if it hits it's gonna hurt you're nasty
you're nasty man
that's
honestly we ran into a nightmare squad
they're scaling like incredibly with
their t-rex here so that's
to the victor go the spoils that's what
we in the business call fair play
i see it i see it okay i see it
do we really do we want to trade
temporary five five for yeah we you know
what we got the life to do it
i believe in you i still believe in you
at the front and the rhino one behind
maybe i'm mistaken
we're really looking for another level
rhino but take take your hp for now it's
a nice buff you're a piece
we can't roll you and roll the gorilla
are we pot committed
are we pot committed
i think we're pot committed i i think at
this point we're not we're not bailing
out
on the other hand
could replace poodle
it's
i'm not look
i'm sure you're a good person you're
probably just under a lot of stress
right now okay
we're definitely not getting rid of our
poodle that's just
this is just an asinine idea
i i
you could get rid of the chick
there's a
freeze me for this turn okay because
we're not gonna be able to get the buff
either way
we're not gonna be able to get the buff
either way so we might as well freeze
you
and then i think we roll for um sure
something like a can
not really sold on a stake here just yet
but
and then a second t-rex is quite a
delightful situation um
and focus your buff on the rhino instead
knowing well are we going to sell a
chick are we going to sell a gorilla
we're gonna sell the chick to scale the
gorilla faster so let's buff the gorilla
even though it cannibalizes one of the
buffs from the poodle the t-rex doesn't
exist to do good things for itself it
exists to kill the enemy
or to let your other units kill the
enemy i should say
it's a strong marty right there
i said that's a nasty team
now this is a this is a big moment but
this is a sell me we're at 12.
you can buy me
buy me
buy me
n turn but i just need to make sure is
this the way we want our squad outlayed
maybe yes maybe no maybe we'll try
something like this
end turn confirm we get a beautiful
assortment of buffs here
very interesting oh let's go that
changes everything
we break your melon armor our gorilla is
not gonna live but that's okay
we're gonna trade and then we're gonna
kill you here which means we get to
seven wins and that was our that was our
spicy round
it's hard for me to imagine
that um
we get to another level of poodle but i
guess we're gonna
we're gonna freeze because we're the the
only thing i really wanna see is melon
armor for gorilla
and rhino for that matter
i really don't see us getting a bat
going
it's tough
this is a tough one
we're going pretty deep
i don't see any melons
i see a melon very important even more
important than the poodle this is well
worth it in my opinion
nice buffs
level three turtle is a is a damn
disaster
oh but we break your melon armor okay
little coconut shield shoots in spurts
we make it out okay okay
seven wins
level two rhino
level three t-rex
roll me one time
and turn
the scaling is is doing some good stuff
it's doing some good stuff
chili peppers it's gonna break so oh no
no it's not maybe the weakness is not
amazing of course as you can see for
yourself but hey look at that turtle's
dead it's a level two turtle their own
gorilla is going to be a real pain in
the butt here
works two times works two times doesn't
matter does it matter does it matter
there's another win for us
play me
freeze me roll me poodle poodle
i mean you get you gotta
we play to win the game
buff me buff me
nine wins please
weak in the front yes
double turtle's kind of annoying but i
mean maybe not that big of a deal
thanks for the coconut shield it shoots
in spurts
you're gonna get me you're gonna get me
but we were close
nine wins is a big believer play
choose outcome
there we go we're doing some good stuff
today
oh
and then
slash marker sap two



you know we're doing one more session
here then we'll do two hours of
inscription to finish it off today will
we get six wins or more we did it we had
a lot of zeros don't get me wrong we had
a lot of zeros
two but that's kind of like a lot
keep in mind like the game has gotten a
lot harder
as people have figured it out hello
victor by the way hello
you can roll a fish
you can roll a cricket in free to play
you can think about
rolling a duck
if we're not combining for a minute
this is a tough one
welcome to the party pal
naughty hands
bad start
maybe not that bad this this squad
doesn't look terrible it's a draw
no it's a loss okay it looks bad
you'd really like to see a horse going
alongside this you need to invest in a
pair
you roll me you invest in
a triplicate
um
and then honestly i was gonna say buy an
apple but you're way better off creating
a cool cricket and then hopefully
buffing something with your otter that's
exactly what we wanted to see
this should be okay maybe a draw
double ant is a is a damn nightmare of
course but
it is what it is
it's a loss for sure
just look at the math like it's a 5 4.
you see ants it is what it is you know
you got ants we got crickets we know how
that works out
but this is where it starts to come to
pass
freeze me
roll me
sell me
by
me grab me
meet me
i respect it roll me don't freeze me
you're a 3-3 beaver i sleep i sleep i
sleep on this i sleep on this i i drink
your milkshake er early crab is a little
gracie a 4 7 is it is very tough to deal
with in the early game oh no my otter
owns okay
you're simply owns
all of a sudden we got a one-two out
there it doesn't do a great job of
owning you but this early crab uh oh
uh-oh uh-oh
one win
i have no idea oh it simply does not
upgrade when leveling so there you go
um this is a little stinky this is a
roll situation
we definitely would like to get rid of
you
and put a flamingo out here instead
i think we would also like to get rid of
you put a swan out here instead
and then roll me
and then roll me we would like to freeze
a pill for our future
it's pretty bad
this is just like not a good
situation the shops are a little stinky
we don't have a we have okay stats we
don't have good meta defining yet
um
not too scared about this kangaroo we i
think we match up quite nicely against
them
you're a piece we we actually don't
match up that nicely against them
never mind we match up beautifully
against them
badger huh
okay some some
units we've already seen is what you
like to see do me a favor buff me a swan
probably garlic mia swan
roll me something another flamingo works
fantastically thank you so much for your
service put you here
we'd rather have garlic in the future on
our whale as well so we're on we're on
one win two losses this is really where
we gotta get started
level two horse plus ram is uh is pretty
nasty
pretty dirty
it's nice that we trade with their fish
we do knock out the first ram
they're gonna be four fours or four twos
i should say it's not bad we get a nice
triple kill here i don't see how the
horse gets to our cricket it's got to
get through our swan first this is a
nice win here
spicy crab man spicy crab
i would really like to peel you rather
than sell you so this cricket can go
i wish to have an ox on the squad
for now
i wish to freeze a turtle i think is one
of the best units in the game let's
unfreeze garlic to maximize pill
opportunities
i will do this
i will roll you pill opportunity
achieved how much ever
dude this is kind of nutty right this
guy's spitting out a level two turtle
for now
i think
hear me out here
this is the dream pill
because you also get the guaranteed
melon armor on the ox
then we will have you eat a tortilla
and then we'll freeze you roll you
holy birch holy brush oh man oh
okay okay
this is good stuff
this is good
owens
we trade with the peacock i'm a very
happy man
kangaroo um see you later whale at the
back huh what's going on there
i just got here have the believers won
any games who's gonna tell them
okay so thinking man's endeavor
um
we love this
you have to it's it's
you have to
so we um
sell a crab
keep the swan for the time being still
like an ox
you plus three plus three on summon
the turkey pivot is is is mighty nice
keep you around for the time being
hit me
salad me keep me around i want you to
keep me around well i will well i will
because i do want to get a pill for some
melon armor in the future
even if it compromises i mean it's
already compromising the meat but that's
totally fine because melon armor is uh
amazing and meat merely exists
quick little level two never heard
anybody here
okay fair enough
quick little melon armor
we're not going to well we are going to
live through that we're not going to
kill you though but then we got a little
melon armor and then you die
that's four wins
straight up the way you play this game
in in my world
we would like look a buff on the ox is
good
but we want a turtle to give melon armor
to our turkey because we want to protect
it from snipes
then
we wish to place a rooster
in front of our
whale
which when it dies will spit out a level
2 rooster which is great for the rooster
is good for the turkey it's good for the
ox
and what's good for the ox is good for
the gander
um this is a roll me
we certainly can try to get a level
three rooster coming and you know what
take a little slice of that the swan is
likely not long for this world
you spit out
just a simple nine four okay that's
that's a nasty worm i see what you're
doing with this worm and i will admit i
respect it by the way your worm is dead
now we get two chicks at the same time
little twelve five oops you're dead
uh oops you're not killing me
big sheesh energy there turkey
disgusting five wins five wins five wins
five wins
you re you can it look okay this is you
gotta think this one through
monkey's great
penguin's great if you can get them to
level twos the thing is
i think you gotta roll
the monkey but the problem is it mostly
buffs the rooster which is kind of
stinky the penguin would buff the whale
and you'd be hoping that you'd be
getting your ox going soon too
the swan's not long for this world you
know it's going to look like this you
know it's going to look like this and
then either you or you is existing the
problem is the monkey buffing the
rooster is simply not that good it's
okay
i think you freeze a whale you roll a
penguin it looks really bad right now
i mean there's
some stuff to like here
i think there's a dude we're so close to
the levels i i think there's a very
realistic chance you rolled past turkey
it's co do you don't care didn't ask
plus you rolled past is my mistake okay
it's my mistake
don't you do it
we still win these source dude just
trust me
you're so lucky i don't even know if you
understand how lucky you are whatever we
won anyway
so that's believers win
it's the fastest the shop has ever
loaded in
no no get out of my face this is the
squad
roll me once
buy me we're so freaking close to
buffing other units
yummy yummy
okay i see some scary buffs here
did we get you do we get you we we don't
get you it's okay we got you
guys quick little you know what gotcha
hey guess what guess what we gotcha no
no it's okay it's okay because guess
what
we got you and then you nice nice uh
nice rams by the way
we gotcha
we gotcha we got you now do we gotcha
we draw you
i'll live with that i'll live with the
eudraya now we need level twos asap this
is like my favorite type of build
because as soon as we get these level
twos like literally all we have to do is
hit enter
okay so
you can
remove the meat for some garlic it'll
scale better in the late game give me
some level twos you piece
bro the tiger
you ever run into this situation where
like the tiger kind of pisses you off
just cause like
you don't know what to replace it with
i mean i i feel like tiger turkey for
now is okay
and then
freeze me just i didn't even freeze you
man what was i thinking
you can roll a steak penguin
tiger always pisses me off
i hear you man i can't disagree but like
you know it's gonna do quite the number
on your hippo here
it's gonna do quite the number on your
flamingo was this squad like supposed to
do anything like was it supposed to like
run the risk of not uh losing to me
easily like
there we go there's seven wins we really
need some level ups here man
the one up doesn't work well really on
anything
you could throw it on the tiger as like
snipe protection it doesn't work well on
the rooster because it
replaces a seven well actually replaces
like uh
13 no it replaces uh
19
13 with a
13 13.
uh yeah i think this this is a roll for
units and a roll for for chocolate
for sure it's so important to get okay
that's great stuff
the most important scale that could
happen here
i mean you're gonna laugh we want to get
the level two for the buff but we also
wanna um
i mean the whale spitting out a level
three turtle would be hilarious
or do you sell the penguin the role of
fly
i guess you don't need scaling
here's the thing normally i struggle
with this decision but our penguin is
already like a useless unit so having a
uh
having a fly involved
makes a lot of sense
and then we don't have to worry so much
about the scaling we could just have the
whale spit out a level three when it
dies
admittedly the placement is going to be
a little messed up
i still want the double turkey we don't
want double fly so which means the fly
pretty much has to go here
we would like you to have some form of
protection in the future we don't really
need you to spit out a level three
because we don't have the space for it
right now
what we would do is freeze roll once
we don't get anything that works for us
right now
we'll level up the turkey instead
another fly sure why not who's who says
no
this is a squad this is a squad
get eaten
they've got a very similar build but
where we have a
a turkey they have a horse
but they do have a level two fly uh it
doesn't matter
i well i don't know maybe it matters
let's see maybe i'm wrong
these are some strong units though like
look at this
they haven't even cracked into our
rooster yet they crack into our rooster
nice four four fly oh six four my bad
well we got some 30 14 so uh
that's bad luck for you
level 2 fly spits out the flies as a 4 4
instead of a
instead of a 2 2 which i think is
largely irrelevant for us but
look okay a level two rooster actually
does very little for us
and i'll tell you why okay just walk
through it with me before you start
shouting
hello
okay
oh look
she's doing okay
she's a little grumpy but
look she's eating something
she's eating she's okay that's from
earlier she's doing okay
that's that's better than i thought
honestly it seems like she she didn't
cry all afternoon
like she cried and on and off on and off
that's not so bad
it's not so bad
it's like in digestion
you're gonna be fine i'm sure
okay i do think the fly
works well here
i do think
the fly works well here
that's a little look i wouldn't expect
you to understand how this works
we
uh
i mean obviously did we did we kill it
yeah so we could get that sick turkey
buff
i wouldn't really expect you to
understand how it goes and then you move
it to the back line that's that's a
little play we call that a belgian dip
i'm i'm gonna level you any oh
we could add a level two not that it's a
huge matter but
oh man
wait is the same squad
it's a shark is a little scarier than
than though than the horse build that
they had last time but we still kill the
bus i mean this is going to be this is
going to be hot let's put it that way
that shark is gonna be mighty strong
we're still on our second unit i don't
even know where they're at i feel like
they're on like their their third unit
we're killing the fly killing the fly is
an important part of the the process
here
which then lets us kill a turkey then we
get two beautiful
uh little lady birds that come out here
look at that easy win
i mean it's not that big of a deal
but a level two is better you know an
extra two hp it hit the spot
peel the fly again
the thought it dawned on me
it's
it's workable
i mean you this is the squad like i
don't know
you you could probably build a better
squad i don't totally know how but
i'm sure it's theoretically possible but
if you run against this squad like you
know you're in trouble
i mean like nice coconut shield just
kidding and all that
you're really you're relying on a
kangaroo to get you there
you hate to see it
i mean we didn't even
we didn't run into like any problems at
all
okay that's a good one for me because
that's a 10-win marty free-to-play and
we have been suffering a lot on the
free-to-play decks so you know what we
pay out the believers
we start our predictions back up we go
to play arena you can roll this you this
is a squad you can roll okay you can
roll a horse early
you can buy a cricket you can freeze a
mosquito just in case
you can roll a second mosquito
or a mosquito i should say then freeze
this for the future
the one time we get piggies
i really like the slippery seeds man
no ants is bad i probably would have i i
let's just restart the build it's busted
front line you peace
this is a loss
if mosquito hits the front line i don't
know we might make it out of that but
yeah the lion a emote i mean that's it's
just a top tier emote there's nothing
more that needs to be said it's it's the
damn dream
you're gonna roll me once
honestly like you peace
sell me freeze me roll me
freeze me holy bursh
three three threes and a cricket with a
horse at the back is a squad this is a
squad that can work
this is a squad that can work you
owns owns
a simple
owns will suffice get owned
they're only going to be two threes now
but
now we like we like the squad okay we
like this squad what do you do if you
like a squad
you put a flamingo up here
beautiful buff that's a beautiful buff
you got to roll a sheep with this bill
this is it's insane
thank you
i would sell a cricket believe it or not
to throw one more fish in here
gets a nice buff right at the start
b is good too
everyone knows everyone knows b is good
and that's exactly what you're [ __ ]
looking for okay okay okay
because what you do here
you're gonna
holy [ __ ]
you're gonna you're gonna pill me
with the horse and the sheep in the in
the play then
you're
gonna i don't i haven't thought it
through yet okay you're going to
then
you have space
you're gonna buy a dodo then you're
gonna buy two fish
that takes you to zero so we're gonna
have a four squad marty next time okay
but that's gonna give the dodo plus one
plus one then when we combine the fish
it's gonna give the dodo plus two plus
two
in addition to the plus one plus one
that i got earlier so it's actually
going to be it's going when i wake up
you know i'm going to be i'm going to be
a 46 dodo on your squad
yaya yaya
squad me squad me roll me
how about you sell the horse next time
how about you be
more transparent about what bet you made
doubter
my man swallowing a duck
really yeah so that's so it's a way to
play don't get me wrong this this
kangaroo is a little spooky okay
but we come out of this with a juicy
draw
which is very good because this is where
things freaking pop man
you need a sheep involved
or a horse involved
we're gonna we're gonna kill you
we're gonna buy you
we're gonna combine you
we will freeze you you work very well
with the dodo in the future
and then we're gonna i'm not gonna wait
wait maybe i should wait
we can wait one turn
what am i doing with this we could wait
one turn
to buff the giraffe with a plus two plus
two as well
yeah yeah yeah this is fine this is fine
so we'll roll it like this it's the
squad of dreams
it's the squad of dreams
well just a simple nine seven fish at
the front oh you're dead
oh you peace you'd be math
you think you're so cool with your maths
i think we draw no because you have a b
at the end you peace
oh we draw thank god okay okay okay
now here's the play
something's got to go
um
and honestly it's probably the horse the
time the summon build is is at its end
okay
so you buy a giraffe
you then do the combination of the
century
although i'm like you know what hold on
hold on the front door roll me once
if we can get a better unit that's a
freeze
like an ox for example an ox is pretty
good
an ox is pretty good we can sell the
sheep
buy an ox
combine me
okay okay
it's tough for me
to figure out
how we're gonna make this worm work but
it is really early for a worm
but without like a caterpillar or
something it's tough for me to imagine
how we get here
you know i am a believer in um
running a four squad build and laughing
about it i'm not taking a worm i i don't
see it
i don't see it being the squad
i do see a camel perhaps being part of
the squad
and i do see a level two dodo being part
of a squad here
i i love i love a four squad marty man
oops i lived
okay melon armor congrats you got mal
and armor congratulations this looks
like a draw
this looks like a a win easily by the
way
four squad marty wins again we all knew
that was coming
um
you're probably gonna double me
dude you you roll a monkey you buff the
crap out of the fish you win the game
unfreeze me roll me
roll me
i mean run me
oh
man
dodo first yeah that seems like a good
idea
oops
okay
squad of the century's doing good stuff
we need three wins
roll me
yes buff me
the scaling is a little slow on the fish
that's what i'll say but
who needs scaling on the fish when you
can just buy cans
and freeze a can and then buy a can next
turn as well
oh my god
23 14 fish with garlic armor
dude you know what i realize oh this is
a little nasty because of the melon
armor but you know what i realized is
like people very much disrespect stats
people really out here like the fish is
the only weak link
look just because it doesn't have like
okay okay we got you just cause it
doesn't have good flavor text it's still
gonna hit like a damn truck
you know what this scales our giraffe
nicely
freeze me roll me
you definitely
it's interesting because you could you
know what
i think we like the super scaling here
stick with this squad for now
but freeze a penguin
sell a monkey and we're going we're
going wide we're going wide as heck man
and then freeze me
get that ox out of there the the ox
is going bye-bye
the ox is going bye-bye
little splash damage never hurt anybody
source
dude just watch me
sell me
buy me
buy me if you're gonna do it just do it
roll me
can me because we're gonna get something
to replace the ox and these things are
looking mighty juicy that's a freeze me
you're not relevant you're not an
intellectual the cans are turning some
seriously sick units out here
ox is a little spooky go ahead oh you
sniped my penguin i'm so scared just
kidding
dude we kill you through oh we almost
kill you through the melon armor
all right
you win this time believers ain't that
the truth
would like to roll a hippo on this build
it's already 10 13.
it could use some garlic
holy birch it's already getting buffed
now freeze me roll me
freeze me holy bursh
oh my god
dude this one we're running wild i love
the croc snipe on our useless unit it
feels so damn good
yummy yummy yummy yummy
the scaling is out of control and we're
winning early which means you know we're
not drawing as much which is great news
it's great news
many people are saying this roll me
double chocolate all the way across the
sky
it's tough because you can get your dodo
to level three
it's for the
best then you roll i mean honestly if
you want to be cheeky no because that
takes stats away from the fish
yeah you just roll like that that's fine
you still you're still spitting it
forward the dodo's not getting buffed as
much but it's still getting
buffed by the penguin
these are some scary units now give me
some melon armors
oops
oops
i mean i don't know what you want me to
say
the the fact that people are out here
you know backseating on the build right
now and they're going like here's what
you should do it just has me being like
a have you lost your mind
i can roll this for now like are you
watching this squad
we just right click and it's we win
that's it
we're just clicking animals yeah just
click heads forehead
sell everything and buy honey
i think it would be fun to like get to
nine wins and then sell everything and
just roll like a single snail or
something like that
just just give someone a free victory
this is weird
oh tough luck
i mean i don't even think you need the
pears man i think you're you're really
looking for a next level penguin more
than anything else
tiger dodo is sadly irrelevant
because we're already
very close to the cap
tiger hippo is kind of interesting
i'm not sold though i i really just
think we need melon on our hippo and
then we're off to the races
melon on the fish would be nice as well
let's start with melon uh let's start
with melanoma fish
this is a really good setup
this is not good for the enemy team this
kills the enemy team
oh that's a strong dodo though hold on
hold on
we ended up getting a loss there
i'm a little surprised
but you know what it just
you can't always rely on just getting
free wins
i suppose we'll give you one of those
suppose we'll not give you one of those
suppose we'll roll you you know i've
heard tell a story of an animal that
lives in the frozen north
frozen
frozen south
an animal that lives in the frozen south
can buff all level twos and beyond
yet it does not appear it appears to
only be the stuff of legends
this is looking pretty good
all right
well
good wins
give me a choose outcome yes i'm gonna
use the bathroom but i'm not gonna throw
a slash marker in here just enjoy
yourself some music and i'll be right
back he's bald he's bald he's bald
do
hello gamers
sorry i'm just eating some uh
madeline's madeline's
you know the the the baked good
that's delicious
that's delicious
are they baked good
look
they're pretty good
but
they're a little stale that's not the
bakery's fault i bought them two days
ago
they staled out a little bit
what the heck i'm on top of my dang
headphone cord man
i apologize
we love the youtube
very cool very swag i like it
okay we just thought we have half of a
madeleine
one more
opinions about school party sugar
cookies with icing
you know what i appreciate the banter
attempt
white sugar cookies pink icing
i kind of like them
i like that because the
the the icing gets like kind of cold and
crispy
the the actual cookie itself
could take it or leave it but usually
what you buy it at a bake sale 25 cents
a pop i don't mind them
dude i so i was part of a bake sale for
a club in my uh middle school
my mom made peanut butter cookies they
don't look that impressive they taste
delicious you know it's just a brown
circle with like a fork imprint in it
because you you
push them down with a fork in order to
flatten them to the baking pan and then
they get a nice texture on them as well
people were kind of just like oh
peanut butter cookies i sleep i sleep oh
look at this one it's got a maraschino
cherry on it or whatever you know what i
did
i hid a loonie
under one there were 36 cookies i think
i hit a loonie
under one of the cookies
and then i started saying like hey it's
25 cents a cookie but one of the cookies
has a loonie underneath it and i gotta
tell ya
it they started flying off the shelves
they were people were like oh i'll take
four oh sorry you didn't get it
that's when i realized people love
gambling anyway hold on let's um
how much money you raise i don't know
like no joke let's start the predictions
here
no joke um
the teacher for whom i ran that was why
i didn't run it i was part of the bake
sale um later got fired from my public
school for embezzling
the funds that were supposed to be used
for
you know like school or charity based
purposes he used to run the the pizza
orders we should have known man we were
paying in sixth grade we were paying two
bucks a slice
for pizza in the year 1999 2000. come on
that doesn't even make any damn sense
i did those slices would be like seven
bucks now it dudes i can't believe it
i walk down the street in vancouver now
i see places that are like you know two
slices for four bucks i'm like those are
two thousands prices anyway sorry sorry
sorry you
pig
build we don't like it unless
unless we get piggies on our name tag
this is a horrible start
we're investing in a cell meta
i want you to know we are like puppies
i want you to know
we're likely to lose our first two
rounds
just be our running noses would have
been sick you're not wrong okay
that same teacher by the way okay
you gotta invest in success
it's a ya
it's a yacht
it's a yaw and then it's a full sell
university
you can't keep them all you know what
you don't need the freezer pig you can
freeze these two instead okay that same
teacher by the way i was me and a friend
of mine were elected president and vice
president of the class
um
it keep in mind just for the record
it was sixth grade
i missed or we both missed a meeting of
the school like class presidents
because we were sick
and the next day the teacher had an
impeachment trial
of whether or not we should be removed
from office because we missed a meeting
and they did in front of the whole class
of like 30 kids you know kids right like
they're like well they made a mistake
they should face punishment so we got
impeached for for being sick
it's just like the the dude was just
insane
anyway
start me here thank you okay now now we
can we can start to believe okay now we
can start to believe because this is
going to sell for four takes us to 14.
so we love we don't want to sell yet
hold on
i said hold on
you're going to buy me
giraffe you're going to buy me
we're gonna do a sell me
freeze me
roll me
roll me
you're a piece
run me
this will work this will work
just don't die if we all like have four
fish if we draw that's okay
let's go let's go we win we win
big plays now
this duck's got to go this duck is going
bye-bye
but i don't think is it really hold on
okay you know
believers i'm sorry do you trust me
sell me
buy me
sell me
76 badger
six four flamingo kind of be smacking

you're you're gonna laugh you're gonna
laugh probably your your ass off
freeze me what we are gonna try to do is
pill a turtle
and then roll a badger at the front
obviously we wouldn't mind seeing a
whale
or something similar
at some point
you know
i've never been afraid to roll a four
squad marty
okay maybe not this time maybe
in this case just buy me roll me
don't do that oh i'm doing it
prepare yourself it's happening freeze

gonna be my thing i'm just gonna be the
man who loses because he spends all his
gold rolling
oh too bad about your kangaroo
that one goes out to all the people who
were like why put your badger in the
front

look at what they sacrifice to get a
fraction of our ingenuity
we're not gonna get any tier threes
okay
that's not going to happen
roll me
buff me
roll me
oh my god
sell me i know i know it's weird uh it's
weird but hear me out here juice me

it dies it's going to do 11 damage to
them
but not to me
oh
my
god
we should dodo it too well no because we
need to have the melon armor there to do
something
by the way sorry about your kangaroo
oops
you're a piece you're lucky but you're a
piece
anyway it's going bye-bye
can me
roll me
[Laughter]
this this is not the play it's not the
play
it's not this on the other hand
is that's the play of the century
this is a neat build thank you i that's
what i aspire to is the neat builds oh
no my monkey
oh you're dead oh you're dead oh you're
dead guess what you're dead
dude it's kind of it's kind of pog
it's kind of pog
buff badger who would have thought
when he gets to the bottom he goes back
to the top of the ride then he gets to
the stop and he goes for a slide and he
gets to the bottom and he sees you again
uh yeah yeah yeah yeah we gotta we the
fish has got to go in favor of like a
hippo
at some point we're gonna need
like some function
i'm imagining at least for now though
just can me
freeze me it's great on the badger
great on the dodo dodo hits the freaking
badger ooh
oh in the hippo now we're talking man
yeah we got to be careful we don't want
the badger to go over 20 because then it
will cancel our melon armor
oh not cancel but it'll go over top of
it this is uh
you know what it's a strong dog but once
you get past that dog like the squad
just falls apart
that's five wins
easiest dodo of my life
i gotta be honest with you i think we
start here
you go to
no we start stay here stay here don't
not on you on you
yummy yummy
at this point you could sell a monkey to
double the dodo with a with a parrot
however
that ruins our long-term scaling
but that's okay
in some ways this guy's got to go at
some point when we can get melon armor
on somebody else
you know what that's not a bad idea what
about a what about selling a monkey
next turn
i i can't make a turkey build work here
what we can do is be content with the
level two dodo
cat
run a worm and scale the crap out of the
worm
we need melon armor to
no are you insane
honestly for now
why don't you go hard
forget the dodo i'm i'm loving the dodo
man don't worry about the level two dodo
is fine
the way we're running this build level
two dodo is gonna work
oops
oops
oh no my monkey
you're dead
on the other hand
i lived would you look at that believers
get pla get paid out
another meme build in the books
look for this to take over the meta
sometime soon
sell me
we're running out of things
we're gonna keep a dodo
for now because we're gonna sell a hippo
i know i know okay we're gonna roll a
worm
we're gonna roll two foods uh two foods
yummy yummy we're gonna buff you we're
gonna about fear
you're a piece now we got a real problem
hold on let me run the mathematics here
okay because
the badger is going to do 31 on death
which is
enough to kill my flamingo so we have to
roll it like that
at the very least we're giving people at
six wins a build they've probably never
seen before
that's fun
you peace
my melon armor
my worm
you're a piece all right that went badly
i would like to see we have how much hp
won
that's not a lot
it's a big
garlic works pretty well on you too just
honestly
but you get a nice little scale there
don't get me wrong but i think we're
gonna we're gonna hit you with garlic
okay
then
worm me
pair me
probably we need th
mushroom worm can revine revive yeah
a one one
um
one of flamingo's kind of interesting
yeah
i still believe in the squad man
no no dear no dear what
badger v badger
we lost to a superior badger build would
you believe that either way one two
three four five six that's a believer
payout
dude where i love to see
a minority of believers get paid out
badger's part of the new meta confirmed
roll me
look i wish the order were different but
it but it weren't
this is an okay squad
with the hooden hooden hedges we the
hood and hedges
didn't run bets this time hold on
that's where you're wrong
don't shoot horse an ant
still bad
this is a loss
high quality mosquito
bad
very good
very good indeed
roll me roll me
i mean buy me buy me
follow me
with a little bee
it's not that bad it hurts our b that's
it
life goes on
easiest win in my life we got a 4-3 fish
doing nothing back there
now this is the thinking man's maneuver
we don't go duck there's some temptation
but we don't go duck we do this now you
think about it for a second do we like
these units not really
um
so we invest in our future
we get a nice ox works very well behind
an ant early on starts as a 2-4
none of these appeal to me at all roll
me once
you can roll for the time being
uh you you can pill an ants
buffs a horse buffs our ox
dare i say we're gonna roll a 2 1 b out
there for for the time being
and then
but a simple spider
we're fishing for okay that's a freeze
we're fishing for another pill no pill
that's still i like this squad man i
like the squad
no b unfortunately is just uh
it only scales on stats so it's it's
very funny that it exists
nice snail thanks so much i really
appreciate it um but it doesn't do
anything beyond that they have a level
two dodo already that's so funny
that we somehow still won um
so i don't mind selling a bee
this allows us to temporarily consider
running two horses
then you can roll me
because this is not good but in order to
capture some yield
i am going to improve
my oxen
i understand now what must be done
um i will
purchase
a horse
freeze a fish just in case as it just in
case me
this seems like a good round
you should start the betting at seven
wins
someone
was not here earlier in the stream and
it shows
we we had a we had a bit of a rough
start to today's stream we had we had
multiple winless uh
runs
you're so
unbelievably lucky
the the non-stop rams
saved you and it was the only thing that
could what
okay um this is insane uh so we love
this
then
everybody relax okay
the next step is this
freeze me
freeze me
i don't care for a giraffe a deer out
there
like
pill me
combine me
pill me
dear me combine me whale me
this is you always take just in case
unfreeze me to maximize pill chances
garlic's good but but oh my god a 12-17
turtle me
every time
at least we trade with the dog the
kangaroo's gonna ruin our life
well
it's not as bad as it could have been
that's a nasty squad this is why you
have the snail though
so we without a pill we have to make an
executive decision this is our executive
decision you get sold
you get bought hmm
yes this i understand the the wariness
but this works
though it looks
strange you're going to buy me and
combine me
it's a really early hippo
i think you accept this horse is not
something you're looking
at long term
um
and the fish will be sold soon as well
you know what take one of these just in
case it helps um
we're going to be getting rid of our
horse in order to roll
hopefully
a monkey
or some form of scaling
it's just merely a small pivot what an
interesting situation we have here very
similar looking squad i can't help but
notice
a little lucky
what can you say man it's just rams all
day either way we win easily
three wins
i think you can can
you
know you know
i think here you sell a horse for
certain
in order to get a bison poppin
the placement is kind of weird
pear is okay
oh not great but okay
okay okay okay okay now we're not
rolling a worm
sand it
it's just just a squad of
somewhat large lads early
selfish for bison
does anybody in class recognize why this
is not the best idea on the planet
anybody bueller
easy win
yeah that's correct the fish is our
level three
which is the thing that allows our bison
to scale in the first place that's very
good
now this hippo is not scaling
but let's change that freeze me just in
case
a pill is great if we want to replace
something
because
it's really good it just doesn't quite
fit
rooster
you know okay
you pill the deer
in front of the ox
thank you so much you sell back a bus
you buy a rooster
which will give you a couple of triggers
on this ox for now
is this the believer win or we i think
we're one away
big whoop
yummy yummy
this is looking pretty good
it's looking pretty good
decent play
one is the believer win
tough to roll rhino here
tough to roll any of this
sometimes you gotta roll it's just it's
though it's the way of the world
if anything we're gonna want this hippo
to pop at some point man like
you please you'll peace
it's it's hard well you know what the
hippo is a big play
um but it's hard to figure out
where this monkey fits
like you replace
bison if you replace bison you lose a
lot of scaling just to scale a chicken
if you replace fish the bison no longer
scales you might as well have gotten rid
of the bison
if you sack the hippo i mean it's
already level two i think it's doing
great stuff i i think this is a team
you can believe in right here and and
you can roll for
chocolate in the future
and you know yeah you're not a bad idea
we can start to roll hippo at the front
although you tend to run into the
enemy's strongest units at the front
which i mean this is just a loss you
just embrace it um
well i don't know actually
it's actually a win holy crap
believers get paid out
okay now we roll
hippo at the front
um because we need space for the
roosters
buff me
i'm going plus 90 on my first bet ever
you know what i love this i always love
to see the believers be rewarded
i don't know if we're getting past six
but
we're certainly not getting past it on
this one
the scaling is just is kind of slow
that's our problem but if we can stick
in there it's still kind of early
you kind of need this
sell hippo i don't think i will
i don't think i will
i recognize the danger of us being kind
of locked right now
tiger hippo
like here's the flow chart it's hard to
tease it apart it's like a knot in your
uh shoelaces okay
we you think oh we want the tiger to be
good or we want the hippo to be good
maybe we could sell fish say 1717 bison
for now is okay put tiger behind hippo
but if the hippo gets killed in one hit
then it dies okay well we can't really
disrupt what we got going on here tiger
bison
you know it's not worth plus two plus
two to take up one extra space here you
can roll tiger rooster at the back line
but then you don't get the extra
triggers on the aux which has been
actually doing great work for us right
now like the problem we have right now
is everything is
important but nothing
is dispensable
but the squad is not scaling fast enough
to get us there so in true isaac fashion
i think we should
consider
a pivot if things are nightmarish so the
first thing you sell is the fish
you prepare for the bison to be
sold next turn
we attempt a cheeky little
tiger rooster that summons four chicks
at the same time
i'm going to be honest
if we're going to do it we do it now you
sell here
you sell your bison
to roll a monkey to make your hippo
stronger
it's very scary this is
not unscary
we really need
like to run against the white weenie
build here
we got luckier than expected i would say
didn't quite kill there
that's gonna kill us anyway all right
here's the moment of truth
[Laughter]
we win
that takes us to seven okay that was a
bit of a gamble
to say the least
melon's still better here
i think you do can
okay
the problem is that a fly does nothing
for us
it summons a bunch of tutus that do
nothing
without a turkey it's it's
straight garbage here
um
it's a really bad shop
so
we're gonna double salad and pray for
the best
we were kind of you know in a rough spot
there
smell and armor of course melon armor
as long as we're trading it's not that
bad
uh it's not that good
holy crap we win again
you gotta sell
it's tough man it's like you can sell
the
the monkey and roll the turkey but then
the tiger when
yeah no because you need the tiger to
buff the rooster the the turkey to buff
the roosters you only summon three
instead of four but they are much better
so i think what you do is
sell me
now this is this is advanced level
techniques
buy me
milk me
milk me
sell me
freeze me
roll me
i was looking for some milk man
you can't i mean i guess no you can't
you can't the shark is too much it
doesn't fit right buy me
mailing me it's pretty good
roll me
freeze me
roll me
i'm still somewhat skeptical
please tell me oh we're not we're not
quite enough
okay here's the moment of truth
we draw
no
okay i forgot about the tiger all right
dude still one two three four five six
seven eight eight wins is pretty good
that's pretty good
dude we we had some serious believer
builds at the end there choose outcome
we will
all right we needed the three-hour
window there to to learn how to play the
game in this new meta where if you don't
have uh
excuse me did i did i hit log out
i don't want to log out of this game
this is like it i want to remember this
computer



hello to all gamers welcome back to
super auto pets sorry i uh there was no
video yesterday
for super auto pets put me on the free
to play build please i've been just like
super busy i i recorded yesterday's
isaac episode like 8 p.m i got to be up
at like seven to drop the baby off at
daycare it's getting like it's it's
getting a little tight but we're we're
working our way through it
i like this shop i did play some super
auto pets in bed last night and uh i i
got some 10 wins okay
at least one i i had oh that's that's
even better honestly um
this this is a dream start
you know what let's be the hilly turtles
the turtles kind of have a hill when you
think about it a shell but the shell is
a little hilly
um not that spooky
you know it
not not that spooky of the slightest
honestly
looks like we're coming through this
with a win early the community has
gotten really good we we need to find a
way to stay ahead and it's it's not that
easy
so the way i would choose to play this
okay
you
if you want to roll a duck and it's
debatable whether or not you do you want
to be able to sell it to upgrade the
unit that you get when you get the fish
to level two however you also
need to get the fish to level two to get
that unit and it gives plus one plus one
to everything that you have you don't
really want to give that to a duck so
these are kind of like
um
slightly incompatible i think unless i'm
missing something
you can absolutely
um this is it's a
it's a little bit of a tougher situation
here
you don't need the horse yet because the
horse doesn't give you
uh a buff it would buff the horse it's
not like if you popped it here um but we
don't have any like on death triggers
we're really using the horse as like a
fake
apple more or less like every unit we
summon gets a little stronger i think
for now we'd be better off tossing like
another fish in here four four fish that
could be a six five pretty spicy pretty
annoying
and really like oh this is a nasty team
man although that's okay
the dream for we win this man the dream
for fish is that you actually get to
level two fish to level two and then
combine the level twos to a level three
so you get a whole bunch of uh of
upgrade triggers
so
um
we want a peacock
early on it can help us out honestly we
don't care for a horse anymore so as as
weird as this looks just trust me for a
second we buy the peacock the
combination allows the peacock to become
a 2-6
very valuable an ox totally works
and i honestly think
we kind of want to pill
the ant in front of the ox and then like
a spider in front of an ox can be a
great play so i think we freeze the
spider roll we got a pill
peel the ants in front of the ox i know
we could also combine the fish but
as previously mentioned there's like
some interesting plays that you can do
there that would
make us you know more likely to succeed
i think i'm okay with our layout here
this is a nasty squad a big
chunk of our success depends on what the
spider summons
which is why we're going to keep it slow
we want to see some turtles snail is uh
with giraffe is the worst what you want
to see you want to see turtles you want
to see rams
or sheep i should say really anything
that has the chance to generate some
upside
um
this is a win though like
the fish are doing it for us they won't
do it forever so we would like to see
the payoff as soon as possible
up to three wins already
if there's not going to be a payoff asap
then you can definitely roll this i
think you freeze a dodo for future
purposes like if we can get a fish to
level two it pops nicely swan is a nice
temporary play
this is not really a great situation
i think you roll a cupcake on your
peacock
i don't know why that sounds so dirty
we're looking for garlic as well but hey
man anything to get some extra wins i i
have now like gone full circle thanks
for the snail by the way uh i've gone
full circle on uh
on four
marty squads now when i see a squad of
four i actually get like scared
we if we don't get a snail we got a much
better chance to win that but
i'm like there's a reason they're
running for and it's not gonna be good
for me
okay so the time has come
we the spider does not need to exist we
could run something else in front of it
but i do like the double trigger i think
we need to consider at this point
rolling
sell the swan it gave us a body it gave
us one gold maybe it didn't work out
completely but it is what it is with 14
gold you buy
a dodo
uh and a giraffe
it's a little slow
garlic will do nicely here
nobody else really needs it uh
a whale is is like one of the most fun
units to play with
we can
because like in my head i'm like well
let's freeze a giraffe
so that we can play the
the giraffe though it doesn't scale deep
it scales wide it gives wide scaling
which is not that valuable for us
actually
so as much as i would love to buff the
dodo and and i really would
i think this is a strange but necessary
kind of pivot here
to have the a double spider trigger
which gives us a better chance to get
not a snail in the future i'm not
sweating this honestly like i think you
could possibly roll a sheep here as well
this squad is lost right now but if we
can just get leveled up quickly on some
of these like the peacock leveling up to
give us uh a chance to get a meta
defining unit holy crap like you're i'm
i'm not that upset like i'll get over it
um but the the sheer amount of snails
that we've gotten is is kind of
staggering
it's it's a little absurd
hey at least they got some garbage too
right like
we're very lucky but we're still gonna
lose
so this this team is falling off pretty
quick we're 3-2
we're gonna save the peacock for one
round
so that we can skip one extra tier of
units
which might be
non-advisable
we're not going to care so much about
the spider
um
you know it's weird but i think we can
pill the spider
if you could just roll a snail in front
are you kidding me man no no you can
sell the snail that you just got and
then roll another spider in front so we
at least got the extra ox trigger
this would be a nice one to draw or win
because next turn we have like a little
bit of accelerative
scaling coming in
okay it's a snail okay sure sure of
course it's a snail why wouldn't it be a
snail thanks you kid because of the way
that works you just straight up kill my
ox
we get a giraffe that does nothing for
us
i fully believe that this is rng but
it's a little surprising on stream
yesterday we also got many many snails
um
okay crocodile
seven damage to the last enemy this
squad is not working
so what do we do
the spider like to be honest with you
the ox kind of
blows and the dodo kind of blows but the
dodo has like future scaling the spider
also kind of blows i think you sell the
spider first if we have to roll a whale
at the front then we then we do more
likely we'll be able to find like
something
to roll that is uh
well in the future at least a little bit
more advantageous
i'm gonna blow your mind i think you
sell your peacock
i and it's bold don't get me wrong but i
think you need some form of scaling to
possibly make this work and please god
have the crocodile snipe something
valuable a one-two penguin
not what we're looking for
things fell apart here but you know i i
always want you to keep in mind they
fell apart um because of the fact that
like it got tough it wasn't like out of
nowhere i was like let's just you know
toss this run to the wolves
we we were like we had to make a bit of
a hail mary because things were going
bad
like i got guns to my head i think i'm
going down i can't believe it's
happening in my hometown
you can roll an ants i like i think you
can do a can just for future purposes
we're really fishing for a dodo
like i hate to say it but we
we're running into a serious issue which
is like we haven't built it's turn eight
we have no level twos that's a real
problem for us so i mean this is it it
happens you know you you get yourself in
oh i lived
you get yourself into a position where
you're like uh you know you start to
lose and then you think to yourself like
how am i gonna get out of this
the way that you get out of it is um
man we're so lucky with the math here
the way that you get out of it oh never
mind we're a little unlucky with the
math actually is you you got to pivot
but the pivot makes you more likely to
lose your next round because you are you
know liquidating the investments that
you had earlier that's fine it's not
that bad we went 4-4
we respect this you freeze a mosquito
you're looking for ants with no ants a
double mosquito build imo this this is a
turn one drawable
be the naughty naughty fireman
who owns this fire
poop poop hat is pretty good
we draw i what did i tell you i i've got
a sixth sense now
for for when a squad is uh is
a win or a draw early horse
plus anything especially fish and ants
is is wins early
starting to come around to this idea
right here um
you know
this is a risk i'm taking a risk for
slight future scaling forgive me
this looks
this looks like something this looks
like a draw
no
caesar no okay whatever though fish fish
me fish me you peace fish me i'm not i'm
not taking another duck so you can
you can stuff your saris in a sack roll
me plea we need to roll we we need we
need a a squad we need a squad okay this
is a sell me
by me
because the swan is good enough
then
buff me
keep that pill frozen
i think you're gonna roll a a camel
swan
i like this and then we're gonna kill
the ant next turn a camel can do it man
a camel can i mean five is not a ton of
hp but we're going up against some white
weenies here
we don't sweat it too much as a level
one horse this swan is gonna ball
out of control
it's gonna be like a an 8 11 swan
no it's gonna be a seven seven swan
whatever we still got there
okay this squad has some good stats and
stats are very valuable
we're gonna kill you
that's fine we can we can roll this fish
a little longer i don't mind taking a
little investment here
um
these are all pretty bad to be honest
but we can roll meat
on our swan
and just to be honest with you let's
combine let's get a let's get a 2 2
which is not that much worse than a 2 3
and then we'll get a plus zero plus one
on two uh two of our animals next turn
but we we needed kind of a better turn
there
in order to feel happy and things are
absolutely falling apart that being said
they have a level three fish on like
turn four so they have had
three fish
and they've had six fish in four turns
so this is pretty
look you can't plan for that you just
sometimes there's a little shop luck
involved and they took advantage of it
that's not you know they didn't do
anything wrong
we can roll a temporary flamingo
garlic on our camel does well
we can roll a camel like semi long term
i think that's a double freeze and a
roll regardless even though the roll is
compromised um we we could unfreeze the
pill but a level two flamingo
in the hopes that we get a whale or
something in the future it can do some
stuff for us
we gotta dump this mosquito by the way
like before we think about getting rid
of our uh
our flamingo we gotta dump this level
one mosquito
i have not even been paying attention to
the idea that maybe there could have
been another mosquito that showed up so
dude swan is
making quick work of dz freezy that's
for sure
no need for the snail
we're on turn six turn six to me says
you don't
uh
upgrade your flamingo you wait a turn
and i don't think we need the pill
anymore i think that this at level two
will actually be like an okay body
um it doesn't need garlic maybe the fish
could use garlic for a bit
i'm just trying to figure out what i
would want to dump a 4-5 mosquito for
and none of these fit the bill
um
i think you can temporarily roll a
giraffe
it's
basically you're buying it for like a
plus one in the future
i'm thinking okay i mean the other thing
you could do
if you're gonna roll this for a bit like
we could make a semi-permanent
investment i don't actually like putting
meat on the low hp units because you get
more uses out of it typically on the
high hp units but it is something like
it's it's a mathematical improvement
lots of lots of triggers happening here
we lived as long as we killed a kangaroo
in one that's that's the meatiness
very cl dude but because we if we sold
the mosquito we might not have had the
stats to make that happen now you can't
really like cherry pick like that but
it is what it is i mean i'm not
certainly not upset okay i don't think
seal is what we want but
so be it
uh you know what though hold on
at least okay now
hold the front door
um we could start to with two hp could
we start to rebuild into a sort of
turkey build
it's gonna have to be a slow pivot
but i think we can get there
i mean that's very important we need
something here
kangaroo does very well with this build
as well by the way but
i think we're
the the turkey build can scale out of
control let's
think about in oh this is a that melon
armor is gonna blow me away man
what do we need on this squad in order
in order to pop well first off we're on
one hp so like life is hell um
we need
sheep
tiger
any of these really rooster
whale plus deer really whale plus
flamingo would do some good work as well
i think we can afford to
sell you
for now buy a cow
invest in the camel
sell the sell you
something to be said about getting the
hippo out here early i wouldn't wouldn't
dispute that but hold on
like this then a quick little sell me
and uh for now it frees me and enroll me
cricket has some great plays but i think
for the time being we're gonna need this
we're not gonna roll a qriket long term
so like let's not cry about it please
don't lose here the scaling is here
you
peace
it just needs a little support man
it just needs a little support
i see the squad okay but our our fish
can do this we really want to hit that
level three fish too okay great stuff
great stuff
please replace some of these units with
units oh
level three fish okay okay
it has to happen
i don't mind keeping the camel for now
i think you i think you send it right
away send it send it
now a leopard
doesn't fit our squad's vision of the
future
i think we like this for now we're going
to want to replace with melon at some
point we want a whale now the fish is
great okay
this is a scary moment because i don't
really want to eat the flamingo
and take it off the off the map here
that being said eating a flamingo
will generate some buffs
then when it gets re-summoned it'll be a
7-5-7-4 flamingo that will also generate
some buffs i mean this could lose us the
game
would anybody like to
tell me what i did wrong there
you're not we were supposed to sell the
fish
to get the
to eat the flamingo um
alas
we didn't um
freeze me
maybe there's something better to eat
not really uh that's a good freeze
though okay um
it's not the smartest idea i ever had
are we gonna are we gonna pay are we
gonna pay the piper are we gonna get
some nasty hippo scaling i don't know
you turtle on turtle you peace
you peace
there's a nice buff
melon armor
still smacking
still smirking
still smacking
still smacking we're still smacking
okay
okay
things are getting spooky
do we need chocolate
give me chocolate
admittedly i think you at this point
like the flamingo did some work but we
got to say bye bye we got to take a
turtle we got to freeze you
the melon armor is much more valuable
that
the turkey
because we can get there right now i
think we do the turkey
dude honestly there's something to be
said about like gorilla coconut shield
but
i i just just a little more just a
little juice
don't kill me leopard
did not kill my turtle which is it
didn't really matter that much i suppose
okay now that's a nasty level two turtle
i i see that we got a real great minds
think alike type situation here this is
we're going to lose i think you should
prepare yourself for that inevitability
we were not off by much
okay we
let's run it back two four wins that's
not bad but we can do better okay
you can freeze a mosquito here i i
recognize sometimes like and i i
recognize that this sounds salty but
sometimes people will say things that
are like
hey you know when you freeze something
in the shop
the slippery submarines it means that
your next re-roll has a lower expected
yield of exactly what you want yeah it's
it's called a hedge you know
you know when you buy a diversified
basket of global equities it means that
you know you have less potential upside
than if you went all in on the next
amazon um but you know i'm just i'm
saying that maybe that would be oh maybe
it would be okay to get an average
result with a little bit of guaranteed
yield instead of uh you know thinking
that i'm smarter than everybody else
that's invested in the market whether
super auto pets or otherwise
this is a good situation
um
i think
rather than buy an apple
the best play
is maybe that
uh we get a better chance to get to a
level two next turn it still gives us
plus one plus one it's just on the
cricket instead of on a unit of our
choice we still got two mosquitoes
actually it might have helped out a
great deal
good trades this looks like a win it is
absolutely wasn't even close to a loss
look at that so we're up 2-0 already
strong early game it it matters not
because you scale when you win but
because the more hp you have when you
get in the late game and run against
like those monster teams the the happier
you're going to be
you can run a 3-5 elephant but it's
somewhat unimpressive i think this is
more along the lines of what we need so
let's start here
a blowfish is pretty good
you can
even though you lose the value to some
extent here you can combine
do this
freeze a pill to use on the ant in the
future or
i mean to be honest you could sell a
level one fish
for one
this is a bit of a weird play but work
with me buy a spider and pill it to get
an early tear
i'm losing it man we just spent four on
a snail with no upside on the other hand
keep in mind it could have been
another blowfish could have been uh
giraffe would have been pretty cool
could have been a turtle um but it
wasn't so alas
that's where we find ourselves now
we're very lucky it actually didn't
matter and we get look we spend four on
a snail but we do get to sell the snail
back for one
i think we freeze you so that we get a
another super level up next time
pill you for
maximum blowfish chance
i've come to terms with the fact i think
you have to you know be a little less
picky here um
funny
we gotta roll a little heavy
okay this is good actually
i've come to terms with the fact um
you can't i i don't think you can really
build a 10-win run around a blowfish
unless you start scaling the crap out of
it early
but you know we'll give it a try for the
time being again now i get very scared
everybody knows
let's go
that a you need to have a squad of uh
five to have a good chance right so when
you run up against the squad of four
it's some freaky stuff is going down
and usually it means that they're not a
newbie anymore usually it means they got
some new tech
so hit me
it's a pretty bad roll um
but that's okay
uh we're gonna garlic you it's it's very
valuable
you can laugh at this all you want but i
think that's the play
i'm not look the mosquito's not long for
this world the cricket is not long for
this world the peacock is going to be
combined i think you can choose to see
that in in one of two ways right
one way you can see that is um
you know we don't have any like
permanent uh members on our staff yet
this is a loss for sure but the other
way you can choose to see it is that we
have a lot of space to run good units
when they show up instead of having to
be like you know we we can't afford to
sell anything
so um we'll we'll run a combine here for
sure i think a sheep is a is a beautiful
unit
one of the best tier threes
you can i think we could dump a cricket
at this technically it's a five six
technically you know what maybe we'll
sell a mosquito first
and are we gonna roll
if we're gonna roll a giraffe even just
for temporary buffs
let's get it going early so that we can
then get that buff on it with the snail
as well
we really want garlic on our peacock but
it's a bit of a hard sell i'm just going
to be honest turn six a little late for
a swan
very happy running a second snail here
for for some nice buffs
um
maybe freeze a turtle
a turtle to buff uh our peacock with
melon armor is is gonna be potentially
kind of nice all right there's another
freaky squad here we got a whale at the
front i've been known to do it myself so
i
i
respect it
coming looking pretty strong here
i i don't see how this could be a loss
very nice this takes it's already our
best run five wins
i find myself thinking it's a little
late for a dodo
it's like a must run but i don't see us
leveling it up in time
um
unfortunately
it's a bit weird
you usually want to run your strongest
unit at the front but then like this is
it's a little jacked up
[Laughter]
look i i like a
sheep okay
i do
okay well in that case let's do this
let's
let's melon our turtle for the peacock
you could do this in a few different
ways then we'll put garlic on this hippo
and my dream
is that we can scale this hippo quickly
oh we should have put the giraffe on it
but it it's giving buffs to a unit that
is good that buffs on um that's re this
is a loss
this is like a meta build
i run it myself i'm not going to pretend
to be upset
it's like if you get the chance to we
were actually not that far off but
they're going to scale out of control
um if you get the chance to roll you
know like a monkey hippo dodo build yeah
you're going to be like let's do it so
uh our sheep as good as it is
you know the giraffe serves more of a
long-term purpose
which is okay
sell me
buff me
roll me
i think i've come to realize that
giraffe is not that good upgraded
i would i i'm okay having it as a plus
one plus one
to the hippo and then selling it later
oh you need a monkey it's like we might
be late but this is one of the only ways
uh we we get ourselves out of this i
think
and then we want our hippo to to level
up faster and we wanted to have melon at
some point you peace
it all comes down to this uh
this fish at the back but you know we we
do really well against the rams
so this is this is quite nice actually
we're gonna be just fine but six wins
six wins
okay so the giraffe is not a long-term
part of our plan
really only the hippo uh
the uh and the monkey well really only
the hippo i guess in that case is a long
term part of our plan
um
which means you can actually se oh okay
no it's good sell the cow
freeze you roll two monkeys temporarily
not quite 12 monkeys starring
brad pitt bruce willis we can upgrade
our hippo to level 2 or our monkey to
level 2 next turn very nice stuff
this one could be a loss but we we got a
squad now like well we got a hippo which
is a a nice uh a nice part of the game
but i see i see horse turkey i'm a
little scared but i love my double
garlic here
be nice to snipe that turkey with our
blowfish
we might not need to now that i look at
it like
the hippo does super well against this
kind of build
we're holding very steady right now
not a big deal
we actually we live through that we
don't live through the through the
turkey but that's okay like look at this
that went very well
now we lose to big units at the front
and there's not much we can do about
that
we shouldn't have combined you yet that
was actually genuinely a poor play um
because now we we're stuck right like i
need to
i need the chocolate something
i think it makes more sense to chocolate
you because you're gonna give better
buffs you know what i was gonna roll a
scorpion but now we'll definitely roll a
snake behind here
uh and a snake with melon armor on it is
gonna do some serious work we could
totally dump our peacock what is this
double whale build here like the tiger
whale it's got it's got me freaking out
a little
uh our snake is not gonna live to do too
much
because it's gonna get killed by this
next uh deer that shows up hey but we
killed the we killed the tiger
which probably i have to imagine that
throws a real damper into their overall
plan here
we do still kill here as well
can you believe this like this is this
is some good stuff man
what do we have seven wins now eight
wins holy crap
uh pair it it it scales nicely but it's
overall not what we're looking for but
like no offense to the peacock but
an expensive melon armor actually kind
of a great get there
um you could roll elephant in front of
blowfish but with a level one blowfish
it's just like a little cheesy
i don't find it that good i think
we'll roll two monkeys for the time
being we got two life to play with so
34 36 hippo really looking for some
chocolate hoping not to run into 50 50s
here i think we counter their build
nicely until the dog who knows what
happens after that
beautiful shot can't be mad break the
melon armor on the dog you love to see
it
we win this yeah okay dude this this is
a squat and we haven't even put together
the avengers yet like this is just iron
man
it's not a turkey build um
you can absolutely do this
it is funny to think about like putting
a crab out there that gets uh 40 hp but
it makes our snake a lot worse to do
this
uh steak it's fine i think it's a little
overrated
yeah yeah yeah okay sell me you i love
the hippo scaling is nice but we're
close to max anyway i think you're
better off getting like a double snake
plate and then rolling for
you know more snakes in particular in
the future
this this could definitely be a second
win like a 10 win right here um this
squad can win you the game and we're
getting stronger every time
their own hippo is is garbage here we're
going to win we're going to get 10 wins
yeah very nice okay
that's just actually kind of easy all
right
four four ten i can live with that

oh you heard of this new game
every time i play uh super auto pets i
like to check out the super auto pets
directory on twitch and see how it's
doing
categories we think you'll like super
auto pets 6.1 000 viewers
now we have you know what one two three
four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12.
12 people except for me
are playing
with me accepted are playing this
dude des
it's still getting there
some of these stream titles there's
there's some german
do any any german gamers here what is
often
off them
erston tenor
rune
it means road to getting 10 wins
on the way to the top ten yo
let's go
i told you my german is really good
since i played schlockden star
spiel that one time
anyway um
here we i was gonna slash marker again
it had been a while
we're on the free-to-play build
it feels weird playing this on a large
screen you definitely roll ants
mosquitoes takeable free to play
mosquitoes takeable
if you're gonna take a horse you have to
take a horse first
it has to be the first thing you buy on
turn one so we're actually gonna roll a
duck here and then i'm gonna uh
poop my pants and cry a little bit oh
you know okay hold on we're gonna be the
edible ears and we're gonna open up the
casino with an ant this is very unlikely
to be a win but it is a possible draw
it's a possible draw
this is a bad squad
very similar team but but pig beats duck
wow we draw just perfect luck comrade
snarky should have had me
it's not your fault really
you know what two pigs is good i think
you gotta prioritize getting some pears
and i'm not talking about the fruit
that's beautiful um
straight up i'm like chili's she's
like i'm going to go insane okay here's
what i'm going to do
right
yeah
then
we're going to get a freaking sweet
level
three next turn
the sniper of the century dude the horse
snipes have been going freaking wild for
us lately
we draw we draw because of that draw
with a with double duck is a win a spin
with pigs which don't even do anything
except like b stats
um
and chill okay this is is beautiful this
is a beautiful thing
some creatures we very much enjoy
getting buffed here for sure
um so you just use your noggin right so
you put
probably a blowfish
i guess maybe right behind this ant you
put a peacock right behind the blowfish
honestly
sell me
freeze freeze me
freeze me because the 3 4 cricket is
okay
no no no we prefer double ants
i i think there's no way we lose this
round we could draw
we could draw but we don't lose this
round
we got a great setup four six uh
mosquito or a cricket kind of spooky
remember that part where i said we don't
lose these
i still believe it but it's a little
closer than i thought it was gonna be
well kind of
there's there's wind number one
you pretty much have to try a dodo
especially with possibly two pills
coming
going offline guys
we can roll a double dodo we can roll we
can roll another ant up here
and then you gotta do something you
gotta you i mean we gotta do
you got to do something we're not
rolling a shrimp scampi build i'm
telling you that so let's let's get
something like this going
sokatoa video is wild
it's uh it's uh regrettable
that's for sure
please oh dude this ox is gonna go hard
you peace yeah this is this this one's
definitely a loss there's a bit of a
meta build here
why not buff the peacock
the the video not the video the the dodo
needs
buffs to be useful
and its buff gets passed forward at
least it's attack buff so that's my
logic perhaps you disagree with my logic
there's room for us all to to pog we all
pog down here
it's round five i think we have to try
uh
this and then
you sell one ants
put a little dolphin in play gives us a
nice
a nice chance for the future we got to
stay like kind of we got to start
leveling up some units
oh their whale is now useless like it
one of the big mistakes i make we gotta
actually like commit to getting some
units out there instead of just like
constantly swapping him him me him me et
cetera et cetera we actually lose this
but it's pretty close
we don't sweat that too much
donkey tanki
please hit my dodo
peacock's okay level two peacock i guess
we're rolling with the peacock a little
longer
do me a favor we're gonna roll peacock
at the front
we're gonna roll kangaroo just behind
that for the time being
and you know what hey
we're actually gonna sell this dolphin
even though we just bought it we're
gonna freeze a turtle
remember when i said we were not gonna
sell as many things
the peacock melon armor is is
valuable level one dodo
their mid transition on their build we
might be able to squeeze out a little
juice on this one
you piece they're like they're exactly
freaking
whatever we draw we'll take a draw here
we got three lives to play with invest
in a can
you absolutely can
an early hippo
combined with any scaling can win you
the game
we've got a few too many draws to be
super confident in it but it's
i mean there there's there's stuff to
like
i thought they were combining i was like
dodo peacock
now rooster i like but we'll wait
we'll wait just a little bit
the can is actually you're going to
freeze me
you're going to can me
now we're going to spit out
a 9 12 hippo next turn with the pair
attached to it
we need some garlic for sure this hippo
is going to be a bit of a boss
i don't use that term loosely
this is really bad
this is gonna body us
this is a nasty team man
okay
hit me
him me him him me
beautiful it's it's important
the blowfish has no reason to exist
anymore we have investments to make
um
my
my frozen pear whatever is still good
get ready to peel the turtle and then
create a turtle
okay four it's gonna be a 17 17 hippo we
got a four squad marty which scares the
crap out of me honestly but actually
would you look at this this works out
fantastically for us
okay
scaling please scaling please scale me
scale me
we don't really need a dodo to make our
turtles stronger
alas on the other hand you're like
melons just great
chocolate is important now you don't
need to exist anymore
i think this is a roll me
we're probably gonna we're on you know
what we're on round nine i'm gonna level
the dodo
it's an important moment on every run
there's a moment where you look back
when it's over
and you say to yourself
we shouldn't have pivoted or you say to
yourself i'm so glad we pivoted
for now
we can slot you in you can exist
then we roll
probably about to engage in one of the
dirtiest by me selmies you're ever going
to see sell a cow
buy a cow
milk me malk me
18 21 just hit the spicy unit please
this looks okay
oh no you almost killed my fly that
doesn't do anything anyway this looks
great we're absolutely gonna body this
bee we're gonna kill the kangaroo we're
gonna body the sheep
the shark
seems like a problem okay but we do well
maybe not maybe it's actually totally
fine
the miffed buttocks
hippo's doing some good work
a deer and a fly do okay together but
we're really we're just waiting for a
turtle to exist
or a turkey sorry
sell me
a cow
i mean buy my cow from me
do me a favor
quick little melon armor on top of our
peacock
what the
a free gold
yummy
okay
roll me
you're a piece
roll me
new fly economy just dropped
we don't need a level 3 dodo but
who says no you know i mean i i kind of
think you
freeze me
play me
and then do it like this and you like a
a sheep basically just exists to get
more fly triggers
we're buying it for like temporary fill
based purposes
this looks amazing again
like we we kind of hard well i wouldn't
say we hard counter a spawn build but
with a turkey maybe that makes up for
some of the difference but we're still
doing some serious work here
they they have a good team but i don't
think they quite got where they needed
to get
they don't have their fly yet
dude this hippo is going freaking wild
oops
another win
why not
why not
freeze me
can me
we might not keep the sheep around
forever
this is the exact same team
it's literally the same team
[Laughter]
well i i'd be very disappointed if we
lose this one
hold on we're gonna we're gonna be in a
tighter spot than i thought these guys
are a little stronger now
what's the value of dodo
i mean you're right it's not generating
that much for us like six attack on two
units
but but what if it
what if i did it
you ever think about that
dodo sucks i
adam sandler voice i disagree
i am a believer in the monkey
however
it's getting a little late but i'm still
happy to see it
okay
it's a tough decision a turkey is huge
we're not summoning anything right now
i think you
this is gonna people are gonna flip
their freaking lid so we're not going to
buy let me let me walk you through my
my thought process okay
we're freezing a turkey
if we lose the next round or in our
subsequent roles we get a great pivot
opportunity
because it does play off you know what
it plays off the flies never mind we're
selling
sell the peacock
this is madness
but i want to invest in the hippo sell
the peacock
move your monkey
play your turkey
whatever we'll do we'll think about it
in a second now the fly needs melon
armor
and honestly
temporarily let's give you one of these
this all this all makes sense this all
computes
will you freeze the monkey no i think
the monkey is at some point soon going
to be sold in order to put another sick
unit out there because i think we're
kind of past the monkey's best before
date in terms of its scaling factor
um
this looks fine by the way
not not bad in the slightest
beautiful
that's the believer win right there
like in my opinion i would rather
get acute scaling and have a flexible
position here like something like this
yummy
yummy
selmy
and then like it's
it it is not good for the dodo
but a shark does really nicely in this
position regardless
we might have got we might have gone a
little hard
the here's the thing dodo kind of sucks
but also he kind of you know
i mean like you could level it up but
he's only making
six extra attack on our hippo it's not
that big of a deal man
a bigger deal i think would be like this
holy brush
everyone everyone relax please
i'm pogging
nice um
nice melon armor be a shame if i didn't
quite crack through it because you're
honestly like pretty strong be a shame
if i
killed you with my dodo
whatever the shark's pogging
nice steak
except i missed the part where it's not
that nice
easiest win in my life
pop me
 god
okay
sell me
is
it's too much of a good thing right
because if they
we need the the turkey
benefits more from being further back
then the tiger gives us a benefit for
having double turkeys you might
be able to run
a double
shark
with a tiger but
i'm not sold on that
tiger fly is just it runs into capacity
issues
tiger hippo
i've never
here's the thing okay it could work but
i've never seen it pop
i've never seen it pop
but
maybe we'll decide
after some time that this looks better
than
it does right now give it a try at least
yeah actually i should have taken that
sheep when it showed up earlier uh
they're me but stronger
they're me but exactly as strong
it's all it comes down to our shark
this definitely looks like a loss
it's a strong peacock man you gotta
respect it
chloe did exactly 30.
oh you gotta try man
this can still win i'm not sure if it's
tiger hippo
you know i think it's
i think it's hippo deer
i know this is a very unusual
look for a squad this is the new look
squad
the deer is going to create
summons which is also going to create
flies which are going to faint and our
shark is going to pop off to the
freaking stratosphere
it's going to look really bad for a bit
here that's only a level one hippo man
that's
that's snoozable
we get it right here that's good stuff
blowfish is gonna be a little bit of a
pain in the butt
blowfish is doing some work
stop it
stop it
oh my god if we had one more well if we
had two more hp we're making it past
that it's still not bad this is a seven
seven win run
those blowfish went wild man
you threw hard so true so true
cheeto dust lining
the dentin
it's never
it's never a situation where like other
people are good it's always like i'm
impressed
chance in internal locus of control
considering that they blame
everybody else on earth for all of their
problems they're always like oh i
they're you're in control you're in
control of your own success in the game
at all times
start prediction will nl get six wins or
more
start it up
i'm not i'm not upset we got seven wins
that's a great win oh and this is okay
you buy
you're not good enough although you are
a pair
this is the squad i'm happy with the
pivot i'm happy with the pivot this team
does not
lose
game one
it can draw
it can also lose
is the thing golden poop
sub-optimal
bad taste confirmed
okay these are big plays though they got
the perfect mosquito shot
big freaking whoop man
that's
this is a buy me freeze me freeze me
very interesting setup here
holy
that's hilarious you can't even like you
you just say thank you thank you for the
dub on that one and best of luck to you
i want you to get to 10 wins if you're
running that squad i want you to get to
10 wins
i'm thinking
it doesn't seem like a badger build to
me but you know what
i our bet's over i apologize to the uh
to the believers
but like i think the concept of a badger
build
and maybe like some hedgehogs
is very funny
i've i i've had some
i i played a run last night on my phone
where i uh
i had like a whale
hedgehog build and then just all of my
units had a bunch of hp
like it was whale hedgehog and then the
hedgehog had a a one-up on it and it got
to like six wins
that's a lot of fun i i like the i like
running a little bit of zayn whenever
possible
like a
right now it's not great but
you give it some time technically you
could pill an ant and it could hit a
dodo
i think you got to give it a try and if
it doesn't work then it doesn't work
it's fine six five level one fish yeah
it's a lot of fun um
i think with two peacocks you kind of
gotta send it
but i'm not
necessarily loving life but we can
bring a flamingo back
if you freeze it which we didn't and
then pill it and make the dodo stronger
i don't know maybe
okay we gotta so we're going up against
the strong squad
you're lucky
still lucky level two horse pretty spicy
here this is a loss
never mind it's a draw
let's go
pill the badger one of these days one of
these days
people are gonna
they're gonna cheese me off
and i'm gonna do it man i'm gonna pill
that badger not today though
fish me you peace
freeze me we're on round five i'm gonna
try
freeze me
we uh love this also we are family
i've got all my sisters in me
we get that dodo to the next level we
roll a penguin out there we have great
stuff great stuff
this ain't that spooky
you peace
you peace
you peace you peace the greatest
blowfish of all time
it's okay though because you're not long
for this world
you're the easiest buy of my life
you're the easiest sell of my life
you're the easiest buy of my life we're
so close to like such amazing scaling
buy me
roll me
with this is roll territory if rowling
was ever incentivized now is the time
i don't know why i'm still freezing a
pill here
roll me
i mean i'm not like mad
just
just think it's funny that's all
okay i like this we punch through your
your good units
you're dead
three wins
must play
must play
must play penguin scaling it's like do
once you get a penguin the run becomes a
lot easier most of it at least the
piloting becomes easier
everybody laugh at thomas 777 they're
running a snail on their builds
everybody everybody point and laugh
we've been in that situation i know what
it feels like
i just need to see one of the things i
already got
sorry we're going to get chocolate at
some point oh
okay
fish can scale
just dodo man
dodo
we are now in
a food meta freeze
no because what are you selling to get
that freaking nothing man nothing
absolutely nothing say it again
you could sell the cricket
to roll
a monkey
absolutely
this squad is looking okay
1920 dog up at the front that's a little
that's a little spiced
this is a loss
this you know what you gotta respect it
double double dolphin build is a very
novel strategy you gotta love it we have
one hp left that life comes at you fast
man
sell me
buy me
buy me
honestly
that's this is how you know i'm a little
unconfident
please
please
no no no
no
how does this squad lose
four wins
on that that was the dream squad
that is the the most painful doubter
payout of all time
anyway we'll run it back
they need health not attack oh yeah i
should have just put the odd odd on them
instead you know the the thing that does
what a dodo does but for uh health
instead of attack
that's my bad why didn't i just put an
odd odd on them instead of a
dodo this is not uh it'll be the foamy
eruptions this is not a great squad
but it's a this is a drawable squad you
get a lucky snipe could be a winnable
squad
a draw
that would be a good animal
uh for me to poop on maybe
it's a little too little too late
unfortunately but
we can
i mean in principle like honestly
you can roll this for a minute just see
how it goes
it's spooky
it's not that spooky though
it's a win look at that
yeah i mean health in
most situations
health is more valuable
we should start here
that's pretty good
in most situations health is more
valuable than
attack which is why like um
like melon armor is like the most
valuable thing in the whole freaking
game i don't think we're gonna pill this
turtle yet i think i'm happy with it
existing
i'm not gonna run horse
i'm gonna run a flamingo
my thinking being
weak oh it's a scary squad
not ideal um my thinking being that uh
we can use the
flamingo with a pill later to buff a
unit that would help our scaling that
was a nice win
garlic armor is better
than melon armor fight me i agree uh
if you're the kind of gamer that never
gets past like round seven
at the end of the game
not so much
now i think our fish has to go even
though it's got a b attached the
mosquito has level up potential for our
future
we will
temporarily
buy a dodo we might not run it forever
okay
we will probably run it forever
we will sell a cricket
so we can afford the giraffe this is
some nice scaling
this is a temporary squad but it's this
is pretty good
this is a pretty good start
even we we could fairly easily lose but
we got i mean if we get two pills this
dodo is starting to
you know he's off the planet isn't he
going to freeze himself
easiest draw of my life
holy bursh
okay well you need a whale so the
mosquito honestly brother you had your
chance
you will whale
a turtle
such a bad flamingo dude
technically you could roll it like this
i guess that's a little smarter
3-1 flamingo at the back is not it's not
what you want to see
very valuable
freeze me
shut up
yeah i know why did you put garlic on
him when he couldn't get the melon on
him
it's called intimidation
i don't know what i'm doing here um
yeah this makes no sense but
i want to buy it anyway let's invest in
our future
i'm pretty stoked for that 2-3 giraffe
man not a fan of the camel i think it
can work i think i think in the right
circumstances it can you can get the job
done
holy crap you're gonna kill your own
snail thus turning your draw into a loss
nice elephant
probably probably the snail at the front
the elephant at the back i think
um
it's good okay now at some point we can
still peel the turtle
although to be honest with you if we
could pill it later because the well no
it doesn't matter it's still running
into the exact same problem
um
the dodo
can have this yeah i mean it bumps the
turtle and then the turtle gets eaten
but that's just a classic kind of like
dodo build problem
it's still in my in my experience is
still worth the
it's worth the cost
we need something a little bit more
transformative here
which i guess will be this for now
dude
yeah yeah hold on
yeah yeah
this is top tier
dodo's also getting the melon
[Laughter]
whoops uh whoopsies
you're so freaking actually you know
what we're lucky we had the melon armor
there instead of the garlic never mind
i thought i had more units than this
oh the dolphin snapped me i understand
now
okay you got me
dolphin dolphins doing some good work
man
for the enemy that is so now this is a
sell me
by me
pill me
by me
roll me
perhaps run me again
we got a lot of room to play with i
think you gotta try
right yeah my bad
we can now sell the giraffe which means
we can put another unit out there
people are like move the move the dodo
behind the giraffe yeah but i want the
giraffe to permanently buff the dodo
instead of the dodo temporarily buffing
the giraffe
mind you it might have saved us on that
one
like this is not long for this world
like this guy is gone
the giraffe is going bye-bye cause we
got a a permanent buff in this situation
instead
so i guess we could have put the penguin
there yeah it is fair
it's fair
we still like this
and i think we still like this as
strange as it may look and actually
for the time being an ox does wonders
right here
okay
we're getting ready to dump our
probably getting ready to dump our whale
don't lose this one
give him garlic too
full wasted garlic squad incoming
thanks for the melon okay your hippo's
not as not as strong as you thought it
would be
sad
this is an easy win okay this this squad
is pumping
level me
up i need some levels i need some levels
more than anything else i need some
levels
i mean you can call me crazy man i'm i'm
starting to get of the opinion that
we're gonna end up rolling like
this
why
because
i don't want to get rid of my turtle
he's cool
he's scaling
i guess he's still scaling all right
roll me then
roll me once more
scale me
okay good good work penguin
whale sucks
prepare to be ashamed of your words and
your deeds okay
oh no my penguin just kidding it sucks
anyway nobody cares about it
owns
melon armor is a slap in the face here
it's pretty bad for business honestly
never mind uh get owned
so close
all right we lose this one
i still we need one more right two more
this is a this is a two-able build
something like
something like this
this
this
not yet we need a penguin
better
i don't expect our hippo to pop yet
but as long as their hippo doesn't pop
i'm very happy they've invested in
future scaling
this seems fine this seems fine
this seems fine
this seems fine
this seems fine this seems fine
this is the squad
okay
uh i almost just it stopped let's not do
that let's do this next step
is melon armor
hippo i guess it already gets it yeah i
don't know what the next step is then
i'm very confused i see we have a very
similar squad here
my hippo
is feeling okay
wow we killed the rooster that's so big
because then we get to go
toe-to-toe like this
much better for us look at that
believers get paid out
i mean there's like legitimately no
reason for a level three dodo i'm not
sold on there being a huge reason for
like a level 3 turtle
but at least you know
we'll get it moving in that general
direction
you know
this worm's a little spooky
we don't have enough to get through oh
but hold on you suck you suck
you genius
that position 4 scorpion in front of a
weak unit
very smart but you know what we did get
to six wins or more
slash marker
sap
one and



hold on
what's
what's 24 hours times 60
1440
you're so lucky that seconds instead of
minutes
you're so lucky
the twitch default on the timeout
command is seconds instead of minutes
otherwise you would have been like the
robot from rocky iv you would have been
going bye-bye
all right
we put our slash marker in start
prediction before you bet we are going
to pay to win
it's 86 400 in seconds
thank you thank you
the game crashed
oh
those are not my words i do not hate the
robot from rocky iv those are sylvester
stallone's words
people said in the director's cut please
do not kill the robot he said it's toast
desperate eyes
they're watching you
they see your every move
why
do you hate winning
you roll this by roll i mean we're
rolling with it
we may not buy a beetle we know we wish
to buy a fish
puzzle it out like this this is a strong
team you cannot get much stronger than
this team to start with three ants
admittedly could could do it
oh we trade with the b at least there's
something there holy bursh
four four it's a
it's a dang draw it's a nasty team
though to to drive to draw with that
team is a is a positive
okay i think
we want to roll a swan for a bit so we
should buff
the swan
sheep is a great unit
maybe put it at the back
and it's almost like it has bees on it
throw some bees on it um i'm gonna get
you close to a level i still like this
squad quite a lot
i think the sheep is maybe a little
worse
um
in pay to win because you know you're
not rolling like horses as much or
anything like that
still i like my team i like my team
you're gonna you're not gonna pill my
aunt yet
and we're not gonna scampi just yet this
okay now we're freaking talking dude
everybody relax
play me
you ready for this yes
i want
to feed you are we going to feed you i
don't know you have to roll a bed if
you're rolling a bat the fish should go
the fish should go goodbye
you've served your purpose
you buy a bat
good
we could have fed you and then don't
worry about it okay
we will peel you
suboptimal
you
i want a caterpillar early
so that it gets experienced faster
freeze me
freeze me
next turn
next turn
we will
work the flamingo in
peel the bat confirm doubter
probably should have beetle at the front
but this is okay
we can at the front weaken at the front
weaken at the front oh
all skill baby 20 21
oh nice caterpillar too bad it sucks
anyway we draw
anyway we lose um that was good though
simple skill difference
by me
what's gonna scale for us i guess we
don't know yet
it's probably we we don't want to pot
commit to anything yet
the beetle is not long for this world so
we should get rid of it
now
do this
sell me
buy me you you know okay we're bringing
it back sell me by me
i don't think long term we go sheep so i
say screw you sheep i say screw you
however you know what i also do i say
excuse me
i say excuse me kill me
freeze me
confront me
oh
you were supposed to go here
you
mother
it's okay gap in the middle it's called
covered
prevent defense cover 12.
nice bat
we draw these
saved huge huge save
yeah we kind of need you
we kind of need you
and then we're going to do a lot of
buying and selling
you know what happens when you do a lot
of buying and selling
you know what happens when you do a lot
of a lot of buying and selling you think
about thinking about running a shrimp
scampi but you also acknowledge that
it's a little late
you acknowledge the lateness
yeah there's no there's no space for a
scampi it's hilarious but it's not right
now because we're buying so much i wish
to keep my swan
we need to do buying selling like it has
to be done okay like
it's the only way our caterpillar gets
popped
roll me i just oh that's the freaking
ticket
here's here's how you do it
buy me
sell me
buy me
freeze me for next time
keep me around a pill or just having a
pill around is the dream
holy persh
no they're running two caterpillars too
are you seeing this anyway we win these
they're going to be scary next year
though you can totally run a worm with a
caterpillar but are we scaling the worm
or are we scaling the bison
i think if you can can a worm like
there's stuff to like
like the goat is nice but like what do
you sell
to get the buy sell working on the goat
you know like we can't sell a
caterpillar a bat is game-winning
you can sell the chick but you need to
eat
something else to have the space to buy
something else which means you have to
sell the swan which i say no to
try to make me sell my my
big bird and i say no no no i'm not
selling my bad man
the bad is is the greatest
gamer in the game
it's the most important of all the
gamers
instead you do a sell me
a buy me
yum a sell selmy
yummy
a
roll me
a by me
a selmy
a skunk me
this bison is gonna take a bit man it's
gonna you that's what you freaking do it
that's why you keep the bat around
and you wanted me to kill him i mean
sell him
sell me
until we get cans
i can't
buy me
roll me um
[Laughter]
sell me um
buy me
sell me
it's the dream
buy me
freeze me
buy me
sell me
buy me
oh baby level three caterpillar next
turn
poodle builders double poodle build very
scary very scary team
certainly seems to me like a guaranteed
loss
that's spicy it's all right
caterpillar's coming out here where are
we at now we're on okay
two losses but our caterpillar pop-in is
amazing even if we don't have the space
to make it work um sell me holy birch
buy me
buy me
roll me just in case we get another
snail
okay sure sell me
buy me
sell me
honestly
no i'm not rolling bison i'm not i'm not
rolling bison
i think it's too late for the bison
scaling even with the plus two plus two
to get there it's too late
we need we leave the space open so we
can trade we day trade we day trade
bison's turn nine two losses imo bison
too slow instead
buy me
sell me
buy me
don't really care for a level 3 swan
level one bad it's okay oh
i don't know
i'm happy to have some splash damage let
me tell you
oops
oops
holy
oh we tie these we tie these
foods just pretty good
by the way we can get some garlic on our
bison
we win way more often
okay three we don't care really two
four two four you're not long for this
world um
sell me
by me
our next cell becomes the swan
but i don't think it'll happen this turn
have you ever had heard of story oh we
got to put the bison in the caterpillar
have you ever heard of storybook brawl
uh not only have i heard of it um i have
a 100 percent confirmed win rate in
storybook brawl
i have never lost a game of it including
against stream snipers
it's a little late for a rhino to pop
we really want our bat to level up
i think we got to go fairly heavy on the
rolls here
round 11
send me
by snail mouth you're why are you being
a troll mouth why are you trolling
trolls get an 86400 slash timeout 86400
around here
we're going to run t-rex and it's going
to be a cell on the
swan
and then it's going to be a t-rex at the
back poodles at the front
because we need them to buff the bison
that's freaking huge
that's freaking huge this is freaking
we just i overran my scaling it was not
on purpose but
it paid off
[Laughter]
hey s happens sometimes oops you're dead
oops you're dead you're dead nice little
810 cow at the back get owned
there's simply not enough time
for another caterpillar to pop
it's irrelevant
roll me freeze me
end me confirm me
oh baby
yeah we almost played playing squid game
in super auto pence
oops
win number seven
rip me never doubting again
that's what i like to hear
you know what why not
never seen a level three t-rex before
so spice excuse me a rat
is this allowed
a rat in the eight wins here
right the b you thought the b was gonna
do it
on win eight are you are you over the
beat
oh
plus six plus six to all units
[Laughter]
oh
you're freaking lucky man
no you're not that lucky but you're
freaking lucky
oh
what a squad
look at that
this weld you can't be mad about that
man
at this point we could probably sell a
poodle and run a turtle
um
like i'm basically just fishing for a
turtle
i'm i'm willing to go pretty deep we
don't need the level 2 okay so
honestly you get out of my face you suck
you go here and then
you know what why don't you take one of
these on you
why
having the ability to get melon armor
on the
butterfly is the dream
you lose the scaling yeah but on very we
lose scaling on the bat in the turtle
because the caterpillar's already going
to be 50 50. so
we
you get oh that's a scary team hold hold
the front door we got you all right look
at they got the same idea man they're
running the same squad
oh you can't be mad about that
and that's literally just us but
stronger
like to be honest that's the strongest
eight run
uh loss
or eight run win i guess we've ever had
still a great team though
it's that you know what two caterpillars
man they were one step ahead of us
start prediction run it back
it's been a believer's paradise for sure
you gotta roll pairs you see them early
you gotta roll them it's a doubter's
shop
be a fatherly geyser
now keep in mind i told you okay i told
you it's a doubter shop
it's a it's a bad uh
a bad start but we can get there over
time
roll a little i think we can play one
we gotta roll a little deeper here
you must play an ant to have a chance to
win
and then
combine my beetles the pigs sell nicely
as two instead of one
another scary team oh that's that's
oh
we still lose
just for the record
but that was about as good as it could
have gone
all right so we're we're down to life
early that's just shop meta man you
can't you can't control that what you
can control is um
sell me
by me believers are shaking
literally shaking right now
sell me
buy me
sell
me
him me him him me sell me
him me
okay
roll me
we really need
a little stroke of luck
that's strokable

without a fight
can me
buy me we have to see if we get a
caterpillar on a roll
i know you're like you're getting the xp
for free
we need to turn this 5-8 into a 14-15
holy burst
it's actually going to be uh 1920.
we're going to freeze
because next turn
we're going to move turtle so it hits
the caterpillar peacock's gonna get the
garlic
freeze that bat
forget the sauropod for now it's not the
right time
scary
they got a 2415
butterfly
we will trade with it
we draw we take those draws we take
those draws
give me a bat
you know
why why what
yeah that's better okay
still good
temporary regression
for future benefit
level two turtle would be pog man level
two
you're so lucky
this is a loss
[Laughter]
the the level two bad hit is real nice
took away our garlic
the regression the regression was the
wrong time sorry
that was an honorable play there was
honor involved we run it back
pay to win it's been a little little
spicy today
you have to roll a two of
who
first round you never know will be the
backwards bagpipes
no promises round one
uh we win these we win it with a cricket
dunka
dunka
dunka
now the dream
the dream for fish is you make two level
twos and then turn it into a level three
that is like
it's
it's what dreams may come it's the stuff
of i am legend
holy crap
i think we still draw
just barely but it's a nice it's a nice
drop
well no matter what you start here
unless you get like a top tier unit
an owl can be run temporarily
really wanted to see a little fish there
um but that's okay
because we can totally
combine
give me a little double roll here still
a good squad
one more fish and this run goes to the
freaking moon man
9 10 ladybug at the back kind of spooky
it's not that spooky though we win this
with a cricket holy birch
roll me
roll me
roll
me roll me
roll me
roll me
roll me
roll me
roll me
freeze me
you can't tell me
that this game doesn't have a desire
sensor
a situation like that we went through 17
rolls
didn't get a single fish
i don't buy it i i simply don't buy it
anyway this is a loss but that's
expected
i i don't buy it
is it sell me don't double my okay
that's fine
buy me
pill me
thrill me
by me
it's not as bad as it looks
freeze me
freeze me i have a feeling this might be
relevant
[Laughter]
i just i i can't believe that we have
not seen a fish up to this point please
hit the garlic let's go
our own fish got screwed too like this
is it's not looking great just to be
just to be honest
what is happening
some people will tell you i got a little
bit lost in the sauce
those people don't even know what sauce
is yet
i hate to do it man you know we're
getting a fish in one second here now
this is a much better squad
clip farmed
it's okay it's okay copium it's okay
we we win these we win these with a
snail
okay
we
sell these
we
buy these
we
superfish these on a turn seven
he may be slow but watch him go i'm lost
in the sauce man i don't know what we do
here
we can't sell a rooster it's too
important
we can sell the fish at some point
i think you can freeze me freeze me i
like this shop even though freezing the
whole food shop seems a little backwards
it's a little late for you
this turn
give me some garlic on a unit most
likely to survive long term in the
future
because the fish might not be long for
this world level too bad that's cute
yeah
to be expected
they don't have any units on their team
that do anything
how sad for you
we go up to four wins
we don't need the can just yet doesn't
help our rooster
straight up
now i'm going canned salad just because
the numbers look nice
level one bat
excuse me exquisite order
oh
this looks
like an easy win probably the easiest
win of my life
level two okay hold the front door
level too bad
this is highly relevant
sell your cricket
well i don't know sell sell the fish
yeah sell the fish they're in the same
category qrikets slightly better stats
maybe it scales better in the future
because we can level it one more time
and get a trigger off of it but buy me
buy the can well no because you know
what the sauropod is not good
spy buy me first then buy the can i'd
rather have the refund because we don't
care about you getting buffed
specifically
that might be completely backwards but
um we're gonna freeze you
we are going to
still it's too late for the bison i'm
not sweating it i think we're gonna buy
some food
what the heck is the caterpillar gonna
scale off man
probably if we can get our bat popping
like
oh baby
because the bats gonna stick around
lovely lovely
uh
this is uh this is lol city i hate to
say it but it's a lull city white weenie
build in pay to win low
did we just pay out the believers did we
just become best friends
believers win
somewhat surprising considering this is
also uh a run where we rolled
ten times on one of our turns
you gotta go
we know we're getting bats but you don't
have to do it just yet you can do
there's an order to things
you can buff a bat
get a refund
buy a cow
buff the bat
it's
free free buying is free free is buying
roll me
holy brush
by me
move me
i don't know if i'm gonna run
two caterpillars but
this is where we are this is where we
are right now
batman at the front
love to see it
freaking freaking fish armor okay you're
very strong congrats you're very strong
yeah yeah yeah you're very strong wow
what a strong fish
yummy
the game almost broke
by me
ain't nobody got time for that
holy brush
i can't stop saying it i'm sorry i know
the t-rex won't work this turn our
long-term success passes through this
t-rex
please are these big plays nobody knows
big enough to get us through that at
least
okay
okay
okay
holy crap
seven wins
holy birch
freeze me
scale me
could really use some melon armors
cancel his steak you canceled this steak
okay it's still pretty nasty honestly
it's still really oh no the rhino's
going infinite rip rip
rip me
rip you
rip you we're back
no pills
no stakes
no pairs
we can do better
this is better
you know what
that allows us to stay there
no no bats no bats i see oh microbe is
like a bat in many ways
then level two turtle this is a nasty
squad this is a common
this is a nasty uh pseudo meta squad you
gotta give it the respect it deserves
you know
you got exactly the right math to get
through this
it seems so slow
well done honestly well played i'm i'm
happy we got out of this man
you know we didn't look like a believer
payout for parts of that when we were
rolling ten times on the same turn
and we're going to run one more back
before we play some garlic phone here
it's a squat
this is a squad
50 50 squat
be the miffed organisms
you see ants i'm a simple man i see ants
i win games soapy gnome thanks for the
gifted subscriptions thank you
you can buy one
i'm gonna take a 2-2 i can sell for two
next turn
i'm trying not to buy apples okay i've
been a compulsive apple buyer my whole
life the egg slayer
i mean you got two ants so you may well
be the egg slayer
look at that
mission accomplished
you think they're a stream sniper
kill me don't hit you don't okay thank
you
freeze me roll me
buy me
roll me
in principle it shouldn't be that hard
to
level up a unit uh in practice
apparently it's pretty hard
this one might make you cringe a little
bit go ahead add it to your cringe
compilation
you sell two pigs
to get a sheep out there
and can i tell you something
i'd do it again
ram
beats two pigs
source dude just trust me
we win these
four squad didn't matter four squad
honestly i i'm gonna hit you with some
controversial belief here
i
think in my heart of hearts
i think
that
yes
uh
yes
yes i think that
four squad marty's have a higher win
rate
than full squad marty's
i absolutely hate this
why
because
freeze me
un freeze me we'll get a pill later
freeze me
freeze me
told you we'd get a pill later don't
freeze me
um
you have to be you have to have a high
iq to understand how to play a four
squad marty
little uh
a piddly uh p brain is like i read on
the subreddit never run
four squad marty's
only
geniuses
who think creatively will ever run a
four squad
because it breaks a rule of thumb
got it memorized
i like it
i love it
i don't love it that's that's just
terrible math and yet we win
no
we draw okay
forgot there was a spider
oh look i don't like a mosquito okay
not i'm not trying to go to bed for the
mosquito
you gotta buy it you gotta go yes
him
me
him
him
i'm very confused
okay sell me
look it's
look
i thought they were combining i was so
afraid
i was petrified
this looks weird
hold hold on hold on man
puppy scaling turn six too late too late
for you
the exact right time for you though
and some garlic irrelevant right now
garlic fructose irrelevant right now i'm
not sold on this turn
but i'm i'm a believer in our future
what an interesting idea you had here
you're so freaking lucky you're so
freaking lucky level level one peacock
we get a win there
pill me
buy me
sell me
buy me
buy me
roll me
two three four two
freeze me
please please
we killed their bison
this is a huge loss
all right we got time for one more we
got time for one more
we had 65 belief holy crap
hey doubters just slide some channel
points under my door
you got to take pairs but bluebird is is
insane doo doo tear
hmm
be the warmish craters
oh god
[Laughter]
no no no no you can't
you can't do that
all right i mean that's just you know
sometimes
by the way all uh guaranteed all-natural
shop by the way that was that was not a
resinous shop they just probably got
three fish naturally
guarantee i guarantee it
this is one of the rare situations that
i'm like actually going for an apple in
the hopes that maybe you can survive a
little longer
you you beat a bee i think
please please please
oh
we drop we draw
these dude if we can get melon armor on
this bird i'm gonna
melon armor on this bird i'm kind of
popping okay
i do not expect you to understand what
i'm about to do
all i expect
is for you to trust me
i meant to buy a swan
[Laughter]
he's unhinged we just need a turtle man
nein no
saved
this seems horrible
this seems like it could not be worse
all right let's let's pivot out of this
this is
on the other hand
we feed some cupcakes dude we're we're
good to go
i'm so sorry
on the other hand
[Laughter]
are you seeing this don't weaken me oh
why
we still almost made it
finally
holy brush
now pill me hit that bird at the back
oh you mother
roll me
roll me
roll me
it's not looking so hot garlic could go
a long way here
dude this will work
we didn't get batted
holy crap here it comes
anything but a ram we win and we go to
the races i almost take yes on that one
okay i got nine minutes before gardic
please factor that into your uh mindsets
here
i would
just be aware of what you're doing okay
if you're betting belief here
consider this your your
nevada gaming commission warning that's
like hey
betting is an easy way to lose all your
money
we drew we drew
what is this squad
like are you seeing this
what is this squad
we have five different units and no
pairs
because i was unwilling to take a beaver
pair
saved
that's a huge get we we could not be any
luckier
quite frankly
holy crap
we still have no pairs is is this okay
you can sell a one-two cricket
in order to roll a flamingo
but we want our flamingo to buff
just roll me whatever i'm not i'm not
investing in fish at this point in my
life
it's just
so freaking disaster
flamingo on a pill okay
that way we can roll two ants which
gives us a great chance to survive um
give me one ant that has a b attached to
it
because i don't like our other fiduciary
situations here
ob hive so true
okay nine nine mosquito
not fantastic
i guess it's because you have a hatching
chick fair enough not tomorrow thank you
for the
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
i think we gotta freeze one of these
okay it must be done
an owl can temporarily exist on the
squad
sell me
get ready to pill me
next turn
we pretty much at this point have to
roll the mosquito
i mean we we can't afford to be making
enemies here
f
10 6 though hey at least it kills
in one
pretty bad pretty bad
should have frozen
nevertheless
pop me
pop me
this is not good when you're you're
popping a flamingo
on a level one like basically base stat
uh beetle but
nonetheless here we are sell me
freeze me
roll me
must buy
um you can stay honestly you can stay
frozen we can roll two ants on the squad
here can you move bro can you whatever
you know what can you move can you okay
you know what whatever never mind you're
okay you're cool
four squad marty
you peace
saved
i'm telling you i know i said it earlier
four squads scares the crap out of me
man
what did i what did i tell you
four's four squad wins more than five
squad
it's a simple fact of science
freeze me
this this is like the best unit in the
game it's like the best tier three in
the game
i'm we're going up against the squad of
level ones
everything looks okay we can we can pull
out of this we've only got three minutes
anyway we gotta go faster faster faster
him him me him me him me we win this we
win this we win this we win this easily
faster faster faster faster faster you
get this yeah yeah nice buff a little
melon armor on you top of your melon
armor that's fine we'll just do one of
these real quick we got to go a little
faster let's kill you
probably the worst buff we could ask for
but life goes on hit you with one of
these probably can't afford to can me
can't afford to can me can't afford to
can me uh just give me something decent
freeze me roll me
um we're not gonna have any tier threes
roll me freeze me
free don't freeze me i like you as a
five-five we'll sell you later okay go
go go go go go go
five wins four four more wins four more
wins
this is a scaling build it's early in
the game this benefits us
oh crap
oh crap the fact that our mosquito's
going down that does not benefit us
all right well you know we finished on
time
i pay out the doubters on that one
it
gives me time to go to the bathroom
before the uh garlic section
i'll see you in a couple minutes



everybody
what can you say welcome back we had a
great run
yesterday threw out a 10 win but
was i on no you know i was on uh free to
play
on youtube it was on twitch i was
playing with the pay-to-win i've been
having a rough time of the the pay to
wins lately need a need a level three
bad need a caterpillar or something like
that early on i
do not enjoy
this
shop i would rather have a 2-3 than a
3-2
pears are important this is not a great
starting squad but it's okay
i
will be the clumsy muffins
i will never pick fuzz pots unless
there's alliteration that's that's the
nl advantage that's the nl promise don't
shoot my board thank you
we
draw these and that's okay we're going
up against dad and his unwashed sausages
f what a name what can you say
now ants win games
or rounds at least fish are okay
roll me this is a a nightmare
this is pretty bad
i i hate to do it because we lose the
double buff
but we're not gonna be rolling a ladybug
long term anyway let me get a 3-2 bird
that buffs for one toss me a mosquito
just for like the slightest advantage uh
to get one extra ping of damage
we'll be looking for a uh a level two
bird next turn okay we should win this
round
um but this is like a crazy cool crazy
cool
they're gonna have a nightmare squad in
the future because they're gonna get so
many like farmed level ups okay i mean
this is a gimme
we need a bat
please please any any duplicate
of something we already have that's
absolutely love you have to take an
early caterpillar you get an early
caterpillar you have to take an early
caterpillar the most likely unit to keep
living is our bat so let's make sure our
bat's getting the buff you would sell
your fish because your ladybug is a
little better
right now at least we're gonna roll
we'll freeze
level two and
good for uh many things including ant
farming or or level farming i should say
we might be in trouble early here uh
because this squad is not particularly
inspiring
that was nice i i don't think it'll be
enough but
you know what it's going to be exactly
enough to get us a draw would you look
at that
lucky uh lucky bat weakness kind of
saved us there
next turn we are going to get a level up
via our caterpillar that's a bare
minimum
look you could buy two apples put them
on your bat
or you could use
three re-rolls to try to get a bet
or really anything
that would take you one level higher
i don't think we're gonna go for a level
two bird
um
i'm
upset i would say here
for the time being
you can roll meat on your bat i forgot
about that um
the bat doesn't do that well with any
sort of equipment so in a weird way
giving them meat actually makes sense
weak in the front would be nice
it is what it is this would be very bad
for us
if it hit the the very back but it
didn't we get you we get you you get us
this is this is completely acceptable we
got two levels up incoming
a bison certainly seems like we could
invest in our future with this
so i would say
you can sell your ladybug
buy a bison it won't scale yet but
that's okay get a level two ant going uh
so you could totally roll a worm uh to
be honest as long as you're willing to
buy food for it
our bison scales but it doesn't scale
that fast i i think you sell this
buy this
roll once
um
obviously this is not like the best food
you could ever ask for but i think on
the bison is going to be worth the most
we really need to not lose uh the next
couple of rounds
if we can oh that's pretty bad weak in
the front oh
extreme even though it's still bad
that was the only way we could get out
of this we're still gonna lose actually
but um
we we need to get out of this spiral
quickly if we can get out of the spiral
quickly i actually think we're kind of
fine
and i think the way that you do it is
maybe via you know something like that
yeah you need to
you need to pull out of this one
i can't afford it oh no no
[Applause]
i don't know why i thought we had enough
man okay well freeze me
um this is one where basically you're
just
kind of praying
okay
doubles i actually think a turtle's
pretty good too honestly um this would
be an incredible draw
don't don't don't oh it's just
we just didn't handle it right man the
exact wrong enemy got weakened that's
for sure
or
the exact wrong friend i guess we drew
holy crap just pure luck
i know this is a meme
but draws are actually like big wins for
us uh thanks to
the way that we scale
roll me once
two
four
three four
i mean our bison is not scaling at all
yet that's
horrible
our worm also has not scaled at all
who do we want
for
worm and bison the worm needs to scale
more
the bison is kind of like a value add so
you'll get buffed you'll get buffed for
no reason you'll get buffed
i think i'm if if i'm being honest with
you i think i'm i'm flitting
back and forth between too many
different like synergies at once
but we are one fight away from like the
caterpillar possibly being able to do
something half decent for the first time
in a while
holy crap
i i don't care that we drew like just
not dying is the only thing i could ask
for really so we now have a level three
caterpillar which means our bison's
gonna start the scale
we need to buy foods we're really hoping
they hit the worms
worm i should say we don't really have
worms
guess we'll invest there is
kind of need to go a little bit faster
on that front we could start feeding you
like a bunch of cupcakes
our caterpillar is actually getting
debuffed
now
llama squad
llama squad very interesting
uh
yeah it seems pretty bad
we're on one life and and we deserve to
be on one life
we've not been doing well here give me
one of those
please for the love of god it actually
okay it hit our worm you need to buy
something
i'm not willing to sell anything so just
can me and then pray for the best
we can
you're not gonna believe me i mean with
one win on turn nine
maybe you shouldn't believe me um
but it's not that bad okay like the
poodle dying is not good but in general
like this we we have scaling which is
what you need to create an engine to get
ahead so the fact that we we got ahead a
little bit there feels nice
you definitely want to get a bison
popping i mean uh a regular cat
would also do wonders for us
double leopard i don't think does enough
um and you still we want our worm to pop
it's you know
not an incredible stat
position
we need the you know what
i'm just trying to figure out like if we
want to buff the bison we do it like
this
or even like no because that'll buff the
poodle yeah we do it like this maybe
focusing those buffs on the bison to
make our caterpillar slightly stronger
will be beneficial but
level two bat could get us out of a jam
replace a couple of pieces of equipment
the irony for me is that we're probably
running into people
who are like
oh i'm so annoyed that i keep running
into uh
you know like bat teams over and over
and i'm just out here fighting for my
life
like we're
barely surviving we did get up to three
wins there that's that's good stuff
one up doesn't really apply
it's a tough decision
okay at least we got something there
like the the double food on the worm is
nice
the problem is losing the scaling on
everything else but admittedly it is
only plus one plus one
i think we do maybe a little bit better
by getting one of our creatures to like
a decent level and we're just hoping we
get another poodle later we can totally
run
um a t-rex next turn and then get better
scaling the t-rex is like a strictly
better poodle i think
so we uh rhino please rhino please let's
go
so we got there it's it's actually kind
of funny right like
it just goes to show you that
and this may not be like an eight win
run it just goes to show you as long as
you've got like a thesis you can get
yourself there
that's a must freeze
as long as you can get there before your
you know
hp runs out
as long as you can get off the ground
before your hp hits zero you're
you're feeling okay i understand that
the dangers of the freeze by the way
we're like we're not gonna buy anything
this turn
because we need to keep our scaling high
now like that it was just terrible would
have been better off buying uh
the chocolate and just applying it
somewhere
probably t-rex i guess is the obvious
choice uh
this is very scary on that dog
it's in fact it's just very scary on
everyone but look at that we we made it
to five wins six wins five wins okay so
don't get too ahead of yourself um
i don't know what we would get rid of
but we really do want our caterpillar at
some point to get turtled but maybe not
yet okay
maybe not quite yet we i don't think we
can run a second caterpillar
we can definitely run that and then we
keep our gold if you're wondering why is
he keeping the gold it's for t-rex base
scaling we want melon on our bison
they've got a very similar squad to the
squad we were running level two turtles
pretty bad for us
and they they hit weakness on some
pretty nasty units for us oh my god
you know what you got me you got me with
with some good bat sniping i can't be
mad we benefited from some good bat
sniping but i'll take a 5'4 considering
at round nine we were at one win
we got there
i'm gonna roll
uh this is a great squad
definitely hard to imagine losses early
here
be the
the extra noses wouldn't that be weird
my favorite form of comedy whoa who
thought of that wouldn't that be weird
okay uh we could lose yeah um just
because they summoned an extra unit that
that would be poor but look at this
instead we could also uh just win i
suppose is the other way
that that was like a hearthstone
battlegrounds percentage style
battle this is incredible
i mean the way to play this i think is
this bizarre
squad right here
ants win games it's just their win
rounds again sorry my mistake win rounds
it's hard to imagine
well then you know
that is pretty nasty
uh you're gonna get me you're gonna get
that that was uh honestly kind of
incredible
i'm not mad that's that's just very
funny
let's start here
that's very
nice i know the pill
i think i overrate the pill a little bit
just to be honest with you i think you
definitely would play a swan here
um and i think you'll play it like
like this
i think this squad
is very rough if you're an enemy
more one ant away from a level three
which is gonna hit like a truck in its
own right but also will like
oh let's go
uh we'll
give a nice buff especially if we can
like wail it in the future yeah it'll
take a swan
nothing here is that impressive to me
you're a piece
we got to do something but
well no you know what we actually don't
we would just like to do something if uh
hold on round four freeze this
for next time
buy a cupcake to keep us going here this
is not a strong round economically
speaking but
uh you know it's still early we don't we
don't worry about our scaling too much
early
weakness on the swan is is the worst
but look at this the ant is still going
freaking buck wild didn't even matter at
all
i honestly think a hatching chick might
be the best
uh
tier one unit or a level one unit in the
game like without getting buffed it
still is incredible
a rooster that scales you're getting
into some some
top-tier stuff man you are
i think we we can combine i i honestly
think we're early enough
to make a puppy pop as well
i don't
we're
you i do i think that a hatching chick
leveled up is fine and the experience is
great but i also think that as a plus
five plus five
you we don't need to invest in you like
your your peak utility is
very close to three gold instead of you
know nine
um
now to be honest with you i think i'd
rather
have you here now do we care about an
early rooster i think we we actually
care more about a puppy early if
possible
this may be
incorrect
but i believe okay so there's our level
three
ant and then you stay here you freeze
this you probably put garlic on your
swan next we want this swan to kind of
bolster us uh while we wait for the
puppy uh to to scale to the point where
it can do something and we're also
hoping of course that like a caterpillar
can
do some work as well
we actually lose this but
it's close
we don't sweat it too much and we're
gonna level you up here while we can a
skunk you know
i think you can probably sell a beetle
and roll a skunk temporarily you don't
have to roll the skunk
just yet
i guess we could
do this
two of them is just a little too much i
think it's it's kind of nice
in its own way but you do
um
well you know what now i'm like i think
you do it like this
uh
you do run into like an issue of
whether or not you
are not leveling up something that later
could do something for you like having a
turtle is a unit that can live into the
late game
and this
mission accomplished so far sax therapy
great name we're up to four already two
losses i mean that loss against the
mosquitoes like what are you gonna do
it happens
uh
don't need a can quite
yet garlic on puppy
sure is
it's good stuff
oh we roll once
ah
we buy the puppy
scales at plus four plus four
that's kind of nutty that's kind of
insane uh we we really would like to get
a caterpillar it might be perceived as
being oh level two bat holy crap
uh we get lucky we override it
with our melon armor
this this has a draw written all over it
just barely
i i'd resent losing to bees in the late
game it just it feels bad man
um so i think we like the concept of a
level two turtle
and we can because this is just where
we're at now we're looking at something
like this for sure
we need to keep two gold for the puppy
the puppy scales like a son of a gun
might say at level two at least might
seem again like it's too late for a
caterpillar i think it's totally worth
it we got very lucky with our bats there
that's that's not lucky that's terrible
luck
i hate running in a gold poop man
because you know you're losing to a fan
it's pain
well level two turtle
if we had gone for the chick we could
have made this happen but this is we
didn't so let's move on let's live our
lives i think we're ready to get rid of
a swan
if we're going to get rid of a swan you
could do worse than a 10-10 octopus
we could roll this
we can afford to spend three gold
um
well
you know
i know we're overriding the the
garlic armor by the way but i actually
think that that's kind of the dream
holy crap thank god this is why you have
a turtle by the way is for for bad
protection like this i still think we
lose
or we draw we draw merciful draw we need
better units
and i'm i mean a 7-6 ant
i still think the hatching chick serves
a pr that's the problem i feel like
everything here serves a purpose
we get anti-bat technology
we could get a bat of our own
we can sell an ant to get a cow going in
the future
probably unfreeze this freeze that
instead we would like a bat of our own
i think as well
we gotta live through this though and
that's the that's kind of the problem
i i also don't really like the way our
squad is kind of like
laid out here i'd like to have my
strongest unit at the front but we have
two units that give a buff on faint so
hey you know what i think we got lucky
we didn't have our strongest unit at the
front there
we get a beautiful trade and we're still
we're still chilling am i wrong we
appear to be chilling
that would be five wins
well
this is a huge pivot in all directions
okay
the t-rex is like a it's one of the most
valuable units in the game
i think you have to dump either ant or
hatching chick
for now i think you you can dump the
hatching chick you get a plus six plus
three here
are we gonna do we want food out there
would we rather roll for like a level
three tortoise or something do we want a
can to make you slightly stronger i
don't think so
i think we have to do this okay
then i'm like i i think
a bat
beats a 10-10 octopus as as insane as it
may seem
but are we really comfortable only
having one unit that hits
kinda hard
i don't think so i think i i'm gonna i'm
gonna stay where we're at for the time
being
i like this
so um i mean a 4 8 pretty similar to a 7
6 although you do have garlic you're
going to give plus 6 plus 3 you're going
to give plus 2 plus two which is really
plus eight plus eight so i'm not gonna
say it's strictly better but it works
with our finances as well
uh which is nice probably a little late
for a poodle
and you have to freeze it here
for for the double buffs to come in
level three turtles still kind of pog
too i don't the octopus is next on the
chopping block but we may not live long
enough it's crazy cool
crazy cool
draw me win me win me
okay six wins
you you have to
we we can make this work
the way it's way too late for you now
but we can sell an octopus
and a mammoth to start farming tier ones
i love the turtle for anti-bat
technology it's probably a little too
late for our scaling to hit but
yo they got the same squad but i think
ours is better like their their micro
makes us be bad oh no but then guess
what
here's three melon armors
no turtle oh you mother
you peace whatever we win we win okay
they didn't believe they didn't believe
it's really hard for me to back out of
this scaling now though with one i i am
like
we could cells but like it's a 16 16
it's actually doing some okay work in
its own right
yes like some food buffs would be nice i
don't think we're gonna get to another
t-rex
but
i suppose
something to be said about giving it a
try
you could garlic your mammoth i'm just
skeptical that you're gonna see it uh
working for you honestly
i i think we're in melon territory which
is why our turtle is so valuable
okay it's a strong creature there
feels good feels good feels bad
feels good
feels good
maybe we could have rolled a caterpillar
it now it's definitely too late but
you know i think you can one-up your
your individual here get get the double
buff on it
we did get our puppy to 50 50 what are
we eight wins
dude this has been a great proof of
concept for us that we can we can go
wild right
like we we lost early in in both of our
games and yet we still made it out of
here feeling pretty solid
i'm playing this in slow-mo because it's
a nasty team i think we still win though
i think we scaled better look at that
we're on nine wins
from early game
andy to late game legend look at this
there's no real need
in theory yes a level three turtle
coming back could give you like uh more
melon armor if you're getting sniped by
i don't know like a
snake or something like that but i don't
even know if the snake exists in the
in the pay to win version
certainly don't need our puppy to pop i
guess if we draw we'll be happy to get
our octopus going a little
a little more
no real need for equipment in a
situation where
um you know we're overriding all of our
equipment with melon armor
it's a spicy team level level three it's
the same squad just they're scaled
better i'll i'll give them that they're
scaled better they are melon armor melon
armor you that you needed to not get us
there i think we got very lucky i we
still lose to the to the rooster there
but hey i recognize you too hey hello
stream sniper
hello
you deliberately made a squad dead
perfectly counters ours by being exactly
the same as ours it's so hard to be a
streamer either way i'm just joking but
hey
nine wins
[Laughter]
pretty good pretty good

hey everybody
welcome back we're playing super auto
pets
i'm sure you're familiar what do we like
we've had two good videos in a row for
sure maybe we'll go back to the free to
play i got a 10 win last night on free
to play on mobile not trying to flex or
whatever
imo you double freeze cricket
it's a it's an audacious and ambitious
reroll you try to re-roll an otter into
a horse
that would have been freaking sick man
that would have been sweet
either way
it's not a particularly strong start but
that's okay i'll be the panicking pants
i've been there
you spill some water uh on your pants
while you're in the bathroom
you're worried everybody's gonna think
that it's a situation where you peed on
them you're trying to mr bean them up
into the hair dryer the hand dryer i
should say
you know how it goes probably um
this is not an amazing start still even
though we won the last round it's a
little funky
it's not necessarily a bad thing though
imo
none of these creatures are long for
this world
so rather than um you know buy an otter
at one two and hope to buff one
admittedly it does get plus one plus one
permanently
yeah i think
well i was gonna say let's take a
mosquito instead
so that it does one damage but then i
was like oh wouldn't you rather just get
plus one plus one but then i'm like ah
but this one's a minus one because it's
a one two but
i think i could be persuaded
to at least give it a try
that's probably the best buff we could
ask for we really so we're gonna level
up to level three on the next turn we we
have a squad that still is uh
in flux right now and consists merely of
like decent stuff
uh it's not too too bad
like our beaver's gonna do some serious
work here we're actually gonna win this
one um i i'm just gonna level with you i
think we've gotten really lucky we've
been against squads that are
also getting some cursed shops so i'm
very grateful for that
uh we will
you could possibly roll we did that so
badly
you could possibly roll the shrimp
i'm not fully sold though
you know what i am actually i think i am
fully sold
we're gonna buy and buy
then two cells takes us to six
we don't need to do two cells though we
could do for example one cell
with the beaver buff
it's not too bad three five is pretty
spicy
and then
depends how you want to sort this out
let's do a cell we we love that buff and
then i think we're going to do a buy on
the otter nonetheless which we could
have combined admittedly but we would
have missed the cell trigger for a
little bit and then a a buy on a
hedgehog as well
i really i don't love this squad but i
think for round three it's okay
um being able to live through three fish
attacks actually or two fish attacks
here is doing some great stuff for this
uh level two cricket
i'm not trying to flex at all this is a
squad that should not be
uh
three and oh right now or three and one
no it's three and oh man that's crazy um
you you can do buy sell with the shrimp
i think we'd rather
it's taken me a long time to learn this
but i feel like the shrimp does better
when you just sell
it last in a group of things that you
definitely do want to get rid of
um
instead of like building your whole run
around buying and selling
you may disagree but
um
it kind of sucks because like i think a
crab could almost work here just just
give it a moment so the otter is
basically useless
the porcupine we can sell
two seven three six and you're gonna
buff at the start of battle you copy
health
i think we can afford to put one crab
out here we don't need two
although technically you could insert
one i guess right there looking for
something a little bit more um like
productive
now usually you you can roll camel into
peacock it's not incredible
but it's okay
and i
we're really looking for like a well you
know what we want to do we want to hit a
level two on the next turn and then get
an early like tier four unit um
like an early hippo or something
something we can build a run around
because we're not really there yet
it's surprisingly like
is going better than it should be going
[Laughter]
like like i i'm stunned that we are four
uh four and oh right now but i don't
know maybe uh
maybe another youtuber started playing
the game or something and and you know
we're we're lucky to be in this position
i don't really know um
you know maybe there's a maybe it's like
christmas day on call of duty like
there's a surprising amount of new
players here
uh i i think we can invest
to be honest i i almost believe that
there's a chance we could make like a
dog work here like if you if you commit
to getting rid of
either your cricket or your peacock for
a little bit um
or actually probably both for a little
bit i think you can get something going
on here
um like we'll we'll start by selling
the uh peacock and this is
temporarily bad
for sure
but in the service of getting something
really good going on this dog long term
i'm gonna stick with that camel because
it's a 210 which is awesome
then we can play you here which will
summon
you here i think you can freeze this
crap i know we sold one earlier they
can't take the buff away from us
um
technically i would love to freeze you
get melon armor on you which will free
up your spot here we'll put a crab out
there it'll be a 310 that gets buffed
over time dog's getting a little
stronger we're never going to level up
this shrimp we're happy to see it where
it stands
we really want a tier four we're
insanely blessed to be in the position
we're in
just to be
the one billion percent straight up with
you um
you are gonna kill us
and i think you're gonna kill our crab
which is pretty yeah that's the end of
the line for this
i think we pivoted at the right time
that that monkey build is very scary as
well so what do we do now pill you this
frees up some space for us which is
lovely sell the crab
beautiful
uh we will
but you know buy an otter
and then sell an otter
we got plus one from the dog summon
plus one plus one from the otter
plus one plus zero plus one from the
cell
and then i know you're like i've gone
cross side and then
one gold back so for two gold that's a
pretty good value we can temporarily
roll a kangaroo or maybe permanently
roll a kangaroo um
i mean for the time being
i would love if a dodo worked here but
i'm not i'm not totally sold on the idea
that it does
uh un until we level it up which we're
not at yet so i would say buy an otter
knowing that it has like upside in the
future i don't know if we're gonna keep
a shrimp
and i i would say we're probably not
gonna get a second shrimp so we're we're
in a very vulnerable position right now
i i still we we've inevitably some
people are gonna be like i think you've
skipped over some possibly like
incredible options and that may well be
true
um
but i i feel like we've
we ran with a good thing until it ran
out
wow
we lose this which is staggering to me
it was just a very nice assortment of
sheeps you got there you know you don't
disrespect the power of the sheep
now we sell
get a reward
for one gold effectively we get a
either either an attack or health on our
dog and then a health on somebody else
lovely and we'll do the exact same thing
here
this we we love to see it man bison will
not work for us
we got to do something it's too late
for the giraffe we need something
much more ambitious i think
i mean this is a great buy sell i hate
to say it it is
are we are we really committing to this
build here's the thing okay
i don't really want to commit to this
nightmare we got going on here
but the flip side of it for real
is like i don't know what else we do
it's not like we've had anything show up
in in my opinion at least that really
like
uh
you know would change the way that we
would approach this
this is a this is uh don't even there
should be a resign button because this
squad here is just too strong
like
we're barely going to lose but still
like that that's just a horrible squad
to run up against i had a feeling this
was going to happen the chickens are
coming home to roost okay so that's big
um this is
big
give me a buy me sell me
we're still committed to the idea that
this dog could get us there
lovely give me a buy me
and then a sell me
i mean it's a 816 dog man this there's
nothing wrong with that
all of these are just pure garbage um
give me give me a dolphin coming out
here at least giving us a little bit of
efficacy you don't like to see five base
tier units but this is the folly of the
buy sell build
okay
we really need our kangaroo that thank
you
as long as our kangaroo finishes the job
here we're not sweating it too bad
this looks actually pretty good
i'm i'm a little surprised that somehow
this is gonna be like a positive win
rate uh start
but we're here we are here
the dolphin is likely to be sold but we
need
something like we need something better
[Laughter]
oh you know what you can do okay so you
can sell a dolphin
this can't be economical like this is
getting silly
um
should put us on five okay buy some
canned food
buy a swan
sell a swan
roll a scorpion up at the front at some
point we're gonna want to sell a shrimp
um
i think it's been okay for us to be
honest with you but obviously we've got
a long way to go
this is really bad our camel matches up
poorly with theirs oh yeah like
especially because theirs is a level two
we go pretty hard here though
and then we get got pretty hard
i you know though look at this six wins
okay i mean if we got to like eight this
would be a pretty spectacular
success story um
so i think as
look the shrimp's gotta go but it
doesn't have to go first you can sell
your kangaroo it's a four seven it's a
little late for that to still be pumping
you can sell uh or you can buy a hippo
we really wanna try to roll a hippo
maybe behind our camel for now because
we'll get nice buffs on it
which means are we going to be rolling a
scorpion
possibly yes okay so maybe now's the
time
you sell your shrimp which still gives
you the space to summon for your dog
we do have a seven nine blowfish that's
not too bad
um
maybe it just feels a little late for
this rabbit build for me
so we get the benefit on the buy but not
so much on the cell side this time why
don't you roll me
instead
i really do want a level two hippo
call me crazy here i i think a level two
hip uh we can try this yes
yes we can
i feel like a a level two hippo that's
way too much frozen but
uh actually we don't need the blowfish
anymore we're probably gonna lose here
with our four squad i knew i was
committed to rolling the four as soon as
we bought the hippo but
let's just see
let's just see
are you living
not really
yeah we we lose these it was actually
pretty close okay honestly would we get
six on that one six on that given our
start and our uh finish that was pretty
good
you don't need a duck i've i've come
like full circle on the duck builds to
be honest with you i i think they can
work
maybe the extra tentacles man
very common medical problem
um i've come full circle on the duck i
was like i don't respect them then i
used them a little more and i was like i
don't respect anything but them now i'm
like ah hey jerome powell
nice to see you
it's a saturday i was gonna say
shouldn't you be busy but it's a
saturday um this is a great start on the
other hand here though roll me
don't freeze anything
i i totally think you can make ducks
work but in the early game ants crickets
and fish
are are the that's how you win the game
imo at least
back buff please thank you so much thank
you so much for the back buff
we win these because of the dirty rat
and the cricket i guess yet another
reason that it the rat
look i've seen it work a couple of times
but
okay
qriket me
the camel was not our problem last time
on round three if you can make a dog
work i think you make a dog work
um
and then i think you combine your ants
you can always freeze the snail in the
flex position i think
then we'll roll
uh a camel
i think we should roll a camel that
maybe buffs a swan
freeze that dog for sure we were
way early like certainly early enough
to buy cell to get our dog to a good
level now what mistake from last time
would i like to rectify this time
it would be uh very oh let's go dude
it would be very very nice
to
uh get garlic on our dog as soon as
possible
great start by the way this is beautiful
i actually think it's too late for a
horse
so i i think uh you know given these two
and we we also like the ant is good to
be fair but we're gonna start clearing
to to make our units a little stronger
now i think you sell the cricket first
because the swan is uh it gives us the
gold which is nice but it's also closer
to a level up which is worth a lot for
us we are fishing for like a pill as
well
so we can pill the ant and then put
stuff in instead you can totally uh run
a spider
it's not exceptional
but if it it can give you some
exceptional things if it gives you a
sheep or a turtle you're usually pretty
pleased
let's see very similar squads here when
it gives you a giraffe you're uh
markedly less pleased
hey man as long as we're not dying on
this hit i'm a happy man and we end up
pulling out a draw here it's a draw with
scaling which is a moral victory
again we need to get rid of something
this is your easy one you're gonna get
rid of the ants it's a nice buff on a
camel that we're gonna keep for the time
being
um we can go like this mostly these are
for dog buffs we do want our next like
our dog to
get to a nice level here
so this is three gold
for
three stats
spread out that's actually like
economically i was gonna unsell it i was
i was gonna be like i'm not sold on it
anymore but this kind of sold me
and i will also say again this is just
economically speaking
um given the situation we find ourselves
in here i think we can do okay with
something like that like five gold is a
is a buy sell buy territory if you've
got
some kind of scaling factor associated
with it
look can i tell you something as well a
lot a lot of people would maybe take
issue with this to a small extent but oh
come on man that's that's nasty
um
don't don't get the dog man that's all i
asked level two blowfish this early
pretty spooky man
i think we're still looking okay though
look at that um
rolling too much is an obvious error
but there's also an error to be found
when you roll too little you know when
you spend your gold at like exactly the
the margins people are like wow what an
economical way to play the game and it's
true but you don't see what you didn't
get from the roles that you didn't do
you know what i mean
that in and of itself is is somewhat
insidious
you can have a whale that eats a spider
you know it's not like we have a monkey
or anything doing some sick buffs right
now we can totally um
like are we gonna dump a spider
i think for now
like the spider is not good
but we need something that gets eaten i
guess you could summon some dirty rats
that would be a weird way to play the
game but um
we don't want to level up the dog quite
yet so maybe you can sell the spider
summon something
because we're trying to get the summon
triggers or alternatively uh yeah okay
you can sell this uh i mean this is just
really good you sell the spider you get
a camel close to the next level the
camel's been fine for us
um you could have the camel buff the dog
to be honest with you like we could do
it like that then you freeze the turtle
roll once
freeze the garlic
buy the turtle we love some melon armor
we get an extra buff there
next turn i don't know next turn we
might be selling the swan unless we can
level them up
selling the swan makes space to continue
getting these summon triggers on the dog
which is is worth something man this
is gonna be
freaky it's gonna be nasty okay
but
we we own you
that's pretty bad okay i mean honestly
is it it's a nice squad
what do we have four four two four one
that's pretty good so we did get the
swan leveled up
i hate to say it but for now we can get
another turtle later
and then you can
swan me
swan me
dog me
phrasing maybe
uh
we need garlic on dog or camel
so you're gonna buy an animal
and the best animal for us
uh
there's no animal that does well when it
gets eaten here like this this kind of
sucks
we need that garlic though man
end of turn copy the level one a bit you
know what the best play imo
you put whale at the front you create a
parrot that temporarily becomes a level
one swan
gives us a little uh summoning power
here
we have something loading in the
background on windows whale at the front
is always a bit of a brazen build you
don't want to see uh your meme build
versus golden poop that's like it's one
of the the true nightmares but you know
what you knew what could happen there we
were we were in a transition period
so this is an easy sell
uh
we could
dump this whale
and then start rolling like a hippo at
the front like we could sell we got 15
gold buy
try to do it like this so we get the
full like benefit of the order
um
88 bison is not bad but we don't have
the the payoff for it
i mean i still think
like i think your camel's still a bigger
payoff for you here
it's weird freeze me again
the one thing that's really good the one
thing i will say right now is we have
we're lucky
we have two life to play with so losing
this round which is very plausible to me
uh doesn't seem that bad we are going up
against two level one dodos which is
actually just a great sign
um that we're going up against somebody
who they themselves is also like
transitioning from one build to another
this is you couldn't really ask for more
on this one
um we we got lucky with our opponent's
election and guaranteed ourselves a
positive win rate for the episode which
is nice
now
i still like the camel with some melon
armor i think the time has come like the
turtle's great the melon armor is worth
so much now so i think you sell
your uh
your swan we might sell the turtle i'd
rather pill it but let's let's can up
by
with this much life to live it's very
hard for me to not double can
i love it actually so we're now we're
creating amazing units
[Laughter]
we might not live long enough to deploy
them
but we are creating some amazing units
level one dota with a kangaroo at the
back we killed their hippo that's big
for us
our dog is
he's gonna do some work
it's gonna do oh we're gonna lose to the
freaking dodo by
we're gonna draw with the freaking dodo
that's a huge save for us because having
this hp to play with it it matters a lot
for now i will i'll pay three for garlic
i'll pay three for garlic
we would like our dog to get stronger
um
at some point we're looking for a pill
on this turtle right so
i i think you freeze the dog
and you
buff
the hippo in the hopes of scaling it a
little faster dude i would kill for some
chocolate for this camel too but i don't
know maybe it's too late for that camel
like uh this squad loses unless the the
hippo goes freaking wild
like our squad loses unless the hippo
goes wild
we're gonna lose to the dog presumably
yeah
why did i put garlic on the camel what
what are we doing here
you know what we're not doing that bad i
think we're
we're lucky we're not going up against
the squad that had a turtle
we still
draw
yeah
like i i think maybe the camel has has
served his purpose
round 11 this is great timing so in that
case let's get rid of the camel we
respect that it's time has come
buff i mean the buff here actually makes
the scaling work better
we get a disproportionate benefit from
that
cat giving double food effects is is
kind of sick
to be honest
um
it doesn't
and i know we just put garlic on you but
like the melon that would we we
understood that well you know what
actually never mind because we
definitely want to not buff the turtle
um
i think
we we buy you honestly
you're a 14 15 to begin with obviously
you buff us nicely we don't really care
for a one up right now
um
you know truth be told this probably
works better for us
because you already have garlic we're
gonna keep this dog around
really
like it's getting late we're really
looking for
some oh my god it's a nightmare
how'd your flamingo get so strong
the the double monkey man that's so good
okay well that we knew that was coming
that that's just the squad with some
absolutely
disastrous scaling
um
i know we should be buying food
we can't commit to the scaling yet but
we we really can't buy the dog like we
we have some we have some issues here
sal is just not that good
i guess
freeze me
freeze me
and for now
buy me because i'm scared
um
i
and freeze me i'm thinking like okay if
we draw out somehow
tiger behind cat equals like quadrupled
effects oh that's real nasty for us
but they don't have too much going on
after this but can i also add the
obvious we don't okay we lose that hurts
because like
i i actually think we could have made a
like a cat
uh tiger build work but it is it is what
it is we didn't do very well there i
think we had two five fours it's a
winning
ratio in a game that continually gets
harder every single day but hey
it happens let me know what you would
have done differently in the comments
because especially on some of those i
was like i don't know where we're going
didn't they got a monkey round 11 and
then you're like let's try um but apart
from that thanks for watching i'll see
you next time and thanks for all the
support on super auto pets see you then



hey everybody welcome back to super auto
pad so don't mean to boot boast i don't
mean to brag
um but uh last night on the android
version you might have gone to sleep
with the 2
10 streak going on not 210 wins in a row
um but uh
two ten win runs in a row and you know
what made both of them tick
dragon
you get like i got a new flow chart for
10 wins you gotta do well in the early
game what does that require
on free to play
a horse maybe two horses
you're not going to keep it long term
but for for a little bit
an ant a fish
two mosquitoes two crickets something
like that okay you get into the mid game
you want to get a scaling unit like a
dog
that you can buy sell buy sell him me
him me
you do well with that you give them all
equipment
sell your worst unit for a dragon as
soon as possible if you get the chance
then you're just flipping then you're
day trading you get 350 50s you win on
turn 12.
now i'm not promising that's what's
gonna happen here
i'm just saying that's that's where my
head's at right now okay this is a good
start
this is the kind of start you can't
complain about we got the
tropical teapots obviously
anytime you get alliteration it's like a
plus 200 to your team's overall elo
we are against a squad that's not that
good
not that good
not that good i don't know why i'm
playing so slow right here okay
round one mission accomplished now we're
looking for some pairs that's that's a
pair
roll me roll me once
this is not great
this is not ideal but because of our
crickets i think you can roll one horse
now you could combine
this is like the one situation where i'm
not totally sold on that instead i'm
gonna make i'm gonna make the the
decision you should never make which is
uh spending three gold on a one one
when we could have gotten like a one two
or a two two with upside but okay this
is horrible uh this is just a nast it's
one of the nastiest squads you're ever
going to see in your life
[Laughter]
my hope is that maybe
it's one of those situations oh my god
we're actually gonna we're gonna win
yeah okay it turns out there's too much
of a good thing when it comes to ants i
didn't know what could happen but you do
need some payoff units so i guess we'll
consider ourselves lucky for now
now this is a tricky situation you can
definitely combine and then roll one
extra horse you can freeze a pill to
make some space via the ant i'm not sold
on the dodo quite yet
it's not to say it's bad i'm just not
sold on it yet this will be a combine
and then hope for a top-tier uh tier
three unit
yeah that's really good it possibly the
best tier three unit i would say why
don't you go ahead and get out there now
we got a 4-2 sheep
with with some cricket upside next time
this is a squad that you know my my many
hours of super auto pets tells me has a
really good chance of at least hanging
in there maybe not winning every round
but
looking looking pretty strong
from a from a draw perspective at worst
maybe right now
i don't know the the squad we're going
up against is is fairly nasty itself
i feel like we lose by one
yeah we lose by one attack but honestly
they had a good team
it is what it is we're still building
i'll go level two ant
um although technically if you're gonna
go level two and it makes more sense to
do it
next turn to tear up one level
and you know what
i'm i'm willing
so we'll get a nice
4-1
let's make it into a 5-2
roll
i'm keeping this i'm keeping this okay
i don't know what to say
[Laughter]
i don't know i don't know what to say
about this sand i think we freeze you
roll once
we can put a b
throw some bees on it we can throw a b
on a sheep it's a little weird um but
considering we have a level two horse
that's basically like three extra damage
we got the capacity for it right now
kangaroo a little spooky here behind
this fairly tanky crab
but i think it's only it's only gonna
get to attack twice
so you're getting strong but you're not
getting that strong and then at the end
of this all you got is two little
shrimps back there
no sweat
okay we're definitely into the mid game
we would love to see
an acceleration of gameplay
with a high quality unit
that's not really it
now we're one ant away from a level
three so unfreeze this for now
this is a weird one i'm not in the
position i want to be in but with three
wins one loss
it's just it's just unusual okay this is
not the way you would typically want to
build into this
it's a slightly scary squad but i think
we actually match up kind of okay
i mean they have a snail out there they
do have a dog out there don't get me
wrong but oh do you peace
it makes me so freaking mad man when the
spider pays out with the sheep
okay that that's gonna put us in a
position that is much less uh
functional and yet would you look at
this we still come out with a win even
though they got the rng of their dreams
so we're still hanging definitely
nothing to complain about maybe you can
freeze one of these now
we can go up a level or start to think
about going up a level on a sheep we
need to
we need to get better
like because this squad is not gonna
get us 10 wins
continue rolling
that's this is great stuff okay
we can always combine here by the way
and run one more
uh creature
while we have hp to play with i'm gonna
be the world's
scariest coward okay
we're gonna make a six five level two
ant that's one away we're gonna roll
just the one extra cricket that's
actually gonna be nice as a 3-2
what this allows us to do is take on a
relative risk of increased chance of
losing this round
um and the benefit associated with that
is on our next round we'll get a combine
that allows us to jump one tier ahead
which i actually think is quite uh
amazing
a badger huh
i think that the badger is not that
good for us
that was gonna say bad for us and i
regretted it immediately but i think we
come away with a draw
which is all we could ask for after we
made like a meta play like this
you can't be too upset
this is incredible
so you're gonna it's too late for the
dog in in my experience we're gonna
do this
you're not good enough
um we need to make space on our
roster here
so roll me once
then combine me again
now a turkey
is possibly like the best unit in the
game
turkey tiger
fly like we got something going on here
we got many spawns that are happening we
can definitely afford to dump our horse
in the future because this is i mean the
turkey is basically just a strictly
better version of the horse um
this is some great stuff
we really don't have a benefit from uh
much here
like you can
stand up something with a pair but like
are you really
are you really that sold on it like the
ant is gonna get pilled even though it's
pretty good um
the ant is going to be pilled because
this plus six plus three is more
valuable on another unit so i mean what
do you give stats to the cricket's
likely to stick around you know what the
sheep is probably the most likely to
stick around for now so i i really like
this squad now we need
equipment um for sure but i mean the
turkey is just so good and a fly once we
can get tier 6 units then we're starting
to talk for sure but
um this kangaroo is not that scary man
it's it's just not because we're we're
spitting out a 7-5 like
every time we spawn a unit and we're
spawning units constantly
i almost like genuinely feel bad because
this is like this is pretty oh my god we
drew are you kidding me
this is like the meta build you don't
want to run up against but you know when
you get it you get it right like you
just gotta embrace it
so we'll start here
i mean i
to be honest i think you can actually
sell a horse first it's a spicy play but
it's not a good scaling unit in the late
game then we roll a rooster which is
part of the build that we want here this
gives us a chance to buff the rooster
that's not how it worked out we got a
4-4 b we're probably likely to sell
yeah we'll sell for one you can
definitely just pop a second cricket out
there
and i mean
if if we're being straight up with one
another you could definitely pop this as
well
roll to fish for another qriket you can
freeze a a snail you can freeze some
garlic maybe
this is fine um the double cricket play
is a little weird i'll admit but
it you know we we get great scaling from
units uh oh gold and poop would you look
at that they're very spooky um
this is this is pretty nasty
it's a good squad and then they've also
got this double uh monkey build going
here like garlic just crushes us and
that kangaroo is gonna go wild this this
should be a loss
that kangaroo is gonna is gonna body us
so we'll be looking to add a fly into
the rotation here
it's just a really good team you can't
really be upset
so we'll combine
seven eight cricket
scaling factor
i mean a five five snail you can keep it
there for a second
see if you get something better um
i mean the most valuable upgrade is
definitely going to be to our rooster
i think you could i think what you got
to do is to sell
buy
my chocolate you fool every time but
like we weren't missing a level up off
of that chocolate
maybe it's not that bad it's certainly
not that good
are you really gonna roll an ant here
and be like i'm a genius i don't think
so
i mean to be honest
for the time being it totally screws up
our positioning but you could roll a
second turkey out there you'll lose like
a b in the process or you could also buy
a snail don't get me wrong but i think
this is this is at least humorous and if
things go wrong we'll be happy to have a
snail
um
we want to roll into some squads yeah no
no golden poops it's a nasty dodo but we
actually do really well against that
tiger dodo because we don't have like
one strong unit we have
a lot of pretty strong units that are
gonna just just take you down here so
that went totally fine what are we up to
now as five wins this squad can go ten
we gotta handle it properly but it can
go ten
looks something like this
i don't know why i thought like the
combination might work better this way
but gorilla's really good um
is it a fit for this squad i would say
not necessarily i would say that for the
time being you can roll a shark at the
back here
again it pushes us into a position that
maybe is not perfect but
um
i want some scaling we don't have any
scaling right now that's okay
let's get a permanent buff on the the
rooster tends to do the best we're on
round 10 we're going to start to roll
into some very scary squads long term we
want to dump a shark for a fly i think
um
again we we should do the garlic armor
is nasty here
yeah this this could be a little spooky
because the blowfish has some serious
upside
don't hit my shark man don't hit my
shark you hit the shark every time
are you are you kidding me man
we we're one away from a draw like one
life away from a draw on that one what
can you do you run into like the most
incredible
um
plays from uh from a blowfish you ever
see sometimes you just get out played
man we're gonna keep you around so we
might as well give you a quick little
steak
i do not see a fly
i'm a huge believer like in this squad
i i think you apple me man
i don't think this is a five win squad
okay i think this is this is like an
eight win squad we just need to get
there
level two uh rooster little spooky but
as long as we get to our rooster first
i'm not i'm not that upset this hedgehog
is kind of uh
it's kind of scary huh
i think we lose
i think we
i think we draw
i think we win never mind okay that was
a very weird build but it almost got us
it's a roll
i mean
i don't a level three turkey
we should at least entertain the thought
so i genuinely think that the dragon
might be the best unit in the game
the only reason i'm not taking it along
for the ride with us here is because
we're not running a scaling build it's
not even that it's too late it's just
that we're like
this i i normally don't do this in this
game but we're running much uh wider
instead of deep uh which is gonna lose
us here because this kangaroo is gonna
be like lights out but i still you know
what it was this was a six win run
i have to tell you maybe it's a positive
thing to be looking at six wins and be
like i'm a little disappointed
we lost to some builds that you should
pay attention to we lost to some builds
that had one
super tanky unit with like great scaling
um
it's respectable man there's no
disrespect you know you you punch
through those first two units the rest
of the squad is made of tissue paper but
uh we we didn't punch through those
first two units again it just shows you
i think we're in a scaling meta right
now
you can roll this is a rare circumstance
where i think an otter is okay depending
on your roll
you want to make sure you get that 3-4
this is a bad starting squad but it's
okay
what the heck is a fuss pot man i'm
going to be the tropical heads
you know it's like the if the talking
heads release like uh a beach boys style
album
we win okay
you can't really control the value of
your early shop you just gotta just
gotta accept it okay so this is weird i
i will always stand by the value of an
early horse
you're gonna freeze me roll me
we don't we this is weird we need to
keep one spot open okay so we're gonna
do it like this the buffs are horrible
like we this is not how we wanted it to
pan out but keep in mind even though the
buffs are kind of bad three four three
four three three is like a it's a pretty
nasty squad to run up against early
now we're rolling up against the squad
that is like almost exactly the same so
we are going to lose this one but they
got a they had a good team they had a
good team
maybe their hat upsets me but they had a
good team so
we start with the level up
there's
this might not be as bad as it appears
to be
um
so we like to double sell
you like the fish
roll me
i'm gonna go for a combine
i'm gonna freeze a cricket roll once
you know qriket's good i think that the
spider gives you
uh a better chance
like if you get sheep or turtle
which seems to happen to my opponents
quite a lot but i guess that's probably
just some form of observed bias
we we do seem to be getting a lot of
snails but look at that we ended up
coming out of this looking pretty good
that's two wins
uh we we should level
we could pill you and get a
a tier three unit but i'm not sold on
that being advisable
we don't want to combine yet if we can
avoid it like we'd rather uh
like we'd rather avoid the level i guess
until the next round up and i stand by
it i i genuinely do
except
now i'm like that's not right
because now that i see that we have the
potentiality of getting a dog out here
on turn four
i'm a believer in the dog's ability to
thrive
and personally
if we're being realistic
this otter is not long for the this
world
i think you love getting an ox out here
which allows the dog to get buffed the
ox gets a temporary buff then i think
you can totally pill the spider
which will buff our ox because there's a
unit in front and it will buff our dog
because another unit got summoned and i
guess it temporarily buffs the blowfish
too okay
um then believe it or not i'm like i
think you freeze the spider freeze a
pill to do something similar next turn
like we're getting some serious buffs
out of this
it's a very strange squad we're keeping
the fish exclusively for the scaling
level up and the blowfish is not long
for this world this is not that kind of
tropical builds
the the the tropical heads this this is
not my beautiful beach
anyway uh this is going really well
that's gonna be a win we're playing the
shops that we've been dealt and i think
it's the way you got to do it
sheep totally fits this build so we'll
start with a cell
even though a pill works nicely we're
going to do it like this we're going to
buy you
love to see it
pill you
a whale that eats things can be a
reasonable part of a build like this
people don't like to hear it but i don't
mind selling
our fish
to roll
a sheep in front you get one less sheep
trigger than you'd like but later on
we'll consider selling our horse to move
our sheep further back or maybe we'll
get rid of an ox or something it does
well to scale the dog like the fish it
only gives plus one plus one on the
level up so
i'm a believer in
this but i want to see if we get a pill
because if we get a pill i prefer and
and i don't even want to think about our
expenditures here but i prefer
something like this
i got to tell you a turtle is really
good
i think a turtle is is good enough that
we hold the sheep for now and we put
some garlic armor on our dog
and i'm i'm a big fan of what we got
going on here admittedly we have like
overdone melon armor on our ox but we we
hit the ox with that not just for the
melon armor but for the extra uh damage
buff as well so the whale does nicely
with you know with our dog here this
still looks pretty bad
yeah because that that horse is so
strong we we just draw i think we got a
little lucky on the draw to begin with
but i'm i'm still like there's no reason
to disbelieve this squad right now i
think
we'll roll we're really
just to be honest with you we're looking
for a pill
i'm willing to roll
deeper than you'd expect maybe
okay that's about as deep as i'm willing
to go um let's get this aux going a
little stronger
roll me once then give me a pill
guaranteed no okay well all's forgiven
very inefficient shop but we we did
improve somewhat
i understand the the people do not like
this order because here's the thing
people they focus on on what you lose
like is it mathematically the right
decision to have uh
you know to get one less trigger out of
our sheep
you might be like no but oh it's almost
crashed there it looked like
but the answer is maybe
it actually might be
mathematically the best option
it just might look bad
it happens all the time you got to get
yours well fool i got to get mine
everything is fine when you're hanging
with the dog he's got the cultivating
music that'd be captivating he who
listened i think is how it goes now we
need to make space for our dog to get
buffed okay
we would like a can
so i think we have come to the point
where
a horse needs to be sold in order to
make space for our dog i know that the
horse is like part of this build in a
big way but if our dog is gonna scale
we need to get something going like this
uh and and the order is not okay well
hold on now you pretty much have to
freeze these two units
um i have to think about it even a
penguin can be really good if we get the
levels but we're far away from those
right now
it's really hard to make a monkey whale
build work but we should actually in my
opinion start this uh this hippo is
gonna go freaking wild on us man
um
maybe it's gonna go
we're gonna get ahead of it
slightly faster than expected but we're
going to lose to the other units behind
but oh my god because
this is we this is not the build you
want to run into after you had the horse
um after you sold the horse i should say
but
look you're gonna pivot off of that
horse at some point
i think what i'm trying to say here is
that it's time for the whale to
not be here anymore
this is a nasty pivot you got to be
you got to be sure this is what you want
we know we're gonna want roosters
especially because we bought cans
so we'll try to summon them like this
so that we get the the dog effect and
then we'll try to buff the rooster
because the rooster gets an incredible
benefit out of it um
we're so close to what you would assume
is a level up
uh honestly just take some meat for now
it's it's a little weird but um it's
more than a little weird i'm i've lost
confidence in this squad
but we're going up against the squad
that at least
right out of the gates
doesn't scare me that much a level one
turtle
admittedly it's a little spicy but
you know i we're cutting through you
pretty good here
we draw we we should have won that like
i mean not once we started the auto
battle that's pretty much like
guaranteed
but
are we possibly at a point
we're in that dangerous position right
now where like i feel like we can't sell
anything but we need to sell something
to make space
i think you can
i was gonna say i think you sell the
sheep
i love the sheep okay i take no pride in
this
we're being forced to make some
difficult decisions
a scaling rhino can do something i'm not
saying we're gonna roll this long term
i'm just saying i'm happy enough with
what that looked like
that we could do it and then immediately
i'm like get sold
um
and get get bought
and
you can roll a deer here possibly this
is it's messed up man next turn we're
getting some levels up like we're gonna
go up against some tier sixes here we're
we're floundering a little bit but you
know turkey at the front
is this allowed
level this is a bad squad i think i
think we just got very lucky
that we happen to be rolling against
like
well i don't know now i'm looking at it
and i'm like we might no we're gonna win
but that that's just a weird one okay
we're five wins the above average gamer
continues
you gotta you got a turkey up i know we
got chocolate as well
uh tiger turkey
certainly certainly
means you can sell either a dog or a
root or an ox
um
i think you sell your dog
i don't really believe in the ox long
term but
the dog is not quite there either i
prefer the the built-in melon armor
now
you're gonna take the level up here but
maybe not yet because we'd rather have a
tiger coming out
we gotta rebuild this whole freaking
squad okay so we start with tiger monkey
but that's only for the time being
you're gonna get a level up and then
we're gonna rework this entire squad
to be spawns okay
which means because you're getting plus
six plus we're going to sell the ox
and then we're going to roll
a deer we're going to roll it in the
second position because we want to make
sure we're getting permanent buffs on
our rooster
uh
i think it's certainly possible that i
have lost my mind we lose to anything
tanky or anything that goes wide
that's bad
on the other hand here's where the party
starts welcome to the party pal
get crushed
wow okay that was easier than expected
six wins
this is a fun run too because it's i
mean it's just very weird
[Laughter]
i i think we're probably at the point
where you don't need
the monkey anymore even though the
monkey scaling is great we have a
different kind of run going on right now
so you move your rooster to the back so
it spawns four
turkey here
deer here is fine and then you just
think about how we're gonna how we're
gonna make this work we want a fly
that's that's really like if we could
roll
deep and get to a fly i think i would be
happy
i also think there's no reason
even though 99 is a great stat here
there's no reason not to run a whale on
this build
and then we'll probably just
buy a freezer turkey
and then roll it another turkey out here
so the real you know ps the resistance
is our four 15 15 roosters that we
create unless we get sniped
this is great actually does a great job
of purging that melon armor
two roosters okay at least he kills both
and this is where things will get
interesting
admittedly we don't get the turkey buff
on all these but so be it i mean did you
see that it just that went pretty wild
um
this is hilarious like i don't know man
maybe i guess we'll try to get to a
level three turkey
we really want to fly
i don't think i've ever seen a level
three turkey
which makes me think it's not that good
straight up i'm like this is a freeze
double roll
we don't well you could freeze no
because we want chocolate if it shows up
i think you freeze a rooster
well no you know what let's unfreeze a
pair instead of getting plus two plus
two let's get plus one plus one plus
some experience and then if we can get a
level three rooster we can put the
rooster at the back
uh and then use our tiger on something
else this tiger snake is like
is really nasty
that's horrible
on the bright side hey we did get the
turkey buff on the on the rooster
jesus
this is is that's just a nasty squad man
like that that tiger snake did some
incredible work you got to respect it
this is exactly what we wanted to see
okay
so um you need to run fly at the back
unfortunately right now that pushes our
turkey too far forward
so you gotta look at
you don't want turkey fly
you know what you can do okay
you can roll
or you don't want tiger fly you can roll
tiger turkey
fly might as well be at the very back
sell me
by me
this is okay
we have a very weak squad
tiger doesn't level up by the way so
you're just buying it for stats which
could be fine but
um
in general i think that's gonna be our
best option even though the odds of this
unit
living uh through even one hit is
relatively low we're not gonna level up
the deer so this is our hail mary i
think this could be an eight nine ten
win game but we gotta
you know it's gotta be the perfect
scenario there goes our melon armor
at least they don't have tiger snake
this time
you peace
you peace
this rhino's gotta go
after the rhino goes
now we can start to be like okay
be careful who you call ugly in middle
school
we come out of this with a win okay
never never a doubt in my mind that
takes us to eight
eight is where i start to feel like it's
kind of impressive
we do have a problem like a level three
rooster actually is like not that good
because we can't fit it and there's
really no place to i think at least to
rework these units what you could do
though
you could roll a level one rooster at
the front a five well so we have a nine
nine when it dies it makes a five five
with splash damage
i no this this unfreeze me level two is
as good as it gets we can't we can't
augment our squad that much
we'd like something that's not a deer up
at the front even though the deer is
doing okay
something with like some more raw stats
potential even could
could get there like even a one-up is
not that good a turtle you already have
melon armor so
melon armor is is not that big of a deal
i think
uh on on these units because we're not
really trying to create like one
uh super strong unit that can't be
killed
i mean you can obviously cow and then
buff the rooster but
i'm i'm kind of like floating here i i
don't really know where i want to go
with this
get some double splash damage for
anti-melon protection
this has been a puzzle man this has been
a real puzzle we don't do that badly
against uh squads with high attack
because we spawn a lot of units
that was just perfect math you love to
see it this beautiful oh my god
that was not even close so we're at nine
wins this could be a 10 win
wow
it's it's not like that surprising but
um
i i think that the chili might work
better here believe it or not
than the melon i don't know what we're
doing with chocolate we're just kind of
just
sitting on it
there is a theory maybe where like rhino
can come in here and do some work but
i can already see myself just
essentially rolling that infant item the
only other thing i would say is that i
feel like a scorpion
to get like a guaranteed kill is better
but this is going to be divisive
which is why i like it
but
okay we got one
last roll
sure
a little meat on our turkey we'd love to
just kill a strong unit at the front
with no melon
holy crap it's gonna work that that's
just the dream um i don't know if we're
gonna come through this one but we're
we're looking okay that that europe dude
we're gonna do it i i'm stunned but look
at this look at this
i don't know if it was the scorpion that
made it possible but that is that's a
10-win game right there
so now three of my last four games 10
wins
thanks for watching hope you've enjoyed
it uh that i'm kind of proud of that one
admittedly like tiger turkey fly rooster
is pretty meta but i'm kind of proud of
it just because like
you know i was talking about how we were
gonna roll dragon and penguin scaling we
didn't get there and yeah we pivoted and
made it work exciting for now thanks for
watching hope you've enjoyed it if you
did click the like button thanks for all
the support on super auto pets so far in
the beta and i'll see you next time see
ya



hey everybody the lord of spelunky is
back
had a nice 10 win last time can't
complain
you lie you sit on a throne of lies when
you say new animals but you know what
has been a bit since we rolled expansion
it's tough this is like your nightmare
shop okay this is like the queen's
gambit that you do do you accept or do
you decline taking pigs puts you at a
disadvantage long term
well short term
um
2-2 with no upside except for sale is
not good enough to hang in there on the
early rounds anymore imo
but
if you can get an early third one it
does give you an enhanced chance of
getting a level up by turn three which
skips you ahead of tier i think you
either buy two pigs or you buy one
cricket reroll i'm i'm just gonna be
honest with you i'm a cricket reroll
kind of guy
this is a a pretty bad start here
but it is what it is we'll be the um
backwards bagpipes
how does that sound does that sound okay
sounds okay to me
this is real nasty
yeah this is a loss
[Laughter]
you're really especially in the dlc you
need one of those two three units uh to
have a chance to go wild i think
which is like i'm i'm kind of doubling
down on badness here but
i accept that i would rather have
i mean just because i like the idea of
an artillery build let's do this
if if we go up against like three ants
and we snipe all three ants that would
be the dream scenario
that's not what's happening here that's
good look at nice trade at the start
we actually win this
we actually win this i i'm stunned level
100 pet boss great name
we i think we got a little lucky slash a
lot lucky
but that's okay let me let's do the
combination mosquito
well you know there is something to be
said
sorry i ate just to be full disclosure i
used some very spicy peanuts just before
this my nose is starting to run i've
been i lean away from them from the mic
and the camera to to wipe my nose
i don't want to sound like i need some
flonase right now
friend eats shop food give plus one
health friend eats shop food he's gonna
eat the garlic armor gun and get the
plus one out there
you guys know
the stroke i think is the name of the
song
i think i think we take you straight up
man i think we take you
i love the sound there
um
and then i think
we'll
roll
i think we will purchase
i think we will purchase a food
which allows us to get some good stuff
going on there i think we will purchase
a swan
and then we'll freeze you
and honestly you're not going to hear
this
out of me too much i think we're going
to freeze this apple i'm not impressed
with our stats but i feel like while we
have a rabbit
lucky us by the way while we have a
rabbit it's not the worst idea to invest
in said rabbit
man we're like actually kind of insanely
lucky
this rabbit will not be here long term
so my my present opinion is like we
might as well get in while the getting's
good
you're not going to be eating we'd roll
regular cat but i don't even know if
regular cat works like this anymore
anyway one of these one of these
one of these
beautiful beautiful uh
beautiful but freeze me we could buy you
but not yet
roll me
this is totally fine
i think you freeze another apple man
like i i'm this build is gonna fall
apart
at some point soon um but for now it's
it's it's going okay this is just a
nasty squad like this is
uh this is a bit of a nightmare
you gotta
accept that that was some cupcake action
i'm pretty sure we got hit by like some
cupcakes there
so i think you um
there's a lot to like we're on round
five sell me this level two mosquito
because we got some plays
start me here
i have to think about this okay because
we're also going to do this
a llama
the llama the unfortunate thing about it
is that it only scales itself
i think
for now
we can totally roll
look okay i think our our best chance is
you sell the cricket
you buy the caterpillar it's really
early it's and we have a bunny that can
help scale up one of these two units
then you put a deer up at the front just
because it happens to be like a strong
unit um we're gonna need a bat
which means next turn we're probably
selling our bunny i don't know you we
could keep a swan going man but level
two
seems okay to me puppy
there's a lot of choices here we're
rolling a bit of a strange build this
would be a good round to not lose
uh
a 1311 ladybug huh okay so we're in a a
very dangerous spot here this this is
bad quite frankly um
i think you definitely like
you know keeping the bunny roll in here
you know what well while we're here
i really feel like believe it or not
the best thing you can do
if you're in a horrible situation you
might you might disagree with this
immensely by the way um
but i feel like if you're in a horrible
situation
the best thing you can do is
try to get your units one level higher
look i really want to win
am i really sticking with you know what
maybe it's time for the bunny to go
sell the bunny
give me a plus five plus five on you
roll me freeze me i almost sold this
swan i don't think i i don't know maybe
i would have regretted it maybe i
wouldn't have regretted it
an 11 15 beetle with garlic come on it's
gotta make it thank you for not getting
debuffed here i respect it i appreciate
it holy crap
did we get through a 7-8 swan just bare
just barely
this is this is nasty man
holy crap
well um that's a buy sell build waiting
to happen there
um
i am
pessimistic
that's a big hold there
pessimistic i think is a fair way to
describe our our current situation
round seven two wins three losses look
all i'm gonna say right now in in my own
defense is that uh
i am a little out of practice on the the
free to play build yeah this is a
disaster man or on the on the pay to win
i've been playing a lot of free to play
this this weekend
dude now we're talking hold on
i'm gonna freeze you because you're half
decent
not as half decent as that though
freeze me
and let me be the uh oh there's a lot of
good ones it'll be the stormy submarines
in honor of the bomb cyclone plus
atmospheric river that's supposed to hit
metro vancouver in the next 24 hours
um
i can't see how this would be a loss
considering we have more stats than you
so we'll take that
you just got a dream shop like i don't
know what can you say right
if we're going to feed
let's feed a bee to our back line which
then allows us to get a 2 4 instead of a
2 3.
i'll roll a mosquito i don't care i'll
put a mosquito out here
so we know we have a guaranteed level up
it's going to be a pretty good standard
unit too that's a nasty unit at the back
there a little lucky on our mosquito
snipe this is where your 2-4 comes in
we
we win these we win these okay this is a
great start this is what you want to see
now maybe an early puppy
that's a dog not to be mistaken okay
early puppy
hatching chick is also really good
i think for now because of the way we're
going to play this you roll dog
buy a fish
combine your fish
freeze me roll me
freeze me
roll me this is this is mighty nice 3-3
dog not that impressive
prepare to be ashamed of your words and
your deeds
9 10 beetle we want garlic instead of b
but it is what it is mosquito shot
probably not for the best this eight six
fish at the back is going to ruin my
life
it's
that's not great but wait a minute hold
on no we lose but no we draw we draw
let's go that's huge
i will always be a believer in the
efficacy of drawing on a pivot like that
just feels nice right so i look there's
two ways to play this order you buy this
it gives your dog one more stat or you
buy bat first and then it gives the bat
an extra stat which i think is is much
more advisable
a tropical fish
i think it's i think i've overrated the
crap out of this item honestly
or this this animal i should say
um
freeze me a cupcake just for a second
here
this is horrible
i
am a believer in investing in our chance
for victory these units i don't want
them to stick around
so i really still want to see a puppy i
would like to see it like on this next
shop if possible otherwise
things get a little dangerous man if we
could just live long enough to hit that
ladybug
that's beautiful that's a very beautiful
thing right there
so our fish can now go the fish is the
flex position you always need a space to
sell something
um but we don't really to be honest with
you like what we see here so i think
this is a roll
you you can make something happen here
you're gonna have to get ready to dump
the hatching chick which is pretty bad
but i think you would do like a sell the
fish
for thr for four gold we get a a stat
and then two
plus one plus ones and i think on u is
is acceptable
we'll probably freeze a caterpillar
by pigs sell pig like it's it's one gold
for one stat on our dog
but
i mean that beats an apple at least
maybe we shouldn't be gauging
our
success
or our perceived success on whether it
beats the worst piece of equipment in
the game but
frees me one of those
you need to get the caterpillar out
early if you're gonna roll it at all um
and you can roll the dog actually like
at the front now
yeah
yeah yeah okay this squad i'm kind of
surprised we're at zero losses so far um
llama squad very interesting
wow
we we made it again every round that we
make it is around closer to our
caterpillar popping and becoming like
extremely useful next thing to sell is
going to be this beetle
it's good right now but it doesn't scale
well
long term you freeze a caterpillar i
don't think we pop it here because we'll
we'll get a guaranteed level up next
turn anyway so i'm i'm a big fan of that
i think as spicy as this looks this is a
sell me
play me
combine me
freeze me
i'm just going to be honest
it's a bad roll but
i think this is a by me
and 5'3 is okay stats will sell you next
time plus two plus two on somebody's
good this is the kind of round you
almost hope you lose in order to get
like this incredible snail play we've
been doing very inefficiently with our
shops but hey you know what there's
nothing inefficient about uh being
lossless so far like ogg vorbis would
you look at this
look at this
there's another win
we're at five already
not that convinced in an early rhino
quite frankly
beautiful beautiful so our snail
unfortunately has no reason to exist
but
we like this
we like this
hmm our caterpillar is very close to
popping um
and the hatching chick is doing good
work there i think we can invest here
puppy is just too late
i wish it weren't the case
freeze me roll me
the next thing we're going to want to
see is uh well you know what a bison
will actually scale pretty nicely for us
there's no reason really to get it out
right now
like i think we play
i think we play ant first
next turn
kill or sell the ant
buy the caterpillar combine the
caterpillar level three new unit plus
bison that'll start scaling it would be
amazing to see uh a can
in our next shop and then we could
we could start to think about like what
our late game squad might look like if
we're if we're lucky enough to get there
it's looking good so far don't get me
wrong
this looks bad like those those sheep
are gonna do a number on us
yeah just barely like we didn't lose by
too much there
um
but still okay so you're gonna die
you're gonna buy
you're gonna combine even though it's
it's turn eight i accept this
eagle's pretty good man but
the fact that i see it so rarely makes
me think that it's not so good
um
so let's let's get that going i think we
could sell a hatching chick now for
something with a more permanent chance
of scaling
dude like the bad is not getting us
there but late game it overriding
equipment is so freaking good i'm gonna
we're swinging for the fences here okay
like what this is something
i wouldn't expect you to understand okay
what we're doing here is
something the likes of which have never
existed prior to this point
we may
regret this immediately
1616 puppy at the back that's why you
like weakness
although they've also got their own
weakness
that's it bat difference bad difference
takes us to six wins
this is i mean there's a lot to like i
think at some point we gotta
you know here's the thing with the bat
okay we can sell a bat
and then buy back a level one bat as
soon as possible
this is gonna be a can
cow
malk
malk
selmy
bison me
combine me
than anything really like you're just
because we can't roll here
um you'd probably just throw like a
quick rooster out at the front
microbe overriding our own garlic armor
i'm not ah you know microbe would make
us all equal like if they had if they
had an equipment difference which it
actually seems like they do then then we
might prefer this but
um yeah that beetle's gonna it's gonna
be kind of nasty
wow
wow the hatching chick at the back got
us that hurts two hp left we leveled up
um we know this is going to be a cell
even though rooster is great it's not
the way we we're we're playing the game
right here we're very much
caterpillar is nice to see
and you know you're going hard here we
would like to see some melon armor for
sure but
i think this will be a bi combine
roll me
i
mean hold up freeze me
um
very interesting
very interesting indeed
dude i'm gonna get crazy start just do
this okay
freeze me i i would love to live here
if we don't
that's life baby it happens
you know where uh that bison is gonna be
a kick in the teeth
or is it well lucky lucky
lucky
lucky we draw that's the hugest draw
you're ever gonna see in your life the
math just worked out
okay holy bursh this is
round 11 too this is a big combined me
didn't even get a new shop
it's fine hit me
hit me
we can roll a hatching chick for the
time being we really need to replace
your garlic the time has come
you know there's i i actually believe
that the way forward for us on this run
is a frozen dragon you're going to sell
the bison you're going to use two flex
positions to buff this dog that way you
can get 350 50s so for now i'm a big fan
of what we got
and this bison is not along for this
world but
i'm still
very very pleased with what's going on
here
um so we're gonna have three 35 33s one
with mel and armor
that's not
lights out guaranteed the weakness
couldn't have been better for us
honestly um
it's this is this is quite good it's a
redemption for our for our two uh
our two win game
you could just roll a t-rex as well
um the scaling might be a little slower
though you gotta you gotta think on this
one
it's a cell
by
like this is a big buff because it's
basically three
it's basically getting six tutus
now
if you don't have level ones
you can roll your t-rex
we don't have level ones
do you want to see something cool you
could do a buy
well we don't really need to get three
50 50s via a dragon if we can just do it
like via cow
and our bison is getting something out
of it
hey tomorrow you're doing okay back
there
now we have exactly enough gold to
guarantee that we get the plus two plus
two which really only applies to the dog
and the bison for now but it's still
pretty great obviously i see a level two
turtle that's scary melon armor is our
is our
biggest enemy right now for sure
but if they have low hp we're still
chunking them down
this is really good
this squad got us there man
that's eight wins
i still i if i don't see level ones i'm
like we we keep the dragon for now but
you're gonna roll me we don't need a
level two dragon really what we want to
see is a turtle i would sell a t-rex or
a bison to get a turtle out here
and now i'm like is this the time where
we cause we really only need you to get
a little extra juice
you know what in that case we want you
to scale faster that's the most
important thing for us in which case we
should invest in rolling here freeze a
turtle
freeze some chocolate unfreeze your
dragon
if we can sell once we get to 50 50 if
we can sell a t-rex get a level two
turtle here two melon armors on our
caterpillars i don't see how we lose um
i don't like right now the squad's
already pretty sick
but i'm i'm
very much trying to build towards a uh
a 10-win run and i think that it this
has the potential i hate seeing the the
stats on that puppy man that's that's
nasty
you piece squeeze juice spelled wrong
don't care didn't ask plus you you
spelled it wrong
realistically the last eight four is not
that valuable okay like it's something
but the the turtle is
the most important thing even just one
melon armor is pretty good
but we are we're rolling deep
i can't look i can't look
this is you know you ever hear oh my
melon armor no my turtle cancels their
microbe but their turtle cancels their
microbe too what's happening
get weak and fool
get
weakened big whoop
this is like when was it louis pasteur
in injected like the penicillin he made
into himself to prove that it worked
that's what we just did right there
we don't really need a level three
turtle
this is going to be our last round
probably no matter what you know we a
scorpion
if we have no other option is totally
fine
the level makes no difference
technically we could get some more stats
we could put some garlic on your turtle
i don't think that makes any sense at
all um none of this makes sense to me
none of this makes sense to me
now this makes sense to me
go ahead melon armor on the turtle how
ironic
when you you lose to a four squad at the
end of the game you just gotta laugh man
now i love this
scorpion does a beautiful trade
we're trading
whatever your steak's gone
dead
dead
let's go
[Laughter]
many people out there many people out
there
they doubted the theory
they doubted the double caterpillar dog
build
they doubted the nine win four squad and
then look at that that feels great man
i'm i'm feeling like i'm on a bit of a
roll yeah we had a two-four
we also we've had two
tens in our last four runs
were like 10 10 5 2. that's not too bad
man
that's not too bad anyway thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed if you did
click the like button helps out a great
deal of course subscribe you want to see
more in the future thanks for watching
i'll see you next time see ya



will now get six wins or more we'll
start the prediction we'll start the
game we're gonna start up in the
free-to-play version
i'm gonna change my stream title to
super auto pets
and then we will change our game name to
our stream title to 10 wins is just like
a normal game is just like average
to me
okay
i gotta tell you
i've been racking up
ten ten nine nine ten nine ten nine him
him me him me
i'm just throwing that out there early
shop my review of this early shop
six out of ten we have a pair of decent
animals no horse re-roll me
we freeze two hor hold on
buy a fish freeze two horses
for the future
prospects early
as we play as the naughty mushrooms or
the sticky mushrooms
i would say this is
50 draw 30 win 20 percent loss
it all depends on the squad
this is a loss fair enough it happens
the horses are not bait horses are you
get a horse early horses are are top
tier
i wouldn't expect you to understand
believe it or not this is a sell a fish
freeze me
roll me two times to improve your shop
quality shop quality sucks run an ant up
at the front
this is this is your dream shop right
here
or your dream build
losing a two-three little spicy oh you
peace one in five chance
totally freaking screwed me this is a
loss again i'm telling you somebody play
this forward if we don't get our
mosquitos sniped
or if we don't get our ant sniped we win
those
okay now you gotta use your thinking
man's game okay
the thinking man's game
i wouldn't mind having a dodo out here
we getting bets tonight boys we lit we
started the bets
about 90 seconds ago you probably missed
them you're showing up at you're showing
up at the first quarter
of the bulls against the sacramento
kings and you're going what the heck the
bets are closed
the casino's closed you missed them
be here on time next time
you got no talent okay you got to play
this i mean this you got to
we're not in a position we can afford to
make any enemies we have to play best
play available
we're going to be rolling a
a squad that's not fully
juiced
unfortunately i accept this as part of
the cost of doing business
no you sell a well that's not smart um
yeah this is the play for squad marty
that kangaroo kangaroo's going to do
numbers
get ready
this is the play man
look at we got we're going up against
the four squad i got to be honest with
you it's kind of a little bit of a nasty
team a little nasty team here
but we make it
we make it
we lose we we lose for sure okay
now this is where we gotta we gotta go
pretty hard
i would start with a roll
that changes things okay i would
probably in this case play a spider and
not pill it
and uh winning is very nice
unfreeze me
freeze me
roll me
you piece roll me you piece roll me
you piece
cupcake me
this is looking pretty bad
yeah dude i i pill spider is one of
those plays that like it looks like so
much fun uh and then you peel the spider
and get a snail and you become the joker
it's happened to me if it's happened
once it's happened a dozen times
look this is not winless yet
for example get owns get owns
get owned get home easy win
now
i think the androids version easier
android version is easier um no it's
like um
when i play the game there's a meta
distorting bubble effect where all the
uh
continental european gamers who are
taking breaks from the counter-strike
lobbies log on and uh you know keep
rerolling the game until they get five
fish in a level three ant
so sometimes you gotta just
you gotta
burn out a little bit of that aggression
let them go on to their ten piece
we get down here in mediocrity and fight
it out in the rancor pit like luke
skywalker in return of the jedi
we roll level two spider kind of stinky
okay now this is this is the way i play
all right
we roll an ox here
we slightly improve our dodo we freeze
some garlic
it's a good squad
with bad stats that's where we're at
right now this is a good squad with
terrible stats
our best chance for the future in my
personal opinion is garlic on your 2-3
kangaroo buff it next turn
and then pray for a good spider
like we want to see a turtle or a sheep
it's two snails in a row can we get the
snail tracker please snail tracker
you're so freaking lucky i don't even
know if you know how lucky you are
we lose this
we lose this
okay pay out the doubters
honestly
should have been better at the start but
a two for two snail on the spider i i'm
very close to putting the spider in my
do not buy territory
you can definitely buy it and pill it in
front of an ant or in front of an ox i
should say
but
the number of snails is getting
ridiculous now this okay we're starting
early we're starting our prediction back
cricket fish is fine we would like to
see a fish
or a mosquito another cricket
ooh
an acceptable start
um
maybe the gushing bushes
two one two one two three it's a nasty
squad man
it's this is uh
this is a loss just due to the power of
the ant it happens golden poop is just
like i get it you know
like
i don't feel bad about losing the golden
poop because i guarantee they give me
five dollars a month so that's not even
like who do you tell me who's really
winning in this situation romy
imo this is a
this is a bee on a fish situation
knowing at some point we might sell the
fish but we
the cricket and ant are not long for
this world one way or another
ooh baby i love your way
thank you so much
we draw these
i'll take it
you can roll an early dog
looks something like combine me
doggone turn three is like very good
dogness
you you're gonna combine me
yes you've already been summoned combine
me beautiful do the turds pretty sick
too you can buy an ants get the buff
combine me
all eyes on me uh spider gives more
triggers to the dog but turtle is just a
much stronger unit overall
um
so let's get something like this going
then roll me
dogs looking kind of sick frees me a
flamingo for the future
i like this squad
one damage no sweat
badger at the back times new broman it's
a great name
many people are saying this
one of the greatest names i think we win
nice you did some damage to me look at
that my b wins me the game
this is good eats man
kill me hit my dog
wake up wake up guerra it's the first of
the month
you get the buff on your dog
and then we're gonna get one of these
it's round four i'm still i'm combining
now
yeah yeah yeah yeah
look i'm a simple kind of man okay
i think we do it like that i think i
think that's our compromise
and then freeze me
no sweat
this is not that scary of a build it all
depends on what their spider spits out
please no turtle and no rams no sheep no
sheep
rabbit i didn't even know you like
existed or whatever
this looks okay man
get body
okay so far so good
another dog
a handbag
okay well i mean you gotta the cricket's
gotta go you need space the only
question is are we buying an otter i
would say the answer to that question is
no are we buying a turtle
you bet your sweet ass for buying a
turtle
to be fair technically
there's a couple lines here you could
buy an odd or sell it buy a giraffe
or
you could roll five is enough to buy two
you know what with the plus one plus one
knowing that the giraffe also gives us
um a buff i'm willing to do this it's
it's a little strange but i'm willing to
take my peak utility right now for the
future
bit of a nasty team
be a great time to have some garlic but
we don't it happens
i don't know we got a lot of hp though
man like we got a lot of hp on that dog
like that looks good that looks good
that looks good that looks good get
owned okay up to three wins already
i can win with these cats you're
absolutely right next level
we will be uh are we gonna run a dodo i
think it's a little late i am omo so
we're gonna hit you with one of these
him me him him me
giraffe is probably not long for this
world
beaver is two gold for plus two health
and plus two attack
i'm willing to do it
the dog needs stats man
oh get your freaking hands up you can
roll a whale behind a turtle
with the dog behind getting ready
knowing we're going to sell our giraffe
in the future
you're fricked man you're freaked so
garlic is huge
the fish is not going to be bought the
the
okay
we're going to be rolling a dog out
there there's no doubt about it kangaroo
must fit behind
can i can i be honest with you can i can
i be honest with you freeze me i'm
rolling a four squad
sell me
sell me
kangaroo
garlic the dog does not eat garlic
because it's getting the melon from the
turtle i almost blew it i almost blew it
that being said we're still
uh
getting garlic let's just say on our
kangaroo for the time being that'll
that's i want them to have equipment if
we're going to be rolling a small squad
our dog should give our kangaroo at
least a few triggers like
that hurts that hurts
love me some melon though um that's a
scary team man
turtle gets you though turtle gets you
you can't harm me oh well it's you know
what
[Laughter]
not bad
that would put us on four wins zero
losses one loss i mean feeling mighty
good feeling mighty good monkey's always
an interesting play
monkey does not work well with whale
build but works like very well
by reputation
um
killing a 4-6 so a whale can have melon
armors kind of trash go ahead you know
meet me meet me on turn seven
that's all i ask
you know words i i get it when you live
your life in the theoretical you feel
like you have a lot of power when you
type sentences in such a way that you
see maria died
you meet me on the battlefield we'll see
how it happens
we may sell whale though like you can
sell whale make a strong turtle
maybe that's what you were getting at
yeah okay hold on so we're gonna be at
eight eight is an awkward number here
i like
then
it's an awkward number it's simply an
awkward number
i'm gonna level with you hit me with one
of these
summon me
him me him him me
we're gonna roll a four squad marty
when are you going to be enlightened
three squad marty
never say never never say never is my
opinion
oh no my monkey
i don't know what dude people hate the
four squad
they literally like if i had a one one
that did jack back there they would
be like so true but a squad of like you
know four freaking beefy dudes
they're like including this 3-3 monkey
[Laughter]
they're like no chance man no you got to
put a 2-2 squirrel back there you got to
put a 2-2 squirrel back there man
sometimes the right play is to run four
okay we got lots of lots of lines that
would hit nice for us right here
i'm really not fully sold on the otter
build but here i go
roll me
they really want me to roll a damn dodo
huh
honestly straight up man
should do me a favor take one of those
is my
it's not good okay it's not good
it's something
i didn't i didn't want to run something
weak at the front just in case they got
some like nasty hippo plays you know
what i'm talking about
anyway this dog is going freaking wild
what a name
there's the believer payout already
wasn't even complicated
okay so you sell a dodo
you buy a dog
combine a dog
you know with a flex position you could
start to talk about getting some buffs
going here you could also start i mean
there's a lot man even though it's late
for a dodo a can completely changes the
game
sharks kind of pog cat cat can be kind
of pog man
really i would say the most important
thing right now though is the dog needs
equipment
does cat can work like if you buy a cat
and then you buy a can does it give all
it gives all future shop animals plus
four plus four
that's so stupid oh you're right the dog
gets melon armor what am i thinking what
am i thinking
meow by the way
holy
i would still keep rolling though
you can with dude i'm just being real
with you with a flex position which we
kind of have right now even the monkey
like it's only buffing the turtle really
um
you can roll a scorpion at any given
moment i think the scorpion might be the
best
level one unit
it does super well especially if you
don't run into melon armor but for now
i'm just going to keep it frozen i'm
going to give it a spot in the shop
do it straight up you can
at this point
sell
that tiger is really good too you're not
wrong you could sell
the monkey
roll a worm and just feed the crap out
of it also you can yuka you i've never
roll in
i've never rolled a uh
a worm cat build i've never really run
the cat in general
this is spicy because like uh it's not
that spicy never mind
the spice was overstated the rumors of
my spice are greatly exaggerated
how did the dog get so insane
i'm just gonna be straight up with you
basically we just got it really early
the monkey is fine like i like that it
gives plus two plus two but
the kangaroo would be next on the
chopping block but you gotta think at
least for now this thing is really like
a 20 20 right now it's a 3 4 with garlic
which looks like dog but like it's
a great secondary creature to have back
there for now but we don't need him yet
so you would i would say roll me once we
just want to see if we get a can
you peace
in a good way though um why don't you go
ahead and freeze me a tortle level 2
total i would prefer i would prefer but
first why not sushi me
freeze me
probably we say no to a scorpion right
now but that's fine man that's fine
that's fine
this squad ain't that scary man it ain't
that scary
almost had me
uh never mind it's kind of scary
but i think our our worm will come
through in the clutch for us man
a draw piece
a draw
hold on it's round 11
it's really hard for me to not just do
this especially considering this cat is
uh
12 13.
we don't need garlic
okay um this round might be a little
spicy but we'll see
they got a tiger giraffe going on
oh this this is
it's a level one we trade then which
means i own you
sorry clutch gatorade
i know what you're thinking but it's no
no no
but you could combine for a level two
cat which must mean
well okay hold on
i always say unfreeze
and then buy me
but i think next you're gonna do a roll
me because we're getting quadruple now
when we combine we get triple right
expose that's true what the heck if we
what if
we what if we
chat i'm testing something what if we
you got plus 13 plus 13
for the cost of three gold i mean
admittedly it's only temporary
but still
this is a little spicy melon armor is a
little hot here
you've removed my melon armor oh i
forgot i own you
oh no
you're dead
okay there's nine wins
holy birch
cat talk
and the best part is we could combine
those cats to a level three and then
just buy some buy a damn scorpion or
something this looks hot i'll admit this
this squad might be a little too hot to
handle
nah never mind there's 10 wins
ah
dude the cans did a lot for us there
double double level 2 cat build who
would have thought they never seen
anything like it before
choose outcome yes i'm telling you man
we're we're not just playing the meta
builds right we're not just playing
fly turkey
shark you know we're playing we're
trying to problem solve
unique to each stage of the game that we
find ourselves at
that was that was a very cool build
thank you for the the push on the the
worm and the double cat
that was a lot of fun
we do need a new tier list like
i did i did some animals dirty man
dragon needs to be so much i don't know
where i put dragon they need to be high
i don't know where i put caterpillar
they need to be high
cat i don't know we'll have to think
about it
once there was a shop
that provided me with opportunities to
shift the meta
i think you go
i think the best thing we could do is
make an animal with three hp
so you buy a cricket then you guarantee
that you buff it
then you throw your ant on it
and then our roll is terrible um
maybe the pouting posers hello victor by
the way
just gotta ant throw some ds on it i was
listening to that in the car today
trying to to research for today's stream
you peace
we draw these
the the beat on throw some ds is kind of
sick you gotta admit
for now i mean why why not
freeze me roll me love it
see this the problem with ants is that
they have so little hp that if they buff
each other they still kind of stink
but what's funny is that our opponent
had more ants ergo we win
very interesting
okay so we're gonna be making two spaces
which means we need to buy two units we
could always roll a level one ant along
you mother you peace
you used to be my friend you used to be
the best creature you could ever ask for
in your entire life
now i don't lose the game anymore as a
result this thing's a big waste of time
2-2 with no upside
you can freeze it it's in that temporary
fourth position so we don't lose
anything i never freeze
well debatable
we need a unit that like
define oh it moves into a normal spot
we need a unit that defines the meta
somewhat like we need a theme to build
around this is fine
you can definitely buy a dodo
straight up i'm dumb as dirt like
give me one of those i believe that this
thing's gonna spit out a turtle this
time
if it spits out a snail i will abandon
the arena i promise you i'm i promise
you this
so let's play it slow
you don't have a horse
don't care didn't ask plus you don't
have a horse
okay it's a giraffe literally the exact
same as a snail but it gets me out of my
foolish gambit
we draw these
dude you call me crazy it's round four
you can roll a dog
even though we did it last time it's the
best player available
sell me
everyone just chill for a second okay
this is important
12 gold okay we're gonna leave you for
now you got ball players too
we're going to buy you
things are the temporary regression pill
you very nice very nice
that is not on nice
if it wasn't gonna hit the dog that's a
great get
you can absolutely
play a cricket
you can absolutely combine your cricket
you can
absolutely play a turtle
it's a little goofy i thought we were
going to be doing some scampi build but
a turtle is definitely a top tier
tier 3 unit
you piece
it's a good shot you can't be mad
and yet here i am
malding
anyway we win these okay this is looking
pretty good
it's looking pretty good dude you can
roll a rabbit um
i'm gonna be straight up with you for
one
for one
you kill your spider
it spits out a camel gives you a little
buff the camel is like
it's functional although it's a two two
two
you need to be a two five or get get out
of my face
rabbit is an interesting one that that
all agree but you know what you can do
is a little spicy but hear me out here
sell me
buy me
buy me
garlic me
it's a nice little double buff there um
maybe not amazing but a nice little
double buff i'm gonna be honest there's
two things you could do here one thing
you could do is combine and then buy the
other thing you could do is just roll
sell one and then buy a better unit and
i think that's my play
and there's definitely better units to
be had here
will freeze you
will freeze you
um personally i would probably say that
a flamingo is uh pog
get sold
get bought
no we might as well take advantage of
your garlic right now
garlic is still it might even be better
than melon early so i'll live with this
yeah i'll live with this
interesting
it's pretty pretty high damage that's
pretty high damage oh never mind i miss
the part where i own you okay we make it
again
that'll take us to three
hey impulsive veins
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
you know what's fun is uh
feeding food to the flamingo and then
buffing it after it dies that's always a
fun time
um
thanks again thanks again for the gifted
subscriptions you know what else is fun
level two turtle
you can you can play a kangaroo back
here man
like you you could play
really it would look more like this
you get a nice buff
these are these are big plays
i'll be straight up with you okay for
one for three gold
is inefficient
but i like the scaling i like the
scaling
you see a lot of equipment like this
this is a person that has golden poop
but has not collected it yet this is a
this is a nasty team
they have pilled a turtle to buff their
dog they're so cocky they're rolling a
giraffe
that is a nasty team
you have to respect it you got to
embrace it quite frankly
now here
we like it
i think rhino can run in the early game
we really need our dog to level up and
we need our dodo to level up
an early rhino with a little with a
little melon on it
and a little dodo in front of it you
should have gone kangaroo first because
of the way we're gonna run this but
it is what it is
sorry dog
thank you we'll take this for a second
okay
look at my turtle man i'm going to jail
dude i know rhino is doubter tech okay
i agree
it does help oh no oh you know hold on
it does help us trade with the fish
which is a big help
you you peace
you peace
okay
times are tough
that was just a nasty squad yet again
i'm not sweating it quite yet
we have no reason to play a can yet
okay
straight up you're a piece
do i gotta be honest hippo is basically
you but stronger
take an early pivot on that
then roll something like this instead
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah forget the rooster for now don't
worry about the rooster for now
oh we need to put the front because of
the monkey but okay whatever
don't care didn't ask
do we kill you we kill you that's great
news
doesn't help us too much but hey we get
through you we get through you don't
really do much there get through you we
win we win these we win these
this dog is in a rough spot
we
don't really want to scale
this is so weird
we don't really want to sell anything to
scale the thing we want to sell is the
dog
so is it the only i'm holding on to him
right now
in order to get us the maximum believer
potential early but it's i think it's
too late i think we got to start scaling
this son of a gun i just wish i could
repurpose
his uh
his garlic armor because it would be
helpful right now
there's got to be a play here
i think you you have to go a speculative
can and then please
this is a tough one
turkey's great long term deer is great
you know
you know can i can i tell you something
i'm going to run something you ain't
never seen before in your whole goddamn
life
[Laughter]
a one option deer in position four
that's the play we need the hippo at the
front we need the hippo to get the dodo
buff
that ergo these fall into place
we need the turtle to have two things
behind it i've done the matrix
multiplication it's the only way it's
the only way to do it
four squad
holy birch
it's okay we get a nice two-tap
we got our own melon armor
this looks bad that dodo is really
strong
we we were one away like one if we had
two melon armors you would have made it
it's not really how it works okay
there's some obvious plays we don't
really care for a level two deer
we need to get the chocolate going first
i don't see how we do anything but roll
a gorilla
um
but i have to be
a little afraid
because i also want like a cow that
because but if i bought a cow
it would have overridden the gorilla
position with the milk
i i looked at that and i actually
believe it
i think it would have overridden this
shot position with the milk and we would
have lost the gorilla
we could have rolled once maybe then we
i don't know if we would have had enough
gold but
i think it i think it would have
overridden it man i'm just being
straight up with you
i guess we're buffing our turtle
no shot no shot
i'm gonna be honest like
we really want this monkey
you know what would hit a little harder
than a monkey plus two plus two
i think is a a cell
by plus two plus two
cow
plus two plus two plus two plus two i
think it's the only way man
but now hold on now we can roll
this damn squad right here and i'm
feeling like a damn dream
a snake the snake's a little spooky okay
oh no my cow
you peace
you peace we were scaling you peace
coconut armor please thank you my
coconut gun shoots in spurts we lose
these
honestly
4-4 pay out the doubters
we
strong early game
ran into some nasty squads in the mid
game while simultaneously just
like cycling didn't go deep when a
little too wide part of it is the shops
you get part of it is you know a lack of
commitment it happens i'm honestly happy
to to give four wins out of that one
we'll take a mosquito
i mean we'll take a a horse and a fish
and then freeze our other horse
interesting squad to start with
maybe the leaking legs
the squad's not too nasty you gotta
shoot the ant that's the ticket baby we
draw that's still drawing against anthon
fish is good man is good stuff
now
you go horse
we definitely go crooked might as well
there you go now we got a nice 3-2
cricket out there which is going to spit
out a 3-1
beautiful
pray
you don't go up against mosquito bills
okay we want to see no mosquito bills
ants
not that bad
i think
we win these
we draw these okay whatever i'll take it
we draw these
okay okay
sell me
buy me
did i do that
you want us you want to see something
that'll ruin your life
i don't know what's gonna happen here
okay
but in my heart of hearts
i think we can get a temporarily
freaking sick
horse but we're probably gonna end up
rolling a three squat okay
it'll look something like this
six four
four one
five two
six three yeah maybe if she's five foot
one um and then
everyone shut up okay you don't
understand
come help me
five five camel up at the front sell me
meet me
three squad who asked for the three
squad
oh son of a
all right this is a loss
we thought
[Laughter]
oh you thought all right this one it's
still got some long-term prospects quite
frankly still it's still good um
probably be looking at something like a
little peacock short and stout three
five
what do we have one loss big whoop zero
wins that's not great
you know what toss me one of these
that is a huge hit me this is one of the
hugest hmms you're ever gonna see
the whale has no purpose
but i freeze it anyway because i respect
it
i hate seeing the golden poop man
thank you for being a bunny that that is
a game changer
also thank you for being a friend down
the road and back again
your heart is true you're a friend and a
confidant
we draw these
that's infuriating
still one extra gold
okay we need to get ahead man this is
not getting us ahead here
a strong elephant can play it forward
but really all we're doing with the
elephant is weakening a camel to make
our peacock really strong
if our peacock is bodied like we're kind
of eating it but
look it's better than a horse that does
nothing i suppose
unfreeze me
dude i don't know if we're going like
full commitment build
might as well buff the peacock even
further
i'll statue it matters
it matters
now i'm like okay now you get a kangaroo
you sell the fish
you roll a kangaroo here instead as this
gets stronger the kangaroo is stronger
him him me him me okay
now this is we may lose immediately but
we have chances for our future
we need a lot of equipment we just hard
pivoted our whole squad
how'd you get a level two fish in there
what's your whale doing man what's your
whale what's his story
we lived
what are you spitting out what are you
spitting out
you peace
we were in there too
okay
sorry we had two lives to play with the
scaling is happening
it's actually okay
i know it looks bad because it hits the
peacock but the peacock is also going to
get plus two health from every hit from
the elephant
that the elephant hits the camel yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
bro it's kind of this is a scary time
it's not a worm man a one one worm nah
man nah nah nah nah nah
for now this is not this is just to get
one more trigger on our kangaroo but
like
we'd like to replace it with garlic
yesterday if possible yesterday if
possible that's nasty
that's nasty
you got a nasty little squad here
whatever you're popping
you're popping
you're a straight up piece there you go
okay
owns
we draw these we win these we win these
keep me going we got we got space now
okay i just want you to have the extra
hp that matters a lot we want some
survivability on you that guy's build is
a zachtronics game
[Laughter]
honestly giraffe get out of my face you
stink nobody likes you okay elephant me
you're a piece whatever still kind of
sick
we don't respect you we respect you
we don't respect you this is we're going
wide we are going wide we need some
garlic we need some melons maybe it's a
little early for those melons but we
need them what's up with this hippo man
what are you doing with this hippo you
got a four seven default hippo just
chilling up at the front
have you lost your damn mind it's a
scary squad though the roll me squeeze
me team on as the uh
for the enemies yeah this looks terrible
this looks really bad
this isn't our last life right we got we
got one more
yeah yeah i'm not sweating it then okay
big plays obviously
i mean straight up
longer you live the happier i am
please give me a camel or a kangaroo
thanks for the one hp
this is this is a damn nightmare
what uh okay you hit my bunny who cares
i i don't like seeing those sheeps up
there
that ox is going to be a real pain in
the butt the peacock's got to do some
work
peacock please are you living long
enough you're not come on don't be
ridiculous is the kangaroo gonna be able
to do something here hold on a 10 13.
we lose these we lose these all right
pay out the doubters again that's a one
win game
that one hurts
i'm telling you we need an early game
that gives us some definition
this is not it
cheesy fishes sounds good sounds good
the shops have been a little funky today
what is this
what like what are you doing
oh i know what you're doing you golden
poop piece of
uh i rerolled trying to get the dream
shot i rerolled i have to roll the two
squad i'll try it and see if it works oh
i lost okay abandoning game
you peace
i see you
this is an easy sell me
by me
thanks for the buff me this is an easy
freeze me
roll me
buy me
buy me
roll me
i want nothing to do with the rest of
this
don't combine me
four two and oh dies like the rest of
them
okay
we get you we don't get you that's
unfortunate we get you we get you easy
easy mode two wins
you gotta level up it must be done
it's an amazing
it's a gift
you can definitely roll it in front if
an answer strongest unit you roll in
front of an ant is that simple man
um
straight up this is a sell me
i love it
this is a buy me
three five elephant at the back
you can start to think about a dodo if
you get your fish leveled up you get an
easy plus one plus one on it
we don't want to level you up that's
fine
this might be a pill turtle situation
we'll see
so as long as our ant kills you i'm i'm
a very happy individual
what is this squad the nefarious
buttocks if you're if you're gonna roll
dog horse you gotta bring your a-game
there's place
what can you say here there's place
you gotta go man i'm sorry you gotta go
holy birch
i mean i'm
sometimes the stars just a line
you find yourself looking at a scampi
build
look this could be spooky in like some
other parts of the world this is a
little actually this squad is insanely
cracked congratulations you're very good
at the game
so one of the strongest teams you could
ever expect to run into here holy crap
it's a very good team
okay
well i mean
you know you're starting me with a selmy
that's a given thanks for the scampi
build
um
i would love a level 2 turtle even
though i froze this it was mostly as a
joke
level 2 dodo
bro straight up
i'm like chili's she's like
straight up freeze me
roll me
nah man it's too late it's too late for
you
we're almost going for like a pure
scaling squad here
it's we got to get there early you're a
piece man
pieces me off so much
this this squad's going down
that's just again we ran into honestly
like a pretty pretty nasty team that was
the same guy that's a heavy you piece
moment
um
look i would love to get a fish
popping and not have to sell the shrimp
so let's let's give it a try snail's big
here
turtle comes out now turtle's getting
buffed we can roll our own dolphin
it can be done
garlic doesn't really apply to i guess
you could put garlic on the turtle
i'm rolling kind of deep though i'm not
sure if you noticed that
don't freeze me
this fish we just need one of them one
of them buy them selling
please oh my god every time
if i see another damn sheep i'm going to
lose my mic yeah you're a nice snail you
peace
that's what i'm talking about man that's
what i'm freaking talking about
i'm you but stronger
four wins
you gotta get the dodo you probably can
up
knowing that you're gonna sell this
dolphin at some point fish me
that's how you shop like a mother i'm
gonna be straight up with you man
you could buy an apple you could buy a
bee imo you just roll i think you roll
you look for greener pastures
i would say without a doubt the roll was
well worth it
even if we lose this round we set
ourselves up better for the future
we got way more than one one worth of
value there double badger into a into a
hedgehog build huh well
pretty stoked that i kept my dolphin
around
[Laughter]
have to imagine that they needed those
to pop in exactly the right order
lucky me
well you get out of here i
i mean our fishes got to go at some
point it's gotta go
can makes it easier to get rid of your
fish
you know we're gonna get one off the
roll in a second anyway you just
you just say thank you
really um
for now you need to uh have something
out there so we'll send out a little
rooster that's gonna get a nice buff on
it we'll freeze you
might as well freeze you man we're
probably gonna sell a dolphin to fit you
in at some point that's gonna be a level
three dodo mighty interesting a level
three dodo
peace
great time to have dub melon
i see i see what you got going on here
you know what though i'm not sweating it
you see why i'm not sweating okay maybe
we're never getting rid of our uh
rooster
um
unfreeze me
by me
so you fit
but where
gorilla brilla bobrilla
where do you go you ever play that game
i'm just like
this is a good time to think about it
okay because like
when you
play the gorilla
you want the gorilla
no you absolutely want the gorilla to
get melon armor
because then it'll trigger a second
better melon armor
yes
roll me
freeze me
no buy me you stay frozen you don't give
us a buff yet
well tough tough luck on your rhino you
peace
oops
oops
nice melon armor uh you peace
okay i gotta admit your deer stacks up
pretty nice here
oh too bad i got a coconut shield you
piece get killed
oh no a badger
ah anyway uh
seven wins
holy second dodo has anybody ever done
this before straight up man you roll you
roll a rooster at level two before you
roll penguin level two so you hit this
snake's always an interesting idea but i
i love the idea of the penguin scaling
here
um
and for three let me tell you man for
three for three
there's always you think about maybe a
turkey coming through here but i don't i
don't i don't believe in the power of it
i simply don't i think you buff your
dodo distribute it out a little bit here
golden poop four squad
has been nice knowing us
never mind we win these
easily crushed the golden poop where's
the hippo mouth you you give me one i
would i don't know if i would roll it
here but in general i would i would
describe myself as a pro hippo gamer
there's a lot of stuff to like here we i
can't believe we don't have any built-in
melon man
honestly let's not look at gift horse in
the mouth okay
we got a little hp to play with here
i'm not too worried about a scorpion
going 1v1 with my turtle
this uh dude i gotta be honest with you
though is a pretty nasty squad
[Laughter]
the splash damage rooster holy crap
we weren't that far off
that's okay
this is too complicated for it's got too
many pages for any sane man to
understand like in theory you could roll
tiger on dodo you've got
three unbelievably strong units that
seems very good you could also
completely rework your squad sell tiger
run tiger rooster at the back and then a
slightly inefficient dodo at the front
but then you would get four
12 one roosters on death i gotta say
that i think no matter what you're not
long for this world
and you are going to exist and then to
be quite honest with you you need a
one-up just in case you get sniped
i really forget garlic man our turtle
needs melon armor or a buff
the buff will go
probably still to the dodo
you we could get a little extra juice
out of you
you know what
keep this frozen put a stake on that
turtle
it actually uh now that i think about it
it's getting 47 attack
probably did not need it
oops i won
suspense pants
win number nine tiger ability stays oh
you're absolutely right
the tiger ability stays even if he gets
sniped
well in that case
take one of those
yummy
big big time yum
did you see the r subway post by the way
um
that
there
they got an online order
that said
toasted sandwich
yummy yummy yummy
you didn't see that one
oh oops
we won
another 10 wins
dude we we had some
doubter energy for part of this hour but
to be straight up we also had some
incredible believer energy we had two 10
wins in one hour that's pretty solid
we're gonna throw in a slash marker



be on the pay to win version of the game
keep that in mind before we get started
here we're getting closer to golden poop
when i get i hope by the time we get to
golden poop they put something in the
game that lets you just shred your
points because i would never be caught
dead roll in the golden poop
i might buy it and then switch back to
beret
i gotta i didn't know i don't even see
the berets anymore man
these just look like normal animals to
me that's how twisted i am
freeze me
be the flooded ice cubes
donkey donkey donkey dunk
don't shoot my aunt
we got so lucky i call out the unluck
when i see it we just got like
unbelievably lucky so you got to call it
out man there's a 1-0
we love it
we love it
we should do an sap sound tier list that
would be that would be fun
you know what straight up
i don't do this too much all right
go ahead and i was gonna say break them
off a preview of the remix but let's
just pretend that's uh
that's not by uh one of uh pop music's
greatest monsters and uh that's the
cover by uh by dave grohl dave grohl did
that cover i think
please buff me we're still gonna
we're still gonna draw these we draw
these
we win these we win these get owned okay
easiest combined in my life
yeah a-hole
gotta win we gotta win this round sorry
i i was actually puzzling that out like
a chess move okay
we gotta win this round this this would
be a nice win it would be a big win
not a scary creature got nasty little
freak fish at the back too bad get owned
okay we're on 3-0 that's good but our
squad sucks
needs a little bit of help
that's why we're hoping for pills man
turn four i'll be straight up with you
you can roll a dog
we can start trying to buff this dog
i'm really gonna sell a fish buy a fish
come on man give me a just give me a
combine
followed by one of these
followed by this
followed by roll
that's that's not bad that's not that
bad
you're gonna give me a dirty level up
how do we like this
yeah this is fine we got five okay units
good ant buff who knows
do we have any idea when nl will finish
house of ashes
rip who's gonna tell them
this is not it's not your fault
we did it yesterday though
it's true that's a nasty squad man holy
crap 810 peacock at the back
honestly like why not
that's that's not bad man
holy
i've i never done this before okay
i have never gotten to like nine wins
and run into a llama
i
don't i just don't see it man i just
don't see it happening
it just doesn't make any sense okay
yummy oh we should've got an ant com and
you know what no because we're gonna be
getting rid of our aunt soon
don't care didn't ask plus you're an
aunt
we need
we need to
uh sell a fish i'm a sick
bish i sell a quick fish
i move away from the mic to breathe in
freeze me cat or you need to get a dog
out there for no no this is fine this is
fine it's fine man
i'm uh dumb uh
roll for now freeze me
roll me
this will work man freeze we're going to
rework our whole damn squad we got that
we got the hp to work with this okay
this this round is going to be a damn
mess
i give you no promises for the meantime
i don't know it actually might be
okay
you mother
whatever we win um
but i think long term we got some real
prospects here
that's how you shop like a mother like i
just want to peel you man and pill you
to make this space
i'm very happy keeping the shop frozen i
love these units like a boss
okay guess what gets sold dummy but this
gives us the space to do this
which gives us a space to do that which
gives us the space to do this
which gives us a space to do that which
gives us space to do this
you're a piece honestly you'll start to
scale pretty soon but not soon enough
for my liking
kill me
you're actually like a piece okay you're
gonna freeze me
we're gonna need a garlic for next round
explain pill um wow we got pretty lucky
there honestly um the thing with uh
pilling gives you upside if there's an
upside
to the creature fainting so when you
kill a flamingo we would get a plus two
plus two on two units
we killed an and we get a plus four plus
two on one unit these are pretty useful
gets honestly
and the pill is not uncommon which is
why this is pissing me off
all right well we gotta think about long
term
and long term
uh we'd rather buff a bat than a
hatching chick so
give me this give me this
kill me
beautiful buff on two units we respect
and enjoy
okay it's fine it's fine man we're
living until this caterpillar pops our
whole job is just to get
um
golden poop piece of crap
our whole job is just to get
uh the
dog to the highest possible level of
greatness we are gonna lose this but
uh and then the caterpillar will get you
there he disrespects worm all day long
uh tell me you weren't here when we had
a 10 worn ten win worm marty without
telling me you weren't here when we had
a 10 win worm marty okay guess what
you're sold um you're bought
you're freaking sold
can i be dead ass with you for a second
the turtle on the caterpillar is an is
an all-time strategy
borderline necessarily necessary for
caterpillars to win as a result
um we'll be rolling a hatching chick
temporarily
you're a piece maybe
maybe no you're you're you're not a
piece you're a god
now it would be really nice
to not lose this one i would accept the
draw
golden poop same piece of crap same guy
same guy
it's like we're the same person she'd be
sipping on that black and blue label
we draw these i'll take it
caterpillars pop in next round i mean
these these are easy place hit my dog
you piece
i think we can roll garlic for one more
round
but you know what we should buy the
turtle last buff me because this is
technically a double buff
technically a double buff
okay
yeah i'm i'm a i'm a i was gonna say i'm
a dog funneler i didn't like the way it
seemed to be phrased um i will be trying
to
make my dog very strong
you're a piece look at you see his 32-32
puppy here
okay this fine we're gonna level up here
we're gonna have two great units
that's a strong puppy man you can't be
mad
we need it to be set up like this
so you get the hatching chick buff
honestly
i'm going man
that's just the kind of person i am like
i don't give a man
not greed you're greed
get owns
we win these
that's a scary squad
level one level one you kill my turtle
you peace
get on
get owned i'm still not owned i'm still
not owned i'm still not owned we win
these okay
it's scary but we're doing this is how
we get to 10 wins
it's not about the believers anymore
okay skyler i did it for me i did it for
me
don't want it
buff me
even if only temporarily
pill turtle in your damn dreams
actually the pilling turtle is not well
it's it's okay if you put the melon
armor on the dog imo
but you don't want melon armor on the
caterpillar
because when it transforms into a
beautiful butterfly it loses all that
level three turtle huh okay this that's
very spooky
that's that's a very spooky
we lose these
that's a nasty that's that squad is
honestly like specifically designed to
counter bats so you can't really be mad
they went they went for it and they got
it
but we we had a good enough squad to
make it through there
we'll run the prediction back it was a
fun one
look at my turtle dog i'm going to the
shadow realm
that was greed
second caterpillar oh no
oh the streamer had fun oh no wait a
minute you're not a fish
we need to not die to a single mosquito
shot we need to not die
to
a
a one one cricket
maybe the sniffing streamers it's been
known to happen
we draw these it's okay
i'll take a draw there
don't disrespect bird
it's not very good
how's that for some disrespect
i i don't mind rolling this this is
this is a bit sneaky
but i'm telling you you can do it you
can do this
this is draw potential
i would have preferred to not be on you
know double uh beaver if possible
okay i see what they got going on they
got the ants set up in order to give
them a maximal chance on their green
beetle but i gotta say and and chap put
me on to this
we draw these
uh i don't i don't like the ant at the
back strategy anymore i'm a big believer
i just feel like it's been better since
we've been rolling answer the front
yummy
these are big yummies
soon
you know what
take a chance on me
hold on i was so excited i got on top of
my
my computer cord my headphone cord
that's good
you're a piece
um
would probably say if we want to win a
round
we're going to need something like that
yummy
get ready i'm not i'm not sure if we're
doubters or believers now
if you're not sure
then i'm sure by the way we lose these
like i said if you want to win this
round
when are you adding jeff petrie
bloodshot eyes as a better twitch tv
emote has that emo been made yet
um
this is a horrible situation man
honestly i regret this immediately but
um
you want to see some cool
pill me buff me
sell me
by me
something like that seems okay
please
lovely
lovely bad difference
we need to get to the bat though
that's not gonna happen okay well life
sucks um
please give me some units
that are available to me
honestly man 3-5 fish you got to go i
didn't want to do it okay i didn't want
to do it but it had to be done
um one thing i will be doing by the way
is
one of the strongest plays you'll ever
see in your life then you know what
i'm going hard
in the paint outside of the paint i
don't really care
give me a six nine dog
i mean a six nine dog
freeze me i'm rolling i'm rolling two
rabbits here
i don't care
i'm a rebel
this would be big
ah son of a
hold on one one cricket hold on you get
owned hold on you don't get owned but
you kind of get owned we draw these we
draw these let's go let's go
get me out of here man come on we can do
this we can do this
big yums
thank you
we can do this man we can do this
no let's go huge save owned owned owned
owned you're owned okay
look nobody's perfect okay but this is
this is how it has to be done
food build
yummy yummy build all we need is a
caterpillar i'm going i'm too deep in
the rabbit hole man i'm too deep in the
rabbit hole
okay they got a caterpillar
as long as my dog never gets hit by a
bat we got no problems it's okay you
don't see too many bats in this game so
no big deal there's another easy win for
us food metal
up like
i'm like chili's she's like
thank you
thank you
it's also like the fastest game you're
ever gonna see
no bats no bats no bats no bats
i gotta tell ya i gotta tell you i think
our dogs a little bit better i think our
dogs a little bit better
we literally have like one unit
that's it
i don't even know why i got this
hatching chick i guess i'm deciding at
some point maybe a 5'5 will be that
important
okay now you got to think
honestly i've been loving having two
bats
uh
so
i have to think
okay i think you probably combine the
bats
i think you buy
combine
some in i was gonna sell a beetle but
you know what we're getting something
out of this
we're getting something out of this
just we could we could exist and get a
caterpillar man 25 43 dog is a damn
nightmare until we get weakened even
with weakness i'm just going to be
honest we're kind of popping i really
needed you not to hit me
that being said you're a piece
you win easily
there's four
you peace
whatever you think
i mean come on
you know what you do first though
yummy yummy not no
twins basil
sell me
buy me
i know it doesn't work yet
just chill just chill
him me that level two bad next turn is
also gonna unlock tier six for us holy
birch
they got a t-rex scaling build
big whoop here's what i think about your
t-rex
you peace
all right actually you're gonna win this
one congrats melon armors goated
you gotta go man
you gotta go
now we literally have
one unit
roll buy food
because cupcake kind of stinky
freeze
scale me
no scorpions
let's go
kind of
nine damage please okay maybe we got a
little lucky
you had three gold
lull so true end turn if you have three
or more gold give other friends plus two
plus two oh sorry my mistake yeah you
know what put your star is in a sack you
piece
oh sorry sorry user was banned for this
post i audit the chat logs doesn't talk
in chat for another six months new
account created yesterday hey guys i'm
new here how do you chat here
streamer is so smart
i see it coming you peace
okay we this is the believer win
if possible we need some melons men
how do you do fellow chatters
yeah probably the rabbit can go that
seems sensible i honestly think you like
sell a rabbit
which means you don't need a sauropod
long term you roll a scorpion to canal
to counter their scorpion
him him me
i'll tell you this shit's pissing me off
we need to um
make a
t-rex stronger
probably free well doc doesn't really
need it honestly
it's not a bad idea
i think like you can roll steak scorpion
which allows you to get around
melon armor on a semi-week unit
no no no you're right it counters the
peanut that's my mistake
okay then we roll buy a better food like
a zushi for example
get the refund go back to three gold
freeze you
sell you
we're about to do an inside trader build
the inside trader build has begun
the dogs still gotta freaking live man
it ruined their chili
get owned well your whole your whole
build is coming crashing down man
we draw these we win these there you go
pay out the believers
play me
sell me
buy me
roll me
you
peace
for now
roll me i want this scorpion up at the
front roll me freeze me freeze me
set up for a beauty next turn
you could think you could you
have you ever had a dream that no
because it'll replace the one up
or the the the death touch it'll replace
the death touch
no melons oh tough luck baby
your owns um owns
little ownage your own level one that's
cute
you're owned we draw these
you need some melon armor
stat
stat man anyway you're gone
you're involved
oh you're gone
welcome to the party pal just kidding
you're owned get out of here you suck
sell me and then you guys know what i
like that's what i like that's what i
like
four squad marty
weaken the turtle yes
okay honestly though that dog is cracked
we're gonna lose
but we would have lost
if we had a 3-3 turtle there instead of
melon armor as well that's honestly
that's just what happens when you lose
or draw early and end up going for the
your seventh win on game 21 um
we do pay out the believers though
we can run back one more one more
we take those
this is a play this is a play
guys so play man
these are plays
be the bumbling bagels
yeah the scaling in in pay to win is
crazy
that's why i'm like early puppy man if
you can get a puppy on
turn three
we take those
freeze the bird i'm gonna be straight up
with you i think the bird is dog
i do not think is very good
i'll freeze you for now
why aren't you at the front man why
aren't you at the front
well we got a chance to test that theory
we can put that theory to the test here
theory of a test man
we draw these
tell that to my golden poop all that
means is you're like me and you have no
life
okay this is big you can roll an early
dog okay
but i'd love to see a puppy holy burst
on dog meta which is where we currently
stand
we love a cell combined
you don't always have to combine
honestly
you sold me you sold me you peace
i think you can do it for a bit
i don't know if you can roll it forever
this is a scary squad
four with a sheep
and then an eight six fish at the back
we win these but it's close
it's close
in this house we love a combine
into an ants
into a combine
into a by me
into a cell me
into everyone shut up for a second okay
into a
bad
into a sold rabbit
that's then going to get combined the
beetle green ladybug combines with other
green ladybug
yeah yeah yeah that's the play man
that's the play
it's all in the service of an early
caterpillar
our dog goes freaking wild
it goes crazy on you
we win these
what's better green ladybug red beetle
it's not even close green ladybug
crushes red beetle they're not even in
the same ballpark quite frankly
combine me
you gotta go might as well might as well
do it now while we got units we like
that's fine i'll take a five-five bet
i'm a sick frick i like a quick frick
thanks for the buff
you know that's it just in case freeze
me
you peace
y'all ready for this no wait
i sell my beetle
i sell my beetle to get the caterpillar
out there earlier
if we lose this round big whoop thanks
for the free scaling dumbass
buff my caterpillar for no damn reason
batman good bad talk thank you
big plays ooh tough plays for me i guess
yeah this looks like a heavy loss for
sure we were not by too much though
double snail
sell me
buy me
sell me
buy me
sell me roll me
snail me i was i was eager i was itching
for a damn snail man give me one of
those give me one of these

level too bad wow that's funny i got two
level one bats we're not so different
we're like basically best friends
is this like your team is supposed to be
good did you know that you're supposed
to like um
like build a team that wins games
like the goal of the game is to actually
win
i'm sorry bm sorry sorry
honestly bat you can roll with this man
you can roll you can roll with this
and you can roll with that we we can
roll
it's probably early enough for a bison
but a bison honestly i don't respect it
instead
i'm a big believer in
in buying a beaver
thanks for the free gold
which also allows us to get something
like this going on would you believe it
oh baby
yeah we're rolling temporary goat meta
it's for econ purposes
that's such dude we've gotten so lucky
on our
bad plays i don't even want to mention
it because it makes me feel bad just
kidding
thanks for the win
okay yeah i see you're a sheer point and
substitute my own okay thank you
probably do one of these real quick
probably dump one of these on there
probably do one of these real quick
somebody sell you real quick thanks re
that's that's who needed that yeah
that's a good one um
i'm not a rooster believer
dude honestly a pig is a free buy for us
in this situation that's crazy talk
holy birch
i'm gonna be straight up with you man
i'm gonna be straight up with you
we're just we're just buying you
we're not even putting you on there
we're just buying you
then we're gonna focus on we you know we
need to do we need to get a damn cat out
here buff the crap out of that dog
now we're talking we
your safety is not guaranteed i have
only done this once before
you're a piece you're a piece
okay we lose these
that's a nasty squad honestly
wait we have one life now
two lives oh two two lives no sweat
easy buff
need some cats
honestly this is a sick play
you can't even be mad
the goat is not long for this world
let's sell this son of a gun
and honestly let me be honest with you
momentarily
it's going to roll like a dang
it's going to roll dang sheep out there
for a
minute bat me on the front oh
front bed
this looks okay nice golden poop squeeze
juice by the way
nice golden poop a lot of good did you
okay
next
need a turtle
turtle would really hit the spot or you
know at some point you could also just
in theory give me like a level two dog
no don't be ridiculous
roll me
straight up man i'm like by me
i'm like sell me
then dear me like that's the play
this is the believer victory potentially
right here
potentially la this is very scary squad
by the way
level two turtle into very strong units
i would predict a loss on this one
i don't see how it could be anything but
here we go this is the ultimate believer
play
well there's some there's some good
plays here
this would be a selmy
this would be a by me
a beautiful buff
a selmy a romy
a snail me
a selmy
i'm giving it everything i got to get a
turtle okay
i'll freeze one of you
molybursh

sell me
buy me
come by me

please please
please
very scared of this turtle thankfully
the the turtle is a mere level one
but we are about to get like quintuple
weakness
okay big whoop we win
seven wins
now we got two of these sons of guns
[Laughter]
alrighty i mean we might as well
more than anything else we really just
need like a turtle
if we can get a level two turtle like
we're living the damn dream come on man
like maybe in the future but come on man
come on
come on turtle
turtle me you peace
buff me
level i'm seeing a level two turtle it
scares me hey we did purge one of the
weaknesses though that's quite nice
it's a easy own easy own we live
i think we still kill you
this doesn't matter
we own you okay that look at that nice
golden poop
that's eight wins
straight up i'm like send it man
i don't even want a can roll me we're
looking for greatness today
garlic doesn't do it we're looking for
bat turtle bat turtle fat turtle you're
a piece quite frankly you're a piece i
say
that's all you need to say
no bats please
we really needed to purge the bison's
melon armor but you know what is
turnabout is fair play man
they they got some beautiful odds there
we get some beautiful odds here this is
a loss it is
well done schlongzilla
what a name
schlongzilla
that's good though eight wins pay out
the believers yes we will thank



hey everybody welcome back i gotta tell
ya
i know we've had some good runs lately
we gotta go back to free to play for a
bit
played on my phone last night
ten nine ten nine like we were oh well i
mean there's no wii
i was ripping it up man now it i'm not
saying we're
we're destined i'm not saying we're
guaranteed i kind of like the mosquito
play here honestly now that i i'm
too far will be the unwashed feet to go
back i love an ant and ants win rounds
but an ant hitting for four but only
having one hp is not good i i would
classify this as a it's a guaranteed
loss
but we we are positioned nicely for
future rounds with two horses and an ant
we just need the you know another unit
that gets the the beautiful payoff
uh with two horses and and again i you
might suggest i overrate the horse a
little bit
there's a case to be made i suppose that
that's that's the truth there we go
um but this is now looking really good a
3-2 that's gonna give a plus two plus
one as well when that's over
sorry i just had the wave uh there's a
it's a
somebody very uh
angry outside wants to give me a package
or something like some kind of jerk
something i ordered on amazon maybe
i'm being facetious of course but um
there we go this is a big win
this week we got good optics for the
future okay
you get your next level ant it's the
perfect time you have a camel
functioning as well
um
i mean honestly
you can laugh at me all you want this is
not like a bad squad but it's not a
squad we want to keep rolling forever
i kind of feel i mean i guess you would
come for now combine your crickets
roll your camel it's a 4-5 that is a
good chance to get the buff
one more level here um you can
definitely it's not incredible
but i think you can for sure combine
horses and then also like just roll
a uh a spider although three two two
three him me hit me i think we'd rather
have it outlined like this for now this
is a squad that can win or draw i i
would be surprised to see a loss but you
never know like the meta is picked up
i i love running into a dodo early
before it gets a chance to pop i hate
running into a dodo late when it's it's
already going freaking buck wild um and
we win these
feels good uh getting a sheep out of
that is incredible as well we're looking
for some kind of like permanent scaling
unit though like right now
um we're very eager
to pick up it's a nice tanky unit um
like a dog
if we could find one this is an and we
don't have to do it right away but i am
gonna do it right away
uh a snail doesn't appeal to me that
much i think we're gonna end up selling
a spider
i'm gonna roll once just to see if we
get a pill we did not
um i mean the way that you would
probably play this but let me say by the
way i've been getting kind of bodied by
crabs lately i i
look you're really going to make a joke
about the the sti
like i'm pretty sure that that joke was
invented in like the 1870s okay we
shouldn't have named them i was there
when miriam webster made the dictionary
we shouldn't have made this the same as
the parasite
that being said
we got to say crabs from time to time
there's been multiple crab situations
have have affected me uh
when it comes to uh
losing in this game i've been going up
against a lot of like you know
crab goes behind your tankiest unit
let's say it has 15 hp then you got a
315 crab but then you have a dodo that
hits it as well with like a plus 10 all
of a sudden you got like a you know a 13
15 crab behind a 15 15 unit it's pretty
nasty man
it's got me thinking we need to spend
uh imo best spend here
probably on your camel i i hate getting
just a plus one plus one but
at least we get a guaranteed yield right
now these early rounds are important man
um and we got a crab here it's only
going to be a 3 8 but 8 hp that's that's
hard to chunk through early on man
um
mercifully
we are at the very least
going to draw
and actually we're going to win by one
little surprising but that takes us to
three
just puzzling it out we're problem
solving okay straight up kangaroo is is
very good with this team
we no longer
have to have a horse honestly this can
go
number one mistake that i i think i see
at least in the chat
is people who run the horse longer than
they need to
sometimes there's
like i'm i'm not trying to be upset i'm
just looking for like literally a pill
to kill you to make space because this
team is a little
janky right now um
but
sometimes you need to run a horse till
turn 10 because you got a squad that is
like predicated upon making that work
that's terrible uh
that's a terrible situation for us there
but that's okay it's a nasty team man
look at this i i don't i don't see a way
we win this come on
nah not even not even close really
that was a very nice turtle that they
threw in there to mix me up but i think
you got to pivot off of that horse at
some point it's just the question of
when
i'm i'm actually kind of stunned at the
inability for us to get a pill i
probably rolled past some in my
life it's too late to start investing in
a dog so we're in like i mean this is
reroll hell right here
this is good please
a unit of some merit okay
we're gonna dump this cricket
a deer can a
early deer especially can do some great
work for us i don't know magus we're
just going to cup cupcake the uh the
camel there
this squad is getting pretty close to
his peak and and i blame it on me
wink wink
um but i also blame it
a lot
on like
the shops that we got i hate to say it i
hate to
wow we're gonna lose this one too um i
hate to blame it on on you know
something outside of my control as
convenient as that might be but
shops created a difficult situation for
us here but it's not over yet that's
sub-optimal of course but
we want to freeze you we really for now
we want a great unit there
probably want to freeze you too we
probably my guess is that we're looking
at something like this early and maybe a
can seems a little spicy it's a very
uninspiring theme for turn seven um but
if we make it through this one we got
some potential in our future
we really i'm surprised we haven't run
into any like white weenie builds
because the
the white weeny build is like the
perfect setup for us
to to get our camel to pog up our
uh peacock which would then allow our
peacock to pog up our
kangaroo but instead our kangaroo's
gonna die we're gonna get three wins
that's embarrassing honestly like i i do
i i put some
blame on our shops
but it is what it is this this is a
squad right here
yeah this is a squad
i think early mosquito
is actually pretty sweet it does a great
job of like uh
let's be the clumsy bikers uh it does a
great job of countering like horses and
ants which are very common
of course we shot the cricket out of all
of those uh i mean we were spoiled for
choice we had we had myriad great
options uh we're still gonna get a
loss here though
[Laughter]
literally any other shot would have
gotten us a win but that's in games
where rng applies you know that's how
that's how she goes sometimes
for now i think you freeze and combine a
fish
run an ant of the front you could make
this squad better if we had something
besides a mosquito or a cricket back
there but this is still like a this is a
good team it's a bit of a scary team
losing the horse is nice it makes that b
less good but
still like a it's a bit of a spooky
squad here but we're gonna come out with
a win
early early game one one is not where i
want to be
but it happens man life comes at you
fast so this is not a horse build right
now um
we'll start with a combine
we don't really care to make a spider
stronger
you can definitely roll a badger at the
back early
i think
we can sell a
i'm thinking
i mean i would rather
i don't know
we're at seven roll me once
if we get another fish that would change
things peacock is fine
it's
look a five six is gonna do numbers for
you here freeze this to make space in
the future hold a peacock
no you don't hold a peacock sell
your cricket
to get a peacock to possibly work here
roll once two dodos okay so now
two dodos equals sell mosquito kill ants
hope the ant hits the dodos even if they
don't you're only one away from a level
three
or level two i should say which is
pretty good we're trading with your
strong unit that's fine
that's fine that's fine
we draw a real piece
not incredible but but it's something
okay so you gotta go
uh
you gotta get in here you gotta get in
here
you gotta go
that's it's okay
then we'll do it like this roll once
uh you can definitely
yeah i mean a three six crab is not that
bad but why don't you give me a flamingo
cause the other thing we'll do is use a
pill with a flamingo to permanently buff
our dodo the dodo is scaling uh this
looks bad 913 dog kind of spicy uh level
two horse we're going up against as well
a little spicy we want to see snail
that's probably the worst that we could
have seen um yeah there's just there's
just no way this is i'm not mad at this
squad this is a common squad i would
like to have it myself you know if you
get a dog early enough
you weren't that far off actually then
the dog can scale beautifully early i
think the dog still is a little
underrated and you know the honest truth
is that turn five might not be too late
for it but
for now
um we're gonna stick with what we got
even though we're only on two hp we're
gonna we're gonna keep you around
but not necessarily forever
you can
look you remember that you get a
permanent benefit out of this like in
the in the buff here um
i still think you freeze a pill early
just for for future purposes
i don't mind a spider
that we're likely gonna use as like a
kill trigger as well and hey can i tell
you
well i was gonna say two two spider
trades with six two spider but that's
not the way hey hey
it trades with a two two snail though
are you dude honestly i'm dying with all
these
all these freaking
sheep getting summoned okay we get a
giraffe that's okay
this is still good there's still good
okay look at that we we've managed to
pull ourselves out of the muck slightly
give ourselves a chance to to get out of
this two wins two losses with a squad
that looks okay
um i wouldn't really invest in leveling
the spider up
myself but
what i would do again i'm okay with this
i think you sell this but
it's not very efficient but keep in mind
the spider helped us get a win too
um
kill a flamingo
it is four gold for two plus one plus
ones we can choose it's it's a heavy
cost
but it is what it is
a lot of people would say roll an
elephant in front of a
peacock but i think our peacock having
hp is the best scaling factor it doesn't
really need to do that much more than
five damage
in my opinion uh
but we need to put something out there
so honestly like
i think you can roll a 2-6 whale at the
front
it doesn't really
do well by like swallowing anything i
think you can just put your elephant at
the back
people underrate the value of just stats
i think and and having like a mercenary
so this is not like a cool combo or
anything like that but
this is really bad for us quite frankly
but we do really well against sheep uh
with garlic armor probably allows us
definitely allows us to at least kill
the cricket
and then this is where we're hoping our
stats come through man
and i think they will
we didn't even technically need the
elephant but
i'm happy we had it in case we went
against a slightly stronger team
you should go
i think you freeze a hippo and and keep
it for a time here we need to get rid of
our fish okay this is what you do you
sell the whale the whale no longer has a
reason to exist in a in a world with a
monkey
then
we'll hit you
shark is is great if you can make it
work i don't think we're in that
position right now we'll buy a hippo
we'll buff our hippo
we need that dodo to come up a level for
sure
and even like honestly i would freeze a
penguin and think about dumping our fish
here in a second
that's huge okay so you're gonna dump
the fish to roll a penguin it's gonna
give buffs to everything but the hippo
the hippo's gonna get buffed by the
monkey
um
we probably dump a pear and hold garlic
to make our hippo stronger now we're not
we're not quite there yet but we're
we're now at the position where we could
get there in our future which is
extremely nice
that's
we're losing
this round for sure
that's a nasty squad with but with one
hp left we have future prospects which
is the all i could ask for really so
i'll hit you
cow is beautiful i i think maybe
start start me
here then you're gonna move back one
would you buy me a cow
you're gonna laugh because the dodo does
better with the buff but i really think
our hippo having more hp hp is is the
most precious resource in this game
that's that's my hot take at least we're
getting a nice buff every turn on
every unit that's not a scaling unit and
now we just kind of hodl now we just
pray
this doesn't look too bad an ox can be a
little spicy but
we live
the ox is gonna kill us
but we did a decent number ourselves
we're looking okay we're looking better
than okay all right
at some point we're gonna go up against
the squad that's gonna make us
sweat a little bit more but for now this
is okay
you can roll perry behind monkey but i
i don't advise it
then again what do i know
[Laughter]
fair uh straight up we do want this
monkey to level up but for now
you know a quick investment in this
hippo to maybe get him to a 17 20 which
will actually be 25 20 garlic armor we
want to see weak units
doesn't look too bad but the uh
the ox is always
spicy just because of the potential
value of melon armor right
but i think we're punching through some
which is all we could ask
for then you got okay look at that
that takes us to five
we don't really need a level three dodo
but i i wouldn't say no
i wouldn't say no
i actually am a big believer in the
dragon here i think we can
like penguin gives
plus two plus two
total
monkey gives plus two plus two we can
beat that with a dragon the problem is
we can't target it the way we want to
target it but we can beat it with a
dragon i i think this will
this will be our future
but in order for it to work we have to
survive this turn
please we want to see weak units
tiger kangaroo scares the crap out of me
a bit
and then that dog at the back
it's just spiced okay like
you can see that kangaroo is getting
mighty strong mighty quick
we're still as long as we punch through
the kangaroo
i don't mind it too it looks like we're
doing okay alrighty
but plus the dragon actually has some
merit in its own right so
um there's something alike there
so we can keep a monkey for now because
it's close to leveling up but we're
gonna get rid of it soon the penguin can
go in favor of a dragon then we roll for
some level ones
as we see them we will we will be
replacing
our existing units and i think it's
totally worth it it it it comes through
fast
plus it buffs
yeah okay i it's an easier
way to buff everything this
probably makes sense
right
buff the hippo you piece
thank you
what do we want to end with
i mean honestly one of the things you
can do
is
like you run this for scaling
and then you may be just like expecting
to run up against like a possible
we do freeze that for sure well here's
the thing i think you can run a scorpion
at the front or you can run a crocodile
at the back
i would feel compelled i think i just
kind of prefer a scorpion um
and then you hope to not run into melon
armor at the front
okay
okay
um
that's unfortunate
yeah this is a loss
that's a really good team though uh they
i mean they're doing the same thing
they're doing dragons scaling i'm gonna
be honest with you i have like eight
minutes okay
until well maybe 10 minutes so we're
gonna run a turbo speed build
roll me once
i'm very happy we bought out the shop
there will be the uh vivid organisms
so we got a six and a three it's not
amazing but it's i mean it technically
puts us at a positive
uh ratio here right am i crazy
i i'm surprised the dragon scaling build
didn't quite get us there but
it is what it is
look um
it's not incredible but we
know we're gonna get at least one level
up mosquito next turn why is the ant
behind the cricket because i'm i'm a
little strapped okay i'm a little
strapped for time
you love to get at least one ko dude
this squad is doing it it's not even
close man
look at that
early game i i don't i wouldn't say the
mosquito's the best
i'm merely saying it's a little
uh it's a little overrated or underrated
i should say okay you can do this you
can run this squad so we'll do a combine
and a combine
get a turtle that's beautiful we will
totally like just roll a turtle
we will look at either pilling or
selling our ants
i still i'm still a believer here i
think you sell your aunt even though you
know the opportunity cost is kind of low
frieza mosquito
uh well
go ahead be mad
[Laughter]
here's the thing okay we we like this
no no no
um because we get the space to combine
uh as well
so like what this does is it allows us
to summon a unit get the value out of
having that unit out there and then
if only we'd gotten a ko there man um
and then on top of that we also get the
value of combining them making that
space and then using that space to you
know get through some stuff next turn um
or to summon more units for our dog by
the way we won that one we win these
maybe i've just got to turn my brain off
more often like
okay so the the way you play this you
combine first that way you get the
summon trigger
which makes a combination
um i totally think we could roll a next
level turtle if we're lucky enough to
get one
i think we can totally
we're not going to go one level up on
the cricket we might go one level up on
the mosquito just because we're kind of
already there and i for the time being i
don't think this is a dodo build i think
you can freeze a pill maybe to use with
the turtle even though it's not going to
be that uh inspiring perhaps
to to level the turtle up and then kill
it immediately but
you know
you got to think oh god golden poops you
got to think about the future here and
and the future for us
that's really unfortunate but the future
for us is essentially just um
this dog needs to be stacked it's just a
dirty team man like they're they're
strong i don't mean dirty in like an
unfair way i just mean like literally
that's a that's a strong team right
there now
would you look at this
we got the chance for two melon armors
for a single pill if we're interested an
early worm is an interesting idea um but
i'm i'm sold on this dog build right now
man
i would just like to at some point get
some hp
you can roll me once we could
technically put a cricket down but
um
i mean straight up you drop a mosquito
into the mix here
i think now
that's the play
yeah
you can honestly after the combination
you can start to think about rolling a
kangaroo behind the dog the dog gets
melon armor that kangaroo's gonna pop
like this dog is likely to be one of the
strongest units we come across
uh in the early game here
so i'm i'm not sweating this in the
slightest are you you're seeing the
punch you're seeing the punch
so there's a combine
we're not doing it on the right turn
admittedly i'm honestly i think a deer
could slap here man like i i think you
sell your you sell your cricket although
the mosquito was not long for this world
either
you run a deer up in front
you run a kangaroo just behind i'm
loving where we're at right now i know
we still got a pill frozen i regret
nothing can i tell you that i regret
nothing
um
next step garlic armor on our dog
and then freeze a dog roll me
you don't need garlic on your dog
because you're getting the melon armor
dude every time literally every time
every freaking time
um
that's okay three gold wasted we're in a
very efficient setup right now so i'm
not sweating it too too much
it's a it's a mistake don't get me wrong
that being said uh get owned
by the way i'm gonna follow it up with
the
little get owns
that's cool how you got like that one
three six six back there
yeah maybe if she's five foot one am i
right fellow sir mix a lot fans there's
five wins
um
so that went fine quite frankly
sell me a mosquito
or buy my mosquito from me
seven seven who cares maybe if it's five
foot one um this is gonna be a buff
thanks for the thanks for the buff
thanks for the buff we did not lose
thanks for the buff
thanks for the buff
little rhino action
i'm not sold man honestly i'm like
i want like a caterpillar or something
uh
for now you can roll this no matter what
we're getting some value
i think a level three turtle
sure a level three turtle does so well
against so many different uh builds
three melon armor and high hp will do a
lot
a lot
but we're not quite there yet we really
need something that can like mimic
our
uh our dog like a caterpillar but i
can't even remember if caterpillars are
in the free-to-play version
[Laughter]
anyway you know ye of little faith just
by the way ye of little faith i saw you
i saw you typing oh this squad owns you
fff rip rip rip yeah really we'll rip
this
you peace
we can can we get it we get a stat
benefit out of the can immediately don't
improve the squad too much but
it's okay i think you're gonna you're
gonna pause it right there you know we
could have gone two cans then you start
to think about maybe a worm is worth it
at that point
um this is a nasty squad that that
monkey has buffed the hippo quite nicely
the um
the turtle is going to cause us some
problems
the turkey is going to be like a late
game monster i mean you're seeing the
issue here
um
saved
not saved
not saved
saved
saved we win these
who would have thought
that seven wins
remember when i said that build was good
i actually meant uh it stinks
and we rule
so we're gonna
keep building
i'm gonna keep working towards what
we've been working towards here i
believe in the power of
a whale hey let me just tell you a fly
is awesome but
i'm marching to the beat of my own drum
here okay
i'm going to give it i'm going to give
it my own my own college try if you will
splash damage is not i mean this aux is
going to be nasty
it might line up nicely with melon armor
on our uh dog
and we might not even need it to line up
nicely with melon armor on our dog
dude we're kind of cruising huh
are we kind of cruising
are we gonna we're kind of losing we're
kind of winning
we're kind of winning
oh my god
[Laughter]
okay okay
sure i would like to
yes i would like to
there's a lot to like there um
but i i don't know man like i'm i'm kind
of happy where i stand
as strange as it seems why not give me
just like a little chili pepper on the
whale there
i can't believe we're at eight wins on
our on our rush run it just goes to show
you man like sometimes
you just got
you peace you've ruined my whale
sometimes you actually just gotta like
think less
we're at nine wins
we're in a great spot because we're like
winning early
winning early means you play worse
squads which means you have a better
chance of winning out right um
so that i'm gonna freeze melon
in case we end up going to the late game
but your your chili's doing great work
dude honestly take one of those and call
me in the morning
this scaling will not last forever
but it has lasted for now
i would really like to just win this one
and go home because this this squad does
not last into the into your turkey tiger
builds
i don't know about this one
it the the squad doesn't look that bad
okay
the peacock scares me a little bit
we get a okay you're gonna get another
trigger on that
we're gonna get a beautiful bus
you got killed by my turtle
i'm starting to elect we won we ten
winded
without even like thinking okay well the
streak continues of getting a video with
ten wins
it just goes to show you you don't need
the dream team
if you win more than drawing early on
you know you just you fight worse teams
for your 10th win you don't have to go
up against 50 50 50 50 tiger tiger fly
tiger fly turkey
thanks for watching i'm getting ready
for my stream see you next time thanks
for the support



hey everybody welcome back what are we
on we're on free to play probably for
we're on pay to win
can you believe it let me put me back on
free to play we've been rolling no wait
we did free to play last episode yeah
put me on pay to win what the
what the is this allowed you got this on
a sliding ui panel you piece anyway um
unity certified by the way
so i i should say so
anybody that's not familiar there was a
programming arc in my life
i learned how to program i uh well you
know as much as somebody can learn uh i
got into unity development i drove to
bella view or redmond washington and
took a unity test to get certified i
passed i got a free shirt my credentials
deprecated in 2019 so i don't know what
the heck i'm talking about anyway here
we go
um we've been having a nice little run
lately though
look i actually think that
the fish is the best choice for getting
the win
um
but
in this unique situation i think we can
roll a cool bird
and i'm i'm basically minimizing my
chances why not uh dry dust bunny is
also a great name but streamers is an
easy one to pick look maybe they're uh
maybe they're
what's the word pandering to me maybe
they're pandering a little bit but i'll
take it either way we minimized our
chances of winning that round to get us
some favor in the future and would you
look at that it turned out totally
freaking fine
similarly i think we do the same here
and honestly
i think you freeze an apple roll you're
gonna see if you got another fish
without getting another fish
i think that the play
is
probably this
something like that i was gonna like i
don't like to use a three gold for a one
one but
we knew that we were gonna keep both
birds out there because we you know two
birds is better than one in this case at
least um
a touch spooky but i i'm dude we're
actually doing insanely well
you are so freaking lucky you don't even
know
you don't even know
anyway gaming um
we know we want to combine
i think you roll once i don't respect
any of these units
i don't really respect any of these
units either but i think you can combine
your birds
and then buy
a shrimp that way a half decent unit
kind of
gets the value of the combination
and a rabbit is really not what you're
looking for just quite frankly um
i'm gonna roll once
straight up man
i think this is a this is a weird one i
think it's a freeze
you're this this is where we're now
thinking like
i don't want the birds by the way
um we're now thinking like in our
problem-solving mind we're no longer
thinking like uh
you know like in in the meta like i'm
trying to ambiently solve our the
problems that are presenting themselves
here we got pretty lucky there
we're gonna draw this which is kind of
amazing like i think that the draw with
the scale is pretty good right now i
know the meme now we'll do a quick
combine we got another bunny you're
basically a piece like let's just call
it like we see it okay
so give me two no give me one shrimp for
now
peel my ants
that's fine we'll live with that we're
gonna buy a second shrimp
and we're for now we need to buy a
peacock because we just need to keep the
the
we need to stay in a position where we
could possibly keep the game going
a bat is incredible you already know
this but you already knew that
so give me you at the front give me a
bat at the back and let me tell you he's
ready to crack
something like this
we don't i mean you could do pill ant
but that train has sailed
this is a freeze i'm just going to be
honest the 97 fish is really good we
just want to run into like not good
squats
we needed weakness on their fish i think
this one looks to me like it could be a
little bit of trouble
i know it's fun getting into trouble but
yeah i don't see how we make it through
this one but that fish at the back
i hate to be this guy but like our shops
have been a little cursed
we're still do we're doing our best here
don't get me wrong round five is just
like
it's just a little late for a dog
honestly
that being said
you know what i'm i'm a memer i enjoy
the memeing
meme all the things you know how they
say it uh we need the fish we need the
bat which means you're gonna combine
your shrimp uh
we can't really afford to roll
so i
i think you
buy a mosquito
yummy sell a mosquito
sure we and we're really
buying the cat um just to
have a body out there
you might
take issue with what i'm doing here just
for the record but
we're making in my opinion the best of a
bad situation
this is another loss but it's not
unexpected like are getting two rabbits
on our level ups was just disastrous
quite frankly
so we're trying to dig ourselves out of
a hole it's not the easiest thing in the
world this is a pretty good way to do it
i i like this
five gold is always a little bit of an
awkward number um
and especially when you got salad in the
shop but it does allow us to
do this and this which again is probably
not gonna be anybody's favorite uh
way to get that done but uh
i'm just trying to get us a little bit
of life man just a little bit of life
okay we got a level two bat
um
i think we got a little lucky with the
bat selection
as you can tell and this is not atypical
but we got a little bit unlucky with the
animal selection but that's okay we came
through that looking pretty good
okay hopefully it's the start of things
to come
well i certainly think you sell a spider
and i think we're now in like like bison
and dog or sorry buffalo and dog
say scale in the same way
so i think you can can
sell your shrimp i'm happy he's been
here but you sell your shrimp
then you start to think about like i
mean this is a pretty good get for us
so we got a six nine and eight eight we
don't get the cell trigger anymore but i
think that's okay we're not gonna roll a
caterpillar because we need this
capacity space and you can't get rid of
a bat like it's it's
an auto ad
it's pack one pick one
full stop zero doubt you could
um
save a flamingo but
wait we only have five well if we only
have five i i sadly think we're in buy
and then sell
and then fish or flamingo territory
it's an unusual build don't get me wrong
but we got three pretty decent units in
the front flamingo is a nice thing to
pill it's a nice thing to
um it's a nice thing to kill it's a nice
thing to thrill microbe is terrible news
hey but would you look at that we lived
through
uh both just due to you know
having a
decent amount of hp we live through that
that's kind of surprising for me
we will sell our flamingo it would be
nice to pill it but we are we really
going to spend the rolls to make that
happen i don't think so
we'll buy a spider
we get two triggers and we get a chance
at our roll to see if there's a pill i
know we just said that's not the way we
want to play it but you know that that's
different you know based on the order of
operations of when things show up this
takes us to seven
i don't really want to buy and fill our
shop with food quite frankly i'd rather
buy units that give us an upside when we
buy them um
rather than buy sell here i actually
don't really mind getting a five five
deer out there that'll summon a five
five bus give us uh a trigger on our our
dog as well
i mean this is not looking like a 10 win
you know three wins at eight rounds and
our units are not scaling as fast as i
would like but
you can get lucky
this is not gonna be too lucky but
in principle you could get oh that's
terrible luck uh you know what though oh
you live by the one hp you die by the
one hp
we we were close to a win there closer
than it might have originally appeared
so you gotta go there's a lot to like
here i think i think you have to go
we really need the dog scaling even
though the bats great like
i feel like you need that dog scaling a
little faster
excuse me
which would mean you do this
which would mean you i mean you could
definitely run a second bat out there
and get the two triggers here
kind of like this now i guess
um
we can't fit any i mean a gorilla is
pretty good don't get me wrong that's an
easy freeze that's an easy freeze oh if
we live one more level
there is some there's some hope
this squad is not horrible given the
circumstances
that dog at the back is not amazing for
us that's for sure
who would have thought man a snail could
get the job done there
you peace
seven and seven
it's just well done you
dlr dlr you you built a good squad there
i'm a little disappointed but also we
did not get the dream line from our
shops that's for sure um
you know i i think you can try
a little food build here
uh
sure i mean i guess we'll take them
we'll be the uh
hungry doggies
we getting i i can't stress enough this
current cutthroat state of the meta
it really is nasty this is a loss by the
way um but
if you
oh we were close if you find yourself
getting rabbits from like your first two
level ups like basically you might as
well go screw yourself
um i don't think a bird's the play here
you probably do better off
with something like this
and also like buying food does really
well
but it's only temporary so i'd rather
get some permanency early on here this
is another pretty scary squad honestly
that's probably the worst way that could
have gone down
and we lose again
you you really gotta have your early
game pretty tight to not
lose in the early game these days like
it's it's a little it's a little crazy
man
okay that's that's pretty good
that's pretty good
on buy food game plus two on eat food
give shop animals one health
on eat food
give friends so they're i wouldn't i
shouldn't say they're trying the
shoehorn like some kind of food build in
here
hatching chick level one is really good
by the way these are all basically
trashed here imo
straight up
it helps
i'm i'm scared but i'm also
not that scared
seven seven fish
you're a piece we're we're going down
man we're not we're not getting there
fast enough that's for sure
um this will look like a pill
this will look like a pill
i forgot you get buffed
might as well buy you
no pill that's okay
it's a little tough to for me to roll
these you can roll a dog turn four
you got to figure out what the heck
you're getting rid of to make it happen
but you you can absolutely like
have a dog function out here on turn
four
this is weird but we definitely want you
to get the buff um we definitely want
you to level up we definitely want to
freeze you for the future we might as
well keep you i get these are honestly
that's a decent hold as well but um
we just need to draw here and then we
can start to think i know by the way
you're going to look at this there's
you peace there's going to be a data
point
that says like you know dog is overrated
the dog didn't do anything wrong here by
the way we are going to go down with no
winds that's pretty bad
it's the dog all its only sin was
showing up one turn later than i would
have liked and our capacity was a little
screwed but okay let's try again we'll
be the um
maybe the illegal hats remember you
couldn't you you used to not be able to
wear hats in school
i'm here to tell you like as an adult
now
as someone who was a teacher
i don't really get it
even to this day
i thought they could be hiding something
in there in their head okay they could
be hiding something in their pocket too
there's no rule there's like no pockets
i'll roll three mosquitoes i'm not above
rolling three mosquitoes why don't you
toss me a little a little b on my
mosquito because it's actually likely to
stick around now that we know it's gonna
be our level up
like no gum
i understand it as a rule
just because
kids are gonna be kids they're gonna
stick it under seats probably they
should legislate the rule being like hey
don't put your gum under the desk
instead of just don't chew it to begin
with but i can understand plus
make the whole classroom smell like
bubble gum it's not the worst thing in
the world but
not my idea of a good time i'm buying
the owl just because like it's a good
unit honestly like it's got good stats
um
i do feel like we can shrimp here
because we got like
you have to it i know i know okay i know
that i know i know you think i don't
know i know okay you might think i don't
know i've been knowing
um
we're gonna sell
we're gonna buy i don't really care who
got that
um we're not gonna sell buy it we don't
need to freeze a pill roll me once
that's exactly what the heck we're
frickin looking for
i'm not sold on this round okay but i'm
i think that we got a good buy sell the
shrimp the shrimp is not something you
build a team around it just kind of
hangs out it might be like a utility hey
every 2017 washington capitals team
needs a jay beagle okay
and we'll let somebody else uh like jim
benning overpay for him during free
agency how does that sound you peace
sell me a fish because even at 2 4 it's
not sticking around the mosquito's
sticking for a little bit sell me an owl
that's not what i wanted to see but you
know what i can tell you life goes on
get bought
get combined
bat is non-negotiable
should have frozen a pill quite frankly
for me you have to scale the bat which
means you buy a cricket
sell the cricket
now for two gold you're getting plus one
plus one
on a random that's not great
but
i think it there are worst investments
early on at least
we got a 7-4 dog that's almost level 2.
if we could get that level 2 dog early
our strat
almost makes sense
i don't know what to think about this
one
new piece
am i crazy this looks
this looks bad
i i'm so sorry that i lost to a rat and
thus people will watch this video and
think that the rat is good
mistakes happen
the pill i mean we were spending two
gold on plus one plus one randomly i
think you can
to understand
one gold i mean technically it's two
gold because you could sell it and then
instead of paying one you'd get one but
um this is a much more
productive use of our finances you
definitely go for the level and you do
the level like this
and then please give me a good creature
it's funny because like it's good but it
it it can be good but it's the scaling
on it sucks
uh unless you can invest in it and we're
investing in you instead and you're way
behind so it is what it is
you basically
have to pick something um so welcome to
the squad you'll get sold next turn
really we'll be looking for some garlic
on the dog next this squad can do it by
the way i'm talking as if like it's
disastrous this squad can get it done
we are we had bad difference there which
is incredible
and with this is looking totally fine
this is no sweat whatsoever so the one
thing i would say is that you know don't
get too attached to the fish don't get
too attached to the bat
or sorry the mosquito
you can you can roll a turtle here i
think our mosquito at some point has to
go is that point right now
no because it's we're not gonna invest
in a fish
i would like to but we're not gonna
like it it's too late for the fish
to to be that productive so we're gonna
continue doing like buy cell strats for
a second i'm i'm holding that's
beautiful i'm holding a turtle
knowing that we could get a turtle in
the future
um that would really help us out like to
have melon armor
in fact if we wanted to because i do
like the idea of having a caterpillar
here as well
we could just give him melon armor it's
not as good early as garlic but it's
something
then we'll get a caterpillar out here
um
i love the caterpillar just because it
gives us like guaranteed levels to begin
with
sure that's fine
but it's gonna it it showed up a little
late this is not the ideal time for a
caterpillar to exist for us uh
don't cancel my melon armor you piece
that's the it's the luckiest we could
have gotten
i hate that we are dying here but that's
life baby
we win these would you look at that okay
so we want to see more caterpillars to
scale faster now we have thank you now
we have no choice but to get rid of our
mosquito i love what it's done for us up
to this part
it's the time has come
shrimp is not long for this world
but for the time being we can get
something out of it
by tier one animal okay so it's
basically like a can uh i i think
there's something to this but
perhaps not quite yet
we need we need better friends summon
give it plus two plus two and not in
battle nobody even knows what you do
let me stop you right there nobody knows
what you do two two two
straight up
you're gonna sell me you're gonna sell a
shrimp okay the time has come for it the
shrimp to be sold we don't really care
about the caterpillar buff but we we do
care a lot about the dog buff so we're
going to put the dog right there
knowing now
and we i think we def you know what i
think we can for now
and we'll we'll roll a hatching chick
just to try to win this round we want to
make sure our dog is the creature
getting buffed
buff buff no buff
we don't really you know what i actually
prefer that a caterpillar gets buff over
the hatching chick right now because
you're not going to stick around long
term so it'll be buff buff buff i'm okay
with that
this is also why i wanted to get the can
so that you know we know that a lot of
these units are actually replaceable so
we're thinking about our future for the
first time in my life um well the first
time in my super auto pets life
as long as we can punch through the dog
here
i think we we come out of this with a
draw
oh you didn't get killed by the
dromedary what the heck man that takes
us to five wins we got something going i
do see the buffalo strategy but we got
to figure out what we're dumping to get
that buffalo strategy to pop
it won't be a caterpillar it would have
to be it would be a hatching chick but
then you have to sell either a poodle or
a bat as well the bat's not getting the
buffs but the bad is a very good unit
possibly being overrated right now but
uh i
our main our victory condition is
caterpillar
plus dog as a result we need to invest
even if we lose hp temporarily we need
to invest in caterpillar plus dog which
means
for now hatching chick can go
it also means none of you
give us a benefit on buy
you're not really a huge benefit on buy
but you do only cost one gold so there
is that
i i see the problem just for the record
i get we're running into some issues
here um
not every unit that we purchase is going
to give us a benefit
so we have to be ready for that we have
to accept that
uh
i would freeze maybe like an ant here
i mean a worm is a tier four you could
stack it in the proper order to buff it
but
i'm honestly like i think you just buy
an ants
with the scaling is is nice because of
the amount of things that it hits right
now admittedly we don't really care if
it hits a caterpillar long term so
they're they're they're running the same
build right now which i actually believe
bodes kind of well for us
because we're in the same spot
we're gonna get that second dog out
there and this is like dog redemption
right now
that being said we very much wish to um
get to level two
[Laughter]
kyle is nice and you know is is nice
because you're buffing a unit that buffs
two units um
nothing i mean to be fair you could get
a bison here
uh and it would scale
it is a tier four so with a poodle if we
put him in the right spot it would scale
even better
i gotta be honest with you it's kind of
driving me crazy
my brains got me thinking the best way
to play this is we're gonna sell a bad
at some point
now i i don't believe that that can be
true
and yet here we are so you know what
it's let's just call it like we see it
right now we have a level one bat
hold on three four four
we want you to take the buff because the
poodle is more temporary we'd prefer if
our hatching chick gets the buff
over
the uh
caterpillar i suppose at this point it
just doesn't do us any benefit for we
need the bison to get the buff this is a
scuffed layout
save me
save me turtle plus caterpillar is like
that's end game status we can always
freeze the can here
all right so we're gonna have two 28 30s
one of which is gonna have melon armor
this early that's pretty okay our melon
armor is gonna get dusted but i don't
know you tell me this squad doesn't seem
that scary to me i see they're going for
like a late game turtle build but it's
too late your scaling has let you down
now we if we could shelter the bison
until the bison starts popping that
would be nice that would be a nice thing
for us
so we don't need you you're you're gonna
go
which would mean we'd pop a turtle at
the front but we don't want to do it yet
um because we'd rather get some buy sell
going on to scale the dog so if we could
get some buys that have an upside this
is a buy with some upside
how about a level two dog just just in
theory
werewolves of london hey okay uh you
know what you you sell the poodle
next turn
and you roll a t-rex in its place and
then we don't have to worry about
positioning anymore we can just be uh
good
this this has the not a guarantee okay
not a guarantee but it has the potential
to be 10 wins we're relatively early our
squad is is dynamite right now
as you can see like
we're chunking pretty well here
admittedly the melon armor is causing us
some problems but not that many
that takes us to eight wins and these
getting wins instead of draws is a huge
help as well
um we will sell a poodle
i don't think we need the can anymore
even though it would buff the t-rex
we'll buy a bison
in order to buff the dog which also
buffs the caterpillar we'll combine the
bison we'll put a t-rex out there we can
roll twice
if we see a pill we kind of gotta freeze
it we remember we need to stay at three
gold if you freeze it no no no you can't
freeze it you need to stay as a level
one
and then we confirm because we get great
scaling out of this on everybody
particularly we want our bison to scale
faster
it's in 1920 is okay but
the heck a 733 bat
this run i would just tell you it this
goes down in legends it's the stuff of
legend
if we get 10 wins after selling a bat
like selling a bat in pedowin is
that's not common rhetoric let's put it
that way
um now we're not going to get the
the summon triggers but
freeze me obviously
hold me people always go like oh it's
the last round anyway no it's not man we
could draw we got three lives left like
the the smart thing to do is recognize
that even if we
uh
lose this round
we want the scaling to continue in the
future it gives us the best chance of
winning long term so
the weakness there turned out not great
oh never mind it turned out totally fine
i don't know what i'm talking about i
think we just got uh
i think we just got 10 wins
yeah and honestly wasn't that hard
that's i don't know it's like four
videos in a row with 10 wins or
something like that we did have a uh a
zero in there i'll i'll never forget
about the zero don't get me wrong but
hey
problem solving got us there man and we
sold the bat to make it happen how about
that maybe the bat's not always the
right play for now though thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed it if you did
click the like button helps out a great
deal of course subscribe you want to see
more in the future for now he's watching
i'll see you next time see ya



everybody wake up it's super auto pets
new update day
um
so what happened today well check it out
versus it out again that means versus is
out again
you you blew it yep the first thing i
read is a dang typo
i'm just joking i mean it is a type but
whatever who cares you can now
have your arena settings be play against
your own pack or play against all packs
which means you could roll free to play
against expansion
why not
it's an easy way to mix it up um
there were also patch notes i would say
the big patch notes uh are the versus
mode works again so you can do private
lobbies which seems like a lot of fun
uh would love to set up something like
that uh also
animal changes
big ones dodo no longer on level up
hits multiple animals instead it gets
like a multiplier so i'm guessing that
that's probably level two dodo passes
its attack forward times two like double
its own attack to one unit in front of
it level three maybe three times just to
guess
bat is a one two instead of a one three
and the big one as well is that hurt
uh only gives
three bonus damage instead of five which
actually has like a material impact for
sure um we're gonna we're gonna play
free to play against
everybody it should be fun let's give it
a shot nice little preamble there um
we can definitely roll this we can
definitely roll this
i could definitely roll that i don't
know how much this will shake up the
meta um but that's okay we'll be the
adorable abs
i think it's uh it's a good sign that
they're you know they're working towards
the game oh you know what they said in
the next update as well you freaking
leavers
you peace by the way
uh we win these never mind you're not a
piece i'm a piece
they're they're working on anti-lever
technology right now
roll me
i regret nothing
um they're working on anti-lever
technology
which would mean that if you left like
enough times in this like if you
abandoned your shops um because they
were stinky oh this saves game the game
now so i don't need to constantly keep
hitting it
[Laughter]
i'm just slowing myself down um you if
you leave enough games if you abandon
enough games you will be penalized and i
i think it's an ingenious way of
penalizing uh and by ingenious i mostly
just mean rude but uh an ingenious way
of penalizing
uh your your levers
they are going to match you up
against people that are
on average five rounds ahead of you
that's so funny
okay i'm gonna
this is academic right let's try to roll
the dodo
sure um
just to see how
the new dodo works maybe there's a
you know the game exists on like a power
curve
i did it again
maybe there's some times holy crap
uh during we should lose this i think
maybe there's some times during a game
where the dodo doubling its uh impact
like that would actually be
like doubling its impact for a single
animal would actually be good
could happen you never know maybe we
could break the meta again
let's go
uh swan is like
it's def you don't need a 3-4 mosquito
out there so we can we know that this is
sellable in our future
okay um well in that case let's uh
well it is beneficial to have two out
there and then we can buff you you're a
four five this fish is gonna freaking
slap man we'll get a level two swan next
turn even if we lose this round it's not
too bad
now i do need to inform you by the uh
every time
people are gonna be like switch it back
switch it back that freaking turtle man
let's go
knocking out a unit is always going to
be good we draw these i'll take it
um
we've been on an impressive run of form
lately which is not to say that every
run has been incredible
but dude you might be able to think
about getting an early worm out there
maybe
you could stack it pretty quick
i'm gonna give it a try but that's not
to say that we're like
guaranteed to succeed like i would
please warm me
i would never suggest that
i didn't want to freeze that even though
a pair would be better let's not look a
gift horse in the mouth um
that's not to say that we're doomed to
failure but we've had like three or four
videos where we've had 10 wins which is
is really impressive
um it's an interesting badger like when
i say interesting i mean it in the way
that it annoys me because you did really
well with it but we still got you um
so i'm just saying reserve lower your
expectations a little bit because we're
we're doing better than you would expect
on average here anyway let's get a swan
going even though its stats are a little
worse than a fish the fish is more
likely to be sold because we get a great
uh financial benefit here not sold on
any of these our blowfish is also not
long for this world but we have
uh uh unless we see like great animals
i think we have an obligation to keep uh
this is a big freeze potentially uh i
think we have an obligation to to make
our
uh
yeah to make our worm that much better
even though an apple is not incredible
an apple hey an apple on a worm is a
pear you ever consider that this is
terrible news
uh that's i mean that's just an 11
13 dog right off the bat that's going to
be hard to deal with
that's very impressive
now have we run into any uh pedo wins i
don't know if we would know that yet
uh so i think
honestly six seven fish beats three five
blowfish here just in my opinion um
let's get a dodo going was i i would buy
a dolphin
i would probably say we'll freeze a
dolphin
uh just to see like where our priorities
lie after this
and i would say they lie with a salad
let's go hey hey that's not so bad now
um
let's get this warm up at the front i
think we're at that level now i still
like the dodo passing it forward here i
still want to freeze the dolphin
uh put the no no no i'll put the fish
there okay let's see
i don't feel too bad about this squad
you know once the worm starts to pop the
dream is that it don't stop every time
then every time
um
now that's
not how it's going right now but
maybe that's oh never mind we're getting
a win the sour sausages
takes us to four this is a bit of an
unusual build by my standard so i'm kind
of a happy man i'm gonna keep that
dolphin i'm gonna sell our fish i'm
going to buy a monkey
make the worm that much stronger i'm
going to buff the worm
i'm going to i'm going to up our dolphin
a little
i don't think we'll be upgrading our
swan i think you the salad bowl is risky
but i do like the potential payoff
cupcake
is basically plus four plus four and you
lose plus three plus three on the next
turn but
i i'd rather go for some permanent stats
while we're still kind of trying the
roll here
let's go
and we really want to see this dodo come
up a little bit we also probably want to
replace the meat with the melon or
garlic
it's a good start though
okay your rooster
uh it doesn't
really
save us too much
hey look at that though we win these
godfather part four the desperate
sailors five wins two losses
you gotta love how like the build
well let me rephrase oh do we absolutely
if we can get you to level two that'd be
sick
let's see
start of battle give 2x attack to the
friend ahead you know what let's start
it there we'll freeze a garlic there is
a there's something to be said about
like getting ready to sell your swan oh
but the swan
with the dragons would be kind of sick
too
like we could you know what if we sold
dolphin and we sold
monkey
we could buy two dragons
and start our scaling adventure
i'm gonna keep the monkey frozen for now
i know we got the whole oh
re-roll me
i don't think i think level two is okay
the amount we'll spend to get you there
would probably be better spent on food
but um
this is like the moment that decides
whether or not every time in that
decides whether or not this runs gonna
win basically
you're a piece honestly
level level two rooster here is
horrendous for me
yeah we just lose these
i mean you got lucky your spiders spat
out a ram if it spits out like a giraffe
i think we've got a different story
going on
i'm you know what let's let's commit to
what we got going here the dragon could
get us out of this and it would probably
be fun but let's let's
you peace
okay um
so i'll just own this for now okay i
think you sell
this is just four now i think you sell
your monkey
we lose plus two plus two this turn
we buy two of these sons of guns
we get garlic on you
freeze you unfreeze you roll once
freeze any tier ones didn't get any
probably you still freeze a can just
because it's that good this is a squad
like this we got a 35 23 garlic armor
worm at the front it should be able to
stand up to some
to some level of danger here we've
killed the turkey which is uh really
good for us killing the rooster
this still pretty bad i think we lose
this man
like this we ran into some good squads
you can't be too upset we went what five
five and four
five and four on a novel type build
that's not a a complete capitulation
this is super weird because like
i mean i think you prefer an ants
as your first one but i think you can
definitely freeze both of these uh
jovial
you left this in the patch note site in
the jovial tea bags how about that
i didn't see added new lexicons to the
gpt3 named generator we lose these by
the way
i think that was to be expected
and that that's dlc we're going up
against dlc
i'm not mad it's it's
i think it's i have no idea how it's
going to affect the meta but i think
it's kind of cool
give me for now give me a combine
you might as well roll me once
an otter is actually pretty good you can
think of it's basically like a 2-3 right
but it persistent one of the one in one
of that is persistent i think a second
ant gives us a much better chance to
like survive so if we had gotten that at
the right time on turn one i like it but
i i could be wrong by the way
like billy joel said you may be wrong i
may be crazy
this is a nice trade for us and this is
very good
okay we're one and one
this is where you want to see a pair
uh i i don't mind a flamingo but it's
not
really doing it for us i think a dodo is
still good i even with the change i
think it's still good i am willing to
go combine
and give it a try but we're still
fishing for a beaver of fisher and ants
we got an ants
i like it i like it kangaroo
it's a it's just a good animal we can't
fit it
i think you can sell your beaver
yeah and then let's let's roll like this
this is a four squad marty i just i'll
just admit it i got the math wrong
um
i think it's a four squad marty that
could hang in there though
um or not
the other alternative is that it could
not do that
is the thing
yeah two level one horses yeah this is a
complete disaster this is i am living in
despair
this is a very sad one for me because
one more crappy animal could have done
it i think because the horses are
nothing but it is what it is it happens
from time to time let me uh let me take
that early pill hit the dodo please
beautiful that's absolutely beautiful um
we like a swan just in general
i think round four is is dog worthy
you can buy a dog
then you would probably be looking at
selling something you don't really care
about
in order to get uh
in order to get another creature out
there to make your dog better so i
actually think you sell your
i think you sell your three five fish
knowing you have upside on the swan
and then you're gonna move swan to the
front dodo there dog
no kangaroo behind dodo because it's our
tankiest unit right now then we're just
gonna buy an otter and the fact that it
paid forward to the dodo is kind of nice
but this squad is is very
scuffed
it has future prospects which is very
nice but
it has some problems we don't we don't
care at all that our uh
that our otter died he's already served
his purpose here and we're gonna come
out broccoli god is a great name
all right we needed to not lose that so
a win is the probably the best option
and we'll get another dog going
we got it this is the swan is important
to give us the space to buy more things
is it's very spooky
to spend nine gold to end with one
animal and a plus
three of some sort on our dog
i think instead we gotta
we gotta play a little differently four
four three four i mean i guess for now
you would probably mix this up to here
now this is an okay buy and sell we at
least got garlic out of it which is
better than a
a one stat upgrade
without without a doubt at all um
so i mean as crappy as this looks
at least you get something out of it you
got like pill meta for the future we're
gonna have a 10-6 garlic armor dog at
the front
we live long enough
to take out the ox
then we trade there's no way the swan
gets through that horse though all right
we're on one hp already this is
getting getting sent
not going super well
roll me
you're gonna need a cell
and i think you need to have something
like this happen
but we need like garlic on the camel
yesterday
you have to move something to fit these
they're they're too good
so for now i think you dump the swan the
camel has future value for us the dodo
is is doing work i'd rather keep a 6-6
dodo than almost any creature we got
right here give me one of these
not likely um
with only five we can really only buy
one more thing
uh and the thing that i think we should
buy
i mean is is
a little
insane maybe
you definitely want to freeze that
freeze that freeze this roll once
freeze this
i'm going to be honest with you i i
don't think
this is the squad yet
this is super weird but i think you
gotta have this this tanky dog up at the
front man
and uh
we're gonna knock out their two strong
units which means we're gonna win that
actually the the fact that this worked
is a little surprising to me but you
remember you gotta think it depends how
you wanna play the game
i think if you play the game to not lose
early
that's fine you know you you learn that
way you have more fun
however um
i personally i'm like i think it's
important for us that we keep the chance
for like a high win marty in our back
pocket and the only way we're gonna be
able to do that is by
um
is by giving ourselves like the chance
to scale in the future
um now the turtle is cool but i do want
to point out now the turtle does not
give us
uh if if the turtle gives us melon armor
it doesn't
trigger a hurt effect melon it and hurt
is a synergy that is now nullified by
the new update um that being said we
would like melon armor in general maybe
this time we'd put it on the kangaroo
instead of the camel so that its first
big attack doesn't get blocked or it you
know gets through risk-free um
i don't think we're going to be rolling
a
bison is unlikely we can freeze a
penguin for the chance but i'm
pessimistic it all comes down to the dog
if if we out match them early we're
happy this looks really bad just to be
honest with you
two damage is like it's the nightmare
here yeah we're this is just the end of
us
that's fine that's fine the three wins
we're we've broken even this episode so
far let's run it back one more time
you can you can play a mosquito early it
it counters ants
it's pretty
nice honestly let's i mean two two two
that also has sell upside is okay i
don't mind the buy one one
i think it's worth you know the time has
come to learn something okay
we'll be the hungry swimmers it's a very
inefficient mode for transportation
people get
or locomotion i should say people get
people get hungry man
that's big
that is big
we win these
can you believe it we win these
i mean beaver two crickets is like tell
me you had a curse shop without telling
me you had a cursed shop two ants is
fine
be straight up with you i think you can
roll a beaver still
that's you're a piece quite frankly um
ants
most likely to live
for maybe a couple more turns so take
your little buff there we're not we're
not doing a combined and uh combine ant
and then buy duck strategy
it's just not gonna happen
hey look at this we trade with the
cricket that's nice
we
draw these
but mathematically
we were 5'4 versus 5'3 so i'm better
i'm sorry it's just that simple
uh this is a roll before a combine
this is um probably a
a cell
that's not so bad then you can roll the
second mosquito but this is not
long-term what we're hoping for i think
you got to say like you know what dodo
like you've had your chance i don't
think it's bad i just you know we've run
it twice this episode already but really
spider i think i think he would sell
like an otter
to at least get a three five like stat
lord out there
straight up i mean we're just trying to
win this round just combine me and then
toss me like a little crab man
uh no you can't do it this way you do it
this way
oh no yeah like that yeah yeah this is
okay i mean i we have no future
prospects
we didn't get like a meta defining unit
unless you maybe consider the dodo to be
one um
and this looks pretty bad admittedly
however
i don't know what the however is
supposed to be there yeah there is no
however
we lose these it's just that honestly
we're going up against the milk factory
what do you expect i thought we had an
okay chance to win that round but
life comes at you fast
look this doesn't level up okay i think
you gotta at this point
you basically gotta be like
we're gonna try a dodo because we have
two pills and we don't have many other
options that was what we needed to
happen have happened for me to be a
happy individual um
it our
math is just not good here is is
basically what is happening um
i think you could buy a a spider
though i kind of hate it um roll once
dude really
okay yeah really
i'm gonna sell an elephant mostly
because our mosquitoes close to lev well
yeah i'm going to sell an elephant i i
think we have a high percentage chance
to lose this next round i don't want to
be on the same meta by the way that
we're on right now but
i i kind of feel like uh
you again i've said this a lot recently
but you really gotta play like the the
hand that you're dealt in this game and
we got dealt a hand of like you know
they want us to play dog dodo right now
this is really bad
uh this is a loss against a good dlc
team by the way
i wonder if
okay now you got me saying it but i was
gonna say i wonder if the dlc is just
consistently stronger
i mean we've been holding our own but we
haven't been doing particularly well
doto or dog please
sub-optimal
early garlic is is mission critical
uh
let's be honest
at least the spider has some upside
uh okay
i think you can definitely try a camel
kangaroo i think it just looks like this
something like that
5 4 dog is just chilling yeah this is
okay giraffe dodo is fine uh in some
situations i think if you have more hp
to work with you might be happier with
it for now it's just a little slow for
us oh this is i mean it's dlc again i
didn't know there were so many dlc based
gamers man
hold on we're chilling like our squad is
good
our squad is okay turtle me oh we win
these
let's go
okay so that takes us to two wins
more
you know i hate to say it like the
spiders gotta go you could g more garlic
you might as well buy early you know
you're gonna want it um the spiders
gotta go to make space but are we real
you know what yes we should do it now
because the otter gives upside
you know we don't want to lose out on
that
we don't need to sell you just yet
i mean i'll sell you again
and then buy a uh
we'll buy an otter
and then we'll
sell you
then we'll buy a beaver we're not gonna
freeze ant pill it's for gold for
not enough
in my opinion at least
we like the squad set up here yeah i the
double garlic
i'm hopeful let's put it that way seven
five dog is not that impressive but
seven five uh dog plus garlic we start
to think maybe he's got a chance okay
a lot of this is gonna come down to
how good is the spiders uh
how good is the spider's animal we want
to see like a snail
that's probably the worst we definitely
lose these
[Laughter]
that's just really good honestly i mean
we we lived and died based on that ram
last time so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
pretend that it's that bad but
that's that hurts that hurts so you
gotta go
we're gonna try yeah i mean the dogs we
i i'll
you know we gotta go on pay to win
although i think dogs still exist in pay
to win as well but um
i don't know how much this is gonna help
i mean there's something you know what
forget the dodo buff for now
i thought i had way more gold than that
what's wrong with me um
honestly freeze me because you're a
great uh buy sell
this this is this is a collapse man
what is this team
this is the value of this early monkey
man
holy bursh
yes i mean that's a loss but look dude
i'm you got to respect the shrimp scampi
build how did you get the
are we on the same level
did you get three 1818s
i mean the kangaroo doesn't start as in
1818 i guess
i guess dog monkey
shrimp could get you there but you know
what i'm we're learning okay
this one we got our butt kicked but
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed it
if you did click the like button check
out the new update i'll see you next
time see ya



pets i i gotta tell you here's some
spoilers for you as i say will we get
six wins or more here's some damn
spoilers for you okay
i think we've we've had
three to four videos in a row
where
we have gotten 10 wins
i had a video i recorded today
you're not gonna believe this on the pay
to win build
i sold a bat
i sold a bat
the must-have unit the pack one pick one
mr auto include himself i sold a bat
went 10-1 can you believe this
you know can i tell you another thing i
sold the bat
before i sold the damn shrimp now i'll
also tell you i recorded a video today
where i went winless in one of the runs
but anyway here we go
now that now that we've massaged the
bets for believers a little bit
we did do a shrimp scampi a little
shrimp scampi at the time i gotta tell
you not optimistic with our start here
but i think this is the best thing we
had going on
i'll be the suspicious turtles how about
that
is not an incredible start
we lose these kill the bird you piece
you needed to kill the bird you piece
this is this is this is a draw
it's a draw holy crap it's a draw
sus
among us
i forgot i do that all the time i am
like what the heck is going on why are
people typing sus or are we being like
raided right now then i realized i
called my team the suspicious turtles
that's that's on me
it's not your fault that's on me
squad's getting filled out nicely here
it's so stupid that in my brain i'm like
you just gotta think for two seconds
right
um
what's better
having two mosquitoes that hit for one
damage randomly
or
three crickets that summon a one one
that are a one two and then summon a one
one when they die like
i mean it's the easiest thing in the
world you are in my head i'm like i want
to keep the shooters on me but like my
heart says give me a combined let me get
a 3-3 out here and then we got three
crickets bringing up the rear
i think they're mostly equivalent sure
actually on this squad if we had somehow
managed to kill like
two animals maybe we could have done it
what the heck is a 7-4 fish
by the way we win these
i think this is a great example of uh
why you don't invest in one big unit
early
anyway um
here we go
dude you gotta take an early caterpillar
we don't really have anything that plays
off of it but
in two rounds
aka round five this will scale like a
son of a gun
so we get you out there no question
then we can roll one of you and and
search for that cheeky level up
we are getting a cheeky level up and you
know what i will take it as it lies
i will take it as it lies
i'll freeze you for now i think we could
end up rolling a 5-3
uh for one round then selling it in two
rounds
that's that early caterpillar even
though it has nothing to play with yet
it's that's sick man that is that is
nasty
now i do think we're losing this one
no question
the untouched sausages
you know what we have no need to sell
i do a turtle and a caterpillar go
insanely well together even though this
one is not popped yet
but we need something that scales
that's just i'm just being straight up
with you
freeze me for a moment just just freeze
oh you need a dog it's it this is just
how you play the game so you sell this
you play your dog out there
then you sell the owl hope it hits the
dog
that's okay because it like works for
now but
um and you know you got to do it
like this
the dog needs to scale even if we lose
the next two rounds the dog has to scale
for our caterpillar to be good we're
gonna get there i i fully believe in the
getting there
any percent batlist runs incoming
i see great minds think alike by the way
we draw these that's a big draw
it looks bad now but the scale
was kind of crappy but the scaling is
beautiful in our future
uh a beetle is not long for this world
we need we need a flex position here
sell this beetle
i i hate to say it but uh
you know the pig value it exists
we need
our all like here's the way i see it
okay worm
worm and dog are
well you know there's something to be
said okay
i see what you're talking about i think
worm and dog are incompatible
but
because you need the money to either
invest in buying units for the dog or
food for the worm but you could roll
worm instead a dog you know what
chad's got me they got me interested
here let's give it let's give it a try
obviously it works very well with the
caterpillar
yummy yummy
we are gonna need another unit i think
for now you just embrace the fact that
this is not
incredible
and you try something like this
four four five yeah no i like this i
like this okay we might lose this round
this would be a big draw
we don't sweat that too much
love me some very very well-suited melon
armor that's the dream
this is also the dream
you're a piece you're a huge piece
whatever we win these somehow
very surprising win but we'll take it
um the cricket is not long for this
world
so we'll say goodbye to the cricket the
turtle is is top tier the turtle's an
incredible an incredible piece this is a
2-2
we can save a hatching chick to make our
worm that much better
people are like don't don't do it don't
[Laughter]
on the other hand
and the other hand
you could do it you ever consider the
frank that you could do it
you could combine and you'll pop faster
who cares you go from a six nine to an
eight eight who roll me once please
this is scary okay it's a little it's a
little scary
but that that's you get the like the
luxury of that you're a piece by the way
just for the record you get the luxury
of that because of the fact that we uh
we won our last round that i mean that's
just bad difference what can you say
our our best unit got hit with uh got
hit with a bat like you can't cry about
it i mean i guess you could
we're getting two level ups next turn
i mean i'll be honest snail's like kind
of sick
we don't need this it just it it doesn't
function
call me crazy here
dude i'd rather
i'd rather get the cupcake
for the permanent plus one plus one a
better chance to survive this round and
we get the temporary five five we don't
need the caterpillar it doesn't need to
apply we can just wait on you for a bit
uh
and we'll get well-timed level ups i i
prefer this i i prefer this we just as
long as we don't get bad difference
everything's good here
don't don't
okay that
can you say right like
sometimes it just happens
um
i'm still a believer here i mean here's
the thing turtle in front of worm yeah
it does great uh in order to uh counter
a bad difference but we'd much rather
have a garlic on a worm and then the
caterpillar actually getting the armor
but anyway i i'm still a believer in our
overall strat here like if it was gonna
pop now's when it's gonna pop
i'm still a believer
i'm full i'm fully in the believed here
just can me for the future
please no bats
okay i i see a a 25 24 bison
and yet i see oh you got double melon
armor you're a piece we lived we lived
we lose these
[Laughter]
i mean that's just rough man
that's just rough i'm just gonna be
honest like look
this is a rare situation you gotta admit
damian i saw i saw the message the first
hundred times it was posted you can you
can use your clipboard for something
else okay
now your clipboard's watch has ended
i love you i'm sorry i'm just saying
i when we had normally
chad tells me what to do i say no let's
not do that we lose chat goes my
strategy would have won rarely i find
myself in this situation
where
i wanted to keep the dog chad said nah
worm's the ticket we went with the worms
honestly we keep that dog that's a
10-win imo hold on did i run it back
i did i got to pop it out there we go
there we go
they also said you can't go double
caterpillar
they say a lot of things
let's give him something to talk about
that's what i always say
okay this is the exact same start
for the bear heads
chad also hates scampi that's true chad
chad does not respect the scampi build
um
which is fair because the scampi build
do be uh like pure garbage this is a
loss here
good
good
the other thing is though like
the scampi build is so much fun
i i've had some runs where it it did
okay but it usually does okay in spite
of scampi not because of scampi
we draw these
it's so close to a win man come on
okay round three honestly the shops were
not amazing but anytime you can get an
early level up you always say okay now
this is pog you throw a sheep out there
possibly the best turn 5 unit
or a tier 3 unit that was kind of close
there
um
honestly here i'm gonna combine and roll
but a meat is pretty good too
did we we lucked out honestly because a
bat is just insane
yeah we don't i'm so stupid like i i'm i
was like dude let's freeze the scampi
what's wrong with you
okay i see i see we have some gold and
poops
oh what are the quinces you have a bat
as well
who would have thought oh wait everybody
by the way we win these nice golden poop
dopey
you almost got to my third animal
i'm taking the level up early i'm not
looking to gift horse in the mouth
you're crazy for this one all right um
imo you dump
you dump that mosquito you just leveled
up you pick up a caterpillar
it's it's so early you gotta respect it
and then straight dude we got a lot to
like here okay straight up
give me one of those
straight up sell me
and then i'm like buy me
and then i'm like freeze me and then i'm
like roll me and i'm okay we'll chill
we'll chill here
two bats is pretty good too but
i'm not a i'm not over committed by the
way to the
uh caterpillar build
this is a huge loss
you got to respect the stats on on these
units man
um
i just you see one early you got to do
it if that makes me over committed then
sure i'm over committed source dude just
trust me
okay now a caterpillar is our strongest
unit
if you have to you can roll two bats can
i tell you something you're not gonna
like
even though this will disappear when you
level up temporary garlic is gonna
really increase our odds of winning in
my opinion
i would say honestly i think you you
combine you now have a
1013 bat
with garlic armor
and club sauce save me a turtle for
future reference
i'm a big fan a 1013 caterpillar is
gonna is gonna destroy you
the the thing we're most scared of is a
turtle
oh baby
okay so you're not wrong what is what is
the caterpillar gonna hit the answer is
right now i do not know
we need something to scale which is why
you want honestly like a a buffalo would
hit the spot right here
a buffalo would do the job nicely
let's be honest this sheep has no reason
to exist anymore
i i hate to say it man i hate to say it
a level two turtle would hit the spot
of course you could always just pill it
but
that sort of thing isn't my bag baby
someday the chipmunk will have its
comeuppance
i think that
my my personal opinion on the chipmunk
is that for it to have uh any
chance of being good they need to do
something comical like they need to make
it so it fills the shop with food and
like all food is
one cheaper or something and if they can
do that then then maybe
this is a really hard one like
we
like the dog is here but it's way too
late
it has to happen like we need something
that scales
in order the caterpillar needs a target
right now it's being like debuffed the
llama is gonna take too long in my
opinion
is merely one man's opinion but
i think you have to try to get a dog
functioning here
and it it pains me a lot because it's
not good
it is like so late in the game for it to
be trying the work
but
just get it started here you you can
temporarily roll a deer
high chance of losing
keep that
no not not today
you know okay now
i'm willing to admit my mistakes in life
you can sell that you can roll a bison
you can hold the bison
uh
and get you to level up faster
yeah yeah yeah
well we'll get no buff on this turn but
a buff in the future
freeze me again
i didn't freeze the caterpillar i i why
was i freezing a snail instead of a
caterpillar what was i thinking
it's all right every time this happens
we get one in the miracle shop so i'm
not sweating it
this looks fine by the way we got a
little lucky like i wouldn't dispute
that but
there's win number four that was just a
horrible build i'm sorry to say
if we have to wait one turn we can wait
a term oh hold on five four two three
well him me him him me
extra scaling on the bison would help us
out a great deal
even at the expense of our caterpillar
for one turn
we don't really care for the deer freeze
me
roll me
it is what it is
golden poop
bit of a scary squad not an unscary
squad
that was pretty good though
do we roast you and toast you no not
this is a loss that's a good team though
we're on one life okay so this we needed
our level three and we got it
you sell the deer
life comes at you fast you buy yourself
a little snail
you sell me
you roll me
shut up you peace
[Laughter]
we do really want a turtle now look i'm
just gonna be honest i'm freezing it for
now because we can
like if we have literally no other
option
then they might start to look somewhat
attractive
um
i mean of you're gonna roll me one more
time
under no circumstances are you allowed
to speak to me right now
we're gonna lose the garlic early
double deer the iron the irony is that
this would be a great time for us to
have a
our deer
whatever we lost both poodles literally
nobody cares
this seems really bad
although
although
oh no
okay okay
okay okay it's way too late for you
don't make me laugh
in lieu of other things you must have
some garlic
salt pretty much straight dogged here
okay hold we we need to keep you in
front of the poodles which is
stupid
[Laughter]
um
like the hatching chick is a very nice
it's basically like a cupcake
but it's good um
but how the heck so i would run a
combine
it has to be done i guess we could sell
and then also we could have bought
another thing but then like this
yeah
is weird but it's okay
chocolate
help out our bison a little bit
honestly we're into some good stuff more
more than anything else we need some
melon like some permanent melon
and preferably like a turtle replacing
this hatching chick and a poodle getting
out of here as well
freeze a weakness on the ant you piece
you're a piece you're a piece
holy crap we draw these
bison scaling beats poodle scaling for
us because the bison scaling also hits
you
bro bro it's gotta be done okay
nothing but respect for my dragon
everybody's got something to hide except
for me and my dragon
i prefer it over the hatching chick give
me a chance here take a chance on me
terrible plays
this by all accounts this should be the
largest loss anyone's ever experienced
in their life
this is just absolutely horrendous news
for everybody involved
basically look five wins is okay
it's a it's a doubt no doubt about it we
just our build popped too late
it popped too late
we ran into an amoeba
it happens
you hit the wrong payout
delete delete delete go back
all right it's not the first time it's
happened
it's not the last time it'll happen
there's sadly there's no
there's no control z
my streamer my streamer
you ever see um office space where peter
reveals
his plan from superman 3 to the boss he
slides a letter under the door
and then he decides that it's bad and
the building burns down
if you're a believer you just got you
just got office space okay
i don't know
the only thing i'm saying is have we
ever done this before have we have we
ever done the opposite i should say have
we ever paid out the doubters by
accident or do we always pay out the
believers
when we make a mistake i think it's
always been the believers
just that you know what being a doubter
i apologize being a doubter is uh is a
risky business for for multitudinal
reasons last time it happened it was the
doubters okay
well then i don't feel as bad but
we'll be the clumsy streamers look at
that it's perfect
this is a good squad people will look at
this and think it's a bad squad because
the beaver is an uninspiring unit yeah
get uninspired there you go
now here
i'll take a 2 3 fish
three ants
i'm just gonna tell you three ants
starts to hit diminishing returns
that's probably not the way to do it
it happens it happens i saw those ants i
knew i had to be a believer
i saw her ants now i'm a believer
not a trace of doubt in my mind it's
like they knew man
we win these let's go
yeah i think dude 2-2 beaver that has
cell upside there's there's some value
there
now this i mean we're going to have a
5-4 ants
level 2
that's pretty solid um
let's just be straight up with one
another
this shop is pure dog
now it's not though because a swan
is kind of sick you freeze me we're
going to get ready to possibly sell it
we're going to get ready to absolutely
sell
a beaver
thank you so much to roll a second swan
now this is a this is a good looking
squad quite frankly
especially if we can get a fish or a
swan in the next two turns
this is looking like a decent early win
squad
that sucks but you know they spent don't
care didn't ask plus you spend three
gold on meat
we lose these you know what well done
well done jada shouldn't you be hosting
the red table
talk on facebook tv right now
look you can be a hater all you want
turn four dog is actually functional
you can actually build something off of
this
um you don't have to go
you don't have to kill this ant yet
you could buy a spider and possibly kill
the spider
that's insanely good
that's like an unbelievable get
holy
birch that yeah that was
that's a bit of a new one for me
um
personally imo
you're gonna laugh at this i think it's
a buy
i was gonna say sell pill or pill sell
but that leaves us at two
but then i think it's a sell
you might as well roll a 4-3 out there
why not man
freeze that pill for the future capacity
is going to be important
the dog
is bad until it wins you the game like
that's just what it comes down to man
this is a horrible squad by the way that
we're going up against you gotta respect
it obviously they're rolling like some
rabbit shenanigans but i'm not sweating
that
it's a big
you gotta get sold because you're
irrelevant
please please please please okay
it's not ideal
we can temporarily roll a hatching chick
without a doubt
certainly you can buy a fish
and combine a fish
it's not the units we are most
stoked to get the buff but it's okay
um you can definitely sell a fish it's
an a7 man
you don't need to sell a fish what are
you talking about just put the sheep out
there move the dog further back in the
line
don't be a peace dude
now admittedly
i mean you
like you can
sell something and then pill a sheep
if you want to go truly insane
because you get the double summon
trigger off of it
you're a piece man
whatever you you're like you're you're
made of paper after we get through those
first two
animals there no sweat dude
no sweat
sheep pill is it it does give you some
gold which is funny too but um
like i gotta be honest with you i don't
think the swan is long for this world
right now although i do appreciate what
it's done for us up to this point
then you pill the sheep and this is
where you're going loco man
but
you get two triggers
you get two sails you get you get a
scampi going with that like
lord lord only knows what what happens
to you
you're a piece i'm i'm not i'm not not
for
at the cost of two gold it's too much
i'll buy a turtle
i'll kill a turtle i don't give
a
don't you know i'm loco don't you know
i'm loki
certainly one of the stranger looking
squads you'll ever see there you go
that's big that's big i don't think you
freeze you but i definitely do like a
turtle
this is a weird squad man
hey hey you never know what that that
one one is probably useless for us but
that 2-2
you never know
the early game's all about like one big
unit
look at that
don't get done
now you're probably gonna want a bat
if we're being real you're probably
going to want a bat at some point start
here's the thing combined looks great
but we could also just get one extra
gold
by saying screw your combined
and then buying you
and then selling you let's go and then
buying you
and then combining you
then rolling you
we don't need a turtle if we already
have melon armor
you roll a very simple bat strategy
you can fit a deer in once we get a pill
for this
sure why not
puppy i'm a big fan of the puppy if they
could just give us the puppy
uh on time instead of like on turn seven
it's too damn late
sorry i didn't mean that to be so
aggressive towards you
it's just like it just it just pisses me
off that they think they can get away
with this stuff
i like this this is good we're on five
wins we're feeling okay
i'm rolling it's it's an ambitious role
i'll admit but i wanted something out of
the flamingo if we can't get it we can't
get it okay if we can't get it we can't
get it
you gotta go man i hate to say you gotta
go you're an eight seven
i ate salve in you
but you gotta go if you go and you know
what you gotta go too you're a piece you
gotta go
buy me
buy me
combine me for no reason really except
that i also want a sheep out here
that's not where you're going to be
long-term don't worry
just straight up i'm like you take one
of those
this dog's going to be kind of sick okay
the deer's going to do some good golden
poop piece of crap
yes
ah man i would have felt terrible if you
didn't have a bat too you peace
oh oh oh oh oh looks like my dog beats
your dog
okay buffalo
works
very similarly
to the dog you can get a little double
scaling there
roll me
i i'm merely asking you for a single
pill you piece
you can go you'd
roll me you peace give me a pill you
i'm going to lose my damn mind
this is my damn mind okay you get out of
here you're a piece
give me one of those
give me one of these
give me one of these
we accept this
i'm a little stunned we're six wins deep
on round nine with this but
freeze the front all right weak in the
front we get the front
that's why you don't mess with the bat
we draw these
six wins
keep it coming man keep it coming
this is the pill i asked for for so
freaking long
check this out
sell me
buy me
me
love me love me
say that you love me
i don't care about anything but you
roll me
freeze me
we spend no more gold
you're not gonna stick around for life
but you're sticking around for for
right now
t-rex turned 10
kind of popping we should have put that
on you but alas
uh oh you're dead
uh oh i'm dead uh oh we're both dead
we lose these
i don't know how to sap
[Laughter]
hello daniel thanks for the ray villa
hello hello we got one life to play with
here toss me one of these
toss me one of these
roll me once
honestly that's gonna be a big time
freeze in my world
and then we stall we stall here
i am okay with this i'm oh please please
me
it's not quite good enough
we live though we live though okay
you're summoning some good units
kind of
it's a little nasty
you know what
we lost to a better team
wait until you hear about dan's isaac
run let me guess you tunnel vision on
trying to get the r key
spend three hours trying to do it and
then at the end got a clip where he got
to say don't tell me we're never getting
the r key
it's it at this point it's starting to
be a little bit like uh by the way pay
out the believers it's starting to be a
little bit like a marvel movie you're
like there's no way ant-man's gonna beat
yellow jacket not only does yellow
jacket have the equivalent powers
to uh
ant-man but he also has that killer
instinct like he's going for blood
instead of uh just fighting for honor
and then oh he did it
who would have thought
[Laughter]
if it ain't broke don't fix it i hear
you welcome back to nl plays the binding
of isaac um
yeah i'll take a mosquito i don't
disrespect the mosquito
foamy fishes all right early winds this
time please early winds
that's nasty don't shoot my ants you
shot my ants
we lose these that's a mosquito
difference
you can play this
you can play this
there's some playability involved
this squad's not so bad honestly i'm
just gonna say it i don't if it offends
people like i honestly don't give a crap
at all if it offends people pig is the
actually the worst tier one unit
it's only good within the cons
the confines of a selmy build
if you can get triggers on buy and sell
then it's kind of sick otherwise the 2 2
is like it's just not it doesn't do
anything
duck exists yeah but doc scales you a
little bit i by the way i think duck is
trash too i mean i made a mistake
when i put duck i think it like the b or
a tier in the in the tier list that was
a mistake
um in hindsight but
the
the pig is not good
anytime i see a pig in the early game
i'm like
we win
now they
proved to be true here doesn't mean it's
going to prove to be true forever but
we need the level up here
for certain
they just every time
every time
they do i i want to roll you could give
me a puppy
you could give me i don't even know what
else they got at tier three but you
don't need to give me a caterpillar
every time but on round three when you
get a caterpillar you have to go for it
it's just that simple
you know it i know it
now we need a scaling unit as as soon as
possible
i'm going to be honestly i think you've
i mean honestly that you sell this son
of a gun i think you're you're going to
end up rolling a second beaver in there
for the time being
you
it it just works okay like sue me it
just works okay caterpillar dog you have
to give it a try it would be very nice
to not lose this one
that seems okay
even a draw would be fine
we draw these
caterpillar dog how original hey i gotta
play the runs that i'm dealt okay i
believe me when i say
don't hit my caterpillar you piece
i can live with this
believe me when i say i would rather
roll a different build but like you know
what are you gonna do
they get they give you this you gotta
you gotta give it a try please you piece
sorry
caterpillar fighting early is okay
i am eager i i i haven't
gotten up the devs you know what about
it you know i think that the game is is
popping
but i am eager now i'm like we need a
new expansion
like uh
like mixing in some sets i'm i'm
starting to get i'm ready
am i am i willing yes am i able i
wouldn't go that far
this is a nasty team man
some some new sets would be it would be
very nice it's still early it's still
early
this is this is how you get to believer
status
that's going to be a big sell me that's
going to be a big buy me
that's going to be a big sell me
barristan
that's going to be
a very nice deer
i gotta be honest with you
this 4-5 mosquito
i'm a disbeliever
in its long-term chances
toss me a swan instead
there's some you know what that's okay
there's something alike here
good great bus
great bus
holy birsh
we lose these
are you kidding me man
that is it's actually the greatest
garlic armor that's ever existed
i thank you
i'm still not sweating it maybe that
makes me crazy i'm still not sweating it
you're shut the frick up
don't hit my deer
honestly like the game is a doubter what
do you want me to say the game is
doubting
and now we got a roll of four squad
marty
so everyone's gonna scream la ma la ma
llama no no no no no we do this we hold
you we hold that sheep
hey but are you you're neglecting your
llama could have become a four seven
freeze me peace four squad marty's don't
lose it's just that simple
oh son of a
oh no
that's terrible news
they're literally us but stronger uh by
the way we lose these okay pay out the
doubters
we'll throw in a slash marker there real
quick



slash marker sap one all right we're
gonna go back to the free to play build
start that prediction
hey 75 percent of the time we paid out
the right squad
you're ruining my finances eggman hey oh
caesar's palace why are you taking my
money without my consent
caesar's palace dude i it's so i i can't
my credit card statement it's crazy
fifteen hundred dollars for my caesar's
palace bill this ridiculous man they
gotta lower their prices
okay hold on put me back on the free to
play
this is a good free to play squad this
is cosmopolitan
we get a little bit of efficacy from
everybody involved we're gonna say no to
that horse for now
i don't mind being the foamy feet
you peace
you peace
we
draw these we draw these mosquito
difference we draw these
how do you not have the golden poop yet
uh i find the golden poop garish
it's like you ever see um
i'm willing to let this ride
you ever see
people out there that are wearing like
the uh a gucci t-shirt but it doesn't
have like a little g on it it's good
gucci gucci italian flag italian flag
gucci gucci gucci gucci gucci look i'm
not saying designer stuff can't be nice
i'm just saying when you're
clearly a big part of the designer stuff
for you is letting other people know
that you got designer stuff
that sort of thing isn't my bag baby and
that's what we got
with the golden poop the golden poop is
be like basically being the guy who's
like
you know i bought the 500 you're rich
app for the iphone when it came out
you don't you're not along for this
world
this is a weird setup right here i think
you can try to get a a a peacock to go
but you can also temporarily just roll a
temporary swan
um
and then we're hoping an ant payout
hits
this or this but whatever it happens
let me level up you peace
honestly you're the most likely unit to
succeed
put me right there i like this i like
this setup it's okay
don't care didn't ask plus you're you're
rolling an otter
what are you thinking
we win these
and now what's your burnt to a crisp
ideal level on a pizza crust
um
i like a crispy crust but i don't
necessarily like it to be crispy because
it's burned i like it to be crispy
because it's thin
that's that's my platonic ideal at least
just gonna level with you this this
cricket is getting a disproportion
disproportionate amount of attention
for winning us rounds when it has not
won us rounds it's merely been last on
the team of winners
i will take a swan
the shops are doubters right now
there's no question about that the shops
are doubters
take one of these and call me in the
morning
whale eating a spider at the back there
really makes you think
please i want to see a snail
another whale is also not good for them
that's that's wonderful news
we get through their strong units
we draw these we draw these okay we'll
take it we lose these i forgot you had a
spider in your stomach
please i i just want to know what
leveling up feels like
i would like to acknowledge we should
have killed the flamingo first if we
were gonna do both because we could have
controlled for what the flamingo hit it
wasn't random that was just unfortunate
we we could keep you but is it the right
thing to do to keep you
i mean it might be for like a round but
let's let's not get stuck on that okay
i'm gonna be straight up with you man
and be straight up with you we need to
get something going
the way that i feel like we get
something going you sell a fish
you buy a blowfish
knowing that you at least have the
ability to buff it
we're going to keep you for a bit we're
going to sell you we're going to freeze
you because you're like a get out of
jail free card
honestly you can call me a punk if you
want i'm buying another one i'm
unfreezing you i'm rolling once more i'm
getting one of those goes very well
actually you know what garlic goes a
little bit better on a blowfish we don't
need a turtle now we'll settle for a
late turtle
this now gives us a chance
i do see a turtle at the back okay a
dodo
it's a nasty fish man
okay we lose these
what's our hpn 2. i can work with this
this is workable
this is a combined
kangaroo
perfect kill
forget the dodo is that
it's not too late but we can pick up a
level one dodo in two turns after a can
or something like that and feel like
we're we're living on the moon okay
we have no re well
roll me
you're a straight up piece man
freeze me
for squad marty
for squad marty with equipment i can
live with this
hit that spider
okay kangaroos oh my god but you're
that's good it's good you're replacing
the the meat on the
turtle some saving
any any fans of being saved in chat
we really only needed a two squad marty
on that one apparently
i told you a can was coming
you peace
now we got a squad
now we got a damn squad
now we got a squad
now we got us we got one hp to play with
i fully expect our camel to get one
tapped even though he got uh
he got cans holy jesus christ
are you kidding me man
what the hell is this
what is this nightmare squad dude
okay you gotta go thanks for never
getting another mosquito you know what
now that i think about it that might
have been my fault give me a can
give me a monkey
give me a buff
no
give me a roll cause garlic would be
better for now than a pear
we're close we're close
you're a piece
please
please we need three wins
it's the same squad
please please
yes
blowfish difference blowfish difference
oh
oh
man i'm you but weaker exactly exactly
round nine perfect timing screw you
nobody cares although a 10 8
a 10 8 that smacks you know what
see you swan
plot composer made those songs when he
was 19. that's the kind of thing that'll
piss you off
but honestly i i feel like um
there's
whatever
everything in life works in a series of
trade-offs right you know whenever one
door closes another one opens or vice
versa
when you're young you have less
experience people are like more
surprised when you do something that's
so incredible but the flip side of that
as well is that when you're young you're
unburdened by the inspirations that
you've had
um and i think it maybe it's a little
bit easier to have an original idea
because you're coming up in in a world
uh you know of your own creation instead
of inheriting it from the
the people that you've been watching for
you know 40 years or listening to for 40
years
just my two cents i'll get a level two
blowfish pop in here
you gotta try
snake's pretty good
i would like to fit a cow
i'm just not a i'm not a believer in its
in its long term gameplay
i'm can me
this is i'm not going all in for the six
win i'm trying to get this one to go as
long as possible we may regret it we may
be ashamed of our words and our deeds
that's pretty good starts so far
decent start so far
you peace you peace all right we lose
these
all right
dude the the level of build that i
almost paid out the wrong squad again
the level of build we're going up
against here is crazy like
i know that this is
you know you've heard it from time and
time again
but uh
is is making me laugh
when i play offline
i don't run into squads like this
like i i still run into some tough
squads but i don't run into squads like
this
this is the streamer effect right here
yo this is a squad man
this is a squad you go like this
you go like this
you go like this
we don't do anything from that point
onward so this is pretty good though new
bed
it's
running as we speak
will be the lazy
be the wet wet chunks
uh we
win these by the way
we draw these by the
way bet over already
are you in a time distortion bubble
is is a is a large
uh black hole descending upon your how
do you live near the large hadron
collider
we play 40 minutes of super auto pets
people go it's felt like it's 10 hours
we run the bets for a full minute
they go it was over in two seconds this
little maneuver is going to cost us 80
000 points it's crazy
it's a minute every time
tell me your your christopher nolan's
first cousin without telling me you're
christopher nolan's first cousin
we can we definitely roll a cricket here
we could do a sell otter buy something
it would have to be compelling
it's not
mobile users get later bets
don't care plus didn't ask plus
drag your laptop to starbucks like
aubrey plaza
i mean your your desktop that joke would
have been better
if i'd gotten it right okay so they want
me to roll dog again
they've shown me dog ergo they want me
to roll dog but dog works well if we're
gonna continue doing kind of like a
pseudo horse so on round three you gotta
at least give it a try
thank you
we can definitely roll a sick buy and
combine
look for a rounds
you could do worse
but i gotta i gotta be honest with you
as much as i hate a spider
there's pill strats it works well with
horse it works well with dog like we can
roll it for it for the time being i hate
to say it though i i hate to say it
we i would have loved to have summoned
the giraffe so it could have said
giraffe
that kangaroo is going to be a real
piece of [ __ ] huh you know what we need
to see
we need to see
a turtle please a turtle
you're an actual piece we lose these
it's an early strong kangaroo you accept
it
it happens
sometimes you got to cut your losses we
can't have three prospective units all
looking for a pill
it's just not done
you gotta i'm sorry spider for the time
being you gotta go
heavy you peace energy
bro i'll freeze you we're gonna get a
pill at some point
just give me give me some half decent
shots man this is getting it's getting
to be a little much
okay these are big
big
we draw these we draw these okay we draw
these
just would like some units that are
units that i
would like um
okay i see the place
we have to we have to try
give me a
combine uh
i did not mean to buy a turtle
i mean that's based
turtle friend um
ant hits dodo
look it's still a 2 3 for a turn
but you're a piece freeze me seems like
a high percentage chance things could go
wrong here you can definitely roll a
kangaroo
just want to see a pill at some point if
that's not so much to ask
two one five
peacocks
what
i'm not believing ever again we just won
i mean we rolled up against possibly
like the worst squad i've ever seen but
i'm gonna be straight up with you one
three dodo that sort of thing is not
inspirational
um
i mean this horse is
it no longer at level one with no
prospects like get out of my face
me something man
give me something
okay
thank you
i'm gonna i'm gonna go nuts i'm gonna
peel you
we break even we get one it's not the
outcome we wanted but it does it's been
known to happen i'm gonna give me a
quick little flamingo buff we're gonna
look for another pill
hmm
you know what i'll freeze a double
turtle
and then straight up you want to win
rounds you could do worse than a cupcake
two four level one
a dodo meat kangaroo
it's got me feeling a certain sort of
way
but do we chunk you
i do i do feel like you are being
chunked right now
i love the energy of someone sighing in
chat as we with the believer flare as we
easily win
okay now
uh my preconceived notion of what's good
based on having watched him exclusively
in the past doesn't jive with what he's
doing right here but then again he won
anyway
okay now
these are big can plays okay
it's a good can
followed by one of you
followed by one of you
then it's a little weird
you need to buy the turtle
imo
i'm just gonna put the melon armor on
the dog
for now i want you to keep the meat i
want you to get the two buffs
this is not permanent but this is
this is the squad for now we're hoping
for a pill soon
as long as we kill
a camel
it's not looking great
although
oh if only our dog did a little bit more
damage okay that's a nasty squad
you gotta go
nothing else here matters but
you gotta go okay you can re you know
what look look look
sell me
can me
now we got a different squad we got
something like this
this
did my brain just break or did did is
the art different now
did we do something am i crazy are they
all diagonal
they just don't look right man
broken brain hold on brain reset
they look like
rasterized or something uh something
happened man
it looks like there's like a gravity
well at the top it's sucking the animals
in like they're stretched out a little
bit
i'm not having a stroke i can put both
my arms on top of my head
my speech is not slurring
what's the other one i'm not i'm not
trouble standing
no that's fine
i don't smell burnt toast
actually i don't smell
anything at all
dude i think i gotta
i think they gave me like the wrong
glasses prescription
i think i'm seeing things that are like
things that are too far away
are clear
things that are close are are blurry
nah
i put on my old glasses and i'm like nah
this
i think i was just confused quite
frankly
there we go i'm back i'm back
you just got to stand further or sit
further away here
bro i need the space to summon something
else
the sickness is called being bald
madness
has now come over me
source dude just trust me big pills big
pills
man this would be a great round to not
lose
unfortunately they have a 34-31 dog
does nobody else see how [ __ ] this is
how does this how does this happen
[Laughter]
that's crazy man
how did you do that
okay plays
then plays
there was some cupcake i bet there was
early food meta on that one that's my
take on the subject
i bet there was some early food meta
oh dude with cans out here i'll buy a
mammoth for sure
we'll look to kill that son of a gun
i mean are we really gonna buy a bee i
don't see that happening
give me uh honestly give me a pill or
you're a piece give me a pill or your
piece you peace
sell swan i can't it has meat on it it's
too good
don't kill my swan
level three hold on you're someone in a
level one bus
level one bus i don't i don't sweat it
you get a you get a simple kill here but
then i kill you
we got some we got some serious
nastiness coming up with ram city
but look at that we win these we win
these okay
it has to happen
bro we need a pill
i swear
you're just like a pill instead of
making me better you're making me ill
you gotta go we need the space it's that
simple we need the space buy me
wait wasted wasted chocolate by the way
wasted chocolate okay there you go um
give me one of these
now this is a philosophical difference
i believe
a buff on the camel passes
second hand to the kangaroo i believe in
this
this i'm that's what i'm trying to do i
think i roll i tried to roll you
individually um
freeze me roll me
i like a squad okay i like a squad it's
a little goofy
if it's a little goofy just call me a
hyuk
you're not killing me
you're not killing me
little turkey turkey penguin dude i
think we win this
the rams are not that strong turkey's
like probably the best unit in the game
but
it's not gonna get you there on that
squad
that takes us to five wins
for me a good dream here would be to
freeze uh the tiger pill the turtle in
front of the dog roll tiger behind
kangaroo
and then it's in god's hands you can
definitely do this
and then at some point if we could just
see
honestly to give you one of these if we
could just see a pill
i believe
there were some desperate roles in there
you peace you
please please tell me you lived through
hit one you do live through hit one
dude the double the double mammoth
didn't do enough for me but hey it's the
thought that counts you peace all right
that's a good squad
choose outcome we'll pay out the
doubters on that one what can you say
that's a good squad
again you're rolling like exclusively
into the dream squad over and over
i mean we were on like round 10
that's or round 11. let's run it back
run it back
as far as i'm concerned like if you have
a uh
a golden poop on your head by the way
you're basically like you're part of the
empire like the one that strikes back
like it have some taste i get
basically when you have that all you're
saying
could be the creamy clementines
creamy clementines milky minerals is
pretty good too
it just it just goes to show you you
know that you're you're part of the bad
guys all it says is you play a lot
that don't mean nothing we draw these
i think it's going to be a combined
buy buy
that's a good double freeze man that is
a solid double freeze
something like this
that's good value that is insane value
i love a swan man i got nothing i got no
hate for a swan i think we finally sell
our beaver
good hit it's a good hit
then we buy swan
so that we get the fish level up on it
love it
i have absolutely no qualms about
running
an early blowfish
it's possible we'll run up against a
bemeded unit
not today
snail
turn three
snail what you don't like winning
by the way we lose these
[Laughter]
no that's a good that they worked
it worked but they had an unfair
advantage
they got an early snail
what are you supposed to do
now
honestly like you gotta go
we gotta do better it looks something
like this
this
i'm not a hater
so get sold
hit a good unit
that's a good unit
these are not
life finds away
freeze me
roll me
freeze me
okay
this is not terrible
i oh my god this freaking 10-6 level two
horse
five three dog rams like it just
it never ends man it never ends
it's all that the dog is or i should say
that the horse is not getting any more
hp okay so we win these
nice build last time i saw it i fell off
my dinosaur okay the fish
is going bye-bye i know we literally
just got it the time has come so you can
roll a flamingo and honestly a little
bit ambitious but you can get a flamingo
try to get it to level two level two
then
you can roll one of these
right here
you're gonna get some sweet buffs
and i gotta be i gotta be straight up
with you
it's a little touchy
i do think ox beats peacock i'm just
thinking about the order for right now i
like you getting the extra stats but
that could change in the future
easiest freeze of my life
sure why not
i think the peacock can be really good
as long as you don't uh
as long as you don't have it as a one
five
well actually to be fair the other thing
that's funny or or bad sometimes about a
peacock is like
this looks like a heavy draw
uh
it scales defense
or sorry it scales offense which is like
completely irrelevant
you you really need to get
extra attack
like every turn that you live through
allows your unit to do twice as much
damage so it getting health is so much
more important than getting hp
um i wish we had a dodo that did
something here i wish i
it was a baller
et cetera et cetera
okay
i will
freeze me roll me pill me we're looking
for a pill freeze me this this squad is
in need of a pivot coming soon
i can live with this
you eat a sheep that is a very
interesting looking squad last time i
saw this was um about four seconds ago
okay
now now that our real squad starts to
shine
that's not so bad that's obviously not
good
hold on you peace
we win these
we
we lose these holy crap level three
horse all right
okay double double me though hold on
hold on selmy you gotta roll a deer
instead of a flamingo at this point
as much as i would love to get some
upshot on this
bro you gotta roll a shark
i think you need shark
snails
snail
sell
deer
okay
we got two lives to play with we're in
the [ __ ] right now
you're going up against level two dodos
or like uh
you know turkey dog builds every round
but
i've got i've got faith in this build to
do something you're a piece honestly
whatever we lived
we're living oh we owned you okay good
stuff
okay good splash damage
we probably have to dump our blowfish
and then our ox so i think it's gotta be
like a kill the blowfish in front of the
ox
then
i wish it worked
i wish it worked this is just not the
play freeze me
you
you could garlic your shark
i think another unit is pretty important
right now
i'm just going to be straight up with
you these are the worst shops i've seen
in a long time
it's
truly horrendous
the uh
the three roles we just had are
absolutely god-awful
i'm going to can
and then get a 1-1 buff on my whale
not ideal
very similar i understand we got good
optics on that
optics on this look very similar
they do have a kangaroo their kangaroo
beats my
penguin but my bus beats their bus
also we purge your garlic armor
kill you him me him him me
we win these we win these easily
24-14
not bad
now obviously you gotta go
would it kill ya to just give me
anything that worked with our current
build
i don't i don't i mean
it's not hippo i'm just telling you this
is not a hippo run
if we if we got the right permutations
for it it could be i mean i guess long
term could have hippo potential but
you got like seven hippos yeah but you
don't it's not tetris you don't see him
coming down the pipe you know
if i saw seven hippos coming i'd be like
okay let's pivot the hippo
we're gonna
you kind of need like two good units
why did we melon the ox
we didn't really mel in the ox we we
killed something in front of the ox that
we were gonna sell so as a result we got
free melon armor and also a buff on it
i think we got to keep you going
i believe in this
i would like to get a level two deer
it's a bit of a stretch freeze me just
in case i guess
okay okay okay
okay
now we're talking
you can you can roll a turkey here too
okay but
this is fine this is this is adequate
we can lose this round and not be dead
in order to pivot that counter with
turkey pivot the ox
please tell me this thank god you're a
level one hippo
our splash damage is gonna run buck wild
on this team how is this team in in the
mix right here
chad would be like rip level three whale
dude it's just it's driving me crazy
that people who don't know what they're
talking about are trying to get control
of the steering wheel
a level three whale is nice
but a level one turkey is better right
now
it changes the game completely
okay the cow's gotta go
the ox will have to go but you start
with the turkey
you got to go shark chocolate
now snake might have a spot in this run
i gotta i gotta be real with you i think
you can sell an ox
throw an eight eight snake down there
instead
and then we've still got some pivot in
play for our next turn
there's there's a chance here there's a
legitimate chance here
that hippo's gonna be problematic
but at least we killed the scorpion it's
only a level one hippo
that hippo's gonna be a real problem
please shoot the hippo
i'm begging you
now that was the one time it probably
shouldn't have happened but that's okay
am i insane this looks okay
this looks fine
oh what that
i thought it did does it do 2x
i thought it only did one x
i knew the b was coming but i didn't
think they had enough damage to kill me
i guess it does attack too there yeah
there is that
okay
all right yeah i mean we got a lot of
stuff we want to try here but
we'll do that for now
kind of looking for a fly
beyonce is pretty sick honestly
that level two snake
for the love of god
no it's the it's the meta bill dude
and they're they're such a coward
they're running on the guest build
it's the no no wait wait wait they don't
have a fly they don't have a fly
without a fly anything could happen
give me that bus let's go
eat me you peace
let's go
take that one
guaranteed they're in chat right now
guarantee it
okay i gotta be honest with you i think
both of these are diminishing returns
but i don't care
okay now i care um the whale has to go
in place of a fly
it it screws up our life a little bit
it it ruins our snake
but
i'm gonna do it nonetheless
no splash damage please no splash damage
please
that's he's not splashing good hit good
hit
level one equals we're pogging
decent shot we take those
shot we take those
now this is where things get horrendous
for us
everybody chill everybody chill it's not
over till it's over
more hp please
we draw these
[Laughter]
oh
man
hold on something's going on back here
what's going on back here
nothing nothing
you got to put more sauce on the fly i'm
gonna stop you right there uh brother i
that sentence is inherently meaningless
what are you talking about you gotta put
more sauce on the fly
what does this mean
i would like melon armor please
roll me one time
yummy yummy
the fly it needs extra sauce of course
of course
hey look at that
the steak uh is gonna it's gonna do
something it did something
oh you thought you did something owens
what the heck's going on here that seems
like an incredible hit for us
we're still popping that seems all right
hey guess what that seems all right oops
oops
[Laughter]
nice meta build pepe x
this does not feel like a uh
like a 10 win
i'm having a fun time on our seven
though
melon
armor
you still need some melon as well just
for a double snake trigger
freeze me you know what freeze me
snake is a lot of fun man i i do love a
snake
48 48 at the back here it's a little
spooky
oh son of a
actually might be kind of helpful
nice shot
although their turkey it doesn't seem to
it doesn't seem like it's running into
that much trouble right now uh excuse me
it does not give melon armor there is a
gap there's a gap it should be giving
melon armor to the gap
the gap should be getting melon armor
we exactly we were literally he did 50
we had 30 plus melon armor you're a
piece
you're not a piece that's just good play
congrats you're you're a good gamer
congratulations
we're going
big plays
big plays
big plays good stuff see uh dude shoot
that fly if you shoot that fly
shoot it shoot it
i'm you but snake
the 420 lizard what a name
shoot it shoot a shoot
oh
oh oh oh oh oh yeah that's right i
forgot that's how it works that's fine
that makes sense
it's i'm not upset
snake kind of pog huh
look at that
easy money
you gotta try to get the turkey going of
course why not why not
don't make me
laugh um
yeah
freeze me
the fly like we don't need the scaling
on it that much even though some people
would try to tell you it's a little
sauceless right now
this seems like we have no avenue for
winning
[Laughter]
this team is uh this is just insane um
it's basically
five fifty fifties that's tough even
seth rogen and joseph gordon-levitt only
made one
i love that 5010 beaver man
you know what though hey look at this
we only lost by one unit plus a b at the
end
now that's a big beaver
that was good though
we eventually got a believer payout you
love to see



hey everybody
welcome back it's a little bit more
super auto pets we are on
um we're on pay to win now
let's do pay to win against everybody i
was getting a little frustrated on
stream yesterday um
not in like a serious way but just i
feel like the pay to win
uh
builds i could be wrong this is just
based on like an hour of gameplay i feel
like pay to win
struggles a little bit in the
early mid game versus free to play
now it does pretty well at the very
start because you got the fishit two
three which is in both packs but then
you also have the uh green ladybug also
known as the beetle that's a two-three
that's only in the pay to win build um
so i feel like the early game might be a
little bit better like the first two
rounds might be a little bit better on
pay to win but i feel like once you get
into like horse dog ram blah blah blah
like that's where free to play can can
do some damage to you early if you're
not careful but i do feel like pay to
win
tends to do better long term by the way
if you're wondering about the hat if you
haven't watched the twitch vods which
makes sense because these are coming up
before the twitch vods i think um
this is uh it's a one of one special hat
for my account only thank you to team
wood games it was uh they they offered
and i acquiesced and uh i mean it's it's
beautiful
i love it golden poop is on the way out
you ever see the eggshell you know
what's up give me a cricket i don't love
it but if if it has to be done it has to
be done
i will take um
i will take one mosquito one fish freeze
the mosquito because pears are good
i mean you this is a really good one
this is a unintended sedins is probably
a good one too because i'm sure they
intended for this to say sardines but i
mean this is probably one of the best
names you could possibly ask for big ups
to the new name dlc
two three one two
one two three into the four
pupsy a dubsia 69 is on the floor what
happened to your squad i'm not i'm not
trying to be rude i just i don't know
how that could have possibly come to
pass
this is an okay squad
okay
the the thing that's worth noting is
that one extra shot from a mosquito is
not worth that much
um it's not a huge deal now you got to
make a decision so we know we're going
to do this the decision you would make
is uh what's worth more
two extra hp or a permanent plus one
attack and the question really is do we
think we can win this round regardless
i think the answer is possibly
as a result of that
let's buy the bird normally i don't love
it we'll have the bird buff the mosquito
because the mosquito is most likely to
pair up soon
we would love to see the ant hit the
mosquito this is we're going up against
a nasty squad just being straight up
with you ant mosquito and fish
kind of bad this looks like a loss
this uh it doesn't look like a loss it
is a loss the moist balls what a name
[Laughter]
the good news if you want to call it
that is that i don't think the the
beetle would have saved us there
um
no no no no i mean tabby cat look it's a
4-3 and i think there's something to be
said about maybe buying it
and then
using it to just help you win one round
but long term it's not it's not in our
wheelhouse um i think you say goodbye to
the bird 2-1 versus a 2-3 with a faint
trigger we add a swan to the situation
we're looking for even just a pair
i'm kind of dying
like it doesn't have to be
uh
a triplet but even just a pair i would
consider acceptable so a 3-5 dromedary
exists basically just because
you know we needed some stats to get
through this next round that was a shop
that was cursed we had okay selections
but none of them were related uh to the
units we already had which is like the
worst possible outcome we're gonna lose
this one there's like no doubt about it
there's no way we're making it through
here the clean masseuses i honestly like
you have some control over the gameplay
and then you don't have some control
over the gameplay
in this situation we didn't really have
that much control over the gameplay you
know the shop
sort of sort of did us dirty
okay so you can sell a fish
i think you would love to buy
um
hold on i think you would love to pill
an ant
then you buy a swan
because it's a four five
then
combine
we only have five right we don't combine
yet it's a little weird okay but in
order to make this kind of work
especially for round one we gotta do
something like this
um and this is not bad
like we got some pretty impressive stats
but we also like desperately need to win
um we we can't afford like one more loss
is is pretty much catastrophic and this
is a squad that is we we got a little
lucky on that one
but they're they're very spooky i think
we might come out of this one with a win
look at that that was a pretty evenly
matched team there so we're 2-2
start to think about having like some
potential chances here the drama dairy
uh is doing some good work and making
our units uh like a little bit stronger
i would say like a hatching chick you
can roll with keep in mind you know what
we probably do want to go mosquito level
up that's a that's a gimme
i don't love a skunk
i think you can freeze it for now though
the thing is with the dromedary you lose
the uh i'm freezing these because
they're plus two plus two or maybe the
skunk isn't but the skunk is at least a
tier four what we wanna do is get a pill
pill the flamingo for upside admittedly
it's perspective okay um then we would
take a hatching chick play the hatching
chick it being a 3 3 is not that big of
a deal but a 1411
uh or i guess a 12 12 uh swan 1411
mosquito 1212 swan would be really nice
with garlic armor that's a that's a very
potent unit so we're rolling and we're
looking for
things we didn't get
we can roll one more time
okay we didn't really get what we were
looking for
i think you say no to a skunk as much as
it bothers me to do so
and we buff
like it's we need to get some wins
i think you can freeze one more garlic
because an early garlic on a swan would
help us honestly an early garlic on a
dromedary would also slap and it's the
best thing you could ask for in the shop
so i don't really see a need to feel bad
about freezing the whole shop admittedly
we do want a pill but we're going to buy
both of those garlics so
all right so this is where we're hoping
that this is going to come through in
the clutch garlic is is honestly just
overpowered
in the early game at least we're not
we're trying to get the 10 wins but just
to get ourselves out of you know where
we're at right now at uh and three wins
by round six would be nice so we're
going to swann up for the time being
be straight up with you a round six worm
seems completely playable
i think we're going to say bye bye to
the flamingo
and as as strange as this looks because
it's a 2-2 with garlic um
we want it to have garlic
and we uh
we know that it gets the one one buff
off of it as well
worm caterpillar by the way can work i i
think to some extent is just a question
of how much you want to invest in your
pivot
as long as we get through the kangaroo i
am not sweating this we have built a a
strong mid-game team basically because
garlic is the strongest item uh you can
get early
i think
um
and we got a good economy here okay
so anything that gives us like permanent
stats like an apple for example as minor
as it might seem i think we have a real
obligation to invest quite heavily in
our worm
now for three gold i mean i i guess you
would consider maybe meat on a dromedary
temporarily and right off the bat like
our worm is already at hatching chick
levels oh this is nasty man this is a
loss this is just a very strong team
i don't know how we're gonna do 18
damage to you
we were close we were actually almost in
there come on just give me like just one
more win let's just bet on one more win
right now get this worm popping
look okay you just gotta like that's the
way you're gonna play it a caterpillar
actually fits nice i just don't know if
we can actually make it work because
we're gonna like run out of time
uh but i i think if if we're committed
to trying to get 10 wins then we'll want
a caterpillar out there for the future
okay it i mean it it's got to be done we
still like the garlic we're not sweating
anything else here come on now come on
just give me like a any food with a
permanent bonus
i was hoping we would roll into a pair
but that's okay that takes us to we got
a 17 17 up at the front
and every round is a gift at this point
we got it we're going up against an 11
11 worm
we win these we win these we win these
uh that does enough okay so we're gonna
break even or we're gonna do better than
break even i should say
five wins on a run that looked like it
might not get there for a time uh and i
gotta be honest given the choice between
an eight-eighths one or a nine-six
mosquito both with garlic we're gonna
keep that swan for economy purposes
all of a sudden we got double malk on
our worm we got a 23 23 garlic armor
worm
that's gonna do some serious work
you can pill a turtle or you could just
take a turtle but the turtle i still
think like long term it's incredible um
but in the short term garlic will
outperform melon
source dude just trust me
i would love to get our worm leveled up
a little faster but i think
the caterpillar leveling up faster is
also
insanely important
[Laughter]
i'll be straight up with you too you
could sell a cow and roll a deer instead
we we want to freeze this i think for
now you sell a cow roll a deer up at the
front hope you don't roll up against the
hippo um we got a 25 25 garlic armor
worm we're hoping the chili pepper
disrupts whatever our opponents have
going on here
this seems totally fine right now
obviously the kangaroo is going to get
kind of strong but
no no no
oh we do okay i didn't do the math right
that's six wins
on twitch that would be a believer
payout now um
give me one of these try it
let's go
let's go
there will be no pilling
honestly it's so important we win this
round you you just go one level up you
know what no no no freeze the worm roll
once
we don't need to go one level up on the
worm right now
we'll just give it a cupcake instead i
guess a scorpion technically might be
better than a deer there but let's
freeze you too um
now we got a 32-32 and we'll level up on
a more relevant turn the odd-numbered
turns are a little bit more relevant
okay well this is horrible
it could not be worse this is a loss
um
yeah hippo is going to outscale us
and then they got good units behind
honestly though we did considering how
things fell apart in the early game and
how bad our early shops were i'm
actually pretty pleased with how we got
out of that one and i owe it all to the
worm i'm i'm pretty stoked
beaver's fine pig don't at me even
though pears are valuable don't have me
this is really bad
um
the thing is like i know this is gonna
look like a weird turn like why wouldn't
you take the pair
i'll be the boring bits
i've been guilty of those on stream a
few times um
i
and i could be wrong like this
and we this may prove it here um because
we are going to lose this one for sure
but we they had an ant and a fish we
just had a worse shop set up honestly um
the the truth of the matter as i see it
at least
is that hp is so much more precious
well you could do either really
i just like a green beetle man um
the the truth of the matter is that i
think hp is so much more precious than
attack
that might invert at some points in the
game
especially like if you have garlic on
you for example but um
in general i'm a big believer in you
know one hp early does a lot more for
you than one extra attack
so again we have no uh
levels but we're close
let's roll once
honestly like
i think you gotta roll once
i love a bat that's i'm never gonna be
mad about that
i wish you hadn't buffed the beaver but
you know what temporarily speaking
i think maybe
look that see that's pretty good we
don't really want a four six or a two
two but um
temporarily speaking this is okay but
i'm very disappointed in our inability
to get triplets
all that being said if we'd invested in
the bird you we could have gotten some
triplets but the the flip side of that
is how are we supposed to know that in
advance you know
i guess you're just supposed to buy
everything with the idea that uh maybe
in the future uh it'll show up again but
you know you don't have knowledge of the
future roles
okay now we can start to
think about our future i think on round
four you gotta go caterpillar so
controversial maybe but i think you
would sell your bird first that way your
beaver
is more likely to hit units you respect
you'll roll a caterpillar at the back
you can definitely play like a front
flamingo
and uh you know it gives shop animals
plus two health
i think we can buy and
like buying this and eating this it
gives you a buff it gives you a
temporary buff
i wouldn't feel bad about rolling a one
seven peacock
i mean it's
getting those buffs is kind of hard man
any anything helps in that department
remember by the way weakness has been uh
has been nerfed
this is a loss by the way
so uh weakness is not as strong as it
used to be but bat is still pog
mostly in the late game i think to
override equipment but
um
all right straight up i'm like you gotta
go
i think we try
i mean i'm gonna go crazy here i'm gonna
i'm gonna pill you with the bat
involved
this way when we buy this there's an
insanely good chance it hits you
if it hits you and you then we uh
ragequit
okay that's great stuff now we've got a
one-nine peacock
two bats
and then we'll freeze this so we get
another bat next turn
and roll once
i know we have one hp zero wins but like
this is actually okay
we're going to lose by the way
um
yeah for sure
it's it's already been done uh
well that's winless man dude the
that's rough that's rough i i honestly
chalk a lot of that up to a loss of
momentum
from not getting uh like good
early game pairs like
this time will be the
be an awkward piggy how does that sound
like lord of the flies
we really like at this
front uh
we draw these okay you really need to
like on
turn three you need to get
one more unit like you need to get a
level two unit
otherwise it's uh
you know you hit diminishing returns
real quick
let's let's go in a different direction
for a second
normally i would probably combine
mosquitoes
add another unit maybe a cricket holy
birch
this seems great for us
it's funny like i think the horse build
i think it tends to lose or maybe it's
just double and like ants are a little
spicy to run early
um
it's a tough one to peel a flamingo on
right away
but definitely we don't mind the idea of
of peeling a flamingo next turn and
rolling it for now we're just probably
like economically gonna run into a tight
spot here this is much better
i would say you combine your mosquitoes
by the way swan is great i just don't
know if it's gonna be
functional here
on turn three we want a dog to pop as
fast as possible
so summon me a dog
sell the beaver and i know that this
looks weird
but this allows us to then
summon this which gives us a plus zero
plus one
we could combine and it'll give plus
four
plus one plus one plus one and maybe it
won't give that next i don't know but
either way
we'd rather have a 2 3 out there right
now now that i think about it we'll just
stall for one turn i think we could
totally freeze you and you having two
pills here it seems very nice
we might compromise this round but we at
least have like a cogent and coherent
through line for our future
by which i i essentially just mean
we're we are so lucky
that the bee is gonna kill this peacock
this is a draw but it's a great draw
we actually have like a plan that we can
structure our whole run around which is
incredible so we obviously start with
the combine
which is very nice then we want to make
sure the dog gets the flamingo buff
four gold for two plus ones
or four uh yes two plus one plus ones is
not that bad but we could also do it
differently like we have nine gold right
now
it's an awkward amount i think we can
summon you unfreeze you
we'll be looking to put down
a different creature here hold on
it's just a little weird um
i don't think we want a fish honestly i
think we'd rather have like a spider
technically you want it in front of the
dog which is a little awkward here we
could sell and then buy another animal
but i think a role to look for uh the
stuff we actually want to see is not so
bad and again i i think two pills here
is good
i think you can freeze the flamingo man
i don't think you want a level two
spider but a spider can do some amazing
work for you
um
it has to summon the right stuff
like vanessa with the singing career but
uh
lucky us
it but you know what on this one it
doesn't actually have to summon the
right stuff this guy's name is actually
the huge balls huh you can just get that
that that's a dream i had no idea um
okay so we know we want the dog to get
iced
or sorry the flamingo to get ice to buff
the dog
and then
we'll i we could do it again i think now
we actually have the gold to make this
sensible um we're gonna need to do
something about uh
this mosquito at some point this is a
semi-aggressive roll
the best thing you could do here is
garlic on the dog and i know it's
gonna seem a little strange but
i would rather have garlic on the dog
than summon a random tutu dog just to be
real so i think you freeze freeze roll
once
freeze because this could go wrong and
it's nice to have the capacity this is
the the relatively rare in my opinion
this could be a loss this is the
relatively rare
sensible opportunity uh to roll
a four squad
the thing is one of the reasons we're
rolling a four squad is because of the
fact that we probably overspent on like
those flamingo plays we were doing early
but it's it's actually going to pan out
for us so
just goes to show you
you can't believe everything you read on
our slash super auto pets imo is a
little late for puppy but
i mean to be honest with you maybe it
isn't because maybe a puppy works really
well instead of a 4-5 mosquito that
we're never going to invest in the level
up on
we didn't really even need to sell there
now that i think about it
um and there's our mosquito but we
probably wouldn't have gone may i don't
know maybe we would have we can we can
freeze this on you you're you're a great
sellable
it's one of those things where like a
turtle
does really i i honestly for now as good
well you know okay i think this is what
you do you freeze the turtle you freeze
the pill you roll a beaver at the back
and then you realize that you screwed up
with the puppy you shouldn't have the
puppy at 1-1 getting no buffs you know
so economically i've already made a
mistake
next turn though we will sell the beaver
get a buff
we will put the turtle in front of the
fish and pill it
which will do a good job of creating
melon armor on our fish and melon armor
does better for us we're lucky man we're
lucky
we draw these
melon armor does better than a b even
though the b has had some very
fortuitous moments i i gotta level with
you the poodle is the play
so we know the beaver's going so get out
of here
the worst buffs you could've asked for
um
this is still good
three two two one
we like this squad
it might be a little slow
and to be honest with you
i think now
for scaling porpoises we actually sell a
puppy although it gets plus two plus two
every turn
like i think a buffalo could work
but i also i don't know even though the
puppy's a little slow
i think it can get there
we're not going to keep a spider that's
like it's not long for this world we can
roll one more time we definitely love a
second poodle though
i don't know a fish at this point i'm
like i think that you're overpaying for
one one
anyway this is going okay for now i i'm
a little pessimistic about our
our future but we'll see
could be wrong
this looks like another draw and and we
had a good squad so we're like we're
starting to run up against it here we've
only got three wins we can't afford to
like fall off here
uh so puppy's getting buff at level
three right now we could roll the sheep
and the sheep is good but we're really
looking for a level two
no we're looking for a level
five really to replace our spider which
means we got a little time
hatching chick is a level three what's
getting buffed at three puppy okay so
i'll just level with you
we we don't love a spider here
instead you get uh an early like well
actually a pretty late hatching chick
but still
a 1917 garlic armor dog buff buff buff
no buff buff this is this is good this
is good
level two poodle next turn is gonna amp
up this scaling i don't think we got a
10 win coming but i think we we
definitely have like a potential
seven
and i could be wrong like i mean we we
scaled or we match up super nicely right
here
some of these units like i the fish with
raw stats is going to be great but we we
kind of need more scaling to get it
there but
like it needs to level faster i think
you could dump a hatching chick
even though the plus five plus five is
nice the we get a permanent benefit out
of the you know the buy
um
and i think we we
should at this point start spreading
some of the scaling around
we don't have a level three friend
but we should
honestly okay hold on we want to keep
two gold so we can roll once
and then we could like sell cow
we could buy food as well but we could
sell cow
and buy deer and i think that gives us a
good chance to
keep going here um and just keep in mind
that the uh
we're keeping some gold floating at the
end of every turn
because of the fact that uh this is a
nasty team man um because of the fact
that we get uh
plus two plus two on the puppy for that
so we we came out with it again look at
that that takes us to five
you're probably gonna go we're gonna
spread out a little some of these buffs
honestly the puppy's gonna get there i
think maybe we'll apply this one to the
dog
um you're probably gonna go
we do want like a permanent scaler but
right now i like having a flex position
and there's a part of me that's like you
know
i think we actually we're gonna stick
with this
yeah yeah freeze me for a second there's
a part of me that actually really likes
having one open spot because if we
decide later like things are falling off
we can switch oh this is horrible this
is just horrendous man this look at this
squad
it's the strongest squad that's ever
existed
although they get pretty weak once we
get through this
peacock okay puppy
it's all up to you man he's not gonna do
it but he was actually kind of close
like two seven seven monkeys is not that
scary
uh outside of the very very early game
so you're probably gonna go
garlic is still really good i'm i'm
really thinking we don't go turtle yet
i'm also thinking that we don't go bad
because we're already buffing at level
two we're buffing our dog so you know
what keep the bed for now it's like an
okay
okay selmy
now we're getting much faster buffs
you have to take a t-rex it's literally
just a better poodle
but you keep your level two poodle and
you roll a t-rex and now like this squad
this is pretty much the kind of squad
where i think we can just hit end turn
every time and then the chips are gonna
fall where they may
we did our job which was in this case
survive until uh
you know round two
or uh round what am i talking about
survive until t-rex i should say they
got another very i mean that's a scaling
squad with with some solid penguin
action you can't be mad
hit me with one of those
there's something to be said about a
scorpion man but
okay we need some melon armor but the
the scaling was pretty nice there i
think we're running into some some dirty
teams you gotta embrace that and we are
we're somewhat late in the game so this
is not unexpected we're lucky we trade
we do better than trade we do way better
than trade okay
spooky harambe what a name
[Laughter]
um
look i mean
there's a part of me that's like why
would i pay for the one one we're not
gonna summon any other units like we're
better off maybe
it and it's a it's a big fish but
i think we're better off trying to fish
for a uh
like a level two poodle or a level two
t-rex
we're hitting peak scaling pretty soon
we need to live long enough to make that
happen and we're rolling into some
seriously like nightmarish teams but
three melon armor
pretty nasty
we win these though would you look at
that hey hey you noted chatter prussia's
the suave craters
hope you enjoyed seeing the egg hat
today i guess that's not how it works
but we we can't fit anything like the
the opportunity cost on selling one of
these units is so high right now
we just we just can't fit it if anything
we're really looking for
i mean it i think you freeze this
because either a poodle or a t-rex is a
is a huge
hit and we hit the t-rex
we have hp to play with so we're going
to give the chocolate to the t-rex next
turn
um
we might as well take advantage of our
current scaling
and we really need melon melon on the
dog turns this into a potential 10 run
thank god we at least live there
oh we we crushed this we crushed this we
crushed this we crushed this we're in
there him him me him me eight wins uh
going up against increasingly horrible
squads
just believe in the plan man we don't
need that next level dog it doesn't do
anything we gotta freeze you
we're looking for chocolate or poodle we
don't see it that's okay
or melon melon would also because we
could use melon on our puppy as well
quite frankly
who would have thought this damage like
would be relevant like not quite being
at 50 was enough to really screw us up
here
on the bright side on the bright side on
the bright side we win these
that takes us to nine wins and there's a
chance
so you're saying there's a chance melon
poodle
rolly
you might be saying we're getting close
to the point of which i see this in chat
all the time we're getting close to the
point at which a t-rex is no longer
relevant oh you don't think a 25-20 is
relevant you'd rather replace it with
like uh
nothing i don't think so
we win these that's 10 wins would you
look at that
never doubt the power of scaling even
late thanks for watching i gotta get out
here so i can start my stream hope you
enjoyed it i'll see you next time see ya
see ya



we're back we're playing some super auto
pets we are on uh pay to win we're on
pay to win let's get it started you know
what i totally forgot you gotta run
predictions
you pop it out
you go um
start prediction will now get six wins
or more it's just that simple
we're playing against all decks as we
speak because i'm not a coward
yeah
okay start it up
um good enough
good enough
i can live with that it's a nice pair
eggshell head by the way egg hat is
ready to go
desperate dog is pretty good what the
heck is pronk
shy sailors is good don't care didn't
ask but it's spelled wrong what the heck
is pronk man okay like desperate doggies
is good but i feel like we gotta go like
for the world's worst name we'll be the
the rude pronx
we draw these we win these
game name is still wrong hold on is this
true is such a thing true
it is you're absolutely right game name
and title still wrong saved super auto
pets
tgif super auto pets have you ever 10
won a sloth build i'll level with you i
still haven't seen a sloth like don't
you need
um
don't you need to like get a b to level
three to see a sloth or something like
that
by the way this is a an incredible start
here this is a great shop
green ladybug
shoot the horse let's go okay we only
took out one horse which means we're
still gonna have a nasty time against
these crickets but once we get through
them they're done man they're done like
look at this
very good start early on
not a very good start here
i think we can afford to buy an ant so i
would say for now give me one
juicy one
i forgot we had to level up already i
don't know what's wrong with me you can
totally put an owl on the squad
5-3 owl that's no sweat then i think you
can go rolls
things have changed i think you can
combine mosquitoes and i don't love a
dromedary but i think you can roll a
dromedary for one turn
and then just cupcake the crap out of
your fish very little is gonna chunk
through
a seven eight fish in game three
if the if something could do it
four five level two cricket with a ram
behind it like there's some there's some
gas there but i'm feeling okay
we win these there's three wins already
we have no theme but there's three wins
okay okay obviously you're going to be
selling the owl
um
we can we can roll a 4-5 swan so i would
say you probably
uh dump
your beetle first
then you buy a swan then you hope the
owl hits the fish or the swan
well still he's stuck around for a
little bit he'll still stick around for
a little bit roll me
we'll we'll get a a infamous second swan
roll me
we'll combine swans
actually you know what we'll freeze bad
it'll get it'll be a 2 3 if we buy it
next turn roll one more time no freezes
cupcake my fish again
should it should have the force four
five swan up at the front but that's
okay
as long as we trade with the kangaroo
oh
no
we lose these just barely though just
barely
mosquito difference
yummy yummy good good yums um we can do
a quick combine five six not so bad bat
is a given we got nine gold
you can roll a puppy early so sell this
dromedary
get a puppy out there
freeze me a puppy now you know what buy
me a puppy
let's move you up in the power rankings
end turn with surplus gold so we get a
buff
please mosquito mosquito
mosquito hit that no don't hit the swan
you stink yeah yeah that's probably more
relevant
beautiful play
oh this is a nasty uh we lose these we
lose these great scaling
nice dodo
left with two gold look i know you're
memeing but it's because of the puppy
puppy scales off of it okay um honestly
straight up like
fish you gotta go we can keep the
mosquito for moments for for temporary
moments garlic is actually goaded
we don't need a turtle yet like it's not
bad like you could you could definitely
get away with rolling a turtle here to
protect the mosquito but garlic i
genuinely think is a little better okay
i mean this is like straight up man i'm
like chili's she's like
so what you gotta do
you sell that even though it's a six six
now we got an 11 12 garlic armor we roll
once freeze and freeze
and we roll one more time and we freeze
and then we stay on two
now we got a 1011 swan with garlic armor
this might not go well but the next
round is looking juicy
don't care
we still trade
we still lose this one for sure that's a
nasty swan
we still draw this one for sure we still
draw this one for sure
and the scaling has begun
hold on you gotta you gotta use your
brain on this one
four
now that'll put us on seven
rather than doing that freeze me a pill
freeze me an eagle
buy me a puppy buy me another puppy this
is gonna be a 13-13 puppy i would still
rather have garlic on you i like the way
this is outlined right here
if we want to peel a turtle or an eagle
we can do so next turn i'm feeling like
our timing is pretty good don't screw me
not screwed confirmed not screwed
extremely good luck
that's a big hit
bad difference baby
four now
you get ko'd we can spawn an eagle i
don't sweat that
we roll once
we're going to buy one thing the thing
we are going to buy is a cupcake
for our garlic swan
we're gonna scale that puppy
i have no idea what's going on here just
watch the emojis crash into each other
okay
that's the most important thing
that's pretty bad but the weakness
carries regardless oops
didn't even see the puppy
strange squad
because we're gonna be replacing some
things in the future why you do me a
favor can me
round nine you're gonna swan me
dude it's honestly don't shoot the
messenger
this is how i game
13 13 gorilla up at the front we just
need to win one round
doesn't matter doesn't matter
owned
little turkey action's not great i'll
admit it's not great
you peace
please please
let's go we draw these
[Laughter]
okay okay okay
you're already scaling
there's a real temptation there's a real
temptation to roll uh
to roll a scorpion instead of like a
hatching chick
i think you could try it
with the knowledge that we're like six
wins is is the chief
outcome for us that's still really good
too
okay our gorilla is is dead for certain
didn't break my melon armor though not
gonna kill me though
we win these believers
believers get paid out
okay
now we got to think about how the squad
goes from here we've we've done the
believers we did what had to be done
a swan despite the gold is not long for
this world on on turn 11 a swan must go
i will buy the eagle because we get some
nice stats out of it to begin with i
will freeze the turtle and roll we're
looking for something run defining and
we just found it
we will sell
i'm just going to be straight up with
you i think a scorpion is going to beat
an eagle in this situation so do me a
favor sell an eagle
buy a pig
sell a pig
i don't want garlic on you i don't feel
like it's that relevant
the turtle may still be relevant
even though it doesn't trigger i gotta
think we want wanna be on two gold so we
can spend five
don't really need a can
but
there is
hold on hold on
there was probably a tier one in there i
should okay let me think for a second
buy takes us to two
i think i think you accept you've got
two hp
and you just do this
and we don't sell until next turn we
roll something like this
keep that turtle around
we need to stay at well we don't need to
stay too cold we're gonna stay at two
gold coconut armor
extraordinarily clutch coconut armor
melon armor pretty nasty not gonna lie
to you
we lose these for certain okay let's
scale it again
no can required and say sell me
buy me
sell me
buy me
i don't i'm starting to think we don't
need a turtle
i'm starting to think we need a turtle
roll me tier ones please no tier one
imports
chocolate puppy a little tempting but
the the optics aren't gonna quite work
out roll me once
no tier ones life goes on
use the unfrozen one just in case we got
the chance to get to a level two later
give me a try
the squad is is not quite there honestly
our scaling is kind of bad
but we might get lucky some sometimes
you just get the right kind of like it
just shakes out properly
that doesn't trigger the oh it's still
oh cause we still got hurt
we lose these but just barely it's gonna
be a dragon versus a shark and we're
just just barely gonna lose it
still though
will we get to six wins or more
confirmed there's six wins
pay out the believers
and then run it back that was that was a
good round we we went through some
toughness we had a strong early game we
went through some toughness
and then we uh we brought it back at the
end with some scaling
can't be mad two three two three roll me
controversially i'm i'm a believer in
the beaver
call me the believing beavers
overt is new let's be overt scouts
uh spooky forest
we absolutely lose these that's a 5 000
point flex
and it's not even a hat
that's incredible
can't be mad man can't be mad
slightly controversial perhaps
i mean i don't know what you want me to
say like we're uh
we're playing like we got good shops and
we're playing the shops that we got like
i'm not i'm not sweating it too much
right here
you got to play the cards you're dealt
we draw these i'll settle for that
these are these are solid you know early
game mechanics
we absolutely love a swan let me get a
combine let me get a swan
let me get a cell
you live with it
let me get a roll
now here's where things get interesting
let me get a freeze
and a roll
you gotta you gotta play a batman you
gotta play a bet
so
are we are we also gonna play a peacock
what a great question
um i would say
that we're going to give meat to our
green ladybug which will also make you a
2-5 and it'll turn our bat into a 1-3
the once in future king has returned
let's roll you at the front
and try to see if we get a little lucky
here
it's the 3-5 at the back that's or the
6'5 at the back yeah there's just no
chance
um okay so we're two losses already here
finally we get a level okay that's
sell a one four
put an owl into the squad you could do
worse than an owl
roll me
that's tough
that is a tough one
i want to use you for one round
this is tough
this is a very tough one
there's some puzzling to be done
honestly if we're gonna buy you like we
might as well try at least giving you a
a nice feed
this looks pretty bad though
the squat is not necessarily that spooky
it's a level one horse
we win these
this is a squad where like everything
synergizes um
for them but it still sucks
horse horse is kind of stinky
so i'm like this is a this is a cell
that's great actually even though it's
our worst unit they're going to be
sticking around
i think we're going to
like buy
i know how this looks
but like
the bye bye
then creates a 2 8 dog
and if we can get a
2 like 2 8 is not that impressive but it
helps our scaling a little bit
all we really need is some garlic
okay three eight that's gotta be better
still kind of scary on unturned five one
win two losses
i i've never really rolled a food build
before your your safety is not
guaranteed
we're gonna lose our cricket here which
is is nasty it's it's okay this is a
guaranteed loss
okay
belivium
have anyone else believe him or just me
right now so it's a combine
it's a buy
please
that's what we need it's a combine
you can absolutely
buy a sheep and run it in the squad
if you have to you can sell a swan i
mean technically if you wanted to you
could sell a swan go to six
pill the sheep go to five get two spawn
triggers
sell both sheep
go to seven
roll and purchase whatever the two other
animals are
i don't think the believers would want
you to do this
but you could you do the first part for
sure
and then you roll
and then you invest in bat difference
and you just freeze it there and you
no swan you roll
i think that's a great fill for next
time
well those are not relevant um
it would be nice if they were but okay
then don't combine but move please
freeze two snails if we lose we die
if we draw we can't use them
camel that's we we needed to hit camel
that much was a given
this this could not have gone any better
for us right off the start this will be
a win for sure
they're for next game
[Laughter]
okay
combine
that's a really early
creature here i'll be straight up with
you like the sheep is amazing but this
play is just hilarious
and then put a an eagle in here that
will look to pill in the future anyway
like something like this right now
i think you pill an eagle man
holy bursh um
freeze me okay now let me think two six
one three two
i don't
you could sell a hatching chick for a
poodle next turn and try to get double
scaling rolling on everything you'll
sell your beetle as well
there's a chance there's a chance
we need garlic on the dog too
this doesn't seem that bad like this
seems pretty great
no turtle hey there's a bad squad i you
spawning extra stuff actually and then
buffing it with the horse is gonna be a
little a little nasty but oh my t-rex is
gonna get killed by a damn uh bus
oh and then my bat is gonna dawg no
that is like the best
two loss or two win build you could ever
imagine we were about to go off to the
frickin races
that's a heartbreaker pay out the
doubters on that that's fine you pay out
the doubters
just when you're about to pop
we ran into some like nightmare early
squads like it it definitely just
happens
be the overt organisms here
get that golden poop i would never
downgrade my run
uh from golden poop to non-golden poop
we draw these
we buy these we roll these we buy these
the beaver is built to be sold um
i can't help but feel like you would but
we do need to level them next turn
i guess to be honest
i'd rather have a 3-3 guarantee the
level up with a plus one beaver to also
sell at the end of it
it's all about turn three it's it's the
most important turn in gaming right now
wow we lose these great incredible ant
difference
start
it's really good
um
i would much rather yeah okay um and i
don't know if we're gonna have enough to
fill our whole squad here
we need to get to yeah okay we'll do it
we just have to not be picky
so we'll start with the combine
then we gotta sell
no we gotta buy something else first and
the ram is a great choice
then we'll sell
our crappy beaver if it hits the other
beaver that's fine it didn't you stink
then
will sell here
these are some nasty creatures
now we need we have one re-roll
i'm not in the business of being too
picky here
i think we would take
i think we would take a beetle
freeze a fish roll one time
and then take two fish okay
this is a is a weird squad
but that doesn't mean it's bad he ain't
heavy man he's my brother two five sheep
is insanely annoying
i'm a simple man i see a giraffe i feel
good
this feels absolutely fine we win these
fish please green beetle
i don't mind a trying to get to one
extra level of green beetle
these creatures don't interest me
this creature interests me and i'm gonna
do it this turn you can be mad if you
want i'm gonna do it this turn freeze me
a snail
rather than roll me honestly like
might as well just pop a bee on you
or or get a cupcake
no sweat good
no sweat
we win these
i don't like when my
unit that has the lowest um hp gets
buffed but we still make it through this
it's hard to make it through man like
when you got so much hp on our front
line units it's hard to make it through
so i totally think for the record
that you can roll
um
two rams
it loses hard the garlic but i think
it's okay for the time being
a little late for a scampi imo
probably a little late for a puppy
but i'm gonna do it anyway
i think we might as well combine
give me a three six
freeze me
buy a puppy
roll once
i i don't mind this i don't mind this
i might go crazy i might like freeze a
rabbit man i might freeze a rabbit
that's like i'm loco
this puppy needs way more scaling that's
the only way i can see it happening is
like if okay by the way hippo bodies us
potentially
yeah it lined up like really badly for
me
[Laughter]
the hippo it's just like the the
absolute like worst order that could
have taken place in
hmm two lives to play around with well
there's some gimmies um
like i think
at some point probably now we're gonna
want
this
and i think we're gonna want to sell one
of these too
at present we don't know which yet
but i think
we probably sell our beetle
get the dog buffed caterpillar like has
nothing to scale off of yet i'm gonna
i'm not even gonna freeze that we're not
rolling it long term definitely i'll
freeze this
and
hold on
doesn't get us there we'll freeze it
just in case
and freeze this just in case okay the
whole damn shop's frozen
what we want to see is
the ant buffs the puppy with the garlic
armor and then we just crap on them
then we joke so far so good
i'm ready for the great crapping
this is good this is this is a win
which means we don't need to freeze our
snail
we're on turn seven
level two sheep kind of sick eagle dude
you can be mad i'm not sold on this
eagle okay but i definitely do not mind
buying a puppy and having a bat at the
back to help us out and then we'll look
to maybe pill an ant next turn
pill eagle we did that last time i'm not
saying it can't work
all i'm saying is we did that last time
we got a t-rex and then we lost the next
game
riddle me this
right now we're owning
you got a t-rex when we lost
i'm not saying it's terrible i just i i
think you need more investment than we
have right now so the ant is okay
but we it's the next on the chopping
block for the time being but i think we
save the pill and just roll heavy
looking for like units that'll level up
here
we don't buy an ants
this is a slap in the face
i'll buy another sheep i don't care
we don't need the turtle yet probably in
two rounds but i don't know if we can
afford to mess around with that give me
one of these roll once
freeze me
not an incredible round we'll just hope
for some bad difference yet again
t-rex literally best unit la mao
well if the eagle's flavor text was uh
when you
uh kill something when when this faints
get a t-rex i would probably be a little
bit more open to introducing it to the
strategy
but as it says get a random uh tier six
unit i'm not quite as confident
this is a guaranteed loss this is a
nasty squad mr matcha man
super matcha man okay we need two wins
you pill and ants
it's okay
we get a snail
we get a bed for now we roll like this
we can afford three more
i think that means you got to do this
and i'm not too optimistic about
our possible outcome here but it's only
turn nine we shouldn't be rolling into
truly truly hellish stuff yet i do see
that 1919 uh mosquito that 2020 mosquito
back there's got me feeling a certain
sort of way
but
we'd win these actually
yeah okay and we didn't even need bad
difference
a little lucky but we take those
don't need a deer
this is the believer's win we gotta
think it through this is garbage um
this is fine you can definitely roll a
cow
get some nice buffs and then you know
honestly i think you probably
get your dream here
you don't get your dream here
because instead we will roll a scorpion
up at the front
25 24 maybe if she's 5'3
acceptable acceptable
what do you got there flamingo we don't
sweat that at all
hey sorry doubters
you had extra gold hold on hold on
where is it you had extra gold
chat audit incoming
messages in chat
account created december 2012 which
means you are over the age of nine years
old
two messages lifetime in chat hello you
had extra gold one minute apart from two
minutes ago first off welcome to the
stream
nice to have you here
unfortunately i feel compelled to let
you know
the puppy has a little bit of rules text
associated with it
and the rules text says if you have two
or more gold gain plus two plus two at
the end of your turn as a result i tend
to try to leave two hanging gold much
like floridian ballots in 2000 had some
hanging chads that way we get some
scaling on our puppy
no harm no foul no harm no foul okay
we roll
straight up man i'm like
you can stake
a hatching chick you never know this
could kill an eagle it's or kill a hippo
at some point okay um
i believe you have my stapler um we're
gonna uh just being real with you the
sheep
is less relevant than any unit that we
have available right here whether or not
this works this is how it's gotta go
melon is gonna be very relevant honestly
i feel like a pair might be as well
it's like a little late for for scaling
at all so i don't know what the heck
we're gonna do about that but oh that's
a huge bad difference
oh man okay that takes us to seven
little lucky dude we can we can poppy up
here absolutely
hmm
i don't know man it's tough because like
the melon
is better than the garlic i think you
probably i think you probably do that
first
it's a judgment call
we don't even need a melon on anybody
else but i guess i'll freeze it
i don't see us getting a level three
puppy before the end of the game i think
i think we're in full food territory i
spent too much gold i was just just went
for puppy gold
son of a
okay hold on do do we kill the whale
no i forgot the bus exists
i was like as soon as the deer left i
was like pog this whale's dead you're
over
okay our steak has been killed
this seems bad
either way
dude i don't know we actually might have
made it through there
with the t-rex but we pay out the
believers nonetheless
that's a good one start prediction we're
going to run it back believers get paid
again i think they're up 2-1 right now
let's customize put me on the free to
play
straight up is a little freaky but this
is a squad i don't mind running
3-3 mosquito i you know i got shooters
okay
i mean you already know how our next
turn looks
be the witty masseuses
that's why you don't you don't want a
witty masseuse you know you don't want
to be talked to
please
please
please
we win these
there's one
win having four would have been funny
but i think this is our best
our best option dude straight up you can
actually
you freeze an otter as a just in case
like if we get a second otter in our
shop we'd like to see it i guess but
oh dude hit the shrimp
no shrimp hits
good trades though
we win these for certain
sell mosquitoes for duck honestly duck
is like it's not good
i think this is an early dog build on
the other hand so we get a 5-5 mosquito
creates a rabbit
we buy a dog
combine me we might have to take it a
little slower here i think this is going
to look we got to do the summon even
though it risks buffing the otter itself
i think you go like this
thank you so much i really appreciate
that i think you're also going to do
this you're going to freeze me and roll
me
of these beavers kind of okay as well
honestly i think we're going to go
rabbit
knowing
that we want our duck or our dog i
should say to eat garlic soon which will
then raise its uh its health by one as
well
level two mosquito
i was like ah it's okay it's not so bad
i don't know if we win these this looks
like uh
this looks like a draw to me but i'll
take it considering the size of the
freaking fish man
buy three ducks sell three ducks buy
buffed unit
okay so you've just used uh
all of your gold and three capacity to
buy one unit that is now a little better
what next
i'm just asking what next
okay otter for now you gotta go
three six
give me one of these the fish is is not
long for this world in all likelihood
you know what a 2-3 we sleep on that
why don't you go ahead and toss me a 3-7
instead
and then i'll just be straight up with
you man for the time being
give me a b and toss me one extra hp as
a result
which now the crab should probably be
behind
the dog but and by probably i mean
definitely but
um we might get a level
lockheed we trade now we might get a
level um three mosquito which would be
nice just for the
just to get to that level of shop early
on here
okay
we have to make space that's just the
unfortunate reality of our lives right
now
and i really like the way this crab is
going
the uh
okay here's the thing try this double
wrap double rabbit salad dog
holy holy
okay now crab behind dog we could
combine an ad for sure but let's freeze
the sheep first enroll
well i think you
combine
and i think you buy a sheep
i think you keep the other one frozen
because that's gonna be kind of sick
i'm gonna be dude i mean it's really
hard to say no to a 313 crab right now
as much as we could get a second unit
out there right away
no no no we keep that for now and invest
in some rolling a salad is just fun
though it's not always going to work
that's going to be a level two the crab
doesn't scale really that's going to be
a level
two ram on turn six that's very solid
stuff
oh meet the crab
meet the parents
golden poop
delightful delightful golden poop indeed
all right you're gonna get us on this
one but then we're gonna get you
try to get me i'd rather get you nice
golden poop get killed
right yeah yeah you're not wrong sheep
in front of dog is a better play
um something's got to go you start salad
you piece okay now the rabbit
sorry to tell you
it has to be done in order to fit
now this is actually like pog because
we'll get so many triggers out of this
that your head will explode
yes and then we'll get a combination on
turn seven when it's more emeritus
why not
why not
now the idea of a dodo crab is good but
i think that the dodo is going to get
toasted
i don't think the dodo is going to last
long enough
double salad yeah but we don't have we
don't have the uh
the the the bunny anymore oh tough luck
okay honestly like this guy's pretty
strong
our dog is gonna be incredible though
i mean you're you're
i was gonna say that your uh peacock is
gonna be incredible but i think it's
gonna lose its melon armor and then like
possibly just die
to nothing okay very well played
just kidding
that was rude i apologize
start me here though oh
what the heck okay yeah yeah um
i mean that's just insane
just to be honest with you i think you
don't even make your level three
mosquito
oh no no because we need to figure out i
would rather roll two sets of rams with
a turkey but we need to keep space so
that the rams are not being spawned at
the front which means we need to sell a
crab
then move our dog back
i guess maybe we could have put turkey
in front but we want the turkey to hit
the fly as well then we roll like this
we might combine
i mean if we're gonna keep you around i
suppose we might as well then um i mean
it's very good
you definitely are going to want garlic
armor on dog
this is really good so far i don't think
you need any of those
don't mind it
now this is where the turkey's coming to
shine
you know i'm on fast forward already you
could like take your time or whatever
do we get you we do get you
which means we get you
and then we get a 4 4b at the end not
bad that was a nasty team
we've already got the believers paid out
great stuff um so again the mosquito is
not along for this world we need space
to scale the dog honestly so i think you
buy garlic
sell mosquito
buy cow
we needed to do it in that order so we
didn't lose the garlic we're still early
on too that's what's so nice about this
i mean it's kind of
it's kind of meager but
you know what i think you're right i
think being the back ram
for now is is a lot of fun
you want a turtle
providing melon armor to anything is is
going to be great here an ox would fit
but i don't you you when you get these
spawning bills you really run into um
a capacity problem and i don't think a
ram is good enough now this is where
like our turkey needs to kind of
hit a little faster because this is a
nasty squad here but
we're not gonna getcha we're gonna
getcha there we go
that that hippo is bad but we we still
get over it here
i mean if we make it through the ox with
our dog we win
that's a nasty team man
but we do make it through
look at that
the huge balls what a name
that seven wins
the huge balls
um
for now
this is the way i play
i like that i'm happy with your garlic
for now
we can roll an ants but we have to
we have to think i think you would
freeze
roll we were hoping to see maybe like a
pill
honestly like on this squad
admittedly the monkey gives a nice buff
but we're not really you're not gonna be
at the front
like for
at all
um
i don't want to move the dog to position
one because it gets a nice buff on every
unit that dies admittedly here's the
thing you put the crab here you're like
oh that's sick
um
i think
if you put the turkey at the front you
could put the crab at the back but
that's
very silly i think it's just a weird
squad like let's run it through okay
forget ant for now
monkey at the back your monkey anywhere
pushes
the sheep to the front
which gives it a buff but also gives it
a debuff because it loses one of its
spawns or you get the monkey to buff
itself but i don't i don't really like
that um
you could put a horse and i think a
horse would be okay
actually now that i think about it i
think a 1-1 horse is probably the best
play for right now
anything that moves the dog to the front
misses like i don't know six stat up
triggers that are really good
straight up man i i think you get a
i think you get a horse oh but then you
gotta it still has the same problem
never mind then
this might be
i was going to say it might be equipment
but so you're going to plus three plus
three so you're actually going to be you
would be like an eight eight at the
front but with no future
look
you give us a trigger as well i you i
came around on that one
it's weird but but i came around on that
i'm telling you dog at the front is is
insane
that's pure
insanity this looks fantastic
he gives himself a future i don't know
about that
you had the dog in the front for a
couple of rounds yeah because we didn't
have spawning things or the one time i
forgot but but apart from that when we
have things that spawn in the game we
need the dog to be behind the things
that spawn things
it's just that simple okay now the
monkey i mean he's eight eight but
that's not good enough to carry
instead we kick him out get out of here
you stink we'll spawn you
we'll kill you
it's okay
so i
a whale is very funny
but we don't want it to cannibalize
melon armor i don't really care if it
cannibalizes one sheep
which would actually and a sheep and a
bee
and then it would spit out that sheep
afterwards like i think it's okay
it's it's weird but i think it's okay
i'm gonna give it a try at the very
least
and then i think we should
spend
uh
chocolate
and i think our best chocolate will
actually be on the turkey i'm only doing
that for gold based purposes
okay this is the not the squad you want
to run into
level two uh oh my god tiger turkey
rip on this one
again this should just be resigned
[Laughter]
he is me but stronger that that hippo's
pretty pog
hey but on the bright side we killed it
okay well this is big
i'm not saying this didn't work but
imagine if you had a dog at the front
hey imagine if you just knew what your
opponent's build looked like so you
could just make what statistically is
like the right decision every single
time
imagine
who are you john lennon
you can for a bit
you can roll a snake and you can really
roll it ah but the problem is again it's
pushing things to the front which makes
me think that maybe it's time to get
some combinations going here
and this is the first time it's ever
happened i think for me if we combine
two equipments how do we know which one
stays
i want to keep melon of course
the one at the bottom stays so five five
on eight eight
stays
yes okay sure
yeah thank you that's a big help
now i'm like dude if we put this snake
behind you
we get it it's a gamble right we get
one on your first attack assuming you
don't get killed with melon then you die
we get another one then you summon two
rams we don't get one we get one so we
get three guaranteed it's really a
question of whether you think your dog
is gonna get more than three attacks
and it's a tough question right now i
think i would take the three guaranteed
for now
just for now though
this is just i'll think about this later
and i'll think about this later if we
get a pill um we'll probably think about
that
as soon as our next round is over i'll
keep everything else frozen though the
fly changes the game
okay double melon armor this is where
you want to see something good out of
this
purging some melon armor itself would be
would be quite nice well we don't need
the purging email and armor the badger
will purge it for us
smack that rooster that's that's fine
that's fine man level two
level two is not good
but i think we draw
what an interesting draw
okay well you know you need a fly like
it's not even a contest
and the fly goes
at the back which pushes everything
forward
sadly means on this squad there is no
room for a snake
this is a very weird one
you can you
selling the dog
it probably happens at some point here's
what i think you do for now okay i think
you sell
a snake it's got to go even though i
think the scorpion is
um we're on turn 12. it's not that late
to be honest
i think you
turtle and pill
just for the time being
we know we're going to put a fly on the
squad
this squad is is cracked right now
friend faints gain 2-1
1
two three four
the problem is it if we take a shark
right now like it pushes our
other creatures around a little bit you
gotta choose one or the other so i think
i'm gonna roll dog for one more and then
we'll look at shark and consider
i mean you gotta i mean
look i'm not even gonna think about this
because it's just memory
send it immediately
we're over spawning don't get me wrong
but i think it's still
is adequate imo or no does it not they
didn't spawn a second sheep did it
hold on this is great stuff though
yeah the one up we got to move it back
one further to get it to pop i think
we win these
so it needs to be one further back
[Laughter]
i don't think that is happening because
although i guess we could roll the dog
one in front of it
it'll summon two rams in itself
we don't get the dog bonuses but we get
way more flies dude you got it you got
to give it a shot
but this means that the dog works better
than the shark for now because the shark
won't have like it's cannibalizing so i
think for now like as strange as this
looks keep in mind we are on nine wins
as strange as this looks i'm like this
is a full-on like buff build right now
and if it goes wrong then we can move
the shark into the into the system
you gotta love that they didn't have
melon like the the thing that's crazy
about this one right now is that we're
so early
like i know it looks like we're kind of
in the late game because we got nine
wins but we we won fast
we had a very few draws and like a lot
of wins
if we kill that shark it's over
we don't quite kill the shark but this
is gonna hurt you pretty badly
your turkey's already dead i mean this
has got to be a it's got to be a 10-win
look at this
yeah dude winning early is just the play
turns out not quite perfect
one up still didn't work oh man
[Laughter]
great job though that's 10 wins we can
run one more back i've got eight minutes
freeze me
this is such a lucky role because
whatever we got we had to play
we don't sweat these okay
dude silly beaver is just perfect
sap speed run go go go go go shoot the
horse man
we draw these
we win these dude the horse is i'm
starting to believe that horse is just
straight garbage
maybe like two horses and something does
okay but like a horse cricket cricket is
like ideally a great start
it just but it lost to mosquito beaver
otter like how does that make sense
the only explanation is that horses
actually like do do tear
um
for now you know what two beavers do so
well though because you get the plus one
health on the sail
screw it you know what
i got shooters
double duck build
it doesn't matter like what the attack
is on a unit if it only has one hp like
it just loses there's two wins
i don't know like here's i'll tell you
why my opinion changes
on the horse every week is cause when i
use the horse i win when other people
play the horse against me they lose so
maybe it's just like a skill difference
i don't know you want to win early
there's an easy play here you sell your
otter
you buy an elephant you stab it
oh baby you stat it
honestly i think i'd rather have a swan
and we're gonna run a four squad marty
but it's weird
no we're not gonna run a four squad
marty i i counter we will not be running
a four squad marty
unless
i don't really have any interest in a
level two elephant
um
you have an elephant kill the flamingo
on turn one um
honestly i i think you play this
and then you just leave it as is
why the spider disrespect my spider only
summons snails and giraffes their spider
only summons rams and turtles we are not
the same
still a bit spicy we trade swan with
fish and then we come away with the win
i
think four squad marty three wins no
sweat
we really need to level up man
um three six crab is like not that bad
we could at least i don't want to freeze
it and make our shop worse because
honestly then it's like a three six with
meat like there's something to like
there
straight up i'm like
it's so strange but i think you can roll
this give me two mosquitoes
hold on
yeah yeah yeah yeah okay give me two
mosquitoes we combine them next turn
equipment is
greatest of all time it's like the the
goat of the year
in the early game equipment will take
you to the promised land
for once we had a badger that changed
nothing that's like highly rare
that's equipment equipment difference
are you seeing that
changes everything
combine your mosquitoes
we're very we're early enough for a worm
to pop i think
you can freeze a salad and pray
technically you could freeze an apple as
well but give me one of those i wouldn't
mind dumping a swan for some guaranteed
stance
we need uh oh dude
we we don't
this is such a surprising deal for us
we win these
i know that like the swan is tempting
but
just hit my worm oh
you peace
i'm happy with our president's squad i
i'm happy with my car insurance i don't
want to change anything even the
cupcakes like i'm not sold on
look
you peace give me give me some food that
matters
that's food that matters okay
marshall mathers
give me a double freeze we gotta we
gotta get worm going faster ideally we
get like a caterpillar the crab is not
along for this world get ready to get
rid of them
elephant is also not long for this world
but he do be packing the meat
the shmeat ball
look at that nice little turtle out of a
spider who would have thought oh
everybody
little spider you little spider freak no
turtles please
doesn't matter we win these i'm telling
you dude
double freeze apple oh no oh no he's
having a perfect run oh no
i don't want it
you have to switch to garlic the time
has come he gets a nice little stat buff
off of it all of a sudden your crab is
cracked
now you got a 413 crab with smeat the
the worms got garlic armor on it
that's a spicy one that's a spicy you
know what sometimes the odds are not in
your favor
and yet we draw these
okay
goodbye uh you know what i don't really
care if the elephant kills the monkey
the elephant is more valuable like
wait a minute why wouldn't you just do
it like this but still that's the unit i
wanted to sell salad me
salad me
you're a piece
hippo could do some work but i'm not
sweating it worm very important very
important very important enrollment he's
gone clinically insane bro i'm 601. i'm
601.
we win these
wow oh it sucks for your melanoma by the
way goodbye hippo
wow nice one you almost killed my worm
with your first two incredible units uh
actually you didn't then my crab went
buck wild wiped your whole damn squad
worm me
salad me you peace buff me
chocolate meat
that's a that's a freeze and a half
right there send me back into the
metaverse
that's a little spooky
whatever we trade
whatever we don't trade
we trade
this is
what is this what is this
what is this oh they had t-rex scaling
that's what that is that's a new piece
that's just a nasty team to run into
so you definitely go chalk a lot
i'm going to be honest with you a 69
elephant is becoming less relevant than
a mosquito possibly pinging some melon
armor but they're both not long for this
world
turtle has a place in this house i don't
know where
but it has a place
and i don't know when
uh cow me
replace clearance fill shops with food
have we encountered the rare opportunity
for a squirrel to pop
oh
if only it was a level four mosquito
what do you got here
i don't think i'm dying to ram
i don't think my crabs going anywhere
man
okay i am dying to ram no i'm not i
punched through the melon armor oh
you're toasted man
steak baby
we don't want it
honestly the worms gonna get there we
don't we don't need you we don't need
you you suck
there's something to be said i honestly
feel like now might be the time to make
that pivot
pizza me
you're an honest piece you're a piece
4949 worm honestly the monkey can go now
is this squad nasty is this squad nasty
dude honestly this crab is freaking
cracked are you seeing this
we draw these
what is that mosquito doing i wouldn't
expect you to understand quite frankly
um
i mean i'll just own up to this man
sell a mosquito
buy a freaking cat
salad me
i'm hoping to get some buffs on our crab
no sell me
buy me
in battle it says in battle my mistake
my mistake okay
yummy yummy i don't know copy their
health twice yeah this doesn't seem so
good anymore whatever
maybe they could get to be a nine one
hundred
you don't hit me through melon you don't
hit me through melon you don't hit me
through melon
i got you i got you i got you i don't
got you
i think i'm gonna get you easiest win of
my life what a name
sell me
buy me
roll me
smack
roll me
smack
i still want the worm at the front i
mean i just it's just what is best
it's what it's best at
it's where it belongs oh
whatever you're a piece you're a piece
two little pieces i don't sweat that's
ten wins that's ten wins
every time we speed run we get 10 wins
it's just that simple because we got to
be done fast
choose outcome pay out the believers i
mean we played for an hour we had 210
spots i don't know what you want me to
say



wake up honey it's sap update day
i let me go to the uh super auto pets
would
uh teamwood games twitter okay i'll give
you some patch notes you ready le i'll
even filter it for good ones versus mode
works again
it's incredible
i i don't know if you can do private
lobbies in versus mode i'm assuming you
can
but
this now opens up the opportunity for
somebody watching the stream who works
at coinbase
to sponsor us for
i was going to say 5 000 but because you
are a crypto exchange 10 000
so that we can run a streamer tournament
with with all the people that are
playing this game and we can finally
settle uh who's the best
how does that sound
um arena settings can be changed hey
check this out so you can play against
your own pack or all packs
look at that
so now you can play free to play against
everybody or just against free to play
or you could do pay to win against
everybody or just against pay to win
i think that leads to some interesting
meta possibilities here uh though i
don't know what i do know is that i did
um
free to play versus all packs and kind
of got my ass kicked
added a log out prompt that's solid fast
forward is now saved between battles
that's solid
username can be changed
why if you stop drilling you hit oil
um
other stuff no gold prompt on end of
turn if you have a t-rex
fix some bugs good stuff balance changes
this is the big stuff right you ready
dodo now only targets one minion but
gains a damage multiplier when the dodo
scales
it no longer hits multiple units instead
it hits one unit in front of it but for
two x at level two and three exit level
three i don't necessarily think that
it's uh it means the dodo's unplayable
now but i do think it means maybe it
could be like a
a sick mid-game superstar that you sell
later
like i think if you could get an early
level two
and then add like you know 12 damage to
something with garlic armor you could do
some work but
i don't i don't know about holding one
into the long term
butterfly copies from the minion with
the most health and attack combined
actually kind of a uh
kind of a nerf to the
kind of a buff to the butterfly i mean
to suggest
because before sometimes you would end
up in a situation you know you would
have like a rooster
that was uh
well i don't know maybe look let's be
honest it probably doesn't matter
but there were occasional situations if
you got an early butterfly and you had
like a 25
on your team it would copy from the 25
and then you got a 1919 just sitting
there and you're like dude i wish it
pulled from the 1919 instead but
um
anyway bad has changed to one two that
is the sort of thing that doesn't seem
like a huge deal but
it the bad didn't need a nerf hurt this
is a big one the hurt keyword no longer
triggers when you take zero damage which
means you can't put melon armor onto
uh an animal that gets a trigger on hurt
and get a free play of it which is
actually like that's a pretty big
strategy change to like you know
a camel or a blowfish or a you know
there's there's a lot of stuff going on
there
to a gorilla yeah wait that's a good
point i didn't roll the gorilla that
much but now like melon in the coconut
doesn't work as well
um that i think that's a more logical
read of it that that i mean
it sucks that the strategy is gone but
that is probably
i mean they're not hurt when their melon
armor breaks
weak is changed to give three extra
damage
i still think weak is pretty sick but
that's a much needed nerf to the bat i
still think it's not that big of a nerf
to the microbe
because
the microbes
main value is not applying weak it's in
overriding all of the
uh
equipment on your enemy and then having
a turtle that replaces your own hurt
with melon i think so i think that's
still okay but it makes the bat worse
which is good for sure
um parrot the parrot is now interesting
too
um the parrot loses its copied ability
at the start of the turn and regains his
copy ability
which means you can use a parrot as a
tiger
and for whatever animal you want to
apply it to and then do that you could
mix it up on the next turn if you decide
that it you don't want that anymore so
you could roll it doesn't imprint like
forever anymore which is nice
anyway
very cool also uh there's another like
really cool thing that they've added uh
into the game which is like if you're me
uh you get an egg head
nice golden poop well you got 5 000
points
nice golden poop congratulations
uh i only see that uh i don't know about
once every two games
that's so cool wow nice flex uh i've got
a one of one
eggshell head so uh
you know i'm not sweating it either you
roll up against the eggshell
you go holy bursh
now yes now i will be uh securitizing
uh my uh my account i will be splitting
it up
into 10 000 equivalent shares and
selling them as non-fungible tokens
wow 5 000 points for the lava mountain
or the scary forest dude you run into
the the eggshell hat on the scary forest
holy bursh
anyway let's go uh
my goal for today i would love to get a
10 win free to play versus all
that that would be
that would be optimistic for me
that i think that would be cool so let's
start there start a prediction
will we get six wins or more now i'm
telling you okay
i'm starting
free to play against pay to win i'm
gonna put my finger on the scale a
little bit i'm gonna put my finger on
the scale
all right
i recorded a video of this today free to
play versus everybody
i
went five four three in three matches
i'm just that past returns don't
generate don't guarantee future returns
i'm just saying i gotta sneeze too
what did i tell you oh
baby
we do not want a double duck build i'll
tell you that much we can definitely uh
we can roll an otter
and then two other creatures
you gotta roll first you gotta roll
first
this is so cute though oh i this was a
bad start okay
we we missed our 1-1
that's also not incredible i love that
hat man they did an amazing job they did
an amazing job the amazing heads
it's meant to be
it's perfect
uh we we should lose round one if we
draw it's a it's a miracle if we win
it's a miracle get owns
there we go
uh dude dude dude
hey dude
don't buff my
otter
i don't want you
to buff my otter
instead of dude these actually scale
like a freaking nightmare instead of
buffing my art above my aunt
or i'll recant
my love for
otter otter honor
judy
we lose these
hey jude by the way i'm just gonna say
it man i don't care who knows it
overrated
over insubordinate and churlish okay so
you buy on this one
you buy
don't combine you buy into it that way
you get the plus two plus two
you don't buy combine you buy into it
plus two plus two
i'm rolling a four squad marty i don't
give a
i don't give a crap six five and up at
the front holy
i'm a sick frick i like a quick shrimp
doesn't bother me
hey jude overrated
can i can i hit you with my beatles hot
take the hot the beatles hot take of the
day
my muscle memory leads to me by the way
hitting uh fast forward every single
time i apologize um
ringo starr's best song
is not octopus's garden ringo starr's
best song little help from my friends
that's a good dude sergeant peppers is a
great album that's a great song
that's a cold take it's a it's a good
one man we need this otter please an
otter please
he didn't write that he only sings it
well he sings well okay
shags very well by reputation
i mean
how could you not right so we got a 6 8
blowfish here we had a level 3 otter you
know we need we need a bison man
we get a bison popping and then it's
like
then we're then we're cruising i think
for now
we're not going to pill an ants
like
can i combine you if i combine you there
will be
two spaces
i'm gonna combine you to make a seven
six ants that has a b on it
um
that that will last us for like a long
time
this sucks
[Laughter]
um
and i'm gonna put a camel on here
um
just the economics of this are not great
okay
look let me just be straight up with you
a dodo is like
i don't think is very good um
but the flip side of that
is that we get two gold back next turn
and it is a body
i think we're gonna do it like
this just a temporary one the otter's
begging for a cell long term yeah short
term i mean he's a he's a dang ol seven
eight
no no turtle okay thank you thank you
like he's kind of uh he's
he's a great he's a hero careful he's a
hero
we draw these we win these we win these
there's three wins
we i think free to play might
might start
faster
uh than pay to win but pay to win scales
out of control
so we gotta be like we gotta win early
so the dodo has to go
whale eating ant is not great here
because the ant's stats are just like
top tier
it's actual buff is not that strong
i definitely think you can pursue a
level 2 blowfish for an early mid game
superstar
i think you could place it here
i think you could garlic it knowing
we're intending to invest in it in the
future i don't really want a whale here
oh it has nothing to eat
it's a little weird
you can definitely fit a crab
and have a three-nine crab out there you
can definitely
fit a peacock but it's one five and it's
a little late i i think you could also
take a rabbit
and then just try to buff the crap out
of this blowfish early and and get a
little lucky i'm gonna i'm gonna get a
little goofy here and i know this is an
unusual setup
okay what i'm actually gonna do is i'm
gonna buy a second ants
please
that way we can combine them
next turn
for a beautiful buff
and i'm not gonna now i'm like the rab
is probably a little outscaled
we combine them next turn we get
something topped here that's a level one
turtle we don't sweat that
little nasty this horse is gonna be a
little nasty
you got you got insane value there
holy birch
hold on hold on hold on hold the frick
on we win these
four wins amazing head is just is such a
good name then we combine we got an
eight seven ants
look we can scale we're not gonna scale
as fast as the best pay to win but
you know there's something to be said
for giving it a try
um
we really want to see a blowfish
kangaroo fits super nicely with this
build i just don't know like you'd have
to sell a blowfish to fit the kangaroo
you don't want to sell the otter because
the stating is pretty good um
it's a little weird i'm honestly gonna
roll like a but a simple cupcake on our
camel
level one i golden poop wow that's
really cool uh i'm not sweating because
my hat is like a one of one
i'm not sure like i don't really expect
you to understand but
oops
oops
oops
oops
cool really cool
nice nice golden poop
okay keep keep me cruising please i
don't think you're good enough man we we
need to roll for this blowfish
maybe we could think of replacing a
camel in the future
can i wait if i buy
do i get a plus three plus three
yep no
you can't like here's the thing i can't
place
i can't place it
you rolled the bison has anyone
mentioned that yet i didn't see
still it's good i like the plus one plus
one on you you know we got a scale if
we're going scaling we gotta scale you
okay in that case we don't need you
next round
please
please
just need
basically one of almost anything
would work but uh
all we gotta do is hang in there for one
more round
it's a scary squad
bit of a scary score i don't think their
rhino does much though we don't sweat
that
nice little buff on the blowfish i mean
this is a believer's paradise right here
now we can start to think about
what what 10 wins will look like
for us
good hit
great stuff okay keep that scale and go
we need that level two penguin
if we're if we're pi committed to the
squad for now and i think a camel is one
we're going to stick with then the camel
takes the buff
the winner takes it all the camel takes
the buff
frees me
holy bursh
it's finally happened
okay freeze me now we're probably imo
we're looking for a penguin but we're
really looking for something to replace
the the
otter
and get to level two asap and then the
ants
so we're once we get into like chocolate
territory that's when things are gonna
start to look a little a little
interesting
this looks this looks kind of bad for
sure i i don't know if we're making it
through the dog on this one
we're not making it through the crab
i'll tell you that much
this is also huge okay i mean
we're kind of in here
um
what can i say um with with two lives to
play with
i definitely think you can
sell penguin
well there's two ways to play it well
yeah penguin kind of sucks yeah sell
penguin sell otter
i mean the otter's a 1011.
you buy penguin and then we start doing
wall street bets build
it's actually kind of sick we could
combine you here
pretty rare for us to actually have like
a level uh the tier one unit still here
i mean
it's a bit weird
oh as a 2-2 sell me i would i value the
roll
i don't even want that next level camel
we're investing everything we got in
these levels right here yeah yeah
the two-two snail is worth less than the
the extra roll for sure
at this point at least okay this is just
screwed um the the turtle is gonna spit
out as a level two it's gonna be very
strong very strong indeed
we at least live
which means we get to purge the melon
armor on you
then you don't quite kill us purge it
purge it you peace
whatever we draw these
horse meta horse meta hello daniel
welcome to welcome to the stream daniel
hello
there there's been a big update i know
you're still playing isaac
he said don't get me wrong isaac
it's a good game
allegedly um
but i mean come on when when you're
getting involved in the super auto pets
man oh you've heard of it
[Laughter]
i didn't baby you just told me
i hate to say if you gotta do it man you
could run
a badger at the back
as like a as a moment of weakness
we're not going to do the combined just
yet we'll leave you right there
i didn't want the pill either sure okay
i mean we really basically we have two
units we have a camel and a blowfish we
should have unfrozen it but whatever
it's the same damn team
the hard bones what a name man the hard
bones
okay this is where things are going to
get a little goofy
they'll sweat that
i like my camel is getting hit but not
killed hit but not killed is very
positive for us
dude this is is kind of doing it
it's kind of doing it
that's seven wins
unfreeze me of course you peace then
give me a combine i mean a level three
ant would just be funny at this point
you're gonna buy me
you're gonna sell me
oh
i forgot about that dude honestly
like this it's so not valuable
to to go level three and via chocolate
but
we'll think about it i definitely think
you could go
snake uh behind blowfish for sure so
we're gonna freeze it for now
we are looking for
ideally
um some level ones without getting some
level ones
we're gonna go we're gonna go a little
deeper and i'm okay with it so the snake
is going to be played for now
and and possibly after that as well the
ant will be purchased next turn
you could always think about putting the
turtle involved in this situation melon
armor is pretty important
yeah
the yeah the dragon is our is our most
valuable chocolate plate
okay so we lost garlic but like losing
garlic is that's not neces oh that was a
great hit it's not necessarily the end
of our
lives uh
we draw these okay
considering that we ran up against a bat
as a free-to-play build
um i think we can be pretty pleased with
that
so i i hate to do this
well no just buy it doesn't have to be
summoned okay well then we buy you
that being said we're gonna sell this
thing
we i would love to pick up another tier
one snake later but this is like
the way that you play the dragon is you
have to play it like this
many tier ones we like it probably start
here
sell me
i would say this is a buy
put you at the back just in case roll me
once huge plays huge plays
i can't believe we still got two hp to
play with
well you know you can choose whether oh
this is a loss
ironically a snake might have done it
here but um you can choose whether you
want to play against only your build or
if you want to play against all builds
uh so right now i have the game on all
builds that's such bad luck for us um
because i'm not a coward i guess it's
not bad luck is it when it's uh
it was a rhino not a blowfish but
you you can toggle it off if you just
want to see uh
if you don't want to
see the the pay to wins in free to play
then just just toggle that
okay controversially i think this is a
buy
a cell
and then i think you put snake behind
blowfish again i'm not optimistic
freeze me
because we have uh
no melon i think melon would be would be
mighty sick right now
but garlic's doing something okay the
snake
didn't kill my snake but we're gonna run
into some issues there potentially
killed my snake
please i need to i need to kill their
snake
dude our blowfish is cracked though look
at this thing
look at this thing
big whoop
holy
[Laughter]
all right that's that's eight wins
there's a chance
look i not everybody's to be an enormous
fan of that but that's the way we're
playing it right now
sell ants that seems like a really good
idea to sell our 30 29 ant
that also gives plus six plus three when
it dies when we're on one hp
it seems like a great time to pivot from
an absolute unit of a unit
yeah and it gives us a 1 1 b
so uh watch yourself
you know for now this is a is a weird
buy
followed by a cell
you freeze the tiger
roll the behind the blowfish
yeah
technically behind the camel could do
something but
i think it's the best we could do
this is really bad
[Laughter]
that is that's a staggering amount of
melon armor but hey we got through you
nicely right there you love to see that
hit some melons please
we win these that takes us to nine wins
b actually ended up being relevant
who would have thought
now melons big that that pretty much has
to get
bought uh i don't know who on yet but
we're definitely we're gonna dump tiger
for stats
as as spicy as it might seem
if it ain't broke don't fix it it's been
doing some great work for us so far
and i hope to to get another tiger back
just for the record
honestly
i like that it's not that i'm like not
worried about like the garlic is not
that good anymore it would be nice if it
were but
the uh
it's more that the hurt doesn't trigger
on melon armor breaking anymore so i
think this was a sensible play um
i mean i don't see the parrot like you
the parrot copying the blowfish level
one ability and being a three-two that
if it gets hit for one does two damage
to a random unit seems kind of like
seems kind of doo-doo the the cow i
think is a
this is a replacement possibility
like if if we have to roll it
then we will roll it
you can roll uh so it's a little spicy
you can i would rather roll a scorpion
and hope we don't get melon armor at the
front
in case we draw we want to freeze this
but i i believe the scorpion is the
highest value play here
definitely over the plus two plus two
okay so i think we we
eat it pretty badly here
it did not work out according to plan
but just give it a sec this is the camel
looks like it's doing some good work
does the blowfish live
the blowfish lives we win these that's
10 wins
[Laughter]
but he rerolled the bison
how did he get 10 wins he rerolled the
bison my whole world view is shattered
no big deal
oops well there you go that wasn't like
my whole dream for the whole
my whole stream today so
knocked that one out early
will now get six wins or more yes
that is correct
[Laughter]
and we got the 50 achievements okay will
nl get six wins or more let's let's
stick it out with the the free to play
versus pay to win
donkey dunk
run it back
you can play this you oh you can play
this
at that price you can play this
holy you can definitely play this
beaver is a little underrated but i
rather get a 2-2 the sum is a 2-1
pouting piggies
interesting what an interesting squad we
got here
i'm not sure if i've alerted you yet to
the fact that uh
we win these i gotta stop clicking the
fast forward button now
there's one
now we do we didn't name ourselves the
piggies so this is very tempting
however
i'm not a i love a buy sell meta i just
think it sucks early
i think you i think you go with a 3-2
mosquito that pings
this is we're spoiled for choice i'm not
angry it's quite the opposite i'm very
pleased
i think we buy
to get a
horse trigger which then allows us to
turn it into a 3-3 instead of
uh like i think it would have been a
a 3-2
maybe or i don't know anyway it was
smart that's all you need to know
then straight up man
toss me a little odder a little two-two
otter that makes a 4-4 cricket would
have been nice to have multiple crickets
but you got to make compromises
in these in these positions
it's a pretty good start
and an early tier two for sure
spicy team it's a bit of a spicy team
that's a level two and holy
holy birch
um
we draw these we draw that's okay i can
live with that
now you do the early combined
it's not what you ideally want to see
early on on your on your tier three
but can i tell you if if i'm investing
in myself if i'm investing in greatness
welcome to the squad you're a temporary
4-2
this guy's hidden like a sack of
freaking bricks now
i think you might be able to make it
work with a peacock
i've been saying
i've been saying uh
you peace all the time yes i've been
saying holy birch
i called my wife a piece last night she
laughed it was it was a funny moment
between us
we lose these
i mean dude i'm like kind of in a
position right now where i'm like
don't uh
don't dog like i've been taking the dog
every time it's been working out
one in six attempts
it's not that i think it's late i think
it's just
inconsistent or maybe i don't go in
deep enough for it you know
um
you don't need to exist anymore like
these units all
are not good uh for us right now the
horse can go too i know it's it's bad
form
when we don't have anything to replace
it with but
i'm like a i'm a full believer right now
we can now i'm like i wish we didn't
sell the otter this is why you should
keep it until they're real but instead
we'll just do like a little sunk cost
fallacy
we'll buy a beaver
buy an apple
sell a beaver
buy an otter
i mean a 2-8
peacock can do some serious work
but this is it i agree i i can't be mad
right now it does feel a little bit like
a daughter's paradise
certainly do not like to see a badger at
the back when you're going up against a
bunch of like weak units
or when when i'm a bunch of weak units
this is a draw this is a win
i told you
okay we got to get um
we got to get something going here now
certainly it's a cell
into one of these
it's a nice two-nine peacock which is
actually a 310 peacock
roll me i need something i need
something better
i mean be straight up with you man
310 crab you could do a lot worse as a
as a one turn marty
there we go there we go
we're gonna be getting rid of them i
mean we you know what let's think of it
as a positive okay
don't don't you peace don't do it you
bad you bad that's fine i can i can live
with that it's not great but at least it
didn't remove my garlic
i forgot what i was talking about but
you get owned here you absolutely get
owen's here
um
we have a lot of capacity one way to
think about the negativity the the the
situation that we've got here is that
it's bad um because
we don't have a lot of good units i
prefer to think about it as uh it's good
because all of our units are um
disposable turn six i'm still going to
take the level
i mean this is this is how we do it
you could scamp this build
you can run a shrimp scampi
you start with a cell
then a buy
then a sell
then a buy
then a buy
early peacock can be a bit of a mid-game
superstar
what we don't want to see is the bat
replacing our garlic armor
level one horse is going to make this a
bit more of a problem but still not too
bad
now we wanna see garbage out of this
spider no ram please turtle is not good
but
it could be worse
we win these
mid-game superstar
that is what you are
peacock at the front
run away with me to another place we can
run yeah yeah on each other
we don't need a turtle here we do need
something i mean you could you could
sell
a rabbit
you could sell your cricket to be honest
you could put a camel up at the front to
make your peacock even stronger
rooster monkey
that's dead ass like a coward's way to
play the game
we're in free to play we got no turkey
coming
we got no
we we don't have a wide build built okay
i think that for now i don't think we
roll camo at the front i think you're
doing fine
i'll spend
i'll spend three on a one two
three into the four
well you love the bison so much chad
maybe i'll buy it free to play as turkey
since when
freeze me
this is not good now now we're oh never
mind this is well worth it
um
i know you're typing since always get
over it
are you crazy i just walked over here i
am just going to tell you i'm hitting n
turn because it's just too late for the
worm
i i know it's the first time it could
possibly show up
but it's too late for it
even
you can't
gauge like your whole
run
everything you've got in life you can't
base your decisions in life
on
what i should do because i have a
freaking
holy crap we're gonna lose this because
garlic is the greatest thing in the
world
because you have a turn one rabbit
or a tier one rabbit you can't be like
tier one rabbit i'm gonna base my whole
life on this man it's not how that's not
how she goes
what you can do is
honestly
sell me i don't want to hear it okay i
don't want to hear it
then you're going to buy me
then you're gonna sell me
then you're gonna buy me
then you're gonna sell me
you piece him me him him me
holy birch
i believe in you
i do you believe in me i believe in the
you that believes in me
um
i believe in you i be dude i believe in
you
should have canned
but
times are tough right now okay yeah this
looks this looks good this looks good we
got one unit yeah buddy but what a unit
sheep
then pill the sheep for two lobster
procs i'm gonna be straight up with you
you're either the greatest player this
game has ever seen or you're a damn fool
i've said it once i've said it many
times
nobody knows
what the hell
the lobster even does
you but you might be a damn genius by
the way we win these easily who needs
you've heard of the uh one squad marty
uh or the four squad marty how about a
one squad marty you piece
i mean at this point like
you're not long for this world
um i think you could run like a
temporary gorilla
yeah i mean i
on hurt gains coconut shield
i think you can roll the gorilla and
give it a buff
i fully but oh that's huge man i fully
expected to to not do much on our first
fight here you know what then
no
whatever it's gonna pog
oh crap
it doesn't matter that much it would
have been you know what it's nice to
have the buff anyway
okay you're gonna die here i mean this
looks like a super loss like you're not
you're not getting through that kangaroo
but this was to be expected off the
pivot
why take the buff from me
it's a good question many people are
saying this
you know you gotta go the only question
is what we replace you with for now
it's look this is gonna be
controversial
freeze me
remember we're not trying to win the
game necessarily
we're just trying to win one round so
that the believers don't cry about it in
chat so on round 10 we're rolling a
little kangaroo
coconut me coconut me
owns
that's that's big
that's not that big of a deal
is the kangaroo gonna live long long
enough to have some some merit to it oh
yes it is
yes it is
okay now
he's you but stronger he's you but
stronger
holy bursh
i hate saying that as a 32 year old man
by the way but is locked in the in the
prefrontal cortex
it doesn't have to ask me for permission
to come out anymore
okay that's not an amazing start here
in fact it's is truly god-awful thank
you snake
we still lose but but thank you
hey look at that believers barely
get paid out but they get paid out
nonetheless
you love to see it
thank you snake
thank you
many people are saying this um



hey everybody first off let me say sorry
there's been a little bit of a lack of
recorded super auto pets and the reason
for that is uh we just been insanely
busy we came down with a little bit of a
cold a few days ago that ran into the
weekend which you know also we got
normal baby stuff we've been getting her
used to daycare and today i'm on a new
schedule so it's like i'm recording this
instead of at like 7 45 in the morning
it's 2 p.m
oh my i think my brain might be in a
better place
um i should it should there's necessary
growing pains to get to a place that's a
little bit more stable now i think um
and i'm ready to get started so i played
a little bit of super auto pets this
weekend on my cellular telephone and i
did really well honestly i'm not trying
to you know gas it up
but i have a whole new tier list that's
coming out
i am i'm a big believer in the way that
i've been playing the game
uh that's not to say we're guaranteed
ten i'm just saying okay i'm just saying
like get ready
mosquitoes and otters very playable
units imo
the wet ice cubes
just uh a funny name now three three a
two two a one two with two snipes we're
hoping to see some ants we snipe
hoping to see okay they got two hp we'd
love to snipe anything with both shots
you know what we win these i i can
definitely live with that uh i respect
an otter a lot more now i i really do
i hate this shop i'm gonna use my reroll
immediately
i still do not like the shop
i am going to go fish
i'm gonna go cricket and i'm going to
buy an apple for our mosquito because it
is the unit most likely to stick around
i'm not confident in what we got here
but seeing an early mosquito on our next
shop would go a long way horses please
horses please horses gotta go oh
this is how we do
sorry i'm still a little sick that's
probably the reason i couldn't sing so
well there
this is how anyway we win these
regardless sorry sorry easy wins easy
wins
two wins already all right mosquito me
no mosquito
i will take a fish
i will roll
i will combine my mosquitoes
and i will i'm going to get a little
freaky here i'm going to buy two ants
this is not where i want to be i'd i'd
much rather have paired up and or triode
up and level the unit but
it's it's okay
a little seven six that's nasty that's
nasty
we lose these uh
we lose these fair enough
i was i was trying to find some copium
but
i think that uh that's fair our shops
have not been sublime so far i will
invest
i love a turtle man i love a turtle
it's tough the reason i would keep an
otter like mosquito and fish are staying
because they're close to leveling up and
their stats are pretty good it's between
otter and cricket
um
personally
i like what an otter brings to the table
later
if we can get it to level up one time
it's not necessarily too late for a dog
i think as much as i hate to say it like
maybe it's it served its purpose there
um another dog is huge we get a pill so
we can
pill you probably to have more space to
do some summons in the future there's a
few options here swan is though it's
freezable i think we could lose this
round pretty easily as well to be honest
i i'd i'd settle for a draw not that i
have any control over it
um
s77 crab a little spicy
melon armor always nice maybe it's not
spicy at all that melon armor just saved
us huge
that could have
that could have gone much worse
you can definitely just keep a turtle
for the record but i think we're gonna
start here
i don't mind this i don't mind it we'll
go here
yummy
here
this is another yummy status i think and
then
we got a 7-7 portal up here i think you
just put a 3-4 swan back um we're
looking for uh like later we're
definitely looking for some more stuff
but i like our stats i like the turtles
effect right now
we are running into a garlic whale which
is a little scary killed their worm
probably not relevant
[Laughter]
that's okay though you love to see good
garlics go a long way man
and you're spitting now what
one two cricket no sweat okay so we're
already at four this is this is good
four wins one loss we want to keep the
pace up early straight up let me tell
you
i love a crab
we would be trying to get this crab
to copy the hp of our highest hp unit
it's a little late but it doesn't take
much for a crab to get going
we it just sucks that we can't put meat
on the crab if we put it behind the
turtle because the melon armor will
override the turtle i think you can sell
your swan i'm still i'm perhaps naively
believing our fish is one day gonna pop
i think you can do this we're gonna look
for some meats
we we have to immediately basically say
no to this but that's okay because
there's there's good reason for it
um
i don't know what i was thinking there
you start here
nice
nice
and then
honestly
i think you go turtle
and i think you roll a four squad marty
here
i don't want a skunk oh we don't need to
roll four squad marty we can summon one
more unit
still good still very good so now our
mosquito can can kind of go
honestly out of like all these
i think you just summon a skunk and you
get the buff at least and then you pray
i'm happy with where we have for turn
six but we we can do better we don't
have not everything's perfect yet but
that's okay
that's nice
that's acceptable
hmm
we lose this but it wasn't that bad and
i have faith in our future uh dog
scaling now
uh we don't need another crab we finally
got our other otter but it took a long
long time so we know like the skunk is
gonna go and the mosquito's gonna go
tube we just don't know when yet uh the
worm on turn seven
in my opinion it's early enough but we
wanna spend our gold on scaling our dog
first so this is probably a no thank you
but
we don't sweat that that's okay
this is a roll because the crab gets no
value from leveling
we definitely like um
a monkey here
among us
i think you sell your otter buy an otter
i love the stats here
that's fine we'd like you to get some hp
at some point just for the record
um get the monkey ideally like a monkey
scaling a turtle's not really what we're
looking for but
i think we actually our five-five
mosquito we don't care for i think we
roll once
and we can sell the five-five mosquito
in favor of uh another monkey
and then we actually don't need garlic
on anybody because of the way this is
gonna shake out but um this is like the
ultimate proof of concept of whether
this new scaling meta i've been touting
actually has a chance to work um we
shall see i suppose
so far it looks pretty solid
[Laughter]
i know you're gonna say that uh you know
double uh monkey on a turtle doesn't
seem that incredible hey a 50 50 does
what a 50 50 does it doesn't really
matter what it applies to so i honestly
think you now say no to your crab
you could probably say yes to a can
and it looks a little like this
not ideal looks a little like this
can you just get like some hp
like it i like that you're doing 21
damage don't get me wrong but there's
there's more to life than this okay you
need garlic armor you're gonna think i
lost my mind
i i'm fully invested in the world of
scaling
so our dog and our turtle are the only
units that matter right now but i'm a
believer in this
man if they had a whale we would have
been in a rough spot man okay that ox is
terrible luck but
it's okay
yeah we lose this
[Laughter]
we still lose this but it was like not
as bad as it originally looked
i think the monkeys will do fine i think
the penguin's in a rough spot
five wins
and of course then they give me the
extra penguin in case i wanted one but
um i think i think this is okay you
gotta stick around your stats are too
good to get rid of quite frankly
i'm still a believer here i honestly
think if our dog didn't get saddled with
like the worst hp you could ever imagine
we would feel better about this
four gold puts us on four i i normally
maybe wouldn't be such a huge fan of
this but i do like the summon trigger
you pray for the best the best happened
i still think if we have to we could
roll a penguin
um
with god as my witness i feel like our
best outcome here comes from four
squatting
and we could think about maybe playing a
uh
a kangaroo afterwards i'll admit we're
in full like gigabrain territory here
but let's just see i see some golden
poop i'm a simple man i see golden poop
i laugh i laugh at it
and we win easily that'll take us to six
you can roll rabbits man like
we're getting into some seriously spicy
territory
but watch this okay i know you don't
believe in this but watch it
combine me
buy me
buy me
freeze me roll me
well this is the easiest freeze of my
life um
okay you
combine me
buy me
and then feed me feed me
now we're starting to get somewhere 3127
melon armored dog 2425 level 2 turtle in
front of it
i'm not saying it's guaranteed i'm just
saying
if we talk about classics does my name
get brought up
it appears that my name get brought up
that takes us to seven
well the cow can go
i think we respect the turtle
although
i don't know if we're ever gonna want
you know what we probably wouldn't say
no to it plus we get the stat benefit
out of it
come on the beaver we're just hp please
man hp is worth like okay that's
something
we're overspending on this and and i
would do it again
freeze me a pizza just in case
oh it's like this is the dream you want
to roll a uh a scorpion up at the front
they're not gonna have
a unit that is going to kill us with
melon armor like it's just not the the
worst case scenario for us and this
sucks is the monkeys buffing it but
whatever the worst case scenario here is
they have a unit that sucks at the front
now luckily that did not happen
and all of a sudden we're kind of like
we're chilling are you seeing this
we're bing chilling right now eight wins
nobody believed in the turtle man
nobody believed in him
now
i think we're still early enough and a
scorpion could show up later you sell
your scorpion
you buy a little cat
buffs your dog
give me a quick roll
we're looking for food that does
something that seems to maybe this is
where we got confused with one another
you can freeze a tiger
you could roll a tiger behind the monkey
that might be the play but i'm gonna
i'm gonna try to shoot for the moon here
and even if i miss
mayhaps i still land amongst the stars
winning early is the is the best thing
you can do for your for your life and
for your health
and i feel like we're doing a great job
of that right here
nobody believed in the deck man nobody
believed in this and here we are at nine
wins
riddle me this
honestly
dance with the one who brought you there
take a little buff
keep that tiger around
that tiger is like it's just in case
right now it's a just in case
ah but it only works in battle and in
battle yeah you're not relevant to me in
battle
ergo i sleep maybe we'll try something
like this a little stake on our monkey
fire in the sky
uh you should probably put the monkey no
cause then the the melon armor would
override it i mean this is for 10 wins
what can you say
this is scary squad
but that's great icon no we're gonna
lose
but for that to get the nine wins like
for me is honestly
that's a ten win build wrapped in a nine
wheeled a nine win deck because
we
had a mid game that was super messy and
yet we still managed to get my strat to
pop off can i tell you something this is
the worst shop you could ask for
i would rather have three ducks to at
least commit to the the insanity um
but you can roll i mean this is not a
good squad but we can try it again so
i've been all about like in my free to
play life
hold on
let's be the
i'm not saying we're an underdog i'm
just saying edible underdog has a nice
sort of ring to it you know
um
these animals are not high on my tier
list
but we win because of an incredible
mosquito shot the schrutinator
my new meta is all about scaling
we buy a fish because we want the otter
to hit the fish now it's a high
percentage roll like this
it's okay
that's okay now you can sell a pig and
buy a bee but that's not
good at all uh we'll freeze this we'll
put you at the front you just behind you
just behind
this i'm now actually very pleased with
what we have going on here it's all
about stats
winning early and scaling i will tell
you i'm scared of the two damage that
they're doing to everything here
that's such a that is an incredible
build
nothing but respect for my stingray
there that would that you deserve that
one that's ingenuity you don't see that
too much in the modern era
we can buy
you're okay like a three five i'm
willing to roll
and then sell
we're gonna be at eights you gotta think
about this one i love a crab in this
game man
i'm i'm willing to believe that the crab
will get there
it's not there yet so this is dangerous
but
hey like it's not a big deal all you
need to do is give me like one of
basically any other unit that we have
um but apparently that's like too much
to ask for i hate to say it um
i really do
but
on
okay
on
turn three if you get a dog you kind of
gotta
give it a try this is a it's a horrible
start we've had bad shot blocks so far
and the the second group we ran into is
just like
very well constructed you got to respect
it we're going to lose this one too
they're stated up up the you-know-whats
i mean there's just no chance
the flopping balls
okay we gotta we gotta get some wins out
of this we gotta eke out some wins
i tried
don't don't be too proud to pivot
i think we got two sales left in us so
we're gonna roll
don't hit you don't hit you okay good
good good
sell me will put me on six
i'm this is a mess man i don't know what
i'm doing
i'm now running
another crab but at least it allowed us
to fit
a little bit more uh yeah sure no no
like that at least it allowed us to get
some more summon triggers on our dog
this is really bad
this is like we're we're in a bit of a
tailspin right here
that's acceptable then we get some okay
trades that's not good okay so we're
gonna be on one life
the downside of the scaling meta is when
you don't get early pairs you're in a
real nasty spot
so i'd love to pill you but
if this is how it has to go this is how
it has to go
you know you're getting sold
it's like not really worth a buy sell
here but i'm in such a precarious
position i feel like we must give it a
try we can now roll the crab here a meat
is an incredible get it does not come to
pass so be it
we can
roll once
i was looking for sell meat honestly
instead i'm gonna sell garlic and i i
fully believe in the power of this squad
for this round in particular for future
rounds no not at all but garlic early is
incredible by the way so is rooster
early so they got they got something
pretty special going on there but we got
our squad is gonna
he's gonna have a pretty reasonable
chance to do some good stuff i think
holy burst
we still win
i'm not gonna talk crap about anybody's
horse build given our current situation
but
it is what it is now i love turtle i'm
just not sure it's the right fit for us
here
yummy we really need this level two dog
man
this okay this now we're talking uh now
we're talking
now we're talking i was originally gonna
go bunny but now we're talking
freeze me a meat
the otter is still good it's a pear
every time we upgrade it
i think you got to go like this
the fish don't fall into the trap of
thinking you need to keep this fish
forever freeze me both of these
and i'm i'm yes this is why i kept the
fish temporarily at least i am if we get
through this round we've got an engine
now to get us going but we got to get
through this round
turtle and a big kangaroo can be a
little spicy
we're gonna we're gonna die on the first
kangaroo shot which is unfortunate but
we're gonna
now we're gonna get you that's that's
not even that big of a deal okay so
we're clawing our way back i believe in
the stats that believe in me okay
how are we gonna fit this here
wait a minute how are we gonna fit this
here
are we gonna i think we're gonna sell an
otter
that allows us to fit a bunny
capacity is a real issue right now which
is bad for our dog but we get a level up
here
you gotta sell the fish i know you're
gonna look at this like i've lost my
mind
you have to sell the fish
i buy you
five gold i buy you two gold
you need the meat
i buy i buy you
it's weird don't get me wrong this is
weird and the order is all messed up but
just work with me okay i buy you
that's important extremely important the
health not so much the attack yes i buy
you
i sell you
i buy you do you trust me do you trust
me
this if you're if you're not gonna trust
me this is a great time to believe that
i'm doing the wrong thing because it is
a high chance to go wrong if you do
trust me get ready to reap the rewards
that trust can enable
we got we already clawed our way back to
breaking even we're gonna go a little
bit further we're gonna try to go a
little bit further
rooster is always good which is why i
say no to it
i don't mind a double salad
i don't know what just happened uh we
don't have a level three nor are we
likely to get one
we don't need any extra food if anything
we need another unit that works well
here a turtle is not really it
we need to go a little further
we need to go one further
not good
in that case we buy salad i'm not buying
a spider if we could buy some salad you
don't need the hp mint you don't need
the hp this this one's also a little
spicy but remember we basically got like
a 14 27
crab back there your hippo's doing
nothing
your bison got through congratulations
you're because of your skunk your bison
got through but my crab is going wild
this one goes out to all the people who
said the crab is no good
i've been playing crab all weekend
and it's been leading to this you can
use a parrot to copy a monkey to buff
the dog faster which also buffs the crab
faster
i'm okay with that because this is not
giving us the scaling i was asking for
squirrel is just tough to fit honestly
like you know you gotta
it's just a tough one to roll now i'm
like dude screw that okay we don't need
a second monkey when we have a monkey
lovely that's that's you couldn't ask
for anything better than that
romy
salad it's not that good
i've been buying it but it's not that
good i've been buying it because i'm a
fool
cupcake
there's something to it but we could
also get ready to sell our rabbit
sometime soon every run here like every
battle is a serious chance for failure
but i think we've built a squad i'm a
huge believer in like the only two units
that matter are your front two units if
you build your run that way
and we're it's it's proven pretty nice
here like we gotta look kind of a
foolproof formula for getting the two
wins at least can we get further than
that nobody knows yet
uh i think it's too late for warm we're
we're doing some investments here this
we could keep but one one moment please
that's good
then obviously we're gonna we're gonna
fuja
you're almost at peak scaling at which
point we're going to need something else
we don't really want to scale a scorpion
yet though
i think you freeze an otter and just
work with me on this one
i'm going to go quick salad because it
does give us a benefit we're wedged in a
bit of an awkward spot here two monkeys
is not bad we're really looking for that
third monkey so that we can then combine
them and then start to work on a new
new piece of this ecosystem in this is
terrible news
um their their scorpion just bodied me
hard countered hard countered
we win these
[Laughter]
we win these what is that seven okay
seven wins
is beautiful
it's it's a dream now
combine me
come by me
by me
sell me
buy me
we could have combined them but i'm
gonna sell this one anyway so i know it
was better to do it this way so that we
ended up with three gold instead of two
which allows me to do what i wanted to
do which put a snake right there
now that snake is going to be behind an
11 47
it should get a few attacks in there
they got their own snake they got a
tiger backing it up which is a little
spooky in its own right but i like the
way our stats look
it did not kill our snake this this
bodes well this bodes well
now i would love to sell a bunny and get
a get a tiger going we're up to eight
wins
i think you can sell a bunny in general
so that you can get the extra dog
triggers even though you're close to
maxon
i mean it just
i don't know if i see this one quite
frankly but uh
you can roll a turtle uh and and
consider it a an option for melon armor
in the future
for now i know this looks weird to say
no to the snake but i
you know put some trust in me look i've
gotten you this far
you don't really need another dog is
that i think you freeze it and look for
a unit you can actually stick you know
somewhere in here and and be happy with
it
i don't know what that is
like honestly i think you play a turtle
at the front i know that looks weird it
steals a buff it doesn't do much for us
um
but
i think it's the best unit to fit there
and we could pill it in the future
we may lose this i mean i don't think we
will it's only a level one rooster
i don't think we will
garlic admittedly would have been better
still here but
you you got to make the pivot from
garlic to melon at some point
and there's a pretty soft pivot
considering we we still actually have
garlic we just have a turtle instead
like look at that that's nine wins
from from the depths of of despair we've
clawed our way out here
um
so i'm not fully sold on this turtle
admittedly
but
whatever
thanks for the buffy piece it's
definitely not fly territory i think we
still keep you frozen in general
um
i mean
it's something to be said for but really
like more than anything else i'm kind of
just looking for a scorpion and i'm
willing to roll pretty deep for it
doesn't have to be a scorpion it could
be like something
just
useful
double food is nice like technically i
guess we could we could bring a cat out
here and then that's unfortunate but we
could throw a cat out here and then do a
nice little
i forgot money's a thing
you peace
straight up
four squad marty for the win
the theory checks out i've run all the
calculations
how sick would this be man how sick
would this be you don't kill me you
don't kill me only i can kill me only i
can kill me that's 10 wins nobody
thought it would happen
what is that 18 win 19 win video that's
the power of scaling admit i'm willing
to admit i thought it might have been a
flash in the pan
no no no no no hey thanks for watching
hope you enjoyed it if you did click the
like button helps out a great deal of
course subscribe you want to see more in
the future
for now thanks for watching i'll see you
next time see ya



you all doubted me
[Laughter]
when i did the tier list crab crab the
eight-tier crap what are you talking
about crab in the a-tier crab
are you kidding me well guess what it's
not so funny anymore is it anyway we're
back
good early shop it looks like this it
looks like this
it looks like this there's nobody i'd
rather have taken this guaranteed plus
one plus one it looks like this please
please give me a four five fish
admittedly we could have run a two three
and then guaranteed a four five fish
which actually might have been the play
but oh two one twos
probably beats it two three i don't know
either way the four five is awesome um
what the heck is glistering it'll be the
concerned clementines in lieu of
anything cleverer alliteration gets the
job done it's a nasty squad early
we win these uh
i love the otter with the hat on
sideways that's so good got your pants
real low the hat turned sideways looking
like a fool with your fish on the ground
uh next if we get one more otter we're
off to the frickin races i like a
mosquito i don't love it
i like a mosquito
then honestly you're not gonna hear this
out of me too often
i think
in this rare unique situation
given the exact shop composition we have
i feel semi-confident rolling a duck i
think it's borderline i i think a duck
is the worst tier one unit i understand
the idea of its future scaling capacity
potential um
this looks pretty bad man
we lose these we lose to a 2-2 duck
given the shop i'm not sure what we
really maybe a cricket gets us out of
that but um i i think we made a
i think we did relatively reasonably
intelligent thing so how do you start
this
you start with a sail
don't hit the duck that's fine that's
totally fine
give me the level don't hit the duck
i'll i'll accept the mosquito that
allows us to then sell the duck
which buffs some units we actually
respect
i think we'll combine a fish now we've
got a five six we're gonna keep this
otter around for the time being we'll
keep the flamingo for the time being
we'll roll you as well we'll we'll hold
this
it's a weird squad right now but the
stats are actually pretty awesome
uh and and i have the duck to thank for
that a little bit but i don't think the
juice is worth the squeeze hey lucky us
lucky us uh this is worse for you than
it is for me quite frankly
yeah
i was not confident in that while the
particle effects were happening but
i believed i believed in general now can
you force a crab
into any build
i don't know man that's a crazy question
uh i think we can say that our mosquito
is not long for this world
the otter is gonna stick for a bit
though
but i think we got a
kill
this will be a crab investment here
just for the time being i'm confident
running a swan for a bit not for long
but for a bit sure
i'll combine i'll run a quick
combination there
i don't love this squad just for the
record
but
we are two in one it's round four
i feel like we're we're not in a
horrendous position
that's a little lucky for sure
this is the same guy
it's actually a great time to have a
crab
holy crap
it's the same outcome
okay lucky us
come on give it give us some combos this
is what we want it's round five we get a
combo
combo you gotta try an early worm
and the crab will fit nicely with the
worm so get rid of this level two water
as much as i like it
its time has come
you're gonna take one of these you're
gonna take one of these we're gonna roll
one time
you freeze two snails this would be a
lovely time to lose
it's a weird one man i think we can sell
our fish so we can roll one time
and i don't love these rolls but
that's okay
should give me a five seven oh
probably the blowfish is more likely to
get sold just for like level up purposes
i don't know i feel like you might
benefit there obviously this gives you a
plus one plus one as well we gotta stall
a little bit on that one uh you know
you know you know you know it's
didn't really matter in the whole scheme
of things i
miscalculated drastically
freeze me
shop mismanagement of the highest order
but
this would be actually a good time to
get an accidental slash intentional loss
it would hit the spot honestly get him
get him
that's huge
well it could be huge but that's fine
did we get you did we get you we do
eight damage we get you we own you
somehow we win these i'm actually kind
of unfortunate because we don't get the
snail scaling but that does take us to
four wins already feeling kind of groovy
just makes you want to it
now we need food it's not the best food
but
it's food
straight up man i'm like
sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do
you know what i mean you know what i
mean when i say that sometimes you got
to do what you got to do you got to
invest in the here and now not worry so
much about the future a live for today
plan for the future pack a lunch in hall
a
we can fish
that is running into a bat
it's been a while sorry i've been
playing free to play for too long
this looks this looks good man this
somehow we're up to five wins with a bit
of a a bit of a potpourri but we need we
we have future scaling we just need to
keep it moving
again you prove useless but that's not
your fault let's let's get you going
here we need some permanence
it's like i just didn't think that a
swan was gonna get there for us but
maybe i'm mistaken let's let's freeze it
real quick
the bunny is what we want so the fish
you had your chance
for now give me a swan
that way we can freeze a bunny roll it
later and get a little benefit out of
this for the time being
that's the food baby that's the food
you're only an eight eight though that's
that's not as good as it was when we had
you with double cupcake
but you know you roll up against the
perfect squad
you never know
you never know
that would have been a nice one to kind
of beat the odds on
you're going down on this one we
deserved we deserved it we kind of
scaled weird
but we still got five wins we're on
permanent turbo speed give me a combine
give me a bunny give me a buy give me a
buy we're going hard on the worm here
but
it scales quite nicely and it scales in
line with the crab which is beautiful
too
i'm gonna be honest i think you'd freeze
that
i'm gonna be doubly honest i think you
can sell a blowfish
this is where i'm now in i'll admit i'm
in crazy town okay
also known as washington d.c
hiyo um but anyway i i still i think
that this is the way you get there
i think this is true
we may regret our our words and our
deeds this one's going to be another
loss oh no because we got rid of your b
with the melon armor that's a draw
that's a beautiful draw
would a one if you had another unit yeah
but we might not have one we might have
the other unit might have lost actually
depending on how our worm does but
regardless i digress we buff you we buff
you
i'm not sure how i'm honestly never mind
i think i know how i feel about this
give me a pair you piece
i think i don't know if the freezes will
actually work for us
i'd love to freeze the chocolates and
get you to one more so here's what i'm
going to try i'm going to try a double
freeze we'll see if those stay frozen
we're going to buff you
now we got a 24 30 worm with garlic
armor which will have like an 8 30 crab
behind it
essentially
you doubted me
and you were
you were in the right too you were in
the right to doubt me
[Laughter]
hold on we still got a life to play with
right
we kept both of them in
grab me i mean chocolate me that's what
i meant holy birch
i can already i can already hear the
gamers out there yes yes
he's finally gonna lose he's finally
gonna realize that scaling meta is not
the way oh really
we'll see about that
this actually looks like a nightmare
build
at least it's only a level uh one
rooster
holy crap we draw we draw these we draw
these okay we got the worm is basically
is where you need it to be to
do well now we can start to think about
other stuff
we're going to need at least one more
good unit i think is what we're
realizing that being said screw that
buff me
yummy yummy
i honestly think we could do a lot worse
than a can freeze me roll me
this is exactly what i'm looking for the
squirrel has no purpose on this earth
anymore
uh
i'm gonna say for now can me even though
it doesn't benefit our scorpion can me
regardless freeze that for the future
and then this is where we start our
march to 10 wins
this is a scary squad
but it's not that scary
yeah actually it's not scary at all
never mind
um that takes us to six so this would
already be a believer's payout on what
most people are considering to be a bit
of a strange one
i think we can
that's important for like just in case
in the future we don't need to scale the
worm anymore
if we're not going to scale the worm we
got to find something else to scale
how much do you trust me
none okay good let's do it what if our
scorpion had 50 hp
just throwing that out there
come on you peace
what if what if our scorpion had
seven hp
has a scorpion ever killed two units
no melon i see no melon
i'm i'm gonna try something you've never
before seen the rumors of super auto
pet's death are greatly exaggerated
we're completely rewriting the code for
the meta in front of your eyes this is
the matrix
i love where you're at right now i'd
like you to have some more attack but
you gotta
you know
i mean technically i guess we could
pretty easily get a bunny going here
to the next level i gotta be honest with
you i think we have an obligation to do
this followed by this
and then if we want to win a game we'll
freeze a tiger for the future put a
snake behind our sick crab here but i'm
really i'm gonna believe in the scorpion
dream
i believe that we can get a scorpion
that gets two kills it hasn't happened
yet and it scales really badly against
melon but it does really well in this
exact situation right here
i know i this time because i believed it
as well when we lost those early games i
was like this is over we stand no chance
well here we are standing a chance
we don't go cat i love the snake
although we could temporarily say
goodbye to you
to take a cat
meow by the way
let's go 8 14 scorpion we're kind of
getting there
that you really need more health
on the other hand
please just one pizza hit the front
1420 scorpion
they said it couldn't be done the
strongest unit in super auto pets
history
it's happening
it's actually happening now you got a 50
50 back there that's got me feeling a
certain sort of way we may slash
definitely will still lose this
but
they said it couldn't be done that's an
eight win
a disappointing eight win
but
maybe a scorpion can scale
we showed people even a scorpion can
scale this is a dangerous shop here
early
you can you can do it it's not it's not
that bad
something like that
we want to we want to go up against
horses please
be in the inedible battle it happens
sometimes you want a bagel you have to
buy a six pack of them
you got one still in there just growing
blue
terrible news we lose these but there's
just i mean three four fish is very good
you did great work there
you just got a better squad man what can
you say
i hate to be the one saying this but
this team
admittedly may be better to roll an ant
but this team
might lose here but it scales us into
the future which is the reason i hate
duck
oh but killing that horse is pretty
sweet
i think we win these
okay so coming out of the early game
with a 1-1 i really want to have zero
losses but it's okay life goes on
you definitely roll the combine early
and you can keep it going like
i think you can you can take the
blowfish as a mid game
uh well really early game superstar we
can freeze you
roll once i honestly let's freeze you as
well i know it's a little perspective
but um
i don't mind this
i'd like if we can get a beaver to level
three it opens up the chance to to get a
uh a bison popping off
you never know what happened what
happens from that point onward
nice little crab here i see you see a
little shrimp scampi very interesting i
think we lose these man
that's a nasty team how'd you get how
did you get such good stats early that's
not that i'm upset because i mean
come on um
science would tell you to run a dog here
science doesn't know what the heck is
talking about okay
we're living in a different world now
i think you already know what's
happening
it looks a little bit like that
and then yeah science would probably
also be like hey
don't roll an 8-7 beaver
if if science hates having fun then just
call me
anti okay don't call me anti-science
but
i'm pro-fun there's a difference
wow dude honestly we're just going up
against the scariest teams i've ever
seen in my life here early like turn
four their whole team was eight eight
how does such a thing happen
i'll tell you how it doesn't happen
again something like this something like
this
something like this
frees me
i'm a huge
i know how this sounds i'm a genuine
believer that i mean we said it a few
times here and oh what is this this 1110
mosquito no though they got hedgehog
builds
they've been building it jeffy jerry
they've been building hedgehogs
we have the same amount of hp on our
units but we might we got there
you peace
i respect you you scared me i respect
you that was a spicy build
roll me
juice me
buff me
i i still believe we can get there man i
know we've said it before but we we've
gone from like one hp to eight wins a
few times this is a scary team uh yeah
for that reason predominantly um
but uh they got garlic on everybody
equipment is honestly like goated too
bad you still lose
nice try
now this is where the fun starts the
mosquito
or the blowfish neither really has any
reason to exist anymore
now the question i guess is as nice as
this beaver is oh
eyes pop out of his head tongue rolls
down would you rather get a hippo and in
most situations i think i could be
persuaded to say yes in this unique
situation i'm gonna say no because if we
die we lose like straight out the gates
so
i'm gonna instead
it would have been nice to know that was
coming but i'm gonna invest in some
statistics here i'm gonna try to get
this beaver to pop off at an early bite
early-ish at least bison
if we can just scale
our units faster than enemies will scale
with their look at
i just love this man they look at this
cute little build they did that creates
that awesome otter i got this is rude
but that still gets crapped on by me
just having
uh
hold on oh yeah yeah well that what i
was going to say it still gets cramped
on by me just having a strong units okay
so you roll double monkey that's the
gimme fish doesn't have to be long for
this world but either fish or beaver
needs to get to level three in order to
get a bison to work
and give us some default scaling no
thank you no thank you
no thank you
no thank you
i'm willing to go pretty deep on this
this is important you get upgraded
you're nice but we don't need you right
now
then the bison comes out
next turn probably the bison starts
getting buffed instead because it's
going to buff
faster than the beaver but we need to
put the melon armor on at first in order
for it to really get there so this this
is now a proof of concept oh that's real
bad
we lose
i deserve that um i was getting a little
cocky
but we still i mean even on our worst
loss man that's a that's a four win and
things were horrible to start with
do you trust me
what if you just had a 4-5 fish
holy
give me one of these too
the
huge
hikers
i don't know man like
i'm not sure this is gonna work but
he do be a big unit
this seems like a build that that
counters us like basically perfectly so
maybe uh this is a situation where two
two threes would have done it well one
two three and a three four would have
done a little better
alas that's not how that's not how we
played it
now i love this squad though look at
this squad
i hate that we lost that first round
there was there was probably no need for
that let's go
we draw these
sorry we got a huge fish coming out
what did i tell
you um
i think if you want to win rounds
i like an otter but
it's it's far from where we want it to
be right now but we can at least get an
elephant
i think it
sell me
come by me
sell me
roll me
buy me
combine me
this is a freezable i know it might not
look like it
roll me we're go we really
really want to see another fish
it's not implausible that we get one
we get two levels up great stats on all
the units
you peace by the way you peace
great stats on all the units um
early bison technology i mean this was
like a big win for us for sure so we're
already broken even we are playing a
little fast and loose with it
look
i'm not against it i'm not against it
i'm not against it i love stats
don't be a piece you peace
give me a fish
meat's good enough meat is is more than
playable
what a squad we got here kind of
i thought this game was supposed to have
more than two animals in it just kidding
that's a beautiful trade
i think we're looking
we're looking okay man we're looking
okay that's a nice win for us
that's two wins please please
just a single fish is all it takes
we don't even need to combine yet like
we could run you
like that
i honestly feel like i don't know i
don't know yet okay
i think something like this is for the
best but then roll me
okay we're on round five
you could persuade me
early
worm has some merit
i think
we're spending too much on rolls
however combining selling an elephant
running two bunnies and a worm
so you're saying there's a chance
i don't know maybe you tell me what do i
know
this is interesting as long as we kill
the horse i'm not sweating because we
kill you and then we kill you i don't
even talk about the four squad marty
anymore if you see me do it sometimes
it's an accident but
sometimes
i just know what's up okay so we're
gonna forget the stat level ups now
we're just gonna send you out there as a
seven eight with some meat on you we're
gonna sell you we're gonna do a buy buy
we're gonna get you we're gonna freeze
you roll once
i don't mind this i honestly think you
do freeze a crab
now we got a two a three five worm
a three five worm our only units that
matter are the first two units they
gotta carry us for a little bit this was
our big spend turn to get things set up
you certainly don't like to see an 11-11
mosquito back there however
we're actually gonna draw this one
that's not that's perfect on a on a
heavy pivot like that to get a draw
we're not upset
and then we're gonna feed you
we're gonna start to think about getting
a crab out there we probably honestly
we're gonna start to think about selling
our fish
um
i totally think we can do that
makes our crab stronger you know what
frees me one of these
i do i like a bunny i do like a bunny
but for now
give me a nice
little munch on the salad there
that makes our team much better we got
an 814 that needs some equipment they do
hate to see an early rooster but an
early rooster with bad stats versus
garlic armor is a nice setup for us
as you can probably tell okay one swan
finishes the job there
there's our break even it's like our
first
first point at which we go okay this
good honestly you're gone i'm just gonna
be real with you you had your chance
fish to to pog off you didn't get there
don't cry about it it happens we got
three bunnies now
all of a sudden
this guy's eating good
i mean i don't see why you would pivot
off of this to a crab yet
like
we might as well enjoy the three bunny
action while it's happening we're gonna
give you one of those we're gonna give
you a meat probably but a garlic on the
worm will do some nice stuff for us here
it's a 1732 worm on like turn six
it's very good stuff oh no you shot my
bunny
too late it's it's efficacy has already
come to pass
we do lose this one that will not happen
in the future
you got me and you know what the
crocodile had no impact but i wouldn't
expect the tier list haters to
understand that
give me one of these thanks for the hp
continue rolling me
give me one of these pray it hits the
worm
it's better to be lucky than good
combine me
and then get the crab out there
huge this will be a combined next turn
you know what frees me it's still good
probably like i don't know maybe i look
at it like this on i'm telling you on
turn nine a 20 41 worm with garlic armor
is gonna ruin some people's days it's
gonna make some people highly upset
you're shooting units that literally
don't matter
your crab is laughable it makes me laugh
like kanye west's fake laugh from late
registration all of a sudden there we go
we're on five wins okay we don't really
care for a
a penguin to be honest with you we'll
level up a little bit here we got no
space that's okay i'll tell you what
take one of these
still get the two hp out of it
don't you give me a little double meat
i know you're you're at peak health but
it's well at this point if you're a peak
health we can start to scale another
unit
um and it won't be a cow
and it won't be a turtle
you could start to think about just
leveling that swan as as
hilarious as it sounds
you could start to think about leveling
a swan and i'm i'm in being completely
honest with you when i say that
we're hoping to maybe get a pair we
don't get a pair life goes on why don't
you give me
one of those at least it hit properly
i am not scared for the time being i'm a
little scared of the late rounds but
this is why we're investing right now
that scorpion that scorpion is perfectly
placed that's a perfectly placed
scorpion you look they're doing the same
thing they gotta they got a full food
build going on here you gotta respect it
okay we we're down to one hp now just
don't don't make me play against them
again they know what they're doing i
would rather not
scorpion in front of your your strongest
unit it's a genius level strategy
we don't have one for ourselves that's
fine
we do want meat for you i mean you know
what
it'll be fun
cows please cows please
another swan like it's a 1-1 who cares
not me
you can definitely fit a snake
i don't think you do it yet
that'll be important later
okay don't lose this round we roll the
snake behind the crab
very interesting
it's a fly turkey build please go to the
kitchen grab a snack
as of right now i'm i'm not markedly
perturbed but things can change things
can change on a dime in this game i see
that we have flies coming out
okay there's your fly it has now been
killed and buffed and now
you just got a 7 8 back there that's sad
nice turkey fly build where'd you find
that the subreddit sorry that was rude i
apologize uh
well melon armor is good
we have to consider making an investment
you're you're just not doing as much
damage as i thought you should be at
this point
but that's okay
i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and say
give the swan a little love here
i'm gonna say forget the melon for now
no that's crazy
i'm gonna say you take the melon for now
i'm gonna say we buy one of these
and then i think it's time
you can dump the cow temporarily roll
once
look i was gonna roll the cow again but
or i was gonna roll the snake
immediately but i think
just in general we probably do a little
bit better with this
try to maybe roll this squad right here
the the problem is their hp has scaled
so much faster than their actual uh
damage that i feel like why would i want
to keep rolling these teams right now
like why would i want to keep buffing
them it seems like buffing them is
idiotic and yet i feel like we got to
keep buffing them because they buff
everything else but either way
we're coming out of this with a loss
due to the low damage on us and that's
that's a disappointing six win but hey
life goes on i had a good time
regardless um we still did well
but maybe we went a little bit too heavy
on the memes but for now thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed it if you did
click the like button upset a great deal
thanks for watching i'll see you next
time see ya



sap will probably be unplayable after
the stream today um my
meta defining tier list has just come
out
many times in my life i thought i was
good at a video game beat slay the spire
ascension 20 did a tier list of every
card for every character except for the
watcher they weren't in the game at that
point the slay the spire subreddit
mocked me
hey
wow imagine valuing uh strikes over
man defense not understanding the value
of bias cognition
anyway
hi nerds how's it going um
regardless
super auto pets
first tier list
didn't do super well okay
a lot of the duck in the a tier cat in
the f tier what was i thinking what was
i thinking terrible idea this new tier
list
got posted on the sap subreddit most
people were pretty positive about it
some people had criticisms i'm here to
tell you your criticisms are invalid
when you apply the theory in the tier
list
to
sap gameplay
you cannot get under four wins it it
literally doesn't happen i'll show you
right now you cannot get under four wins
it hasn't happened last night i played
four games okay i played four games
eight eight ten ten
it's so simple it's just stats and crabs
man it's just stats crabs meats that's
it
okay
obviously we'll open up the casino with
this in mind
you know place your bets wisely place
your bets wisely i'm not trying to juice
the bets
is inscription canceled or what we
literally
date
we played it yesterday
with like two hours we played it
yesterday don't believe what you saw on
the subreddit somebody on the subreddit
made a post
that was like
hey did nl cancel inscription and then
somebody else made a post that was like
oh in the fall guys twitch rivals he was
mentioning that he beat it so of course
there's going to be some more coming to
youtube soon and i was like source dude
just trust me that [ __ ] did not happen
at all i have not beaten the game i'm
not even out of act one yet
then somebody posted hey can you give me
the time stamp and then they replied
again
um
here's the video i can't seem to find
the time stamp where he says that yes
cause you made that [ __ ] up my man you
made it up
you had a fever dream and imagined i
said something that did not happen
you spend the rest of your life looking
for that damn timestamp it does not
exist
anyway here we go
play arena
it's a great starting shop man it's a
great starting shop
i think you buy an ants
imo
it would be there's two ways you play
this right off the start okay there's
two ways that you play this right off
the start you either guarantee yourself
a 3-2 ant
i don't think that's bad i think it's
pretty good however i would much rather
have a three hp unit so i'm going to
take the 50 50 shot
i'm gonna take i this is not common i
just need your stats sir i just need
your stats
okay it's unfortunate but you still it's
an okay start um
you know what let's be the sniffing
fishes i'm still kind of sniffing today
i did have a perfect win last night by
the way i i don't
i don't feel the need to flex uh
necessarily but uh that [ __ ] uh happened
by the way we win these
i i had a 10 win
no draw no loss ooh baby you're making
me crazy
every time i look around okay so i don't
i don't like pigs but sometimes you know
if you gotta do it you gotta do it
okay you're gonna see something you
don't see too often here okay
i think this could go wrong
but i'm going to do
a pig i'm gonna buy a mosquito
and then i'm gonna add a duck to the
squad
i think a duck is better than an apple
and i definitely do think a duck is
better than a horse here unfortunately
we've had many
unplayable uh animals show up in our
shops
despite the rudeness of that
i'm gonna go ahead and say we
actually you know what we might win
these
no we lose these that's that's fine they
had a nasty static squad
okay it's still not an ideal situation
here step one
you got a couple of possible avenues
okay you sell the duck and then you buy
whatever you feel is the best of these
and then you pill or you pill and hope
it doesn't hit the duck
i think you could maybe think about you
know what here's what i think about this
i think you can sell a duck
to buff a dodo even though a dodo is
kind of doo doo if you know what i mean
um or at least
it's situationally playable let's put it
that way then we're gonna have you get
pilled and you're gonna hit the dodo all
right all right all right i see you
we're not gonna invest in a flamingo
plus pill
we're much more
uh interested ideally in uh finding
ourselves in a situation may happen
we get some pairs but unfortunately that
does not appear to exist this is a
pretty spicy situation here
this is not ideal
we have uh just a a a terrible shop
i would be inclined
jeez louise man i would be inclined to
play a
crab
because i think a crab is like a it's
not great right now but it's like an
auto ad in general
we're gonna buff the dodo ever so
slightly admittedly the crab is not
stealing any hp right now so i think the
way that we're gonna do this
well this is creating a 63
with a three five this is creating a six
three with a three five so literally
it's the same thing we'll just keep it
as is for now this is uh
this is a pretty nasty
situation right here
and and of course we're going up against
the golden poop as well i would predict
a loss here for sure the only thing i
would say and this this oh my god we
actually win these the other thing i
would say is like um
this this may surprise you but i'm still
like pretty confident in the squad here
the math wasn't great there okay let's
let's walk it through then okay
in this situation we have a three five a
six three and a three three in this
situation we have a three five
ah a three five and a six three okay
fair enough whatever we win
bands trunks
um it's like it's 9 14 in the morning
okay
you never have math class period one you
have pe
period one
i think we have to say goodbye to an
otter
i i love it it just hasn't panned out
yet
i will recklessly spend too much gold
here we will roll
that's fine that's not that big of a
deal
you're actually like a piece to be
honest with you um i'm just letting you
know like this is a very
crappy squad we're looking for like um
oh it's a nasty team too um we're
looking for like any pairs and they have
not shown up yet although look at this
crab dude so inspirational
that takes us to three wins one loss
which is kind of incredible given that
this squad is truly horrible
um
i mean i'll be honest with you
i think you can
this this pace i mean you you got to get
rid of a pig at some point too it's a
freaking 3-3 i think you get rid of it
now
which means we're probably going to be
do one in our in our next shop freeze
this because i think the losses are
coming
we can take a second obviously we're
going to rework our positioning here
okay we'll this this is now we're
talking this is now we're talking tier
um give me a swan at the front
get the dodo pop and now we got a monkey
holy bursh
freeze this i mean i actually want to
freeze the whole shop this is now in an
interesting position without a doubt um
i just have to think
we can't sell the crab that's for sure
so we're kind of stuck where we stand i
would roll once
dude
call me crazy
no you know what we're not losing this
round so i'm not worried about that
frees me up here this this is our stat
squad now we just need to scale and i
think we're still a little behind the
scaling but we
we're looking forward to it
okay 13-4 swan gets bodied life goes on
level one horse
this is a win
dude you did
everybody who insulted the crab is gonna
be so upset kate i hope you're watching
like i see you in chat i hope you're
paying attention this is how i get you
know all night i'm like check it out 10
wins 10 wins 10 wins 10 wins
this is how it happens right here and
that we could not have asked for a worse
shop for like our first three rounds to
demonstrate it and yet
nevertheless we persisted
so get owns
penguin is is okay it's a flexible
position it's not what we're going to be
rolling long-term
we will add a a monkey haven't you
always wanted a monkey to the situation
a little swan up at the front garlic on
you is going to slap like a freaking
slapper and then if you look at this
now the dodo is getting more hp which
makes the crab even better we at some
point depending on the way this scales
we may end up rolling crab behind swan
but we got to wait a little bit we just
got to wait a little bit to get it going
hello anonymous
something tells me this is not gonna
work out the way you thought
something tells me this is not gonna
work out the way i thought
okay you got me you got me
it's okay this this is good like i know
how this like it maybe doesn't look like
it's that amazing right now but i
promise he was gonna get there
so you freeze a bunny and i know you're
gonna say what bunny nah man
it's it's real i promise you this
because it looks a little bit like this
you're going to end up selling a fish
rolling a bunny you're going to buy a
salad
we don't mind it too much
um honestly i'll tell you with with
authority we're not going to buy
anything else here we might as well
freeze a cupcake and fish for some stuff
that's even better
you could consider pivoting to a hippo
but i actually don't think it's
necessary
a turtle is also interesting a squirrel
not so much this is exactly what we're
looking for you don't need more crabs
it's a trap
and as much as you might think that the
dodo buff makes the most sense
i think that
the swan scaling faster is actually for
now
our ticket to greatness quite frankly
it's a spicy as a spicy fish hey you
watch the viewer spotted viewer spotted
unfortunately i'm you but stronger
okay so that takes us to five
oh
it's over
like it's actually over um because now
what we do
is we say we really do want some garlic
if we could just get a roll with some
garlic
if we talk about classics does my name
get brought up
because here's what you do you do one of
these here's what they think about
you here's what they think about you
here's what they think about you
i almost put
the second one on
that would have been a little bad but
that's okay here freeze me here's what
they think about you
here's what they think about here's what
they think about you
all right now we can start to think
about putting the crab
behind the swan instead hello viewer
nice to see you
that's six wins
with with the like strangest most
garbage early shop you could ever ask
for
obviously you're leveling
no no no it's not
honestly probably this is like a
z tier we don't respect it anymore
you know we respect we respect a little
bit of that a little bit of this a
little bit of that
started with a kiss it's all in the game
of love we'll freeze one of those we got
capacity we'll freeze one of those now
you got to think what's better
a 3423 garlic armor
with a 1010 behind it or
a 20 23 garlic armor
with a
1923
in front of it i don't know
shut up in pog dummy
we can probably replace the meat with
some garlic i would agree with that
hello viewer
nice to see you
cool hurt build somebody doesn't read
the read the patch notes
anyway get owns um
so that's seven wins
and we're still pogging and we're still
pogging
uh you know what i could be persuaded
here this is a suede-able you'd give me
something like this something like this
don't make me laugh it's trash
okay then we'll just uh
honestly i i bet if we're only gonna
spend three gold i bet we can do better
than an apple
usually we'll freeze one of these just
for we don't need to get to a level
three swan don't make me laugh
don't eat a crab don't make me laugh you
know what i'm mistaken i'm mistaken we
can't do better
than an apple but on the bright side
haven't you always wanted two monkeys
okay now we're talking freeze these up
okay it's a little spicy because of the
level 2 total
your bat has let you down
oh that's nasty you know what you got me
on that one but only just barely
only just barely
i'm still uh i'm a big believer in in
the science of this squad right now
you need one of these
obviously um
we might as well get you going
we might as well get you going
this is a a highly freezable unit
um
i'd rather give you plus eight plus
eight honestly then combine you and buy
a cat right away so i think we'll just
keep it as is right now
and look for
a better food but
yeah okay garlic on the crab if we win
is important actually an apple will do
just fine for us as well
i really believe that we're not going to
lose this upcoming round
their whole squad falls apart when the
hippo gets bodied this is
it's an easy win it's too late for
garlic source dude just trust me unlike
most people um when i get to what nine
wins eight wins i'm not on round 17 i'm
on round 12. we still got room to play
with in my opinion
next thing i would say
imo probably be looking at something
like uh
run round 12 okay give me a level three
give me one of those
toss me one of these real quick now
you're you're you're maxed more or less
why don't you take one of these because
you're gonna get some nice buffs here
roll me
i need better than apple long-term pear
will work just fine you can absolutely
fit a snake behind the crab and then
even if the crab doesn't have attack we
love this in fact
slightly controversial opinion
this is how you get the 10 wins right
there
pass me
it's it's actually we're very lucky we
don't have melon armor yet
get out of here come on you peace as
long as we kill the camel i ain't
sweating it too bad
although i gotta admit our crab is a
little stinky hit the fly hit the fly
hit the fly
hit the fly hit the fly
hit the fly
hit the thing that gets the kill you
peace
what's that nine wins
big whoop
who cares
tell you what probably toss me two of
these
dragon don't make me laugh will your
windows boots up in like a day and a
half
you could back up your your whole hard
drive on a floppy diskette you're the
biggest joke on the internet
oh look it's the same damn squad
this is what happens you get to the end
of the game you exclusively play against
turkey fly dog tiger et cetera et cetera
you just prepare yourself it's this life
this is how it goes
like rem said oh life it's bigger oh
there goes your melon armor uh oh
oh
oh oh we got 10 wins sorry my mistake
uh oh oh i dotted the tier list all crab
in eightier crabbing eight here 90
question marks in a row that makes it
seem like i'm right even though i don't
know what the [ __ ] i'm talking about
there's 10 wins and did you see our
early we were rolling ducks in the early
game
we started with a duck dug
it's just that easy so i mean if you
doubted on that one
let just go ahead sing the chorus of the
doubters the odds were too good sorry
sorry
i couldn't resist those odds sorry okay
that was a good run
run it back man run it back
all right
crabs still not eight here actually it
might actually be s tier quite frankly
it might actually be s tier okay early
shop this is a c
c minus level shop
we're gonna go for a heavy re-roll early
um it is now turned into i would call it
a a straight-up b this is this is a b
shop probably should have made sure that
we buff the fish
whatever let god sort it out
i'll be the sniffing
scallywag because that's what i am right
now
s tier crab just know i'm if you if you
data mine the stats you will be ashamed
of your words and your deeds i
personally we lose these by the way um i
personally guarantee crab has a higher
incidence
of also getting 10 wins
than any of your favorite animals and i
mean that with the utmost sincerity
excuse me
thank you
after you just gonna squeeze right by
you should have moved the mosquito up to
position two but whatever
okay what do we got here
we got a squad that uh i would say it it
scares me a little but not too much
we got a nice squad here
we win these 1-1 i'll take those i'll
take those
now we already oh
here's what they think about you
okay so you can definitely
put a dog on here for stating round
three you can put a dog on here for
stating probably look at something like
this probably look at something like
that give me a nice buff don't make me
laugh your windows boots up in what a
day and a half probably take one of
these real quick for some nice stating
probably take give me a freeze and then
roll me oh
we'll probably just put one of those
right there for the time being got a
quick little four four three four freeze
me and turn if we can get to a level two
dog we got some stuff going on here man
i'm oh
oh no
pay to win background
wait a minute we win these we win these
easily
okay easy money
i like when you drop a couple of ice
cube lines then you drop some weird al
lines at the same time
honestly
ice cube is uh he
i i
you know i say this as somebody who's a
noted ice cube enjoyer not a big fan of
him lately
not a big fan kind of uh as somebody who
has described the weird al is kind of
cringe in the past i'm inclined to say
that you know what weird al has
superseded him on my on my personal tier
list that being said weird al has never
made no vaseline
weird al has also never made um
a song as as ridiculous as dirty mac
uh where ice cube says and i quote dan
carlin's style
there's a new girly on my street and i'm
an introducer to my meat
looking to bend that thing in half hit
her with the shaft take a bath then i'm
out what is he even talking about that
right he's so he's like he's gonna bend
her in half hit her with the shaft then
he's like okay hold on i'm just gonna
use your bathroom for a second
he's gonna soak in there for a little
bit then right after that he says let
her keep the
trojan.
what is he talking about
why would she want to keep the trojan
after that it just doesn't make any
sense
i think after that he says if things go
good still be the girl's friend like
it's just weird just a weird song
anyway um what was i talking about oh
yeah the fourth floor mosquito get out
of here the otter has some potential
upside give me a quick little spawn five
four we'd love to see it oh what did i
tell you what did i tell you nobody
believed me what did i tell you
it's gotta be something i know what
you're thinking
okay so you you keep this going
um we could we could roll a double apple
even though it's not the best fruit in
the game
it's a nice little scaling factor on our
on our doggy here
you can hit me with the question marks
all you want it's it doesn't matter we
win these
easily quite frankly
okay another otter is fantastic
we gotta make space though which is the
tough part so i think we're probably
gonna only use the bunny as like a
temporary thing
probably something like this probably
something like this
then this takes us to six
i'd say we got our money's worth out of
that probably we will um but you know
that wasn't messed up order you gotta
you gotta pop the otter
directly into
the otter otherwise you you get the
lower buff instead of the the upper buff
you peace
you're right that's all i wanted to hear
uh we should not have done this because
now we have double the chance of getting
a 2-2 on our swan
that's okay life goes on excuse me
pardon me coming through now that's
sequencing that's an insidious sequence
right there
a dangerous lick the next step uh garlic
garlic
on the dog
will do some some great work for us i
see you have your own dog here that's
cute no turtles please what a kangaroo i
sleep i sleep and we win these
was that four four already
is it supposed to be hard
okay that's good
that's good
that's good i'll tell you what we'll buy
one of these real quick welcome to the
squad we're looking for a dog ideally
holy
birch okay i wish i could put you in
reserve but you know you can't
this is the squad as it stands right now
i'm very sorry for the bunny but
it's got to be done and if it's got to
be done then it's got to be done do
something like that
honestly of all these sure toss me a
three-five skunk and toss me a bottle mr
jones
when everybody loves you that's just
about as funky as you can be
that's bad for your hp
not so bad for mine
i gotta tell you it's a very clever
squad you got here
if only the rest of your squad did
anything
that badger could have worked
okay i wouldn't i wouldn't plan on using
a hippo anytime soon the skunk is not
long for this world um we'll take one of
these for sure
really otter swan fish
we'd love to see it
monkey is also incredible
i the next thing i would sell would
probably be our otter in order to fit
something else on the squad i honestly i
think i could deal with selling an otter
to run a penguin
which also gives us a nice little summon
buff on you getting very good luck with
the dog right here by the way i will
freeze a bison
i i absolutely love a bison we're only
one fish away or perhaps more likely one
chocolate away
we can roll a second garlic this is like
it's an ideal setup for us honestly okay
i you're lucky i was gonna sell you i'm
not gonna sell you but i was gonna sell
you
i freeze me just in case we got an
incredible shop here
we got an incredible shop here
oh hello viewer
you look i i respect the crab probably
more than anybody else on planet earth
respects the crab
all i'm gonna say is that you need to
get your crab going a little stronger if
you want it to work okay
so that's six wins we're already at the
believer payout
one one chocolate away freezes all the
foods it's because we're not at level
five where chocolate spawns
sticks underscore sv it's because we're
not at level five where the chocolate
spawns
so i freeze it because this is
incredibly high value food and the
chocolate can't even exist yet
explain explain yourself
i just wanted to get an easy joke that
would make people laugh okay well we're
all laughing now
are you ashamed of your words and your
deeds
now without further ado let's get back
to winning um
the swan is great
it doesn't have to exist long term you
can say goodbye
you can summon a second monkey
you can put another well
okay yeah we'll put another penguin out
there for now uh we'll put a little
garlic on you and we'll definitely just
keep you moving until
we run into scorpions
we don't need to worry about uh over
stuffing our front unit oh wow this is
we're lucky man this is a viewer
and it's a viewer that's got some some
freaking nasty gaming going on here
anyway we still win frankly mr shankly
it's a good song track 2 of 1986's
landmark album the queen is dead by the
smiths
that being said i digress so now we are
in scorpion territory but we got lots of
hp to play with
i'm not worried about that too much we
got lots of hp to work with
i do love a crab
i think you could fit a crap even though
it's late a crab needs nothing man a
crab needs nothing
so i think you could definitely
combine two monkeys
roll a crab behind your dog
put a meat on your crab all of a sudden
that's another 8 31 we just added to the
squad
it's a free city free city and uh
i don't know i'm starting to think that
honestly might be a little late for this
bison
not that i'm sweating it we freeze one
of these for later game purposes
and we say that this is this is park
city man
okay you got a strong unit up at the
front you did exactly enough damage and
yet
look at this
here's what they think about you
hmm tough luck all right
2x adjacent damage hey frankly mr
shankly thanks for the the gifted
subscriptions thank you thank you
thinking you probably do something like
this
it's an interesting idea to to level the
penguin
i mean this is a plus two plus two to
everything that would also allow you to
get your bison going but we don't need a
bison look at these stats we don't need
it i think instead you just go straight
into the penguin
to stat up the other two units a little
faster
for now i think we roll once
i was hoping to buy some food i know we
got another monkey there i honestly
don't think we need it i think a level
two monkey when you're on eight wins
with three hp is going to be good enough
how can you do i'm just asking you
honestly how can you look at this run
we're on eight wins in ten rounds and be
like yeah pivot to tiger shark
are you seeing how easily we're running
over these squads
why would you pivot the tiger shark here
like look at this
you didn't even get to fight my fish
you think you can win with all t tier
three tier four i think i can win with
all tier twos
i think i can win with all tier twos
okay now let me think about this because
you could totally roll a scorpion i like
keeping the scorpion around
we're on round 11 i mean a plus two plus
two to these two is fine right but like
i think we can do a little better now
it's you or you
for now let's put you in there the the
scorpion is like uh you know you can
roll the the flex on them pretty easily
i think here we're gonna want something
like that
honestly you could do worse than like a
steak
um
on your on your monkey this is like a
huge just in case you could run a stake
on a crab as well i've been known to do
it quite frankly i feel like if you run
anything on anybody we stand a pretty
good chance of getting our 10th win
right here
okay i see your your shark build nice
snail
um i think that the ox
is level one we might trade
or you might kill me that's also
possible
snake you're doing great work keep it up
just land ooh tough luck
okay another one
all right so there's 10 wins good game
ten wins one loss
this one goes out to all the like and
i'm just i'm not even trying to be like
resentful anymore
it's like
the number of of people i mean to be
honest a lot of the
comments on the tier list from the
people that were watching were like this
is much better um
but some of them were like lol how dare
you put crocodiles so low okay sorry
sorry i i consistently get like eight
nine ten wins i hated your tier list
honestly you're probably bad
[Laughter]
oh man
have you ever gotten 10 wins with no
losses i got 10 wins with no draws last
night
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten ten wins ten rounds
that's not perfect that's diamond
all right we're gonna run it back
start start me a prediction here wait
have i even paid out the the believers
from last time look we're not gonna get
10 wins every single time okay
like legitimately it's on infeasible uh
sometimes we're probably gonna get like
seven or eight it's been known to happen
let's run it back
it's an okay shop that's for sure you
definitely would look at something like
this would love to see a second fish a
mosquito or an otter
it's a tough call i'm gonna i'm gonna
get a little spicy i'm gonna freeze my
ant i'm gonna buy an otter that's how
much i respect it
i'll be the dry mouse
i would like to have a mosquito here i
would not deny this
i would not oh by the way we
draw these you know what it's a good
squad that's a good squad
can't be upset with that something like
this something like this what do i want
to see
an otter a fish an ant
or a mosquito it's quite simple
um out of these you still gotta roll
something and i i would say that sadly
our best option
is probably creating
a 4-5 putting a 2-2 that only costs us
one effectively i like an apple it's
just really hard to get me to buy an
apple
that's unfortunate
it's really hard to get me to buy an
apple man like
we draw these
because they're one ones
two draws is not good but it's not the
end of the world
these are all somewhat not good
technically you combine an amp by a duck
and then try but i i would rather
i would rather do it this way
so this is a cell this is i mean you
already know what's coming right
we're getting a dog on round three
because that's the way you play the game
we're gonna create a level
two ant
which has now created a turtle
i'm gonna sell an otter because i like
the two animals in the shop more
and then i'm going to roll
a turtle
in front of our ants which will also
buff our dog and then i'll put the swan
at the back i'm not saying we got an
easy win here
on this round but i think we got a squad
that that wins nicely
in the future this is a nasty team
honestly
but we trade no we don't because you're
a turtle that makes sense yeah okay we
get you there no we don't get you there
we get you here we win these all right
this just goes to show you like how bad
horses
their squad was so much better than ours
except for the horses
and then you already know what's
happening right like we gotta get rid of
something in order to fit this crab
anything you get rid of is fine i'm
willing to take one roll
because we wanted meat anyway but i did
want to see if we got a pill
it's tough
um i would say temporarily i don't mind
dumping a swan
and we can always pick one up later if
if we deem it apropos
lovely
that would be lovely
one of these
you're gonna get pilled so i'm not gonna
meet you but a meat is a good piece of
equipment we could put that on maybe our
fish for the time being
holy birch okay well it is it's
non-negotiable you gotta you gotta do
something here
i mean i'm willing to i'm willing to
take a stand for a round i'm willing to
sell
you
freeze you buy you five please five yeah
okay i mean i knew you were getting to
five i guess you can't lose that one but
i wanted to make sure you were getting
the five attack or five of five defense
freeze this dog oh baby we're loving it
you could maybe roll pig
as like uh as a dog enabler
hey what the heck i i got ripped off
you owe me one hp we we could lose this
egg
lose might be a bit of a stretch we
could definitely draw this yeah that's a
draw right there
he forgot to freeze the scampi oh no
i forgot to freeze the scampi
okay well give me a combine give me a
bye
give me a combine
i honestly at this point i'm like i see
i'm a simple man i see an ant
i take an ants
i honestly feel like maybe we should
roll something like this roll me one
time please
i think um
honestly you're not gonna see this out
of me too much we're gonna roll a
temporary duck for one ones in the shop
in the future
the squad is not quite there yet we need
we need a monkey really
i get it you found your optimal build
but what about showing some run variety
you don't understand it you said you get
it you clearly don't get it
i don't get sick of winning especially
you go read the comments look at all the
comments from yesterday
what is this tier list i've never seen
this question mark question my question
mark what is he talking about crab in a
tier fly and a tier that's got to be s
plus plus plus
here's what they think about okay sorry
okay we don't really need
a turtle to level but
while we're here sure like why not i
suppose we really just want a pill or an
ants like
your life is determined by whether we
get a a pill or an ant first
well we got a pill um
i think the turtle sticks around for a
minute
well you know what i think okay unfreeze
we shouldn't have kept it frozen for so
long
we need to look at our numbers here and
our numbers tell me something like this
like a quick buy on you is always
helpful
freeze me roll me
garbage tier
buy me buff me love to see it
we're not scaling as fast as i would
like i'm really i'm trying to get to
this this monkey
as soon as possible
i'm not going to say this is bad because
i think that's insanity but
you know it could use a little work
i mean it's also doing
pretty well
three wins no losses but there's a lot
of draws in here
which is the real problem okay honestly
i was gonna peel you man i was gonna
pill you
i'm gonna keep a pill frozen we've
invested a lot into you it's just the
question of like whether or not
we're gonna get you know what we don't
have any better replacement right now
just enjoy being alive
ain't it good to feel alive feel the sun
across your face
okay
i absolutely think
you could roll a scorpion
one of the things i've been trying to
get to pop is like uh a scorpion getting
buffed by a monkey like i have a serious
dream in my life
of
getting a scorpion to like 50 50
because it doesn't i i was under the
mistaken opinion that the scorpion
you're absolutely right this will get
overridden
i was under the mistaken opinion that
the the scorpion
only has death touch on its first attack
but it actually
has it forever so if you can get like a
monkey or two monkeys and then a
scorpion and then just go blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah anything can happen
man it can be a it can it could be a lot
of fun
um but it you got to get the perfect
setup so for now economically we're not
at the right level to do this but that's
fine
uh that's
very huge
that's fine i'm not really i'm a
disbeliever in the can quite frankly
okay maybe it doesn't have to be 50 50.
okay it could be because you're right 50
it won't kill everything but it'll kill
most things by itself as well
but uh
you know even it being like a 30 30.
would be okay
so i think you gotta go first i mean
this is weird because like the turtle
wait okay hold on we have a level three
ant okay now we gotta rethink the way
we're gonna play this
how about
level three ant me i'm not gonna kill
you we'll use you as like an ox enabler
then i'll peel you to get two melon
armors
nice buff thank you bunny
um obviously we'll go like dog
yummy we really need you to get some
more
uh defense i'm telling it i'm just
calling it like i see it right now
this is not a i'm not optimistic about
the idea that this is a 10-win marty
right now
but i certainly think the believers have
nothing to fear
we're just we're not scaling as fast as
i would like
level one turtle so the elephant's gonna
get us but then our crab gets a chance
to shine
you peace
new peace wow
dude that was like really good well done
okay the bunny
we got we got three hp to play with
that's fine the bunny you gotta go
you're just a temporary
flex position anyway we're really
looking for a monkey here please haven't
you always wanted a monkey
uh four hold on
for
three gold we get a summon
that's plus two
statically
thank you then we pill you might get
something good
would have been nice if we bought you
but that's okay
sell it back we got one more buy in play
here you can definitely freeze a little
chocolate
we actually have two more byes in play
if we do it like this
now we're talking then we want to end on
the swan
i respect it
we really need uh
we really need a bison i think would hit
the spot
1631
peacock
pretty spooky and yet there we are
what are you gonna do you see that
hatching chick what the heck was going
on with that man
holy birch
okay we chill this is fine for now i
think we you need the buffs more than
anything else
we don't need a turtle we don't need a
crab
i do kind of need to go to the bathroom
but we'll leave that for the time being
um okay so now we have our level three
this one should go
the the ox i mean the bison should exist
he's gonna scale very slowly
very slowly indeed
so what we would like to see perhaps the
most
um
i mean honestly this
this is a bit
optimistic but we're gonna give it a try
anyway
a little golden poop huh okay so we get
countered by melon armor it's the first
time it's happened this game but it's
not it's not inconceivable this is a
nasty squad man at least it's only a
level one rooster
this is a pretty nasty squad we're
getting into turkey builds here
two four four rams they get buffed this
is a loss you got me just barely
why did you pass the scorpion the
scorpion only gets stats on level up
which you know like a plus one plus one
of the scorpion i kind of sleep
if we can get like you know a monkey
that gives plus two plus two
uh every term by herself but the monkey
doesn't seem to exist on this build for
whatever reason
get one of you going
not quite
imo
i think um
we're reaching a point where maybe we
could just add another scorpion back in
later if we want one this is a nice dog
buff
which also helps us out with the crab
um
controversial well let's make sure you
don't get sniped
this bison is scaling a little slow
a little slow
holy birch
there
it's a viewer
they're rolling the same squad hold on i
think i'm them but stronger lucky us
anyway that's the believer payout
no sweat there
little late for a penguin that gives one
one
the cat is is kind of important on us i
mean like i need to here we
accidentally got ourselves trapped in
quicksand okay
i need to sell the ants nothing else can
be sold really in order to keep buffing
the dog but i can't sell the ant because
the ant is connected to the bison
which means that really we should sell
the bison
but if i sell the bison chat is going to
uh
actually
riot
i think i'm just going to do it
and then we'll see whether we were right
or wrong in time
we have one hp to play with which is not
a lot
but it's not zero it's again we're kind
of in the you know what actually we're
not in the same boat cause check this
out now we can actually sell our ants
although i would like to we can roll a
couple times to see if we get a pill
holy birch but now we can't fit the cow
so
this is our life right now
we're going to
next turn because i love this shop this
turn nobody knows what's gonna happen we
will probably die
what we're going to do next turn is peel
you
buy a cow
feed the dog
feed the dog and get something else
this is our only route in my opinion
our only route to 10 wins
we may lose this round as a result of
that
we shall see
lucky
oh no we're not gonna lose this round by
the way
that takes us to seven
then
it's gonna be this
this
still attack i'm not upset with that
this
yummy yummy
yummy
this
hit the dog please
i don't mind it i don't mind it
oh as easiest freeze of my life
more food please
i love it i love it
i love seeing all the face palms what
are you what are you face palming for
we're actually like the only thing you
should be face palming for right now is
the fact that we're ruining the game
with our like incredible strategy like
you're never going to be able to play
this game again
interesting and an interesting setup oh
nice build nice nice fly
uh dog turkey build nice nice one
okay so that takes us to eight wins
tiger snake fail we
just honestly just boot up the game i
would love some more free wins these
ones are actually stressing me out a
little bit
if you're so eager to like feed me some
free wins just log on like now it's a
good time
um
now we gotta think i honestly i think
you could start
maybe buffing your crab a little bit
because we're already getting buffs
thanks to the milk at least on occasion
straight up i know how this looks but
now we got two cats for our next round
nice melon armor holy
it's it's a tearless viewer they're so
upset with the way that we
we talked about the leopard last time
wow nice leopard anyway we crush you
hmm i'm thinking like
that seems pretty okay
you can roll a uh a scorpion here
parrot is now not cat
how about that i think for now hold on
pop me a scorpion up at the front parrot
you stink you stink
and i don't like you
i don't even want melon on my cat
honestly i think you could probably
start to think about melon on your crab
considering it's going to be a 30 50.
and let's see let's see
okay you know you know what we say about
four bisons we say respect
we respect four bisons
that's just an incredible
play i i bow down to you i bow down to
you with this incredible strategy
you're turning the meta on its head and
you deserve all the respect that you get
okay we are looking for
one thing and one thing only guys only
want one thing and it's disgusting we
want a tiger to put behind our snake
here that's about it
look it is pretty tempting
stats are always nice
but i think for now we're still rolling
for a tiger
we're still rolling for a tiger
still rolling
it was fun while it lasted
okay
oh that's tough luck
oh
okay it's not the the luck was not that
tough we're still popping though dude i
don't know though the scorpion
in front of the
oh
never mind you're toasted hey there's 10
wins again
now he wants the tiger
now he wants the tiger
he didn't take the tiger earlier because
he was using the black cat to scale his
uh creatures to 50 50 and now he wants
it
i am very smart by the way by the way so
that's what three ten wins in a row
anyway that was like the easiest run of
my life uh let's throw in a slash marker
temporarily uh that's sap flawless
endless
i'm going to go to the bathroom



okay i'm letting you know
before you bet
okay before you bet
we are gonna play on the pay-to-win pack
all of my bravado
all of my bluster
because we've got three ten wins in a
row was on the free-to-play pack i
really feel like i got the free-to-play
pack freaking solved man like i i'm not
saying we're gonna get 10 wins every
single time but i think we're gonna get
10 wins or at least like six wins
pretty much every time
pay to win i don't know i'm we're still
working on the meta for pay to win okay
so i'm not trying to massage the bets in
any direction i'm just saying i'm moving
to the pack where i have less
experience less understanding and a
little bit less confidence that's it
that's all i'm saying i don't really
need to know the difference between the
two packs
except one of the packs is uh bat meta
and this pack has caterpillars as well
and puppies and puppies okay
now normally this shop would appeal to
me i don't know since we're on pay to
win maybe yes maybe no
you can definitely roll a mosquito
freezer mosquito you can freeze a beaver
i think the beaver is under respected
um
you know what be an edible herb how
about that
i'm an hour late because i was playing
pets
look i'm not trying to make anybody feel
bad have the worst day of their life etc
etc we draw these by the way
we we draw these by the way um we did
just bust off an hour of 10 wins in a
row
so i would say you've been missing it
bob
okay
you make one two three mosquito
throw out a two three fish
this is the squad we love the squad
hey weary drama dairy
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
holy birch
thank you thank you
much appreciated
we win these again i'm telling you
crickets
dog water tear
this ain't a scampi build
this ain't sea world this is as real as
it gets i'm on a boat
don't you ever forget
he says the f word there i'm not willing
to debase myself to that level
um
this is
okay this is a cell
don't buff my caterpillar you're a piece
quite frankly um
there's a freeze
it's a buy obviously
freeze
dude i don't know if everybody here
follows kate on on twitter
but she uh she tweeted yesterday our
baby started saying bless every time we
sneeze
is very cute
but you know
if you're not familiar with kids like
once they like uh they get something
they just keep saying it over and over
so like every time i sneeze it just
she just goes bless bless bless bless
bless it's it's kind of cute though for
sure i'm a big fan um buff my mosquito
you know
could be worse
uh
what am i doing
put it there give me two bats for the
time being
i believe in the power of this squad
right now
so what i'm gonna say is this is a great
time to re-roll
uh normally i would like a swan i think
by round five it might be a touch late
i regret my words and my deeds um i
think a flamingo and a pill frozen is
like an okay backup plan because we want
our mis basically it's gonna buff
our bat and our mosquito and the
caterpillar will get a buff off of the
mosquito in the future so i think
there's a there's a play there in the
future that's not an ideal set of
rerolls though
this seems okay i mean i i do not fear
the horses and i'll tell you one more
thing i don't really fear the wind or
the sun or the rain
either we could be like they are we win
these
throw some bees on it
all right you could definitely roll a
poodle
which would mean we probably dump our
fish
so it'll be like a combine
poodle
four two one three one
so you're gone yeah maybe if she's five
foot two uh
sold
we don't need to use a flamingo here
what so so we have one two three four so
whatever we roll
from this point onwards is just like in
the flex position for us okay i
understand that so we're gonna we're
gonna pill like this
we're gonna buy
honestly like
for the time being let's put an ant out
here it's got some pill stats for the
future
uh yeah freeze me that's good enough we
really so what we want to do to to round
the squad out here we want a tier
5 unit
and i don't think it matters what it is
if we get it fast enough oh so we ruined
your whale you love to see it
it happens to me from time to time we
win these
and we're gonna if we buy this the
caterpillar will level up next turn
which is a good turn for us to get that
level
i think this is an easy enough
setup for us here we already have a tier
four because it's buffing itself
we'd like to freeze a pill you always
freeze that on the last one like just in
case this is a squad man
this squad is is doing a okay right now
level one bad okay bad difference
i would say no i would say no
um you know what though we actually lose
these fair enough
okay
which is is kind of good
believe it or not because we can kill
you please hit the mosquito
okay so now you're only slightly getting
debuffed we probably do want to can you
but first we'll hit you with one of
these
there's a part of me that's like maybe
you could roll a chicken but you have to
sell something to fit the chicken
enabler which makes no sense to me so i
would say probably no
and this is you're a tier four which
means you're a piece
honestly this turn
just give me a quick dear
we want a turtle to go in front of our
caterpillar i'm not totally sold that
this mosquito is going to scale forever
but
if we had two spaces that would have
been a cool time to roll a chicken i
mean it might have been a cool time to
roll a chicken regardless
i'm not the arbiter of like what works
and doesn't work on uh
on uh pay to win on free to play maybe
i'm pay to win not so much
okay so that takes us to five
we still want a tier five honor you you
gotta fit a bison in here
it's now like
it has to be done so you put a bison
it's it's round eight it's early enough
to do something let's start getting some
equipments
um the poodle will also give us an extra
buff here we like it okay
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no
i'm not rolling two caterpillars just
because i like don't fully believe in
the
that this squad is that close
honestly it's a little
messy but
this one's for the believers
please keep in mind we have a flow chart
right now the um
the bison must be to the left of the
poodle for us to get the buffs we're
looking for these are the buffs we're
looking for all right believers get paid
out
so we're we might be worse to pay to win
but we're still we're still going
i think we got a fish for some better
foods
poodle
scaling us wider or or faster is fine
i still think you could roll a scorpion
we just got to figure out how we would
want to fit it and it's probably like a
late fit
all right well i guess i'll just spend a
sushi's worth of value
rolling past sushi and then buy one
anyway
hmm
i
i fear the squad a little bit but i
think we do pretty well at the back
honestly like i knew that was coming and
then this is
okay you got me fair enough that's a
good squad
honestly snake did some real damage
roll me
roll me
poodle leveling up very nice very nice
indeed
i don't think we can fit a dragon i i
kind of
we're we're locked into the squad right
now but i don't think we're locked into
the squad
in like a negative fashion i actually
feel like pretty okay
all right this is gonna
make people upset but
[Laughter]
there's a method to my madness okay
we want the bison to continue getting
the buffs so that the caterpillar gets
the buffs
wow we got oh weakness doesn't work the
way i thought i did anymore that's okay
we lose these
good there's a nice double monkey
honestly
okay so the next step would be
something has to go
um
and the something is the mosquito
and we need to do that so that our
turtle can come out
we know that the caterpillar is getting
buffed instead of the turtle but there's
nothing you could really do because you
got to put the turtle
to the right of the caterpillar we'll
keep you frozen
perhaps one day
okay so for now
i really think
like the bats amazing but i think we
have to scale the bison
fast enough that it can
survive on its own right that's
important that's important so i don't
know
if this is gonna get us there
i don't know what we're doing with the
bison at the at the back with the chili
pepper on it but
uh oh pay to win background
i i see that they've gone for a scaling
build as well it's just the question of
who scales better and i gotta be honest
i like where i stand thank i'm just
gonna say thanks for the free win
because i think that this is someone who
knows that bats are how you win the game
but just got bored of them and said no
thank you
so i i
am honestly graciously saying thank you
for playing
a different build
as a result
we gotta win
basically just due to you being sick of
the meta which is totally fine i respect
it yeah your checks in the mail
i mean
it's not it's not particularly
impressive but
sure
um
okay
i i do like that the dog has had his
equipment replaced but the real problem
here is the turkey we got no snipers we
got no shooters on this one
how much you doing level two turkey
pretty spooky but at least we're
chunking through two here
i i don't mind our odds here i think
this looks okay it's just the turkey is
like is deadly if if that dog still had
melon armor we'd be we'd be cancelling
christmas right about now but otherwise
we're looking pretty good
and now i can't get a single win please
help me
so i'm going to say two things the first
thing i'm going to say is the tier list
is always there to help you if you need
it
we've proven today it's it's doing some
great work
the second thing i would say is
that this is a like
the game is in a ruthless position right
now if you're new to the game
i feel for you in a huge way because
like
this this is not the super auto pets i
grew up with where you could roll like
whatever you wanted just because the
animals look cute and still have a
chance let's go that's huge
still have a chance to get some wins
like we're this the new super auto pets
is a damn nightmare like it's cutthroat
man
the game is being mathematically
optimized by people with undergraduate
degrees in bachelor a bachelor's degrees
in biology
it's disastrous
okay
so we we're going for 10 wins
it could happen
um the t-rex is just too late although
admittedly hold on no
it's not worth the price for the pivot i
think we could do a little better
now we'll probably not do a little
better and just roll endlessly but
i'm not buying an apple on turn 14. you
got to be stupid
i guess instead i'll just roll till i
get uh nothing you know i actually like
a cupcake here because we're in like win
now territory
sure okay
let god sort it out
a lot of high stats but the team doesn't
really scare me that much like
the actual like
squad looks kind of doo-doo
you're so freaking lucky dude
we win these all right so that's ten
wins
what is that four in a row
[Laughter]
we'll pay out the believers on that one
all right we're gonna we're gonna start
a prediction up again
i i don't know what to say it's just
it's been happening you know that's my
new high streak by the way
that's my new high streak
we prefer an ant
freezer mosquito this is a good shop
this is like an a minus start
something about the eager tea bags just
it has a nice kind of lilt to it
this is this is nasty
we lose these i mean that's just a
that's a great team i guess you had
fish two otters
i'm gonna put that in my
i'm gonna put that in my theory crafting
collection
oh yeah do you think they had duck
duck otter fish that could work too
duck otter fish
look i'm i'm open to the idea that i'm
wrong about ducks i'm not but i'm open
to the idea
that i'm wrong we win these by the way
oh the otter at half a level okay
that explains it
no disrespect by the way no disrespect
um we'll start with our mosquito
i actually like a bunny early for stats
if i buy we're on four combine okay i
like this we're gonna buy
we're gonna combine
sheep is good but it's not part of my
current methodology
we will combine these next turn
ideally i think we want the two one at
the front
and we will freeze an apple we just got
to figure out what unit's getting
started right here
i i've got to be honest with you my
methodology is very oh this is a little
spicy man we probably lose this
we draw this lucky lucky lucky um
we uh
we have to rework my entire methodology
now that we have no
uh crabs in the ecosystem like this this
changes the game drastically
look i think you can freeze it as like
if you've got no other options you could
try it and i think that we might be at
that no other options level so sure
you peace
man because of that flamingo we trade
that's like so deadly this kangaroo is
gonna go wild on me
holy birch yeah that's that's a nasty
squad man
okay this i mean this is the most
dangerous start we've been in for a bit
here
i think you gotta make a decision let's
sell this for the time being
roll a second rabbit
and then we must choose something to
buff and it's right now i think you
gotta go with the hot hands
too late for a dog in my opinion
okay that's a nasty ant
honestly i think you can freeze that
maybe you freeze this too
things are about to get very strange
we want to see no bats please no bats i
see no bats oh how direct did you get a
freaking uh how'd you get a poodle so
early man
holy birsh pog city that was a nasty
squad we barely won
but we did win
and then you're gonna laugh at me
and maybe i deserve to be
mocked i think
we're gonna continue rolling three for
the time being
i know the risks
that's unfortunate
freeze me
okay
as as spicy as this looks next turn we
combine we vault a tear
um it's going to be real hard to get
through that dog with the turtle
and also everything in advance of the
turtle as well
[Laughter]
yes that's pretty nasty that's a loss
okay now we gotta now we gotta be a
serious gamer okay
we're not running a meme build just to
run a meme build for the time being by
the way this is just how this shook out
some garlic would really hit the spot
a microbe
no thank you we're kind of equipment
focused right now
um
i think we have an obligation to try
a squirrel to get garlic
thanks for nothing
squirrel really showing his whole ass
there
nice dirty rat just kidding it doesn't
exist
this is what i was hoping but this is
more along the lines of what i expected
okay so that takes us to three keep it
moving
just keep it moving okay
quick sell into a buy
into a buy
honestly into a buy
now you're going to laugh at this one
but necessity is the mother of invention
into
i was going to do cell beaver but you
know what i've decided that that's not
the way this is not the way
okay we gotta at least take a look at
these i believe in my aunt for the time
being a 1427 ant with meat
you're a piece you peace you oh my god
oh my oh my god
oh my god
okay pay out the doubters you got to
respect it you know the the scorpion
it did some incredible work there we got
three wins
start my prediction over again if we got
a hard counter by the scorpion we got
red
you gotta respect it this well done well
done it's what keeps the game
interesting okay
a fish and a mosquito we do like this
we do like this i would roll two fish
freeze a mosquito
milky arms
like the first day of
summer vacation
late may early june
arms do be looking kind of milky we win
these
sorry doodle noodles
i think we
we like it
we like it we freeze it
you you almost had me green ladybug you
almost had me instead we're gonna buy an
ants
i think what happened last time
the ant is not
the unit you want to scale now we kind
of just fell into it like i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna hold myself too
responsible but
you really want that ant to be pillable
at some point you don't want it to be
well i mean i have gotten 10 wins with
an ant before but
it's not your your long term solution
most of the time
we can definitely slot a blowfish into
the ecosystem
this is a really good start
is a really good start we want to put
you here
and probably toss some meat on somebody
this is a very difficult run to see us
losing on turn three like a 9
11 blowfish
that could have gotten the ant buff as
well i mean this is like
palpatine-esque
i don't think we try to level up our ant
quite frankly
i think we do super well i mean garlic's
great on the blowfish but i think we can
also just give it some meat early and
say like that's good enough
i don't really want to keep our mosquito
going we gotta we gotta figure out what
we're doing here it starts with a pill
how did it end up like this it was only
a piss it was only a piss okay so it
looks probably we oh you're not a
flamingo but whatever
that's lucky we like it
um
why why not
because someone said why not meet the
chick so i'm gonna tell you i think a
lot of people when they first start
playing the game we'll make this a clip
this is a teachable moment
they think that what they should do is
put meat on a unit so that the
unit's not so shitty but because meat
applies to every single attack that you
do it makes way more sense to apply it
to something that has a lot of hp which
is why it does so well on crabs
um that have like you know 20 hp if you
put it on this you effectively have a
six one that can't help but die
uh on its first hit
if you put it on this now we have uh
i mean it's not even an 11
7 it's actually an 11 12 that becomes a
16 12.
so you get to use the meat more often
essentially that's that's the long and
short of it 11 damage can be overkill
though
oh no well anyway
i i didn't realize that we were playing
uh inscription
hold on we actually will probably lose
this
if only you had the meat on the chick it
would have gotten you
for now we're likely to keep this
rolling
so i'm actually gonna
i'm gonna peel you
i don't really want you to be a level
two is the problem
we need something gaining stats
permanently but it's not late for a dog
but
it's too late for a puppy i would
consider a dog i don't know
although we do have two things i would
not mind selling
you know okay i'm gonna i'm gonna make
an executive decision i'm gonna try it
even though it's it's quite late in the
system
and then that gives me some
justification to try something like this
i'm putting a lot of a lot of faith in
in this blowfish up at the front okay
and that's a big pivot
early but we have a 12 13 meted blowfish
right now
lovely
lovely
and it's early man it's like uh
it's round five so i'm not sweating it
okay you know what you could you could
persuade me
let's get that permanent plus two plus
two it will benefit our caterpillar
there is a part of me now that's like
i think you
in order to make this run work
there's two ways you can do it you can
sell the dog to buy a buffalo
and then you have this open capacity
space or alternatively you can sell the
blowfish and then try to level them both
i think we got to keep you around you're
like you're winning us runs
and then we're going to throw you to the
dogs this is like what the las vegas
golden knights did to marc-andre fleury
they're like hey thanks for getting us
to the cup finals you piece now uh we're
gonna stab a sword through the back of
your jersey
so once we lose in the stanley cup
finals we're gonna dump you but we need
to keep you for now otherwise we'll be a
lottery team so
goodbye
hello
we'll want you in the future but perhaps
not yet
what do i want to keep
straight up i'm like chili's
a dromedary we don't really want um
because
we need a flex position so it
stuff in the shop in on the next turn
being buffed is irrelevant for us
i suppose we can make do with that for
the time being
sure
caterpillar's gonna level next turn
you're okay i like where your head's at
what if we started getting
uh our buffalo scaling with the chick
instead of the blowfish i i respect it i
believe in it i think you are correct i
think it's an apt decision
we draw these that's a good draw
funny
i hate to say you just gotta go like
as much as i love you it's time for you
to leave you don't have to go home but
you can't stay here
oh
i know
who i wanna take me home
um maybe
one thing's for certain two things for
sure
ah we'll live with it uh we certainly
can do with that freeze me
we have to consider what we're gonna do
a level three
hatching chick is interesting i think
it's a little overrated but i certainly
do consider it interesting
you're so freaking lucky oh my god
you're so lucky you don't even
realize it whatever we won
we might not take you to level three i
gotta think okay i think we look
something like this thanks for the buff
selmy thanks for the buff
that's still okay
now we can freeze this roll this for the
time being
this is what we in the business call a
slow pivot
this would be a nice level next turn
actually
freeze me
this squad's got some stuff going on man
what tier did you place hatching chicks
i think i put them uh oh that's just
nasty man that's just what you've done
to me here is just nasty
i think i put them in the uh in the
eights here because like the one
like a level one buy on them is so
strong
we can wait one more turn here looks
like this
this
this
this
i guess we don't need this caterpillar
if we're gonna do it this way i i like
it better this way because it
it feeds the stats so easily
or just better i guess is probably the
word that makes the most sense hold on
you're a tier four
right now the poodle doesn't
fit me
because
we really only care about this unit in
this unit and we're getting kind of late
in the game i think it's
although i res you know what i'm gonna
keep it in principle
but in practice i don't believe that
it's gonna do it for us but that's okay
this caterpillar coming out is is
basically our win or lose condition this
is the worst uh squad i think i've ever
seen at this stage of the game
this might genuinely be
it's it's staggering that you made it to
this point no disrespect intended but
that was like lit literally just
so like all the same squad like or like
all
level one
units with no stats on them like they
were so bad
i'm sorry to say it but like
it's really bad man
okay okay
um
level three otter though yeah it's but
it's like they got a level three otter
and then they were like
you know
they were relying on the otter to send
them but
okay i'm just i'm just thinking
the pair is pretty good in general there
is a part of me that's like what if you
could start feeding a worm i don't think
we're gonna need it if we have
two strong units we need a turtle to
replace our cow maybe so start me here
that's a nice buff
would have been nice to know that level
two worm was coming we probably could
have tried it but
i think you can pretty much always run a
bat
now we might still sell it to fit
something else so i honestly feel like
running a scorpion early
does better
plus we get the double buff here the
only thing we hate to see is melon armor
but i i honestly think that
one thing that's been screwing me is is
people actually putting scorpions uh
interesting so our scorpion was not high
value there i'm not totally sure i'm
scared of this squad though
um
at all really uh the uh
if you put a scorpion first often times
people will roll melon armor as a way to
be like you know just in case you got a
scorpion this counters it when people
roll a scorpion second that's where like
it kind of blows your mind
now this is not gonna make me the most
popular streamer on the platform
a level two chick does run the risk of
getting an octopus leveled up but we're
at seven wins two hp round 11.
i'm not fully sold on it
it does get to be a 1616
but it will be funny you know what we've
already paid out the believers
why not that's that's a good way to
think about it so you again marc-andre
fleury thanks for your support so far i
really respect and appreciate you
um now get out of here
that's nice that's a nice freeze we're
not gonna buy it yet we can wait one
round
that's a nice you know what
maybe we can maybe we can do something
here maybe we can do something here
we have ideally a win or a draw here
would be very nice
level too bad
it hit the best units it could possibly
hit
hmm
i think we i think we draw these
yeah i can take a draw
i was hoping to spit out another octopus
but that's okay
honestly i i should just buy it early
give us more chance for chocolate in the
future
come on you peace
you a piece
where's my chocolate sorry one more one
more round and then a chocolate or an
octopus
this squad doesn't scare me too much i
mean a tiger level 2 horse is kind of
interesting but
i'm not overly perturbed again like who
cares about attack
all right nice win
takes us to eight
i would like to see some chocolate
please
i mean it's tough right because i really
want the turtle like the turtle is run
winning but on the other hand
whatever chocolate's so much more
important than a pear don't don't
don't deviate this is one of the rare
times where like a tunnel vision
is totally fine please
please
whatever we'll get it next turn
like by definition it's nice that we get
it to go anyway i don't know let's just
give you one of these sure hey there's a
literal chance our scorpion lives if it
fights a 1-1 deer
all right well
this doesn't seem so bad this is a
viewer for sure you can anytime if you
want to be diagnosed as a viewer just
roll a crab build it's that simple
you may not be a viewer but i will
accuse you nonetheless
all right now
basically
we just want a tiger
i don't care what i get unless it's a
tiger can you even get a tiger on pay to
win
do tigers exist on pay to win yes okay
well then i'm i'm exclusively rolling
for a tiger
or another octopus
i'm not rolling micro man i mean you
know what a turtle would work now
because we can sell our hatching chick
but
i don't i don't care for that i want to
see a tiger
i want to see a tiger baby
we can roll once more in fact we can
roll many times more
you know we could actually do we could
get down to zero
sell our level three hatching chick and
then roll a level one hatching chick
instead
okay but actually the honest opinion is
that a turtle is just better um
i don't know i i really still doubt that
this is actually gonna do
anything at all really
we'd we want the octopus to purge all of
the melon armor maybe it won't kill
right off the bat maybe it will
then the scorpion will have no melon
armor to deal with
and then bison and turtle butterfly
does some incredible stuff
there goes your melons i don't even know
if you had any
whatever oh no my turtle that's ten wins
man
i can't believe we made it happen
the the octopus worked i don't know if
we needed it but it was still fun
regardless and we got time to run one
more back
just one more quick one okay one more
very quick one
see you on the leaderboards i was not
look i know how it sounded yesterday it
sounded full of bluster it sounded full
of bravado
i was i was saying ridiculous things
like i've invented the question mark
honestly you you can
i keep my shooters in the back
give me a mosquito um
but i uh you know what i'll be the
gasping streamers uh
i gotta say like i i genuinely think i
might be one of the
best players
on the leaderboards of super auto pets
right now
i can't guarantee it i'm just saying
like
we lose these holy crap
we we've been losing early on pay to win
like i've been i think we've been kind
of pog lately we've been kind of pogging
i make outrageous claims like i invented
the question mark
ants win matches early but
i sleep
nobody's been paid out yet
i think i've been lied to
uh i believe you have been paid out and
you are misrepresenting it for monetary
gain
there's our win
that's exactly true i i would not be
caught dead
resetting either
that don't happen you can absolutely
roll a turtle
buy the turtle first
you can absolutely roll a puppy
now we're gonna have to roll a four
squad marty for a minute here but that's
okay
because you got to keep two gold okay
yeah yeah
early puppy kind of nutty
yeah yeah give me one
although
give me one
no i gotta be straight up with you i
think double me can do some stuff but
let's save one for now
i'm not sure about round two four squad
marty economy's a little bit screwed up
uh excuse me i killed your mosquito
as a result your mosquitoes should not
have had the chance to shoot
oh we win these actually
roll
me i'm not buying meat yet
um
i think we freeze you i know i said we
were gonna do something with you but
just give me i don't respect any of
these animals we need something a little
better
straight up for now i'm like fine toss
me toss me a mosquito we got to stay at
the right amount here i think a melon
armor on our puppy will will serve us
well in the future
spider pill tell me you average four
wins without telling me you average four
wins
oh wait you already did when you said
spider pill
we win these
imo you give me something like this
we know you're gonna be a 7-7
we can spend seven gold and we need to
fill two spaces
i think you freeze one ant because it's
a nice like just in case
honestly
this is a little goofy
it's actually like a lot goofy but with
the melon armor
i'm gonna do something you ain't ever
seen before
you know this we're hoping for a draw or
better on this one oh my god look at
this golden poop man
there's no way like you're you're
punching through this this blowfish
that's just a nasty squad that's a nasty
squad
don't use my tier list against me
okay this is a cell it's a cell it's a
bi puppy's still pogging i'm not so okay
hold on this is that five
yummy yummy yummy
freeze me roll me
originally i was going to play two bats
now i don't think that's the case any
longer i think we'll do something like
this we'll leave you sticking around
because we want to stay on two gold
those permanent statistics pretty good
1511 melon armor puppy round six i will
say garlic will be better on the puppy
right now but whatever
what are you gonna do
would you piece
skunk goat tear goat tear skunk whatever
we win
i almost sold the bat by accident that
would have been pretty nasty give me one
of those
give me one of these we can buy one more
thing a snail is very not a snail a worm
is very interesting
it's very interesting indeed a worm
but i say no to this because
two bats is good for this for the time
being
try something like that instead just to
get some value and hey look now we got a
two-force nail next turn
early-ish worm for now i'm like
i don't see it i could be wrong i don't
see it
who are playing with they worm exactly
man exactly who are playing with they
worm
the great minds of history have oh thank
you double bats
have been asking themselves the same
question
wow that's just terrible luck
we lose these
but it's okay
one life very scary
very scary indeed
however
i'm not rolling a microbe you peace
we're going mighty dangerous here
27 22 i'm telling you garlic would be so
much better than
than freaking
melon right now but whatever melon is is
the way of the future
we're so lucky this kangaroo dies to us
ergo allowing us to win
that's five wins
other man it's tempting the idea of
trying like a micro behind a puppy but
i don't know man what do you think
look freeze me for a second
i promised
i like that this has the chance to purge
melon armor even though its stats are
like a little worse
you gotta think okay just let me think
for a second
um
okay this is but it's plus four plus
yeah we don't need a hatching chick for
that
okay i think we roll once and and stay
is good it's good honestly like if we're
gonna have any chance to win we might
need a caterpillar like like to win 10
games
probably should roll ant in front of the
puppy but please please oh what
we can weaken the puppy i needed you to
weaken the puppy
no no no no no we lose these i mean
that's just a beautiful team
five wins right on the borderline
pay out the doubters



everybody
welcome back we've been doing some great
stuff it's kind of like unbelievable
um
today on stream i'm not gonna say we
never paid out the doubters but we
busted out a four
streak of ten wins and really i think
the only we had three easy 10 spots in a
row on free to play
i switched to pay to win got a 10 spot
and then lost my way a little bit but
you know what i'm happy to be on pay to
win because i feel like we're uh
we're learning a little bit about how to
play the game like free to play i feel
like i got in a great spot right now if
they launch like a tournament i feel
somewhat comfortable um
pay to win
we're still figuring it out man we're
still figuring it out i think we can
totally roll this i don't mind freezing
a mosquito i mean come on
how could you not don't demonetize me
okay you demonetize me you demonize me
i don't respect it hold on we draw these
we draw these
that's fine i accept the draw here they
got a good good optics for the future by
the way
that that build could could do some
damage
holy okay okay
early levels
i'll be the first to tell you i think i
underrated early levels early in my life
um because i oh kill some ants please
kill some ants you peace um
i think that they're actually kind of
sick
and maybe even sick nasty someone could
say because they really open up the
possibility of getting the bison to pop
which if you get one early enough i
don't even know if it's in the the pay
to win build but if you get one early
enough it's kind of sick man it's kind
of sick
i just want you you have to roll a puppy
early it's
in my opinion you can't you don't even
negotiate on this one the scaling is
just out of control i think you get
ready to pop you next turn
we need to keep two gold or more
which is fine freeze this we'd love to
make this space in the future dude
honestly you could possibly consider
rolling a dog
and roll one more time
yeah there's there's something to this
all canine squad maybe i don't know it's
hard to feed two scaling engines at the
same time but
i've been wrong before i'm very scared i
mean scared is not the right word we
will not defeat this eight nine fish
this is a golden poop gamer who has not
just played a lot they're good
that's that's a nasty team maybe some
otters uh buff that fish quite nicely is
i'm not hayden that's disrespectable
you get killed
well you hate to see it
welcome to the squad
welcome to the squad
we need to keep some gold
we can combine these next turn i feel
okay about that
meat will do wonders for us here
you should not be here like
this is not a squad that i'm immediately
confident in but that's okay because
we're learning
like this is the i'm learning
pay to win let's go that's insane
you're cracked
i'm learning pay to win as we speak okay
i don't know if it's as consistent as
the strats that i had rolling in free to
play it's going to take us a little bit
longer to get to
a solved status
not that relevant it's a nice buy
yummy
is a very good buy
i think we're looking at rolling once
getting to three gold
selling our level two mosquito that we
just leveled up
why source dude just trust me uh and
then rolling something
like i think a fish to freeze is fine
uh
actually i think on straight up
okay this time
i'm gonna believe that we're gonna win
here okay
we stay on two gold which is where we
want to be for scaling purposes
we're gonna sell the owl for a buff next
time we're gonna buy the fish get the
buff on the dog combine the fish to get
close to a level three this is just rude
this is just a rude team right here
[Laughter]
uh yeah yeah this is not good that's a
nasty team man i mean that's like this
proving the power of the otter quite
frankly um but and then we're gonna roll
the hatching chick for for some wins
because we need the wind farm right now
it's unfortunate
um
looks something like this
combined
looks something like this
combine looks something like this
we end turn we really need garlic more
than anything else
like this this squad is not that bad
like our squad is not that bad we're
kind of running up against it like
i feel like we're kind of fighting some
nightmare teams
level three horse holy crap that means
our dog is gonna get uh traded for here
which is not a good deal some might call
it the worst trade deal in the history
of deals
and we're on one life now so like i said
i was playing really well earlier today
well i
i actually think this squad is okay
i think it's just kind of like
like we're running up against some some
truly great teams it's possible some
might even say likely
that my own tier list is to blame
you hate to see it
nevertheless
okay well in this case originally i was
gonna get a pear but
come on this time you and i you know as
well as i do
we can think about a poodle and garlic
in the future but this
come on if a 1919 puppy can't get you
your third win like the meta is is
freaking cracked
it's gone too far
not bad we lose to the rat
we trade
we win these thanks for the rat peter
pitt
pitter patter
okay
poodle would hit you
not you
that's scary that's a tough one to roll
then it would hit you
and you because we dump a hatching chick
yeah i think we can still do
it and we the fish does not have to live
too long
we want to make sure the dog's getting
buffed instead of the bat it's just more
important the fish doesn't have to live
for too much longer so like i'm not too
worried about that
out of these i think you just go for the
heavy buff here
and we just need you to be to the left
of the bat
something like that maybe
i don't think this is a squad that gets
us to eight wins but i think i would if
we don't at least get to four then i'm
gonna look at this like
this was a missed opportunity or perhaps
a better way to think about it is that
it's just you know it's a learning
lesson because like this is
these are some serious we we've invested
in our team early on here i'm a little
surprised quite frankly okay okay
as surprised as i am
i mean for three gold
you can do that
is it possible
that this squad can get you there
if you're willing to sell a poodle
and a fish
look at this point
we gotta aim for the fences
nice buy
uh sure start here start here
is this doing something
is this thing on
freeze me just in case
it's really hard for me to pick a
caterpillar up this late but two
caterpillars maybe
um
the the dragon synergy and the dog
synergy
work well together the puppy synergy
runs antithetical unfortunately but
that's just life man that's just life in
this in this cold world
this certainly seems like it's okay so
we're doing very wide scaling right now
so the whole squad comes up at the same
time
um it's a cell
you gotta start here like it's still
it's that precious
you kind of gotta freeze you
i'm giving it a chance okay i'm not
saying that it's gonna get there
but what are we we don't have space for
a dragon now no we do have space for a
dragon you just have to dump your bat
or your or your dog either i mean
it's probably right to buff the or to to
dump the uh the dog but it just feels
wrong
oh you piece it doesn't matter we're
going down so that was five wins i i
think we could have done better but i
also i genuine in my heart i would tell
you like i call it like i see it okay
i think we for real
ran into some nightmare squads like some
serious top-tier gamer squads i actually
am kind of let's go unintended soup like
oops i made soup
that's kind of a weird thing to think
about huh
i just think they're neat
um
i think honestly we were kind of blessed
to break even or do slightly better than
break even there
those were some 2000 elo games
um i do i respect the mosquito i do
it i like it just as ants or horse
hedging
and you know this is a pretty good squad
admittedly if you think your squad is
gonna win i think you can roll the
bluebird i'm not confident uh taking
that chance that's literally like the
prophecy is fulfilled
we still draw these but
that's okay
we might have lost word not for the the
one in five sniper one and four snipe
i gotta experiment with the idea of um
come on are you are you joking
i gotta experiment with the idea of um
more big units at the cost of total unit
um
capacity
like honestly let's be real you don't
you don't need to exist here anymore
what i mean by that statement let's not
freeze the ant let's freeze the pill
instead i i'm not confident in this
squad but bad is good and swan is upside
we got two things close to leveling we
really tried it just didn't work out too
well 66 mosquito kind of nasty kind of
freaky nasty
yeah i don't see how we would
make this work we needed weakness on the
mosquito but you can't really be mad at
your bat
whoops what have i done um okay
you gotta go
totally fine
two bats is acceptable
we got a fish is exactly what we're
looking for you could combine and get
plus one plus one on something else
i don't really think it's relevant i
want to see what kind of creature we get
i think a puppy is really good but
i think for the time being we have to
say that it's probably not the way to go
and we're gonna we're gonna invest maybe
this is what we need to invest in you
know the philosophy that worked for us
on free to play
was basically like go hard for those
early wins and this i mean this is a
hard investment in some early wins
two bats giving us some great weakness
and then a a bloated goose with some
meat on it all of a sudden we got two
dubs
life comes at you fast if you were
trying to dub up a little bit further
here you would probably sell your fish
now
i wish we got a buff out of that but
that's you know what i'm going to try it
anyway just hook me up
we we accepted and i really like that at
some point these can be combined i would
rather wait
until we have a
oh you know what freeze me freeze me i
was gonna say i'd rather wait until we
have like
a third one and i think that's still
true i think you're gonna freeze me
which means you're not doing anything
right now
like you do do a little better with
garlic honestly even though i just gave
you meat
you know what
we could have gotten one extra hp on you
via the rabbit but i think the the right
time to pivot from a mistake is as early
as possible rather than waiting for it
to actually cost you something let's
consider that a big positive here two
two level two horse okay the ox is
annoying we're gonna trade with the ox
then how the heck are we gonna kill this
oh never mind i'm stupid we're just
gonna kill the elephant you killed your
own giraffe because it was weak oh no
that sucks
oh man
wake up honey new tech just dropped
roll me once i'm really looking for
something to fit the bill here man um
okay we need that we need to scale
something right
and one of the ways that you can scale
is by getting like insanely lucky
selling an owl and having it buff your
swan okay the bat is still usable we're
not disappointed to see it
buy a rabbit freeze me this is this is
for scaling potential hp scaling is
worth a lot
now this is like an apple's not really
what you want but at least it is a
targeted plus one plus two
i wouldn't mind getting our hatching
chick to level two and then getting a
caterpillar that can play off of our
swan but
this person they they're they're rocking
our meta
double bunny meta look it's not gonna
work for you on this round but don't
throw the baby out with the bathwater
okay
she wasn't even close so there's wind
number four
now this is you could definitely start
to think about a poodle
you could buff your hatching chick
swan
and bat and poodle
hold on one three two
yeah you'd buff the bat instead of the
swan though
right now the swan is kind of is meaty
it's well liked
freeze me for a moment
you don't have to make immediate
decisions in this game
i just don't know what we're gonna do
with a rooster we got one more cell in
us that allows you to do that
then allows you to do uh you know what
we should buy salad
yummy yummy
poodle
we would like the swan to get buffed i
hate to do this to our poodle but
the swan needs the buff
or i hate to do this to our bad i should
say the swan needs the buff the bat does
so well just by existing
let's see some weakness on our uh
you piece
timing
but that crab is going to run wild on us
dude the crab meta is really good but
hey that's not fair they're running free
to play against pay to win where's
where's the where's the sense of
fairness there
really makes you think
so we're just gonna keep this in our
shop forever apparently um
scorpion is is definitely
runnable up at the front here
where we have a four three two two okay
so the bat's not getting buffed which is
totally fine you continue getting buffed
i know there's a caterpillar in our life
at some point there it is
freeze this as well
this would be an insanely good round to
not lose and i'm still i'm watching you
because the caterpillar
is gonna get a permanent buff off of
whichever of our units is the strongest
is honestly just a cracked ants like
that's it's just good gameplay we got
lucky with our trades here we still lose
this one honestly that's that's a nasty
squad
i feel like um i'm i'm getting to the
point where i'm like comfortable making
a a statement
and my statement is
that actually
the free-to-play deck is cracked versus
the pay to win deck
you got to remember
we started calling it pay to win as a
joke
it isn't like
it isn't like it's guaranteed pay to win
right like we we made that well i
shouldn't say we made it up as if we're
like the only piece people who have ever
made that joke
um maybe the other way to think of it is
maybe my free to play strategy doesn't
work as well
uh
versus the the
as pay to win versus free to play but
that would require me to have some
self-reflection
let's not worry about that that takes us
to five we're at least doing better than
breaking even
i was gonna level up the hatching chick
but actually i think the poodle scaling
is
much more mission critical
we still get to get the caterpillar
leveled faster which is worth a lot and
then
quick little salad eating
we'd like to move this around so we
could buff the
hatching chick instead of the
caterpillar but
okay a little spooky a little spooky
it's not as spooky but
okay that takes us to six so i'm
starting to feel a little bit better
t-rex is insane
probably better than i mean it's better
than a hatching chick if you if you're
confident in rolling
both of these
after all that
we're gonna try
well we could really use some equipment
like i i don't know how effective that's
gonna be
but i'm gonna try it
we keep we we have to keep excess gold
by the way in case you've forgotten um
because that's how our t-rex scales hey
we oh we don't kill the crab
would have been nice though
dirty red
the heck's happening here
we live oh man
we don't live we live level one bus
level one level one bus fly we don't
sweat it too bad
this went fine that that cool kid squad
is gonna be pretty nasty later but we we
fought it at a time that wasn't so bad
for us level too bad is freaking cracked
obviously
um
straight up
i mean i don't mind freezing you but
we're really really
looking hard for a caterpillar
or a chocolate bar
it had to happen there and it didn't so
i'm gonna we're just gonna invest in our
oh but that took away our buff
i did they need to institute a warning
that's like warning you're about to make
your t-rex useless
lucky
oh we needed that double trade man
that's that's dangerous that's
deleterious we draw these we're still
going video's not over yet sweetie don't
go to bed sweetie the video's not over
yet okay caterpillars popping might as
well start working on you
i think we're now at the point where you
say poodle
thanks for your support but no thanks
for your support and now we can start to
roll a squad like this i wouldn't mind
dumping a scorpion for a turtle
i'm going i'm going hard on this bat
here
it it really has to be a turtle
and you we're late enough in the game
i'd much rather have some melon than
some garlic i think
please please please just th this squad
is floundering a little but it has it
has a chance that's this is nice holy
crap they're so freaking scaled man are
you seeing this how did you get so
scaled
i'm not mad though okay we we should
probably run one back super quick let's
run one more back okay
so we've been doing okay but there's
there's more juice to be squeezed here i
really i like a beaver honestly for
stats but
be the uh motherly hands
we got a five and a seven
so we're already twelve eight
yeah maybe if she's five foot two
i don't know what i'm talking about
thanks for the win you love going up
against horses and ducks early that's i
i don't mean to be crass but it's like a
guaranteed win
freeze me roll me
yeah okay
freeze me i like it i like this squad i
we should have combined two fish and
rolled two mosquitoes but
alas
actual impact of like plus or minus five
percent on the run but it is a bad play
we're playing a little too a little too
quick here
but that's because
very soon i should uh pick up my
daughter from daycare we're not
overrunning the time do not fear
i'm just we gotta plan to go a little
faster here by the way we draw these and
i'm happy to do so
lots of level up opportunities here
you know what's gonna happen
if you can wait a turn
you can pill the ant instead of selling
it here for a meaningless level up
i might not get the people super popping
and this round is more likely to be a
loss as a result but i think it sets us
up better long term holy crap three nine
bat please bat me
bad difference you just got bad at sun
okay we win those bat difference also
your spider sucked don't care didn't ask
ratio plus your spiders trash
um hit me
that's okay
two two hits the same on everybody
except this is a unit that's gonna stick
around a little longer anyway okay we
don't sweat that uh honestly buy me and
we'll probably combine but just wait one
second holy bursh
uh i just realized we don't have the
gold to do what i wanted to do so let's
hold this
actually this is good because then we'll
get a another unit leveled up
yeah yeah yeah we'll get another unit
leveled up as a result of this
on uh turn five which is a better turn
to get the level anyway
copium copium copium hit the elephant
please
oh that works too
okay we smack the
smack this is a loss
they got they got a lot of stats there
they got a lot of stats there you gotta
respect it
holy crap dude i mean so you you start
you start here
then here because we love this unit i
mean a swan is just a beautiful thing
then we do this we get a worm who up
playing with a worm right now
omg me
i think you
i think we try to level this beaver as
crazy as it sounds the mosquito is going
bye-bye
in order to i think we get worm garlic
and save some food the mosquito will go
bye-bye
but not yet we'll roll one time
it's not uh okay i just did it
i don't know why sometimes my brain is
like yeah that's freeze
that's fine i don't think
you know what we're probably going to
sell our fish too freeze me okay we're
in the midst of it of a two-turn pivot
we really really don't want to lose this
one holy crap
is golden poop in the highest stats i've
ever seen
and we draw that's kind of amazing
bad difference thank you
it's funny because like the beaver's
whole purpose is being sold and yet here
we are
not selling it
um
but just work with me here okay
2-2 with garlic armor now we're now
we're talking
again as long as we're not losing
i really wanted a pair there but
as long as we're not losing i kind of
consider this all an investment in the
future
now maybe we did lose one but like
i mean i'm keeping the units that i have
with the best stats which is the
scariest thing of it all
garlic's not gonna do too much for us
here yeah this is a loss
um
floundering a little bit here but
there's still still plenty of time we
like to see this
we love to see that all it didn't take
too long huh look at this now we got a
nine nine worm
you can definitely roll a hatching chick
behind the worm in the future maybe this
is where we sell this beaver although i
i wouldn't mind getting it one level up
um
we need to win rounds like there's a
reasonable chance we lose this round
right here and i'd say reasonable was a
bit of a
charitable read of that situation
i'm i'm telling you this is my hot take
for this video this is not coming from a
position of salt whatsoever my hot take
on this video
is that i actually
thank you
genuinely think
pay to win
craps on
do we want garlic on anybody i mean
technically we could kind of roll this
for a minute yeah i know it looks like a
waste but just work with me something
like that um and you know what you're a
good fit as well i don't know what we're
gonna dump to have you but let's worry
about that if we live i genuinely think
free to play craps on pay to win but it
might just be the way i play the game
i'll acknowledge it it might just be the
way i play the game
i play the game on like anybody i ever
seen do it
we lose these
wow
you game over me on a two win
it's like oh whoops
never seen that before
i'm still happy i'm still okay with the
way it went down i'm just saying
like
we we got craft on by what seemed like
so many free-to-play builds maybe pay to
win in the maybe the dream with pay to
win is you survive you don't necessarily
have to win early if you survive to the
late rounds you let the op units carry
you
i'm like frida plays the way to go but
anyway thanks for watching hope you
enjoyed the episode if you did click the
like button helps out a great deal we're
learning and i'll see you next time see
ya



yeah we're back we got a half hour and a
half hour only
my
goal
we gotta make some progress i have a hot
take okay i've got a hot take
on super auto pets it's very simple
free to play is better than pay to win i
had thought
that that was not the case because you
put five dollars into the game you think
you'd get an advantage i genuinely from
playing a lot of free to play and from
playing a lot of pay to win last night
free to play is stronger than pay to win
i 100 believe it but i also think that
possibly
it could just be where we're at in the
meta right now
maybe there's a strategy on pay to win
that could start to beat this crab
strategy like can i tell you something i
feel like the way
that you beat crab strategy
which is just taking over the meta right
now is you get crocodiles and dolphins
the crocodiles and dolphins shoot the
crabs before
they
steal the hp
from the unit in front of them
or skunks
skunks it's an interesting idea okay
let's let's give it a try here this is
not a great start this is an abandonable
game
by a beaver
and now we're in a slightly better
position but let's see
um
be the subtle swimmers like i'm swimming
but like you wouldn't know it unless you
really looked at oh sorry sorry bats
bats bats bets
pop it out
will nl get six wins or more i'm just
letting you know the new meta as we
defined it yesterday
pay to win has an advan disadvantage pay
to win has a disadvantage so just be
ready okay that's all i'm saying
i'm not trying to massage i'm not trying
to massage in either direction i'm just
saying
anything could happen here
um
in this house we don't love this squad
but that's okay give me give me a 3-3
toss me a little ladybug
the crabs have taken over
the crabs have taken over the meadow
without a doubt
4-2 not good
not good
we lose these we lose that's a strong
theme the milky buttocks
my girlfriend got her first 10 piece and
now she's only saying juice me squeeze
me and you peace help what do you need
help with
uh not proposing to her for being the
love of your life
after watching my stream i don't
understand what the problem is
okay ant me ant me
hatching chick is is pog tier there's no
doubt about that
you're going to give me a hatching chick
that's going to buff this ant then the
ant's going to buff something else
you're going to sell one of these you're
going to put a little swan up in here
we don't care for a fish we're gonna
freeze a pill for future purposes okay
nine eight and
making me feel a certain sort of way
horse build interesting
double level one horses
i gotta be honest
feel like this isn't gonna go how you
think
i'm telling you straight up horses are
are close to unplayable
in the modern meta
i think we can keep the ant briefly
i think you're gonna sell one of these
to take a second swan for a moment
the swan is gonna be our new uh
legendary gamer soon
we can start to talk about building a
swan up
i'm thinking okay i'm thinking
there's a chance i i do look at the
chance of a four squad marty
don't hit the ants let's go that's
that's extremely nice extremely nice
thank you
roll me one time
honestly i know how this looks
i'll take a quick little beaver we'll
sell it back next turn i'm not sweating
it we need garlic we're gonna we're
gonna peel the ant which will give it
one hp from the from the uh bunny big
brain strategies we're gonna sell the
beaver that much is is a given
owns
please please please we needed that to
hit properly it did not hit properly
we draw these i'll accept the draw here
the wet hipsters
okay beaver get iced
get out my face
i don't even care that you hit the ant
that doesn't even bother me
then
hit the swan please
thanks for the buff
hit the bunny you know what it makes the
bunny slightly more playable we don't
say no to that give me a cricket for the
time being
give me a second bunny
that's what we needed
that's what we freaking needed man
cricket caterpillar whatever same
difference
hold on we're still pogging
we're still pogging
we're still pot this is a win guaranteed
win
no sweat okay more foods please more
foods level three swahili level two swan
young llama fortnite moan
for now i sleep
i imo too late for a puppy i want some
foods give me some real foods
please
we don't sweat that thanks so much for
your support i really appreciate it
roll me
back me just in case that's it just in
case ben
the garlic has no porpoise unfortunately
we can think about it we can here's what
they think about you okay
hey nl can i borrow your sap crab nft
for my runs we're currently running a
scholarship program so i'll consider it
but
i'm going to tell you it's going to cost
you it's going to cost you
three wins two losses that's a nasty
team but you know what losing is winning
in this unique situation because now we
get a chance to take advantage of our
snail build
we should have bought the pair first
that's my bad it's a my bad situation
then this is gonna hit the swan
guaranteed
by me
freeze me
by me
freeze me roll me i'm telling i'm just
telling you we're not out of the woods
yet this is a little bit it's a little
bit spicy i'd like to see this
caterpillar pop off a little bit faster
like ever since we changed the meta
it would i mean i did the honorable
thing by changing the meta because
like i'm just being legitimate with you
i could have just kept knocking out 10
spots day after day nobody believed in
me everybody said my meadow was stupid
now that we got what 17 wins in a row or
something crazy all of a sudden people
are like oh let me give this a try
so now
now that we've broken the meta it's time
for us to break our own meta
the the old meta self break
no thank you
yes thank you
yes thank you
yes thank you roll me again
yes thank you yes thank you it's going
to take us like 12 turns to actually get
everything we want but that's okay
white weeny build
okay so our hatching chick is not long
for this world why are big dog 320
why are you still rolling
a white weenie build
in 2021 like we're oh never mind i think
it might actually get us
i think it's definitely actually gonna
get
us never mind we win these easily
big dog 320. don't you watch the stream
what are you doing
there's four wins easy mode
okay you're about to pop
a brontosaurus it's kind of interesting
but i say no to this
that's what you love to see
probably try something like this now 15
24 maybe if she's five foot two okay
that's good freeze me
go with the bison it's too late baby
it's too late for the bison it had its
chance hit me hit me the hippo hit the
hippo
the
fly
ew
okay this is pretty nasty they got a
little crab build going on here you
little crab freak
nice try
you will never be me
we win again
there's a believer payout
take me to the next level absolutely not
under no circumstances this one goes out
to all the bunny haters out there
all the people who hated the bunny when
i was just trying to make enough food to
feed my daughter make enough money to
feed my daughter it was all a dream
i used to read word up magazine
this is a simple play
it's a
buff
a cell
the world's most beautiful cow
and then a little yummy yummy a little
yummy yummy
that's what we like to see
could it could have used that weakness
on some different units not gonna lie to
you
two chicks at the same time we still win
these
no sweat
even with the worst bat luck of all time
there we go
now you can do i mean this is they
wouldn't teach you about this in sap
school you got to be like a phd
candidate
now we just started feeding them foods
nah man nah
although it is plus two hp but you know
what yeah man
nah
okay the way you play this i i hate to
do it steve 5693 thank you
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
the bunny no no level 3 bunny is not the
play
it's not bad but it's not the play
instead we do something
like that
put a little scorpion out in front
little scorpion freak
save two chocolates
save two thank you my apm is a little
low here
we still we still lose to a lot of
builds this is not an id oh actually you
know what it's a very ideal scorpion
build thank you so much they got a very
similar situation going on here but i'm
you but stronger
now that snake's gonna do some serious
damage to us
please get out of here like stop hitting
exclusively my uh my bat over and over
we win these we win these
bad i mean butterfly it's still early in
the morning cut me some slack
okay we're not getting rid of you yet
forget the swan man forget the bunny
level three bat will win you games
all on its lonesome
want to see some good foods please
whatever i'll live with it i'll live
with it to get that extra turn and
weakness out there and a much better
chance to override some nasty equipment
double scorpion oh
turns out your scorpions freaking suck
jimmy turns out your scorpions freaking
suck
there's eight
okay very important to get a total out
here if you can if you can muster it
i actually don't think you're that
valuable like i think
what do you get rid of like i think you
freeze a turtle we got more buffs
incoming first
don't make me laugh
as long as we got one hp to play with
i'm chilling for now
theoretically the scorpion could live a
little bit
could live a little bit it's not gonna
live a little bit but it's gonna do some
serious work overrode your melon armor
you piece
we got you we got you we got you nice
bisons
that's nine wins
i'm bing chilling yeah
dude i love the bing chilling video i
can't
i can't get over it
something about seeing john cena speak
what what to my ears appears to be
fluent mandarin
well pimping some kind of weird ice ice
cream treat is like so good
it's it's kind of unbelievable like it
breaks my brain just to just to watch it
and now kind of cracked at this game for
real i i warned you i warned you and
nobody believed me we could still get
nine like this is not a guaranteed squad
a little freaked out by that level two
turtle their turtle counters are build a
little bit but
oh you peace
we are one hp away from getting the draw
there but alas
sometimes sometimes it works out
sometimes it doesn't it's okay because
either way the time has definitely come
to get rid of
the bunny it had its chance and it did
good stuff we got a 47 there now we got
a
guaranteed total coming out on you
dude there is something to be said like
we already got nine wins we paid out the
believers okay let's get stupid
let's sell a scorpion
put a microbe behind our swan
so that our swan goes and then
our microbe dies weakens everything on
both sides
which then leads to
our turtle
giving melon armor to our caterpillar
and having a chance
but you got a good point we do already
weaken three things with our bed
which means
we should actually sell our level 3 bat
and then roll this nightmare squash
this looks
absolutely horrible
but it's zany it's zany let me tell you
hold on
i mean i don't want to overwrite
anything on the scorpion i guess
honestly now you could chocolate up your
turtle put a level 2 turtle in here
and then you would go like scorpion
no because you want to you want to go
microbe
i'll be no you don't want your
score okay you have to go scorpion at
the front so it doesn't get overridden
by the weakness
then
microbe will make everything weak your
turtle will die give melon armor to the
two things behind it
i mean this is very
weird
hey look at that ideal though but it's
very fun as well dude we're on nine wins
we already paid out the believers who
cares so we were a little concerned
about the melon armor but
all right we'll pay out the believers on
that one um
will now get six wins or more yes
we got nine wins
can't help but feel that in hindsight
probably would have been good to have
that level three bat to have a 60 chance
to override the melon armor on the rhino
and give us a much better chance of
success but
so be
we'll run one more back we'll run one
more back we've got 10 minutes here
dub mosquito
as straight up garbage here
um
i would rather have a 2-2 than a 2-1
even with some persistence
be a shiny bell tower
we got bing chilled you're absolutely
right i gotta i gotta learn the whole
script for that bing chilling video man
like he goes off
i'll just go ahead and say it this mf
spitting we lose these by the way
this is a very acceptable loss
like this this is a strong squad
that we ran up against and our squad is
freaking garbage
um
look
i'll just be straight up with you
you gotta do it
i wish we didn't have to do it but you
absol if you see it you gotta
oh
oh man that's good stuff we win these by
the way
it's just fun dude
and again like when you get the option
you actually have to
i'm sorry but i never had a choice
now
now i want a bison man
now i want a bison
okay i hate to tell you this we're gonna
take a puppy
but it's not gonna scale on this turn i
think the turtle is very important
i think the puppy we want to get it for
the i guess we should have bought a bat
instead in that case but
whatever no no no big deal here
i accept this 7-7 mosquito that shoots
something for three right oh man this is
that's exactly what you want to hit but
this is kind of messed up man
although no no we lose these
yeah
it's just a nasty team the tubby turkeys
we were rolling a three squad marty with
a 1-1 at the back so i mean what do you
expect but
now we can fight
pill is pretty good
but
not till our next turn i accept this
yummy
holy crap
this seems okay
it seems it seems very okay
it's it's me but worse it's true that's
true
true true that's true that's true
um
i mean the bunny build has got something
going on we did it last time for sure
like i'm a big believer in the bunny we
got to go a little faster though
that's my problem here we got to go a
little faster maybe give me like
something like this
i'm a big believer in the in the buy
sell on an owl
doesn't bother me in the slightest why
don't you toss me a little bunny and we
can literally buy one more thing
uh let's
let's keep feeding this mosquito for the
time being
puppies starting to get there
i'm not sweating the bunny too much
you peace
you're a crab wow get get get a new
trick
you peace
wow crab strats hello viewer hello
viewer
okay we got problems we got one life
left
please
okay now we're talking
give me one of these
give me one of these
this is a squad that wins
for a bit
oh okay okay okay unfreeze you then
freeze you
this squad wins for a bit but
we gotta get a little bit further we
gotta get uh what the heck is this
oh that's very bad luck for you is what
it is
we win these for sure
the tier list enjoyer has logged on
you have my interest
lobster build
don't make me laugh
yummy that's a garlic's always no no
because we need more foods we need more
foods
do not microbe
yeah but here's the thing like last time
i know it could have worked for us and
didn't but it's kind of sick like if it
worked by the way what the heck you got
a 25-31 dog
we lose these you have a 25-31
dog
holy crap there's no it's not a refund
we lost we pay out the doubters that's
just kind of amazing
okay we have five minutes i'm not even
running bets for this one i literally
closed the casino window this is a five
minute speed run of super auto pets any
percent i'm not even thinking about my
decisions edition
i'll be the fatherly baguettes it's
perfect
holy crap

yeah buy me um
then we got some dang like two threes
down here two three me him him me go go

four minutes focused i'm focusing it's
true true very true so true nice eating
nice eating nice selling
you love to see it okay what else
happens when you buy food you get
stronger when you buy food you get
stronger

i'm not thinking i'm not thinking i'm
not trying to think freeze me we'll make
this scampi build pop
faster please there needs to be like
like can you remember when slay the
spire
first came out maybe not maybe some of
you were too young um they had like uh a
fast mode and then they had to add like
an even faster mode because people were
like
this is not fast enough for my brain
that's like where we're at right now
with this like they need to add like a
like an instant resolution speed
okay good stuff
honestly you're trash
three squad marty 11 16
ladybug

not work for us
but it could work temporarily and be a
little funny which is that's worth
something to me
anytime you live through melon armor at
least for that first crack you're a very
happy man we still lose these
for sure guess oh you're rolling a crab
plus meat congratulations
i invented crab plus meat we got one

well



hey everybody welcome back super auto
pets excited to be here um i just played
the game with ludwig he has introduced
the game to 20 000 new viewers i figured
there was no choice for me but to log on
play some free to play i mean i hate to
do this
free to play versus other free to play
in a free-to-play game with a bunch of
new gamers oh
it's like christmas morning and i'm a
call of duty pro get ready i'm i
i can't personally guarantee you we're
gonna win
every single game
i can't personally guarantee that all
i'm gonna say is i like our chances
overall let's be the shiny minerals
marie i'm ready to go by the way i would
laugh i would say hahaha
lucky us
if we ended up getting into a situation
where we uh
ended up doing very very badly in spite
of the fact that there's an influx of
new players
let's cross that bridge when we come to
it shall we so we'll start with
something like this honestly i'm not a
believer in the pig but if you you know
any port in a storm you know we like
those three three earlies we keep the
shooters in the back shooter tag is
attack attached yeah i know how to speak
sorry a little bit low on the brain
glycogen we got a scary team here they
got my ant which is bad news
mosquito difference is in play i think
we draw these i'll take that i'll take a
draw
i think our team is uh is not that
impressive so a draw is acceptable in
this situation you can't win them all
you can't win um all
now what do you think about
the idea i think it looks like this okay
i think you want to guarantee yourself a
good dodo
to try to get something going early
maybe you could fit a crab into this
deck as well how would that look
you would combine mosquitoes
to minimize the risk of hitting a
mosquito although hitting a mosquito
wouldn't necessarily be bad here
we're going to buy a duck
immediately sell a duck
now we got a 2-4
we're going to place it right behind the
ant because it gives us a better chance
for the payout
it doesn't but that would have been kind
of funny you gotta admit like
freeze me a meat because if we get a
crab it's gonna be top tier
um
honestly like 5'4 you're already kind of
chilling let's get let's create two five
fours with a little two four in the
middle the beavers i would like but it's
just not it's not really built for it
right now i'm not a full believer in
this squad yet but i think we did okay
given the circumstances
little 5-5 ant at the back is a touch
scary don't get me wrong
we don't survive those we trade here
we don't survive this we we draw these
we draw these considering the 5-5
elephant i'm not sweating it i'm kind of
happy with the draw quite frankly i'm so
cracked that a draw is just like a it's
like a win for me
you know we're gonna roll a crab so it's
gonna be like a mosquito
we don't need a blowfish
uh you can fit you do it like this okay
oh you gotta sell something okay sorry
honestly like a 3-3 pig is good but the
gold is is some serious leverage for us
then we're gonna have uh it's gonna look
like this so the crabs gonna get
hp from the mosquito obviously we want a
little bit more coming out of you you're
gonna be a you're only gonna have five
right now
now you're gonna have a ten so you're
basically a ten five roll me we don't
need another crab
unless
and then you just toss one of these so
now we got a a 9 8 that feeds into a
10-8 and two anchors in the back just
kind of biden time until they get
eliminated
i i'm a bigger believer in my squad now
i mean honestly like garlic craps on
their squad but we don't have garlic yet
so i i i will say oh that turtle's kind
of nasty the thing is like the turtle
screws up their bee but actually that's
good for us for them
[Laughter]
if if they had to be
that their horse would have popped but
the melon is actually just better so i
think to be honest with you we kind of
got a little bit screwed there but it's
we still won so i'm not complaining now
you know a fish is not long for this
world here's what i think you do sell a
fish
buy a salad bowl did not hit our crab we
needed it to hit the crab to be able to
fit the other crab in we're gonna do
some high octane gaming here
that's perfect it's perfect okay so this
is a little weird
but look look at me okay i'm the captain
now
we got a seven six you are going to
become
a
a essentially a 10-6 you are going to
become
a six-six
which coincidentally is my height that
is a a beautiful shop and some garlic
armor it's honestly it's just nice to
have it i think it would do okay on a
mosquito for a bit i'm gonna freeze both
i know we got like 15 gold where of
stored value here you just got to work
with me okay it's rome wasn't built in a
day that dodo we're keeping around for
the future that's bad luck
okay let's see how this goes we kill you
we kill you this one's not even close
you get us oh you know what you're a
little spicy i i recognize you as well i
recognize you from chat that team's
gonna pop eventually but not yet i've
got the utmost faith in you okay now
it's just getting silly um
you know we want this you know we want
this now all of a sudden you're gonna be
a 13-6 which means you need to get some
extra attack or alternatively
i mean we could go buck wild
no that's silly
um for now i'm gonna do this
and i'm gonna i'm gonna keep this stuff
frozen i like the double freeze shop
this is fine
this is fine i i like where we're at
three wins in five rounds because this
is round six i'm not guaranteeing you
wins here i'm not guaranteeing you wins
but we do it certainly we have a very
interesting squad here oh we're gonna
lose this one this this a nasty team
with a strong dog
now we gotta start to think about either
scaling you with a monkey or getting the
pivot in there i think it's gonna be
like we're gonna start here
a little turkey i don't really roll the
turkey bill but i don't disrespect it
okay
i don't mean to disrespect it at least
get rid of this meat that's that's silly
we really need and and nobody really
likes the one one but just keep in mind
it's not really a one one it's like a
one three because we're passing it you
know down the down the line here um
i i actually think i'm stupid i think we
should have garlic on our third crab
that's such good luck oh my god we're
we're freaking cracked man we're
freaking cracked
we do die here but then we kill you we
kill you we kill you we draw we draw
okay
we're trying we're lifting a heavy
weight it's going to take a little time
as much as i love our swan i think the
time has come to bail on it and say
thank you for the gold
then
we buy a rabbit
we start feeding you
this doesn't really matter who it hits
that's very good that's very good for us
we will roll we're looking for some
garlic we could freeze a rabbit for a
second cupcake is fine by the way we
can't afford a salad the salad is a
little too risky here so we'll just get
a second rabbit that's i i do not like
the second rabbit in that situation but
if it's got to be done it's got to be
done
how do i like the squat here i would
have liked them more well no we don't
care to pop their melon armor now that i
think about it they're just going to ice
us that is what it is and then how we do
in
here we draw these okay we're drawing
too much for a team like this to win
late game we need to think about getting
rid of our mosquito to get something
going i know that sounds insane
if we can scale our health a little bit
better then i'll start to think about
this like you can definitely as scary as
this looks you can totally roll this to
get two extra hp and then one of these
will also give two extra hp which makes
all our crabs stronger
i don't like seeing that we're on turn
nine that's where things start to get a
little freaky for me you're gonna snipe
my no
you should have shot the rabbit
not i mean like i'm not sweating it not
because i think we're not gonna lose but
because that's uh i mean maybe it was a
50 50 and they got the 50. you know i
don't disrespect it i respect it we draw
these
we need to get some wins at some point
i mean if the dolphin shoots the rabbit
we win that so easily like your head
spins but
you can start to think about a worm but
i need to see a good shop in order to
make this happen
i hate to say because the rab has been
doing some kind of sick work for us
the monkey is kind of like it's a late
gamer i i think you sell the dodo
i hate to say it i think you sell the
dodo
now you got a double buff coming in here
freeze me can't afford to do it i hate
to say it but i can't afford to do give
me a try
that's beautiful
now it doesn't matter who gets hit by
this other one
beautiful beautiful you know what let me
tell you
no we're not going to roll three crabs
come on the other hand let's think if we
get down to one hp we'll actually be
happy we got the crabs there so this we
got a little bit of a chain crab
situation going on here if you're not
familiar with the chain crabbing
um
the animals with
the
highest hp or sorry the highest attack i
should say go first when it comes to
using their active effects we draw these
by the way we draw these
we've created the ultimate draw build
dude i don't know like the mosquito is
like it shouldn't still be around and
yet here it is
i'm gonna keep that crab frozen for long
enough that you're gonna be upset i'm
just gonna let you know that okay just
keep in mind you are going to be upset i
promise you
you will be upset by how long this crab
stays frozen
the crab is like a late game marty for
us
okay so they're they're rolling a dodo
we we pivoted off of our dodo let's see
who ends up being the most cracked holy
birch them
[Laughter]
there turns out uh dodo
oh
baby it turns out dodo
um
rooster kind of cracked huh so i'm not
sweating it though i hate to say it but
for now the monkey's going we can get
another one later
you're eating good we're trying to get
your hp as high as possible we're
rolling
we're eating
lots of hp coming out
applying to units we do not care if they
get it at all but why don't you take one
of these
roll me
once you can always freeze a scorpion
for like scorpion attempted plays we
don't really need more hp i would just
like to get to four wins at this point i
feel like we've kind of
you know
put ourselves in a weird spot here
got a lot of very strong units but
that that feels pretty good that feels
pretty good this one this is the great
renaissance all the we get a temporary
dip in the power curve because all the
great builds just went like 10 and two
now we get to play against the
the people who are not doing so hot and
i think that's going to be pretty
advantageous for us this is uh all sushi
for now
i want a sushi while the sun's up okay
because we're not uh keeping the rabbit
around for life or pizza
i wish the steak made sense to apply to
anybody but i think it's we're much more
likely to benefit from a roll and i'll
tell you if i'm being honest with you in
my heart of hearts i think you sell a
cow and you throw a temporary scorpion
out here maybe freeze yourself some
sushi and see how it goes so we're no
matter what we're at a minimum of a 50
50 here and we respect it the camel's
gonna go
the camel's gone
camel is going bye-bye the kangaroo is a
nightmare but never mind it's dead
we win this for sure
look at this okay
normally i would like to be at 10 wins
or dead by this point but we're gonna
just have to persevere um
i think
no offense scorpion but we're gonna sell
you just to make sure the right units
get get fed here
always love to get more attack this is
the play okay so you get a very simple
snake rolling here and then we toss you
one of these
and then soon
we dump our
rabbits
in order to roll
another crab and then we have three 50
50 crabs well not 50 50 but we got three
solid crabs this is a nightmare man this
is a nightmare this is a nightmare
you're you're a part of my nightmares
right now
yeah this is not good not good
that hippo was was
they were popping okay
i think i think the time has come you're
at 26.46 we like that so we're gonna do
a sell
it's gonna be a buy the cow
you're gonna take two of these now we
got the 50 hp you love to see we're
going to sell the cow we want to put
another crab down
there's some stuff we could do in the
meantime though
we want to put another crab down yeah
yeah yeah crab garlic
i don't think so man i don't think so
crab melon a melon on the snake is a
potential game saver i think you at
least have to consider the option
okay
now i your safety is not guaranteed but
let's take a look let's see if the
cascading crab can get the job done here
you never know
okay it's not gonna get the job done
here this is a nightmare team honestly
the thing you need to know about this is
that
the reason we lost this one is not
because our team is bad it's because our
team is too bad to be here in the late
game like we this this crab build needs
to pop off a little bit faster to have a
chance okay so we got five on that first
one it's not quite foddered here let's
be honest it's not quite like at the
level where uh
you know you're gonna be super like uh
gloating or whatever especially because
i just saw ludwig get a 10-win with a
bus as his front line unit
makes me feel a certain sort of way
about the meta right now let's be the
soft buttocks clean buttocks also good
but i'm i'm feeling like we just ran
into a lot of nasty draws
if we didn't get so many nasty draws i
think we could have been okay
we win these by the way mosquito
difference hey
i'm you're you're shooting my fish i'm
shooting her your ants we're not the
same
or something um give me one of these
give me one of these
mosquito hit please we accept that frees
me a beaver it's okay you can roll it
it's not as good as a fish though it is
not as good as a fish okay
two ants a four four mosquito
two three fish in an otter what the heck
this is a nightmare
is it genuinely like pretty bad oh but
that's incredible luck we win these the
way that those ants played out could not
have been better for us i think i think
the better team just lost quite frankly
and to which i say very nice okay so we
need
next level you can temporarily roll a
giraffe your squad would look like this
please hit the mosquito
at least it's like a functional unit now
we're going to feed the mosquito
temporarily i'm just going to be honest
with you fish it was nice while it
lasted roll me
of these you freeze a crab for the
future freezer pill you roll a swan for
the temporary benefits
we like the scaling i need to do like a
mosquito
that scales and then we could have the
crab play off it at some point lucky us
very lucky us i might add
we win these we do not die to a b which
means we win these and then we win these
okay
i don't know how we're playing this yet
an otter would go a long way towards
defining a meta for me i don't think
we're there
i gotta be honest there's a part of me
that's like to be straight up with you a
double crab meta would do some great
work here
why don't you give me a sell
a buy
and
please hit either the mosquito or the
crab the crab would be huge
a swan is still really good i'm not
gonna i'm not gonna cry about it i'm not
gonna squirt some
so here's what you're gonna do okay
we got the giraffe is all sorts of
messed up i think you have to roll
giraffe and swan at the back
and then you're gonna roll a crab a
mosquito at the front
a crab and then you're gonna make this
crab have more attack so that it it
fills in backwards
i know this looks absolutely insane
right now
i mean you kind of got it
and then the swan will get buff and we
can move this stuff around a little bit
like we don't basically what i'm saying
is we don't need both of these
we don't need a swan and a mosquito but
now i'm looking at it increasingly i'm
realizing we're probably gonna
what the heck's going on here what the
heck is that that's going on out there
anyway we win these crab cascade crab
cascade early i'm thinking is cracked
the problem is i know people are like
what are you doing well the thing is you
might think why not buff the unit you
want to feed the hp to the crabs there's
a problem with that and i think you can
probably tell what it is
all of a sudden we're stealing
three
uh three health from the giraffe instead
of six from the swan or the mosquito so
i think you either roll like this
or you roll like that you know you get
the idea those are functionally kind of
similar so i think for now
straight up i think you buff
i think you buff the mosquito and take a
round where the crabs might not do it
for you because the mosquitoes about to
hit level three
and then we're probably i mean the
giraffe might not be long for this world
so i i want to just acknowledge i'm
taking around here
uh
where i accept
that's big
that we're minimizing our chances of
winning this round but it's in order to
get some maximal crab action next time i
hope but i gotta be honest with you
we're coming up against a nasty squad
here
although
we did pretty well there we win these
we win these
you gotta get that mosquito man
okay now i'm like
if you wanna win rounds
we'll roll this for now but this is like
this is weird
it's not ideal you could roll a deer on
this team i honestly think if you sold
the giraffe
and rolled a deer at the front you'd
probably do some good work now we can't
use
uh salad right now it's just a little
too dangerous
i think we'll keep the swan for now
let's roll into a dream shop
we can maybe fit one more crab one more
snail
honestly this is the kind of round that
you don't mind losing
because the two snails would be a really
nice kind of scale factor for us
we'll take that i guess
oh man your mosquito freaking or my
mosquito does not live that's kind of
nasty though we lose these by one by one
the giraffe would have kept us in there
man
but we wanted to lose now that i think
about it we wanted to lose
honestly dude forget uh the deer we're
going for 10 wins immediately
so snail me
sell me
snail me
do you see what i see by the way now
another crab has joined the fray
honestly you kind of need the gas
we'll buff you next turn
no thanks yes please
acceptable
this is a dirty team this is the kind of
like i feel like team iceland in the
mighty ducks too right now this team is
kind of disgusting
like that's just i i feel like that's
not the way that should work but i'm
very glad that it does appear to work
that way
because like
we got like a 13 12 a 7 12 and an 8 12
and then a 10 8 at the back like that's
that's pretty nasty i don't think it
necessarily scales super well but the
wins in the early game plus every time
we buff a unit
as long as it's the unit at the front
we're basically buffing all of the units
behind it
it's kind of it's this is kind of sick
honestly and i mean sick like in the
twisted sort of way honestly like
replace a 10 8 with a
what like a 317 sure don't mind if i do
i mean i i kind of feel bad i stole this
uh meta by the way i stole it from my
subreddit so if anything it's not my
fault it's the subreddit's fault
how could they do something like this
okay we we actually
like trade there and then we kill you we
didn't even get to kill our third crab
man this is like
this is
this is broken we can't roll five crabs
that's the eventually you hit
diminishing returns
thank you
make way please make way
now you just need to get buffed as much
as possible
can i can i feed you no they they
literally won't even let me how sad is
that oh nevertheless
[Laughter]
i don't know if this is the play but
it's really funny and it's also like
really good so i think it might be oh
they got their own crab
what the heck is going on here i don't
know the turtle is really good but i
think we still get you here
crab difference by the way crab
difference i mean this is rude they i i
really think they got to consider
nerfing the the crab strats quite
frankly but
me i don't even know if the devs knew
that this is how it worked okay so i'm
not like you know advocating
that they made a mistake here i'm just
to some extent i'm kind of just like
this is how it goes
we want you know what we want meat why
am i not taking meat instead i'm adding
like plus one hp now and then what the
heck is even this
what is this this weird turkey build i
kind of love it
i kind of respect it
i don't know are you waiting for your
fly like is that the play there
honestly like you're not that scary man
you're not that scary
do we own you
we draw
a draw you know i sometimes say when
you're scaling a draw is a win this is
the opposite like a draw is a huge loss
um for now i like this we don't need the
melon you can freeze a snake
there may be some situations in this
game where
quite frankly like a snake beats uh
uh one of these crabs we already got
going
we really need to pick up some winds
fast otherwise we're gonna melt over
time because it's not like the mosquito
is renowned for its late-game prowess
one crab
that's what i say about that one crab
do they laugh when you step up at the at
the buffet with your one crab
do they say where's the rest of the crab
my guess is yes
so straight up you don't have meat on
you okay so here's what i think you do
we roll the meat we keep you frozen
the snake works super well here because
you know even if we're buffing you
we still like
get more hp on all the crabs which means
the snake is getting more opportunities
to fire anyway i mean straight i was
mighty tempting i know you're like
double snake i would never disrespect my
my crabs like that
i would sell one i would not sell two
all right so let's see if we don't win
this one we can start to think about
putting the snake in but i mean like
this is just a nasty team man i'm i'm
very scared of that dog we don't do so
much damage that we shouldn't be
frightened here
that had to go down like that
how many you got
one
we draw these
we lose these okay fair enough dev
bought two congratulations
you built a team that can beat
my team congrats whatever
it's not a big deal yeah sure
holy i wish i had known but that's okay
honestly i think we could live with some
garlic just so that like you survive a
snipe i guess a one-up would do the same
but um
but actually better
okay okay what do we got we broke your
melon armor that seems pretty big
obviously that's a problem dude
they're freaking cracked man they're
freaking cracked
that we we've hit the scaling wall this
is what it's all about right here uh i
would love to see
a tiger yeah that's that's pretty much
what it had to be we're pivoting out of
this build before it gets too dangerous
another cupcake would hit the spot for
sure but without that okay let's see
let's see
this is for all the marbles it's a scary
squad holy
oh my god
dude that's what i get for putting the
leopard in like unusable tear that tiger
leopard
tiger leopard monkey think about that
hey great great video though i had a
great time thanks for watching hope you
enjoyed if you did click the like button
this is the crab cascade and i'll see
you next time see ya



everybody we are back um hey but you
know what put me back on all packs we'll
stay free to play but all packs this
time
we're recording this as you can tell by
the hoodie we're recording this you know
in the same
ballpark
as uh when we did the last video we went
five five wins nine wins so for a 14 and
eight not bad but we can do better can i
tell you something interesting here
i think the problem is you can freeze an
otter but then you're forced into
whatever your two other creatures are
however is it possible that our two
other creatures could be worse than
cricket and duck i think the answer is
no
yeah okay i'm not disappointed by this
now here the real question is
do we want a 4-4 beaver and a 2-3 otter
or do we want to take the chance of
maybe having a 3-3-2-3-1-2
um i'm going to i'm going to try a new
meta okay and the meta is going to look
like this
three three we get a four four if that
was a fish and it was a four or five i
would be like a hundred percent
confident we can't lose
be the
vivid it'll be the frigid astronauts
like we're ladies and gentlemen we are
floating in space i think a 4-5-2-3
almost like mathematically can't lose um
we're going to win but i think it's
juiced and squeezed pill honestly it's
because we're going up against ducks i
what on earth is this this is insane
normally you would wait for the next
turn to get things popping
not this time
honestly like and i'm just being sincere
i'm gonna i'm gonna start building up
another one man like ripped to you if
you go up against this squad it's turn
two and we got a 10-10 beavert
like okay we we actually could lose i'm
looking at the optics so this is no
we're not going to lose
that's just a nightmare that's
oh my god a double digit unit on
on this turn that of course we're going
to we're going to feed you more now
you're 13 13. i don't see why we
wouldn't start getting another one going
man
oh come on you peace
ox is good enough like you can freeze
the knocks roll once
straight up i think you roll a swan
early just because i don't see us losing
this man and and if we can get garlic on
our if we can get okay i hate to say
because we roll it literally every game
but this run is like perfectly built for
crab right now
too
we we just roll you it's like i i don't
even know what to say like we just got
so lucky getting so many otters and then
building for one unit instead of
building for more was like
it was a really good play quite frankly
um i think you can roll
i don't want to lose our early momentum
that's the thing so i don't think we're
getting garlic yet but
um do we want to roll an ox out here i
think you can
so what i'm hoping
is for like
i mean if we have to feed you an apple i
wouldn't be opposed
you know what that's a great point i
think we actually do a little bit better
here we say goodbye to this otter you
were a nice prospect for us you'll be
sold eventually but a 3-4 with melon
armor kind of sick and then we'll just
put a 3-5 elephant at the back that's
just ballast
likely to be sold later
the next thing we want is garlic if we
can get garlic like it's over man
i i
genuinely uh 13 13 even now is kind of
insane
okay so there's place to be made here
this is where we'll be looking for
garlic you definitely can make do with a
kangaroo right there
i don't see garlic it's the first thing
i look for every time
i'll be straight up with you as well i
think we can look to build um
a team
around this 1313
so i think we can take a little bit of
time and what we can do for example is
like kill a swan
um
with a pill and then legitimately just
roll a giraffe that buffs
this ox to make it even actually
honestly like why don't we buff the
kangaroo it's maybe more likely to stick
around
um and it doesn't really matter too much
how this goes because we should be in an
amazing spot to you know just be big
chilling right now and i think that
there's a case to be made for maybe you
if we have this much room to play with
you could sell
your seven eight otter if you're willing
to get a little cocky
buy a rabbit and then you know shove a
quick little uh salad out there
i know this might look a little funky
but if we get garlic on our beaver like
this is the first round in a bit that we
stand a chance to possibly lose i think
if we can get garlic on this beaver like
i'm i'm feeling i'm being chilling i
said it i'll say it again i think we're
bing chilling in that situation this
kangaroo is gonna do some absolutely
unbelievable work
two-two badger
i don't sweat that he got mad weapons
too ain't trying to hear that if we're
only using like two spaces on our board
right now we might as well use the other
three to scale for the future
and to me i have to be honest with you i
think that means that you actually you
keep the giraffe because it scales you
sell your ox even though it's good and
it has equipment on it
you buy a second rabbit and then you
start you start feeding man you start
feeding them
a little extra hp never hurt freeze me
give me garlic if you're not gonna give
me garlic that's fine i accept garlic's
not for everybody all of a sudden we got
a 1918 out there with a four five behind
it
little lucky
oh my god okay we hit our first loss
it's the monkey
the monkey is very hard to deal with
okay
that's fine we're not sweating it
everything's okay
it's crazy that you're a level one so
you need the
the garlic instead of the meat everybody
knows this many people are saying this
we need to okay okay okay straight up
the giraffe is not going to cut it
forever
so give me one of these
feed me some of that
roll me once
you can think about more kangaroos in
the future
i think i think the worm is early enough
but i think the beaver is gonna be the
play by the way am i rolling past crabs
i haven't been paying attention i
blacked out for a minute
this looks okay
kangaroo's starting to pop this looks
okay
we love it
we love it
i'm telling this is like feed the beast
build right now
what can you say
now we got an 18 18 kangaroo we haven't
even put any investment in
you have to roll uh a crab i'm sorry
it's the game this is the way the game
is played and you play to win the game
you take one of these
if you'll excuse me my cat would like to
enter the office one moment please
welcome to the office this is a theme to
the office starring tomorrow
okay
now
i kind of feel like
hey buddy we got to give the crab meat
okay although it would be nice to buff
their
attack or maybe make them live longer
with garlic to buff our kangaroo it'll
fall off really really hard in the late
game i think so i think you just keep
the buffs going here
we roll we're looking for meats that's
fantastic
we don't get meat i'm a simple man we
freeze you we buff our kangaroo
we basically have two really good units
and the crab right now and the crab is
not quite where we need it to be but it
could get there in time
i'm worried by the way that tomo's gonna
pull my microphone cord out it has been
known to happen
we'll soon be getting to the point where
we're killing units um that have melon
armor just with our beaver and this
honestly this shouldn't show you the
value of the beaver or whatever it
should just show you the value of like
if you win your first three rounds if
you just like commit to winning early
you can do some serious damage man
even if your squad is not like so called
amazing tomorrow you can't you can't go
into the chords my man i'm i'm about to
set a world record there's a donkey kong
kill screen coming up
i still think we we keep this for the
for a second here sushi me
let's go let's go roll me once
tomorrow come on man
come it's getting a little absurd it's
tomo come on
skip
okay one of those all right i'm i'm
absolutely loving this you wanna i'm
sure you wanna see the cat okay
hello tomorrow say hi
you can go up on here for a second i
don't don't go behind the monitor i know
you're a behind the monitor
andy whatever people are saying these
days many people are saying this
we got an absolutely dynamite squad here
and now the the fills that you use
eventually you're going to sell the
rabbit you're going to get some uh
like some scorpions just to fill the
space and you're gonna be very happy
with it
okay now we can do this
you can scale everything with dragons
but i'm not totally sold that it's worth
it
you probably freeze this although
honestly i just want you to get some
more meat man i just want you to get
some more meat you could roll a skunk as
a fill but
i'm not i'm not totally sold on that i
think instead you could just do
something like this i think you put a
scorpion up in front and i i think quite
frankly you can say that right now we're
definitely bing chilling
it's a little nasty but i don't think
it's nasty enough that i am like
i'm disappointed like this seems okay
the real problem is that our crab is
useless uh in its own right but the
benefit is that
actually we lose these well done oh we
do thank god thank god we draw so we
don't have a ton of hp to play with if
we lose that
although a loss would have been nice for
scaling i mean you can straight up put a
parrot behind a crab here
and and consider yourself a genius but
i'm a snoozer i snooze on that here's
the plays are happening
you take one of these
you definitely take one of these
i was looking for a cow i did not
receive a cow
i think you roll this squad and you
re-roll for better items in the future i
see nothing that interests me
i honestly i feel like steak is maybe a
little overrated but not everybody's
going to agree on that
let's freeze a kangaroo just in case
we're only on round 11. like this is
still a very good spot no melon armor
please that's no melon armor
honestly your skunk just countered the
crap out of me like that's that's kind
of an incredible
strat you got there
we lose these don't don't get in the
cords don't get in the cords
note to self if you're going up against
crabs you know
you're going to want to
whatever
that's fine you're going to want to run
a skunk one skunk can do a lot of damage
do we want
straight on man at this
honestly give me one of these if we lose
we can sell that scorpion for some
scaling but we actually and this is a
little copium but we have a scorpion
that could theoretically live through an
attack here
that's not what's gonna happen
okay is this a front loaded squad
it's a bit front loaded
kangaroo's kind of going to be popping
but it's it's going to run into trouble
again
17 14 is not good
doesn't oh do we kill you we do okay
we're i mean we're getting stuck in nine
wins against some top-tier gamers
the scorpions gotta go or no no no we're
at a point
the the duck goes first or the
the duck the bunny goes first get out of
here you're stinky
roll me
could use a tiger maybe a tiger could do
some interesting stuff honestly i think
you could do worse than two scorpions
although a snake is kind of like your
classic there's no place for it to
really fit here if they run through your
crab
then your kangaroo's not going to have
the hp to get a snake to pop the flip
side of that is that
if they run through your crab your
kangaroo is going to die anyway so who
cares what you put in there i think you
roll as for now i think you roll a
second scorpion can you just can you
just just move a little bit to the side
there okay tomo is getting a little
crazy okay
you're getting into the chords i don't
like when you get into the chords
my office has been cleaned out of baby
stuff
there's so much room for activities
don't get near the computer
but if has warm why no sit i know okay i
was there when the law cats were
invented do not cite the old words to me
i was there when they were written
what do you think about this uh
nightmare squad
i've never been more sure of something
in my entire life
sanded
usually people keep their scalers in the
back let's ensure that we get to the
scalers
okay the problem is we still die in one
there
we had a good idea bad practice
i'll take my nine wins thank you very
much okay put me back in that was that
was a fun one i mean we the the start
was so insane
i was begging for another otter there
man that would have hit the spot this is
a great start though
be the gushing tentacles why not why not
right tomo after all why shouldn't i
have it
the 10 spot has eluded me a little bit
i'm a little surprised
we win these
but nine wins is still good still very
positive
two-two fits the bill
another fish toss another fish out here
honestly i i believe in our chances so
toss me a fish but then buy me a duck
instead of a cricket or like a one one
that scales like doo doo
i think we win this
i think we actually definitely lose this
what was i thinking we win this are you
stupid
the worst part is we lost to a duck
which means we got outplayed by somebody
who's just better than us
you definitely
just to be honest i think you sell first
then we buy buy
cell
is we're playing with fire okay don't
get me wrong
buy
and then you're going to think i lost my
mind
i'm going to sell my 3 4 to roll a duck
at the back is could it be could this be
the duck vindication i mean it's no 10
10 beaver on turn three or turn two
whatever it was but
let's see
let's see
great work great work
we uh we win these we win these and we
had two swans which means we got a great
economy coming up
um
maybe we don't roll crab this time i
know we've been rolling crab quite
prodigiously
it's round four you can definitely roll
a dog
so let's sell
let's buy
we're not going to be doing much selling
otherwise i would consider a shrimp
honestly
this is very nice okay so we're gonna
we need to combine
you know what i hate to say it you got
you forget the dog for now i know it it
gets triggered off of summon we need the
the plus one plus one applying to
anything is worth more now the least you
could have done is apply it to the dog
but so be it um on this one i'm a
believer in buy me
buff me sell me buff me buff me buff me
okay great work great work thank you so
much him me him him me um and then
a three-five does better
it just does better but a shrimp is more
fun so we're gonna put a shrimp out
there a little four or five action not
so bad six seven five six four seven
four five two one okay maybe if she's
five for three i think i've said that
joke before have i said that joke before
this is a full-on horse build also known
as uh praying that your opponent does
not have garlic armor they have a whale
this is interesting they might manage to
squeeze through here
we actually draw
um
if i had bought
the non-shrimp we would have won
but hey maybe the maybe the shrimp lets
us win more copium um
i'm going to be honest i love the otter
but its time has come and the fish is a
little statted better i understand i
understand okay
then the play is very simple
you're going to buy me
you're going to sell me
you're going to buy me
you're going to pill me
you're going to buy me
you're going to roll me
is turn five i i think we take our level
up here
on the other hand
i don't love it okay i don't love it but
why don't you go ahead and give me a
sell me
no
make your duck stronger freeze we're not
gonna hit level three on our fish forget
the bison you do this
you enjoy your duck being a two three
freeze me for a moment put the duck at
the back
five ten is fifteen let's do it like
this okay
um
we'll sell the duck next turn as far as
i'm concerned the duck stole a buff but
you never know what could happen nice
little badger build i'm always scared
going up against the badger build not
gonna deny that
there's no denial required i feel like
we got you though like we got you locked
in pretty tight here
anytime you win and you got a shrimp on
the squad you're feeling pretty solid so
the duck is going to be sold but i don't
think it's going to be sold yet because
these animals do not inspire me
now we will sell
even though i'm not inspired we need to
buy a dog here so we might as well get
it started you buy a dog you get buffed
we send you um i think you can
temporarily roll a kangaroo
we're really fishing for another dog
though
um
straight up as much as i love the
kangaroo
for the time being we're gonna say
excuse me we're gonna say goodbye
give a nice little shrimp buff there
we're gonna buy literally anything
um
then we're going to sell you
give us a nice little buff then we're
going to buy an otter
got a little 812 up at the front 814 dog
put the otter at the back
this is what you need to do if you're
scaling we're making hay while the sun's
up as long as we're still winning i
don't see a good reason to pivot from
this strat
but that could that could change in a in
a heartbeat as we all know
you almost had me there just kidding hey
pilly i saw we saw each other just a
second ago in game didn't we that takes
us to four wins
my language centers are you know
breaking as we speak and yet here we are
i hate to do this because you could
possibly level up the otter but you know
how it goes you get the buff on the cell
you get the buff on the buy and then the
buy or the summon then you get the buff
on the cell okay and we're feeling okay
straight up i just got to tell you a
pair is very good let's get a little
pair going on our dog here
you already know what time it is
one of those real quick quick
combination you know what
i think you could do worse than a
crocodile
as a as a noted member of the squad
um
and on turn seven i still like where my
head's at it's not it's not perfect and
everything in my body right now is
screaming at me to take a crab
we haven't seen one in a bit but
um
kangaroo's gonna be a touch spicy
actually is going to be totally fine
disregard what i just said
we're going to win easily against chip
dandy
takes us to five wins and and the
momentum is still rolling
the crocodile is not along for this
world i'm sorry to say thank you for the
buff cans are going to be nice we're
doing a lot of buying and selling so i i
respect the can
here's
look it's respectable but here's
something you can take for future
scaling you can just move your positions
around if you gotta
be honest with you food hits the spot
right now i'll also be honest with you
sheep i love you
see you later don't talk to me i'll talk
to you freeze me freeze me we're rolling
a skunk why i was enamored i was
enamored with the previous skunk that
destroyed my crab build
as a result we will use the skunk
ourselves
it's perfect timing
what
it's not perfect timing at all i was
ripped off
i was ripped off still one but like
i get it's in order of attack so your
skunk needs to have high attack to go
first which is understandable though it
annoys me
um
so anyway you're getting sold nice try
you really thought i was gonna keep you
around
we're gonna
it's tough
turtle's kind of sick you can get an
easy melon armor but melon armor at nine
is not as good as the garlic so you know
what i say to that i say no i say no to
this
i buy a can knowing i'm buying many
animals for the first time we buy a dog
i mean you can definitely
make this happen
you could definitely buy it on turn nine
you can buy a dragon um
roll once
freeze me you're starting to think about
like the possibility of selling this
fish but keeping the scampi and i think
that's idiotic i think you sell the
scampi it had its time in the sun it
helped us out a great deal you buy the
beaver the beaver buffs everything the
dog gets a double buff
we don't want to lose this one because
then we'll face harder teams in the
future but if if we do lose we got the
snail scaling we're not sweating it too
much
um that's a little a little nasty that's
a little nasty but we still we still own
here we still own
we still own okay i told you where all
we needed to do was free ourselves from
crab meta
although
[Laughter]
with that in mind hold on roll me
sell me
buy me
sell me
buy
me sell me
i'm telling you garlic's gonna be king
here buy me
straight up as much as i w as much as i
want the gold i think we'd do okay with
a combine there just to get some value
off the stats that's going to be a buy
me
we're going to follow that up with a
sell me
we're going to freeze the skunk and roll
once
i'm a simple man i got a fish we're
going to buy me freeze that turtle we're
probably getting to the point where it's
useful we're not going to combine yet
but we'll we got a level three fish
potentially like incoming so that was
like an insanely strong turn
that was very good that doesn't mean we
can't lose there are stronger turns
there's some strong gamers out here
today
we live which is insane which i mean if
you if you
destroy their hippo before it scales
you're probably going to win
so that takes us to eight wins
games getting tougher but i think we're
getting better at a faster speed
give me a combine
um
you got to think about this
because you don't you know i mean all
level three fish it's a nice scale and
this last spot is just a flex spot no
matter what
i want to see some level ones thank you
nice little level one there
roll me
love to see a level one
love to see you sell
me honestly just
toss me a turtle like right here then
freeze me a melon armor for the future
that can work too
what's great about this we basically
have like a two
team member squad okay now this is now
this is getting a little spicy although
i'm realizing now
your squad is also a two-member squad
but i'm you but stronger so this will
take us to
nine wins with a lot of hp to play
around with three hp to play around with
it's the dream
um i think for now we might as well hit
you with that that's that's a good
economy for us i gotta tell you turtle
that your time is not now we're gonna
take a nice little scaling factor here
roll me so i'm fortunate
roll me garlic could do something for us
it's a little unfortunate this is
unfortunate you're going to roll me i
just want to see some tier ones this is
beautiful we should this is order we did
this in a bad order
freeze the monkey we got so much bass to
play with i don't mind freezing a monkey
here
i don't know i i got my squad like it's
not even in the right order i'm just i'm
sending it as fast as i can send it and
yet i'm loving it i do i do i do fear
the rooster i think i've criminally
underrated the rooster but i i mean
you're done
incompetent
i get it funny very funny
we're back in the saddle that's a 9 10
video right there we'll go back to pay
to win next time but thanks for watching
hope you enjoyed it i'll see you next
time see ya



all right we're back with sap we got a
little time to think about it the sap
500 has now opened up
um will now get the six wins or more you
know how it is
play arena we're on free to play
we're on free to play
we're popping out the casino we're
looking at our first shop
i think i've struggled recently with the
fact that i overrate the otter slightly
even though the otter is really good
um but this is an okay shop i think you
start ants
i think you freeze
otter
roll once get a fish and then try your
50 50.
it's better to be lucky than good this
this is like an a minus first turn i
respect that
let's be the uh
i'll be the the subtle masseuses it's
like you don't even know they're there
please help chib out
jib you want a shout out or something is
that what's happening here
jimmycus jamesicus the panicking piggies
there you go
easy wins easy wins
pog pog
i mean the guy was rolling a duck what
was he thinking right so you can
definitely roll this
now the question imo would be would you
rather
um take a a beaver and then try for
something on the roller would you rather
freeze a beaver and try for something on
the roll or would you mean
honestly i think i'd rather to win i
think you'd rather take a mosquito
slotted in right there roll once it's
terrible luck quite frankly we're gonna
we're gonna apply a buff to our fish
anytime you find yourself buying apple
um
on turn two that's a little bit of a
sleeper hit the ant please
sorry it happens it happens
big plays
big plays
absolutely wonderful plays we win these
all right
okay this is not so bad we're gonna
combine ants
we're gonna sell our 2-2 mosquito thanks
for being here
we're going to buy a dog because it's
round three
we're going to buy an otter trigger the
dog combine me you can think about an
elephant but it's kind of small ball i'm
not i'm not a small ball gamer
give me a freeze and a roll oh baby
um honestly straight up
freeze that whole dang shop i'm a happy
man i'm not calling 3-0 here but uh
but definitely we're looking okay for
the future i i have you gotta respect it
man you gotta respect that they're
trying to make a bird work and they're
gonna beat us this round respect
they get they got that bird self-buffing
massive respect this is unbelievable um
start me with a combine
it's a little messed up
because you want to get the summon
trigger but not on the otter because the
otter has to be combined first that's
beautiful that's beautiful then give me
one of these
that's a straight up
then give me uh one of these up at the
very
front
next turn will be turn five
i'll be very happy to see it it's an
interesting layout we got here
badgers hello ludwig viewers
nice to see you thanks for sticking
around for a little bit after some some
bros v bros
i i did see ludwig's
his badger build
it tickled me and then when he got 10
wins i was in the chat saying pog just
like everyone else
it's a very simple
combine i don't know i kind of i snooze
on that just a little bit straight up
you just buy yourself a place in the
squad okay now you can start to think
about like crab meat here it can do
something it's a very well-rounded squad
i'd be i'd be open to freezing this
honestly like don't don't shoot the
messenger okay
six seven fish
get sold
get bought
get sold
get bought
really need that dog level up soon
probably should not have uh an apple
frozen at this point but but it's where
we're at
it's what i deserve
so far so good so far so good baby
we win these
it puts us on four wins okay
not an amazing shop we know we're going
combine here
but a 9 8 ant at the front
it's an acceptable buy sell if you want
to if you want to get freaky it's an
acceptable buy so i'll take that
take one of these
unfreeze that apple
straight up i'm gonna i'm gonna play it
very simple here a bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush
give me some guaranteed stats scary and
scary dog
i'm i'm somewhat unprepared
i'm markedly unperturbed i'm not scared
in the slightest ball sniffer
all right there's there's five wins one
more for the believers
getting pretty close to buy swell by
cell like i appreciate our swan but it's
probably time for you to go probably put
some garlic on this dog real quick
definitely this is the
play then i'm honestly i'm a pretty
simple man after that i think you buy a
a worm and sell it
and then you make your uh your ant even
scarier you run a full squad marty or a
four squad marty
hmm
hmm spider melon oh that's nat that
dolphin's a little nasty huh
nasty little dolphin freak
okay we live
we live
we live
we win these
easy money
takes us to six
feeling pretty good
people are gonna be like order but this
is not order in order to do this
properly you got to put the otter in the
combination combinatorics you can't do
the combine afterwards you need the plus
two plus two
you want meat on your crab
give me a quick freeze roll me
honestly kangaroo behind crab is kind of
like
avengers end game status here
oh it's a nasty team
now this is a nasty squad
okay okay
we live which is unbelievable that that
changes the game for us in a big way we
win these
didn't freeze crab crab doesn't benefit
from the extra levels that much i would
rather feed a i would rather feed the
thing in front of the uh the crab
instead whenever possible okay so here's
the deal like i gotta be honest otter
you've done well but your time on the
island has come to an end
thanks for being here
we're on level nine that's perfect quick
little summon here
level three
ants
we don't sweat those
welcome to the squad
gorilla imo not that good hmm
okay yeah all right um
we definitely want a level two dog
i think for the time being
let me freeze both of those too
hmm i think for the time being
you just summon a scorpion for the front
try something like this
this squad has 10 win potential great
start that's a great start
dude this is just sad at this point like
when your whole squad loses to a level
one ant at the front like come on
what's the problem here that's seven
wins
now scorpion i'd be happy to buy you
again
but not yet
don't make me laugh
here i'm a simple man buy me a sheep
drop me a sheep
buy me a monkey
pass the turn
next step would be um
garlic on the kangaroo level three
turtle how about that though
level three turtle kind of nasty that's
that's a great counter mango ipa great
respect
screwed up the crab order
how'd you get back there
no wait no this is fine
no this is not fine i'm very stupid
okay um
you can roll like see you later you can
definitely roll a tiger behind the
kangaroo for double scaling purposes
it's an easy buy sell
dump rat jesse what the hell are you
talking about
i don't wish to replace my shop with
food
we need to get the six gold so we're
gonna do a dodo buy
thanks for the hp we're gonna put a
tiger on the squad we're gonna freezer
kangaroo for our next turn
smell and armor pretty nasty
pretty nasty we live through those
this is a disaster though are you seeing
this
okay we're getting kind of dusted on
on scaling here
let's think about this
i'm still i'm a buy sell man i'm a buy
sell sort of guy
get this uh get this dog powered up a
little bit more hp is always better
i'm gonna be straight up with you you
you buy the duck
you sell the duck and then you use the
parrot as a surrogate crab which does
not ruin your kangaroo
this is a bold strategy don't get me
ready and they're rolling a meta squad
but i think garlic does okay here oh
it's a level two turkey though
bit of a five head turn that ox scares
the crap out of me
oh that's that's not great
that's not great
all right well we'll settle for eight
that's not too bad
choose outcome pay out the believers on
that one bit of a fun one maybe got a
little bit goofy going for the dog
scaling long term
will you try hunting for achievements at
some point i mean maybe but like i don't
know it just doesn't seem that fun to
like have 8 000 people laughing at me
for trying to get like a level 3 spider
or something you know what i mean
i would rather just uh
just enjoy myself and try to win
it seems it seems really tedious to go
for achievements quite frankly like
like i i really don't have any interest
in trying to get like a level three uh
crab or a level three owl or a level
three rat
i think i'd rather just like play the
game
just look at the d tier imagine having
to carry all of them
okay it's good it's decent
it's fine
i give this a c-plus but in a good way
um
maybe the soft
soft bushes that's perfect
how many episodes deep are you and isaac
and you're talking about tediousness so
true so true
he's just like me for real
okay you can roll double ants here
that's a slap in the face um
two ants can get this done though a
little a little ant luck
i mean we're rolling against pigs and
ducks so i'm not sweating that
i think that's a you're gonna be scary
next year for now i'll take my free win
certainly an interesting situation
i think you get crazy combine your ants
buy a scampi sell a beaver don't hit the
other beaver thank you so much
sell the other beaver yet again
okay this is it it's a unique scampi
opportunity
sadly i think we
are
kind of forced into this
i'll take a mosquito and a spider
they'll sell a mosquito
play a
hedgehog it's not a great start so far
it's like the the shops have been a
little scuffed
that's nasty
i don't know how that is quite frankly
i i feel very good that we traded with
the ants but we're hoping for something
like sheep sheep sheep giraffe is not
what we needed uh we draw these that's
fine that's fine
it's not so bad
um
we're gonna need to level up at some
point but for now i think get out of my
face i hate you
thank you get out of my face i hate you
i can't pill a 3-7 i was going to but i
don't i don't think i can man
don't laugh at this
okay
order
i don't want to roll the dog long term
we don't have to roll the dog long term
but we kind of gotta roll it for now
and you know what freezer meat that's
that's a high value
saved
not saved we there's no way we kill this
fish at the end
there's no world in which this fish does
not kill us
this guy's name is scared and hard he
must be once you naked and afraid
okay one one
you start to think about something here
the elephant didn't do enough for us it
it failed at its only job
you know
i think it's time for the scampi to get
out of here
thank you for for almost doing your part
and then i'm gonna roll like i'm gonna
roll like the craziest squad you've ever
seen
something like that
i'm gonna roll two sheep for the time
being
which will give our dog many many
summon triggers
let's go so we've got such good ant luck
lately
i don't know if this is good or bad for
us that elephant is gonna live forever
you peace
i'm gonna go ahead and say uh bad for us
yeah bad for us
have you given your expert take on the
uh new patch notes i haven't yet i
haven't i've seen the test build i see
that it has like a 2x speed
which is i'm very excited about
that's like the the biggest improvement
that they could have
they could have put in the game imo
we're running like the exact same build
we did last time there is a difference
though we got so much more hp this time
you can definitely if you wanted to go
crazy
like i know this is not going to be a
popular take
no that's not how you do it whale whales
yesterday's tomatoes man
i'm doing it anyway
and to give us the best chance of
winning
i don't mind losing one ram summon i
don't want to lose the stats on the ants
you peace
well turns out on this one i'm not sure
how much impact it would have had garlic
just craps on the rams
oh the amp trades saved saved not saved
saved
saved we win these
and you all doubted me
and you all doubted me
i mean it's pretty much a given like
you need the support if you're gonna do
anything
um
you could definitely
straight up like get out of my face you
suck
then you go here
and then you go here freeze me freeze me
roll me freeze me freeze me we'll deal
with you we'll deal with you later we'll
deal with you later
nice try
still pretty bad not gonna lie to you
dude imagine like playing pay to win and
thinking you have any chance to be free
to play like come on
okay
you will be leaving the squad
you will be leaving the squad
we will be moving our dog to position
one
playing two monkeys
buffing our dog
rolling once
you know what with three gold for now
that's the play
1723 garlic armor dog round eight
there's a chance no scorpions that we
are we're deep in scorpion territory
this blows up your kangaroo build we're
pretty lucky
that's a big win
323 kind of stinky source dude just
trust me um
probably i would say
goodbye fish it's been nice hope you
find your paradise
those definitely you're gonna give me
one of those i mean that's like that's a
gimme
i'm gonna keep that turtle frozen for
for a minute here we're gonna freeze
this we're really looking for meat
as we did not receive meats
i will take my level
okay yeah
yeah
now we really only have a dog
so you got to be a little
what the hell
whoa we're amazing
we still lose but that's kind of amazing
okay what are we on one life we still
got a scaling potential here this is not
bad
genuinely this is okay
um
you just got to think about how you want
to set it up
it's going to be like
we're going to have to combine
we don't need to buy the dog yet
that can come later because he's not
going to get here quite yet
then you're going to buy one of these
roll me
it's pretty bad
pretty bad
well okay
for now i'm a believer but no meat on
the crab is kind of is deleterious
no meat still
i was very much looking forward to the
meat
because i thought even i would sell the
cat
and the level one monkey to get meat on
the crab right now
alas
this is where we stand it's in god's
hands now 34 40 dog no scorpion please
no scorpion
i see no scorpion i see no dodo
i feel i feel okay but none of our
creatures have any attack
thank god you didn't have a b we lived
okay we need another unit that does
something
um and we need it fast
i think you still keep the dog we
desperately needed that meat thank you
thank you
thank you finally
i'm scared
because i'm scared
i'm gonna try
what we might describe as a bit of a
hail mary
i would say that that did not work out
the way i intended but i'm i'm sort of
feeling like okay
yeah yeah okay we win these
that takes us to five
that's definitely getting sold
you don't need a dog anymore you're not
along for this world okay
snake is really good
you can definitely roll a snake
more than anything else i mean a second
snake would be sick we would also not
mind melon armor
okay that's um
this is our this is our believer shot
and we take our believer shot in this
household
four squad marty at number 12.
they're rolling a full four squad marty
as well as well
yo we definitely win these
okay that takes us to seven we made it
or six sorry we made it to the believer
threshold
one thing that's kind of disgusting you
can do is counter play
scorpions put a [ __ ] unit at the front
to block a scorpion then in front of
your best unit
toss a scorpion that will take out their
good unit and this this is just like
basically this is like a big fu
um
on round 13
i'm melon a dog over a snake but i would
like another melon for the snake if
possible
that's that's non-negotiable let's try
something like this for now okay let's
let's see if my counterpick works here
is actually like the exact opposite on
the other hand
we still own you
yeah yeah we still own you get owned
you're owned
you're also owns
no sweat okay so that's seven
obviously we want to put a tiger on the
squad
okay the monkey
is going bye-bye
it's in god's hands now and i accept
that
if they melon at the front
all you can really say about that is
well played
it's what i would do too
sure
okay i see i see you played this game
before it's an interesting team there's
a lot of melon armor
melon armor would be spooky if it wasn't
uh so useless for you here that takes us
to eights
one up on the scorpion would anyone like
to explain why this is the worst play in
the game
you can stake a snake but i'd rather
just have melon honestly
i i don't know if i've ever seen
anything like this before
this is eight wins i mean round 15 is is
a little scary
okay very similar squads that that
rooster is gonna be a a nightmare
please oh no it's over it's over
the the dodo
rooster combo is really good that's
that's like a i would maybe put that up
there at like the top of the meta right
now like a level two level three dodo
plus a rooster is like it's very very
good but hey that's another believer
payout
it's another believer payout
let's run it back i'm having a good time
on free to play for now um this is this
is okay
you can roll an ant mosquitoes cracked
in the early game
i don't fully understand why not level
up tiger or crab they their benefits uh
they don't get any extra abilities from
leveling up so when you buy another one
of them and combine you only get plus
one attack and plus one defense which in
the late game in particular is pretty
much useless like you know the the worst
piece of equipment is an apple and an
apple gives plus one plus one to a unit
of your choice crab is basically like
that when you buy another crab um or
tiger as well so essentially like it's a
worse apple because you have to apply it
to
the unit of which it matches
basically they have no scaling
this is a losing squad round one
crab needs more attack anyway that's why
you either you know get a dodo or
alternatively you just buy uh meat and
then for three you're getting five uh
attack and then every time that you live
through an attack which will happen many
times if you've got it behind a unit
with high hp you're adding five to each
one it could do like 20 extra damage per
turn
um let's be the delicious cakes that's
just perfect
this looks pretty bad but it's not
unexpected
though we're actually going to draw this
which is kind of cracked
please feed your crabs more attack
because the 850 is kind of bad
instead of feeding the crabs
you feed the unit in front of the crab
as a result
the hp feeds back to the crab and every
time it makes it over a threshold of the
next opponent's attack it does double
damage
alternatively instead of investing more
into your crab attack you could just
invest in like a kangaroo behind it
which every time the crab gets to attack
which is going to do about 17 times
is going gonna add like plus one plus
two plus one plus two plus one plus two
plus one plus two plus one plus two you
gotta think multiplicatively like honest
i'm just being honest with you if you
spend all your gold leveling up a crab i
look forward to never seeing you pass
like round eight because your ass is
getting grounded to a fine pace by the
current meta
it's going nowhere
yeah you're talking to the guy who
i wouldn't say i
was the progenitor of the crab
meta
but i definitely had a role in
popularizing it okay
just get ready
now maybe if you level up
well basically buff your crab because
the level doesn't matter but if you buff
your crab
early
and then as a result you win more than
you draw
then maybe it can be the play to add a
little extra attack to your crab early
but i think it's far from a
generalization
now let's think about this
i don't care if you buff an ant
so let's buy a fish
incepted
look now you gotta think with your brain
okay
um
honey no
honey
are you insane
a two
a 4-2 ant is not going to defeat
anything it's still going to die to
their first unit they're never going to
put a one attack unit first it would
live through a mosquito attack who cares
i think what you do instead is you toss
yourself
a 1-1 mosquito that's one away from
leveling up
you don't need the extra
you know one snipe early dude we got
super lucky like that was that was great
math for us we take your fish we take we
we win these we win these easily
i'm telling you early early game i'm
cracked late game i start to fall apart
a little bit early game i'm a little
cracked
it's a terrible start um
however
you guys like getting like freaky nasty
because you can sell an otter
buy a dodo
and then pray
that's okay
that's what we wanted to see
and then
that's just necessity is the mother of
invention
it's not a dream squad but it's it's
something maybe we can think about a
rooster later
you never know
i do wonder how we're getting through
that peacock
and i think the answer is that we are
we're gonna draw we draw these that's
incredible
very lucky but i'll take it
this is good stuff man
so we don't need to summon we can do
this we don't care for a sheep obviously
we'll be buying a dodo
roll me once
sell me
i think you want to get freaky here
i think you want to put an ant at the
front
hope it trades
and then pill it next turn to affect
your dodo i'm getting i'm going crazy
i'm going crazy
what the heck it's the same squad
this is pretty bad
yeah this is a loss
dude honestly a rap might have been the
play there a rat might have made the
difference
now
sell the mosquito we're getting very
spicy here but
that's very nice okay
now we need nine gold
nine gold you can
a crab can be a reasonable part of the
squad
turtle
a little bit of pill for the future and
you're not gonna like this freeze the
duck
i'm gonna meet this crab
i'm gonna roll a sec oh you [ __ ]
still
i wouldn't mind losing this losing this
one will be fine we scale our dodo we
get a rooster later
okay it's big melon
summon some garbage
this is pretty bad for us this this will
probably go down as another loss
this will definitely go down as another
loss but that's good we get a snail
well it's not good but it's not that bad
um snail me
i mean dodomi snail me
we don't need to peel you just yet
you're going to get the melon armor
regardless
sell me i'm going to roll for something
beautiful
i mean straight up is it's hard to argue
with starting to stat the fish a little
bit with some levels
so i think what you do is you freeze a
fish roll once
buy an otter hits the dodo
that's not so bad that's not so bad
pill spider how to spend four gold
getting a snail
doubters love him
this does not seem great either
hold on i'm wrong it's amazing
and we haven't even begun to peak yet
okay so this is a gimme um
you get pilled
you get purchased
you get bots
honestly you're kind of like you're in
nine eight you're kind of freaky in your
own right
freeze you for a second just for a
moment for a moment like this
we're on round seven
i think we roll this
for the time being put some garlic on
your next turn
you got the same amount of hp i'd rather
get you popping although never mind
because your melanoma i think makes you
superior for this round
okay
six nine
nice of course but i don't expect you to
get a kill quite frankly
but i do okay i think we've done things
in the proper order we did not waste our
dodo bonus
dodo bonus confirmed not wasted we win
these
we're really looking for a rooster like
a rooster is the ultimate play
you're gonna need some garlic
start to think about popping the crab
behind you
it's a little strange but always wonder
like the thing is a dodo in the middle
or like a a hippo in the middle always
seems kind of interesting however
um
you ruin the potential to wipe their
whole squad which always feels good so
let's hit you with one of those honestly
here i'm a salad man it's not what you
want to see necessarily but at least the
dodo got a nice little buff
squad's a bit freaky
hold on we don't live through the fish
uh we there's there's no chance we win
this one
we draw that
okay
so the fish can go what i want to
replace it with though
is a
a second level one
monkey well well
don't invest in a can there it's
unnecessary
a little chocolate
so a level two monkey does the same
thing as two level ones so i'm just
gonna be straight up with you
you play it that way i'm i respect this
it would be nice for the hippo to have
more attack but i think it's scaling
just fine right now
we live through your peacock
oh it's lev oh no it's fine that means
we live through your kangaroo we do not
live through
your bison or your buffalo but who cares
that's a wind that takes us to four
i'm loving this scaling more than a
dragon a dragon doesn't scare me i'm
keeping the chocolate around we don't
have to make a commitment here yet
i'm more than willing to spend a little
bit of gold here hey i sleep
you could roll
is is tight
but you could combine your monkeys by
chocolate throw in a penguin and then
instead of getting
4 4 on you
we would get 4 4 on u
and then
plus one plus one on everything
and we'd have a flex everything but the
crab and yourself and we would have a
flex space i'm gonna do it
i would not describe myself as a
long-term believer in the strat but i
think for where we're at in the game is
kind of sick
this looks pretty good
crab dodo i don't think i've had the
pleasure to run it since the
since the meta swap or since the the
patch
well that's a win
that takes us to five
anytime i see a parrot i'm like i'm both
scared and not scared
roll me i i have no long-term attachment
to a penguin
now i think the garlic's to play for the
time being so honestly penguin get out
of my face
we're gonna override the melon i don't
think it's that necessary just yet
i don't even need to freeze you if
you're like if you show up later i'll be
happy to see you that's about it though
um
roll me again
this is just a simple imo
but imo the right animal selection
matters so much more
than like oh you could have had like a
couple of extra sushis
rolled past the rooster
muscle memory muscle memory
okay hold on
it still looks good we can we can redeem
ourselves
nice crab just kidding
okay that's six that's the believer
payout
remember if you see a rooster
get a rooster
i could be persuaded i could be
persuaded there and then honestly a
little
a little wide scaling
i'll live with that i'll live with that
spooky not spooky enough though
it's kind of weird to like eat a
scorpion but
it's it's clever and i respect the
cleverness of it
not clever enough to avoid the death
though
that's seven
saving it for later
honestly like
i do love an apple
tiger dodo is kind of cracked but i
really want to get like a rooster with
it or something i think i can freeze you
for the time being we're getting late
enough i'd rather have melon than garlic
just go ahead and become a 39 42 for us
and then you know what
oh no my tiger
oops
why do you have meat on a 50 46 because
he's been around since like turn two and
i'm a ride or die sort of dude
so that that meat probably got us four
wins by itself and now people are
looking at it like hey
you know what it is it's like you're
looking at my my childhood room and
going like why you got size eight shoes
in here because i [ __ ] had size eight
feet at one point in my life dummy
now i got size 13s if i had a time
machine it would make it on the list
don't buy so many size 8 shoes
okay we could roll the bunny but it's
not necessary
for now we can do this
okay well then get combined that's the
beauty of some combining
you're almost maxed
why i'm telling you people they they get
too attached to their animals man
they're too afraid to like sell
something and then
buy another one back later like if you
got a little tiger you could just sell a
tiger and then buy it back later
there's an opportunity cost
look
the right play here
my opinion
you get a skunk
and you hope that you wipe somebody with
this skunk here it's good oh oh it's
gonna take like 17 hp off here two
scorpions is a bold play there's a bold
play
unfortunately for you we win these nice
try
takes us to nine
get out of my face
you're gonna scale the max anyway you're
you're pretty much maxed so i think the
food is not that relevant
this is the thinking man's
endeavor really now a tiger behind
something could work in theory
like
the problem is a tiger behind a hippo
breaks your chain here so i'm going to
say that that's non-functional
um
you should take some melon that's a big
helper
and what we have we have two lives to
play with okay if we have two lives to
play with
here's the thing like you don't really
need to triple the damage you're doing
just the double that you're doing is
giving us a lot
that being said
that's not they should put it there come
on that monkey's not doing anything
[Laughter]
okay this melon is juiced man
not juiced enough
great i i can't even be mad that's just
a great team
their scorpion was freaking cracked
one more shot here
must have been a viewer giant scorpion
is sick i love a giant scorpion
what gives us the best chance of winning
let's find the team okay
first things first we want something
else at the front to counter a scorpion
existing
mission accomplished
then
i actually cannot think of an animal
that would fit nicely here which
probably means that the animal that
would fit best is a scorpion just before
our hippo so i'm gonna roll
the only thing that matters to me we're
gonna give i know we're giving something
up here okay we're gonna give up a lot
of opportunity cost but we're going to
do i see the level 3 dodo this is what i
mean we're rolling it all out because
the thing that affects my chances the
most
is a scorpion with a stake on it
now rooster is just a little too late we
don't have the time to level it this is
almost guaranteed to be our last round
we're not going to get a scorpion with
steak
so as a now with steak that's right
because
it overrides the scorpion's poison
i almost had you there
what about a monkey with steak
please
ladies and gentlemen
okay
here's the way you play this okay
scorpion second
so their scorpion trades with our monkey
our scorpion kills the unit they were
protecting with their scorpion
and then our hippo goes buckwild on the
rest of them
okay this is still good because we break
their melon armor with our trash unit no
all right we still hold on we're still
we kill you
we live we kill you we kill you we oh
you're toast you suck sorry great good
game um
10 wins all right
choose outcome another believer win we
got time for one more we got time for
one more quick one
start me up will now get to six wins or
more this is this will be our final
attempt
it's the final countdown
i do have to say bear taffy just sent me
a link to a multiplication test
worksheet
and said print out five of these next
stream let's do a b05
that could be fun that could be fun
i don't know if my ego could deal with
uh
with losing
uh that that
i'll just have to practice all weekend
okay
i i want i'll tell you what
if we pay out the believers
this is for all the marbles if we pay
out the believers on this run
i will buy spooky forest background for
five thousand
if we pay out the doubters i will spend
five thousand points on golden poop even
though i will never wear it
i will waste 30 hours
of in-game currency i'll just burn it
it's not a horrible start it's not a
great start but it's not a horrible
start
what the heck is a sedin
be the cheesy citizens
thank you
we draw these we draw these
okay we've only got eight minutes too
holy bursh i keep the shooters on me
are you kidding me okay this is a a rare
situation where i find it actually
slightly amenable to roll a duck knowing
that we're gonna be able to go plus one
plus one on a tier three unit next turn
daniel or henrik i mean that's the why
don't you just ask me like
you know
which of my parents i i love more right
like that's a tough question
i i've always been a henrik guy i've got
the henrik jersey with the c
patch i always considered myself more of
a an assister instead of a scorer but
you gotta respect daniel's nose for the
goal
it's pretty sick
you might be mad by the way but duck imo
is the best play there
even the worst thing in this game can
still be good on occasion
now what what the heck is most likely to
stick around here
the the kangaroo needs more hp
as does whatever's going to be in front
of it so i'm going i'm going in hard
here for just a sec i'm going in a
little hard
i would say
even though it's a little spiced you can
definitely roll a swan next turn this is
not an incredible start though
love it
oh what it still works just kidding i
knew that
lovely
literally doesn't matter we win these
okay we need a spicy unit
to pog up
we need to sell you buff a strong unit
okay the fish gets sold why
well it's a level one with no buffs then
we buy this ergo the swan stands a good
chance to take this buff
if it goes to the flamingo i'll survive
look that's beautiful this actually
might manage to live a little longer
than expected then you do a little chain
here
you're gonna have the crab behind the
mosquito
you need to roll one time
the crabs gonna need the meat i'm gonna
freeze you just in case like this is not
incredible still
that's that's just acceptable freeze
donkey kong acceptable freeze
there's some irony there but i'm not
sweating it it's a nasty we're not in a
great spot on this team honestly we're
not getting the dreams yet
okay it's all about that dog at the back
basically need our kangaroo to pop off
uh it's totally fine
i would shouldn't have even been scared
mobster bisque great name by the way
great name
okay
admittedly melon on something in front
of the kangaroo would be nice but we
can't afford to take this away from the
crab so i think you have to buff the
for now the mosquito's sticking around
but that's not likely to be the case
long term but for time being
i think this is your play the crab
already has good attack you get more hp
we could just put a turtle in front of
you and then
i'm not sold on it yet
that's kind of a sick play
they're really throwing me for a loop
here man like
i'll freeze it i'll freeze it how many
flamingos have we seen in the shop like
this is getting no no no no no no it's
getting a little insane i i think our
shops have been truly god-awful
it runs the risk of creating serious
problems for me later
for now it's okay later
we may find ourselves running into a
little conundrum
okay
our kangaroo beats your kangaroo
and then you peace
could not connect to the server cancel
the bet
this might be a necessary freeze
i don't believe in a level 2 turtle yet
not yet
okay this i do believe in i believe in
this
and i believe in
this
and i believe in rolling until we get a
dream this might be our dream for now
though it brings me no great pleasure
we're on turn six with like no scaling i
i see myself buying golden poop right
now it scares the crap out of me man
thank you thank you crab difference i
see myself having to buy some golden
poop we might be okay on this round but
we got to get something going
like as soon as pot we need a monkey we
need a monkey as soon as possible
preferably two monkeys
that's not a monkey can't really do that
much with the with the penguin right now
um
but we got extra gold so like i hate to
do this but we gotta buff a mosquito
that's a scary thought
this is one of the rare situations where
i might think about buying a can
and then i'll freeze a penguin just in
case we oh
oh
try to be best because you're only a man
and a man's gotta learn to stake it
history i can't hit those notes okay now
you gotta just use your noggin for a
second um
look i love swans man i do
my only question is let's walk it
through what do we get if we have a so a
monkey is going to buff our mosquito
two-two every turn we could also get an
extra one one by having a penguin if we
were
open to selling both swans i think we
have to make up for lost time on scaling
i'm gonna freeze you that's a that's a
little just in casey
that makes sense
this is not great this is basically like
a slightly better giraffe but
hello ludwig i i every time look i've
this is probably the opposite of how it
is for most people but your
uh super auto pets content has gotten me
in the crab game
like i come for the super auto pets i
stay for the
for the open mic
50 streamer lobby screaming crab game
the floor is lava and i find myself
pogging i i genuinely sincerely do
look we're looking okay here give me one
of these give me one of these roll into
a penguin or a monkey
it's okay life goes on give me one of
those
that rooster oh it's a turkey build
turkey loses pretty hard to garlic
though
holy crap
are crabs only gonna get uh to buff the
kangaroo two times
i don't know i feel okay about this
i feel like i feel like we beat their
horse with our penguin that's huge
so we only need one more win to not have
to buy golden poop
that's good
that's good
this is like our emergency deploying in
case of emergency honestly i think you
keep the snail frozen
i'm just gonna freeze the whole damn
shop if that's okay with you
um
i mean literally the penguin is just
better than the monkey though it pains
me to say
so here's the way we're gonna try it for
now
please
sell crab
have you been paying attention
this will be on the test later
dude we're not gonna we're not gonna
have to buy the golden poop
this is one of those things only real
super auto pets gamers are gonna
understand
but genuinely
that the first four turns that we were
playing here should have led to a loss
quite frankly
we we managed to pull ourselves ever so
slightly at least out of the muck
for which i'm very appreciative because
this was like this was close okay we
gotta we gotta go a little faster
as we've established i'm a wife guy my
wife is streaming soon give me one of
those honestly dude you're hold on hold
on hold on all of a sudden there's six
extra attack on your crab now we're
feeling great
interesting oh that could have been that
could have gone different man that could
have gone different okay this i mean
golden poop congrats
or whatever
we lose these we take that we we escaped
that
what are we on six six wins i think we
can push it a little further i'm not
sure how much but i think we could push
it a little further don't need melon on
snake yet it's good but it's not good
yet
nope
this doesn't really do much on the crab
honestly we freeze it i wouldn't mind
applying it to a snake but it's got to
be the right circumstance
you're not scaling fast enough for me
anymore i guess we're just going to roll
and do nothing how does that how does
that strike you
rolling for no purpose
should have frozen the cupcake honestly
all right
well it's in god's hands now
i don't fear this yet
don't kill my crab
lovely i don't fear this
i don't fear this
that takes us to seven
round twelve buff me dude we gotta hit
the snake it's so much more important on
the snake we're rolling for basically
tiger and and snake so that's huge
honestly like i think you're a piece
get out of here if we're not gonna find
a tiger i was gonna say give me cat
cupcake but that's not how that goes
you know what at least you're a 1011.
that was a misplay i'll all own up to
that
tiger tiger no tiger no tiger no tiger
okay well we win these
this looks a little nasty
that's this is a loss even with the
penguin just to be clear
this team is just nasty
hey there's seven wins the believers get
paid out again
and true to my my bargain here true to
my bargain here
finally customize backgrounds
i mean so here's the thing i know i said
i was going to buy
um
scary forest but lava mountain is just
cooler and it's november so we're not in
halloween season anymore
i'm going to buy lava mountain just
because it looks cooler i will spend 5
000 points
and then
backgrounds
lava mountain
there you go
let's go



everybody we are back let's say it's
unfair to stay on pay to win
put me on on or on free to play put me
on pay to win where things are a little
bit touchier a little trickier and we
start immediately with a very quizzical
shop
i am oh here's how i'd play this okay i
think you gotta accept sometimes the
shop is in your favor sometimes it isn't
yikes um and you you hope for a bad team
will be the improper pants like you wore
khakis but it was actually like it was
business formal and they're like what
are you doing in those chinos and you're
like i didn't know
um
i don't know i don't know how this
shakes out
i think we uh
lose these but i kind of knew it was
coming and i i blame a lot of it on our
shop quite frankly like is you know you
can't control for every variable i do i
like this
i
why did i turn into the survivor theme
song uh let's get weird with it no
because you you sell four
uh four if i combine you you only sell
for two
yeah okay okay i'm gonna create
a slightly better ants to help our
economy and just being realistic we're
angling for a draw of course a win would
be awesome if we could get it
the ant getting ko does not for the best
that's beautiful though i think honestly
i think we win these now
just mosquito luck paid out in our favor
a little bit and uh now we can start to
build a squad that you know she told you
not to worry about
so we'll start with a combined good unit
very interesting unit very very
interesting unit
i got to think about this okay i think
we're going to be stuck with the pigs a
little while longer
which means we should probably stick
with the ant a little while longer i
think we got a role
for a team of some merit
honestly
this is the dang squad right now
it's very unusual but i don't i want a
seller pig i do not want the ant to buff
the pig so i don't want to peel the ant
until i sell the pig which means we got
some work to do
that feels nice
that does not feel nice
we lose these
not unexpected i do not fear the golden
poop anymore by the way it's just
you know it plays out the way it plays
out now if i buy you for three
we can then sell a unit for three but we
get the level up in the process
and if we don't have to sell you are a
4-4 so we kind of like that um
we need a unit that scales and the
answer to this question right now is
none of them let's see how this goes
and i i knew that was a possibility now
congratulations you've just become our
scalar so take a little hp
thanks i really appreciate it okay
uh we don't need to freeze a cupcake we
need to find a way to get you to scale
i think you do this for economy purposes
i think it's just slightly too late for
a dog plus we rolled one last time i
don't know about this 3-4 in front of a
3-5 with meat kind of seems a little bit
busted like in a bad way
that's that's nasty this is nasty
we lose these and we start to think
about our lives now like we're not
living long enough for a caterpillar to
pop with one hp left so you got to think
about things a bison is a hit
um it doesn't hit yet
but in if we can just live for a few
turns
it gets there i think we have to take i
don't know if we have to take it right
now but i think we got to take it in
general um
i think it's
garlic would would be sick
straight up you gotta roll a snail mate
uh oh geez louise but what do i sell to
make that happen
well we're not gonna lose the next round
you don't need it
are you really gonna sell a pig with
meat to get a snail out there i'm not no
the answer is no i'm not what we're
going to do is we're going to get a
bunny out there in place of the fish
next turn which means we're going to be
very happy we need a cupcake next turn
then as well let's roll me one time a
bat is always beautiful but not on the
squad not on this squad
this would be a bit of an upset to lose
with a team that's this okay this early
i'm looking at this squad this squad
does not frighten me we seem to trade
with them quite nicely
now i'm feeling okay we barely won but
we held it
okay we just need this this bison to get
poppin
you get sold
straight up i know we should be buffing
you maybe but like you're gonna need the
buffs longer term which is why
we're making an investment right now
this is a very good potential investment
right here
stick you up there a little bit further
ahead grab me one of those
uh we can absolutely
start the time when this thing's about
to pop we can start to think about
selling this pig
rolling three bunnies and buffing the
crap out of the bisons hp
but we need to live
through at least this round and maybe
the next if we don't get a caterpillar
in the shop always a little bit
perturbed
when i see a kangaroo here
um
however can i tell you something
we at least
kill it on the pig and then we own you
okay
so now this is the real proof of concept
i don't talk to me right now
how much do you believe in me because i
i'm i'm believing in the me that
believes in me
selling the swan might be a little bit
too much but
i need permanent buffs man i need
permanent buffs
these are not permanent buffs
and literally any fruit would do it for
me
freeze me a salad i don't want to have
to take the chance okay we're taking the
chance
that hurts that that hurts although a
612 is kind of sick i think we probably
lose this and will go down as one of the
greatest uh whiffs in super auto pets
history
but i don't want to lose it
we you peace honestly like
there's no way there's no way you make
it out of this they didn't even need the
turtle just just so
resign i resign okay rather than give
you the satisfaction
i think i think we started off on the
wrong foot there let's try again this is
okay this is this is a-okay honestly i'm
gonna take a quick freeze
that was adjusting case freeze and i
think the just in case came true will be
the blatant bones actually milky bones
kind of sick
all right you can't win them all
you can't have a positive win rate in
them all
we draw these
not sweating this this is built to go
long
term roll me
okay low key
we get a little freaky here
even if we lose this round which i think
is possible but i i don't dislike our
chances that much
it's a level one horse
we're doing a lot of trading here
we might lose
we might draw okay that's a huge draw
because we did some great work for our
uh for our fish there
i don't know if the fish is gonna stick
around but
so we know we need to do this
honestly a quick buy sell on the owl is
kind of is kind of sick
give me a swan
give me a combine
give me a
honestly give me a cell just because i
don't respect you we should have sold
two then we there was a one gold mistake
but
i'm willing to take my chances here
beautiful
we don't sweat that
we do roll one of these up at the front
actually we roll it one back just in
case it spits out a ram it's a bit of a
weird squad it's not that impressive yet
but
our economy is is chunking just fine
this is not good okay it's a snail
at least we trade with the crab
nah we lose this this is an interesting
team there it's an interesting team
one hp down zero wins so far not where i
want to be quite frankly
um
we're gonna try to scale
really needed that to hit a swan quite
frankly
uh you know what
the time has come then he's losing his
mind he's full on losing his mind i'll
say it for you he's losing his
mind you can definitely take a dog
and start going
and start going and start combining
think about a meat here might be worth
more than a unit not not this unit
not this unit
this fish is getting sold asap probably
asap schrader
you can't you can't roll two of these oh
on the other hand though no you you
i'll tell you what
if we win or draw this i'll roll two
shrimps that's the egg promise
uh it's not gonna happen though so i
hope you were not attached to that idea
this team is much better than mine
you're just better man it's just a
better team
but now if this squad's not doing it
i think we gotta i think we gotta go
full buy sell
i think we gotta go i think i genuinely
think it's the only way
i genuinely think it's the only way so
give me one of these
nice buy and then sell
they buy and sell and buy and buy and
sell buy sell sell buy sell sell
the buying and selling show
he's losing his mind i'll say it for you
i know you were trying to say it i'll
say it for you he's losing his mind
this takes us to six gold that's the
dream
can you give me one of these real quick
four nine six eleven
toss me one of those real quick i don't
know if this is enough we're at zero
wins i feel like we did a lot of work
and yet i'm not that impressed with what
you know the end product is here
it's better than maya's theme like but
that's not really the question was not
is it better than maya's team i guess
that is the question because that's what
the game's about but uh okay so you
gotta go thanks for being here thanks
for playing nice little buff there ooh
thanks for the buff nice little buff
there i doubt we're gonna get a level
three
i hate to say it because i would love to
but
i really doubt it's happening i would
love to
um
get
a pill
honestly garlic is kind of cracked
so we no longer really need this turtle
well you know what we can we can save no
it's better this way oh but no no it's
not better this way
sell me go to five
this is weird sell me
we go to five gold
buy me
sell me
buy me
don't sell me
i just i like the caterpillar i think
we're just too it's too slow i don't
know if what we're doing is fast enough
it kind of seems idiotic but oh nice
weakness nice weakness on that one um
on the other hand i don't know we're
kind of popping no we're not this is a
guaranteed loss okay
all right let's just what are with nine
straight wins here it comes nine
straight wins you wanted to see it
it's a sell me
a buy me
i uh
although the meat is good i honestly
think this is a garlic
garlic
and then it looks like a selmy
buy me five is the magic number for us
because we gotta buy me sell me off of
that
roll me with a deer right at the front
here okay this squad i don't see how
this squad could lose
i know that's asking for comedic timing
i'm just saying
like we're definitely not losing this
one it's not happening
scooby doo 22 i don't think so not today
okay so at least we got two wins
absolutely under no circumstance because
then i would have to like sell my swan
on the other hand now i can do the same
value of what we already have
but with one less shrimp on the board
which is worth a lot to me so we'll do a
buy so that we get the trigger
then we'll do a combine then we'll do a
combine okay now
you got to think
it's i don't know is now the time for
the lobster i'd kind of be surprised i
don't really like any of these units
so roll me
i i do like you
i mean this is not
sensible
and yet here we go doing it
does this make any sense at all
i mean i feel like for all the
investment the two units i'm trying to
buff should be doing a lot better than
13 15 and 7 22.
for everything we've been through like
we have not gotten an adequate oh man if
only if only we've not gotten adequate
compensation okay so these are just i
don't know what i'm doing man i'm i'm
basically throwing for the meme
we can definitely go like you
you you
i guess
no that's okay
i don't think i want you we can go
temporary like an insect build
would be the inedible mouths isn't that
ironic it's like rain on your wedding
day
we we draw these i mean that's like
probably the most boring draw you could
ever ask for
but food pops us off
i think the way you do it well i don't
know if you give us an apple i don't
care a b is fine and apple's fine
whatever it's all good um so roll me
once
give me a beetle at the back
beetle tack is attached put a b on me
throw some bees on it now these guys all
become two fours for one round and
everything in the shop gets slightly
better even though we don't really care
i guess we could have done that a little
better but i mean one extra hp on three
units is kind of disgusting early like
if you're just out here trying to win
rounds early i think this is a real way
you could do that i'm not saying we got
the win sewn up or anything like that
in fact dude that was close
we had to give everything we got just to
draw there that's a little that's a
little sad
um you know we're combining
it's not what you want to see
can i tell you something though
i think you could buy
we can we can roll one time oh what do
you eat shop food give friends plus one
attack boo do we want you to eat food i
don't know
i i think
i think we do something like this
cupcake u
all of a sudden we got a six seven a
five seven we buy a five four to use
temporarily and we got a one six that
might be cracked for us in the future
one roll
why not honestly and i i honestly i'm
starting to believe in the power that
like maybe a cupcake
and some
some beetles can can carry us in the
early game
we that's very good economy for us
and that's also amazing like that that
basically could not have gone better you
know we're selling the owl at some point
so we're not sweating that
roll me once
shame on me
uh
i'm just thinking okay is that a crime
uh i think that the thinking that i'm
doing looks something like this
and then a cupcake
and then
honestly i'm like
look it so rarely does what i want it to
do but sure let's let's fit a 2-3 spider
in here let's see how this goes remember
our peacock and our owl are not long for
this world they are merely mercenaries
that's that's acceptable i see you're
rolling a crab build
interesting
we
we do okay here we do okay here
we win these no question about that
wasn't even close what do we have now
two wins that's i'm not used to doing so
well okay this is nice honestly i think
you definitely we sell you
oh i think we go heavy cell man
because like i'm just being straight up
with you
well we'll start here
sell you
are we even gonna have enough gold to do
what i want to do if i do this
maybe
sell you
sell you i might not be able to buy food
i would consider that to be a small
price to pay
we know we want this
i don't really care about buffing you
yet but okay fair enough
maybe would have been smarter
that's a big freeze um
i think here we try something like a
turtle
i'll i'll level with you man i'll level
with you i'll level with you
i don't really care about buffing
you know it's good
you guys being stronger doesn't really
matter but sure now we got a 2 4 snail
you never know i guess it's better than
a 2-2 slightly less laughable i do this
ox at the back scares me a great deal
but we have our own melon armor
isn't that right
so we crack it on this we get melon
armor we win these okay this is a very
unusual build we're in like i i think i
would say we're in like meta discovery
territory right now like we're just
trying to enjoy life we do need to get
some permanent scaling and i mean you
know that only really comes from the the
dog on this build but whatever like
let's keep it rolling man
i think we have enough hp to play with
to potentially roll two caterpillars
though it looks insane
you definitely benefit more from this
and then i'm like dude we got a 2-6 sure
let's make a 3-7 turtle that's kind of
nasty like
we don't have any permanent scaling
right now like that's horrendous i don't
know what we're going to do about that
maybe a poodle will show up at some
point and i'll be like a little bit more
pogged but
i mean this is not good this this is
mighty nasty uh it's a guaranteed loss
great time to get a snail i look anytime
you see a monkey like
especially early a monkey is is a recipe
for you lose late game you don't see
monkeys because people sell them to to
dump them but um
i i'm a believer in the potential of a
rhino right now but
i also really just like um
i think you're gonna go okay
and here's what i'm gonna try to do
i'm gonna feed you an apple
that way our rhino gets buffed slightly
we're not gonna give it meat it's
already getting melon armor
something to be said about this there's
something to be said about this um i
think a level two turtle with two
caterpillars is exactly what we're
searching for in our lives
and we can't really get rid of anything
else unless you want to roll a hatching
chick instead and i think it's possible
but i'm going to say no for the time
being although it would give us enough
gold to start the play but a little
early
no no we're not gonna kill you
we're not gonna worm
okay
we need to not lose this round
ideally draws or wins i mean that's
obvious you want to draw or you want to
win but uh in particular it matters even
more for us
okay the turtle this is nasty man this
is a nasty squad
they do do better against us than we do
against them
there's no doubt about i mean we lose
this obviously
okay how are we gonna get there because
even when our caterpillars pop they're
not gonna be that good
[Laughter]
uh okay i think that it's time for you
to go we accept the rhino right now
um and then we we need like a hatching
chick to get this going
we could combine you for a level three
but again it doesn't really buff us that
much yes yet i don't think you go eagle
pill i know it's a very popular
strat think maybe something like this
gets us
a little closer just a little closer
so we have a 13 16 melon armor rhino the
hope is we like break their team
uh and it's a white weenie build against
gilgamesh the king of babylon uh this
can this can work like this can
steamroll
it's not gonna kill the bus
but that's okay
it is gonna kill
all the rams
please
okay we are gonna kill the dog
and then we are gonna get you okay
that's big that's big we made it through
with a win
you're one turn away you're two turns
away we can start to think about this
then the turtle behind will do some
serious work
um you don't you can't apply the chili
pepper because we need to make sure that
we have the
um
the the melon armor
straight up i i do think you can freeze
one of these we're hey look we're
looking for a permanent buff if you're
gonna give me a permanent buff then give
me a permanent buff instead roll me once
don't need you so much anymore okay so
this would be another one that would be
nice to win 17 20. really we want to see
a chocolate bar level two rhino start
thinking about something insane like
toss in a little uh
toss in a little uh like a tiger behind
our rhino and then just go on wild
this seems fantastic
seems good to me man seems good to me
okay so we make it through we get our
first butterfly
imo you can play this even though the
melon armor would be nice on you
i like the idea of something like this
then we can temporarily give you some
garlic it should still work for a bit
here
no thank you
no thank you
possibly if we have to
no thank you
it's got a 20 23 garlic armor a 20 23 at
the back that's gonna have melon armor
this is not it is a white weenie build
but it only becomes a white weenie build
after the start so we're gonna lose our
rhino in the process here
at least this kills you that's like
merciful i don't know how this is gonna
play out it's a level three horse which
is is pretty spooky
i think we lose cause you're gonna
summon
yeah we lose okay but that's just i mean
there's a strong
a rare strong level three horse when
we've made a huge investment into
caterpillar
which has now popped for us okay
now i know you're looking at this and
you're going come on man get a bison out
there
i would i would we need a pill first
though
to really start thinking about it
we're getting pretty close to melon okay
oh that no the pills the pill doesn't
work that way the pill doesn't work that
way
are you willing to dump the hatching
chick here
i'm willing to try
how about the power to move you
now i'm not saying this is going to get
us there
all i'm saying is i'm i'm just uh
a man asking an animal to okay i was
gonna say asking an animal to love me i
would like to
go back on that that is not what i meant
this looks terrible this seems horrible
for me
drip uh to my dreams and my hopes well i
think we learned something today
and what we learned is dang free to play
got han got hands
or i mean pay to win i don't know what
i'm talking about but either way thanks
for watching hope you enjoyed the

hey everybody
it's been a long weekend uh have you
enjoyed playing super auto crabs this
weekend
i have
i at first i was a little i was
flattered i said that the crab meta that
i i did not invent but inherited must be
popular because i see them every game
then i got annoyed losing to crabs i
said do something else play a different
song um what are we on here by the way
we're on standard pack put me on put me
on pay to win let's just see how she
goes
um and then i instead of getting mad i
got even i started running double triple
scorpio in every game oh you got three
crabs cool well now i got three
scorpions i kill your tank with one or
two of them i kill your first crab your
second crab is like a 740 going up
against my real tanks thanks for the 10
wins i really appreciate it thanks for
the 10 wins anyway um the meta is in
it's in a weird state right now i
haven't played free to play or sorry pay
to win in a little bit um
i'm a straight up
i'm a straight up one three i don't mind
a one three roll me once i don't mind a
one three one three two three
and honestly freeze me and apple i feel
like we can get like some some duck
value here
be the gushing soup
why not
this sounds nice right it's a nice day
at the deli what's your favorite soup
i got it i mean
of course i love like a chicken noodle
mine hold the noodle please by the way
we lose these um
i love a mulligatawny i went through a
phase i ate a lot of
italian wedding soup let me tell you i
ate a lot of italian wedding soup
it was beginning to become a problem uh
i so i'm going to try something a little
different here okay normally i wouldn't
buy food
uh on round two because i think that it
gives you a i mean an apple in
particular is a plus one plus one on one
animal big whoop
however in this unique situation
i think if you buy and feed
i think if you buy and feed your beetle
now
you get a 3 4 instead of a 2 3 you get
two two fours instead of two one threes
and then we get a two four fish which is
beautiful and i think a two-two ant you
know
still is likely to die on its first hit
but those stats don't go anywhere so
that's like
what the heck is this
okay that bird will be scary eventually
right now they're giving up too much hp
but um that's a very funny build i i
can't be mad about that someone's having
fun with the game better arrest them uh
can i tell you as well i'm very
interested because the the test version
of the game right now is only available
on ichio i haven't checked it out yet
but i've heard tell
that instead of four hp you get 10 hp
i think that could actually have like a
drastic shift on the meta because right
now
my model and models are always wrong in
their own unique ways but my model is
you pretty much have a prerogative to
focus on winning every round that you
play uh instead of focusing on getting
to 10 wins by scaling because you have
so little hp losing 25 50 of your
hp to do setup to try to get to 10 wins
is a heavy cost but if you have 10 hp
i could totally see a situation where
maybe like you know
junkin or maybe it's only 10 hp and
versus i don't know but junking your
first couple of rounds to get some ducks
rolling or something like that could
actually be the way to play
um not guaranteed just that's just my
hunch
where are we going here four five not so
bad roll me once you gotta use your
brain here
roll me again
i'm not thrilled uh i'm not thrilled
i think we freeze this let's get weird
okay as we freeze this i'm gonna feed my
beetle again
that will make our swan slightly
stronger and then i'm more than happy to
throw a swan out there and i'm just kind
of like i'm playing the run
oh yes please uh as it comes to me
honestly
uh
i'm i'm playing it you know at run time
i feel like we got a pretty solid
assortment of stats going on here we're
definitely going to win this round uh
you can't always rely on your
uh foe running an antiquated horse
cricket build as if it's like you know
late september but
i suppose it happens time to time and
again i'm kind of uh yet again i'm kind
of a believer in like what if i just fed
you
now you get temporarily stronger what if
i fed you again
and then the the reason i like this
is honestly
i mean i i think you keep these two out
there for now i think you sell a fish
which is kind of you know garbage to
begin with
roll a bat and then toss me a little
seven eight
beetle there
i'm we we need a level up that's a given
but i do sort of feel like food men is
doing something for us now
okay so
unfortunately we're gonna i mean the bat
did not work out that nicely for us
we're gonna trade here you're gonna spit
out an ant don't hit the dodo please
okay that's very unfortunate
um we lose these but it's honestly like
it it came down to ant difference and
bad difference our squad i i think if
this was like probability based our
squad wins those
maybe not more often than it loses those
but more often than
you know it did there i disposed by
definition that makes sense
i i'm definitely giving you some garlic
although i should have waited because i
don't want you guys on the squad quite
frankly no offense meant
um
a little offense man i'm gonna i'm gonna
take my level up
squirrel nothing of value was lost
i'm gonna roll a four squad marty for a
minute here
freeze me
i'm really i'm disappointed by the way
that i went there i think we might be
running in the
like that last round might put us in
a position where i'm now like
i'm fighting for my freaking life out
here never mind actually we look like
we're doing pretty well
it's just nice to not be running into
crabs every game although it could
happen at any point
okay so let's consider this a proof of
concept of our food meta okay so i like
this no problem excuse me
um that's painful
i think it's okay to get a caterpillar i
think it's later than i would like but
life goes on
and i think maybe i mean to be honest
with you if we want to win rounds right
now
give me a garlic here
freeze me a swan i would not mind a
level two swan
i think you could try maybe dude i don't
know now i'm like what you kept this
what if you sold your bat and your swan
and instead you i was wondering what the
heck that noise was almost snoring in
here
i was every once in a while i just heard
a
i was freaking out man um
so this is a little controversial but
what if we went full food build
it's it's so nice by the way to oh let's
go
to have the swan
um because the swan does an incredible
job
we still lose these for the record but
just barely uh this one does an
incredible job of giving us a little
extra money but i'm willing to go like
mimetic here you want to meme it up we
can also run you as like a flex position
it's like thanks for being part of the
show i've enjoyed having you around
uh we'll buy a rabbit
start feeding you
i'm a huge fan of what that look like
right there
why don't you level me
a little micro meta not yet i think is
the answer i think the answer to that is
not yet
roll me once
i would definitely freeze a salad once
more and i i we could lose this round i
have a hard time seeing us really
running into trouble until we start
seeing scorpions that are easily gonna
you know munch us down
garlic does super well against uh you
know like white weeny summon builds and
stuff like that like this is i mean this
person is running an old school meta i'm
not saying it can't work i'm just saying
you know
one green uh beetle seemed to do an
awful lot of work for us there so at
least with this meme build we're
breaking even at a minimum
uh i think you can go like
i think you could try it why not let's
let's eat some salads
let's eat some salads
roll me
i don't really love any of those units
so i'm just going to be like
straight up with you man i think we're
going to move you back we're going to
move you up we're going to have you eat
a cupcake
17 19 which is actually going to be a 22
24 garlic 11 12 garlic behind this is
not optimistically a 10 win run but i i
am looking at this like
let's just see how far the rabbit hole
goes okay
hatching chick dying to deers here is
not relevant um
at least
we're coming out that's looking good man
that's looking good
so that's five minimum we're doing
better than breaking even
um
caterpillar's one away
i don't really see a chili pepper pop in
here
you could
at least freeze a bison to think about
it in the future
i'm a little annoyed i just want to see
some foods man
oh i mean that's food
um
it's interesting isn't it
i think you got to get rid of the rabbit
it sucks that it would be right now when
we're getting a nice buff but
i here's the play okay if you sell your
rabbit you go to eight
you buy a can you go to five you buy a
cow
you go to two you feed you twice
sell the cow and buy a buffed bison
and i think you'd feel okay about that
and then we'll lose the chocolate but
life goes on so we go eight
uh can
five
lovely
two
we feed you because you're gonna buff
the
bison
we've got an 812 bison coming out there
right now and we reworked this we put
our 15 16 in front again i'm not saying
we got any promises here i'm just saying
you know every win at this point is a
golden gift
i don't see scorpio i see crab i don't
see scorpion
i have to tell you this seems very bad
for me
no
no no no
hold on yeah we're dead okay so i mean
that's where you want some some
scorpions involved i'm not disappointed
there's honestly five wins with that
unusual build where we were off balance
felt kind of okay
i don't think we buy food yet i'm very
content to roll a similar build and then
freeze me an apple for our next time i
know that apple sucks but what if it
didn't
what about a shy fireman hey
there was an alarm here or something
would it be okay with you guys if i like
came in or whatever like it's cool if
you'd
say no like
i'm here to fight the fire i guess
that could be fun shy fireman
it's really no value in having two of
you except for the stats huh that's
unfortunate but
um
i think i think we just buy man like i
think we do this
i'm content here i i love a fish for the
stats
but i think i'm content to roll two two
three mosquitoes and and i feel that's a
little greasy and i i mean greasy in the
best way possible we didn't really
reconfigure our team here but that's
okay any anytime i see a lot of units
that have uh
more than three hp i'm pretty pleased
i'm realizing now wait how'd you get a
crap i guess you just got a little luck
it's fine it happens nice otters
nice otters
um
combine me combine me
that's not really what you want to see
to put it politely um
however i mean
for a second here sure you know what now
we got a a 2-4 snail
that buffs every other
unit roll once i these are not the
the
units i'm looking for but these are
great stats eight eight four five
four four four four two four
i'm not too disappointed is it it's
again
look this horse build is gonna look
better than it actually is right now
just because like we haven't gotten
garlic yet but it's still
pretty terrible i'm i'm telling you like
i'm not saying horses cannot get to 10
wins
i'm just saying they are very low in the
meta rate now i would not commit to a
horse build early maybe they had no
other choice but
i'm just saying okay
for now like
i guess we didn't need to do it that way
but
hold on hold on roll me
i absolutely love a swan if we're gonna
do a swan we should do it like this that
way you at least get two three six
we'll pop you in here
there's a swan or two getting leveled is
also fantastic for like feeding into
some food meta i don't know if we're
going food meta long term but it's where
we it's where we seem to be gravitating
right now with our with our insect
design we win these what are we dude i
don't know i'm feeling kind of
comfortable on the insect build right
now two wins one loss
could be a product of the squads we're
running into i like a puppy i'm just i'm
i don't know i'm not sold on it like
just yet
i think we'd like uh we like that
i think we'll freeze this because we
want both really we'll roll one okay
that's gonna take us to level three
i think you have to
you're actually just a that's a cruel
twist of fate um
i think we'll we're still gonna freeze a
bat
but
rather than buy one right away i'm a big
fan of this garlic raid here which is
also going to make you stronger
this ladybug is not long for this world
so i'm not going to freeze the other one
i think this is a much better and faster
team than our last one though so we we
really want to see like a bison right
off the bat
okay we got early crab meta it's it's
too early for that crab to be popping
they'll be scary later but for now we're
good
okay
are we are we ushering in the era of
insects eating apples i don't know
i don't know i don't know but we could
be we could be okay
so i think straight up
we dump you we dump you we might even
say no to a bat because i think we got
we got some long-term scaling power here
you take one of those get scalin thank
you so much i mean a 1 8 bat is just
hilarious but
okay i mean basically we're spending
three gold to get two hp i don't mind it
until we get scorpions like a 16 20
beetle is going to do some serious work
oh well i mean something could take us i
don't know what it would be the rest of
our squad is is legitimately like
nothing
but i'm telling you if we get a bison or
um
i don't even know what like a hatching
chick would extend our our dominance in
the mid game a little longer
i'll be straight up with you man
we're dumping a level one mosquito who
cares nobody a rooster could be an
interesting play
um but you know
i'm nothing if not a um
if not an innovator
one three two
okay
like
here's the thing
i'm gonna freeze you
and for now i'm gonna buy a pair
just because i i think that we
buff you on top of this
um and we'll roll once and we'll freeze
this apple because it'll buff you once
again
we're i mean we're really buffing we're
buying the poodle just to buff the
uh
the beetle a little further so like i'm
not that
sold on it
overall
as a scaler but if we're already winning
we can afford the regress slightly to
advance our scaling exponentially which
i i hope is what's gonna happen here
um
so i'm gonna start with one combine i
know it looks like you should do two
that's all right everybody makes
mistakes
freeze me once roll me once i want
nothing but salad who is still pretty
sick the way they give each other hp
um
and honestly one of the great strengths
of this run right now is that everything
is disposable except for our frontline
units so like we if we
one of the things that i think makes a
scorpion for example so good is that
literally
for three gold you have the chance to
trade with something that the enemy has
invested like you know 30 gold into
so ev getting something like that would
be totally fine
i i think at this point let's combine
that i should have bought well i don't
know maybe yes maybe no uh
we can make you stronger
let's start here just hit the front
you're a piece honestly
roll me
just hit the front like it's not hard
no i'm gonna change my life i'm gonna
keep you around you're you're sick okay
you're you're sick
however
give me a chicken because we can because
we can
sell me a
sell sell the swan
buy me
sell me
buy me
freeze me
don't sell me
the buffs are fine here this will make
our bison stronger it's going to take a
minute don't get me wrong but oh geez
louise man
we're gonna try to get if we can get a
chicken
buffing every unit that we get inside of
our shop oh my god i don't even know
what to say now this is scary this is a
double monkey rooster turkey team yeah
this is where at least we take our first
l
i don't i don't disrespect it we're
trying to we're trying to shove two
metas in here okay and i i think that it
stands a reasonable chance to work but
it is also kind of funny don't get me
wrong we're taking the we'll take the
plus twos on this one
and then we'll buy a celia
and then we'll sell you and then we'll
buy you
and then we'll sell you
we're not gonna buy sell you here i
think this would be a great time to fit
two bisons into the equation that's fine
um
yeah it's totally fine we don't need the
second one yet um
roll me
freeze me
freeze me freeze me free i mean at this
point you're like a can is better but
[Laughter]
okay freeze the can you know what
keep that frozen
a snail i snooze i snooze on a snail for
some reason
is this sensible no i think i've lost my
mind um
you got to make sure you're getting
buffed because you're getting
cannibalized by the poodle right now
which is not what we want
this looks okay
this looks totally fine
no it doesn't we're actually
i don't think we're going to lose but
the the kangaroo is going to cheese me
off that's for sure
okay great name in my jeep great name
um
a dragon would fit here but i don't know
if dragon is in
pay to win so this would be a we got to
get rid of something it's going to be
the rabbit but thanks for sticking
around as long as you did
can me
buy me
sell me
buy me
sell me
roll me
i was really looking for like a pig
i'm just insane i guess is like that's
my problem
no don't combine come on don't don't be
a fool
freeze me freeze me freeze me this could
not be smart
this cannot be a smart idea
on the other hand
it's nice to roll a different kind of
meta don't you oh this is nasty you're
nasty man don't you think it's nice to
roll a different kind of meta here
i'm not you know trying to make anybody
feel bad you know if you roll
crab
by then i'm not just knocking this guy
if if you roll crab kangaroo snake you
know six monkeys whatever like i get it
not everybody streams this 10 hours a
day and winning is just fun um
however
why are you a coward i guess would be
the first question i would ask
and the second question i would ask is f
you um okay you get out of my face this
is a weird unfreeze here dragon as well
okay
freeze me
chili pepper me
we'll probably lose here but if we win
this is about to be a chicken dragon
synergy which makes sense because the
dragons did evolve into birds if i
remember correctly is that not how that
went down
okay this seems
pretty not good
i would describe this as a pretty not
good situation for me
it's pretty cool where'd you get the
idea to roll um a fly oh from everybody
oh i see i guess not everybody
you know sees themselves as a risk taker
uh that's still what that was a seven
win i think we could have gone further
if we just leaned into our scaling but i
was having fun so sue me so we'll we'll
run one more here
um
if this is the squad then this the squad
give me give me a tutu in the middle
i'll be the suave streamers i don't
think that's necessarily true clean yes
i
especially
on a on a personal hygiene level i
consider cleanliness
in the same ballpark as godliness i
would even say
it's been said many people are saying
this give me one of these give me one of
these
i think our best chance actually comes
from a freeze here
and then like
a b
on might as well be on you
because you're actually likely to sort
of stick around so we we got you know
plus two plus two and then a plus one
plus one getting summoned as well the
plus two plus two is only for one round
but okay this is a great situation for
double mosquito
we actually trade with that fish
yo we win these we win these
i don't know how that would have looked
if we didn't buy the bee and i i'm not a
honey
kind of guy myself personally lately um
i think we definitely just take our our
simple combine
um
i'm like i'm not that impressed
with what we got here i think you could
uh you know like okay
if we're gonna do it like this let's buy
you
and i honestly do think like
freeze you
okay we'll take we'll freeze you
you can you can shove a swan into like
any build for a little bit at least
um i'm not that optimistic but i'm
hoping that maybe ladybug can can do
something for us i never seen before
okay that crab is not ready for prime
time yet it's great news for us
we actually trade with the crab which is
beautiful
i feel like this is uh definitely a we
win these i think if you what i'm
realizing is if you go like ladybug or
beetle or both
there's a case to be made for like
investing right away
in in winning like right now
i'm kind of like you peace i'm kind of
like you peace
beautiful because like this is this is a
nasty squad for the moment at least
i'll be straight up though i think we
roll i i regret everything um
just like
so
congrats we're going to go like a little
meme we're going to roll a 9 10 which is
actually going to be a 12 13. we're
gonna roll a three squad marty on turn
four just because i refuse to i i
understand the rat i don't really
understand the hedgehog but i'm gonna
pretend to i'm gonna say i understand
the hedgehog
what's wrong with the your squad hey is
your squad feeling okay there we didn't
lose that by much honestly a rat
probably would have gotten us there but
it's about the principle
it's about the principle of the dang
thing
round five we're starting to see some
tier threes you can give me one of those
you could roll me
you could give me one of these
you could sell me two of these
oh i actually hate you
you know what you could
you could buy a um
you could buy a beaver salad but i think
i'd rather just buy it oh but then you
can't get a salad and then a turtle so
give me a beaver
can't the thing is it can't connect to
the server
so we're gonna sell it please hit you
really appreciate it thank you buy one
of these real quick
this could be where it starts to fall
apart for the record but i'm just gonna
choose to ignore that that's a
possibility um
this actually bodes kind of well for us
like that ant losing its meat for no
reason is wonderful
um
we we've taken out your good units here
we got this is no sweat man i guess the
owl can stick around until it's no
longer prudent for it to be here
that's why you got to be careful about
like i think people look at that
situation and they go what the heck were
they doing why would they put the meat
on the and if it's just going to get
eaten well they probably put the meat on
the ant because it was like their best
unit early and then they got a whale
that synergized with the ant that's why
you got to be very careful when you put
the buff on early
you could end up with a with a heavy
opportunity cost later
i'm gonna go insane for scaling here
i definitely want you to stick around
i definitely love a bat but
i'm willing to get a little freaky with
it
level two swan would hit the spot man
level two swan
we had two extra gold per turn
this doesn't look too bad
at this point by the way i don't know i
think my honest appraisal is that some
people look at like um
this actually might get a touch nasty
here some people look at um
it's not gonna get nasty by the way they
look at units the wrong way like is
there really a benefit to getting a
mosquito to level three not with its
flavor text but yeah if it scales nice
with a bison
uh which is something if it showed up
right now we would be freaking stoked
quite frankly
similarly like i know i like criminally
underrate the rooster
i'm willing to accept that
i'm willing to live with that
probably
a can seems prudent because most of
these units are not long for this world
probably but as long as it's working for
the time being
i'm a pretty happy man we could
definitely start to think about rolling
um
oh man hold on we're actually not doing
too bad we can start to think about
rolling our um
our ladybug behind the turtle what is it
four wins i feel like we're doing pretty
well that's five wins okay
dude this is it's all about the insects
baby give me one of these
i love it i absolutely love it
that's unfortunate
i think we definitely respect this let's
buy a can
does buff you temporarily we're really
fishing here uh and not really for a
salad i think
okay i definitely think it's a little
late for a bunny unfortunately i don't i
don't really know what we're fishing for
i guess well one of these to get us to
level three
and then um
i mean i don't know i mean we're
basically just betting on big units
which is fine i love that we're killing
your whale
that
i love that we're killing two of your
units
um
i'm a little scared about this shark i
think they got a great squad uh set up
here
you're doing 12 okay actually i'm not
sweating it at all i think they had a
really good squad really smart uh
composition but big number beats small
number
lucky us there's our bison if we want it
and i think we do
let's buy a can we're making some space
really
don't really care for a mammoth
the swan's been very nice but
right now it's time for you to go you
are the weakest link goodbye we love
winning so toss me a little cupcake up
at the front here
you need to scale faster we're we're
going like full anti-bat right now
look this is the freaking dream man
oh
lordy lordy his name is northern lion's
butt yeah well
take a big sniff
didn't even come close
i'll be i'll be straight up with you man
i'll be straight up with you as long as
we keep you around you can go you might
laugh at this all you want you can
totally roll double scorpion and then
protect the strong unit
give you a nice little buff man give you
a nice juicy little buff
the other thing is you don't need two
scorpions if one of them lives through
two attacks
so you could get a little freaky here i
don't mind this man i don't mind this uh
and then doing something like this
and then doing something like this
and then honestly i'm gonna get insanely
freaky with you
we're gonna try to make a scorpion live
through
more than one attack
[Laughter]
an 11-11 scorpion could ruin some days
here if we hit the right squad
um we hit exactly the rights it's
northern light is but again
oh
whoopsie
all right keep watching thanks for your
support i really appreciate it all right
there's eight wins
love to see it man
i'm a i'm a psycho i don't mind like
leveling up a scorpion before we do it
let's can
i know there's a t-rex hey the t-rex is
cool and all that but like you know
what's even cooler than a t-rex
needless level 2 scorpion
1515 big scorp
oh my god
you peace
[Laughter]
okay have we perhaps uh have we come to
the end of the efficacy of this maybe am
i going to pivot absolutely not because
this is this is my life now um
you're not scaling fast enough and
that's fine
i'm not sad about it or whatever but
it's
um i think we'll we'll give you some
melon armor we'll roll
there's no real place for you right now
i mean i'm gonna i'm gonna lose my mind
i'm gonna give you one of these can i
tell you something that'll make you lose
your mind i'm gonna buy chocolate just
to buff the scorpion for one
because i'm fully committed i'm pot
committed we already got eight wins it's
a lot of fun let's freak people out
okay the freakiness did not really work
you might think that it did but truth be
told like a 1-1 scorpion would still
have done the job there so i'm not
claiming victory for that but i will
claim victory
for the fact that we're easily going to
roll over the rest of this squad
i think we got lucky we ran up against
the team that was a little
still on their way
i'm going to invest in some can action
for a second here
um
i know i'm i'm a you know what
we could do worse than that
stop trying to get me to take the best
unit in the game he sucks
we don't really i understand that we
don't really need the level two turtle
uh on the flip side i don't know i think
i've just lost my mind
yes okay well you know what now i'm like
maybe it was actually
insanely good that we did have a level
two turtle although your butterfly still
just did some incredible work
you can't really be mad about that i
mean
that's a pretty classic build
um
okay roll me
roll me
we're a little late for a can
i'm upset
still upset okay honestly i was
basically like looking for a cupcake so
sure there you go you know what now we
got a 2121 scorpion
all right this is a throw but it i'm
still
i mean we're it's it's one shot right we
punched through melon armor with this
already we might we're not gonna live
but
we do okay this is
the same squad we are accept except no
microbe this time
i'm not mad like
because it is what it is like but would
i rather get nine wins
trying to
summon a big scorp or would i rather get
10 wins roll in you know puppy t-rex
butterfly i mean
both of them sound kind of sick don't
get me wrong but i'm happy that we we
didn't have any losing runs we had a
great time we played with fun builds we
introduced some new stuff into my psyche
and i'm starting to think now i'm
realizing
early mid game
ladybug beetle if you pivot you could
try to roll that long term and it may
work we're only one win away
but if you pivot you know
round nine round ten t-rex start scaling
that way
that might be a recipe but for now
thanks for watching hope you've enjoyed
being in the laboratory thanks for
watching i'll see you next time click

i'll see you next time see ya



hey everybody welcome back and super
auto pets we're going to keep rolling uh
pay to win
because i think we're learning something
i feel like we're learning a little bit
i don't mind playing against all packs
uh this is exactly the shop i wanna
we're gonna go for like i mean it's too
early to force ourselves we're gonna
just stay on
let's call it a flexible
mid-game dominance build we love to see
this i think we love to see this
i'll be the delicious
i mean there's some great ones
there's some great ones let's just be
the delicious dust bunnies i'm trying to
keep it a little quieter the baby's
napping it's a sunday don't want to wake
up the baby could be disastrous
we lose round one we didn't lose to a
horse
small brain you lose to a horse big
brain we just lost to an otter
i respect that it happens from time to
time
we can definitely do this
we can definitely roll
we can definitely look at a fish
buy a fish
after
feeding
a single beetle
and now it's a bit of a nasty squad
three four two four two three two four
two four
and i'm spent okay i mean i'm not saying
this is guaranteed here what i would
love to see is a shop that has a green
ladybug or a red beetle i'm always
scared of a three shop or a three squad
marty now and i'm we lose these for sure
i'm telling you big units can can like
be in deep is better than b and y at
early games so this is a very scary time
for us
i think we roll
we pretty much needed to get this
if that didn't happen we were in in for
a
uh viewer beware you're in for a scare
shall we say so we we want to win now
um if we want to win now then i think
what we do is we we buy some
food and we do i mean a four seven dirty
rat am i really gonna be trying to put a
four seven dirty rat out there i i guess
i'm gonna give it a try i don't really
feel compelled to level up a fish
that doesn't enter i guess it would be a
3-6
like the 3-6 mafia
i can't believe it by the way but we are
about to
pick up a dub here with the rat on our
team it must be nice it must be nice to
have radicus on your side i don't know
what the heck happens if you take him to
the next level
i really
don't want to find out
freeze me one of
these that's the same shop you joke sir
this is terrible news um we're not
really seeing anything that that really
tickles the fancy right now um
i think we're going to buy this
and we're going to buy this and we're
going to freeze this and you know the
you know as well as i do i i mean the
getting the bad is the smart play but
i'm kind of maybe tunnel vision is the
right way to describe it you just made
your crab worse what's up with that
you
so freaking lucky
[Laughter]
we lose these by the way
we lose these not because of the rat the
rat actually put us in a position where
we could have won
it honestly was just kind of like some
bad stats i'm i'm willing to accept it
um this would be a miracle to get out of
and it's wait what are we round round
five with three losses is like that's
unprecedented man
okay we could maybe start to think about
getting a bison
i'm not i'm not calling this as uh like
a likely outcome by the way we run right
at the front so that the dirty rat you
know maybe uh when it dies it interrupts
their ability to summon a unit
14-6 beaver huh
does it interrupt you
at least we trade
and then we trade and i i think we win
this but the rat is scaring the crap out
of me as is the rest of our squad quite
frankly just to break even would would
feel like a bit of a golden gift here i
think
so let's um
let's sell the rat
i mean straight up with you i mean a buy
sell
you don't need the summon space it's not
a dog but with the pig we're going to do
the buy sell there for sure we get the
trigger on that
roll me
i i think it's a little late to fit a
dog in though i understand the
the potential methodology we can roll
one time
i like this roll
um
i do i just now i wish we had more gold
but it's the way that cookie crumbles i
suppose so i'm going to do um
i'm going to do buy
cell and then i'm going to freeze this
guy right here i'm gonna put a four five
rat
at the front and uh
i'm not thrilled with this but we're
we're in uncharted territory like nathan
drake i feel like we we've got you know
we're trying to bust the meta wide open
a little bit just like our melon armor
got busted open unfortunately
um dude we're so lucky the bison got
that extra trigger
which actually oh we lose to the rat
living okay that was terrible but i
honestly put some of that i'll shoulder
the blame
wink wink
but i feel like we put a lot of that
blame on some slightly sub-optimal shops
as well
uh let's beat the um
be the submissive sailors they're all
they're they're already a little
submissive aye aye captain oh no captain
don't have me swap the poop deck haha
unless
it drives me crazy does nobody else see
how crazy this is
come on horse duck
horse duck thanks for the win
i don't mind
freezing
rolling
i shouldn't have frozen the hot i didn't
freeze the honey we're okay because then
look at this look at this for a bye now
all of a sudden you got a 2-4 and you
got a 2-3 and you got a three creatures
much more likely to survive a little bit
longer uh we got one combined next time
a fish combine is solid for sure will
become a three
six i think
great hit honestly that that hit could
change the course of the whole game
didn't even get to our our backline
creatures feeling much stronger than i
did last time much stronger indeed you
definitely can roll a dog here if you're
gonna roll a dog
i think you should
combine your fish
buy some meat
you get the value of the meat you also
get the plus one there
um and then i'm a simple man i'm a
simple man i think you sell mosquito
the way to do this without wasting gold
unfortunately makes our next shop worse
but i'll live with that we get the gold
on reserve on return next time we come
back
uh wait to the shop because when we sell
we'll get two i don't know i don't know
but i i feel like this is okay
um
our ant did not die which is kind of
necessary uh we trade with the duck
our beetle does some good way this looks
like a win man
the horse i'm telling you it's it's for
your own benefit
that the horse is
falling down the the power rankings you
don't want to roll this guy long term
i'm just i'm telling you as your friend
and and the confidant
i think we want you around
you can do a buy sell for your dog
we really want a pill or some real food
i'm rolling again i don't care
this will cheese you off man roll me one
more time okay this i like this i like
this we can start to think about getting
rid of our ants why don't you give me
it sucks
it benefits the dog you lose some effect
on this one but you know what
hit me here
combine me you're not long for this
world so
it does annoy me freeze me because
you're not along for this world
buy me
we got a five seven you're you're kind
of looking a little little freaky up
there now give me one of those um i
don't well we'll freeze it for now
that's a that's a big freeze
i'm not good at clicking things
this squad is good for turn four this
squad is pretty good the dog needs uh to
level but it's not insanely
urgent i think their kangaroo might
might feed us our first loss here
um you know what
so freaking lucky man so freaking lucky
you had exactly the right amount of hp
so freaking lucky again you're gonna be
like you lost to a horse didn't lose to
a horse did not lose to a horse lost to
a great kangaroo and i have nothing but
respect for that
despite the things that i may have said
in the moment that would maybe make you
feel differently let me get a bye thank
you so much let me get a cell
that's beautiful you love to see it we
really want to see some garlic as well
um this is the easiest buy in my life we
could put that right there we could
honestly freeze two of you for now
it's a good buy man that's a good buy
you don't honestly as a 4-6 i'm just
being straight up with you you don't
need to be on the planet anymore
get sold get unfrozen
get bought
get rolled
that's exactly what i wanted to see 2-2
snail get out of my face buy me some
garlic armor stay frozen
so it's a four squad marty but it's a
strong four squad we get two extra gold
no guarantees a guy hates seeing a
kangaroo man don't give him a turtle or
a sheep whale whale i can live with
we do great here do we do great here
mad ladison what a name
okay i'm i'm attached to this squad
bunny is really good man you you can i i
think you can get some great stuff going
there you know we want our summon i
don't even know why you're sticking
around quite frankly freeze me a bunny
for a sec
we could buff the bunny
i really don't care to i think you you
start here
sell me we go to seven
buy me we go to four freeze me
we can absolutely combine swans roll two
bunnies next time
which means we're gonna freeze one of
these even though the apple sucks
there's times when it doesn't
and you know what you can freeze me an
owl in there as well i'm feeling i'm
feeling pretty solid turn six we got a
12 16 garlic dog up at the front it
loses to garlic armor
uh or melon armor
which is what's gonna happen right here
but
then you got a four eight we win these
we win these they're rolling a very
similar build they're rolling a duck
i think they had a little dodo action
involved in that it happens round seven
now we're freaking talking man
so you gotta level first
it's it's fine right like it's fine
it's fine i'm not excited about it but
it's it's fine we might think about it
in the future but i'm not thinking about
it too much in the here and now
give me one of these freeze me once just
as just as a maybe just as a little
maybe round seven caterpillar
i think you could do worse
get that dog buffed up a little bit
now the swan and the rabbits
the rabbit's less so but the swan really
needs to scale if anything's gonna
happen here
like we needed to level up otherwise
it's it it as a 66 is not doing much for
us generating one gold per turn
i would love to see that change we're
going to keep you frozen for a minute um
because we're really looking for
something like
that's just unfortunate um
i'll be straight up with you man
it's been fun while it lasted
i don't think you can roll that
caterpillar
i think we buy a pig i think we sell a
pig and then we go to six then we have
three rabbits we buy a salad
am i i was just gonna say am i insane
[Laughter]
should you not be experiencing the
powers of the buffing now we gotta i
mean at this point i'm like you could
just buy foods that distribute random
foods oh this is
this is not that bad like the scorpion
bodies me but like not enough
and then we beat your bee and we crush
you and there's the power of honey
badger it only loses to meme builds
three rabbits
some point we're probably gonna want
another unit okay but i'm like i've lost
my mind
i'm eating pears and salads
i'm eating pears and salads
at some point the great thing about this
obviously is that if we get some losses
we can combine the rabbits and then we
got two places to put scorpions okay we
got a crab build jonah owns you well
that remains to be seen jonah that
remains to be seen
experience the true power of the bunny
build
the problem with this build is that it
has to win if it starts drawing
we got to pivot
before things become truly nightmarish
so this is basically a three six
some of it sticks around i'm happy to
keep this is a freeze for future
purposes without a doubt
i'll be real with you i i don't even i
think you accept your hp here and then
you say you know
what assimilate into the board cube and
look at this now we it's round ten we
got a scorpion up at the front we're
probably not going to run into melon
armors their rowan anti-crab build
honestly does quite a number on me as
well but we still win these
i feel for you okay cause the only
reason you would run a skunk probably is
to stop crab builds i'm not running crab
builds as a result i apologize to you
because that's unfortunate i'm also not
wearing hockey pants as christian bale
said in
the dark knight i'm not wearing hockey
pants
i don't think we need another dog
on the other hand
while we're here we don't lose much from
this
straight up this is fun
this is a good time
yeah okay i mean i guess i
you know what just give me the ones that
that distribute the food the nicest like
that
i wouldn't mind we could we could turn
this into a potential buff scorpion
build if things start going wrong
um okay this is this is not ideal
i'm very concerned about this level two
rooster
but we do great with the garlic here
like the numbers just work out very
nicely
ah we lose this
it's not bad difference i think their
bat hit the worst units for them it
could have hit and they still made it
that's just a good squad man you got to
respect the good squad when you see a
good squad
feed me
feed me
i love the these guys are tanking up man
these guys are tanking up
i think it's a freeze freeze we got room
to work with right like this is you got
hp so you're gonna sell me you're gonna
buy me give me a nice buff
you're gonna roll me once
i'm content i don't really care to keep
the
snail around but this nail is not really
what determines whether we're going to
win or lose here
um seems like a pretty nice get up at
the front
i don't see how we lose this quite
frankly
beautiful okay so would you look at that
that's that's a 10 win
uh triple bunny food build
that feels nice that was a pretty like
normal start that we then took to the
freaking moon so i like it um
of these i'm willing to roll my my dice
here and get exactly the same shot
this is terrible
hard to see a situation where we lose
early on i'll be the wavy fingers hey
guys
uh sorry did i say lose i meant hard to
see a situation where we win
maybe maybe a horse and we we snipe an
ant this is like it's guaranteed lost
territory just embrace it we draw these
holy crap
okay that's just absurdly lucky i think
i don't even want to crunch the numbers
i think we just
we beat the odds
they really they don't respect is the
thing they don't respect
the insects they said you got an insect
win okay
like enjoy your life i guess
give me freeze this give me a 3-3 beetle
like they're never gonna give us the
ladybugs again i i've mastered them and
they got offended i understand
it's a very similar looking squad here
we sniped their ant which is uh i mean
it would be good for us but then i i
think that it didn't
actually
i think the ant difference kind of came
through in the clutch form but we we
draw these yet again
you really want to pick up at least one
win in your first two but
i mean an 0-0
it's kind of good when you consider
how bad things looked for us for a bit
there i think you can totally swing it
man like
i and i i think what might be the play
here
is uh
like i think this squad is trash right
now i'll just i'll just call it like i
see it
let's try a little cheeky peacock at the
back
i think this squad is trash right now
but if we can get the peacock to scale
with with some
uh
wow we're so lucky man if we can get the
peacock to scale with some uh
some food then then anything can happen
we're actually going to win this which
is is really sad for because i
think their team is better than ours but
mosquito laughs at that sometimes it
says hahaha
you need garlic more than you need food
unfortunately
we don't really need you yet roll me
sell me
i like it
roll me
okay now now now now now now i'm taking
a chance don't get me wrong
i'm not
i'm not a huge believer in the long-term
benefit of a 310 peacock but
it's probably gonna it's probably gonna
trade two
it it might do even better
like oh that fish is mighty spooky if we
killed your fish i would be so thrilled
i think that's actually what's gonna
happen
and then we win these okay you know what
you can't always play the same thing
this is uh this is a testament to that
you can fit a hatching chick in here no
question let's minimize the chance that
we are going to hit a mosquito with a
salad
you really needed a slice there man i
really needed a slice
okay for the time being
i'm gonna give you a chance i thought
about honey on the uh
on the peacock just to get the one hp
but
okay i think this i i know this seems
like sandbagging
it is sandbagging we're actually gonna
we're gonna do pretty well
here i thought for sure we were going to
lose when i saw their team and that is
not correct i apologize for the
attempted sandbag this is what we've
been looking for forever one of these
please
you really want like a second rabbit to
get things popping
we're on round six
i'm i'm not a complicated man like
that's that's a nice thing for me there
you could probably no because we need to
get rid of two things and i don't see
that happening please you gotta play the
front we need garlic on our fish if the
fish is gonna stick i'll tell you
straight up i love that i i see the
hatching chick like an early game
scorpion you buy it for three when
you're done with it you dump it and you
say thank you very much
it's a bit spooky um it this is more
than a bit spooky it's a loss it's a
good team
well
you know tank crab kangaroo dodo that's
that's a it's a bit of a meta build i'm
not saying you know
you should be upset or offended or
anything like not everybody's down with
412 peacock with no buffs on it
except garlic armor you know it takes a
special a special type
i'll be real with you the mosquito
is not long for this world nor is the
fish quite frankly
but for now
i see there's one there it's just we we
gotta invest all our efforts into you
give me another bunny like you're
actually being a bit of a piece right
now
we're gonna roll like this for a second
we can't fit the bison which is a shame
because it actually would have worked
well if we'd known that there were some
mosquitoes coming down the pipe but you
know how can you know
this is very much coming to a dangerous
head right now our peacock has picked up
no scaling
it should be good for us for a like a
bit but
uh then that's gonna change
that badger is like horrible for you
[Laughter]
and you know it actually doesn't
materially change the impact of the game
i think it's just sort of funny we win
these for certain
okay but it's really hard to see how we
get past like seven wins here unless we
we start to mix it up a bit
for now i'm willing to try to invest in
a swan i'm willing to
hit you with one of those finally
finally
freeze me roll me
i'm a big believer in the fact that this
snail might uh
be
warranted here just another bunny at
some point or you know more peacocks you
know there's a lot of potential
opportunities that would really help me
out here that seem to not be coming to
pass but
it's okay hey look at this look at this
just sometimes
garlic does way more than you'd expect
in the mid game
okay well i'm just being real with you
okay we've kind of like we're pot
committed to some extent
because our best chance of getting to 10
is probably just winning early which
means we got to get this off the ground
like
post haste
you're not you're never going to level
three you're getting dumped at some
point
when you buy food get a refund you know
what i'm going to freeze you i have no
delusion that that is likely to work out
for us but
here we are oh dude that that dodo
followed by that crab
extremely nasty for business i like the
hedgehog at the back
that's a recent buy i don't know i don't
know what the point of it is but i like
it
okay so
really like
this will be controversial you're more
important than you
so get out of my face you big disgrace
and we want to fit a scorpion hold on
sheesh
nice salad nice double
okay
take one of those i suppose roll me
this is bad this is really horrible um
it's really
it's really hard for me to see
how we get more than five wins
this is not this is the kind of squad
you run up against and you're like what
the heck just happened
hey on the bright side oh there's no way
there's no way you're killing at 36 34.
don't even like enter the uh
don't let the confidence enter your
system there's just no way
don't forget we got a 10 win last time
okay or
two times recently
i guess you're going i guess it's your
time and when it's your time it's your
time so we're still keeping a 10-8
chilly rabbit with no with no doubles on
it which i i'm just stunned at the in
frequency of the doubles we've gotten
this time for whatever reason but here
we are i would rather carry a scorpion
with me than a bat um you are necessary
at some point but i would say not yet
honestly i'm willing to take a chance
that we'll never get there maybe just to
keep this going um how many triggers you
got one trigger left okay then buy me
some pizza
i know that the t-rex is like
this attempting play
instead by an owl hey hey it worked it
worked okay and then i think we roll and
try to save oh
my god
you can't and there's no way we lose
this round and live that's just
unfortunate uh oh a peacock oh my god
they still make those okay
um
i think we're going down but we went
down in a in a blaze of glory
i hold on though i don't see melons oh
dad that's it i love seeing a fourth
position or like just a strange position
scorpion
we still
we still won
but i love seeing a non-position one
scorpion it's just like you know they're
doing something cool i i'm being totally
sincere i respect the heck out of it man
um
okay so like
look we're not actually gonna get a
leveled up peacock
this will this will blow you away
i'm going full
sicko mode that's what the kids say
um
you just don't need it because you're
gonna just swallow a whole bunch of food
buffs right here so i'm i'm content oh
am i content
no let's do this
let's do this
work six times per turn
now we're talking man
thank you
oh this is what i meant to do sorry
sorry there we go
i would like to unfreeze you
i would like to get another scorpion
back
[Laughter]
uh or i don't know man what if you ran
like a
what if you royally screwed this up
and you like i'm i'm losing it okay you
combine me
you sell me
you still got some triggers left but
okay on seven
we put our peacock at the back
let's give give me
a wrap anything with good equipment goes
to the front
so we'll go rabbit
microbe
turtle
this should not work
but my methodology does make sense the
rabbit might do some damage early the
microbe comes in gives everything
weakness that's really bad except we
have a turtle that's going to save our
peacock at the end
but probably not but at the very least
you know we're experimenting we're in
the lab with a pen and a pad what you
think i sold them all that's a nightmare
that's a what is even happening
we're so close it it actually almost
worked
we needed like
five more hp on our peacock we come out
with a win there that was a really good
one though i had a great time if you did
as well click the like button helps out
a great deal
my little stint in pay to win tells me
ladybug beetle actually sick if you get
both of them especially
you buy food early instead of filling up
your squad with like paired units
you can do some damage in the mid game
it also tells me if you're on pay to win
and you don't get beetle or uh ladybug
well you know have fun
thanks for watching



let me let me go
let's pay out the the believers i want
to see i don't know if ludwig's still
here i know he's a busy man
i'm going to check out super auto pets
if you had to make
a winning run with only animals that
were in
the d tier let's see so in the d tier i
have placed lobster
chicken
llama squirrel goat hedgehog parrot
sauropod leopard duck
tabby cat crocodile mammoth pig horse
skunk seal is gross
but
i think as long as you can buy things
that are not in the bottom tier as long
as you sell them i think you could
actually get a chicken
uh
to make everything in your shop
incredible and then who cares if you're
uh if your animals are like dog [ __ ]
here as long as you have like 20 20s
when you buy them from the shop like
that i think that could work
i think it might take you a couple uh
might take you a a couple hours to get
the dream build but i think it could
definitely happen or llama i mean i
technically i think if you ran like four
llamas or something like that you might
just be able to pop but
all right i'm gonna run it back but i'm
telling you i'm gonna run it back free
to play
just so you know when you place your
bets here
i just uh
i i really like pay to win i love the
early game with the insects on pay to
win something about free to play just
tickles me man it just tickles me
i love look at this um you're such an
otter bro
i love it absolutely absolutely we do
this
four five two three
be the nefarious
presidents
also known as the president's heyo
[Laughter]
oh man
wow
horses and and crickets huh
i'm actually so upset we're drawing here
that's the best that a horse build can
do and it's literally just a draw
against all odds so like congratulations
big whoop the bro
i'm taking a chance here not adding this
otter just yet
you keep them both around
what the hell
you broke my eggshell man it's down
around my eyeballs
let's go
let's go
we draw these
you broke my head is this allowed
okay combine me
sell me because you're a piece
buy me
buy me
i don't mind the 5'4 aunt's a little
juicy man it's a little juicy we're
gonna buy uh the shop out here i love
the way this looks right now i guarantee
it i don't mind this at all i can't
believe we're at two draws though
what is this
what is
this
i mean like
what were you thinking
i don't i'm just
it's like i'm not mad or whatever i'm
just like like
like what were you thinking
and you know when you get a rabbit you
roll a lot of food that's that's a gimme
oh my lanta
straight up
toss me one of those i don't care if
we're rolling a four squad marty
we got a 10 13
fish on round four
it's a white bass
nice crab oh sorry oh tough luck rad at
the back he's ready to crack
thanks for the extra squad hey come on
over come to the winning team
mf looking like
hold on there's a joke in here somewhere
mf looking like lyanna in the last
episode of survivor you know what i mean
okay freeze me we're getting we're
getting some double fishes here
for double rabbits here we're getting
some double rabbits here
okay we can roll a swan in the future
now we got a 12 19 fish you throw some
garlic on that that's another two hp as
well
can you kill my fish nah but you can
hold this l
level one one one horse with meat on it
what are you talking about what are you
doing
sorry this is like really rude but at
the same time like come on um okay so
definitely that's just nasty man 12 21
fish
i'll be legit
to mit with you you got to kill this ant
life goes on we're gonna throw a little
crab back here because we got a 321.
i think you keep this going i think you
keep that going you look for meat for
your crab next turn and then you put a
kangaroo behind the crab or a dodo
behind the crab and you're kind of like
cruising here i told you we were playing
crab games i told you
i told you i was going to embarrass you
with this party barry
i'm you but stronger you gotta stop if
if today
we could learn anything you gotta stop
running horses man i'm telling you i i'm
not saying literally there is no
circumstance in which they don't they
won't work okay because everything i was
telling mouth i think if you have three
open spots 10 gold
dog [ __ ] shop you roll and you get horse
crap crap then okay you buy horse you
buy crap you buy crap at least they get
the buff but you should not be willfully
rolling horses i'm promising you should
not be willfully rolling horses
it's not the way the game is played
anymore
i mean i love a pair man but i'm a meat
is is even juicier but a monkey is even
juicier than that
holy bursh
okay this is this is incredible
i think you can freeze the kangaroo as
well this the doubters you're done like
you're
i'm i'm just telling you this out of a
sense of mercy like you actually are
done it's it's already over we got the
dream squad
uh
nothing is gonna stand in my way again
they're not even killing like my first
animal
you gotta go
you gotta show now we're gonna think for
a second we're gonna keep you frozen for
longer than most people would be
comfortable with but i promise you
there's a method to my madness
really really want to see meat i'm going
to go kind of deep for this i don't mind
this at all
i'm telling you people sleep on the on
the two ofs
they combine monkeys right off the bat
it's a mistake like like the men at work
song it's a mistake macros it's a
mistake
how is this a new meta
you never seen a large mouth bass before
for for the time being
no no no we could but no no no
for the time being
there's no reason to slot this kangaroo
in yet
i don't think there's a reason to buy a
fish quite frankly
two scorpions and he's done come on man
you really think i would tell you what
is this squad
what what are you do like i'm not
mad
i'm just saying
like it's like turn 10.
you can't just be buying a shark
slotting it at the back and being like
now they're toasted like you need you
need more you need more than this
he's already close to
maxson so the rabbit has been with us
since like turn three
i've been happy to have you
but the time has come we have no loyalty
here okay in this case in this unique
case
we will level you up honestly i
there's something to be said about a cat
quite frankly
but we're just gonna slot one of you in
for now we'll freeze you
right let's buff this you know what
what if we went big scorp man
this that was an accident but what if we
tried to roll big scorpion
like if we can get a scorpion that lives
long enough to kill more than one thing
that's kind of my dream
we might have to engineer some losses in
order to make sure that we
live long enough to make that happen and
also prosper long enough to make that
happen
it's not good enough
it's not it's come on man come on
oh
well
is the big show
okay 1515 scorpion up at the front
oh
tough luck
you're summoning one one rooster
holy crap
we actually had to use some of our other
animals here
i'm thinking
this is if we don't win this one
my entire game plan is just
feeding the crap out of this thing
it does not need melon okay
so if we die on this one that would be
good because our scorpion could get up
there man
what's even like happening that's a 49
dude i'm respecting the the build
respecter is logged on
did you see that 49 something whale that
was incredible
that was actually like i i'm not mad i'm
very impressed that was very cool
and i might add very legal
man it was so much easier to get like
big scorpion to pop than i thought it
would be like look at this thing very
shagadelic baby yeah
like look at this now a
43-43 scorpion up at the front the irony
is that what it loses to is a one-one
scorpion but still like
this is kind of sick
all right well actually like it doesn't
do as well as i wanted it to
as you can clearly tell i think this is
still 10 wins though scorpion at the
back
what the [ __ ]
is this allowed
all right so there's 10 wins
we'll pay out the believers on that one
i mean we're
i think people look at this and they say
like it sucks that the bets aren't 50
50. i see it like the opposite where i'm
like
the more people believe it actually is
creating like an eight to one
doubter paradigm where just maybe
just maybe
you're gonna get that payout it's just
juicy enough to
to make you want to believe
hold on just checking just checking
something okay
we're running it back
stop massaging it there's no massaging
no collusion
i should have i should have taken the
mosquito man i should have taken the
mosquito
i'm let's get crazy how's that doubters
hilly hikers i think and this is a joke
but i mean it i think that three ants is
bad
that being said we draw these
and then
da da
no mosquitoes please
oh
great minds think alike
oh man oh man the ant luck the ant luck
look at this
oops
okay well we're we're going to start
here

make some space you have to leave the
space
straight up like i mean you definitely
still roll a bunny

he said you know i'm nasty excuse my own
behavior right after that

that's a good freeze style it it's
pitchfork media said it was one of the
top 100 songs of 2007.
okay i don't know i might combine you
you're looking that juicy right now now
we got a four or five let's combine you
it's more fun that way
trash

turkey fly build i go okay congrats like
i get it this is your self-esteem
when i lose to honey badger i'm like you

we're gonna run it back will nell get
the six wins or more
i do love seeing a dolphin in a fedora
i mean it's been a believer's paradise
here man
early shop instant analysis tells me
this is 60
wind potential i love it i love it it's
loseable but it's gotta be you gotta go
up against like the
the the greatest gamers of all time

i'm gonna be brave man so we got this
four five in here i'm gonna be brave
i'm gonna say that this duck is not
gonna cost us the win
don't shoot my ant thank you
um and as a result the duck will serve
as very potent leverage for us in the
future that's beauty ant luck we take
those we take those
now we do a simple combine that gives us
a kangaroo we do a simple cell
everything gets stronger
we do a simple crab
with a kangaroo behind it
we can do this
we can do this okay you sell the otter
you play the dog
it's a two-two for now
but life comes at you fast
we should have kept the pig
should have kept uh this is big that's
very important
that's also extremely important okay
this round is gonna suck this round is
calculating at a 20
win rate
we'll take these we'll take these we'll
take these we're gonna win we're so
lucky we're going up against horses man
like i i'm i'm stunned i'm stunned that
we came out smelling like a rose on that
one why why you would run the horses is
beyond me
at this stage of your life like i guess
you just hate winning
so you're gonna sell me you're gonna buy
me
you're going to combine me our goal is
to get you to higher stats than the fish
then we can feel good about replacing
the fish you we know you're going to
want to have one of those
i mean we sort of have to um we got a
four four here
i mean these are good like buy me sell
me's next turn i'm never gonna sweat
those again this round kinda sucks okay
but next round next round is popping man
dare i suggest that it might even be
bing chilling
that's nasty this i mean this is a loss
we knew it could come we knew it could
come
but this is we we hit our scaling which
is nice
very nice very nice indeed you're gonna
combine me
uh very insanely nice indeed
you're gonna buy me
sell me we to see hp please

holy crap okay
um
now the squad be looking like this
garlic armor on the dog we're off to the
races man the shop got picked dry it

the grocery store in march 2020
sometimes you gotta take chances
plus two plus two yeah
thank you thank you or the video card
section of your local um electronic
store um at any point in the last 18
months heyo uh okay so now you don't
exist anymore you're not long for this
world hp please this this is a dream
shop right here hp please
well in this case
hp
okay we don't even need this last dog
man like that's crazy
i've never seen the dog hit level three
this fast
we don't even have garlic on it yet like
it's
i'm you but stronger like literally just
you but stronger
nice worm anybody up beating their worm
right now or just me
that's four wins
bison bison will be kind of sick right
now
honestly ain't nothing wrong with the
cow either
omg me
any meme that ends with omg me i'm a
very happy man
um
i mean i think the way you play this
honestly
something like this
you can laugh all you want okay cause
like
i really don't want our turtle to steal
a buff
check this out they don't make them like
this anymore
[Laughter]
five five monkey up at the front
here he goes oh he's trading he's
trading i can't believe it oh never mind
oh he's trading i can't believe it
all right this is looking pretty good
looking like a fool with your pants on
the ground got your hat turned sideways
jeans real low looking like a fool with
your pants on the ground
that's five wins feeling great feeling
great
in the eating good
in the neighborhood we still need to buy
man so like i'm willing to roll one time
to try to get a pill and that's it
you're gone you're going bye-bye
you need some garlic
can me just for future purposes
double monkey
ain't no doubt about that we're gonna
roll it like this for the time being
forget this dolphin
that that rooster is gonna pop in the
future man that rooster is gonna pop
emmy
this is from a place of like i'm your
friend
you can't do horses
they're not good enough
in the in if you have to run them in the
early game
do so but in the late game you cannot
run a horse like look at this it's just
they're the they need a buff honest i
feel like horses should be like one two
or one three that's how bad i think they
are right now
i'm gonna be straight up with you man we
have not needed a kangaroo hither to
this point so let's let's toss them out
of there let's throw a little rooster
into the mix
technically you could do the combination
but i think i'd rather get the roosters
starting to pop honestly this is how
much i respect them i have to be very
careful
because often times when i run
uh roosters i never take them so i
forget to
pay attention to them in the shop
sell crab
you lost your damn mind
you're the one who's out gobby out of
his mind have you lost your damn mind
we win these
pill crab
i mean the crab doesn't even it's not
even like doing anything but like it
might do something in the future
you got to give it a shot at least
looking for roosters not seeing roosters
i'm not seeing a rooster
at some point we're gonna run a
combinatorics
here
um
just people g write that down write that
down so we're gonna we're gonna store up
our beavers
what is that that's when you combine two
monkeys
that's that's what combinatorics is by a
skill difference the exact lethal
turns out my 18 one beats your uh 18 18.
or well ties it at least people g people
g okay there's eight wins feeling good
feeling good
i would like our dog to have more hp so
as annoying as this is
try something like this thank you so
much
buff the
whatever you buff i'm happy i'm a happy
man i'm just that kind of guy
now we're on round 11.
i'm a simple man
toss me one of these buff that dog's hp
thank you so much toss me a little
turtle in the middle roll me once
i see another monkey i'm a simple man i
see another monkey i'm very pleased
i do not mind i do not mind
okay okay
i'm a little scared of what this uh this
kangaroo can accomplish but i think our
dog just runs freaking wild on a man
this looks pretty good
turtle overriding garlic it's a it's a a
tactics change in the late game you want
you want the at some point and this
might be a little too early but i don't
think it is uh at some point you want
melon over garlic
you you buy this for three gold because
it gets you like 10 wins in the mid game
i'm just looking for a pill i don't see
a pill
you can you can run tiger rooster is a
little unimpressive
i'm gonna dice you for now i'm gonna buy
you give me some more hp thank you so
much
we didn't get a pill on our next one so
i feel justified
those who vibe are justified okay i'm
gonna i'm gonna level up the monkey here
i'm gonna roll a snake behind the crab
while we wait for our next rooster to
appear
it will happen it will happen and then
you freeze that for the future okay so
we're gonna replace the garlic with
melon next time permanently
you you overrode the steak on your own
rooster
you overrode the steak on your own
rooster
but why
okay nice oh look i've got melon armor
you go what
okay owns owns owns
owns
owns
sorry
i mean i can't even pretend like we lost
too early which was totally fair
but i do also need to note like
you'll never get dog luck like that in
the future
like we we got a dog and then like a
level two dog on the next turn and a
level three dog two turns after that
like it was just
i sometimes the shops just bless you
honestly
uh let me let me throw in a slash marker
here
and you know we we're gonna do react
court i promise you we're gonna do react
corn



but i mean
i'm looking at the leaderboards i'm
climbing the rankings of of super auto
pet streamers you know we gotta run back
another 47 minutes or so of super auto
pets
we're gonna switch to free to play
all right uh pay to win i mean we're
gonna switch to pay to win
which is it makes things a little
spicier
but we're still learning something on
pay to win i want to see this is what i
want to see thank you green me
green me what a cosmopolitan squad we
have here
it looks like the flag of eritrea
be the edible carrots
is rgb looking like a damn corsair
keyboard with your pants on the ground
we lose these well played
well played anonymous
okay one of these
one of these i'll be straight up with
you one of these
none of these you don't you i don't want
to go deep into the ant okay because i
think then you hesitate to pill it and i
want to make sure that i'm ready to do
what needs to be done later
good
okay we lose these i mean we draw these
we draw these
beauty step one
that's that's playable man
that's meta playable
you can definitely just slot this one in
like right here
roll me freeze me and then start we're
gonna start to talk about some foods in
the future we're gonna start to talk
about some foods
don't forget about pills as well oh this
is a pretty nasty squad man
that's horrible never mind it's totally
fine
i i don't see how we win we're going up
against like the most amazing teams i've
ever seen in my life now we got to scale
a little bit faster okay like these
teams are are popping off
it's gonna be a sell me
i can live with that it's not amazing
but i can live with it okay i'm gonna do
this i'm gonna say no to you for the
time being lord show me how to say no to
this i'm gonna show you how to say no to
this
we need okay
i'm gonna roll once more
rap me
four seven rat
i take your spot oh no i buffed the dog
let's go big plays
big plays
big plays let's go
we draw cause of the rat
cause of my own damn rat man are you
kidding me dude okay well one thing's
for sure you're getting the hell out of
here
you know what you can you can afford one
of these
it's a nice buff
get out of my face
get into my face garlic me that's huge
this is actually like a potential run
changer okay you know what if you're
gonna be a piece then get ready to
become a piece
we got no wins this is
disastrous this looks okay
that now garlic versus sheep is a very
good situation for us
now we're talking
that's a beetle man that's a beetle
hello chibli hello
hello nice to see you
hope you're having a good day
holy crap dude you gotta you gotta try
when you're like this you gotta try man
your chip your crab game minecraft squid
game stream was a lot of fun i enjoyed
myself immensely
i thought it had many wonderful moments
i hope you had fun in the stream as well
we win these
it was low-key really good it was a good
time it was a good time there we go two
wins two wins
finally
now we're freaking talking and chilling
up like
i need to buy you but simultaneously we
also need to win this round
like we're in full desperation status
right here on the bright side we got a
1717
ladybug and we're oh what the frick no
no no
it wasn't supposed to go down like this
is that it was literally me but stronger
and then they had crabs okay well we're
on we're on lethal here we're on lethal
here you gotta be careful
you gotta be mighty careful man
freeze me
it's the thinking man's move
honestly i think you gotta go
i think you gotta stay i think you gotta
get buffed you gotta buff this
bat a little bit i think that's our play
1717 with some weakness we got a six
seven fish bringing up the rear
i'm a little scared
but we do garlic does so well against
these like white weeny spawn builds
we win these thank you bat thank you
that's three wins okay keep it going
sheep at the front a little weird but
i'm just i'm telling you sometimes it
can be the right play
people don't want to believe it but
sometimes it can be the right play
i think you can swap out your fish
and throw a poodle in here three three i
don't really care what gets buffed
honestly
it's still very scary
i mean you
pretty much have to i honestly i think
you got to freeze this dang dragon
and then you got to start trying to pop
next turn
we need a turtle as well i think this is
how this is the only way we're getting
ourselves out of the doldrums here
2 18 18s
oh we're done
we're just done
that's a doubter payout
is for the first time today that's a
doubter pay up
we ran into some dirty squads man what
what can you say you know they they
started better they scaled better
and that that one goes out to everybody
who's like you got to change the wind
threshold check it out
why is dragon good every other stream i
watch hates it
um i probably have more time in the look
i'm not okay if you're talking about
richard hammer you have my respect and
my admiration
everybody else i probably have more time
in the game
than all of them combined
now and this shop is just a disaster by
the way but um
be the sizzling chunks sounds nice
what about justin
you know you put me in a tight spot
because i got nothing but respect for my
my friend justin
i i think the dragon is a sometimes buy
if you got the right squad it can it can
really hit
if you don't have the right squad it
kind of
kind of looks like ass for sure
kind of smokes like a
dukey cigar
interesting look i i'll never
wait we lose these
holy crap we just lost to a duck i don't
know what this i'm i'm
i'm losing my edge man i'm losing my
edge
okay can we get some dupes like this is
this is a disaster
but you know what if it's gonna be a
disaster
then let's make it a disaster
oh let's go okay and then freeze okay we
gotta win this round
and then this is our
this is our pivot round
don't care didn't ask plus you lost to a
rat don't shoot my aunt thank you did i
say a rat i'm in a duck let's say a rant
i meant a duck
okay easy wins easy wins
you know what we need we need a rabbit
to hit with this as well
okay good stuff dude you could roll a
dog here if you had to you could roll a
dog here
i think you you kind of have to try
screw it
screw it
is this what you wanted
here's what they think about you
i would guess we probably lose this
round
and probably the next one
but
maybe
at least hit
that made no difference
you were better off dead man
holy crap we're toasted by a single
kangaroo
whatever i've i've been i'm a believer
sorry if that offends you in the modern
era i saw what you did to chris pratt
i'm not going to let you do it to me
get me
we need it that's not what we want to
see
that's not what we want to see
we do because we're going for 10 wins
we're gonna buy a caterpillar that's
never bothered me um
you're gonna get sold so i hate i hate
to say it you're gonna get sold we gotta
buff you
as as sad as this looks
this is our squad i can't believe it
eight seven dog round five we're in a
we're in a tight spot man
well
we do beat the eight eight oh uh what my
whole squad
rip my whole damn squad
all right we'll pay out the doubters on
that one
star prediction run it back
life comes at you fast man that we got
dumpstered there we need that's the you
need the space
to pivot
that is only guaranteed to you
when you have a decent early game like
if you go o2 in the early game
you're like on real disaster eras
let's be the magical teapots
so we just a draw would be fine i would
i would not mind a draw
buff me juice me we win even better i'm
sorry paddington sorry
maybe drown your your sorrows with a hot
cup of earl grey tea and some raspberry
marmalade down at covent gardens
give me a fish
i'll take a second fish
and then i will buff you slightly
because it also buffs you two four holy
with the new schedule is the canadian
section gone who's gonna tell him
sips and mouth were here not more than
one and a half hours ago we fished for
two hours we played a fishing battle
royale
i'm not going to say i have a 100 win
rate but
i'm not not saying it
we draw those
okay here's where the fun starts
combine me
this is a buy
because they'll both get the buff after
we do this
i think it's also a freeze
are we are we really willing to do this
i'm going to say the answer to this
question
is yes
we're going to buy a peacock even though
it's ass
and we are not going to buff it because
it's ass but we're gonna do this then
you'll become three fives
i love it i love the way this went
we got a little lucky
it's okay
we do a long it's oh what the no no no
no no i hate this skater boy i said see
you later boy
okay now we combine
we buy
portal is a dream come true
nothing wrong with the turtle man
play the turtle here peacock i sleep
i'm ready to kick that peacock out the
damn squad
like can i help you
you know what i'm gonna buff it
let's get weird let's try something like
this like this like this
i come in 645 peacock stepping out the
damn shower like can i help you
i looked that animal dead in the window
of his soul
and i said oh come on what is it how do
you get
how do you get your swans to be two like
seven eight swans how do you get two
seven eight swans this early
i don't believe it i simply it doesn't
compute
i don't buy it
get out of my face you're i'm in your
face um we need garlic and i think that
it's gonna look
a little bit like
i honestly think you just put it on the
fish man
sorry turtle you had your chance
three four
i'm we're gonna run an economy build
i wouldn't expect you to have heard
about it in your classrooms
please please
this is going to be tight
that one doesn't matter it's going to be
tight
it's going to be tight
it's going to be tight
it's not going to be tight we have
definitely lost
choose outcome
we have been defeated
we have one more we have one more hold
on i almost paid out the doubters there
hold on man that would have been a
disaster
combine me combine me
not going to happen anytime soon
you want to win some rounds
yeah i want to win some rounds
honestly like it's early enough for the
buff to work i'm just scared
give me a bat for the future
if you know we're kind of
we're kind of stuck here momentarily
okay
this will work man this will work
level 3 chick is crazy source just trust
me average win rate 4.4 uh wins per
non-abandoned lobby
there we go
give me that win
level three chick gives experience to
the animal in front of it
while you were still learning to spell
your name
i was being trained to conquer galaxies
i'm familiar all it takes is what 15
gold well one two three says nine and
then three more
18 gold and you too for 18 gold can turn
your hatching chick into a worse monkey
okay i'm sorry now that was a little bit
that was dismissive and i apologize i'm
just saying people don't put enough
respect on the hatching chick as it at
its original level
for three gold a five five plus garlic
armor your your farming winds you're
farming them
baby is very unhappy right now by the
way
okay let me think for a second here
this can win one more round you don't
need to slot a rhino in here just yet
okay i'm gonna
i'm gonna do a half measure
it's gonna look like that
no
no
okay the fish is not long for this world
the rhino is literally a better swan i
must have missed the text on the rhino
oh frick
i must have missed the text on the rhino
where it says uh uh gives one gold every
turn they must have added that in a
recent patch
okay pay out the doubters look i'm
rolling this until we get a believer win
on pay to win
we're sticking this one out
bring me back
now this is a winnable squad
something like that
get some space in the early game to to
get the scaling in the mid
game i'll be the submissive citizens
not me i'm a i'm a warrior on facebook
okay this is somebody who is going for
10 wins but
does not want to get uh
one win
by me
roll me
i mean this is kind of sick i honestly
think you play this
and this and you freeze that this is
kind of like a dream shop quite frankly
i don't i don't know if there was a
wrong way to play that
pretty much i i will call that roughly
equivalent
see if there's some ant difference here
we draw these
we draw these
could not connect to the server
this is really nice
we want one of those because we want to
get the level up
this is
really nice
this is really nice
i'll level with you like i like an ant
but
to to get us to puppy scaling
i don't even mind if it throws around
and it might oh that's so lucky dude
it's so lucky
and then we got
actually extremely lucky on the
the ant buff as well like that that
could have gone many different ways i
think we just we we got the doctor
strange build on that one
okay okay
um i still think you can roll a bunny
and scale your puppy faster
why not
we can spend two more gold which is not
good so we'll go for some rolls honestly
like i'll freeze you but i kind of doubt
you're gonna stick around freeze me one
of these unfreeze me i don't see our
fish sticking around i my dream is that
we replace our whole squad with
caterpillars
just one puppy four caterpillars
it's a very interesting
early melon armor
i'm not even being a hater like it was
kind of it had me scared for a second
there
s three
imo a little late for a dog that's just
an imo though give you one of those i'll
be honest with you i think i'm gonna
give you one of these
then we'll start to talk about like are
we gonna sell a bunny to fit something
else in this build the answer is no
we'll freeze a bad for the future i
think we could totally freeze the salad
i think dude i'll be honest i think we
can freeze a second bunny
all of a sudden we got a 912 garlic
armor puppy up at the
front garlic armor garlic armor doing
very well
against some sheeps
not sweating that in the slightest nice
kangaroo just kidding
okay so far so good that takes us to
four we're feeling good
you know when you win early
you get the space
to fit these rabbits then you just do a
little munch munch on the salad then you
do a little munch munch on the salad oh
baby
roll one time keep that bad frozen i'm
happy to see it wouldn't mind seeing the
garlic on our mosquito quite frankly and
then we'll scale the puppy we're out of
12 17 now
it's looking good it's looking good
we like it
we like it
uh oh you didn't even summon a rat man
there's five wins
give me a salad
i don't mind it honestly our bats gonna
live longer than our mosquitoes so why
don't you take some garlic armor why
don't you enjoy your scaling
don't see anything i particularly like
ah
i think you just send it all of a sudden
1419 garlic armor puppy
i'll accept that shot this this is the
first time
things have gotten a little scary
just kidding all right so that's six
wins
some point we're gonna want to put you
out there
okay send me
it was a little scarier
not scared
oh lucky me yo we still we still get two
big boys up at the front you love to see
it
uh
bad hello mouth dude this now this is a
squad now if you came in at like exactly
the right time people will try to tell
you we were sucking pretty badly for
like 15 minutes just recently
don't believe their lies
okay i honestly i think the mosquitoes
got to go
i think you throw in a caterpillar i
think we have the time
might as well buy this puts us at a good
amount of gold
just start buying cans so you get some
like 20 20 scorpions or something oh
okay this is a loss unless that hit you
with the right spot but it didn't
how do you have a t-rex already
are we that late in the game that
someone could have a t-rex
i suppose
that's a gamer right there
okay three you're a three as well so
this is
it's not a and you're a three this is
not a great poodle build unfortunately
keep that puppy scaling
i'm a simple man
keep that puppy scaling roll me once
more
this scorpion is gonna is gonna stem the
tide
please
anti-please technology
this is fine we kill their first three
units their last three units are nothing
you're nothing i've trained
classically obtained i've trained
contemporaneously
the snail would have been better
better than what
better than what
i ask you better than what
better than being at eight wins at round
11 i don't think so agree to disagree
give me some foods
combine me
place me
roll me
freeze me
roll me
freeze me
i can't believe we haven't gotten a
puppy to the next level yet though
okay okay i see i see your game plan i
see your game plan i think we got bad
bad luck there
and we're gonna lose as a result but
yeah
that's okay if dude if our bat had just
hit like any unit with melon armor we
might have had a chance there
okay scorp i'd i'd like to bring you
back but for the time being
you gotta go i hate to say it but it's
true you for the time being you gotta go
roll me
sell me
five buy me
two more minces
i mean milk says
move you to the back
should have frozen should have frozen
we had to sell the cow so we ended up on
two gold to continue scaling the puppy
dude i'm i don't want to be the guy
who's saying like all bad luck bad luck
you got to admit though the luck with
the
the melon armor plus the bat has been
kind of poopy so far
we're going to get toasted here we got
one more of this double crab metaman
okay now we're all in
caterpillar's one away god i would love
to see you freaking pop man i think i
think we're rolling for a caterpillar
we can freeze the scorpion i think we're
rolling for caterpillar turtle
is the dream
and i'm going all in on on this
now i'm realizing it's not we don't have
enough left to make it work
i think it's a little late for the t-rex
that's just an imo a lot of people you
know uh
maybe they watch other streamers they
might consider that that's like a
guarantee i'm a disbeliever in that
personally but no no no no no freeze me
freeze me freeze me unfreeze me freeze
me buy me
let's go i don't know if that changed i
was so scared
i was so scared okay
then
forget your scaling
live to the next round natural
caterpillar scale
this is gonna do it man
hold on hold on
big plays
we're chilling
chilling
chilling
easy wins easy wins take your question
marks shove them in a sack there's nine
wins
caterpillar pop naturally
freeze me there's a play here
turtle me all we want is a turtle
there's literally i don't care about
level three puppy i don't care about the
bunny all we care about is a turtle
you sell
the bunny
you run a microbe
hold on this is so pissed you don't need
a bad anymore because you're gonna have
a microbe so you sell the bad
you run this and this okay now
get ready this is what it's all about
they don't teach you this one at super
auto pet school okay
this is how we roll it it looks jacked
up
this is my design
no melons no melons no melons
bro you didn't even get to my butterfly
like that's actually like what happened
this is my design nobody believed
all right actually 70 percent of people
believed it's the thing whenever you get
10 wins if you roll something unusual
people in chat are like no chance no
shot no shot dude
then you win and they're like why can't
i go up against these teammates uh
because you don't make it to round 14
because you're rolling ducks and horses
like a damn fool
you got no imagination okay
you're only a mimic a mockingbird
you hear something on the stream you try
to run it in your game
you gotta use the prefrontal cortex not
just the cerebellum okay
anyway we got one more we're going to
roll
free to play on this one
we're going to roll free to play
because it's stronger quite frankly
although we did get i mean we have four
or five ten wins today all you
i can't i can't
but i must
but if there's no mathematically
good will hunting style
it cannot win
it cannot win round one
but on the other hand
what if
what if
we roll three pigs and then piggy is in
the name
what if we roll
what if we roll three pigs
what if we roll four pigs
freaking sticky sailors man
okay well there's no chance it's just
not possible you knew that was coming
what's the windows snip tool uh
shortcut have you ever seen something as
disrespectful as this
unfreeze me
freeze me
roll me you're not gonna give me a pig
on this one
what's wrong
surf and turf [ __ ]
i'm so sorry if you're a believer right
now like this is just a mess
a lot of it is outside of my control
we draw these hey hey we draw these we
draw these that's okay we're one loss
one loss
that's not so bad
what are you gonna eat
tina you fat lard come get some dinner i
mean i gotta buy you
[ __ ] it
sure
sure you know what you know what sure
sure
you know what sure sure yeah true that's
true the thing is though i think i'm
gonna put my um i think i'm gonna put my
fish at the front
so that at least my fish doesn't die
just by getting hit two times
by the hedgehog
and my swan
i don't see how this could go wrong
holy [ __ ] their squad is so not tanky
is gonna work it's actually gonna work
okay
incredible now just tank up all your
units
tank them up
man tank them up okay now
now you can go back
put you back there
why not man why not
oh you know we should put a second
hedgehog in there that now we're talking
freeze me
could have done that differently that's
okay i don't know man this is kind of
stupid but i kind of love it
it's not new meta i'm i'm stealing this
meta from dick hammer
this is a little scary now
there's some scariness
never mind we win these
okay there's definitely a way that you
could make a turtle work on this build
um
there's there's definitely also
something you could do with a badger
here i don't know maybe you just put it
oh you can't really put it at the back
because it's gonna get killed by the
hedgehog but just let me think for two
freaking seconds okay
i definitely think giving everything
plus one plus one is gonna be nice even
if we're not gonna roll this dude i
gotta be honest with you i think a
dolphin is kinda gonna slap
sniping something with low hp to
guarantee that it also dies the headshot
that seems really good
are you i'm going to dump the fish
i'm then going to put a dolphin
on this squat but i'm just wondering if
first
it might be good to turtle
like to get melon armor on something
maybe our
pig
so that it would be a 7-5
but are we we're probably gonna sell the
pig at some point you know what for now
the swan is fairly likely to stick
around for a moment here
try something like this
yeah yeah yeah
there's something about an ox here like
i feel like if you put an ox
behind the whale
it would always have melon armor when it
gets hit and then it would get another
melon armor as well like maybe you could
roll an ox instead of a pig or something
like that i don't know
i don't know what i'm doing
but it's really funny okay sure level
three pig
garlic will also slap here
okay
i don't know this is good but
their squad is not that tanky it's not
that tanky their peacock's gonna
freaking smack
but then your whole squad's dead
and then i just kill you okay so there's
that
three wins
um
i would love if you spit out a stronger
hedgehog i really would let's level you
no no no that you don't you're too good
for this build okay you're you don't fit
in
roll me
it's an easy turn
roll me
i mean dude i gotta be honest
i'm kind of loving the idea of selling a
dolphin and rolling a blowfish garlic
get out of here you stink
that badge is going bye-bye man
nice try
what the hell is an endless cascade
we lose these you peace you peace
okay well done strange build but well
done
holy crap
i can't not man
i can't not but it's it's so bad cause i
i cannot fit the blowfish in the squad
yet you got to hear me out here okay
it'll well hold on you actually kind of
can all right
can me
buff me
you're gonna die
you're gonna do four damage
the pig is gonna die
unless we buff it
it sells so well you gotta sell the pig
it has it now we have 12 gold to work
with now this means because you're gonna
do four
and then you're gonna do two
so we're gonna make it do two and then
one you're gonna be okay
i'm just thinking
i don't really want a turtle here i
think we need a can for future purposes
but let's freeze it for now
you're gonna go to eight you won't die
you're gonna be kinda ass but
i agree i'm gonna freeze the skunk
because it's kind of interesting
i would love to win this one man
okay oh what the hell
uh what the uh what the no no no
turn it off turn it off
hey hey no no
hey don't stop it
holy crap no
me him hit me
oh
son of a
all right dolphin you you had your
chance okay
this really helps
dude
[ __ ] you
honestly swan like you had your chance
okay like
it's gonna work it's gonna work
oh what the hell they got garlic too
oh son of a
oh they got a badger in the middle
though that's incredible
that
oh what the hell
we draw these we draw these
okay okay okay okay
okay a third blowfish please
a second hedgehog please
i mean we gotta at least freeze you
i don't know where you put it but
oh man
what the heck
what
i feel like if i build this wrong i'll
accidentally kill my whole team
dude actually can i tell you something i
think you move this hedgehog back one
and then we have this guy eat
a level one instead to trigger two
blowfish hits
and then give you a little bit more hp
this is so stupid but you know
something something about this
something tells me i'm into something
good
i don't know your squad doesn't scare me
that bad
yet
nice b just kidding
oh my god
what the heck is this allowed
we win these
it's actually kind of sick
i'm chilling
i don't know man let's toss you in here
for now
i don't know oh i showed the whale
ah whatever we'll get another one
easy come easy go in this world
um
it's a level one spits it out as a level
two
sure why not
i don't know like i don't expect this to
live anyway
this doesn't seem great
the hippo seems like it's gonna run like
buck wild on us
yeah
all right well it was fun while it
lasted
we still got four wins which is actually
kind of impressive but
all right dude that was that was a great
time
that was one of these days that's gonna
pop and it's
it's gonna be a lot of fun but for now
i'm going to run some ads and i'm going
to go to the bathroom and then we'll do



all right so you know we've uh my
prophecy has come true
it took a little longer than expected
but
i play super auto pits i introduced it
to all my friends i introduced it to
some big streamers that have a lot of
influence they have a good network they
all become addicted to it all of a
sudden before you know it i'm not saying
it's the next among us i'm not saying
it's the next among us it might be
the current among us
if you know what i mean
if you know what i mean um
but here's the thing okay we've solved
free to play free to play is solved
whoops probably still play some i'm in
the process of trying to solve
pay to win and i think i got a formula
for pay to win that does well ready to
ruin the game yet again hope you enjoyed
your crab meta this weekend
saw so many crabs this weekend i felt
like i was at um
a crab restaurant
many people are saying this um what did
i do with um with my crabs uh when i was
when i saw so many crabs running against
me i started running triple the
quadruple scorpion build and i gotta
tell you
it freaking slaps it destroys crabs
now you run three scorpions at the front
two big heavy tanks at the back
you kill their tanks their crabs are
useless against your 5050s nice 450. oh
sorry yeah yeah let's get the casino
going here let's get the let's open up
the dang casino number one super auto
pets royale yeah pay to win we're about
to get down get down just took out the
beetle town
my crab just got downed
i'll upgrade him now he's going meat
bound
um anyway sorry here we go
um
you know what i also realized this
weekend it's like a damn crime as we
play as the uh the sizzling
sausages it's a damn uh crime that
there's no bear in this game there's no
panda there's no koala there's no
grizzly there's no polar bear
that's crazy man
okay i like it i like it we roll once we
get bees i do not like it
you know what we can roll juan mosquito
fit one mosquito into this build
expansion pack two maybe yeah yeah
expand an expansion pack too
dlc bear hopefully it's a nasty squad
their mosquito mosquito difference you
hate to see it their mosquitoes sniped
our
our ants you hate to see it
by the way we win these
okay so far so good we've done our part
we've done what needs to be done
um you definitely are gonna
give me a level
i'm not a huge fan of a tier three of a
tier three level three tier three level
one puffer fish um but it's not it's not
the end of the world you could freeze it
for a moment while we while we do the
thinking i think if you're gonna do it
you gotta do something like this
i'll i'll level with you i think we
freeze this i think we meet
the beetle to make our puffer fish
better
freeze the pill buy the puffer fish roll
once
i accept this
i accept this
i i added meat to the beetle to buff the
blowfish for plus one plus one it's like
adding meat to the beetle with a little
apple kicker alongside it
oops
nine eight mosquito oh
we're so lucky dude we're so freaking
lucky but look at that that's 3-0-3-0
dude can i tell you something as well i
don't even know if i should mention this
because it's you know sometimes someone
is like oh i've got a million dollar
idea
and then you hear it and it's like you
know
what about a brake pedal that's like
when you just want to slow down a little
bit and not a lot you know you're like i
don't know about that one that seems
like it's going to lead to some
confusion
um
kate told me a million dollar idea
that's actually a billion dollar idea
do you know how much it would slap
if nintendo slash niantic
released a pokemon skinned
super auto pets style like battle royale
it seems so insanely trivial to develop
you have all the art already it's
already cute
the the mechanics make perfect sense
they just you know you level up when it
gets to level two it takes a second
evolution or maybe it's third evolution
tier six animals could just be
legendaries or something like or maybe
the legendaries are things that don't
evolve to begin with it would it would
make a billion dollars man it would make
a billion dollars
anyway i'm just saying i'm just i'm just
throwing it out there we're gonna peel
this ant
yummy yummy
um i'm gonna buff the fish it's a bit
spooky but
whatever
for now
i'm gonna do that
i'm gonna freeze this
i'm gonna roll
i'm gonna freeze this and i'm gonna roll
and i i gotta be honest with you i think
bats are great but i
well we don't wanna freeze a little shop
in that case in that case get out of my
face you bad
bats are sick but i don't wanna um
i'm trying to go like bat-less lately
okay their crab is not all that in a bag
of potato chips
unfortunate but life goes on
uh we crush you we crush you i got mouth
if you're if you end up watching this i
gotta tell you man you can't roll horses
man you can't
they're not and it's not like i hate to
see a horse is that i hate to see my
friend use a horse because they're like
they're so bad
anytime i see a horse i'm like we're not
losing this we might draw probably not
but
okay you could roll you could fit a deer
into this squad i think it's early
enough that you could totally just just
send something like that and feel pretty
good about it and we're only on tier
five
or turn five i should say
this looks pretty good
you know we get two kills right here
crush the whale that's no sweat
crush you here no turtles please
whale is no biggie
we absolutely destroy your kangaroo and
then i mean that wasn't even close
now i don't think we should invest in
our mosquito and i don't think we should
invest in our blowfish
i think i think this is a full reroll or
maybe just you know what i think you
could sell mosquito replace with a swan
for a second just for some economic
buffing
uh
it's it's not too late for a caterpillar
this is a nice late game buff if things
start to go wrong i do think it's a
touch late for a puppy uh oh a garlic is
like i mean it's a dream
you kind of want it on the beetle to be
honest but
it is what it is let's put it on the
fish for a moment here um okay it's not
ideal i think
i hate to say the the
crab game tweet is clickbait
but it's not clickbait because we're not
playing a game with the crab in it it's
click bait because we're playing pay to
win which has no crabs
okay i'm the the ram kind of sick don't
you really it's turn six you're running
a level one horse like that just makes
me upset
that you like why would you do that
if if you had at least a level two horse
i would be like okay you're like
you're going for it
okay you still go i mean if you're if
we're at six wins in six rounds we're
going like
we're going for heavy investing might as
well i honestly think we could buy a can
here because we're gonna replace some of
these units at some point
it's funny it's like like we we could
definitely take a bison but the only
thing is like a bison
uh
like might not get to go because we
might be at 10 wins by then
freeze me freeze me
roll me
come on
roll me
if you'll excuse me we have a
where's my where's my bison denny
where's my bison denny
where's my bison denny
sad i'm not resetting the bed don't
don't make me laugh
what your windows boots up in like a day
and a half
lobster are you kidding me
you know what
it was worth a try
i can't hate i can't hate you for that i
we're we're still chilling bing chilling
not not being chilling we lose these we
lose these it's all going wrong man it's
all going wrong now
all because we got uh the server broke
i actually the goat is so bad i tried to
sell it from the
from the shop i was gonna be like just
sell but obviously that's not how that
works um i'll be straight up with you
like i love a swan i think if we're
going for early wins which is where this
squad should be right now we actually
are just going to garlic
or the garlic fish is going to get a
hatching chick attached to it
and then we're gonna roll for for great
success
sure
sure
i honestly think this is a win now build
i don't think we we pick up a worm even
though there's some interest there i
don't think we level up our hatching
chick at all i genuinely think this is
like a win now marty
these are some nasty squads man
man you just wrecked my whole team huh
nicole smiley face
[Laughter]
send me
don't make me laugh
okay so
a lot of people will probably tell you
is not the best idea to like invest in a
fish
those people are what we in the business
call doubters
1617 fish garlic armor we don't want to
see hippos please
we do see a hippo but it's slightly back
in the
in the rotation ah this is a disaster
we're going down
i got guns to my head i think i'm going
down i can't believe it's happening in
my hometown
okay this is problems are starting to
form
see ya
hello is it me you're looking for now
i've been rolling like some cheekiness
okay
give it a sec we're just i'm i'm the
thinky right now
one of the things i think is cheekiest
is
placing a scorpion in the middle of your
build a lot of people build melon at the
front to get around the front scorpion
so you put a scorpion in the dang middle
and
and then we wipe yeah
we wipe you up we wipe you
that takes us to seven we're doing a
little anti-meta here that takes us to
seven
now we got the full on caterpillar is
gonna be a 15 15.
you know what let's let's take it one
level higher shall we
roll me once
i think garlic can can work for one more
round
give me a give me a juicy little steak
on the hatching chick is is very spicy
don't get me wrong
i would like a turtle to to fit in
freeze the melon there will be more
where that came from excuse me uh your
bat has ruined my scorpion you peace
that's that's pretty bad well anyway
still
look at this
we still pay out the believers honestly
i felt like we were cruising
until we ran into uh
that that server desync i i fully blame
the server desync
were it not for that we would have been
fine
start my prediction will we get the six
wins in a row when when the bison got
rolled it screwed us up man that's that
that's all i'm gonna say about that we
were doing fine until we lost that
i like it give me a two three give me
give me green and red ladybugs oh
that's what we're talking about
i love a food build
i love the idea of a precious president
like oh look at that
oh look at him he's so precocious
um this is i double mosquito ant is
really good
it's very good
we draw these and i'm happy to draw them
quite frankly
food meta food meta food meta you know
exactly what's up
this this is food meta man
i will
a bee is fine i'd rather have an apple
a
so what do you do it's so simple you
start what this is what changes the game
you ready for this you ready for this
we get a three four
two two fours and then our fish is a two
four as well would you look at this
how how does this squad lose
on turn two when you have a three four
two four two four two four two three uh
basically a default fish is your worst
thing i don't think so you're not going
you're not going down you might draw
draws happen all the time
but you're not going down
look at that
bee works totally fine there in in that
situation
absolutely but
this is a beautiful build this is a
beautiful build we've got going on here
now we summon a rabbit to the to the to
our side
honestly i love a little meat
i'd rather give him garlic
let's give him a little
six eight now we're talking are are we
talking or are we talking a little six
eight
i don't respect i think this fish is not
long for this world
six eight two four two four two four
three two maybe if she's five foot two
okay math is bad for us to start with
but
yeah we we lose these
honestly it's a great team
it's a great team it's a great team i
can't be upset it's a good team
um
give me a sell me
buy me
bat me
i know i said we were rolling battles
life comes at you fast
freeze me
buy me
freeze me
you're close to a freeze me but dude
look at this we got a 812 3535 and a one
four bed
we don't we don't lose these three
mosquitoes what's wrong with you
what's wrong with the mosquito that was
not the way we wanted that one to go
down but alas here we are we win these
check this out
kaminsky
now we got two seven bad oh
two seven bat with some meat could
actually do some damage
here's the thing i'm a simple man i
think you would help us out a lot but
salads holy birch
salads can do some work for us here too
three nine bad
you gotta dump that ladybug soon source
dude i just trust you i think you're
probably right
i think you're probably right
we win these though we win these
this is some this is some niceness
very interesting i don't know how it
works on on pay to win
level one level one level two level
three it's a must buy and then you're
right the beetle must go at some point
honestly i think you replace the
the ladybug i should say you replace the
ladybug with uh
a rooster for the time being
and then we got a one two three four
five four four four four him me him him
me
this is totally fine we'd rather the
rooster get buffed over the poodle for
now at least i think okay we need garlic
on our beetle this squad is now a little
bit jacked up for the future but
or not for the future really for this
round and this round alone
this seems okay
we get through the first spider
ram ram difference
just want to see the dog get like no
more hp we win this we win this
we win this no
sweat we goose them a little bit what's
that four winds no sweat
sheeps on sheeps on sheeps on sheeps
straight up man i'm like
don't get me wrong at all
i like a rabbit which is why we're going
to go like this please do not feed my
rabbit we're going to freeze a poodle
for a second
we're going to put some garlic on you
it's probably not too late for a
caterpillar but it it leaves a bad taste
in my mouth from the last time
you get out of my face you get into my
face
[Laughter]
no you see the hit me him in me
oh that's that's huge that's
that's huge
then we trade with the crab and then you
just be honest man you got nothing you
got nothing back there
i mean you gotta add a rooster to the
equation we can add a bat to the
equation
i'm not doing anything with these
poodles till i see
more poodles would be nice but okay we
got level two 910 rooster which is
actually going to be like an 11 12 11 12
rooster
oh baby
this looks fine
kangaroo is probably the best animal to
get hit by that
i worry we're cruising man
we are cruising here
how did he even discover this game again
it's actually like i you know like you
just have moments in your life
that are like
lightning strikes i was just on steam
didn't know what to play
probably 2 000 people in chat going
isaac isaac isaac i was just scrolling
and i saw something that said super auto
pets free to play let's give it a try
played a few rounds and i went uh you
know what this is pretty fun virenzo
thanks for the
uh
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
they'd rather they'd rather see me in
the pen than me and virenzo rolling in a
benzo i've said many times um
i played a little longer i said you know
what this is really fun and the rest is
history can i tell you something as well
i saw on twitter i've never been a big
bruno mars fan okay i've never been a
big bruno mars fan
um but somebody
tweeted
they didn't have to do them this dirty
on the new bruno mars song
it's not out yet but the music video is
out yet i think it is kind of crazy man
it goes kind of hard
it's is what is it smoking out the
window is that what it's called it's
silky man
like uptown funk i've kind of heard so
much that i would rather
like
never hear it again quite frankly but
dude that he's kind of bringing it on
that track huh anyway sorry sorry
we're still going
or like you're amazing just the way you
are like that i kind of hit the snooze
button
but like
his new stuff man i don't know man i
don't know
it's kind of it's kind of sick it's kind
of legit huh
well let's let's get the rooster buffed
here freeze one of these just in case
that's it just in casey freeze one of
these for the future honestly i'll buy
one of these
unfreeze me an apple
it's because of anderson pock i'm gonna
be honest with you i have heard his name
before prior to this song i thought he
was one of those guys that um
when you go to like a music festival
he's in the uh
he's in like a little like box
and he goes
i thought like that i didn't know he was
a singer
i thought he was just kind of one of
those guys that goes like you know
respect to his family
i thought he was like that
i i had to the best of my knowledge i
had never heard anything he had done
prior to that
anyway sorry i'm
taking way too much time here
that's freaking huge um
toss me one of these real quick
yes okay
freeze me forget a dragon man i snooze
on a dragon
a tongue kissa piranha
as ll cool j said on the flavor in your
ear remix
and we have zero losses so far that's
kind of that's kind of pog freeze me one
of these
frees me one of these this is like uh
it's a weird sell me by me but just
trust me okay do you trust me
incorrect you're a one loss
i don't think so tim
that's a tough one
oh yeah we're at one loss my bad
is it true that the default um
uh that well the test build is going to
put you on
10 lives in defaults
that's gonna make it so super auto pets
goes from like
a 15-minute game to like a 45-minute
game and i don't mean it in a bad way
it's just gonna have a catastrophic
a huge shift to the meta ducks might be
takeable oh but you take three lives
late in the game oh
very interesting
very interesting teamwood games i see ya
i see you're trying to keep everybody
happy
i mean this is a gimme man you roll like
that uh
okay fine you piece we roll like that
so that we get the scaling properly done
yeah welcome welcome
oh
baby it just dawned on me how good that
is
um
okay they got a great build we want to
get rid of that melon armor mission semi
accomplished
that hurts
jokes on you i got my own freaking
rooster we win these
you
that takes us to eight yo dan the thx
sound experience welcome
welcome daniel happy to have you here
hope you're enjoying your day
i'm going to be honest you might not
enjoy this we can't level the the t-rex
just yet
never mind we can level
with three lives
we can level the t-rex
even if we don't get the it's it's worth
losing the scaling on this turn
to set up the the scaling on our next
turn for double because we have three hp
we can take it
my goal today is to win 10 with only
d
tier list
entries and and below
i'm trying to think about
the plausibility of what you're
projecting here
we lose these but it's close
um
so in the d
i'm
i'm trying to think about
what could make a viable build
croc
leopard
horse early could could start to get you
there seal if i think if you got the
perfect build you could maybe make seal
working or something
do i mind speaking english
i think something like that could get it
done
i think seal could pop maybe but yeah i
mean you're you're dealing with borrowed
time back there
leopard i dude i've seen so much tiger
leopard is actually kind of like a
top-tier snipe build in the in the era
of crab
now that we have a t-rex i'm very much
eager to possibly get rid of a poodle
and run a scorpion instead but we're not
going to do it yet we're going to take
our scaling for this turn
we're going to get rid of our poodle
we're going to roll a scorpion
in one of those early positions and uh
oh sorry
literally just ruined your scorpion
sorry about that it happens
chili pepper on a dodo tell me you hate
winning without telling me you hate
winning
i don't see why you don't do it right
off the bat
give me one of those and you know i look
i'll just tell you straight up
oh baby
i just like
this
i just like a freaky little
scorpion not at the front i just think
because if they have melon armor at the
at the front it screws it and this works
out beautifully for us we got a little
lucky but still
my my word that's 10 wins right there
i'm telling you middle scorpion is is a
juicy little
it's a juicy little technique
i have no mathematical sense on whether
you do middle two three or four but it's
kind of funny
i also i've been thinking about like if
you want to go freaking crazy man what
if you ran like back scorpion one up
no that's horrible you have a one one
that doesn't poison it dies and comes
back as a one one with poison
and then the best it can do is draw
really
you can one-up scorpion like what about
a one-up scorpion at the front
does one damage pop smell in armor
respawns with death touch oh it doesn't
even have poison when it comes back all
right never mind never mind
never mind
disregard it i thought it would get
poison when it came back but um
slash marker
sap i rule
let's just call that sap one for
administrative purposes
i'm trying to you know



hey everybody i'm back and uh
ready to continue learning some new pay
to win tech okay
it's not anytime you see a fish you
can't be mad in free to play i would
probably
take a beaver knowing it's right around
the median
of good units in my opinion for turn one
in pay to win i think the early game is
pretty sick i would love green red green
red you honestly are like a little bit
of a piece but that's okay we're gonna
end our turn here with this nasty squad
um i'll be the sizzling piggies
sizzle like bacon kind of makes sense i
i honestly put myself up there
in the name game with just about anybody
i i feel like uh
my naming conventions are i wouldn't say
unparalleled but paralleled only by the
very best
it's an interesting start right can we
pivot to a ladybug or would we rather
roll a second beaver i think we can buy
a ladybug roll once
now this is this is very curious now
this is curious indeed
um
i'm going this is rare okay i'm gonna
sell a beaver
now you might accuse me of trying to
shoehorn a meta here and i think he
would be right but i'm gonna squeeze a
beetle in there i'm gonna freeze you i
don't care for you i'm going to freeze
you
my hope is that um this will let us
maybe we'd lower our chances of winning
this round a little bit due to
inefficient use of our resources um
this squad honestly isn't that scary i
don't know what happened with their
otter that being said we still lose
these but only by one i i guess their
otter would just ended up being spread
out it's funny if we have a five one or
a one five we make that a little
surprising but um
i think we buy i think we
combine
i think we buy
puppy is very takeable
and then i think you acknowledge
as part of the the rub here we're gonna
end up rolling an inefficient squad in
order to make sure that our puppy uh
stays pogged up because it needs to
scale so we we probably lowered our
chances of winning this round quite
frankly i'm not that impressed with the
stats but i think we have an easy avenue
to improve in the future
am i crazy this seems like we win these
i don't know how it happened i guess the
enemy had a duck that's how it happened
easy enough
um
so we think
we really have seven now we have eight
gold to work with
now we have seven gold to work with um
call me a little crazy here
i think for a minute nah we could
probably do better hold on
hold on i got something stuck in my
teeth too
you get old the enamel starts to wear
gums start to recede a little bit
this is not for comedic timing
it's genuinely wedged in there
okay i think we're good
the question becomes
how much do you want to value
the effects of food on your insects
versus just having a good unit like
there's something for me
about like what if you turn this into a
into a four seven rat
but i don't really want to invest in
your scaling
on the other hand
no we can't we won't have enough gold
for it you can really only buy two
things with one reroll here
so i would say you can do this
and we'll just put it there for now and
then we'll roll one time because neither
of these inspire me and then with our
limited amount of resources
i'm actually just gonna invest in
buffing the puppy it doesn't buff
anything except the puffy or the puppy
and the ladybug but so be it
we freeze the apple because we might
want to buff
green beetle to make our shop better in
the future but it remains to be seen
don't hit my front liner okay i can live
with that
if you hit the back liner it life goes
on okay you get owned you get owned i'm
i'm not
i'm i'm pessimistic no never mind i'm
optimistic we're great we win it's our
second win two wins okay we're puzzling
out a little slower here which i think
is good you could totally
take a hatching chick
we know there's going to be a combine do
we need to make our hatching chick
stronger by feeding
the beetle
not at all
but i still like to keep one apple
around i know it's not um and again
we're saying temporarily we're saying no
to bats
i don't even know when i decided on this
i just think
i i'm at this point it's just
stubbornness and you know what i'm gonna
say that that's okay
we're learning archetypes without bats
and then maybe you could shove a bat in
there at some point so we got a 13-13 we
really need garlic on the puppy and then
we'll start to freaking cruise for a
little bit um
this squad is scarier than it looks like
obviously we had the best unit um
we don't quite win these though we we
lose these by one
it's painful that takes us to two wins
two losses two wins two losses
it hurts pain pain they say um
i will buy you
i'll fully admit
a little over invested in the concept of
food meta here
we still kind of got to keep you here
for scaling unless we no we look i think
we might lose this one
but i think this gives us a a really
good way
to
win like the next three or four and we
might not lose this one we got a pretty
okay i mean that's
unfortunate in some ways unfortunate in
others i think we're gonna be fine
i think just to be honest even if it is
a little rude i think our opponent's
squad was just straight dookie that's
not always the sign of a bad player
sometimes is just a sign of a bad shop
so three tier ones it's in two tier
threes it's not great poodle but
poodle's worth reconfiguring in some
circumstances um i think we're probably
actually ready to dump both insects
though which actually might mean that
the poodle sort of fits but just give it
a moment okay so freeze me just so i
don't forget
i understand that you know that giving
you some food might be advantageous if
we're gonna buy two of the units that
are in the present shop but
i'm kind of i find it slightly
disagreeable so i like this
it's very nice
i guess we'll roll once
i'm gonna buy a poodle what are you
three four
you're a three
you're a three it's very difficult to
buff the
the puppy instead of the hatching chick
if we want the puppy to get the benefit
so the hatching chick is probably not
long for this world for now though them
i mean actually you know what the rabbit
gets the buff right now which is not
ideal
but it's okay
i can actually live with this squad we
keep two gold for the scaling we got an
18 19 garlic armor puppy
we're in flux right now okay and it
needs to there's some work that needs to
be done
look i'm not trying to be a hater i'm
just gonna be straight up with you if
you buy a squirrel you're doing it wrong
i have tried to make it work i've been
very into food meta
it's so rarely actually the right way to
do it because the food you need one more
buff out of it you need like food
becomes uh cheaper or something like
that in order for it to have any chance
of getting there
we can buy one more thing this is
totally fine you would just buy a salad
you hope that it hits some good units
you keep your scaling going here
obviously the poodle buffs are not
exactly going where i want them
but really this squad is just a puppy
so what do we want at the end i don't
know i guess like 30 scorpions or
something like that if we can get like
30 scorpions going
i'm stunned i'm stunned we made it out
of that they were equipmented up to the
gills
um
and yet here we are
stay winning we don't need a turtle yet
it's a little early
and i'll tell you straight up i i don't
buy the permanent hatching chick
i like getting the plus two plus two
permanently although
i will admit if there were any situation
in which it worked
it might be this one um
but i i kind of want to keep it uh
it pays for itself pretty early i guess
you know we gotta at this point
and we'll keep you here for scaling
we'll buy that next time to get our fish
going we'll definitely at this point
probably sell our poodle
even though it's self buffing um we'll
sell the poodle to fit a cow keep the
bunny or unless we lose if we lose
we might sell the bunny to try to wait
you'll see anyway you'll see this seems
okay i'm a little scared 19 garlic armor
is is quite nasty to get around but
that's very lucky we win these that's
kind of incredible
i wish i could say nicer things about
the peacock even when we use it
ourselves i tend to be disappointed so
you take this and what do we think about
a pair
we gotta run the math we'll go to eight
gold okay so if we buy this we go to
four
sell we go to five that's actually fine
am i am i okay selling the poodle
nah man nah you gotta ten nine poodle
versus ten thirteen fish if we're not
gonna keep like a bison you sell the
fish so that you get the long-term
stats you buy the pair
very nice
get a little cow action out here
i was way off on gold by the way
buff your
puppy maybe it wasn't actually this
takes us to five
then we can buy one more thing might as
well buy
i don't know straight up i'll tell you
i'm gonna buy a mammoth
um because if we get a pill that's a
plus two plus two on everybody win or
lose um and the only other thing i just
think is like we drop a tropical fish in
there somewhere but like who really
cares it's actually working out pretty
well it purges melon armor uh on a unit
that would have otherwise lost it to our
puppy
puppy would have been in a much worse
spot turns out i'm an accidental genius
that's why sometimes having a a bit of a
dummy unit in position one can work to
your advantage
i'm willing to sell you for the record
the only thing is we we kind of need
like one other unit that does anything
what do you what do you think
we're on seven wins what do you think
honestly if you're being honest with me
if you're honest with me what do you
think about
selling
everything
buying a worm
and then just sending this dude to the
freaking
s
oh that's fine sending them to the
freaking stratosphere right like you're
a 34 30 40. i like that let's get that
the hatching chick buffing you a little
bit further we can stop our scaling
really at any point on the puppy i
suppose if we wanted
this is bad
okay this we're experiencing hey watch
lion
if we talk about classics does my name
get brought up we're on seven wins
look it's probably a little late for the
worm okay
i could have told you that um why don't
you
feed me
still because at this point we might as
well give it a try
uh combine me buy me
pill me
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yup yup yup yum
yum yum yum what about one of these
we made it work last time
the worms got a long way to go don't get
me wrong but
i was gonna say we're still relatively
early but i don't think that's the case
at all okay this is a nightmare squad
oh that's so bad
if we just had a little bit more hp we
probably swing that but i like that
that's a cool squad man no disrespect
there's seven wins i'm not feeling bad
about it
i'm feeling really bad about this
okay i'm not feeling so bad
thank you thank you
sulking posers that's kind of
it's kind of
fitting it's kind of apt no mosquitoes
please mosquito
is not unexpected
wow
a little surprised
still
lucky me i suppose um
i think three ants
is
possible
but i think it's a recipe for despair
i'm gonna keep it around man
we probably should do two one in front
of three two
but life goes on
okay that's what we want to see pass it
backwards okay that's that's fine we
draw these
we draw these that's okay i think with
positioning we could have won that but
you know
what the heck
okay hold on yeah yeah
probably welcome um
come on you got i mean you have to
you gotta
and then there's a part of me no you
don't pill it come on man there's a part
of me that's like you know what
this is gonna be uh very interesting
you definitely do not pillow i don't
know if this squad wins for the record
but the concept of a two squad marty
early is too hilarious for me to not
give it at least a little try
i think we definitely lose
but it's kind of funny you gotta admit
now
we literally just roll this
and there's there's a bit of like
praying involved here um because we need
to last long enough for our caterpillars
to pop
okay don't cry
kind of nice i guess kind of why i
forgot about the fact that we're gonna
buff the heck out of a unit here at some
point our beaver is what 4-4 our beaver
can probably go
we got to think about how we're going to
how we're going to get this to pop
something needs stats
that's unfortunate but winning is always
nice
okay um the the truth of the matter is
it's actually really sick to get a level
two turtle because we might and i stress
the might here
we might live long enough
i'm gonna i'm breaking all the rules and
you're gonna laugh at this
i'm giving this caterpillar garlic armor
because it actually might be like our
best unit for a little bit here and i
cannot lose uh and by which i mean we
cannot afford to lose
okay we like it
like it love it
love it gotta have it oh man okay um now
we're gonna get two level ups here
should be interesting
unfortunately you don't really do
anything for us but that's okay i think
we can definitely sell a bat to fit some
other stuff in but i but what but
what i don't know
please please i don't know what's
getting buffed at this point man
it's driving me crazy
i mean i think you can fit it
i can't bring myself to kill him he's
going to be such an important part of
the squad if we can keep
if we can keep the the game
pumping
i don't know man the the we i the
problem is obvious okay
i don't know what the heck the
caterpillars are gonna steal the stats
from
but i guess that's something that we'll
just maybe we'll just buy a bunch of
cans i don't know
this is a very cool team
we're lucky to draw and i know that
look i got to go back on my my earlier
assessment okay a draw is a win of your
scaling except for the fact that the
game gets much harder over time so if
anything is more like a
i would say a draw is like a draw who
would have thought now oh you don't need
to tell me because you just hold on
freeze me
i want to keep you around well i will
well i will
i'd honestly like to
get like a hatching chick or
something oh come on man you can you
know what you can do
this is a it's a mess
but it's kind of hilarious
so you're going to become a butterfly
next time which is going to lower your
stats
but that's what the heck is this
what is this
hippo and we don't kill it in one hit oh
no this is like this is a nightmare
we actually almost made it but i mean in
theory this is where things could start
to pop
okay so we got one of you
you need a level
this is totally fine although i hate
that you're pulling stats from something
that sucks
but we i guess to be honest with you i
think we gotta kill our ants
i hate it we got a can
buy one of these
maybe the caterpillar could steal
the effect of the caterpillar
this is going nowhere man
i'm i'm i've gone too big for my
britches is the problem here
i know we're losing the garlic here but
oh we lose the garlic on transform
anyway
okay
i don't know
i don't know what's going on okay
we we at least kill their hippo uh no
you know what i've completely gone in
reverse now i'm like so you're saying
there's a chance
of course yeah what was i thinking how
could i be so naive is to think that
this squad couldn't get the job done
look at this look at this
all of a sudden we're popping
we gotta freeze you we gotta freeze you
we gotta absolutely buy you i don't
really care for you
we gotta freeze you
level two cow incoming
just let it ride man let it right well
you're in 2019 so we got three 2019's
on turn nine hold on hold on they well
so great minds think alike great minds
think alike they say
i see that you have gone with this ant
strategy as well i'm a little scared and
may i even say perturbed by what you got
going on with this rooster but we're
making it through
feeling pretty good
who would have thought two caterpillars
okay
feeling okay feeling feeling groovy
you gotta go
thank you for your help by the way i
know i said it so outrageously you gotta
go but whatever okay so if we're gonna
buy something
honestly like
forget the can let's talk about this
turtle
you need to eat this
might as well sell you recapture some
gold you need to eat this
now we're gonna have three
32 31s
that's the kind of scaling like just to
be straight up you can kind of you can
kind of hang your hat on that
okay we're going to roll we're going to
roll further
it's hilarious we can't
and i know you're like that's when he
says he can't but then he does no no no
not this time
um we're we're locked in pretty tight
here we're gonna have to win five if we
want to get to 10 we're gonna have to
win five pretty hot games
against some serious foes like this is
not that bad
but uh that that worm at the front a
little spicy for sure i can't believe
like i mean it just goes to show you how
good um
the bison can be especially if you can
get it to level two like we didn't get
it until pretty late
versus our caterpillars at least and it
it popped man it popped
okay um
turns out we probably probably could
have run a caterpillar just for the
record
i think that you can sell a cow
i think for now you buy a scorpion and
buy one of these next turn we probably
do create a level three turtle
uh and the scorpion is is uh
very
expendable you can get rid of it and
then buy it back later at very limited
you know cost effectively um
caterpillars are popping man 338 37's
two of them are going to have melon
armor
we get owns oh and then i believe we're
owning and the owning continues and then
it's going to be a 38-34 against a 1-1 b
we're going to win that one for
sure this is exciting too
um
and i i love you but i gotta see you see
you later for a second uh this is
exciting too because it's like one of
the
um
things that i'm interested in seeing
you can totally run a microbe here
there's no reason you couldn't
[Laughter]
it's one of the
you're honestly like you're tapped we
don't need you anymore one up on anybody
not really not really
um
i guess a one-up you don't even need a
one-up on the micro it's totally fine um
this is not even like a bm micro build
this is like just a really natural way
for it to fit into the ecosystem man um
but it having more hp which i believe is
coming in the in the update
actually opens up like many more scaling
builds like this that you know i
wouldn't find myself thinking like do i
have the space to make it work i would
be like let's let's go let's go
so what do you buy here to improve your
run well you're gonna be maxed basically
i guess we just try to
scaled the heck out of our turtle
doesn't really make any sense at all i
mean i guess you could put
a chili pepper on the microbe to purge
melon armor and then
sure okay yeah why not
it is a bit of a strange build
chili pepper oh it purges i'm melon look
at that
okay yeah i'm a little worried about
this uh what this snake can accomplish
by
dumping his melon yeah
yeah
you see you see what i see we're gonna
win this one easily dude i mean now i
feel bad for complaining that like this
run couldn't get there because it's
doing so well um
by itself
and again there's a part of me that's
like but i mean maybe what if you just
no it's
come on come on two apples like don't
don't make me laugh
i think you could
there's no reason to put a chili pepper
on you doesn't make any sense
we could put a cupcake on you no we'll
just put a cupcake on you
and that after all that sure let's uh
let's put an apple on you
three fifty fifties that'll have melon
armor versus a squad of
presumably weaklings what the heck is
tiger deer
two buses on honestly could do some
damage to our melon armors
but overall
i feel pretty
pretty okay two five five buses yeah
this i mean again i allow me to
apologize for ever doubting this um it
actually was not even close
for our final attempts here like this
was
pretty much automatic
i hope you enjoyed the videos uh the
video here if you did click the like
button i'll send a great deal of course
subscribe if you want to see more in the
future for now thanks for watching i'll
see you next time see ya



it's like two clicks to run the casino
man because like
i can just pop this out here and i can
just say
will annel get six wins or more i can
start that prediction i can move it over
and then like what are we on we're on
free to play okay let's give it a try i
got a special guest with me here today
um let's start the arena up
you see me play this on my phone on
occasion honey you should you should be
better than at least half of chad
so this is a great start you get an
otter you combine it with a fish you
roll once we were looking for another
otter didn't get one you put an ant in
front of the fish
you didn't run the casino yet sorry
sorry true true that's true that's true
um
i'll be the skilled uh tugboat right
here actually foamy tugboats kind of a
sick name
two one three four one two we win these
unless our ant gets sniped
nice try you peace
let's go that's a dream we win these
there's one win
the foamy tug boats okay what do we got
here i gotta be honest honey this is a
garbage shop
pretty garbage shop we can put a second
fish in here we can put a beaver in here
with three extra gold we could put a
little buff on our fish
this is not as strong as our first uh
run but it's pretty or is our first wave
but it's pretty good two four fours kind
of nasty though kind of nasty with it
doesn't matter we win these for sure
that's two out
no problem don't touch the microphone
don't don't touch the microphone
don't touch the microphone
don't touch the microphone
don't do it
you you got me like uh i'm spending so
much time managing you that i'm like i'm
taking as long as mouth takes on his
versus turns hello hooray
hooray
hooray
hip hip
hooray
so good all right um i don't want a
second ant
that hurts me
that hurts it hurts when they do this
this hurts me i mean this is this is bad
this is bad but i'm going for it
we just spent three gold on rolling
which is very painful
honestly though the shop is like kind of
it's kind of doo-doo
so i i respect this i'm gonna
i'm gonna sell the beaver to get some
stats it did not hit both fish which is
great news i'm gonna buy a dodo
i'm gonna kill our ants
the ant has buffed the dodo which is a
dream come true hey
opium and blood don't listen honey but
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
i mean i think you could roll an
elephant at the
i think you could roll an elephant at
the back if you have to
if you have to
sorry we fainted the ant we didn't kill
you we just fainted it that nice little
ante just got fainted
no problem
we love to see this great ant luck for
us
we win these for sure this is a this is
an easy win
i'm not reading your name but thank you
for the gifted subscriptions thank you
hooray
we gotta win hooray
she's like little hooray little hooray
okay don't grab that mic though you
don't need to grab the mic
okay we're looking for like a a combo
piece
yeah
we're looking for a combo piece we do
not have one yet i will not invest in my
elephant
i will roll that's exactly what we're
trying to see right there
level two fish creates a camel
you gotta think about this one
camel is is viable hey o-n thank you for
the gifted subscriptions as well i
promise i'm not just farming them
i appreciate it
um i honestly think i think the elephant
camel combo is kind of terrible
i don't think it's very good i think you
just invest in stronger units instead
but i don't mind keeping you around for
a second here maybe giving you some
garlic i think i think you can function
for a little bit
i'm gonna be straight up best chance of
winning
imo looks something like this
this squad is a little busted though
it's like not in a good way but we're
winning early which is very nice dash of
bidders thank you thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
we get two nice trades here
i mean i feel like we definitely win
these
this takes us to four
okay now we're talking now this is a
squad now we can fight
i think you roll a rabbit
you attach garlic to your camel
you sell an elephant
to purchase a second rabbit you freeze
two items of decent food roll once on
your shop freeze you just in case i
don't care for getting a next level fish
i think the fish is pretty much topped
out on scaling purposes right now
this looks pretty solid it's a great
time for a white weeny build
juice
juice me
squeeze me
i think we lose
yeah we lose this that's okay honestly
it was the meat on that ants did some
serious work that's a horse
first defeat what are we on five wins
four wins four wins
okay i think we start here
she i swear to god she said you peace
did you say you peace
what are you what are you saying what
are you saying
i don't know if we buy this yet okay i'm
just thinking
juice
[Laughter]
you want to see something crazy
double bye sell me
buy me
nice buff sell me
buy me
unbelievable buff
814 camel
with garlic armor up at the front
this looks fantastic
hi
you're feeling better now
dude rabbit meta is so strong like this
is actually crazy talk
ah
okay we're one win away from believers
getting paid out
i need you to analyze the game of sap
that dan just played you're gonna lose
your mind
dan i have to i have to hand it to him
okay so there i did not respect food
meta
dan is absolutely right
whether he knew it or not food meta is
actually like kind of cracked
toss me a rooster just
because we we needed some space right
now
we're gonna this is a believer payout
right here yo this is a viewer too
anybody else viewing right now or just
me
and this fish is gonna go wild man
that takes us to six
omg me
and now we can start our like real pivot
here
like there's no there's not much reason
for this fish to exist long term the
rooster on the other hand can kind of
stick around
so there's a part of me that's like for
now
we can roll this
sell a fish but keep the camel
don't don't don't do me like this
sell a fish
no
oh it worked
sell the fish
keep the camel
run it like this
a little monkey monkey buffs the rooster
when the rooster hits level two we gotta
move it but it ain't level two yet
hello hooray
hooray
what are you looking at
what do you see
where's the monkey
where's the monkey
i you're not wrong camel kangaroos kind
of cracked but i i put a lot of respect
on the rabbit's name
i mean i think garlic might win us
around here i'll take my one hp as well
salads salads no joke man salad is no
joke
she's reading chat don't read chat
please don't read chat
you're not supposed to read i don't
honestly you shouldn't be reading chat
until you're like 50 years old
excuse me excuse me
hi baby
are you seeing this where dude honestly
slowing myself down has actually helped
out like a great deal
we're now at seven wins on round
we're seven and one because this is
gonna be round nine you know we're
buying
you know we're buying you know we're
rolling
hmm
for now i'm gonna take a a second level
dodo
but the rooster is is also insanely
topped here with more chocolate for sure
honey oh she's
she's starting to get a little unhappy
we're going up against another food
scaling build which means we win these
hi
oh she she she's rebelling
honey we're almost at 10 wins look at
this
we're almost at 10 wins we're so good
you can double up sushi here man this is
no problem
bliss
what do we got what do we got you know
what run me run me with a little triple
sushi
she's spinning she's turning my
headphone cord into spaghetti
i'm now this is my new posture sushi me
sushi me
end turn
14 18 level one rooster
honey you're all you're all tangled up
um
it's a little spooky
but garlic like absolutely crushes flies
so level two turkey's pretty nasty but
i don't know this one i would say is up
in the air for the time being
maybe it's not up in the air maybe we're
definitely going to lose
this this is like the meta build
which is fine i don't you know sometimes
you got no choice but to run the meta
build we just want to see oh the dog's
definitely going to kill us
we were not by that much actually
what do you see a fly
you see
she knows some of these animals where's
the cow
you see a cow
where's the cow
okay so i'm gonna sell for now we can
sell this monkey we can do better we can
run a scorpion instead for the time
being
we're gonna buff the rooster to see if
they can live through multiple attacks i
really appreciate the extra hp here
we're gonna freeze the scorpion
murr
we're going to sell a cow
we're going to roll a snail
snail doesn't make a moo sound but
nobody knows what sound the snail makes
so i wouldn't sweat it too much
if you want to say moo go ahead and say
moo i think that's that's totally fine
we're gonna
moo to you as well
honestly believe it or not i actually
think we roll scorpion position three to
kill their big unit
then when we kill their big unit
the camel will live longer and make our
rabbit unkillable
okay i'm very happy we did not have our
scorpion at the front by the way
scorpion at the front would have been
would have been a real problem here
dad
yo we win these i'm not saying i'm a
genius
cheese
i mean we're about to get a 10-win baby
percent which is kind of crazy
there's no doubt we're gonna be putting
chocolate onto our rooster here
and then we'll be placing our rooster
um hey moo thanks gifted subscriptions
thank you
sell our rabbit
um this is i mean i guess i'm gonna roll
dodo camel
scorpion at the front tiger so we're
gonna create four 2120 ones the great
thing about this squad is that if it
sucks we'll just reconfigure it like we
can easily move things around here and
not um
not have it be like a big problem
like this squad is very modular
no snipes no snipes what the heck is
this
what the heck is this a
tiger gorilla
that tiger gorilla you have to give it
your respect
the respect door has logged uh never
mind it's actually horrible
i do not respect it any longer it's pure
garbage
oh man um it it just got swept off the
map there's 10 wins look at that
honestly we did not have like a cracked
early to mid game
so i'm feeling like that was pretty
solid give me a complete prediction on
that one and then start me back up will
we get the six wins or more we'll stay
on free to play for the time being
60 extra points
play arena please
very interesting
the question is do we think we're gonna
get a better role with one role do we
think we're gonna do better than cricket
oh baby
baby baby
baby baby
yes it's certainly possible
i think we i think we freeze
freeze
roll
that's the worst unit in the game
um let's do it
don't touch the mic connie
so we got a 3-4 that only gives us value
on cell
i mean broken bones
precious pieces though i mean
precious pieces is kind of it's
alliteration it has peace in it
broken bones is a little bit more like
you know
it's sensible but
i definitely by the way we lose these
it wasn't even
close i mean i don't see how you can't
put a duck here
hello
and we gotta pretty much do it like that
okay um
you will be ashamed of your words and
your deeds when you encounter the uber
duck
make the best seven wins
like people like don't take us the wrong
way even though it's kind of insulting
people have short memories man like
people were saying that yesterday then
we had like four doubter wins in a row
just because the bets aren't 50 50 you
know i'm not running the the sports book
at the cosmopolitan
okay you know what we can
sheesh
we could totally fit a dog we got a lot
of space for a dog
you can level a duck to seven eight
hello
we did this wrong we should have
summoned it first but um
you
dunk duck
i don't mind adding the blowfish
myrrh
it it does not go moo but she doesn't
need to know that right now okay seven
eight duck is kind of cruising right now
it's kind of cruising we win these nice
try
i mean you got to get rid of something
right now i'll get rid of this fish
because it's basically useless you buy a
pig it costs you one gold to buff your
dog for one
it's very good
scampi can't fit we already got our meme
you can roll a spider for a second buff
the dog
if you get a pill you're not upset about
it okay sell me take me to six
honk honk
buy me a pig sell me a pig
takes us to five
hong kong buy me a horse sell me a horse
buy me a hedgehog
six four
yeah maybe if she's five foot two
so cute
whoa yo we win these by the way she's
trying why is she trying to
roll off of me here
yep i can't believe we're in three wins
one loss like it's actually kind of
it's kind of staggering
um
okay you know you need this dog
this is such a good one-handed game man
like i can't believe it like if i was
trying to play isaac the stream would be
grounded down
to a freaking uh
to a a halt
because i am not playing isaac
look at the power here
look at the power we can we can be one
of the top tier gamers of this
while also taking care of my baby at the
same time this is a nightmare super
billy 115 is is
about to win uh 10 wins without even
breaking a sweat
that's an incredible game
or an incredible play
i you
hello honey
no no no no we will kill you
i'm a simple man i like rolling i don't
see a dog
honey honey honey
we might be kind of forced
to roll i've never seen melon armor on a
duck before
um
we might be forced to throw a duck in
here
combine it
i'm gonna i'm a simple man
ani you can't roll away okay if you
would just sit here calmly and quietly
for five hours it wouldn't be a problem
but unfortunately babies are not really
like that
okay here here can i 180 u
can i 180 here i am
doing everything i can
holding on to what i am
i think we're gonna get strange i think
we're gonna sell
i did not mean to do that
we can still do it we can still do it
it's the same order
we put you here we put a crab behind the
dog
we roll one time
and we buy another no no not the mic not
the mic
anything but the mic you can you can tug
on daddy's face like on the mario 64
start screen
you just can't
touch the buttons on the microphone
it's another scary team yes that's
pretty nasty that's pretty nasty
and hold on our kangaroo is a little
cracked though
we win these it's kind of incredible
what do you see a dog
woof woof
woof
woof
woof
okay
blowfish is gone
duck is here
honestly toss me a swan
where you're going where you're going
anything but the mic anything but the
mike
i'm a simple man
freeze me roll me
unfreeze me freeze me
roll me
server works again
you okay honey
you can check this out sell me
buy me
sell me
freeze me roll me it's incredible is
unbelievable
the rise of the uber duck
we still want i don't know we could
probably dump that
11 13 level two almost level three duck
the time has come
still kind of bad
hello
here you go
she was just about getting fed up with
daddy
okay the crab does nothing without meat
say bye bye baby
bye bye
okay
we dump a crab
we buy a snail
we probably dump a snail but we give it
a second
we don't need well i don't know maybe we
will see if we get one more snail
uh we should have sold them for more
money now that i think about it but just
roll me instead because if we got one
more it would be legendary
okay fair enough uh sell me i mean this
is like the easiest buy of my life
and you know in the future we're going
to be popping another one down right
here to make the uber duck
please 1919 melon armor duck
oh no my monkey
is what i would be saying if my monkey
mattered at all
okay we win these
50 50 duck incoming
that's five wins it can happen man it
can happen
with the duck
tonight
oh this is a gimme it's one of these
it's one of these
i need to roll both i need to roll both
of these things
for the time we freeze a snake
and we roll tiger behind kangaroo for
one round for one round
next round when our gold situation gets
sorted
they have no fly yet there's a chance
next round when the gold situation gets
sorted we're freaking cruising man we're
freaking cruising
plus three plus three no sweat man this
kangaroos is freaking poppin
it's poppin
your owns you're easily owns your easily
owned nice turkey wow turkey's not even
in the he put turkey in the eighth here
are you kidding me what's wrong with you
put the turkey and the turkey is the
best the best in the game there's the
best you know in the game the turkey can
you believe that he would disrespect a
turkey like that your turkey
just lost to a duck okay nice duck
you fool you're fool you got fooled okay
it happens don't cry about it get sold
don't this is a dream shop
sell me
thank you thank you for not desyncing me
we need some hp on this dog please
you're gonna toss me a little snake
right here no question about it
you're gonna freeze this for a moment
you need a buff you still need more hp
you're always gonna need more hp
freeze me again come on we can make it
one more round we can make it one more
round
with the super duck build
oh my god the snake just saved my life
[Laughter]
holy crap what is that seven wins with
the quack squad
i wish that we could keep scaling the
dog but honestly the dog could be
replaced with a scorpion right now
it could be replaced with another monkey
for sure
i can't believe we got a 3636 duck man
what a world
oh my god it's still cracked
oh
there's eight wins wait that's that's
eight wins yeah yeah yeah that's eight
wins true true true this is true okay
you stay frozen for a minute honestly
dog like it's been nice to have you but
we're replacing you in an incredibly
disrespectful way we want to see uh
snakes snakes are a big part of this
squad
we can see if we can't see snakes that's
fine
we'll just invest in some like some
little buffs
that's a good freeze that's a good
freeze
this seems uh very good for our snake
although the snake will die to the
the whale when it comes out but we're
gonna do so much damage in the interim
period like it doesn't matter
it actually just doesn't matter
yeah okay
get owned
so that's nine
i can't believe that this is actually
happening right here
get ready to take your screenshots
don't desync me
please
roll me
roll me
don't don't
ludwig just let me play for a second man
just let me play for a second
don't go live yet let me play it just
for a second man just for just for a
freaking second
just for a freaking second
okay five five scorpions coming out here
oh it's the dream
holy birsh
were you ashamed of your words and your
deeds
we just got 10 wins
with like a what was it a 46 46 duck
just goes to show you
go ahead challenge me honestly the the
best part about it is that the duck
actually didn't matter at all only the
stats mattered
the duck's effect never was realized



it literally could have been like a 50
50 sloth
it's just
the best unit is whatever you get the
most of early um give me a slash marker
that'll be sap one you know the deal
we're gonna roll it back with the with
the pay to win we're still trying to
figure out pay to win man we got a long
way to go on pay to win
two verses i would consider doing versus
if it didn't time out every single round
because like one person takes 300
seconds to come up with their turn
this is insane man
i don't even know if it's that good but
it's definitely insane
be the running running teapots that
sounds nice
like i think this squad can lose
early never mind we're gonna win this i
apologize for
sandbagging a little bit
you can definitely play this
probably should have had you eat an
apple instead
freeze me
definitely should have had you eat an
apple instead but it happens
although two two ants probably wouldn't
have mattered it probably wouldn't have
mattered
wouldn't have mattered okay good good to
know unless maybe the ant buffs went in
a different direction maybe who knows
well nice buffs unfortunately i have
better luck that takes us to two wins
well we're definitely gonna kill one of
you but like let's start here and then
here
that's insanity
kill me
i'm honestly like part of me is like
freeze me roll me look for another pill
we needed it to show up there that's
fine it doesn't always it doesn't always
work i'm gonna get you to
eat i know how this looks it looks a
little spicy that's cause it is a little
spicy we're gonna throw a caterpillar
out here
we're gonna freeze some meat
and we're gonna roll a three squad marty
this squad can win
don't shoot my aunt saved
this squad can also lose and it seems
like that's definitely what's gonna
happen not by much though i think it's
worth it for the scaling in the future
which is basically that this caterpillar
is gonna level up on exactly the right
turn to propel us
i'm not gonna give you some meats let's
let's wait on that we can definitely add
a bat to the equation if we're going to
add a bat to the equation we might as
well feed you a little bit first that
way we get a 1-4 bat
dude super auto humans could be kind of
sick that could be fun true that's true
this looks totally fine
i'm devastated
[Laughter]
i can't belie i i mean i guess i can
believe it i'm just like really
okay take a little uh we shouldn't we
should have rolled once
it doesn't really matter what's leaving
here this ant is just begging for a pill
i think you you pretty much add a puppy
so you're you're gone you're gone you're
toast puppy will be a great scaler that
will work with your caterpillar in the
long term
if you buy
sell this is good buy
sell me
i'll live with that buy a puppy we're at
the perfect level here freeze the snail
for the future
puppy gets buffed
we need to draw until or or you know it
would be nice if we won but we need to
draw or do better for a little bit here
and l what are your thoughts on island
boy
i'm i'm very familiar with the song
we're gonna lose this one for sure
um
something something island boy something
something island boy
it's from it's from those tick tock
twins right and not the uh
not the voros twins
keep me as keep me a swan just for a
moment
although i gotta be honest with you like
we can replace that bat very easily
level up one turn earlier
sell me
there's no real point to a buy me sell
me
something like this will go a long way
then get great rolls very good roll
very good roll
okay this round
not losing would be incredible
i have no idea what you're talking about
you don't know it's under the island boy
or something something island boy
you don't know that one it's kind of
sick man
it's honestly like the song of the
summer
okay swan you can now leave the premises
we would like to add a turtle
into our system
we don't know we could use that
you don't say okay um for now
i would honestly say
i think garlic on our dog does better
than a turtle but we freeze the turtle
for the next round for sure
what about a bison
i'll just be honest
i'll just be honest with you i basically
just criminally underrate the uh the
bison
well
that's just a great shot man you can't
be upset
anytime i see a bison like it doesn't
even enter into my world view which is
not smart obviously
can me i'm still a big believer in this
run
uh-oh they know what they're doing i see
a dolphin you son of a
what is this
you see what you've done crabs you see
what you've done
there was so many crabs
that everybody started rolling dolphins
to kill the crabs and now caterpillars
don't even work anymore thanks a lot i
really appreciate it
okay we'll pay out the doubters
the the caterpillar is just oh and we're
rolling it back by the way the
caterpillar is just like collateral
damage man like the i'm like you can't
play them anymore you just can't play
them anymore
freeze me
oh that's a that's a freaking gimme stay
frozen
um
be the unwashed nuts
this is not the way this squad should be
outlined as well
you place the bison and aids here no
like i legitimately like i just don't um
like when i see it in my brain i just
completely discount it i need to pay
attention to when the bison shows up
we're lucky we drew there honestly
honestly
i think this is
frees me
this is a tight the timing is tight i'm
going to guess that we're going to go up
against ants so i'm going to buy you
i'm going to buy you
i'm going to roll once
this is what i wanted to see so now i'm
not going to take them i'm not going to
take the mosquito i'm going to take
another 1-3 i'm going to freeze this one
through i'm going to freeze an apple
and we got 3 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 1 3. this is
a strong squad 4 is overpowered amounts
of hp early on
they have less units and yet all of
their units don't even have four hp so
i'm not sweating it in the slightest we
win these
242 for him me him me him him me
okay this is beautiful
i can't not okay like
i can't not
um
it's when you get it this early you
gotta give it a try man you gotta give
it a try
we just gotta snipe your dolphin before
your dolphin snipes us or something i
don't know if that even makes any sense
if that even works or whatever
um
four
five no it's not good enough
buy me
roll me
stay frozen and just give me one of
those and then freeze me
we'll use you for a round we'll get
we'll get the scaling factor off of it
later
is there anti-dolphin tech
unfortunately not
i think the anti-dolphin tech is built
into its own stats like its stats are
very unimpressive
oh daniel
thanks for the raid you were playing
super auto pets right
how'd you like it
whoa
how did you like it how did you like it
whoa
he hated it
you know what i gotta say about that
just look at my team name
why wash these windows when you can wax
these drawers
bro
i'm just gonna be straight up with you i
think you just do that
yeah i know i got a frozen apple if you
got an issue here's a tissue
les turnell thank you for the gifted
subscriptions by the way thank you thank
you no bat hey if the bad could kill a
dolphin before the dolphin killed my
butterfly i would be into it but it
can't what is this squad
drown yourself in the waters wait no
dunk yourself in the waters of lake
minnetonka don't drown yourself
i forgot about the
i forgot about the quote okay hold on
you can definitely bison bison bison
bison
and check this out
we combine
we feed
honestly with a caterpillar
i think you buy an owl sell it hit
something that's not a fish which this
fish should not be here i'm just gonna
level with you
add a bison to the squat it won't pop
for a minute but that's okay it's
already a six seven we're rolling an ant
just for temporary purposes
double double garlic wait that's not
double garlic that's just garlic hold on
we win these
dude this squad should not be perfect
yet but alas it is
juicy
it's about time for my arrival now
you're buffing already man you're
already buffing
you're like mudge ellen you're so
jealous i'll level with you dude i'll
level with you okay i think literally
for one round you can
it worked
i think you can roll a bluebird
for one round
because i think our squad is good enough
to win regardless
it's not the best thing to buy to win
this round but i think it's the best
thing to buy to keep our scaling going
in the future
who would have thought we'd just crack
your melon armor like a son of a gun
this looks like a a draw to me
take it
we want to see more bisons please we
want to see more island boys as well
you could definitely fit a scorpion into
this ecosystem man
um
i'm just going to be honest we're going
to continue feeding the bison because
that's the scaling engine for our
caterpillar long term
um
if we see something better we might take
it
i don't see anything better man although
garlic in the future for our bison
pretty solid
the unwashed nuts huh
many people are saying that i have the
strongest team names in the game
we dude stats are stats are op look at
this
five wins no losses
a cow
do have a cow man
i'll just own up to this
seven eight green beetle
is going bye-bye
dorothy put on your red slippers because
kansas is going bye-bye
it's beautiful we'll probably sell you
but just give it a sec we don't have to
do it right this is a dream man it's a
dream
you sell the cow
you buff the bison even further you put
a turtle in front of the caterpillar
this is lovely
this is like a lovely squad
if if i
honestly any team that i run into that
has five scorpions more power to you i
love multiple scorpions i love putting
them in weird places like not in
position one i have nothing but respect
for that meta
i gotta say i've i've said some things i
regret but i got nothing but respect for
dolphin meta as well
um it's it's fun it's a lot of fun
and and you take a big risk rolling it
so
no disrespect
the unwashed nuts versus the desperate
mouths
okay we've only got four more rounds
till we tap out so do we well four more
wins till we tap out i don't think we
need to roll another caterpillar i think
it's it's just actually too late
i think we focus on a little bit of
scaling
some scaling factors
hello
hello
hello
i would still like you i would still
like you
scale
me i almost missed the vice again i'm
like bison blind my brain does not see
the bison oh i love this man uh the
scorpion is so cracked
literally doesn't matter doesn't matter
i'm a scaling boy
you know that i'm a scaling boy
roll me
dude honestly like be mad
you could totally do this
just replace your turtle with another
turtle
nothing of value was lost
except a little experience which is not
a problem because look at that
the dude's actually lost his mind i
don't know maybe like i mean if it's
working out right now there's a part of
me that's like why change it so let's
roll this again but i am so tempted
every time by putting the scorpion like
position four
but it just gets sniped so badly by like
like a snake build or
well i mean this man blowfish
for now it ain't broke so i choose not
to fix it
this seems totally fine by the way like
this it
it seems kind of annoying but not that
bad
fly shark doesn't scare me fly turkey
doesn't scare me it just is like okay
congrats like i understand you want your
free wins enjoy them
but fly shark is like not that good
there does need to be a bonus speed
once you're going up against flies it
should unlock fly speed
because it takes it takes too long
the thing is we don't i like this is not
gonna be
a well-liked decision but that's exactly
what i wanted to see because to be
honest with you we had we got lucky but
there was no reason right away to commit
to a level two turtle
um
for a couple of different reasons one of
them is we don't need a level two turtle
to get two melon armor we could pill
this turtle in front of the bison and
then put a level one turtle out here
which is cheaper the other one is if we
got a bison on our first roll then for
nine gold we could get to a level three
and that's exactly how that went down
we got lucky we got lucky someone in
chad said put scorpion position two this
time
honestly immediately i'm like it looks
like it might have been the right play
but i think we then died of the bus
it was a good try though it was a good
try
excuse me what happened to my butterfly
i used to have a butterfly
oh well nevertheless you're so freaking
lucky you're so freaking lucky
that's fine it happens um
freaking dolphins man
freaking laser beams on their freaking
heads
i'm just insane so like i honestly
honestly what i think you do is you
start buffing your scorpion
because i'm just like
you peace
didn't even hit my freaking scorpion
because i'm just i'm like crazy like
that
i love a little big scorp meta
mostly because i'm like an island boy
okay scorp v scorp i respect this i i
think we win this one
source dude just trust me
nice try
50 50 bison you love to see it
sorry i brought up island boy he's just
been going off
excuse me what we say is this mf spittin
okay honestly i don't care to level you
quite frankly so get that chocolate out
of my face
we're buffing now
straight up you can do it
nobody tells me what i can and can't do
he's lost his mind you're the one who's
out gobby out of his mind get ready
uh oops oh no no no
uh my game
my game oh it's still go we're we're
alive again we're alive again
actually crash my game with your leopard
that's a new technique
this will still work by the way
source dude just trust me
nah man
yeah
yes
then
you go here
no dolphins please no dolphins
oh my god it worked we don't get to kill
you but at least we got to live that's
that's new man that's new
this hippo is actually
designed to kill us in a lab
look at that is that 10 win
10 win big scorpion kind of
oh well will he get the six wins or more
it turns out he will
no big deal
i'll throw out like a little slash
marker sap two there
we'll run it back start me up a
prediction will we get to six wins or
more i don't know but we're gonna run it
back
bison is is too good dude i'm gonna be
honest with you like
i love the early start and pay to win
with the beatles and the insects but
free to play there's just something
about it man there's just something
about it
you son of a okay oh you s
okay this your safety believers is not
guaranteed
this time we're not building the uber
duck
we'll be a soft baguette
the the ant probably doesn't live
through the first attack yeah this is
the most obvious loss i've ever seen in
my life
which is fine
it's fine
i'm fine
i think you freeze roll once
sell me
this is ass
this is actually ass freeze me roll me
this is actually
goaded three three two ants and a beaver
and an otter i'm dude we're starting o2
don't
dull you i was just about to talk about
how lucky we were
holy crap we draw these we draw these
that was how lucky we were that our ants
were out of mosquito range then all the
mosquitoes shot the same freaking thing
man anyway this ant is going to be
actually in a great spot
i'll be honest with you you can
absolutely
toss
a camel in front
what is this
this is very weird
and yet i find myself unperturbed that's
beautiful thank you so much that's
beautiful thank you so much you'll be
ashamed of your words and your deeds
this summer when you eat when you meet
the uber ants
sometimes you gotta come up with
decisions at run time and that's what
we're doing right here
you definitely want to fit a swan here
i mean straight up
that's not bad at all
that's not bad in the slightest
all things considered we can definitely
live with that
kind of feel like you're gonna need a
dodo
to do something at some point
like i don't know how we're gonna get
there this squad is is just
i mean it's just a
it's a bit of a mess
but if if it gets there then it gets
there man
now is it gonna get there i don't know
yet okay i don't have all the answers
sway
i do know i'm smacking there's no way we
can't kill your whale your whale is too
strong
for me traveler you kill us okay yeah
you got me you got me
this is rough this is a rough one
i'm gonna be honest the dodo the
experiment has failed
me one of those
give me one of these
sell me a turtle
i mean buy my turtle from me we're gonna
run two swans tempo rarely
we're gonna roll garlic armor on you as
well this is basically like a suicide
build to win like two rounds and then
lose when our garlic falls off but
you never know you never know
so far this is kind of like is doing
some work are you seeing this
this ant is getting insane
10 15 garlic ants
that's gonna get hit for one by like all
of these remaining units
have you heard about this kevin have you
heard about this
yeah this build is actually ancient this
is from like
the first day that the game came out
this is people always show me this too
they're like oh really horses are bad
well what if i run a horse and a dog and
i put honey on everything and i'm like
okay then you lose to one garlic armor
you spent 50 gold on something that can
be defeated for three
like i just i don't know why people are
so attached to the horse
it's just accept that it's bad and
you're fine like you just then will grow
from there
i don't understand why it's always got
to be like well the day that the game
came out i got a horse to level three
and with a b uh
my 4-1 traded with a 1-1 like a genius
like that's not a genius it makes you
look like a dang fool
nah man nah nah nah
honestly you can roll a duck here you
you and freeze a salad for the future
you can roll a duck here we want to see
no meats no meats please no meats
i see no meats
level level two horse kind of nasty with
it though no doubt about that but you
know we're we're feeding that ant man
like
this is it's kind of doing some good
stuff
we crush you that's great work man
that's great work
like just stop playing horses dude like
it's not even out of madness like are
you seeing this
oh nice b
honey badger strats honey badger works
every time just kidding
my team like the reason i'm mad i'm kind
of going off i apologize the reason i'm
mad
is because my team freaking sucks
and yet we're easily beating the horse
teams so like that's why then i gotta
hear from people like horse is actually
good true true true that's true so true
it's not man it's just not okay so just
just back up off of it okay
uh you don't know what you're talking
about give me one of those
freeze me two of these roll me
freeze me two of these
freeze me the whole damn shop roll again
okay we're not gonna freeze that though
okay this we lose this now this is a
squad
we didn't even have to deal with their
real units
okay how we getting out of this one
because we're on one life now right
two lives okay
sell me
buy me
yummy
sell me we're on you're right we're on
one life that's my mistake
yummy
yummy
yummy
no meats man
i don't see meats
i do die in two hits so don't no no i
live i live i live long enough to break
your melon armor at least
that bison's gonna be a little a little
bit of a pain though
never mind we're gonna kill the bison
we win these
this is kind of staggering but i mean ox
not bison sorry it's the same animal in
in the fossil record not that i would
expect you to understand that
okay now we're kind of popping
and there's certainly a part of me that
thinks that's sort of the way that it
must be played
this bunny is not going to last too long
for now we're gonna run a monkey because
we want it next turn
we're gonna start doing our buy sell
with the dragon following that but we
need to live for one more turn
no meats no meats
okay i'm i'm telling you i have another
thesis and my thesis is very simple is
that the elephant is so bad as to be
unplayable
i for real think the elephant is is pure
dog water
i don't think you can run it in any
circumstances
it's one of the only units in the game
that gets worse when it's leveled up
which is a bold way to approach things
okay you're gone
you're here
you're gone
we freeze you
for future purposes
bro i just need some level ones they're
literally the worst units in the game
would it kill you to give me some
pig me
i mean you roll a cow here for sure
instead of a monkey you roll a cow
roll me once
you peace
20 33 no meat no scorpion no meat no
scorpion
it's an elephant again is this the same
this must be the same team
you're like you know what it didn't work
last time but this time what if i put a
completely unbuffed hippo in the middle
instead
well it wouldn't have thought it
possible but
thank you uh thank you the believers
have won
many people are saying this
you're you're going to be a cell me
we just got to think about the way that
this looks from this just give me a
level one unit holy crap i'm upset okay
you're gonna laugh at me the time has
come for the ant to leave the ecosystem
freeze me
roll me
freeze me
this is now necessary again
in order for us to get the 10 wins this
is what has to be done
sometimes you you got to do
you got to do trades in the middle
what did you kill it was just a it was
just a monkey right
okay this we're gonna lose
[Laughter]
yeah yeah all right well you know what
the ant probably could have done it
but hey believers get paid out
regardless
run it back that was like considering
how scuffed it started
people are like he threw he didn't
really throw i mean we were like
three losses after four rounds because
we had a nightmare shop
and we still ended up paying out the
believers for the 100 percentile tonight
running it back again now this is just
the nightmare shop
better closer warmer fifty percent
maybe the comedic pieces
this is a uh a fifty percent win round
one we wanna we need to shoot an ant
please shoot an ant
i love this game
we draw these
we draw these
what did i say 50 win also known as 100
draw by me doesn't matter what you buff
ant would have been worse
straight up man i'm like chilly she's
like eh
i honestly honestly in my heart of okay
i think you play it like that it though
it pains me i think you play it like
that hopefully we go we the ant can
survive a mosquito hit
there is no mosquito hey you know what
the ant is strong enough to kill the
fish the rare time that attack actually
mattered
bro
you're posting cringe you can't be
rolling
horses
in 2021 like
it's bad it's it's i hope that you see
i don't have a personal vendetta against
horses i'm just saying like if you
crunch the numbers from the streams you
would see
that we're killing them every time
like we lose the horses like 10 to 20 of
the time maximum maximum
get don't don't buff my ant okay that's
good
get get pill five for mosquito we don't
sweat that at all
buy me roll me
holy birch
crab me
buy me
combine me
we're gonna roll a temporary four squad
marty that i'll admit has a high lose
chance
but with good optics for the future
the the irony with the horse i think is
that i i genuinely believe that people
are like oh but it's fine i'll just use
horse early and then in the late game
like i'll sell it it's actually like the
opposite i think the only time you can
run horse is like the same way you can
run duck like you can buy it
put it down on the board buff the units
that you summon after that and then
pivot off it immediately like the early
game one hp is just you lose
i'm sorry i don't mean to get so heated
buff my fish you piece
oh
that's gaming
that's gaming
i'm happy with nothing here
we're nihilus mr lebowski
we believe in nothing
yo point crow what's up saw some some
pokemon shield last night
or so sword i always get those two
things confused
we lose these but only because we were
against someone who had a better squad
camel's kind of sick
i think it's not sick enough though
otter's kind of sick it's kind of sick
true
we love to see that honestly i'll be
real with you we'd love to see this and
then the classic meta build here is you
just toss a kangaroo back here and then
you never lose again i'm making one
mistake our mosquito should not be at
the front our mosquito should be
second from the back
what an interesting squad you've got
here where'd you learn this twitch.tv
slash northern lion
just kidding except not really at all
you're so unlucky we win these
i was about to get a little mad
okay so you're going here
honestly you're going here now what what
gets replaced mosquito and otter don't
have to exist anymore
that's true
i would prefer not to roll giraffes in
their stead
but i will admit
you probably could
if and if we're gonna pivot
the best time to pivot is right away
we can at least fit that in temporarily
don't care for another mosquito quite
frankly
i'll be on no freeze me freeze me
anytime a sentence starts with i'll be
honest you know i'm about to do just
about like the dumbest you've ever
seen um i'm very happy with this we'll
add a fish to the ecosystem next time
it'll buff our crab which will buff our
kangaroo
let's go we're so lucky we're actually
so lucky
the mosquito it it's making its play to
stay in this world but it's not gonna
work
but if the mosquito didn't hit there
this whole round gets screwed up like we
might actually lose instead we just you
know steamroll
it's four wins one loss you love to see
it
we're round seven that's interesting
we can play a
seal i say no to this but i'll admit
i'll admit maybe we're not really
feeding anything
you know what
freeze me for a sec
i kind of just like an otter
because it buffs a fish
look i bought the otter as like a random
apple it didn't really work out but life
goes on we're gonna try to make a seal
work here i would feel a lot better if
we just won this round
because then
we're so lucky dude if we won this round
if our seal doesn't work what are we
gonna do cry about it i don't think so
because we're gonna i've already paid
out the
believers okay so that's five i guess
we're one away we're one away still
um but that's okay
sell me
buy me
so we get this sick buff
lovely
you buff two in a row right and you're
buffing the crab that's good
i'm gonna have you eat real quick
maybe it's sick i don't know
we could fit a bison instead of a
giraffe
it's interesting at least bison buffalo
whatever what am i talking about no it's
a bison
it's a bison you don't try to trick me
i'm capable of tricking myself
dude this squad's kind of like doing
something have you noticed that about it
like our kangaroo is gonna run wild on
you
there's no doubt about that
like that's a that's a kangaroo with no
investment in it like it's just crazy
it should not be that good so we know
we're going to roll a bison temporarily
we're going to sell this to maximize the
odds of the salad hitting our seal
you're a piece quite frankly
you but you already knew that
give me two of these move them back
slightly
believers get paid out i think we need
to scale a little faster though
holy crap at least it's only a level one
rooster
is still pretty bad
holy crap we win these
[Laughter]
oh man
just by the the skin of our teeth on
that one but
tough luck
dude the crabs got to start like
self-inheriting at some point like
it's popping
please
it's a nice squad like it it's very well
balanced but it's not the way i
typically like to build i'm pretty
scared of this 30-29 uh
dog back here i think if we're gonna get
this squad to pop we really need our
kangaroo to get buffed but our fish is
actually too busy killing right now
kind of unfortunate they got a double
fly like a parrot fly
it's a bit unusual our crab will attack
a few times i i think we lose this
though
it's hard for me to believe that we
managed to cut you down here yeah that's
a good squad it's an interesting squad
make the casino seven wins you piece
it's my favorite part of the stream
where people with red doubt or flare
next to their name blame the casino for
their bad bet
after they've lost but before i click
the choose outcome button
one of these days i'm gonna feed that
seal man it's gonna happen
in battle in battle it could work but
there we go
get owns okay
we need to keep the fish around
we're not gonna double up on a king
honestly like the crab kind of doesn't
have to exist anymore
and it pains me to say that but
i think if we're gonna win this
we need to sell a crab and and put some
faith on the kangaroo put some respect
on the kangaroo's name
it's unfortunate
or is it
it's not unfortunate i'm amazing
i'm accidentally very good at the game
oh no my tiger
don't care for a monkey here
buff me
like
maybe it's not the seals faults
but i do feel like the seal
has cemented its status as like a a d
tier unit here
that's that's mighty nice though as long
as we can get a replacement tiger
that's mighty nice
you pass the bison
every time i told you i don't know what
it is my my brain is actually bison
blind
i was not just putting on airs you can
see it for yourself the proof is in the
pudding man
we live in here we live in here
that seems kind of bad that seems kind
of sick
that seems kind of bad that seems kind
of sick that seems kind of sick
we draw these
i'll take that
honestly i'm about to
don't i'm not looking at check cause
chad's gonna hate this
you don't understand you don't know what
i know you don't know the things that i
know yet okay get this trash out of here
we're not gonna have enough money
buy a cat
put a seal at the front
buy a cow
milk
on the bison
even though i know you're like why not
put it on the seal because our bison
needs to be fodder right now for the
kangaroo the seal is for salad hits
and you don't make friends with salad
now hold on i know you're going to be
like next level bison
there's something to that
there's something to that
that was not smart you should not be
here
we're buffing a scorpion what i meant to
say is that's the smartest thing i've
ever done we're going big scorpio
should have gone with the pair instead
but you know hold on this will work this
will work
this is this is actually horrendous
you peace you please you peace you peace
all right we oh because i sold my level
three
that's a good point yeah okay oh we got
one more round look yo let's go i
thought we were dead we've just gotten
started though
okay you didn't do what you you needed
to do so sorry to tell you you're gone
we're still buffing you the buff still
has to happen
it'd be nice if you had like a melon
armor
or like
anything at all really even garlic yeah
because i was a little worried that this
could happen and then it did single
scorpion just just blew us away double
bison are you kidding me
oh well there's still eight wins
pay it out pay it out
please it's 75 25 in the bets every time
well but i can't i can't adjust the line
to make it 50 50. okay because of if i
adjust the line to make it 50 50 then
what are we gonna do about the people
who always bet underdog because i can't
resist the odds and then lose and then
say i had no choice the odds the odds
what am i gonna that contingent is like
40 of my viewership right now



slash marker sap does that say p3 we're
gonna run it back true true true that's
true
i'm gonna run it back we're keeping the
casino here you've been appraised
like when you lose to the casino you
roll up to the
um the front desk and be like excuse me
can you please remove those green
numbers from the roulette table
no just put your money in vt sax
now we're talking hit hit the fish
please hit the fish hit the fish at the
fish
we hit those um
don't talk to me about this name
this is the same damn squad
i'm going to go ahead and say we
probably draw
you can roll a mosquito
mosquito's pretty amazing as an ant
sniper let's get anti-snipe technology
and then add a shooter of our own
i also i like the fact that the bets
consistently end up being uh hold on
shoot my ants within the matter i shoot
your fish two twos two two that's two
two that's two two two two that's two
yeah we win these
i like when the odds are like three to
one because it means when doubters win
they get a juicy payout
i think that works out nicely quite
frankly
it's been as high as like nine to one
too
okay i'll be straight up
don't don't
let's go kill me
i can live with that
welcome to the damn squad
welcome to the damn squad
sell me this is so stupid
buy me
sell me
cupcake me
i i just saw i saw a scampi line i just
saw a scampi line and said to myself
this could be fun
please hit the ant hit the ant you so
whatever we win these
yeah we definitely win these
very good scampi we got we got a little
lucky on the scampi but that's that's
totally fine roll me
trash animals quite frankly
you could definitely
fit a turtle in here um we want more
gold more gold enables more shrimp
scampi
the mosquito is not long for this world
i would rather put meat on the fish
that's a big freeze for next round meat
on the fish for now dude this
this is why you can't just memorize
builds you have to have the problem
solving in your head i know you didn't
believe your teachers when they told you
that at school
can't we just look in the back of the
book for the answers that's a life skill
the problem solving
is going to do us well in the long term
by the way we're definitely gonna lose
this one but that's just cause ox is op
past crab the crab works in many
situations it doesn't work in this
situation i'm and this is where people
will be ashamed here comes the shame
we're definitely going to come
bind you we're definitely going to buff
you we're definitely going to sell you
we got a fast shop that's highly blessed
we're going to buy a pig we're going to
sell a pig
you're going to buff the fish thank you
so much we're going to buy a beaver
we're going to sell the beaver it's
gonna buff the fish
it's gonna okay mosquito buff i'll
accept it i'm a little upset but i
accept it um
we'll probably try quick buy buff the
fish please thanks so much i really
appreciate it we're gonna freeze this
we're gonna sell you real quick probably
buff the swan you know what that's all
right i'm not i'm not trying to be like
addicted to the three squad marty or
whatever give me a freeze roll me once
your trash freeze me
place me here place me here freeze me
and i'm spent
this looks okay
this looks okay
this looks okay is that a 10-9 horse
10-9 horses
are dying anyway
like they just are not good please stop
you're embarrassing yourself
now like mosquito has been fun
not as fun as it's about to be though
that's a definite by me
hate to see that that's a definite sell
me
there's some theory here
that's a buy me to sack me
to freeze me to roll me
to buy me
honestly to sell me
i can live with this to roll me i'm
actually i've lost my mind this is not
the way you should be playing this we
gotta either combine or dump these
scampi's
this is what we are doing right here is
asinine
we deserve this loss in a huge way
i i just i get too into the shrimp man
like there's so much fun even though
they're obviously horrible
we can at least make a six seven like at
least you can do something
now we gotta fill this squad let's do
this
another scampi huh
perhaps i was too hasty
freeze me roll me
[Laughter]
well i guess we are kind of close to a
level three what i was gonna say is
we're not close to a level three but
that's actually just a lie
anyway we win these can you believe it
any time you win a round
retroactively was the right decision to
try a duck
this is just i'm i'm on a new level man
like i don't even know what i'm doing
anymore
we're getting combines out where we're
getting the greatest buffs you've ever
seen in your life i don't know man sure
let's toss a crocodile into the squad
that could be fun yeah yeah why not
why not
toss me a crocodile freeze me
we've received the some kind of delivery
i've noted i'm just looking
i'm just looking
i'm just looking
we're not being robbed okay
um
honestly toss me a king
don't don't you do me like that
i can live with this okay
i can't believe the believers are still
in play
anytime you kill something with a croc
that that
raises your chances of winning we love
to see that our kangaroo freaking lives
you summon a deer big whoop you summon a
bus i'm just gonna be honest with you i
think you
did not run a good squad there i think
that squad had no chance
i don't think there was ever a world in
which that went differently
you need garlic it's it's time finally
for the buffs
i thought about trying a worm there okay
i i genuinely did why don't you freeze
me
to be honest with you it's kind of like
a sec penguin build but i'm gonna do a
quick sell
and then you could do a buy sell but i'd
rather just buff you
might as well although we give two
health two health would be worth more
than one one but you can't guarantee it
lands on the right unit get a nice
little buff nice little buff and the
frankenstein team is off to the races
hello
thank you
thank you
why skip the bison i think you could
freeze a bison
but uh
we don't have a level three so like
right now i i just genuinely think a
bison is kind of like dudes here
just curious like why you're still
rolling horses in your game
believers get paid out
roosters kind of crack don't get me
wrong i don't even know what i'm doing
here because none of my units have
synergies at all
like they're just they just exist
i feel like i need a swan to get to a
higher level to
pay me more in the future
even though our fish is closer to
leveling
come on man come on you know what i've
probably never gotten it to that level
sure sure
i've probably never gotten a level three
shrimp let's look at possible
achievements here
oh no you sniped my penguin
big whoop we're gonna win this one
that's so stupid
oh man
i'm stunned
you could definitely fit a a snake into
this build i think i'm just going to
keep it frozen for a little while here
for for the time being
hmm
the best part about this is that i'm not
even rolling like i'm not even selling
anything anymore
it's holy birch
buying selling
him me him him me it's supposed to be a
sell me by me build and i'm just like
i'm just going oh no
that's terrible news man a 41 12 crab
is my monitor upside down
it's great oh nevermind it's not great
it's not great at all
um
i'm loving the buffs don't get me wrong
but i think we need to play a counter
build right here him me sell me buy me
no sell me buy me
you know what you know what i know we
literally just buy you thanks for the
sell thanks for the buy
thanks for the cell
thanks for the cell
melon
not necessary overrated this is a
definite by me selmy
thank you so much
i'd love to see another scorpion
if not then it's very simple just give
me a buy give me a cell
toss me a quick little snake back here
free wins
okay we lose this
[Laughter]
like in a huge way
but it is what it is
free wins for who for the believers who
get paid out again
complete prediction okay i'm going to
throw a slash marker
then i'm going to go to the bathroom i'm
just going to hit a quick add break
because i got to pee really bad i got to
take a 10-1 sound speed
see you in a couple minutes
so
ah
[Laughter]
laughs
laughs
so
hello hello i am back hello
yeah so like i i mean if you weren't
here at the top of the stream i
understand like uh
i
was excited to play some forza today
um but
i encountered a apparently a common bug
where the game just
doesn't boot
and the only way to fix it is to turn
off your streaming software which i'm
not willing to do because i want to
stream it so um
you know it's my loss don't get me wrong
we're gonna finish
with some sap
run his admin
i had i had tried that don't worry
so we're running it back play arena what
are we dude honestly
put me back on pay to win
it's my loss
it's now or never
ow
freeze me but give me some beetles man
you don't even give me any insects
is this a joke
i mean
a three one that sits on the back line
maybe snipes you i'm willing to give it
a chance did i know i didn't run the
casinos yet okay hold on salty baguette
my mistake my mistake
start prediction
there you go we always let it's like you
know
hockey we let the bets roll into the
first period it's kind of crazy like our
squad sucked okay
and yet we still
drew
which is it basically should not happen
why don't you versus mode scared of
losing well i've discussed this uh in
the past the reason i don't do versus
mode is not because i'm scared of losing
it's because i'm scared of losing uh not
the game but my life because
i've watched mouth play
and uh you know my average turn length
in super auto pets
probably we're looking at something like
i don't know 30 seconds
uh the timer in verses is three minutes
and in mouse lobbies they go to time
literally every single round
so
it's just uh it's just too much man it's
just too much
the verses rounds like they're gonna
last like hours
maybe not hours
but minutes
certainly minutes
combine me
this could be interesting sell me
you're a piece honestly
sell me now we got a 4-2
and i'm thinking maybe we can start
buffing a swan here slightly i'm willing
to roll for better units dude we don't
need to roll for better units we already
got the best dang units there are
a dog on round three
i'm thinking okay
this might lower our chances of winning
this round which i would consider okay
we
here you know what you do we run you
right
okay we're gonna we do you at the front
you kill a flamingo or an ant and live
you attack one more time probably die
then there's one good unit behind it's
probably like a 7-4 like a peacock or
something like that or bluebird trades
with you and owns you
and then you go what is this allowed and
i go yeah it's allowed it's called the
meta sweetheart
all right mission failed
we will not get them next time this this
went wrong
it's okay hey you can't you can't win
them all right or something um you get
out of here
this is a big buy me
big buy me four six
five five
that's amazing
i wish you could sell uh you could like
give a bat to the store
and be like can you just give me one
gold and then next turn i'll pay you one
gold to get it back
because i want to like sell you so i
have enough to buy like a blowfish just
to buff you for more
and then i'll i will pay for the
privilege to get my own unit back next
time but if if you're not willing to do
that i understand
if you're like scared or whatever it
would be i combined you by accident like
a fool what am i thinking what's wrong
with me i was just trying to drag and
now i'm ashamed of my words and my deeds
going offline guys send ending every
sentence with an upward inflection and
then adding some vocal fry
this is bad this is not good
that did not hit the right unit
you know what we'd lose this
[Laughter]
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah we lose yeah yeah fair enough
we are this is pawn shop meta
yo i'm just pogged about some stuff from
okay slow down you're you're playing
like a fool with your pants on the
ground the shops going so fast
this is okay this is okay this is okay
okay we got one win two losses
level two dog is actually sick though
like actually disgusting you we we have
a whale that is eating um a squirrel
for some reason
i don't know what's going on with that
but i thank you so much
you're out of here for now thank you for
your first that that help you gave us
earlier though was quite nice thank you
so much
honestly feel like some garlic could do
us a favor in the future
this is not a bad buy
followed by a cell buff the dog let's go
followed by a buy
followed by a cell
for gold
give me a flamingo
save the oh save the garlic for next
time remember your combined strats
remember your combined strats we've got
some momentum here this was this was a
good round
i see
i see that i'm looking very nice in my
opinion i'm looking very nice
that swan's not gonna make it
we win these big bad bezos excuse me
you're trying to get me banned
takes us to three wins now we're now
we're doing something now we're doing
something
i would love to
pill you but you know what perhaps you
saved us some gold we summon you love to
see the hp more than anything else i'd
love to see the hp don't make me laugh
don't make me laugh
we say nothing
hatching chick is like disgusting
i know you're like what about a buffalo
yeah how about you uh keep your winds
buffalo
and i'll keep mine buff a high because
we're gonna buff this dog to the
freaking sky
18 27
good year
buffalo is better dog source dude just
trust me
okay that takes us to four
you don't need to fish anymore
you've served your porpoise
welcome
i mean caterpillar's kind of sick
what was i thinking
you know what actually this is okay it
gave us kind of a sick buff
and then we'll just buy you a pair and
freeze nothing for our next turn
now we got a 2235 duck at the front
she came down in a duck dug
oops
man honestly one of the most cracked
strategies in this game literally have
one really good unit drunk kai
i'm just dude i've been in the the sap
mines for like two and a half hours
before that i was
uh easily winning an inscription
2021's second best game of the year
like my brain is freaking fried it's
just toasted
i'm gonna be honest with you i think you
buy nothing here
even though a poodle's some good eats
i think you buy nothing i think we we
buff you
you don't need a mammoth any buy sells
here not really this is a non-buy sell
round this is a buy
that's the cell
takes us to five which is a beautiful
situation
i'll be honest with you i think you do a
buy
i think you do a cell
and i think you
rearrange your squad like this
temporarily give your swan a little
extra benefit
i can't even see they put like a
censored tab because the attack defense
is so disgusting no
level two bad all you had to do all you
had to do at one job
all you had to do
was land weakness on a scorpion and you
said no
even though you had a 40 chance how
embarrassing is that
okay we freeze you
we sell you
we roll you we don't care for the
hatching chick
i don't think we can make it work we can
definitely do a buy sell
i'm very much eager to see a scorpion
honestly we're a little late to care too
much about getting a level three dog i
think
though it's always got some degree of
temptingness
i think we can freeze it and see if we
survive this round but for the time
being we're very much eager to see like
a
scorpion like we're really
kind of pot committed we don't see a
scorpion okay that's fine that's fine
that's fine
instead
we will instead of giving you plus two
plus two with a man i'm just gonna give
you plus two plus two i think we win
this
i honestly think we win this this is the
doubter
um the doubter believer paradigm all you
needed to do was not hit a scorpion we
didn't hit a scorpion i'm feeling pretty
good i'm feeling like your melon armor
is not worth too much i'm feeling like
your garlic armor is not worth too much
i'm feeling like your garlic armor is
not worth too much i'm feeling like your
kangaroo's not worth too much
believers win again
that's why you gotta have faith
now we can buy now we can start to think
about a long-term future
doesn't anybody see how fricked up this
is this is anti-scorpion technology
because i know the game loves to give
scorpions
we're gonna buy a dragon we're gonna
pivot off of
this build we're gonna get some dragons
going the swan is is ready to go
i don't mind this in the slightest
i mind it we lose we lose
however
believers win and that was close
that was mighty close
we've done it again that's two sixes in
a row
am i trying to massage the bets by
suggesting that maybe doubt is incoming
maybe yes maybe no
who who could possibly say this is a
nice little squad here
be a danish shovel
easy money easy money
interesting
uh we draw these i can do it mosquito
honestly here is a clickbait title for
the future mosquito
most underrated unit in the game
i honestly think people sleep on the
mosquitoes value is kind of sick
i think i i think i gave it a a mid b
tier
in my
legitimate tier list i think it actually
might be
low a tier i'm not saying it's the best
early game unit but i think it's it's
maybe like third best
so we can roll this we can roll this
this is the dang squad man well honestly
like we
freeze you
you know what no i think it's more
i think it's more valuable
to have another
don't
i think it's more valuable to have a 3-3
than a 2-4
when we've already got
like if if the other option would be a
2-4-2-2 i think a 3-3-2-3 works better
just due to the composition of most
people's teams people gee this people
gee this
the more units you have that have more
than two hp the more likely you are to
win
g
no
that's terrible luck anyway
uh we win this
okay ant gets
that could have been bad ant gets killed
don't hit fish
lovely we love that
buy me one of these buy me one of these
if this is the dang squad then this the
dang squad quite frankly will will
combine these sons of guns fit a
dromedary into the deck
this is not a top-tier squad but i feel
pretty okay
i feel very bad
this fish is gonna be a nightmare the
peacock behind it is gonna be
disastrous this is for sure a loss
but the dromedary is like a duck but
good
sell me
i hate to say it man
sometimes you gotta do it
it's a little late for a dog but like
you still kind of gotta do it sometimes
toss me one of these woof sell me please
buff this dog
i mean it's a very similar looking squad
i would not dispute this five five five
six four
maybe if she's five foot two
the squad is too balanced right now
i think the reason the dog is
good
is not because it's so like insanely
cracked by itself
i think the real meat and potatoes of
the dog is that it's one of the only
like consistent enablers that shows up
if you've got no other archetype
it's very easy to just see a dog and
then be like okay we're gonna try to do
this because i don't have anything else
taking up that space right now
okay six-six mosquito and we're we have
to get rid of something the thing we're
getting rid of is the thing that's
furthest away from leveling
you may disagree you may be right i may
be crazy you know what we got three hp
to work with
i'm going scampy
and then i'm selling our other high stat
unit
because i don't give a frick
we're gonna need some hp at some point
would you mind
honestly it's kind of sick
you're going to roll this first
then you're going to combine
then you're going to roll
a second bet
9 7 kind of kind of doo-doo
get get some turtles this is a the most
economical freeze you're ever gonna see
in your life honestly getting early
melon early melons not that cracked but
here's the thing just put it on a unit
that you don't need to have garlic and
then we're sort of talking
blowfish weakness is good but i still
think this is a guaranteed loss like the
stats are just so good
it's not even close really
okay we knew this was coming
it's a good buy
it's a great sell it's a good buy but
it's a great sell now let me tell you
i think we want garlic on our dog
i just peeled a damn swan
um
here's how here's how nl can still win
buy me
sell me
two turtles
lord have mercy give me a draw this
round give me a draw this round please
please please
oh son of a hold on hold on it doesn't
look that bad it's we can fix him we can
fix him
please please
we win these we win these
it's okay though cause i lose so much
scaling man i i lost i lost my swan
okay okay
look you need garlic but i'll settle for
some some of this right now
what am i doing like actually what am i
doing though
oh let's go
never mind i'm a genius
freeze me
two two two two two two him me and me
um
i mean you're buying a poodle
i'll be honest i don't really care about
buffing the dog i do care about buffing
the bat like it's really hard to get
this all to fit but
i'll the bat's gonna stick around i'm
not sweating that
this looks kind of this looks kind of
freaky oh no you killed my shrimp those
are useless man
they're actually useless
i definitely do not believe it but we
win these
okay i'm starting to i'm starting to
think
[Laughter]
summon me
no no no
buy
cell
it's still kind of a sick bat you got
gotta be honest freeze
buy
do not sell
freeze freeze
you're level one so the order is not
that
big of a deal okay okay new meta pill
your second best unit
it's horses
level three horse you know what that
means
that means there's a chance
don't shoot my shrimp let's go we win
these
oh we got two hp to play with
i can't i i'm i'm stunned as we speak i
can't believe it
that's why like if you
needed one more proof of concept that
like a horse build cannot work
you just got it
i hate the panting sound
you know what why not
please god this would be so sweet
it's a nasty team we replaced the things
we needed to replace
that's fine
that's fine
that's fine you're level
you're a level one bus we don't sweat
that annoying but whatever life goes on
um i still think you own me
what do you expect i mean they had
turkey that's like that's a classic play
so we're on five wins
it's now time for you to go
it's a sell me get out of my face get
out of my face it's a buy me
sell me
roll me
buy
me sell me
buy me
sell me
buy me
sell me
buy me that's just the mathematical way
you play that
round 10 this squad can win it can also
definitely lose
what are you shooting my hatching chick
oh no
here's a quarter call somebody who cares
oh wait there isn't anybody because
nobody cares
we win these believers
i don't know if there's been a more
bullish signal for believers in super
auto pets history than me spending one
gold to kill a good unit and still
safely carrying 71 of the points
to their logical outcome
i don't think it's ever happened before
in earth's history quite frankly
it's that's that's an amazing scenario
that's the stuff that dreams are made of
and who knows i'm starting to think that
maybe pilling the swan was actually like
the way to go
safely okay maybe for a moment people
got a little scared but that's not my
responsibility
honestly you don't need pears like come
on man
i mean that's a give me this is a give
me as in give me that
freeze me
kill the dog next
there's just no way
[Laughter]
oh my god it's the clutches scorpion in
earth's history okay
you're owned you're owned you're owned
and you're owned okay we're still dude
the squad at the back is not like
they're not that nasty either like
they're doing some great stuff in in
their own right i'd love to get another
scorpion back don't get me wrong but
first we're gonna do a little by me
he's gonna do a little sell me
i thought i sold the dog you're gonna do
a little by me
you're definitely gonna do a little sell
me a little selmy and louise
you're gonna roll me
we don't need to level up dog at this
point like it's already it's getting
buffed by by a variety of sources
it's tough i wanna you know what i'm
gonna i'm gonna play the coward strategy
i'm going to buy a unit
no no no no
i'm going to buy a unit
we definitely should have bought the
fish
and then i'm gonna give melon armor
to my poodle because it's the second
best unit 2327 ain't no joke dude that
ain't no joke
what the heck is this
the run respector has logged on i don't
know what that was but i'll take it as
eight wins
sell me
buy me
sell me
buy me
i just don't understand the hedgehog
into killing your own scorpion i i'm
gonna go ahead and guess that they were
actually like they were playing it up
for a meme and i respect that
i respect that a lot i i respect the
crap out of that quite frankly
i think that was a stream sniper but it
was like the the pub g version of like
stream honking where you just remember
birdman i don't know if birdman's still
around we used to see them
uh every round of pub g
they would land like far away from us
and then every once in a while you would
just hear like a
and then you would see one of the
motorcycles with a side car egghead
sleeps on seal by the way
well uh looks like uh
you're going to sleep permanently here
after getting dominated
and then anyway birdman would take um
his motorcycle off of a ramp
and then just blow it up
like
land it upside down so that it exploded
and then you would see him show up in
the uh
in the kill feed it was it was a great
time
the greatest stream sniper in history
dude we're actually
genuinely gonna have a shot at getting
10 wins
that's so funny
[Laughter]
could it could definitely still lose but
like considering the
no we're fine
we win i think we win
all right well you know it was kind of
close for a moment there it appeared
that we might actually uh
not even get six wins
and then look at that there's ten
choose outcome yes
[Laughter]
after getting after standing up
because i was so disappointed in myself
after standing up
i can play this man
came through in the clutch early dragon
kind of sick for sure
be the sniffing herbs
oh me
yeah i'm the sniffing
do you see some oregano in your house
the sniffing herbs
uh i don't know what i need you to shoot
to win here this might just be a loss
that uh like when you get two otters
like it's kind of cracked yeah two two
otters wins rounds
i don't sweat that
that's that's life that's life in the
new meta
more units with three hp equals more
wins forget green beetle it's too late
if you showed up first we wouldn't have
had a problem
but you showed up late bro like
the the horse lovers are just okay
phrasing maybe
okay you you know what with the ideal
squad against my sub-optimal swadd
we drew congratulations
you you managed to sneak a draw out
start me here don't hit the ladybug
though
i can live with that
you have to
and then you just roll an end to the
front again this is a pretty nasty squad
early on
this ain't so bad
look i did say sub-optimal swot what is
this team
i'm actually just annoyed because i
think they might no okay they're not
going to beat me what is that team
horse meat at the front is like i never
seen that before
sell me
bats are good but a swan is is nice i
mean two bats though man roll me once
okay pill me
i like it
i'm gonna say this is a roll me roll me
stay frozen
we're gonna get a level up next time
pill the swan
[Laughter]
please we don't let this become a thing
we just lost to a
to a a rat
bit spooky
a bit spooky to lose to a rat quite
frankly uh i think deer plus weakness
does some incredible work
so i think we say bye-bye to our fish
it's been nice while it lasted
although
because you know what economically i'm
actually going to say bye swan
i would love to roll a llama here
um
but i'm i'm harboring you know the the
believers
money i'm harboring their points
as a result i don't feel like it would
be prudent to
uh run a llama because i feel like the
believers have trusted me with their
with their precious points
quite frankly and i
i've honestly like
you trying to get me to run a llama i
think is is heavy doubter energy
that was an incredibly good setup for us
we got a little lucky and i'm happy to
see it
now how do we draw twice but still keep
something scaling here the answer is you
get rid of a fish
for something that scales
or
you buff your fish
and you level it up next turn
okay don't be mad
but a bison would be sick here and also
don't be mad
but a uh
it wouldn't be the worst thing in the
world if we lost here
it wouldn't it wouldn't
we're so lucky we're so lucky people are
still rolling horses
i mean of course
and then i'm kind of like i mean i guess
of course
you're just actually like
just come off it man
you know what
we're going to sell a deer
or a fish
to make a worm work
but we need to wait a turn
so for now
just take a slice of this
put some meat on somebody who could do
something with it get a little nasty
with it
again when i see a four squad i'm very
scared a four squad actually scares me a
great deal because it seems like
somebody who knows what they're doing
never mind
never mind
so you're gone
yeah you're if that that gave me some
confidence that we can do this you're
you're alive freeze me just in case
because this is a scary pivot give me
one of these
give me one of these we've already
basically replaced the fish with a
better fish
look at this like it's a nine nine
already that's that's lovely
we're getting close to the level where
our caterpillar won't be transforming
into something worse than itself
this is very scary
this is a very good squad from our
opponent
but we crush you we crush you
we crush you
we we own you
we win these
who would have thought
that's five dude it's gonna be a pure
believer stream today maybe we do need
to raise the cap
ah nevertheless uh roll me mmm
freeze me buy me
roll you know what you know what for the
time being
do this i know this is real freaky but
do this
not pure you did lose once wait a minute
is that true
what's happening
what's happening man
i couldn't even follow what was going on
there
okay well you know what we could doubt
here this could be a doubter that was a
beautiful build whoever was rolling that
congratulations because that was a
beautiful build
i got nothing but respect for you
you peace
straight up
if we get a turtle
i'm putting the system on trial
you're in okay i know we're like
minimizing our turtle odds here but just
relax or don't you peace
well okay hold on
that's pretty solid
no i haven't played the new forza
eliminator yet i need to uh
i need to figure out
how to get the game to work on my uh
computer
because it doesn't rate now and my
unfortunate expectation is that
i'm like waiting for a patch that's
never gonna come
this this is a crap shoot right here man
this could go either way
but i i'm eager
oh we win these by the way i am eager
to test it
believers win again who would have
thought
roll me
a turtle will show up at some point and
it's gonna it's gonna change the game
it's gonna change the way the game's
played
don't even talk to me about a bison i do
not respect it
uh this late in the game
we might as well sell you and get an
extra roll out of this
okay you now no longer are relevant but
a turtle is very relevant if we can get
one
let's freeze it so we can think about it
later
dump your bat come on now come on
come on
dump the bad like
are you joking me
this might be a modestly
controversial take
i think that they should actually
i'm i'm doing this without data okay
i think they should make it so melon
armor is like a legit
protection
because like the the counter to melon
armor
is just a little just a little too easy
to get over i don't know how it would
change the game
it might make the game unplayable
absolutely not
all right i'd like to say that that last
thing i just said that everyone
disagreed with was a bit that was just a
joke
and if you bought into it then you just
got trolled
pretty embarrassing for you couldn't be
me
now we're talking
good bit good bit thank you
we trade with this this worm you trade
with this worm
we trade with this one that's okay
hold on hold on we still win these
this is kind of crazy man
i'm i forgot that i was good at this
game
until just now but like we're kind of
popping just roll here's what you do
okay this put me in the clip put me in
the clip hi hi livestream fails nl has
giga brain read you roll once you go to
six gold you see a t-rex you buy the
t-rex you level up it's gonna give you
something stupid probably i'm gonna say
a sauropod which i'm not interested in
whatsoever then we're gonna end our turn
we're gonna have three extra gold which
is gonna allow the t-rex to give
everything plus four plus four at which
point chad's gonna go three gold
you're
we were this close we were this close to
greatness
if you had been a different kind of long
green thing
you never know man you never know
please weaken the puppy no okay this
this could have it in for us man this
puppy's kind of strong this puppy's kind
of cracked we lose these
honestly we lost because we couldn't
clip farm
either way believers win again
and you know what let's run we got time
for one more today good stream today
went by fast man i played inscription
like 2.5 times longer than i thought i
would and had a wonderful time and i
just love super auto pets to begin with
run me
roll me
buff me buff me freeze me
the cheesy chunks disgusting
disgusting
disgusting
so i watch a lot of kitchen nightmares
um you yeah we lose these spelunky god
versus lord of spelunky
disgusting
romy
i don't i don't want to
though
um i don't want to three ants is is too
much instead you got to throw a beaver
in here
lemme's on kitchen nightmares i
is that what costs
do you you don't even have to ask like
if i'm watching the the kitchen
nightmares youtube channel it's it's
probably the we lose these by the way
it's like the greatest channel in the uh
in existence but you know it
they they posted a video that's like you
know gordon ramsay's brain melts trying
to have fresh frozen explain to him
gordon ramsay's melts down through the
floor gordon ramsay gets mind freaked by
someone trying to explain
what cheeses are inside of this frozen
ravioli
and uh
so kate was browsing through youtube and
she was like hey have you seen this one
and i'm like i i have but i will watch
it again in a heartbeat
the answer is i've seen all of them
because they literally are using like
the same 30 episodes of kitchen
nightmares and just
repurposing clips over and over and over
again
and i watch him every time man i love it
when they're like what kind of cheese is
in this the waiter's like i gotta go
check
and then they're like it's like
partially hydrogenated vegetable cheese
substance
you don't even it's not even real cheese
disgusting
it's not even what he sounds like like
at all anyway this is like this is a
very scary time for us okay
i think we have to do this
i think we have to do this
i think we have to do this
you may not
believe
what i'm trying to accomplish here
and i don't blame you
all i'm going to say
is that we we deal with the tools we
were given these are the tools that we
were given
to draw this round would be a a gift
of sorts and we will actually win this
round which is better than a gift
that's very nice
okay
we're gonna do a little selmy
and louise we're gonna do a little selmy
and louise that's the perfect outcome
there we're gonna do a by me
we're going to peel you
hit the dodo
that's okay it's still good it's still
good we're gonna roll
we're not going to roll a dog
we are going to
buy an otter
that's amazing we're going to not risk
the otter hitting itself and i accept
that
and we're gonna roll a four squad marty
that's really a one squad marty
this would be a great time to get some
garlic armor
lucky
we need all that oh not not that lucky
this has got to be a loss we're look i'm
just gonna own up to it okay this is
what it takes to lose to horses
is like you need the shop that we had
like in our first three rounds
but this is where you will very quickly
become ashamed because that's a gimme
that's beautiful don't sell me yet just
roll
me i'm going to take a cell me and
louise
uh if you want to win rounds you can do
worse
than an ox
we're on round five
i i don't care for a penguin necessarily
yet but
we'll take another dodo we'll start
pilling things in front of the ox
and
like
believers i would be scared right now
but like this 11 12 fish can do some i
think we lose i'm just gonna be honest
i think we might be going bye bye here
i'm trying to see how how conceivably
you know what we're gonna draw
we draw
[Laughter]
okay okay okay
pill me
i'm gonna say thrill me
god i would love to see some garlic man
okay i mean we have to play this even
though we got a level two dodo next turn
we gotta play this for now i guess we
could have gone beaver then turtle
that's fair
pill me
freeze me
this is big this is big
this is very clutch melon armor it
completely nullifies your only good unit
now the kangaroo is going to be a little
spicy but it's going to lose to our ox
if it makes it that far
it's not gonna it's gonna lose to our
rabbit okay okay it's starting it's
starting it's starting to something's
starting
you're gonna pay for your whole seat
you're only gonna need the edge
now we could peel in front of the ox for
a buff no we're gonna peel you
so that
we get melon on the fish that's a gimme
we're gonna level up
i know what you're thinking
and i disagree
we're going to get a penguin
we're going to buff our
dodo out of necessity more or less we're
gonna freeze these two
and then starting on our next turn
we're gonna do
so much health on our fish it's going to
make your head explode
your head is going bye-bye dorothy
better put on her red slippers because
her head is going bye-bye
okay get owns
get owned obviously
get owned let's go let's go
you're gone
welcome
that's true i'm willing to gamble that
we're going to win this next round
toss me one of these just just for being
a part of it freeze me
i believe
then the worm starts popping
so we need a worm on the squad
oh worm
which means our ox has to go and i i've
loved it i've loved it it's time for the
ox to go though it
you did you you're the only reason we're
still in this game and for that i love
you and i'll never forget you you need
to eat real quick
because we need you to get to level two
as soon as possible there's no joke
there then we're going to give you one
of these
then we it's very simple we freeze the
scorpion
roll once
from this
we sell our cow
scorpion at the front is a very early
scorpion that's the kind of thing that
can definitely ruin somebody's life
case in point
we've made it to the threshold
we've made it to the threshold of belief
and doubt
many people thought this day would never
come
we can think about you here's what they
think about you i'd rather get a bunch
of food
honestly this one's for the believers
i don't fear
i don't fear
i fear nothing
believers win again
[Laughter]
oh
you had me going for just a minute there
you had me sweating a little bit i'm not
gonna lie i'm not gonna say you didn't
have me sweating yeah me sweating a
little bit okay
it's true
alas
nevertheless
now watch this
it's too late for the monkey
it's too late
instead of a monkey
sell my fish i'm silly i don't care
are you silly we're going big scorp
every time people are like okay here we
go here we go let me guess big scorp
okay here it comes
yeah yeah your abs you're darn right
here it comes
seven nine big score
doesn't need melon
doesn't need chili
doesn't need a steak that's that's the
sort of thing that'll cheese you off a
little bit you know what though how
about you take a little chili pepper
give it a try
too late too late for monkey freezes two
of them
that's a good point that's a good point
that's a good point okay it's not quite
big enough yet it's not quite there
that's fine
that's fine
um we lose these
yeah we lose these fair enough though
okay hey dude the fact that we got back
to belief on that one is kind of
incredible
and then we're gonna roll the fastest
speed run of this game you've ever seen
in your entire life no think only play
no think only play because we got five
minutes
no think only play our team will be the
bumbling bagels
perfect
five minutes no casino no casino because
there's no think only play it's only
play
sometimes on instinct you just win look
you lose to otters otters win the game
otters win the game never mind we win
these there's one win there's one win
okay we buy a fish we buy a mosquito we
roll
less than 10 seconds per turn is my goal
and turn here we go
no casino because i may lose i never
lose in the casino i'm i can create
infinite channel points just call me the
janet yellen of twitch
okay we lose these that's fine
i buy a mosquito i roll
i get upset because there's nothing here
i like
um i combine
and sell
and then i buff the fish the fish gets
buffed which means i roll a crab with
meat behind it
roll once
freeze a dog
i clicked the wrong button man
we win these
we win these we win these we win these
we win these look at that okay
dog me dog me
peace
okay get killed
love it love to see it buff me oh you
love to see that okay buff me

itself you just you do make friends with
salad you do make friends with salad you
do make friends with salad
pastern we win these
we still got two minutes left man this
is crazy i can't believe it a little
scared of that ox not gonna lie to you
it would be nice if my fish broke the
melon armor on the ox
that's exactly how that's going to go
down
and we win these that's four wins
buff
me
not not sold on it not sold on it
honestly like the fastest easiest turns
i've ever seen in my life
he's cracked he's cracked
all right this is nasty
this is why you got to fear the four
squads they got a strong four squad
whatever whatever whatever
i don't care i love it we win these
that's five
submit this to the speedrun
uh live.com whatever the website's
called
i don't really care i'm too busy pogging
right now roll me once give me a pair
please more salads sure don't mind if i
do
oops
you're so lucky
that you're only going to lose by like a
little bit
oh did so we draw these we draw these
this is where things start to get a
little dangerous we got one minute left
yeah true true that's true salad me
oh it's big garlic me for sure for sure
honestly i think the otter can go
we're going to replace it with one of
these sons of guns right here a little
dolphin action freeze me just in case
roll me once uh freeze me this is how we
win this is how we win
i'm actually seeing the code right now
as long as the hippo dies i'm thrilled
man oh
the dolphin is the greatest creature
are you seeing this
that's a believer win as we speak
i don't need this garbage honestly get
my mosquito out of here run a second
rabbit toss me one of these real quick
roll me
okay you stun locked me for a second are
you happy you proud freeze me
freeze me freeze me
i don't even know what i'm doing with
that garlic you're really gonna put
garlic on a dolphin i don't think so
i don't think so this looks like a
windmin this looks like a win to me
nice badger
nice badger
we win this what that seven wins are you
crazy
it's actually getting comical
i don't like this is not a meme like
it's genuinely just getting funny that i
consistently
uh
you know what get that crap out of here
i'll see you later
i consistently do better
on runs where i'm just speed running
then on runs where i take all the time
in the world to think like it's kind of
it's kind of insane
why would you sell a crab
because i we're rolling a dolphin
probably the greatest dolphin you'll
ever see this seems kind of bad
on the other hand it also seems kind of
cracked
you peace you're so lucky you're okay a
crab probably would have slapped you
there probably would have slapped you
there what do we got two two two two
that's two two
buy me
we're going as fast as we can
golfing me dolphin me dolphin me dolphin
me okay you know what
you had your chance
welcome back
[Laughter]
you got a different kind of flavor this
time though dude the chili might be a
little cracked against this white weeny
build i'm kind of i'm laughing
i don't know if we'll even get to use it
but
let's look at it's looking kind of
cracked though
looking kind of cracked honestly
never mind i think we might lose this
still
i think we're definitely going to lose
this still
okay that's fine this sparkly bob
congrats congrats congrats
okay probably toss you one of these real
quick
honestly at this point we'll probably do
something like
something like that that's a big freeze
roll me need some meats don't see some
meats roll me
toss me one of these we win this we
actually win this round
next turn we get the cat out there we
got a feeding frenzy it's a feeding
frenzy

whatever the spicy crab the crab rangoon
bunny's garbage um source dude don't

parrot of all time
is going to be a
a 348 parrot with no buffs on it at all
you're so freaking lucky
my parents already dead all right
regardless can i tell you what was that
eight wins
it's not too bad honestly given the
circumstances



hey everybody welcome back we've been
playing some super auto pets not sure if
you've heard of this game it's taken the
world by storm let's get started i play
oh what the heck
a little bit of a frosted beaver who
says no who says no anyway what um
buy me
buy me freeze me i i play
what is this we probably lose this early
by the way but
maybe the motherly pearls that's perfect
man not even like
double entendre perfect it's just like
you know we're clutching them i'm
clutching my pearls right now when i see
this squad that we're about to go up
against
have to imagine we probably lose these
have to imagine we absolutely lose these
i was playing some verses today against
other streamers
uh and i think i've got to get
back into the meta
just like what
uh so the play is actually
this
we're gonna get some nice level ups next
time we we can actually get a level
three immediately and go two levels up
but we might lose this round but i i
gotta get myself back in the meta
we actually draw these thank god and the
meta is we have four hp instead of the
five that we had in verses
so we got to be um a little bit
more coy
we got to be a little bit more precious
we got to we got to play a little bit
uh
safer i would say
we probably could have gotten such a
higher stat unit if we just combined
them all into the one instead of doing
oh no that that still worked that still
worked um
i'm honestly gonna take you
and i'm gonna freeze you and i'm gonna
roll once i'm gonna say no to that this
is this is a weird four squad but i i
believe in our 7-7 beaver
i do also need to that's totally fine
actually i do also need to say that i
think
the competition level should be lower
here
than it was in the streamer lobby where
it was cutthroat man it was cutthroat
the problem is i really don't want you
to get buffed
like i would rather you buff the ants
or the rabbit they're both
take your chances
that's fine i can live with that
cell puts us on 10 and we need to fill
three spaces
that's two strong units
i would buy an ant even i know we just
pilled one but i would buy one knowing
you can sort of keep it around for a
minute here dude i'll be honest with you
there is a part of me
it's not easy to do
but there's a part of me that's like you
know what
roll this
and the thing is so they're gonna bust
through here this is gonna help somebody
in here the the buff then you're gonna
go then when the hedgehog goes this is
like our it's our break point which is
like okay if you got a white weenie
squad we just shred it and then these
two units come through in the clutch
i'm really thinking that like if i could
level up my positioning i could become
like the morpheus of this game so i
don't know if this is good
so that's bad
but it's not as bad as it looks
it's worse
that what are you gonna do that's like
just a very lucky mosquito shot um you
can't be too upset we got two hp left to
work with dude honestly
it's a bit of a meme but why not give it
a try at this point i think we could
maybe try a puppy
i certainly think a little garlic here
goes a long way
and then you would not roll up but you
could maybe roll a puppy next turn
instead and maybe try something like um
we can still do that yeah maybe try
something like uh
like
like this
i don't know it's it's very strange
we're not building a sensible squad here
i'm basically memeing it up i don't know
what i'm doing i'm just this is my
warm-up build okay i'm just having fun
all i want to do is have some fun and
hey i got a feeling i ain't the only one
two damage to everything seems to affect
both of us pretty much equally
we do insanely badly against this turtle
and die immediately okay this isn't just
straight up not going well
um
get pilled it would be funny to pil you
pull the hedgehog you get to peel the uh
the ant at the same time hey that's good
value
don't don't don't don't don't don't
i'm kind of stupid
um
give me two of these
give him oh we got to keep two gold
no no no we're we're so dead i didn't
mean to buy him at the door
goodbye horses
this is just i don't know what to say i
have built myself like just a it's a
god-awful squad um
i definitely see myself
going down here
you know
the answer is look i don't even i almost
wanted to abandon that before i saw the
loss come in that was just a mess don't
talk to me let's let's not build five
beavers next time
the meta is not in a position to let
that build thrive people are they're
cutting you out here
you know people are ruthless right now
they're they got like 10 10 dogs on turn
three
i don't see how we lose this
but i i
you know what we draw
i still have to feel like
i don't know i guess there's no way
other way that could have gone that went
pretty well for them give me one of
these freeze me a mosquito
roll me
freeze me
i i like this i like what we got right
here
freeze me
bees me
then we get a 2 3 mosquito which is
actually i mean 3 hp is really good
we we want i don't like a b but to
trigger the plus one plus one on the
mosquito is is very nice i think
one one cricket
i respect it the run respector has
logged on
we we draw
but it was mighty close
mighty close man
i'm still feeling really good about
where we're at here so i think you
definitely wish to create a
four five you definitely take an early
puppy
we want to preserve two gold
i mean obviously you can pill but i
think what you do instead is roll
maybe we could keep you around for a
second and roll one more time just
trying to get like a good roll going and
dog and puppy
i think you could make them both work
but they're a little bit cannibalistic
you could definitely fit a bat into this
squad though so the puppy on turn three
is is a huge blessing we got plenty of
time to make it work even if this round
goes wrong this looks like it could be a
loss but it also looks like to be honest
with you like it could be a draw
they have a badger but like no honey
badger
doesn't bother me i i don't mind the
draw i'd like to win her earlier don't
get me wrong but
it is what it is um now you're gonna get
pills whatever you hit doesn't bother me
too much
that's the best i think
um
i would love a 3-4
i don't really want to put honey on
anything like i think i'm okay with this
and i'll roll one time that's right
you got to do it like this now i'm
remembering so let's get a 4-5 honey up
at the front yeah maybe if she's five
foot two
um
we don't really have any buffs that's
like that's the nasty part right now
um
like some garlic on our puppy and it's
gonna start to do some serious work
uh weakness kind of a hard uh elephant
counter huh like your elephant live long
enough to kill your whole squad
[Laughter]
that's so good
oh you
are so lucky but also well played well
played icy hot
well played that's fun not not being
facetious that's that's kind of
hilarious
take one of these we're about to start
winning that's why i'm not sweating it
we need to keep two gold around
i'm just gonna buff the puppy it does
more with the garlic armor than the shop
buff would give us here
okay now i don't know why we got you
with the front now that i think about it
but we got a 10-9 garlic puppy
dude please weaken the front
no no with garlic we live kind of
we're going down man they've been
bringing the squads have been bringing
the heat today i don't know what
happened like it's been introduced to a
wider audience and now people are like
did you get a 14-11
kangaroo is like turn five man it's
crazy
i know streamer washed streamer no
streamer not washed
streamer never washed
okay you gotta go because the swan is
more
important the snail obviously plays a
big part in this
the swan is critical to our our having
any chance to succeed long term we can
i'm just looking at the economics of
this we can totally fit in ants
and our swan is more likely to survive
than our mosquito we stay on two gold
i don't want to live in a world where a
1412 puppy can at least be competitive
here
weakness hasn't really been popping the
way i would want it to pop it's not that
bad
i was wondering like who was knocking on
my door is tomo dude this is actually
staggering
um
we have zero wins
it's round seven
i'm i'm kind of stunned
sure you can go
i don't see a world where where this
puppy doesn't get us there man at least
it doesn't like
do something for us like it's it's gonna
be a a 1916 garlic armor puppy up at the
front
i i'm we're going up against a full
garlic squad that being said
our garlic is better because our stats
are higher it's just the way the numbers
work out i don't believe it we got o in
okay
the the time for the great comeback is
is upon us here
sell me
yeah get back in the vernacular buy me
roll me
we don't have a level three
in many people will say it's too late
for bunny many people are incorrect in
my opinion i love that
23 20 8 8 9 10.
this doesn't seem so bad
i love when you snipe the thing the
deer's trying to eat oh my god it ate a
crab there they were gonna lose anyway
like our squad looked better but then
spitting out a default crab is just
hilarious okay have we
be careful who you make fun of in middle
school we're starting to pop again
you certainly need one of these
brontosaurus or
yeah bro sauropod hard to justify
however
poodle three two one two
him me him him me three two one two so
you would buy
scaling is insanely valuable
i really i want to roll a caterpillar
i am aware of the fact
that it's pretty unlikely to get there
but i also don't see how we
win
like 10 games
or even close to it um i don't see how
we win six games without getting another
unit as good as our puppy so i'm gonna
try i'm gonna try
i can live with it can i live with it
i can't live with it
dude i'm just leveling with you like
this is ruthless
that that squad being two wins has
shaken me to my core
can just call me the bet hedger
what's better
one three one three two two
or
let's just sum the stats there
so that's
eight health
four attack which is basically five
attack or
a b
it's the same
a b
gets us two four two four and a plus 1
plus 1 b
which is 5 8 again
um but
this is better because we have some
sellability based on it later
i'm just trying to it'll be the the
i mean
lust lush legs is good alliteration
glistering buttocks is pretty good but i
don't know what glistering is i know
what glissa ning is
shoot the shoot that yeah yeah
we win these we lose we draw these
okay okay dude i'm telling you the meta
has changed it's been ruthless lately
we can roll two ants we can freeze an
apple we can roll once we can freeze an
ants to level up next time and then
the buff
in my opinion should apply to the
mosquito because these guys are getting
buffed anyway it's i think getting
something to three hp is the most
important because so many animals do two
attack
this is a bit scary
don't buff the ant thank god you wanna
when their buff buffs an ant i say pog
we draw these
i can live with that i can live with
that
we have to
it's not my dream to create a level two
ants it's not my dream
roll me i think keeping a meat around is
not so bad it can be a difference maker
i do not love this
but i think to try to continue to win
some games
we can roll
a flamingo and then
make our
i'm gonna be honest i'm just gonna make
our ants hit harder
because i think our level two ant is
more likely to stick around for a little
bit than this mosquito that has not had
a second pair added to it yet i guess we
could have added it to a beetle or a
ladybug i should say but
hmm
what an interesting badger you got here
uh
i don't know who that worked worse for
but we're definitely going to lose this
one
okay
so this we're already like under the
scaling level
we gotta we gotta find a way to speed it
up this shop is not really doing it
i don't really want a level 2 flamingo
to truth be told
i do not mind
this is a very easy trigger
to get plus one plus one even for only
one round
and then i would love to add you to the
equation here then i would love to roll
once and i would love to get a bat
it's still good enough i know it didn't
look that amazing last time we'll freeze
a no no no we're not freezing that we'll
freeze the mosquito
and the ladybug in the hopes of leveling
up next time
because that we really need to get kind
of like an anchor unit to build around
this looks not i'm i i was gonna say it
looks not bad but it looks kind of bad
like how we gonna kill that elephant man
it it's like
the answer is we're not we're gonna
leave it alive with one hp
this is nasty all these anonymous like
uh hd dvd encryption code ciphers like
is is
it's never been more competitive out
here so a llama is not what we're
looking for
however
if there's ever been a time to mess with
it
maybe it's time to experiment so like
this will be a 4-7 immediately
and then of course it's like hey would
you like a selection of units that you
very much enjoy
um we'll put some garlic on which will
make our our beetle a little better as
well or our ladybug i should say we like
to keep one spot available for buying
selling
i don't know man like i'm i'm skeptical
that we're gonna do much else here but i
just like
i mean part of it is that i genuinely
think that the free to play there's no
way we're killing an 1819
um ladybug let's just start right there
but uh
i think that the free to play is just
worse or pay to win is worse than
free-to-play but this is a pay-to-win
build so what do i know
um we'll we'll get i mean
two gold for two hp is acceptable i
think
we're kind of at like any port in the
storm levels
i'm sort of believing
that
we can't afford to roll a bat
if we're only gonna have four but the
unit is really good
it's like it's really really good i'll
take my stats for now
no come on i was just testing to see if
you were paying attention
um
i mean our stance are not good
and i'm i'm very skeptical about where
we stand here it is nice to kill one of
their their anchor units early that's
very helpful
we're actually going to win around many
people are saying this is not possible
guess what it just happened
you know i dude throw another llama in
here
this is the way
okay i love having a level three this
seems like decent value in a squad it's
gonna feed six three back somewhere
i don't know if this is worth it but
i i love that you're going to be what a
12 15 garlic armor
so bad
we really can't afford to keep you
around
a 5 6 that has no real upside
i'm sorry
we we
i know we only have one hp
we have to go with the the bison it has
to be done
you're only going to be a a 9 9
please if there is like a lord above we
could do this if we just draw or win
this round
it's not happening man you know as well
as i do with that skunk especially it's
not happening
it's ruthless i i'm not pivoting man i'm
not p i'm just give me
we gotta have a good pay to win build
okay i think this is okay
i think you can roll one threes man that
that that can win early rounds we're
gonna freeze a fish even though we're
likely like it's almost impossible to
get something better than that
um we'll be the this there will be the
awkward turtles
i know there's alliteration there but i
kind of feel like a turtle is one of the
one of the most awkward animals to begin
with you know
you know like am i not turtley enough
for the turtle club we lose these by the
way not unexpected
necessarily
toss me one of those
i think the the way you play this is a
freeze a buy and then like a honey and
we'll put it on a mosquito because it's
more likely to stick around because we
want our two fours to do something
like we we need the ladybugs to get some
upside we really need to win some early
rounds man like this is
the hedgehog is gonna like ruin my life
no it's not cause our bee we're gonna
we're gonna win
[Laughter]
early hedgehog's kind of funny
all right very a little lucky let's be
honest but
this is huge it the the effect of this
cannot be overstated give me a swan
because i love the econom economics of
it
toss me a hatching chick with the swan
now all of a sudden we got an eight nine
swan it's time to get a revenge quite
frankly
any this like free to play is gonna have
a very hard time standing up to an eight
nine swan because they don't have a
hatching chick
seven we win these
we win these
okay now like i'm i'm gonna make you pay
cause you've demoralized me over the
course of this video it's supposed to be
my game
uh you've demoralized me the time has
come okay
we haven't got me buffing you
sorry i'm going to slip into buffing you
is easy cause you're beautiful
you know what i'm talking about hey
okay
so you're gonna be a five seven actually
you're gonna be a 10 12. very nice
probably should have frozen but that's
okay what are we looking for
scaling we're looking for a good unit
basically that's exactly what we need to
see
we will sell our fish because it has no
upside we'll buy a dog
we won't even freeze the mosquito
because we're going to need some buy
cell space we love that
honestly i think we love this as well so
again i think we're positioned fairly
well considering it's round four we got
to do some heavy spins to get our dog
caught up uh they have a dodo cascade
huh
um but to what ends
to no end okay
finally finally dude i'm
i don't know if you can play this game
emotionally and have it have an impact
but that's what i'm doing right now so
mosquito you're not along for this world
thank you so much for playing though um
welcome
now a caterpillar would be a great fit i
think you can
i think and the best time to do it is
right away that means we're gonna sell
our ladybug we're gonna roll a swan
position one probably with garlic
instead of meat
we're looking for things to buy that
have uh
upside on cell
pig is one of them
caterpillar i mean there's a temptation
to roll two caterpillars don't get me
wrong
freeze me roll me
honestly freeze me
buy me
buy me a little owl man to sell for next
time
i think this is good buy sell meta
we need a permanent scaler and that's
our dog for our caterpillar to play off
of they've got a puppy that did not
scale
wow we basically could not have gotten
luckier
we take those we take those
that takes us four wins some honor has
been restored what a world now you get
sold
it's act at this point it's probably
more important that you get the garlic
that's obviously a gimme um
buy me
sell me puts me on five which is the
magic number
if we're okay with a buy sell and i
think i'm okay with a buy sell
like we'll freeze you for a second we
don't really need to apply you right
away so let's do a buy
a cell
and then
honestly you know what i'm gonna i'm
gonna put you out there instead of a bat
a bat's kind of it's more of a long-term
solution i'm gonna unfreeze it for the
time being 11 14 dog with garlic armor
okay now i'm now i'm starting to become
a bit of a believer here
we are gonna trade we we probably lose
this one
i don't see it well you know what we
actually don't
five eight oh no we actually draw okay
i got a couple of them wrong there five
eight caterpillar coming in clutch doing
some real work this you love to see this
so you start here
we i didn't think that was a full
combined i'm just gonna be honest with
you
genuinely
we definitely buy
feed the dog because it makes the
caterpillar stronger sell
buy
combine
is very interesting if we can get a
turtle but we can wait
i'll be honest with you man i'll be
honest with you
i think you freeze this
i think you can buy me
i think you can sell me
i think for the time being you can roll
two swans i'm feeling somewhat
optimistic here until we get into
scorpion territory where we have to
rework the whole dang squad but
this for now i'm not too upset with this
we got very lucky with the order things
went there we love it we love it level
one level one bus does not frighten me
your dog perishes
my two swans trade with your one swan we
very much win at the end here okay now
i'm feeling better
we know we're gonna run a combine
poodle
not not with this squad
the caterpillar doesn't earn its buffs
the swan it doesn't matter like we want
to make sure it goes to the dog the
hatching chick we don't want to take a
buff it is nice of the poodle buffs
itself but
for now this is a roll me
you could think about rolling a buffalo
selling a hatching chick rolling a
buffalo instead we've still got this
like buy sell available
it'll it'll pay for itself pretty soon
especially with a level 2 swan
now at ten
buy sell
eight buy
sell six
roll okay
you're gonna hate this
buy me
sell me buy me
sell me
roll me now we're at five
buy me
sell me
roll your best animal
which is you
it's not great
but i don't
think it's that bad
no it's kind of bad
it's bad enough
that's fine this is honestly i mean this
is a very similar team here the smooth
botox
they got double swans as well they got
swan players too holy birsh
so you gotta go
thanks for playing though
you gotta get bought
for now we still feed our dog
you're gonna get sold
you're gonna get bought we need garlic
on our bison like our bison has already
gotten much better
holy crap
four this is so stupid i love it
sell me
buy me
buff me like this shop you cannot do
better than this luck
roll a hatching chick for now
freeze the dog for next turn
like this is a nasty squad man
this buffalo has come way up
they got their own nasty squad here very
like you know double digits on everybody
turns out it's probably not going to
matter that much just because we're
freaking cracked but
that's good stuff what are we at we're
at six now six wins
six
it's sad that that's respectable in the
modern era but so be it now you gotta go
thanks for playing though i genuinely
had a great time having you on the show
thank you so much
octopus not yet
the time is not right
now you go for for four
this is not smart but watch
you get a nice buff you pay one for the
pill we get another buff
we sell you back
we get gold
it's not that valuable but
honestly i don't think you roll a bison
here
like i think we've we've got units that
we're already very pleased with
don't combine though and you know what
no no you we want the double effect of
the gold um
the most important thing for us is
honestly just garlic garlic on our bison
then get melon on the dog
because otherwise this can happen
you can call me crazy on this one i feel
like we're actually totally fine
it just they they went through so much
setup to get their dogs strong whereas
we didn't have to
so that takes us to seven it was there's
a very cute squad and i don't mean that
in a derisive way
but it's it's not gonna be good enough
to get the job done there
okay that's fine
you can definitely freeze a hatching
chick to use later
we really want to see garlic man
like that that's a really really
important get
if it doesn't show up it doesn't show up
it's that simple instead you just roll a
hatching chick this time honestly i'm
going to toss it behind my
my uh
buffalo i think it's going to be more
valuable there
we're ahead of the curve on scaling like
this it's a it's a pretty nice situation
honestly
we shouldn't be sweating it much
bus like legit kind of annoying but
doesn't matter
it's happening it's happening
eight wins please
sell me
buy me
it's nice having a a buffalo
and a dog huh who would have thought
this is exactly what we've asked for
holy crap freeze me we have we have room
to play with so we're no longer going to
be doing much buying and selling
although if we do it'll probably be the
swan
which is actually totally fine
you don't we don't need another one of
you honestly
in fact the t-rex probably doesn't have
to stick around forever the swan is is
getting us like a free buy every turn
which is just
outrageous okay double snake pretty
annoying but it couldn't have gone
better couldn't have gone better
dude i mean we might not stick around
too much longer like we've restored a
little bit of honor here it just took
the greatest run i've ever had in my
life or whatever so you need garlic
honestly let's give this t-rex a little
juice
and you know i'd love to give them a
little squeeze
freeze that for the future
we're pretty much stuck in rolls now
freeze that for a potential future okay
round 13 we got a squad that's quite
robust
very similar looking squads here can't
help but notice
we do fine we actually lose this exactly
which is a little annoying but then we
win we went on the back channel okay
dude i'm thank god because i was
starting to lose confidence in myself i
was starting to think i didn't know what
was happening in this game we finally
hit the click
we're ready to go thanks for watching
hope you enjoyed it thanks for all the
support on super auto pets
i'm sorry i had to resort to resin for
10 wins but sometimes you got to do what
you got to do
click the like button if you enjoyed the
episode and i'll see you next time see
ya



hey everybody we recovered some of our
honor in the last episode welcome back
it was going really bad and then um it
went better we had a great run to finish
it off not exactly the most you know we
didn't turn the meta on its head or
whatever but still um let me tell you
there is a uh a big super auto pets
update today let me give you the patch
notes
give me a moment here
i have it up okay
added sound and audio control unrollable
animals can now appear in the
achievement list i don't really know
what that means
i guess like um bees and spawned
crickets and rams
abandoning too many games d wards you
with an abandoned hat and abandoned hat
players only play against other
abandoned hats honestly about to be like
a cage match with a steel chair
it's just going to be non-stop uh
abandoned cues like i love the idea that
you have to play harder players when you
abandon too much like oh you you thought
it was fun to quit until you got like
ant fish mosquito well guess what now
you're only going up against ant fish
mosquito now this is the big one
you start at
ten lives on tier one you lose one life
per loss on tier two you lose two on
tier three you lose three
so it's i think it's going to be a
little bit of an adjustment period but
that's fine i also think that what that
means is that scaling has more of a
chance to work
um like you can in particular like a
duck might benefit from this because you
can lose early lose one tenth of your
life who cares if it lets you do better
in the mid game
for now though i don't think it changes
this
and i don't think it changes this too
much if anything the beaver is probably
better because we have a little bit more
room to scale um you can auto pick your
name now for some reason but uh
oh unwashed legs
i deserve to be cursed i deserve to be
cursed i had the unwashed legs the the
ultimate me team name and i and i opted
against it what's what's wrong with me
man we draw these hey tony tony tony
what's up hot dog um
okay so you know what i mean i think we
have an obligation
to
your
a 2-1 ant dies the same as a 3-2 ant in
most situations
but it can kill a slightly stronger unit
that's true but for now i'd rather have
a 2-3
give me this to a 3-2 and then you know
what freeze me a duck
i was not being facetious i think that
this could actually make an impact for
us
i think that that if you think you're
what the heck is this man
ants and bees ants and bees gonna get me
some ants and bees i think we
certainly lose this but that's fine we
lose one because we're still on tier one
we go down to nine hp
it's gonna it's gonna blow up the meta i
think it's gonna like i actually think
it's a really positive change
um i think it's gonna enable
holy burst
i think you could you could play a 2-4
giraffe maybe
roll me once
sell me because the swan is freaking
sweet man and a 4-5 swan is getting even
sweeter
well think about probably next turn you
you could try a dodo
we want to buff our swan because it's
the most likely unit to stick around now
we're in double damage territory we'll
take two if we lose rounds but still i i
think that this is going to be a
positive change for the game
because some of the animals that i
really placed poorly on our uh on our
tier list are actually going to be a
little bit more viable now
like a leopard with time to scale time
to get to level two time to put a tiger
behind it all of a sudden could be like
it could be kind of a bop honestly
so i think we sell our beaver
and then we basically just take a chance
if this hits the
all right well it didn't so we could
have taken the ant to level two instead
you know what though i'm not feeling too
stupid about it let's put our uh goose
up at the freaking front and let's get
this dodo uh buffed and i'm okay rolling
the four squad marty
it's a great time to be able to freeze
the snail quite frankly i'll add an
otter and well well
i think the otter really its efficacy is
mostly provided early but so we got a
9-7 goose up at the front wait no no no
we got a 13 7 goose up at the front
i think we probably lose this double
dodo dodo cascade is a new meta
um
it's uh it works similar to crab you
pass a bunch of attack forward i did
weirdly enough it's not actually why we
lost that one we just you know their
their dodos were pretty stacked quite
frankly
roll me okay we need kind of like um
we need a next level meta let's put it
that way so we know the snail's not long
for this world all of our other stats
are pretty good even the giraffe i think
you
freeze a pill
roll
okay frieza swan
the giraffe i'm not i mean i'll freeze
it but i'm not totally sold
i'm actually really dumb
i meant to pill to kill you and then
give you permanent melon armor the truth
of the matter is that it's still totally
fine we'll just do it next turn instead
and now that we got tier threes these
these lives really matter because we're
like uh
these rounds really matter
because we're taking three damage per
yeah
this is scary man two level two horses
everything i've said about horses you
know you got me ashamed of my words and
my deets look at this we're actually
gonna lose the horses that's gonna take
us to i don't even know like four hp
whatever i'm used to it so basically we
we can't lose yet we got two losses to
go until things get really
until we lose for real so i don't think
we're gonna invest in a giraffe but i do
think we can at least freeze a turtle
i wouldn't mind adding a level 2 turtle
into this
and then not you know what i would still
roll a pill if we if we got a level two
turtle quickly
i don't love any of this
i don't know what we're fishing for
which is part of the problem
just something i like i guess okay now
that that seems like the kind of thing
that could really turn the game on its
head um
i feel like you might be able to make a
kangaroo work here but i'm gonna roll
i don't see a fish man i just i just
don't see it working which means we
should probably dump it but for round
six we're not doing too bad honestly
like i i know we're losing but the the
squad is actually okay
we don't have any long-term scaling
which is the real problem but we're
definitely going to wipe this team
that wasn't a problem we we definitely
can get rid of fish and giraffe
could you with a swan so close to
leveling up do you think it's possible
right now you could dump a fish
buy a worm
we're on round seven
i would say let's i mean garlic is
pretty good let's add garlic we get a
plus one plus one out of it
a bunny is really nice a swan is great
scaling okay
then sell me
by me
this worm now becomes like what we pin
our hopes and dreams on and that's okay
honestly that's okay
remember that the dodo still only pushes
forward one so for now i like this
i think we'll keep an apple around an
apple with a worm is basically a pear
although a pair would be a pair plus an
apple so you know what i mean
okay dear like it crushes melon armor
ah but only once we have it so there's
that
um this is this is pretty bad
never mind it's totally fine we win
these
okay that takes us to three wins
technically six lives lost but
that's okay
i think i think we do a double feed here
real quick
because i'm not attached to our squad i
definitely think you could roll a can
um but i'd like to
fish for something a little better like
you i i recognizing fully like we're
spending a lot on rolls here
i'd rather give you plus two plus two
than plus one plus one we'll get that
next time we probably will not roll a
can then and we we should be moving this
is just a genuine misplay we should be
moving the worm up in our uh in our
power rankings here a little bit the
math just works here i'm feeling okay
i'm feeling okay
we still got our strongest unit back
here nothing could go wrong it would
have to be a ram and it would have to be
like a ram with a horse attached to it
that takes us to four
and we're not on lethal we're minimum
two away from lethal so let's this time
do this let's this time do this the
squirrel is just in my opinion
unplayable the dodo is a sometimes food
we're gonna we're gonna add it later
none of these appeal to me i would i
would oh i was gonna say i'll take a
chance on a salad but no it's not
necessary give me one of these now you
go here you go here you're gonna get
sold for a snake in the future
i know here's the thing
you know what i i disagree with myself
for like two more rounds i think you let
the worm simmer on garlic maybe you move
the worm to the front
um
but i'm i'm actually actually absolutely
okay with this
um
although i do think
we do lose this one it's just a very
well placed melon armor against the team
that was pretty good
okay
i think now let's make a shrewd decision
the turtle is not doing anything the the
melon armor is doing everything um let's
get this going
although now we got to figure out where
we would want our snake to be which is
fair
i guess you would want it behind this
it's a good point you really want it
behind the worm but it's it's hard to
get that going i guess you let's put it
behind the swan for now
it's not ideal
we keep leveling up our dodo because
essentially a level on our dodo
is kind of like we're just waiting for a
rooster to come around
and if a rooster does come around
then uh
we'll be very stoked our dodo's level
two or level three
i have no idea how this is gonna go
i i hate to see a strong unit with melon
armor but it's okay we got our own
strong unit here
i don't know if it's strong enough
this is a very uh
very common sort of squad we're running
into here we lived through that which is
awesome we still need to do 15 damage to
you here okay okay smack them let's go
that was that's pretty close like we
don't have the dream squad but but five
wins here feels pretty good
and we're living longer it's round 11
like things are getting a little hot hit
my worm please you peace hit my worm
please you peace
it happens
i'm not pleased with it happening but it
happens
um
basically you want to get your snake
leveled up but we also need so much more
like food like i i do think that you can
probably sell your swan here though it
pains me
freeze a chocolate i just wanted to see
like real
meat but um that's okay for now
i'm just gonna add to my worm but i'm
i'm pessimistic i think we got some we
got low sushi rolls there we got um i
mean the the cat is worse than the swan
right now but that uh you know can
change hold on dude we i think we lucked
out here this we we should not have been
as clean
as we are like that the roles in the
shop did us really dirty but at least we
got six
so there's some you know honor has been
restored to some degree
i guess we're going to invest in this
worm it's it's a pretty important part
of our overall
you know ecosystem here um
of these you know you would hope to hit
the worm one day it'll happen we we
might be reaching a point where a
scorpion could possibly survive through
two attacks
not not this time
oh i like the build that they got here
though the the scorpion like mid game
tech
that's okay though look at this our dodo
is doing some work in its own right that
takes us to seven
i'll i'm willing to admit that some of
that seven is probably coming from
strength of schedule but
now i think you
accept that
a snake getting an extra life can be of
extreme importance
to be honest the worm needs melon armor
now
and if we're just gonna buy nothing we
might as well
be i'm too attached to the big scorpion
man i i we shouldn't we should lose soon
quite frankly but
a fly dog build
my my only two cents on this right now
is i i kind of feel like
they're trying to have their cake and
eat it too
like i'm not saying it won't work
because the the dog you know is pretty
strong
i don't think it's gonna work though
um you they kind of were straddling two
archetypes there i bet their hand was
forced like they they saw the fly late
and were like i have to take it which is
fair
it's really good
might as well keep the the worm chunk in
here
i'm not gonna say you know like if it
ain't broke don't fix it yeah if we got
in the leopard a little earlier i would
love to give it a try but
okay i mean you i think you can think
about a rooster for certain
got a 38-38 here i mean the the cat is
an unsung hero right now i i think we've
gotten a little lucky just to be alive
but i'll take it uh interesting skunk
what an interesting skunk you got there
i am not a full believer in skunk meta
but i certainly find the concept of it
very interesting um i would love to see
it work because it's a little weird
throw me a snake unfreeze me we really
want chocolate more than anything else i
i think for sure i shouldn't have rolled
through my tiger last time please roll
me into snake or chocolate
okay
one day a random food will hit our worm
and then it is going to be a dream come
true round 16.
all right so immediately
we we basically are playing a squad that
counters our own and and we'll lose
but
straight up
nine wins that's not so bad for a first
try in this new meta
it gives you a snapshot of your team
when you lose too that's better for
screenshots for sure
unless your face is in the middle like
mine is right now
well i do not dislike this
holy birch
i'll take an otter on turn two
be the inedible mouths isn't it ironic
they could eat everything except
themselves
don't hit my ants
that's a first
new patch notes your aunt is not
guaranteed to get hit the lazy piece is
so good
all right so first loss you don't sweat
that anymore because it's not 25 of your
life gone
we pretty much have to do the combine
here so that we don't you know
split the defense
i would rather have two ants definitely
freeze this though this is a good four
squad marty what we don't want to see is
two mosquitoes or one mosquito
all right there's three mosquitoes
you can't make this stuff up
i think we draw though but again like a
loss now it's still so early it's only
my second game on the patch a loss now
seems so much less catastrophic right
because you're like oh instead of losing
50 of my hp we will buy this
you know or the 25 of my hp i'm losing
like you know
less
so i'm gonna try something a little
funky here i i'm you have my word
i will try to make a hedgehog blowfish
run work just because it's fun
maybe with more life it's actually
possible to get it to pop i don't know
that that's the case but
hey we stopped the bleeding here
one win one loss
you could totally
i actually think you could fit a dog on
this build the dog could just be like
your tanky unit which would mean you
probably sell your otter
buy a dog pill the ant hope it hits the
dog
that's the worst thing it could hit for
sure but that's okay now get we want to
see you get three hp as soon as possible
because that'll let you live through the
hedgehog and we can change our
positioning as a result
i don't want to roll an elephant here i
think it's counter-intuitive
but i think an elephant is kind of a a
baddie for us even though it could
trigger more blowfish hits
i think we'll you know buy sell a
mosquito three hp please okay thank you
buy a dodo and just stick it up here
stick it up here yeah as they say um
so you could if you were confident you
could roll a hedgehog at the front here
because everything would live and it
might kill things on your opponent's
team
i'm just gonna level with you i think
this is very stupid and that's why i'm
going to do it
we got lives to play with we only we
would go down to six now we go down to
seven if we lost this round i do see
that we're going up against some enemies
that have less than two hp i'm not sure
it's going to work out for us in the
long term but if my blowfish hits your
horse
hey hands off my hiney baby
what is going on
okay this
this seems like it's gone terribly wrong
they summoned things that got great
value out of that but okay we got to try
we got to try because it's fun it's like
it's just fun man
okay you want a camel
i think you want an ox too
so which would mean at some point we got
to like dump our fish well the dodo goes
first because it's a 1-3 but the camel
when it gets hit will buff the unit
behind it so i definitely think that you
can roll
a
camel that gets hit by your hedgehog and
buffs your blowfish i also feel like if
you can
this is so dumb i i love it
um
because i want an ox because an ox
sorry fish could not connect to the
server
an ox behind the
hedgehog means we'll get hit but then
get melon armor
and then freeze a pill because it works
well with ox we would freeze we would
probably pill like the camel right now i
guess
i actually sort of feel like
no you can't do that
[Laughter]
you pill a camel and then buy a camel i
don't know actually i look
please please please
this gives us melon armor and a nice
buff
which makes the hedgehog less dangerous
thank you well hold on give me one of
these now it's new tech cause check it
out
we got a camel with the same stats
although it's further away from where
we'd like it to be overall i don't know
man maybe you put the dog in the front
here and then like let's let's give this
a try this is dumb but i i really i'm so
like pot committed to making this build
work at some point just because it's
insane okay their build like directly
counters ours
because their their camel and uh
kangaroo are gonna be oh unless our
blowfish don't hit the camel let's go
that's huge that's huge
that's huge
we still uh we still lose this no we
draw thank god thank god okay keep it
going keep it going
there's something here man do we uh
garlic on our on our hedgehog or no
sorry garlic on our blowfish
get your hedgehog even stronger
i know that this is now bad for our dog
we should really replace the dog with
like a
another unit quite frankly but
we need to wait until we get like a tank
lord definitely love definitely love a
lot of this i i'm freezing everything i
don't know what i'm doing
i honestly two hedgehogs might have been
the play i think this kind of works with
a whale too okay this squad is actually
like not good for us
unless we shoot the the the uh that's
not what i wanted but you know what hold
on we do really well there we do really
well there we go okay okay hold on
yes
yes
roll once
i guess why not you know why not
again the dog does not have any real
reason to exist here we need camel
garlic another level on our camel will
be pretty sick too we also want our
hedgehog to level up just because it'd
be funny it would just be funny if that
happened
i don't know what the heck's going on
here
we
certainly lose
but
congrats like i we lost to a meta that
we popularized in a way so it doesn't
feel that bad quite frankly
level two one of these okay now how a
one-up on a hedgehog might be a play too
for our future
i'll be straight up but i don't know the
6'5 it's like it's kind of working
but
i'm also like what if we just peeled it
and then bought like an ant
come on man that's that's not gonna work
on the other hand
how much like we have four lives left
i don't know
maybe
i mean this is not
probably the way you would build if you
wanted to win 10 rounds but if you
wanted to really screw up somebody's
life
like really what we're doing at this
point is just go we're running like anti
to the meta
and having fun with it in that way and i
think that's worth something man
now we're going to lose this one
[Laughter]
which means they're gonna be on lethal
right we're gonna have one hp but hey
one hp is all you need to win
i can't imagine a snake would really fit
here
although but you know technically maybe
behind our ox could do something
um
there's something to be said about like
a badger right like what about a badger
that gets killed kills your hedgehog and
then no because then it i don't know man
it's like it's really
dumb on the other hand that's the fact
that it's dumb is kinda sick
we can can it first
it's it's not smart
you know what hold on what do we do like
this
no because then if we put the hedgehog
at the front okay it's gonna damage the
badger but not kill it but it will
remove the melon armor from your ox then
when the badger died it would kill your
ox so we have to do it in this order to
make the ox work
i would just to get one more win would
would feel like a blessing honestly
knowing how nasty this squad is and what
kind of hp they got going on
i'm not saying we did the right thing
because i think that that's not sensible
but
maybe we didn't do the wrongest thing
anyway we lost
but i had fun thanks for watching one
day that build is going to take the
world by storm if you enjoyed it click
the like button upset a great deal of
course subscribe you want to see more in
the future for now thanks for watching
i'll see you next time see you



games good games
sucks i beat krendor like twice early
i was down to one health like nine
rounds ago and then i just went out of
there
at least most of my losses were to the
person who lost i mean it's kind of like
the packers losing to the bucks and then
they yeah
nobody
dude i gotta put some respect on the the
scaling attacker game now
like when you got more hp to work with
those leopards can pop
all right let's do the same
game name if you guys are down for one
more
i think i'm gonna get out of my league
so i'm gonna duck out oh okay oh no
because i'm just getting annihilated in
10 minutes and then sitting here waiting
for 45 minutes
same name same name yes i'm in
apollo what's your what's your hot key
for
don't tell me who to play games with
uh
squad up
there you go
right now i'm doing reverse kegels right
now yeah i'm reversing i think i'm going
to change my underpants so
oh if you do a reverse kegel you get
banned
i think reverse reverse kegel i i feel
like i get like a toner right i get like
two inches taller when i do one
yeah it's when you're kegeling you're
tightening up but when you reverse it's
like you're getting the final drops of
urine out you know you're like you're
squeezing it all right
i'm with you there but there's like
potential for some magic in the future
okay yeah i got a round two play
i got a round two play
i i want you to know i had the choice
hot eggplants or hot cucumbers i took
hot cucumbers
i like it
i think a warm eggplant would have been
better
sorry chad eggplant is a funnier image
cucumber's a funnier word i agree and i
had these i had cheesy cucumbers but i
didn't want to do it because that
reminds me of what it's like in the
produce aisle after malf's mom goes to
the grocery store
my name after kfc
now
i did go panicking eggplanes
that's pretty good
oh my god
are you kidding me
we draw these i'll take a draw oof
horse horse unplayable
i mean
that's how can you defeat such a lineup
yeah some might say
some might say it's impossible
some might say four ants is just too
many
some might be wrong dude
is actually sick until you go up against
four mosquitoes
well i mean do you have four mosquitoes
no
then maybe
maybe
stinky
wait what did i do what the what what
what did i do what did i do
i had three of these [ __ ] you sound
like the guy from the three students
that runs around in a circle on the
floor
the enemies
come busting out of the wall
that's curly
oh because he's bald right i'm just
going to say guys it's turning anyway if
you're taking this long on turn two we
might have a problem what was the
the one stooge that came in that nobody
liked when the one went curly yeah
that's the one listen just listen to his
name
yeah yeah just said holy crap let's just
make fun of his first name
is it his real name what the hell is
this [ __ ] all the beat
my aunts buff the worst things let's go
rob your team's kind of crack there by
the way i didn't take down
that's not great
i'm sorry apollo but i'm not i mean it
wasn't really your fault it was more the
ants targeting every single thing for
like perfect nonsense
you know what i'm saying yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah i know it's dude i
oh good that's the second time that i've
upgraded tier three and i've gotten a
snail that's neat
couldn't connect to the server
no don't i need i need everything in my
shop right now don't desync me
nice
uh yeah
you're right there mel oh yeah
do i want to do that
i kind of do dude

spicy tomatoes why would i all natty
all natty that's crazy let's go ahead
and take something that sucks and just
make it hey a little spice is very nice
you know what's crazy is that spiciness
is like the only flavor you taste going
in and going out like imagine if you ate
a cupcake and then like 12 hours later
and you
felt sweet you're like oh that's
it's so sweet how does it feel sweet
you know it's like a sugary coating or
something yeah i could like just imagine
though
ryan's already got oh
you have like a 6'5 what are you ryan's
already got a what yeah and i that's all
natty i don't wear armor
down goes coach this is a terrible round
that was i am so happy with your great

yeah yeah
yeah save it dude i think we go let's
see take a look
or if you ate like a warhead and then

i am
i have drawn so many of these games i
can't believe that [ __ ] worked dude
my plans are panicking
oh boy oh it was like the dumbest thing
i've ever done in that one that's
awesome dude that's [ __ ] awesome

have honestly
i've built the perfect losing team
[ __ ] it man dude hear me out wait this
gets even better wait stop i know you
guys are like no stop don't do that but
i'm doing it all right so we're going to
do that he's doing it and then we're
going to do that
and then we're going to do
that
this is dumb
oh you want to talk about new meta we
got your new medal right here dude you
got your new medal right here
i gotta go crab for panicking i got a
little new meta oh boy it's rub
kind of freaking bad oh crinder yeah
here we go i'm eating them for breakfast
here we go oh the all the melons back
he's got the he's got the melon man
that's a hot kangaroo oh no that was not
a good draw i can't debate this guy's
got a hot kangaroo that's gonna that's
gonna drop
anyone who hones their last unit is an
actual coward i literally honeyed it on
the second turn because i had i couldn't
roll and it was the only thing left i
was like it's like the biggest bm you
could possibly imagine you know what
guess what um it saved me so uh eat my
shorts your music savior
thank you
oh
oh [ __ ] do i have pivot i think i might
have pivot holy [ __ ]
i think we're done certainly
we shall do this
yeah yeah we're done with this
this is big oh that's
that's i think i play best on one life
it might be good that leopard build was
pissing me off
that's what i'm saying
it all comes together no i haven't seen
his build yet
okay
uh i actually think this is right froze
the whole damn shop
[ __ ] it
i don't know man
flying you guys don't understand
that's fine i wouldn't expect you to
honestly and that's okay you insulting
your chat
well i had two i got bought a cow and i
have two units that scale on their own
and another unit that i have to keep
that doesn't scale so i gave the milk to
the unit that i have to keep that
doesn't scale so they could be stronger
oh you guys got scaling huh that sounds
nice this guy's got a cow man
tier five he's got a cow
rob do you still do you still have a
badger
um i don't know he has three now
[Laughter]
sell everything is apollo taking forever
again
i had a complicated turn all right oh
sure sure
all right here we go
dirty red i'm a badger grinder what the
frick what's going on over there
uh we're just believing in a dream
all right he's got a great day rob
believe it in a dream
oh come on that sucks and is bad
that's a pog team
damn he would love me and two rams
i hate it
baby
oh i love it oh i love that
i love that
oh what
[ __ ] you and the dog you rode in on
hmm i can't believe we got it not even a
single one of these [ __ ]
a little scared a little scared about
what's been happening here
any anybody out yet
no no no no no
crane doors on one
i've been on one but i'm going to buy
i'm scaling i'm on two
i'm not four
this is risky but i have to do it
yeah there we go
save that's the ticket right there right
there
ah
i mean i got lives i got lives rob you
can't even say that you're the jets in
the scenario because you're in first
place you've got four lives left
yeah i know i'm like i'm thinking about
risky strats and i don't know what's
going on but i think we'll we'll go
sheesh
gonna just give someone a little beep
beep this turn
you bought a deer you don't have to
censor it
but a deer
the frick give me something good to eat
very nice ambient noise
yeah in the lobby
oh okay it's crandor all right here we
go gamer moments wow
so clever a crocodile yeah
robert
[Laughter]
oh
wait
nope
actual piece of trash that's twice
it was pretty close
i do have to consider
and so on level one everything pretty
happy about that
jesus
definitely a lot of options here this
doesn't make any sense
do we want any of this
i don't think we want any of this
hmm
dude these games are so much hotter than
like the main lobbies like it's crazy
yeah it's tough man
i don't know i don't know i don't know
it's like playing in your division
because you start building the beat the
themes in your divisions you're like
dude i gotta counter them
but then you get countered by like the
shitty people knives
like cindy
fine i'll do it heyo
i'm also gonna say fine dude
fine
i did it
i don't know man i don't know if i can
survive this then you're all in big
trouble i think i'm just i think i'm
just out
losing to rob twice
um
just bad the shops have not had good
food man i have only one hair one pair
now if you a bosch or a bartlett guy
what the frick you just say to me green
pear or the brown pear oh i don't give a
freak any pear
i don't i'm bad with pear names apple
names
all i know is i prefer pears to apples
same i agree
apples actually shred my digestive
system
and uh canned pears are like the best so
good
so good they slide that you break them
up with your tongue you don't even need
to chew you could literally just swallow
that canned pears then on the way out
it's you get a second dose
you get a sugary sweet butthole
personally i like red pears
oh
right i've ever read
they're good i used to be like oh red
pears and i got a red pair and i was
like dude this is amazing robert
oh okay
worm dude my worm is pretty cracked but
you did break my melon armor like a
piece
unbelievable rob
oh
i got him
that's like that's like the only thing i
could have run into at that time that i
would have lost to
okay okay well
uh martin lawrence from bad boys [ __ ]
just got real
all right intern and go pee
is rob here rob just left rob oh sorry
sorry i was talking i was muted i
apologize
i apologize
i just want to make sure you heard me
insult you
yeah no i did okay good
now we're [ __ ] talking
yeah although
maybe i could
although maybe i could
look at this guy look he's so powerful
he looks he looks like he's from
spaceballs man

really good in the in the 4 hp game for
sure
oh man i kind of wanna
okay

only comment i've read in the last 10
minutes is about peppers
not in-game peppers but carolina reaper
peppers
i wish i had peppers
oh frick this that's a rob can i ask you
what your what your plan is with that
right food
uh my excuse me
you're right
in the store
my oh the yeah i'm not sure yet to be
honest okay have any of you ever had
like uh like super hot pepper
yeah
no
yes
what does badger do on level up by the
way
double its damage to it doubles the
damage that it does the retaliatory
damage
is a habanero
you know i'm i'm probably right there
with you honestly that's about as hot as
i enjoy it
yeah it's like after that like it's just
it's too much
it's just pain i did the one chip
challenge but it's like
it's spicy
but actually the worst part is the taste
it tastes like you're eating like a
piece of cancer or something
no it's really bad tasting it's just
like a good endorsement
dude that's it's made by uh paqui right
yeah they did they do the spicy like
doritos yeah i've had their little oh
they do haunted ghost pepper ones and
they were just like too hot to be
enjoyable like yeah
oh rob oh [ __ ] fly
turkey fly turkey nonsense i always say
i may not be a top 1000 streamer but i
have had two endoscopies
and i don't think many uh other top
streamers
well most top streamers probably almost
everybody in the top 100 can't even
spell endoscopy so
that's true i've only had one so i'm not
at granddaughter's level yeah
you need a couple more years there yeah
i'll be getting colonoscopies at that
point
there's only so many other holes for
them to explore
that's yeah that really is about
[Laughter]
it right all right all right
all right check this off
oh
i'm laughing people are like backseating
apollo in my chat
yeah
i'm like it's not even either do you see
this dog in the bottom right corner
i don't have any control over this
dang old fly build man
thank god i gave them [ __ ] health
dude or that snake would have ate in my
ass yeah the snake snake is is is kind
of anti-anti-fly
level three bus get a pog
yo
okay it's looking
it's not looking good robert not looking
i think it's looking pretty good if you
had level two hippo it probably i died
yeah yeah
this is a win oh rob
what's up baby
what did you upgrade to rack attack i uh
i don't remember i i sold some [ __ ] and
i i had a couple of dragon plays on the
last one
so
yeah
dragon's good man
and so is badger with the honeybee
how do you feel about one more with the
same name
but we need a gentleman's agreement
which is like one minute shops
that's fine all right i've been doing
more shops personally
look the dragon takes some time all
right
but yeah sure okay as the same it has
the same info
i literally just buy and wait
i don't make too many decisions i mean i
don't expect everybody to have 200 hours
in the game and like
instantly analyze
the game but you can't seem to
that's because it's all in the in ranked
this is private matches the met is
completely different
it's it's nobody sees how [ __ ] this is
man you know how different the meta is
is so different
he's right i'm rolling one of these
yep son of a [ __ ] well good luck have
fun everyone yeah like we lose round one
except coach
except it's invicta
i don't know this is name combo it's
it's sam i'm you know i'm liking i'm
liking my name combo mine's okay but
mine's pretty good it doesn't gross me
out you know mine's true to life man
so if as long as you're talking about
gross stuff because you guys are like
obsessed with it yeah dude
this isn't like a genuinely like honest
question

a what a shower
as opposed to a grower yes um i'm a
grower i do not show isn't everybody a
grower that's just like what it does
yeah well yeah
you would think yeah everybody would
have that like who's like
like thing and then it like goes to like
five inches like it doesn't make sense
it doesn't make any sense he's already
it doesn't really make a lot of sense i
won't lie to you about that
cause if you're showing you're you're
gonna grow anyway
many people are saying this
oh

small penis

he's doing his best
okay he may look familiar but i implore
you to give him a more uh scrutinous
view
so when i lose to ryan's
fifth position
yeah i doubt that's gonna happen you
might lose to position one two three
position four it's not it's not looking
so hot
what did you do position five let's just
say it's a unit that is uh priceless
well i guess i'm gonna see it i mean

about three seconds
oh boy oh drops
oh boy it's gonna be already hello

position uh it was a spawned ram
what it rearranged my positions
a spawn ring indeed to rearrange my
positions it always does that yeah it
sucks man um
i get in turn and it shuffled my squad
i hope i go up against that changes
everything man

behind it

duck won't have melon armor anymore

dude
ryan got that thick scaling early on
dude dolphin is opie
dolphin's good i like dolphin
i
i got monkey bison but it was too late
it's already over that's not upgrade
when leveling
okay okay okay
no no
no and no
and i'm angrily in my turn in goopy
that's the second p you've gone to in
the last 20 minutes
it's an impressive amount of urine
i mean i go pee a lot but like
and you see just drinking a lot do you
think so
like
water g-fuel he does could be a lot of
fuel fuel yeah uh yep that'll do it
that's that's that's what gets you yeah
i hope he ended his turn first
oh lordy the worst sound 2021 contender
just logged on sorry sorry apologies
apologies
didn't they say g-fuel has like metal in
it or something it did have more than
trace elements of lead apparently
good yeah it's one of the it well you
know what people say it's one of the
worst elements but uranium would
definitely be worse you know plutonium
any of the eoms
einsteinium that would i don't even know
if that one can exist on earth for like
potassium potassium wouldn't it just
your [ __ ] would be on fire
i have not played ryan
oh i'm playing ryan again frick this is
playing ryan right now and i haven't
played it since round one it's it's
actually my sixth snail in a row i'm out
of a spider again
i'm winning so i don't mean to be
like acting like it's terrible but
there's you got a super dog i mean i
can't i can't beat that man there's like
seven things that he could spit out and
it spit out six snails in a row
i gotta fight the same person twice
take down
dumb dog
hmm
this is a terrible shot
it's got a beaver and a squirrel dude
that doesn't help
i'm bowing dude i can't hit the dang
units yeah i'm not i'm not living past
this turn
i just haven't been able to scale my my
big guy so he's a little guy
i want to see all these wacky teams that
ryan's coming up with and i haven't seen
him since the first round oh
you're you're done
you're in
i don't know dog i don't know dog
your name is dog dog i don't know is the
thing
you know
yeah i know i get it
no i don't
i've committed to it maybe a bad
decision we'll see
there's one
well
well if i lived through this round
i will have not died i hope you don't
have any builds based off of low hp
units that would be a shame
i don't go up against clifford again oh
i finally get to ryan let's see what
he's got hope i don't jack off oh
you oh great it's ryan again
bye bye i might still lose i think you
are going to lose yeah here comes my
snail oh this nail
you just have like 50 words i have so
many stats
oh i can't do anything against why have
i fought ryan three times in a row you
thought that was my ghost that time
oh well it doesn't matter i've freaking
lost to you three times in a row so well
you know my team is really good in my
defense
you you know i just haven't been able to
scale my hippo that's all just pivot
you know what
it might
this might
be our only solution
[ __ ]
did you see that youtube is removing the
dislike counter i'm so paul what did
they really
yeah they're leaving the button believe
but they're taking out the
uh actual counter because they don't
want targeted harassment no one
mentioned of course that the most
disliked video of all time is the
youtube rewind of 2018
there's also
the sir toasty edit of uh deepest
chamber that we did that one time
remember toasty
so i just it's not too soon it's been
long enough we can laugh about it we can
laugh about it
i've ended my turn that's all i'll say
do what if just for fun i'm into my turn
i'm ready to lose we sent out like a
25-2 scorpion out there just
that would be pretty strong
i don't know man
you guys ever see the vine well i mean
it's a tick-tock of those two little
kids
powering up and then they run up to a
brick wall and do a backflip backflip
off it and then go into like an anime
pose
no but that sounds pretty fun nope wow
you're actually a piece not yet
i mean i i still lose don't worry about
it dude i'm getting palm ryan's got
clifford rob's got monty python that's
true i do have multiple i thought
oh i love that i love the shop is sucked
forward you didn't want a tiger kangaroo
huh
my kangaroo gets to attack like twice
that's not gonna buff up nearly enough
to do anything
i'm in a world of hurt i was gaming
i hate that ryan's going to win the last
game of the day yeah that might not be
true i like it looks great right now
he's sandbagging pieces it looks really
good right now but
oh yeah that would be pretty nice holy
it doesn't exist
it doesn't exist it doesn't exist
oh whoops sorry i didn't believe it's my
only chance and i can't roll it
unreal you know what
let's try it
do i want to do this too i think i do
you know what i do
i tried i tried my best minus 10.
all right granddoor died
i mean i did rounds ago
you
son of a
i i lose you guys would get so mad and
then you don't look at the screen and go
oh wait never mind i'm 800 times
stronger than you oh
oh good luck my friend you beat me

that's a snakeless clone too
yeah i got rid of the snake
you got rid of it yeah i pivoted away
from the stake i don't know frick man uh
do you think i need snakes in this house
top three
that's a win that's a that's a technical
auto battle or win
it depends which one
no well auto battler doesn't just go top
50 bottom 50.
uh
wait bottom 50.
percent what up
i kind of want to do it are you talking
about man
i want to do it
you know you want it right do it dude
please
one of those is that what you wanted to
see oh yeah
that's that's mouth i've learned
anti-scorpion technology from
from that that isn't even like a thing
that's just
yeah but this is just this is just melon
armor this is just long
melon armor with a little tongue
sticking out of it
i i don't even run it that often but i
knew i was gonna go up against uh
some some some sweaty tanks so
i had to
who needs the lemnis gate
oh gee me
how did you get your dog so beefy do you
just like you were having at it early on
in the first
two rounds i rolled five ducks
and then i sold all of my ducks to feed
this dodo so it became like disgusting
apollo what did you end up doing with
like all thousands of your otters at the
start
i sold them i know but where did all
that hp go

tried to get it on the one unit oh my
god you're a [ __ ]
oh rob oh man
two hp remains i'm not sweating it i'm
sweating it a little
but i don't know how to oh man
down to the best of three three game
series
yeah
i don't know how to improve is the
problem it could be ties though
also true that one happened
or what do you have leading this victory
here
uh i mean it can go either way you've
got one side that's just uh extremely
tanky with other var variety of animals
they've chosen but the other side's
really just bringing it together with a
variety of dog
dog
[Laughter]
yeah
i want to consider it
okay
you just really don't see enough dogs in
play
it's true
oh
ryan with the risky
oh he's throwing punches
rob i hope you win

farm-based animals you better watch out
that's come all over us i
also have farm-based animals
would you consider mosquitoes farm-based
no also an otter is not a farm animal
either i don't know why i said that it
is if you work on a fish farm i mean you
are well
fished so i guess the answer is yes then
i just killed our everywhere anybody out
there rolling three ants right now
no
because that would be very nice for me
possibly
what do you got over there man what's
going on i'll just tell you straight up
i have three mosquitoes and two horses
oh god there they are jesus
they all split their shots too not for
me
granddaughter what the [ __ ] man
we're killing you oh yeah
you're fighting a clone you piece
[Laughter]
low-key legs i like that
none of this is good what do we do about
this
many people start with this
i had a gushing buttocks earlier it was
great
i like that
you like gushing buttocks
robotics
i don't want to do this yet though do i
shrimp it

oh okay
let's do that
this is gonna piss somebody
oh
no no no no oh no no no
oh no no no no
all right okay hear me out we're going
to do something weird
i this worked this worked [ __ ] damn
it turn
anybody else rolling a snail on their
squad or just me
i could be
say one thing
so what did they change about dodo now
that i have it on my board it doesn't
change um yeah yeah it only buffs one uh
animal ahead so when you level it up
like what levels up about it two doubles
the other thing that just makes the
animal ahead better oh
oh robert wait again starting again
me are we going again
look at this your board is just no board
yeah i know
this is a setup round
okay
oh let's go sorry rob
i mean you know i'm in a i'm in a tough
spot i'm going to be honest with you why
did you see my game i thought that was
finding ryan yeah
oh yeah yeah yeah you got a clone
do you think you really want a clone
um
i do know what you're talking about dude
i'm gonna i do know what you're talking
about
[ __ ] it
ah
that's the worst one we could have
gotten right there
um
crab i'm not gonna buy it though
[ __ ] it dude
it's coming together yeah this is gonna
be kind of a wacky one i think
oh i forgot about that
i got a ticking time bomb
[Laughter]
god i can't wait to peel this [ __ ]
dude
i need more context on that
uh well in five seconds i'm going to
start screaming so
he's going to oh he's got a turtle he's
going to pill oh you freaking no i don't
have a turtle oh it's an ant a level 2
an ant not an ant it's a flamingo
again we just played the third time in a
row dude this is my third match with
krendor yeah
we
we drew once i beat him i think it's his
turn to beat me
still living still live the meaty fish
oh
the back okay power overwhelming
protoss archon
is this starcraft it's a starcraft dude
is there a grudge
rush to you too as well sir
[Laughter]
some weak ass [ __ ] we rolling
i gotta like
oh my god okay
sometimes you hit the reroll button and
you just
everything's bad
oh dude do i do i buy that am i stupid
am i buying that
if you buy a squirrel can you freeze all
the food
if you you can yeah
um
i don't know what happens if you freeze
more than two
i think that it might pick two and give
you a full shot next time that's then
why why is squirrel in the game yeah no
it's like insanely bad take it out of
the game
[ __ ]
squirrel should be like cow or it just
gives you nuts or something and they're
like 1-1 that's a genius and elegant
idea
thank you
they're just called big nuts
but you got me there
i'm going risky with the four squad
temporarily
i beat bear's four squad last round yeah
up against the again there's foreskin
last time dude did you do that
uh but i'll probably just go up against
the game
someone was keeping that
what do we got here show me show me that
he's running a hedgehog build man
oh bad all right
oh that was not good
but there's gonna go here we go
it's insane that's insane
craziest fight ever
oh ryan
[Laughter]
this is stupid why am i i'm about to do
this this is this might make no sense
point so awful at this i'm like the
opposite of sin
i didn't i didn't even win last last
match-up that is true i think about it
bro the scaling is so slow oh
okay
it's not so great
it's not so great
slow and steady wins the race
i've heard that i'm taking a long trip
unless someone's going faster than you
while also being slow yeah whatever yeah
that's a good point
they're being like medium and you know
kind of pushing the pace a little bit
sorry i'm taking a long time on this one
because it's complicated dude is it
though it's very complicated my dude
what's so complicated about already
having a snake and a tiger
what
that is pretty amazing you liar you lie
of course he's lying it's not even
possible
[Laughter]
anybody lying right now or just mouth
i'm lying
dude there's so many animals they gotta
add into the next dlc lions bears foxes
oh my god it's not a bear no berries
frogs like any number of lizards and
things
toad big toad think about big toes big
toe is pretty neat that'd be good i got
grendel
oh robber

don't want to kill that
you don't want to kill that i do maybe i
do
oh no oh no

with the hedgehog attack strap
you can't you can't give it away rob oh
well one rick that's up my first loss
ryan
that's like my first win
uh
except i did go up against bailey just
three squad and then but that didn't
feel right
is it time
i don't i don't have anything close to
that
but i do kind of want to do it
hmm yeah i guess i could
it's
too late but [ __ ] it
[ __ ] it dude
it's not good
it's not good
but we're on tier 4 right
and chocolate's tier five right yeah
yeah yeah
decent gear or something went wrong
oh
no it didn't raise my bill
you have like a minute why are you
freaking out
cause my turn i ended turn and it said
d-sync and then my pill is not frozen
anymore but i can't click on it and
freeze it
oh yeah that sucks
i need that to kill my spider so it
spits out a snail that does nothing for
me i had to happen with double chocolate
once oh that's i don't even know what
you're saying

goes
the numbers don't lie there's too big
how did that order of operations even
matter how did that happen

a dog which is just like a lesser
that just horse makes no sense
that makes no sense you're just mad
because you lost dude it's true yeah

that that might be it
oh
oh oh
oh i think this is it
we're so close to greatness but
it's just tough
i feel you man
the past how 40 minutes of gameplay i
still haven't played ryan a single time
it's true yeah
that's hilarious
i'm just hoping for a top three you know
i'll take that on at this point honestly
we pivoted here
you pivoted oh good that means i have a
chance um
dude my team was not like i just now got
my first level two yeah but hippo
counters me is what i'm saying like
is did you go turkey fly you peace no i
have whale deer you peace okay that's
whale deer
i remember my first deer
i was nice for
all right
uh who you fight maybe is based on
your readying up time yeah apparently
well maybe
yeah could be you get easier opponents
if you ready up faster
that's not true at all
no
mouth you [ __ ] oh
oh yeah i got the same thing ryan
this guy's rocking dragon you know what
dragon honestly is like dragons
dragon soul oh my god
malcolm
shot on a dragon once
this ain't working
we got him
ladies and gentlemen
all right don't ready up first if you
want to um
go up against me
i mean only ready up first if you want
to go up against me
you know do you guys think there's time
to pivot away from anything
yeah dude
you could pivot there's pivot time it's
only raised 11 pivot time for me
this should be okay i think
no when you think about it like
just leaving one of your animals to die
at the front is kind of like melon armor
just like true choosing a sacrificial
animal to go in front of your best
animal
that's melon armor man
that's amore it is
so uh who's still going
i am sorry this is a hard round i'm
waiting
for do i upgrade my fly or my turkey i
don't know i'm waiting on alpaca patrol
i'm dead dude how many how many uh emoji
animals are there like do they have a
lot of stuff down the pipe like
oh yeah they're art already they're
gonna add um two-man wrestling i think
in the next one oh yeah
now i'm in hospital and taxi i think are
going to be added in the next game oh
dude i'm gonna be down
they need to add workshop support so
that we could add all of these
all right sorry i took my long turn
it was done oh this has got to be ryan
hello
thanks for making making me i'm fighting
your clone i waited for your clone the
[ __ ] thing
turkey doesn't work i'm a lot flying hey
turkey everybody go get a snack
[Laughter]

ignorant man
you have one chance
oh no
like whatever
i won so now i feel bad but
it's
just
just takes forever
it's like you ragging on someone else's
whiplash answer you guys are crabs in a
bucketing each other and melts running
away to the finish line with four lives
nah i
got scaling issues though man he does
he's not wrong about that
oh no the last ditch effort
my shops are quick though
the last ditch effort
please live for one more round give me a
clone give me give me a weak clone
oh that makes sense
that's this is the first time in my
entire life
i basically took a counter pick
normally because i was just thinking i
was thinking about who's left what i've
seen and open information and i thought
to myself i think this thing i think
this thing's good
so he's so you stream snapped everybody
it's not stream sniping if i played you
last round
wait no you haven't played me since i
pivoted
oh [ __ ] i played you last round on my
screen that was after i pivoted
you had a turkey man you had a turkey
that's all i'm gonna say that and that's
all that needs to be said oh my god if
you counter the turkey and i have to
fight you for the first time
who's this oh
it's coach yeah
here we go what is going on with your
team
whose team fly down fly down crandor's
team

wait there's hope there is hope there is
hope
how does the rng that
bad
absolutely dumpster whatever dude
you're you're actually just lucky that
all your random damage went absolutely
yeah okay
i actually just got
[ __ ] you're the luckiest person ever and
i'm so mad well i pivoted from uh i
could have rolled the snake in and the
snake one shot of turkey on the first
goddamn rock dude oh dudes invictus
build
yeah he's got the fly build
[Laughter]
now we just need we i know exactly what
we need here you gotta go get out of my
face
rage pisses when you do kegels while you

right like so what are you doing then
rob
what is the kegel i'm giggling right now
baby
i've been giggling since i joined the
call
you can also do reverse kegels
that's if it's too tight up in there
i've never
never had that problem personally
yeah i got a real floppy dick
this is this is what we can't say on the
football podcast
[Laughter]
sure the entire football podcast is in
this
uh super autopsy that's true actually
like the whole thing
even regular guest apollo
what was the thing we talked about
tortillas
oh we had one tortilla conversation
everyone was like dude it's devolving
the nlss yeah
ever talking about anything is is
stealing the nss pretty much yeah
i mean we could bring it here like you
guys flower or corn tortilla people oh
dude i love this conversation because
fresh corn store-bought flour
i love that i love that breakdown i
agree completely
i like i said flour tortillas like if
you walk by the aisle in the store it
makes me nauseous
really yeah he does he says i don't like
the smell of him i like eating them but
i don't like the smell
the but aren't they in like a bag or
something yeah you can still smell them
i don't know about that you can still
smell them cranberry can still smell of
apparently i've never experienced that
got a good nose uh
oh boy here we go indoors clone
hey frick off fire fire fire crab down
holy crap melon armor he's a shooter
mcgavin bill he's actually kind of
cracked
i just dude i changed up my whole team
uh and it didn't uh it was not good
yeah
thank god krendor's clone lost
we're still cruising
this
it's getting tight now it's 2-2-1
yeah those kegel exercises are working
that's yeah
gotta get that
tight dick feel gotta get up
gotta get there
tight dick feet get there
just go with it you don't throw the baby
out with the bath water
i think you threw it out oh i just
dropped out you know people it's like
your hockey team they lose two games and
like we gotta fire the coach we gotta
change all the systems it's like come on
man that'd be me saying they're the
[Laughter]
and we've won two in a row since
everybody got fired
you frick
oh here we go god
it's so shooty
it's all about shooting
it it is my problem is i didn't get
shooty early enough um
your clone would have beaten ryan um i
don't think so no i mean it's
melon armor i don't think so i'm pretty
good
uh okay i'm kind of cracked
no your front line was dead if you
didn't have that melon armor
well yeah hey i got this melon armor
fair and square
that's what i'm saying the mouth would
have would have taken you down
yeah well if my grandma had wheels she'd
be a bicycle
why does that
make some plastic or a car or uh
you know a game show slash could have
been a game show ryan loses
if krendor's
[ __ ] rng squad hits the right
targets it's possible it's all rng
that's why i don't go shooter build i
love it though like it's
i like i know i don't know what i said
i love it
i just love it it's just so they shoot
they hit the eyes i just love shooting
oh guys here we go round three best part
all right crab's still there
frick your cat
i've never freaked my cat i've never
uh
yeah i got screwed like i didn't scale
quick enough man yeah it sucks it
happens
i had an otter
yeah
lately ggg i got you geez
i think so
ryan can i ask you a question yeah yeah
yeah
it's it's concerning a choice you made
i'm not i'm not trolling or trying to be
um
would you have considered putting the
one up on the tiger in case it gets
sniped
um i guess knowing that krendor's the
last person alive that probably would
have been a shrewd move
i'm only i'm just asking that's all i
want to know
but no i have the scorpion there to eat
the aggression
okay holy crap
jesus
all right fire
oh my god
yeah dude that's kind of like it's kind
of sick honestly
oh my god well he's coming out of this
one wrap it up boys hey i got two hp i
got one hp left yeah all right all right
dude this is fire and then they all did
multiple times yeah what the hell am i
gonna do
[ __ ] scorpion dude like [ __ ] [ __ ]
no one of the best defenses you can have
is just more scorpions
yeah hank scorpio meta
might work
it's a good episode
it is a great episode
back when simpsons was good
those were the days
nice

sorry brian are you really pivoting to
rhino this late in the game
i'm just telling you cheeky skunk just
the cheeky skunk that steals some
aggression i think it'll work i think
it's not i don't think it's gonna work
oh no it hits still after yeah i'm
telling you you got to put on fast
forward it's oh it's going to change
your your perception of events
yeah that that was a great honestly
great game great game good game

the delicious eruptions that's pretty
good that's pretty good i'm the sticky
eggplants that's pretty good

choice
title that i'm gonna have to contest
lord of spelunky is the name i use in
games i think i'll only play once
oh damn but that like i was wrong
obviously yeah no clearly
bro um
um
no
i'm playing
i'm playing wild minus 10 a megalo
it could be worse like in you know my
new best friend ludwig i don't know if
he's still in chat we're really close
now but he made his game uh bald his
name is bald people rule and then now
he's wow he's stuck with that forever do
you think people would really go around
on the internet tell alive wow
loki
wasn't here
for a horse build loki that's crazy
horses
you're really shaping up the meta right
now remind me a little song by q lazarus
from silence of the lambs goodbye horses
that joke took a lot of time to develop
there
brian you'd be sickened by apollos
i didn't have anything else you won why
are you yelling at me
well you're making fun of me for my crap
horse build we dropped it we draw these
you mean horsemen i've got one horse
that's a horse build
you've made a horse build with one horse
all right oh here we go okay okay
there's some hope damn there's some hope
here
i'm really glad i was able to draw with
you twice actually dude that pig is
gonna win you some serious rounds that's
a big pig i feel like it's gonna fall
off real quick i'm hoping i never see it
again honestly
this is not a good thing but it's good
enough i'm having a tough one
and i will be uh
i will be waiting for opponents
oh
you know what
all right how many crabs is uh
ryan i have zero crab honestly my team
is very kind of like my mouth has a
crack the only reason i took the crab
was because i evolved and that's the one
that popped up and i hate it when they
give me something and i'm like i don't
want to take that evolved
whatever so i had to take it you wait
you evolved pre-turned not evolved but
you know you merge the dudes and you get
a freebie
yeah
my team's kind of bad right now but my
thing my team is horrible i i'm gonna
lose i don't know we'll see about that
i got a big pig yeah how big your hog
ah [ __ ] he didn't get any bigger but i
built more around the hog at least
usually you try to lose things around
the hog and it makes it appear i missed
plus that does make sense yeah
oh
robert i'm back with a vengeance i'm not
so victim
horse built
see he's a horse builder i've got okay
is that he's going to beat me anyway
okay fair enough
dude i'm getting owned
hey i mean you
beat me the first time it's it's 1-1
you did it true i want i went around for
the first time
i just can't get
all right you know what oh
you guys just cannot hang with the
delicious eruptions that works i guess
i don't there's any any
i mean we do this
i i got no idea what i'm doing in this
game still i'm so bad
oh
you know what
oh

debatable did not just change my life
okay
and then we roll
um
to this
none of those are an answer in turn
anybody else up late playing with the
worm right now or just me
[Laughter]
oh jeez i don't know what i'm doing
anymore i'm i'm losing is what i'm doing
i need a synergy man
you're all right yeah i'm fine just
dropped my water bottle um all right now
if i had a great idea last night
you should write a movie
where
sneezing is like pooping where if you
feel the urge come on you can delay it
and then just have like a 15 minute
sneeze in the bathroom
and then the flip side
are you ready for the flip side
the flip side is that pooping is like
sneezing where as soon as you feel the
urge coming on you gotta do it
immediately
that's a movie right it's well you know
it could start as like a youtube short
and then take it from there
um i don't know
not feeling passionate about it well are
you feeling passionate about the fact
you beat my
ass there
oh i forgot about the melon armor thing
oh whatever yeah i [ __ ] up my whatever
i power through you with my kangaroo
dog
let's go
yummy
probably should have got that
how do i fix this i only got two life
left man this is insane
i've got one
life's rough and you beat me
that is true does that happen
this is like the taxes against the jets
man like
you know who doesn't win that one the
advertisers
he's right about that
he's very right about that i don't think
anyone wins when that happens yeah
dude i'm pivoting the shrimp scampi now
you liar you liar
i you're gonna lose your mind when you
see what i do with this shrimp i don't
want to play you again your crab squad's
too strong right now i might die against
the next opponent yeah and then it just
kicks you to the main menu
i don't get to watch no there's no
spectator mode but oh that's nonsense
just pull up the stream i guess so
i'm not streaming though
yeah it's true he does have the most
life left
they need a spectator mode for sure
yeah i know that would be there's a
there's a few things they could do like
if they allow you to remove certain
animals or items
from the lobbies too that'd be fun oh
yeah 1v1 final destination no items yeah
if you could just you just fish
now we're talking i'm holding up the
line here come on dude it's not mlg geez
i look i just have some decisions to
make and what's better it gets hard man
you got all this stuff and then the game
throws you a crocodile and you're like i
want that and then you have penguin in
your shop and you got some plus twos and
you're like is that better than the
level one whale and the turtle combo or
should it like it's complicated man got
all this juice and only so much squeeze
exactly he gets
i haven't even gotten one upgrade on one
animal this whole time
i got i got exactly one upgrade
i read
the spider for a level three no no
that's invicta come on
is feeding his rat garlic i don't like
that
come on man oh no
wrap love garlic dude what is going on
with this volley i'm i'm going a lethal
man i'm i'm on one hp
the freaking heck
yeah dude that was close
that's [ __ ] that the villain comes
out after burn
thanks for
he said the word wrong
[Laughter]
but i'll honestly probably be out kind
of soon i'm gonna lose this next round
almost certainly yeah all right i'll go
to ryan's if he's still in
oh my god
i'm i'm making some absolutely enormous
plays
i you know what i
i flubbed it a little bit in that run
and that's okay because
it was a warm up after my 10 win you
know
i finally freaking found a pair i can't
even buy it
that's rough i've made agreements i've
made a grievous error you know this is
like when they tell you in chess general
kenobi over the board tournaments
they're like you don't need to rush you
got two hours on the clock you know
somebody in the call is gonna take three
minutes they're gonna take the whole
time to finish their turn you might as
well just not hit the enter button until
you're done no i and you know we can all
have a nice little discussion about this
because people in my chat are already
giving me [ __ ] for it i don't take can
all right i think i think you're a bad
idea i think you're right
early it's early cane or no can well
yeah i think you can if you are
expecting to change your lineup in the
future but if your lineup is set and you
got scaling you don't need can you don't
need can i think how early are you
sure my turn
if you're winning early you can buy can
because you you're like investing in
your future but if you're late it's too
slow as a ketchup by ammo
but what about canna corn and i'll be
all right what about it what about grade
point great point really salient point
their mouth thank you for uh weighing in
so properly on the on the dolphin and
here oh you [ __ ]
wait it is my rooster
you're not playing against
we think we're playing against two
different people right now i think
baird just
the the the dolphin ruined everything
it's a big kangaroo there i'm dead man
wait who the hell is bear taffy
oh because i think someone's dead you
don't have enough bears so i just got
eliminated by somebody who's not even
you've got a turtle you cheated
[Laughter]
that's actually like staggering
well i'm leaving your stream minus one
viewer
[Laughter]
should i should i turn my stream on
went terribly man
that like could not have gone where i
got zero wins
i got a couple wins you beat me
i did beat you that's right
and you have like 3 000 hours how many
hours do you have in this by now
actually i don't know let me check
i'm not it's not like i got anything
better to do um update cued what the
heck i have 86 hours in this
why okay
that's not as long as i would have yeah
i know i'm getting cyber bullied by
people who are like addicted addicted
people the people that have 300 hours in
new world and i've already like quit
since then
i have turned my stream on just in case
all right i've got i've got winner's
point of view for you right here you
take your time i'm just gonna like go to
the bathroom
okay fine why not
i've got winner's point of view here huh
yeah yes we got to be confident you know
like i may lose but if i say that i got
a winner's point of view here and then i
win it looks like i knew the whole time
and if i lose i just go ah what can you
do about rng the game sucks you know
like and then
i thought rooster was low tier mr apollo
i didn't say [ __ ] about rooster what
hey you guys were like uh yeah if you go
rooster
uh turkey
uh fly turkey
okay fair enough rooster rooster is that
hot [ __ ] dude
i like the menu music it's a great jam
dude
bob
oh all right this is the true battle
okay oh boy and i've definitely won the
team name battle
thank you
pieces you piece you rude pieces
i mean everything is not good
oh that's looking bad apollo
yeah the the we need a little bit more i
think he oh he's got a monkey too but
i've got a level two monkey i don't got
no monkey i'm talking about some victor
you got the
you even overrode the garlic shield and
it worked for you
we still got there
oh yeah i got a sorry i'm not fast
forwarding not bad oh yeah same i don't
fast forward i like to enjoy every bite
we have to sell something now if we do
this though don't i let me i'm gonna
permission to stream your stream
permission to restream your story
permission granted i didn't get any
permission i just did it i do re as well
i'm like dude i can't i don't want to
say what you're building in case people
counter you
but yeah dude
round 10 i would give apollo's squad a
relative elo of
1900
that's very good that's a that's a good
high that's a good elo
i mean grand man
2500 right so yeah he's i mean he's not
quite there i mean come on
look at this i mean he does have a melon
armor overriding a garlic armor yeah
mistake i already said and he's got a
level brewster in the first slot i mean
man
grinder says tiger rooster is only a
step below turkey fly
there is a there is something to be said
there but tiger is just fun
this is pretty shy for a turkey flight
dan ant dinner
let's do this
let's see what the heck is that oh sorry
i have a second phone in my room oh
that's the second challenge
george jetson walter white i think so
yeah
his second fault
it's like the hobbits too
tell us pressure
[Laughter]
see if you had the the canned food
like uh who was who's shooting on canned
food earlier i was sitting on cancer
i was [ __ ]
you could swap out some of your animals
here if you canned up earlier i'm just
going to keep scaling honestly i think
this is safest
who is this
sold all your dudes
oh it's a 30 now huh
this little bastard just keeps getting
stronger
chunky rooster man leave the monkey
alone
i hate this
i got it scaled hard
oh this is good numbers right here
that's good numbers
it's a
w man you guys are really playing on
normal speed huh sorry i keep uh fast
forward there sorry
i'm just like just like sitting back and
you know relaxing man
you do the calculation so we've only got
apollo and sin victor remaining no i'm
left i have one oh you have one heart
left can you sweat here by the day
i see
let's see squad's looking good
i guess i could just sell this do i need
this looking good
is this i mean
yeah
i mean
a bold play joe
you don't see that that often in the
current super auto pets league
he has destroyed his level 2 monkey
betting on winning now instead of
investing in scaling
oh
doesn't work doesn't do anything that's
true it doesn't level up right
i'm desperate
oh
but he's got
we're just we're just gonna call that
you know
delightful
do you guys want to get uh crendor in
the next lobby by the way he's around to
play yeah if well do we have to invite
him to the discord or do i guess oh i
don't know
look it's not it it's not a knock on
granddaughter it's just the the we're
we're opening up the discord
increasingly every game
we we could go to craft i guess yeah
it's going to be a problem no i'm just
saying it's the only notorious discord
uh
five hours a day the time is very
precious to me
i'm not eating
doordash on stream two times a day i'm
trying to
keep it flush at the margins with
content
i'll have you know i stream way less
than you sir okay
i think this is just the way i think
this is
i think i just don't want to get uh this
so we gotta do it you know this might be
crazy but oh we cannot connect let me
just do that so do we have we have
apollo on
threes in victon two is that correct
yeah i think they're both on one yeah
the it's
apollo's on three and the other two are
on one
no mal's dead
i just i got one out i just beat him she
kicked into the ground oh okay okay the
first thing i said is right that's true
i don't know how this is
i'm waiting to go maybe it's because
it's an odd number i don't know yeah you
maybe you like beat a clone and that
doesn't count as a as a life
look i keep forgetting about the dang
turtle all right whatever
he's just chilling dude he's just
chilling i mean at this point it's the
melons probably better than the garlic
there's nothing much else i can do to
change things i'm just trying to keep
this [ __ ] alive which is why i bought
the dang mushroom yeah i we need a
gentleman's agreement next game that
when
the clock hits 1 30 we just fill the
audio portion of the discord call with
just screaming
i mean i'm waiting for opponents
my shops have been quick
i'm fighting mouth again oh
apollo is fighting real mouths and
viktor's fighting clone mel
oh geez
yeah no this kangaroo gets uh stinky oh
yeah level three
you got tiger claw back there with the
one up okay yeah the level you know what
level three kangaroo that's okay looking
pretty good
[ __ ]
uh oh stinky
i've never had a lot of respect for
level three kangaroo but you know mouth
is now officially dead dead
uh yeah and it goes to 1v1
paula's got a tiger now
maybe
yeah we do
yeah
dad yeah stop giving in the intel stop
giving the intel well it's too late
enjoy enjoy your food
the desperation sushi play
sometimes you got no other options
this sushi's pretty good um he's all
right like i only got seven hours in
this game man i'm i'm an
well you got tiger if you got tiger uh
kangaroo i'm gonna lose
it's it's a nasty squad we got here i'm
gonna restream ryan restreaming apology
sure that's just big an idea
hey good good game apollo is with three
lives remaining
well played i'm kind of i'm stunned
i'm flabbergasted
hey i played in auto battle or rivals
all right i've got experience
that's true okay you guys want to move
over to does everybody here have access
to that craft
yeah i'm pretty sure okay okay yeah
let's move over to that craft let's do
it
um anyone going to make the jump oh i
didn't sorry
justin because now justin's like i just
noticed i could jump in and i'm like
yeah
do it i got to remake the lobby i got to
add two to the existing player count
remember how many players there were in
the last game



here we are um what i don't even know if
i'm in freedom i didn't run a casino i
don't know if i'm in free to play i
don't know if i'm in pay to win
this is uh you know this is chaos mode
right here right and we've got three
neutral animals i have no idea whether
we're in
we're in pay to win or free to play oh
horses pay to win okay horses horse or a
horse is free to play i should say horse
is free to play
um
it's a horrible shop i will buy a
cricket as a hedge this is adding bonds
to your portfolio even though their
expected real returns are negative it's
nice to have some ballast just in case
you roll like horse horse horse
no it's a pretty good setup there i'm
gonna freeze a beaver and i'm to take a
fish and then we're going to win the 50
50 here and it's going to hit the fish
that's not a bad start this this is like
a this is a 40 to 60 percent
strong situation
um
be the iconic doggies
like shiba inu and
the the doji lawn mars coin
i think we win this man
we got lucky our opponent ran a duck
there's one one win
dude is this simple
hit the 50 50. let's go
you can fit a beaver
i'm willing to roll one roll me again
toss me an ants
put the otter out here
okay this this squad is basically just
it exists and the stats are decent
dude don't even get me started okay i
was watching dan play isaac today
i know dan he wants to be diplomatic
but he can't help but uh we draw these
by the way but say some stuff man he
can't help us say some stuff about super
auto pets he's always got to sneak in
like a little just a little like hey
it's a great game i really love it
game's really good i just you know
tell me you
your favorite subject in sixth grade was
math and you had no friends without
telling me your favorite subject in
sixth grade it was math and you had no
friends but this guy he was talking so
much about how like i get it like if you
love numbers then you're gonna love
super auto pets if you like meanwhile he
was doing like a tainted eden isaac run
where
uh he had like 18 damage with seven
decimal points after it and then like
every half second it would tick down
like a random number that was like a
fraction between you know one over two
and one over twenty and like every room
that he went in like his his speed stat
and his tier stat like redirected and
stuff like that and i'm like this kid is
ten times more simpler than isaac man
there's like five items in the whole
game
that's okay i can understand that
he's annoyed because people
pardon me are asking him when he's gonna
play super auto pets that's like the
irony of of twitch right now
i'm i i am annoyed when uh people are
like play something other than super
auto pets every other stream right now
is like when are you gonna play super
auto pets
it's it's suffering from success anyway
all these animals are are doo-doo this
is kind of sick don't get me wrong
but
hit the 50 50. you son of a okay then we
roll
um well that's unfortunate you know what
i'm just like built different
if we're not gonna get a pair here so be
it
spend way too much money on pure garbage
freeze one of these
yeah you know what buy me an elephant
and i'd love winning
you're running
you're running the horses man
you're running horses like why
i at some point like the the word is
gonna get out you literally can't run
horses
it's not doable
please give me an animal i've seen
before
there are many they are myriad
thank you so much that's a very nice
help honestly we've got really bad
scaling
this is not good
you lost the horses yesterday
yeah once after beating them like 30
times
dude honestly give me this 4 6 elephant
i am the elephant hater has logged on
but let's give it a try
i see great minds think alike
that's beautiful we win these
i dude i look i also think the elephant
is is bad i think it's borderline
unplayable i just think we're in kind of
a unique situation here where
i have to
run some animals that are not that good
because our shops have been kind of
doo-doo but the stats don't lie
i'm literally gonna level you up just to
get a higher tier animal this is not the
higher tier animal that i'm like looking
for
it could work for us later i don't think
it's that strong right now
skunk meta
gretchen weiner's voice stop trying to
make skunk happen
i'm willing to fit you
just for a brief moment
i'm i'm kind of
staggered
by how
like non-paired our shops have been it
turns out we should have stuck with the
beaver a little bit longer um but at
least like the stats on our animals are
like not too bad holy crap man i don't
know i guess we can fit a camel in here
with oh that elephant's gonna kill my
whole squad man
i i wasn't thinking straight
no actually we're gonna be totally fine
what
it's so good
it coming a mile away and yet somehow we
still win like i don't know dude we're
getting pretty lucky right now i'm just
gonna be honest with you okay you don't
have to be here anymore
you should be here
you you fit you kind of fit
i'm keeping you around just because we
we can't afford to be like too greedy
right now
and then there's a part of me that's
like you know you could actually
sell this
buy this please buff my fish
like the beaver is actually winning us
the game right now
just by virtue of all the hp we've
gotten from selling it
like it's it's kind of insane
oh that's that's a you peace moment
right there
this looks like it is probably our first
loss if i had to guess
no no need to guess
no the elephant belongs there right now
like i'm not saying it belongs in the
squad at all because it's like bad
but uh
like this is the right spot for it for
the moment
i you know
malf said something has stuck with me a
little bit he said you got to dance with
the one that brought you that's what
we're doing here we're dancing with the
one that brought us i think
look for now keep keep this out here
we're gonna sell a giraffe buy a
crocodile next time
i'm gonna buff my my camel a little bit
here which in turn will buff my swan
he did say that about a horse but you
know a broken watch is right now and
then
it worked
you talking about a swan skunk swan
whatever dude i don't know animals i not
no joke
i actually like i think i've learned
more about animal identification from
reading children's books to my daughter
than uh
like i did in my biology degree
why is the elephant here okay let me
explain all right the elephant is here
it's gonna hit two units behind it okay
we want it to hit the camel
because when the camel gets hit it will
actually pass back
to
hp
so every hit that it gives here is
actually generating two hp for this one
even though it's also taking one
um
i don't know where else would fit that
you could uh that you could put it
now here's the i know
people are like
you could swap
squat swap the skunk with the blowfish
this is true
but i'm this highlights this is a great
teachable moment people overrate the
text of the animals in super auto pets
and underrate the numbers so there is
something to be said about adding a
blowfish to the squad and i think it
would be more fun and i think it would
actually possibly work however
i don't think you replace your six nine
when we're on the believer cliff i think
you replace your 2-4 even though it
gives you scaling the scaling is kind of
ass
and then you roll the blowfish right
there and you keep the skunk at the back
you might replace it with a crocodile
we'll have to think about it i'd like to
replace it with something even better
but
okay give me one of those
honestly you could roll a meat on your
camel
freeze me this would be nice this would
be nice you could roll a meat on this
camel man
i'm telling you people
over
believe oh nice shot
people overrate the effect of
the cards and some of the cards it's
warranted but they very much underrate
the actual like the efficacy of the
stats to begin with
that's just beautiful that's i mean the
dolphin was just
hard countered can't be mad okay skunk
is time for you to go but you did serve
a valuable purpose briefly
so give me one of those
sell me
i think you can freeze a turtle as like
a maybe
if you're gonna if you're gonna roll it
as a maybe
you might as well just roll it right now
and then buff that camel a little bit
dolphin i think has come up in this meta
which is basically my way of saying it
was probably always good
um but i didn't give it the respect it
deserved at the time
we need some garlic oh that would have
been freaking sweet dude we're going
down here
okay this we're on the doubter threshold
it's scary
frees me a scorpion this this can change
things scorpion does really well in a
garlic world
roll me once
this is a no-brainer
six gold remains
i'm just gonna level with you i don't
think this blowfish like needs to exist
anymore i don't think it's doing as much
as i thought i think i fell victim to
its siren song
i think you can roll a scorpion up at
the front they're not going to be
rolling melons so i'm not sweating that
in the slightest
i doubt this will help but this this is
a short-term buy in order specifically
to help the believers
i don't know white weenie build
there's a chance here
there's a chance
nice melon you're going to summon
something this oh you son of a
the spider spit now rams man it's all
gonna come down to our fish here at the
back
i hate when a spider spits out rams man
it's driving me crazy
okay but at least honestly this fish is
getting pretty strong
we lose
we we lose this
oh come on man
all right we'll pay out the
we'll pay out the doubters on that it's
just a hot match honestly like
i'm not trying to to say that there's
nothing we could have done because we
did get we dug ourselves a hole in like
a nasty meta but like we had truly
ass shops
for like five rounds
and like this shop is pretty bad as well
i'm gonna buy one cricket yet again is
ballast
is it just in case cricket
sometimes you got to do what you got to
do
i'm just asking you for like some fish
okay i'll be the i'll be the um i'll be
the broken i'll be the i'll be the uh
i'll be the witty tugboat
sound that could be the name of like a
superhero in the 1930s
i see a horse
i've lost some confidence so even though
i see a horse i'm like i don't know man
it could get me
i think we draw these
no we definitely lose these okay we've
just lost to a horse
if you were looking for any indication
that our shop was truly god-awful um
that would be it luckily they've doubled
down by giving us the same shop again
uh
but this time is going to be good
freeze me roll me
nah man there you go
we got a cricket an ant army
the only thing we lose to is uh
everything but ducks
please okay we're still in there that's
huge that's huge we win these
this is a dan build
i i have no control over the shops man
if they don't want to give me you know
fishes if they want to give me shrimps
and horses because they're like he's
been winning too much then fine like
what can i do this is what you gotta do
we'll combine
all right you piece you asked for it
quite frankly
there's a real temptation to shrimp
scampi here
screw it
you mess with the bull you get the damn
horns
okay that's a great buy me sell me this
is very important for space in our
future this should not be good like this
this is a bad squad to draw would be a
blessing
that's pretty nasty
sorry we do really well here
and that kangaroo is gonna run buckwild
on us though there's no way we're
getting around that it's definitely
gonna be a loss
has your opinion on the rabbit gone up
lately
yeah i mean i think it's like i would
say the rabbit is uh
is like a eight tier and i know that
might be a little controversial but
genuinely like
if you get an early rabbit
and then one unit you want to stick with
like you're kind of cruising quite
frankly
it sneaks up on you we can do better
than a fish at this point
but can we do better than a fish with a
cricket
as well i don't know that's a like to
get this going we got a seven nine that
spits out a tutu the rest of our squad
is pure garbage
how do you have a 10 attack rabbit oh
because of the dodo okay this is also
going to be a loss like this is
disastrous man
but it's way too late to start buffing a
2-3 fish
so how are you getting out of this it
starts with a sell
that's very helpful then you get a buy
then you get a sell
then you get a thank you then you get a
buy then you get a sell
thank you that's that's huge you can
freeze a fish
and run it a little bit in the future
or not a fish a meat
uh
although i will say i think for now
there's a part of me
that is like
freeze a turtle or bring a turtle
instead so got an 814 melon armor almost
level three cricket like this is the the
numbers on this look pretty good
i don't know if we can get through the
the peacock though three two three oh we
can we can get through the peacock we
win these
okay there you go
melon
it's tough right because like melon is
really good
but it's not as good as
garlic early
i think you can try
this
okay
realistically a 2 3 doesn't matter too
much
i'm going all in for the believers i'm
going to sell my 2 3 shrimp
to get enough gold
to buff the hp on my cricket by two
essentially
i think that makes the difference
i see lots of bees
this doesn't seem that bad
at all
gave the cricket two three but you sold
it two three to make it happen
can we would somebody like to explain to
the newbie
why one would do that
could it possibly be that a a two three
in your fourth position with no
equipment is not as valuable as as
adding those exact same stats up to
something uh
that has melon armor attached to it
just curious just curious script it's a
plant in the audience hold on
is this worth it basically we're
spending one gold on one random hp
it's not enough
i think it's not
enough look if you can just chill for a
minute we got something man
we can we can we need to find a way to
get three more
wins
the only way that that's gonna happen is
like
we need we need a unit that scales a
little bit
and honestly you need the meat more than
oh but you're going to need garlic and
some for now you need this meat okay
shops dude the shops
the shops are sending me for a freaking
loop
okay 2 3 with meat at least is something
i'm i'm not feeling optimistic about
this quite frankly
double crab meta it's not that much hp
but it is uh it's a little annoying
got 11 hp and a goose we definitely lose
this man this one's over
we'll pay out the doubter on that one
for sure
i went all in
the casino reserves no rights to uh
refunds
you're in control of your bets you get
all the winnings you reap the spoils you
also reap the costs
okay we were going in again we just this
that now we're talking there's honestly
like i got a little demoralized because
of the results so far
people won't believe in me we
legitimately had
truly god-awful early and mid-game shops
for like
the entire game so far this is now a
start where you're like okay things are
good this might be like the
mathematically best team
i'm okay with just freezing one ants
i'll be the friendly hipsters hey you
want to get some good coffee
don't shoot my aunt you peace we still
win probably
even with all that going down we still
win even with the perfect snipe
okay i mean i think you can
if you have to
roll three ants though i would prefer
not to like bart will be the scrivener
um this is a this is a weird one
like all of these are good plays
[Laughter]
it's just the question of which one is
the best play
i think you freeze the otter to use it
next time after you're able to combine
your ants i think you freeze the ants
and then you roll a second fish that's a
guaranteed four or five and it's
probably gonna eat a few of those buffs
but that's that's a really like just a
blessed situation we also had great
mosquito luck
you want to see ants that don't hit
other ants but that's fine we win these
for sure i mean this is just a dream
this is just a dream start
then you can go to hell um
do a quick combine gives us a kangaroo
you can definitely run a kangaroo
let's add the kangaroo to the squad
let's freeze it and unfreeze it then add
a kangaroo to the squad then we'll buy
our otter make sure it can't hit itself
it hits our ant that's fine roll once
you can absolutely run a four squad
marty
i don't think the camel is that viable
right now
i'm gonna i'm gonna pass it for the time
being
i think the kangaroo is great by itself
i don't think it needs an enabler
this ant kind of nasty with it
we don't live but we trade
that's nasty okay they got a great team
as well
missed out on a plus one plus one
when you buy the otter it's like one of
the rare situations where you don't
buy and then combine
if you because the trigger happens on
buy so if you if you have a level 1.5
otter you buy and put it on the side
then it's a 1-1 buff when you combine
you get nothing
so you buy into the combine and then you
get the plus two plus two
okay so we're gonna have to roll
one of these
i think you can get down honestly with a
spider in front of your kangaroo you get
minimum two triggers whereas the ant you
might only get one depending on the
strength of the unit in front of it
all i care is that we get strong enough
to kill the
the crab
and the fish okay we win those
it's not bad
so we need to figure out which of these
units is sticking around for the long
haul and the answer is i've got no clue
i think you can definitely upgrade this
kangaroo
the spider does not need to exist but i
don't want i don't really want to
replace it with anything here although i
will say
a whale
eating an ants
and then spitting one out is kind of
sick
i hate to say it
i'm gonna dump our otter
to roll a swan
it is eating an eight seven i i don't
disagree with that
that much is is patently true would have
been nice to know you were coming around
but you know what that's okay you know
hold on hold on hold on
i kept you over the otter because i
thought you would level but maybe that
will not happen
now we're talking we're running the
weirdest squad you're ever going to see
here
he's eating some trash
their squad is not that good we should
be okay he's eating some trash he's
feeding the swan
we get a nice trade on your big boy
we got a stronger unit we're getting
spat out here thanks for the buff
you love to see it okay trash that's
we'd love to see it it's garbage
we die there we live here we own you
not bad not bad
i haven't seen this for a long time
um
now we're probably not gonna roll the
whale forever it was nice while it
lasted
i honestly think that the play here and
you may doubt and and doubt is your
prerogative
ah
okay i sold my level two ant
can i tell you what happened
um
you already know what happened i'm sure
when you click on an animal in the shop
the freeze button
is here when you click on an animal you
own it turns into a sell button
it's entirely my own fault i take
responsibility for my actions
uh when you get a desync error error you
go like this really quick and then
you're good to go
that's my mistake
that's my mistake but you know what it
it
we can bail ourselves out of this we're
four wins on round six there's plenty of
time you buy a rabbit
level two kangaroo
now you start thinking okay
i think for now
the whale and the ant are very all we
need to do is get the scorpions and
replace these with scorpions and we win
so we're gonna buy garlic for our
kangaroo don't don't you do this to me
okay
we're gonna buy garlic for our kangaroo
thank you which buffs it
we're gonna freeze a cupcake just in
case because winds are worth something
we're going to freeze this i don't
really care for you quite frankly i'm
going to buff our kangaroo yet again
i mean it's not good like let's be
reasonable
[Laughter]
it was definitely a mistake to sell it
i'm just saying it's it's not
irredeemable this might be a draw
with the honey badger
actually it's a loss with the honey
badger that hurts
to to lose to a honey badger that would
not have happened with that ants
okay with our previous ant i should say
but but so be it
okay we definitely want you to get
buffed you we really just want a pill at
this point
but garlic is invaluable like it'll win
your rounds
can't really fit a penguin in here
okay
freeze me
salad me
not who i wanted to eat that
but a crab plus meat behind our kangaroo
can do something
this is this is also pretty nasty i mean
it's not getting any better
[Laughter]
we were unpunished yesterday we will
probably be punished today
at least we yeah there's no way we're
killing the dog
even if it didn't have a turtle there's
no way we're chunking through that
you didn't freeze the crab though did i
not am i am i that off my game because
it appears to be
[ __ ] frozen right there um
okay so
sell me
buy me
roll me
this is okay sell me
sell me
buy me
meet me
i don't know this this kangaroo is not
gonna pop
but
we can this is so weird but if you
combine both rabbits then you have space
for a turtle so you get at least two
kangaroo triggers
and then you get to keep the garlic
which i'm really relying on
this seems very bad that that ox we
don't get past the ox there's going to
be a lot of work done for crab here
okay we got kaminsky
oh no that's just doubt
i thought i thought we have one more
he doesn't respect the bison we didn't
have any level threes it's like you're
buying a
uh
a six six just to be like one day it'll
be good and you'll be saying that up in
heaven
okay we got 11 minutes
we can run one more back
i mean this is like if anything i mean
there is nothing else
you peace i'm at least glad that we're
finally silencing the people who are
like
you gotta change the betting line so
it's seven wins yeah
apology accepted
we had no choice but horse here hey hey
you know what
we draw these i'll take it
you should still up it pyromaniac 333
this one's for you
don't buff my horse i don't want to see
it
i'm entering my mind palace pyromaniac
133
freeze me
beautiful
the mind palace is being entered as we
speak the name is sticking pyromaniac
133 pyromaniac 133
it's a nasty little guy we definitely
lose this but we lose triple fish
quadruple fish i mean there's nothing
you could do about that great name too
the creamy balls
early combine
the kangaroo was not the fault in our
stars from the last one it's not the
kangaroo's fault
meet me
there's something to be said about maybe
putting meat just before your strong
unit though instead of your weak unit
or weakest
yeah because i think we lose oh
we win this because the kangaroo is just
a little bit too cracked there we go we
get one
pill this is the easiest pill of my life
i didn't want you to hit the fish but
you know what life goes on these are all
garbage
it's slightly too late for a dog imo
but i do not mind a six six
i do not mind a little swan attached to
the squad
i do not mind an otter and a swan next
time okay this squad has some statistics
this squad
it's got the elbow grease and the
know-how to lead us to a new land
i'm a little worried about how we're
gonna get through six hp i think the
answer is we're not
two losses
garlic is huge though okay it's a nice
buy hit the yeah okay i respect it
garlic does best on you for now
one of these i'm telling you people are
like rip rip my points rip my points
this is not rip your points everything
is this is actually going according to
plan right now
it would be nice to not lose this one
we'll keep it around in case it goes
wrong though
skipping turtle let me tell look i
believe in the i respect the turtle i
believe in the turtle
all i'm gonna say about the turtle is i
think it's a little better
uh
wow this guy is nasty man i think it's a
little better
later
but what do i know cause i'm getting my
ass beat right now
by stressful python who's got a kangaroo
with a kangaroo that's new tech i've
never considered before
now this is a this is our moment this is
our pivot point this is selmy
a by me a selmy
a by me
a by me
here we go care read carried a monkey
a by me a a freeze me
a romy a chill me
now that finally we got the kind of shop
we've been looking for here
this is uh we're going up against an
incredibly nasty squad yet again
these are the nastiest squads i've i've
ever seen in super auto pets history
i still think we win
that's the trade
we own you okay that's tough man that's
tough
like it's just a difficult squad but i
just wanted it more quite frankly i
think is what it came down to give me
one of these the otter has been great
but it no longer needs to exist
now the way you set up the squad it gets
a little spicy here but just bear with
me okay
you sell the otter it's already
accomplished what it was here to
accomplish
get out of my face honestly like you you
ruined chat
we have six sec six minutes okay there's
no problem we put you here
you need a buff
roll once
i'm just gonna be honest with you i'm
not messing around take another buff
very frightened by what this dog
presents to us i'm hopeful that you're
not going to get hp you got hp okay
that's fine our crab still owns you
our kangaroo goes buck wild
we win these we win these nice golden
poop
might as well make our shop a little
nicer
you need some meats
swan you've done your part you've been
around in the in the best of times and
in the worst of times
this organization couldn't have gotten
to where we are without you
we hit the line
no scorpio as long as i don't i don't
see scorpions i'm a very happy man
this is just i don't even need to
comment on this squad you already know
what's happening like
anybody that's still trying to roll like
a level one horse plus a bunch of bees
just like honestly
thank you for still playing the game
cause like you're giving the believers a
little bit of hope here and i really
appreciate that
now this squad is a little spicy right
now we'll do a roll i mean we are we're
on round nine like we're gonna run into
some nasty teams man um
there's a part of me this like you know
what
i think i gotta keep you around
don't not again
i'm keeping you around
to shoot a scorpion
holy crap finally level two fish
i'm keeping you around to shoot a
scorpion or maybe you could shoot a
turkey
what do you shoot here a knox
no i need you to shoot the ox
it's gonna get melon armor
this is is still okay
that ox is actually like straight
garbage huh
that bus not so much
okay
we live through this though we kill you
please please this is a big hit
we win these okay
[Laughter]
five wins there's a chance
now how the hell do you do this
i'm gonna be honest i think the crab can
probably go even though i love him
but it's a tough sell all right if we
just need to win one more we could sell
the monkey too but
the monkey's part of our long-term plans
i'm gonna try it man i'm gonna try it
sell me sell the crab
buy a fish
this is nice quite frankly this is nice
now we gotta think
i'm not gonna level up any of these
units
i'm gonna say that's okay to say no to
we're gonna sell a cow
we're gonna buy a cow
as much as i love a snake and i do we're
going to freeze the snake for a round
we're going to run a scorpion that's
going to get buffed by our monkey for
absolutely no reason
the scorpion is a is a better win now
play
and the snake is a better long-term
scaling play we're going to win this
round they had tiger monkey that's
basically like tell me you want to lose
without telling me you want to lose
okay now
now you
sell your scorpion
and you put a snake behind your kangaroo
and now we start to think about what it
would be like to win 10 times
you put a melon on your fish
freeze a cupcake just in case you don't
get extra benefits
and we didn't so you know what cupcake
that fish briefly now we go back to
square one it's a whole new game
this seems pretty terrible
it's a loss but you know what we got the
believers where we needed to get the
believers
and look at that
hey uh just uh
slash user
pyro maniac 333
pop it out here let's just see

june 2018 unbanned four days later
would you care to explain
i'm refreshing it's three years ago the
statute of limitations is up
that's not a second strike there's
nothing illegal about losing your points
in the casino
fled the scene fled the scene
all right slash marker
sap
i talked for a i talked to a mod about
it okay as long as you went through the
proper channels then there's nothing to
worry



hello i'm back welcome back i'm ready to
keep cracking on this on this meta a
little bit you know
see it's gonna take a little bit to
figure out how much to value a life
early on i know that sounds a little um
uh monka
i hate talking in twitch parlance just
kidding
i love it um
i think this is okay though i always i
have a preference
be the you know running presidents a lot
of presidents like to jog not just
presidents of the united states
who sing the peaches come in a cane or
sometimes not at all um but
also the presidents of major
corporations for example
peloton ceo he probably loves the jog
in many ways such as
yes okay yes
liking where we're at early
it's tough it's tough you can roll two
ants in my opinion but i also think that
you can roll two mosquitoes
as a
uh and i don't want to freeze the ant
i'm really i'm i'm learning the ant when
you invest in it you can still win but
it makes it harder to cut later which
can be uh
disadvantageous towards you but
regardless how we doing we're crushing
we're crushing easy mode um
double mosquito also is very good
anti-ant technology
though it falls off very fast later as
well so give me a combine give me a buy
snail is not what you want to see on
level up here we have one roll and two
purchases to play with
i would
freeze a cupcake
roll once
i would absolutely buy a swan
and you know what
let's get a four or five out there i i
think
getting your green beetle and your
mosquito one away from leveling up and
also stating them up a little bit
probably matters more look
it's a little lad who loves berries and
cream you got you gotta it's it's a mess
i hate to say this but you know you ask
for the criticism just kidding the puppy
when you buy it you gotta scale it it's
gotta scale
it's gotta scale
and
you can't put the ant at the back with a
one one puppy it gets sniped now you got
your ant at the very back it's ready to
crack it's no good
um
i think
i i don't want every run to be a dog
build
but i think you
it's very easy
to justify taking the dog
we should have maybe no i actually i
like this i like this um we should have
uh
let me rephrase um it's very easy to
justify taking the dog
because if you don't have anything else
that really like dominates your your
theming of the run the dog gives you uh
it's the the easiest way to describe it
it gives you
a reliable scaling engine
when no other scaling engine exists and
very often in the early game i mean you
don't get a scaling engine at tier 2
tier 3 that often so i think that's why
you're seeing the dog from me so much
um
truth be told it's now time for the
mosquito to go
and then we can definitely do a buy me
sell me i mean this is a dream shop for
like buy me sell me
love it
and after all those buy sells we're
still at nine gold
we'll do it again
[Laughter]
it's very nice quite frankly that takes
us to seven i think you can buy a rabbit
and then uh give your dog some garlic
armor
freeze a salad because with a rabbit
it's not so bad give me a double freeze
there we'll probably sell you get double
rabbit going we got a nice little flex
position no no no hold on you can't do
it like that you can do it like that if
you want
we need the the the sheeps are a nice
like mid game uh really early game if if
the meta is changed but they're a nice
um
as a scary early bust man but it's a
nice way for us to uh
to buff our dog early although i will
admit i think you had a great thing
going with your your that early deer
just pretty much ran wild on us it's
gonna take two lives out of our pocket
i got nothing but respect
so
you or you gotta go
i'm gonna say that
honestly i'm actually gonna say that
it's you
and then
you got to do this in the
maybe not the right order but not the
wrongest order
this seems okay
honestly dog kind of just chilling
i think you want a worm
um
okay i'm gonna
this is actually like a it's a
delightful position to be in because
it's a little weird it's a little spooky
um and you can make many decisions all
of them could be right all of them could
be wrong or the matrix could be
somewhere in the middle but i'm gonna do
a purchase of a rabbit
sell it and then buy a worm
get that double buff going on our dog um
i'm gonna freeze the garlic to make our
worm better as well next turn i don't
know if this is gonna make it this round
but
it's looking pretty bad like anytime i
see a kangaroo i'm just like i
already know like we're getting into
some nightmare territory
kangaroo camel especially but this is we
we've deliberately taken a little bit of
a step back in order to hopefully get
the worm to scale us and outpace people
in the future um which is what i'm
hoping is gonna happen but for now
that's beautiful we got a little lucky
we take those though
what the heck's going on here
okay give me one of those there you go
now we got a 4 6 garlic armor that's
nothing to sneeze at um
truth be told although i think this sets
us back even further i am going to sell
our ladybug i'm gonna buy a squirrel man
i know is a little spooky
it hit our worm i it was a real risk
don't get me wrong that was a risk
i wish to save nothing
freeze me
freeze me
i honestly think
a 7 13 6 9 both with garlic armor they
can get it done now i see that we have
another kangaroo
no disrespect meant but like do you hate
um having fun
is that just the thing that that it uh
doesn't interest you is enjoying
yourself um so we're gonna lose this one
as well
i really think i gotta start putting
some more respect on the kangaroo's name
like by itself it's like a mid-game
superstar that is what you are coming
from afar reaching for the stars let's
go run away with me by the way to
another place we can rely on each other
aha
okay we're gonna sell
we should just pick one good unit rather
than buy sell here in my opinion we can
actually
do a buy sell
and we need to win this one obviously
we're on lethal like this squad is
pretty good
or at least it's not that bad
[Laughter]
you know
while the buy does give us a a stat on
our dog
but you know what i think i think you
salad here that's just a straight-up
salad play in my world now we might lose
this and if we do then i'll accept it
this doesn't look too bad
ice well actually you know what it looks
kind of horrible now but
no no we're fine okay i like your snipe
build
at least we're on five wins now like
it's not like we're doing too badly we
ran into a pretty nasty stretch of
course but
not hitting the right units but that's
okay it's okay
i think we gotta freeze a deer
knowing like its value we we if we're
ever going to make this we're going to
need a dog to pop for sure
and a swan we can kind of hold for the
future so i actually think we just feed
the worm a little bit what is it now
it's a 12 17 it's a 12 18.
congratulations you've earned it um why
don't you give me
um like a buy and a cell
just to get a small buff put that deer
up at the front
13-18 congratulations you played
yourself
we don't have late game prospects but we
we can tough it out here a little bit
okay i do not like to see
this person has constructed a pretty
cool build
they they put a rooster in at like the
right time
hold on though hold on
we managed to come out of that with a
win that day we've crossed the believer
threshold at six wins
hatching check this late very very
interesting
for certain
i think you could definitely fit it as
like the last ad
we should have frozen our dog too i
don't know what i was thinking there
either way this keep it going swan is
helping us out we're going to freeze a
hatching chick because we want to see it
salad me
the rabbit's got to go at some point is
that point right now
i think the answer is not yet
i just don't quite think we're there
we're gonna roll a hatching chick in
that case spend three to give me like a
random buff that's like i'm realizing
quickly that the the efficacy of that is
like so much lower than i
like to to spend three gold to get one
health or one attack on our dog is
probably reaching the level of
diminishing returns now quite frankly we
should get blown out by this microbe
um that's that's fully what i expect to
happen at least
instead we draw i think once their
turtle gets leveled up like that's a
easy loss but
lucky us for now
rabbit you you really like had your
chance and i i think you have helped us
i mean again whereas six wins i'm not
gonna like cry about it or whatever but
we do need a little bit more i think you
freeze a deer as a just in case me uh on
round 11 we're gonna lose our melon
armor man
um
if we buy a cow i should say but i'm
gonna do it i'm gonna do this
and then i'm gonna get a cow
and then i'm gonna buff you
and it sucks we couldn't keep our we
couldn't get the deer involved but this
is actually still pretty good 2937
garlic armor
looks okay
looks okay man
somehow we we're barely like
we're pushing we're grinding up this
hill i don't know if we're gonna get
there um but we're doing okay
you can definitely sell a cow i'm
keeping the okay now the scorpion is
basically just in my opinion a better
deer so we're gonna freeze that
i will sell
bye
yeah okay
uh we don't necessarily need to keep the
hatching check but i'm going to
although
we could you know what okay for this
round
don't desync me
what two dragons though man
i have a play
for this round
i hope we live
this is how it's gonna go okay this
round
scorpion i mean you see the squad full
stop next time we sell hatching chick we
sell scorpion we sell swan we buy two
dragons and start cycling ones out there
everybody's going to
getting stronger
okay no no no don't don't desync me
don't desync me i we we have a master
level play a gary kasparov style tactic
all we need to do is live through this
round
this doesn't look too bad
this doesn't look bad at all i think
we're gonna make it i think that's all i
ever could ask for is a chance to try
this strange strategy that is an
incredible late game pivot but could
anything could happen here that's eight
wins
it did not look like we were going to be
in the running here you're gone
you're gone
you're gone but thank you so much
you're here
you're here
and now the fun begins
oh my god
it just looks hilarious
i don't even know if we're getting that
that's static it's just very funny to
see
we'd really like to see a pig
i mean this is still pretty sweet
and don't sleep on the dragons man we've
done some great work for our dragons
here
would you would you rather buff
everything by one or buff yeah okay
you're that's
honest wait you know what no no i think
i'd rather
i think i'd rather buff everything by
one
don't really need to level up our dog
now he's almost static but okay i have
no idea if this is gonna get us there
but it's it's pretty good we just want
to see i don't know no mid mid squad
scorpions
that's incredibly good luck that our
mosquito got hit
i'm not thrilled seeing that you got a
24-27 rooster out there that's actually
oh my god okay so we lose but we had a
lot of fun
there's eight wins
not bad not bad let's run it back here i
like it i would roll it i would like it
this is just a nice squad i think it
still loses um
be the motherly warriors
um
i think it still loses to a good ants
like mosquito build maybe okay well
let's find out
we draw these
no we win these i can't do basic
arithmetic
that's not true i can do basic
arithmetic i just can't interpret a
situation into a mathematical context
easily
but you already knew that
i absolutely think you can roll a
mosquito here and combine but i think
instead we're just gonna do
this and then we actually for three gold
we basically are gonna buff the hp of
whatever unit we create probably you
look i could be wrong it would not be
the first time
i'm still not a believer in the horse
cricket build
it's just like it's so consistently and
this is like pretty close to the dream
considering how much gold you get early
like you can't have bees on everything
to start with like it just loses to
units that are good i know i've said it
a thousand times but
i think we freeze you
i always like i'm gonna keep you around
sonofa
we're gonna end up rolling a four squad
marty okay
and i think the way that we're gonna do
it
is we're going to
buff you i don't these are not my ideal
enemies just for my my ideal uh
units just for the record but
i think we're going to try something
like this this looks so unimpressive
okay so for us to win i think we need to
be able to uh
we're gonna lose uh the sheeps are just
gonna be too strong the spider's
spitting out sheeps that's what happened
there right the spider spitting out
sheeps is just like
by the way can we just talk about how we
just lost to a summon build that doesn't
have a horse i'm not saying you can
never roll summon builds i'm just saying
don't roll a horse unless you hate
winning
now i think you can feed this creature
here
which makes our bat much stronger at 1-4
why not
um
and our fish is not long for this world
the bat is kind of around for the long
haul so i'm just gonna feed the bat give
it a little extra hp put the bat up at
the front man i don't really care as
long as it gets its effect out there
that's the only thing that really
matters
we wanted to overrun
uh a piece of equipment
couldn't have been better honestly
it basically could not have been a
stronger play for us you can't look i
understand
for every two hours we play this game we
lose the horses once and then people go
but you lost the horses yesterday yeah
but our win rate is like you know 90
percent
it's just uh it's it's not it's not
viable man so our hedgehog and our fish
are both not long for this world we
didn't really try to make the hedgehog
work but
now swan
i'll be straight up with you i think the
best time to pivot on this is right now
we lose one attack that's pretty minor
straight up equipment will win you some
rounds here let's do something like this
i'm gonna freeze a turtle and i'm gonna
buff our beetle
um now we got you know a two-six turtle
that could actually be like if you add
meat on that that could be kind of a
functional addition to a to a win now
type of squad
didn't quite get the job done there we
really got a punch through we're not
gonna i think you know what actually our
b is gonna let us kill i think this is a
draw never mind we win
people will look at this squad and say
like it's kind of underwhelming and
you're definitely right
sort of
um
the thing that makes it better and we
just don't have anything at scale so
it's really tough to take you honestly
the thing that makes it better than
underwhelming
sure
can i can i try something here
i'm gonna try the thing that makes it
better than underwhelming i'm still
keeping you around as well
is merely that um
you know equipment is overpowered like
this is not a five-five it's basically a
six-five that has an awesome effect
um
and then you know the same our swan is
basically uh a 10-6 like we we got lots
of good stuff going on here
i am willing by the way to to sacrifice
where i mean we're going to lose this
round for sure but i'm willing to
sacrifice a little
forward momentum in order to get this
llama scale and hopefully help us out in
the future
we got a nice little flex position i
mean that's a no-brainer buy that's like
a gimme
swan giving us some extra economics you
love to see it the problem that we have
right now is that the beetle
is good
but
we it's not going to scale into the late
game so we really want to
maybe get like mel and armor out here
for our llama but we can also if we just
get a pill we could just create melon
armor i guess we don't need to get any
any more complicated than that or
alternatively we don't even need to
create melon armor we could just give
you garlic instead
garlic day hold on two four you're four
two one two
four it it's tough to see how the poodle
would fit in here unfortunately
i'm gonna freeze garlic that's a just in
case freeze on round seven i actually
really like this squad and i like our
stats
we're going to run into a really tough
time here
never
mind we're actually going to win
i've played ll a few times for sure
now i'm hoping we've gotten like over
the hump with the llama
it's very tempting
i mean you have to like this swan
getting a level three is so valuable and
then at least we get a random pair for
the cost of two gold because you
you sell it back that's pretty good eats
i would say nothing here really fits the
bill at the the the problem is i've
already explained at some point we
basically gotta dump you
a hatching chick is more of like it fits
in a five squat i'm not sure about a
four squad which is to say i don't think
it can really work let's give you a
temporary buff which will also make this
turtle stronger if we ever choose to put
it out there um
i honestly think llama at the front
might be the play you know if we start
running into hippos or something like
that we'll be happy
you peace
[Laughter]
it's okay we chunk through in two and
the rest of the squad is like it's made
of tissue paper man look at this okay so
we're still winning man
stay winning i mean this is new to me
like a llama squad having a chance this
is new to me
you know it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world to get another llama just
saying
this is interesting like a chicken and
then just buying tier ones for like can
benefits but
we we have capacity open
it's possible this may work
that seems important
we are definitely early enough
that if you could get a leopard to scale
i'm gonna get rid of you like thanks for
being here i really have enjoyed having
you as like a hedge
um
if we could get a leopard to scale man
i'm gonna try because at this point it's
just
it's just wild let's give it a shot
right like we got lives to play with
let's have some fun so we're gonna sell
the beetle although to be honest with
you we could sell the bat probably as
well um we're gonna buy a leopard
we're going to buy a cow and use the cow
to buff the leopard which is not the
game theory play the game theory play
would be
um to buff the llama because it has
garlic and it like is our best unit but
this at least
makes our leopard better in the future
we will also i mean really i'm gonna
freeze this but the best play is garlic
on your leopard i think to at least give
it the chance to to do some damage as
well eventually we want like a level two
leopard with a tiger behind it and then
we'll see how the how the world strikes
us man
so this is really bad
i mean we're going up against golden
poop man would you expect lobster it's
legendary chatter and you know what i
respect your squad let me tell you
not just cause you beat me but that is
not a typical squad
that's uh that's a a lot of fun
congratulations
you that's a big win well you know what
we are on lethal it's scary but we do
have a level two leopard come on man
don't don't put me out of my misery yet
i'm having a great time we're one tiger
away from this leopard really popping
it didn't kill anything
which is kind of bad
hold on we're going up against horses
we're gonna lose
i'm upset
you need those leopards to show up a
little earlier okay i i'm gonna do like
a speed run okay i got enough time for a
speed run i would really love to try to
make a hedgehog build work let's be the
i'll be a danish geek
why not
it
there's two different possible uh
interpretations that could be
a geek from denmark or it could be
somebody who's really into sweet
pastries
easy squad easy squad
i mean i'm not really i don't really
want to buff you long term but that's
okay okay speed run strat speed run
strats man one day the leopards are
gonna are gonna rule the world
it's not today
this is really bad we lost the ant luck
there but that you know what it i i win
with and luck like a lot of the time so
i'm who am i to insult it
give me a combine give me a combine
again we're going a little speedy it's
an always take it's an always take in my
world we should have buffed you first
with a little bit of meat because we
don't really care to get a one-four
ladybug long-term but
i really think the swan
is like it's a unit you can shove into
every squad shows up early
shows up often
does great work
let's go we got a ant difference there
and difference isn't there like a super
speed now too
we gotta check out the new super speed
mechanic
i think you absolutely have to roll a
dog i know i do it every time man woof
freak around find out okay one of these
yeah dogs getting stronger give me uh
honestly toss me a little rat up at the
front
what do we have two wins one life down
the new meta it's changing everything i
think
okay very bad we're not even gonna
summon a rat
this is a loss man like look at this
squad is this squad is decked out
there's this that's a turn three squad
i don't believe oh turn four okay turn
four
now what do you when you say it like
that okay turn four maybe
you know what welcome to the squad we're
about to go full meme build
and i'll do it again
dude you could totally fit this hold on
two one two
if you're gonna play with your lives you
should play with them now so dog and
swan are both gonna stick around
honestly either of them getting buffed
is fine but i think you could make a
case for buffing the swan
no don't
you need to buy a poodle
so we will
poodle's gonna buff itself buff buff
not buff nut buff i respect all of this
i respect every single one of these give
me a turtle is a tier three we could
totally start stacking buffs on that or
on a blowfish but i think i think a
turtle with some buffs attached to it
can do some serious work now i don't
mind if we lose this one because we
we've invested in our future okay we're
gonna run into some serious problems
[Laughter]
as a strong hippo but i i think we got
good prospects for our future we don't
sweat those losses as much now
now um
we can we we know you've got to go
unfortunately we can buy you hope we get
a nice buff off it
it's pretty good actually straight up as
much as i would love a turtle to get
stronger for the time being i think we
can totally just give some melon armor
to our swan
buy another one to help out our dog
freeze me roll me
that's a
we're probably going to dump you at some
point keep you
which means you could freeze this to
keep buffing your dog we could also peel
the turtle to give the dog some armor i
don't know let's
uh hold on we have three gold what am i
doing
um
you should buff the dog even though this
would buff the units in the shop the the
dog is gonna need it because it's the
only thing not getting a buff right now
from the poodle
i think maybe equipment could let us
live long enough to get
the rest of our run to pop
i don't know that for a fact but
as a situation where garlic would be
much better but we're still going to
come through just fine
i know i said i was going to do a speed
run but you know life comes at you fast
but actually we're pretty close to death
this could be an unintentional speed run
uh for now um
this does not help our dog you know what
for now
now you can fit a rhino in
you definitely should have bought the
dog first but
i don't think a rhino is particularly
good
but it exists and is taking a buff here
maybe just maybe i'm telling you man i'm
telling you we get some equipment going
this thing could this thing could do
some work
our squad setup is all it's all busted
it does not look good
you know what though this looks great
hold on are we are we starting to pull
ourselves out of the doldrums
four wins
maybe yes maybe no you kind of gotta go
you're our next like
honestly if we're gonna do it we should
do it right away
that's a buy as a cell
life goes on you could definitely fit
but garlic on you is so important you
could fit a deer in here
this is now what you have to do
um
the swan's still stealing buffs which we
like freeze me
roll me and by roll me i mean use me
freeze me okay all right all right all
right okay we're still two away from
lethal no matter what
our deer oh a deer doesn't get buffed
because of the poodle which is good
actually seven seven duck what the heck
is this allowed
huge and then we shoot the melon armor
off of you and then we trade with you
that's amazing
that's like when the moon hits your eye
like a big pizza pie the rhino is only a
sometimes animal but
hey that's that takes us to five
with a pretty good upshot i think for
our future here like we like it
welcome
we like it
welcome
we like it
welcome
we like it
[Laughter]
i don't know it's maybe a little much
but uh you know what sure now we got a
sauropod on the squad as well
with one extra gold which makes sense
because we bought ours
maybe it doesn't make sense at all
freeze me just in case
lots of buffs coming out here the dog is
doing okay in its own right on turn nine
feeling a little weak but you know i've
been wrong before
that's probably big
i have to imagine this is looking pretty
solid
you kidding me man what is this we got
six six wins out of this
not really this the kind of speed run i
promised you but
beautiful now are we going to dump a
sauropod
yes
[Laughter]
i think it kind of has to be done
similarly like a goat doesn't fit just
because we're like so attached to the
squad we already got
okay well i mean there's some gimmies
here i think uh it would be nice if our
poodle scaled twice as much now as it's
wishful thinking but
freeze me just in case and freeze me
just in case um
why oh cause the cow is a level five and
stila they stole it right now buff
this is good dude dude
it's actually not that good but it's not
that bad
because we destroy you then you get the
melon armor then we destroy your melon
armor now it doesn't do
everything that i needed it to do but
it's certainly not bad
and would you look at that we're kind of
chunking through here with the extra
economics of our swan it takes us to
seven wins
this is very big
now this is what i was thinking of it it
worked so well like we could rework our
whole squad we could put a buffalo in
here a dragon i just don't think we have
the time
i wish that we did
i just don't think we got the time
we could buy sell
but i think getting the a better chance
of the right unit
is better than just
getting a buff did we get the right unit
no not at all
not not at all like literally zero
percent but
we'll just keep that for now nobody
needs to know and now the dog stole a
buff that's called i should have gotten
my other dog but i still think it might
be worth that cost for the positioning
oh my god we're going to kill their
scorpion no we're just going to hit
their scorpion
uh whatever i think we still win
dude we're kind of cruising this is
where you in the comments you go what is
this team why can't i play these teams
i don't know what to tell you
i don't know what to tell you
kind of cruising though i think i think
we like this
i think we like this
straight up i think you can absolutely
just roll
um
four melon armors is just disgusting by
the way i think you could just roll a
second poodle for now so if you're gonna
do that you might as well do
this just make sure that the right
poodle is being buffed
i'm a sucker for these buffs what can i
say
not great not a great situation
oh but the math is not as bad as i
thought it would be
it's also not as good as i thought it
would be but look at this dude double
poodle build and now somehow we're one
away from total fruition
and yet we got a little room to play
with who would have thought
we don't necessarily need to do combines
quite frankly if we if we like our
double poodle build
i wish i could just like sequester you
you know just get get over there okay
you're doing your part i respect and
appreciate that why did i buy a dog
great question frieza hatching chick
it's a great uh unit to play right now
dude we really level two rhino is so
much better than level one rhino like
it's not even freaking close
right now the rhino's kind of sick at
cracking melon armors but
that's about it
interesting
we win these
dude we're actually we just got 10 wins
new meta old meta meet the new meta same
as the old meta oh look at that squad
who would have thought you know it it
looks unimpressive but melon armor
basically is like i mean it kind of
turns your unit into a rooster
that feels good for now thanks for
watching glad we did a speed run hey get
out of there and i'll see you next time
see you



all right we are back the rumors of my
demise have been greatly exaggerated we
were playing super auto pets i did
manage to play and record a little bit
yesterday so i am familiar with the
patch okay
for anybody that's watching on stream
right now that is not familiar with the
patch
basically the the big change as we as we
run bets here in the casino um the big
change is that instead of four hp and
you lose one every time you lose a round
you have 10 hp
early rounds you lose one if you lose
mid rounds you lose two
late rounds you lose three so
you can afford to lose
without being upset earlier
uh you can also scale you can invest in
your scaling a little more i think um
i think it's really i think it's
modified uh some of the animals i don't
exactly know like how i feel about it
yet but i certainly think it has
modified some of the some of the animals
i think duck is like plausible i think
uh
horse is still garbage every time i run
into a horse i still like crush him and
i i feel like to be honest it's been a
lot harder to get to 10 wins now
i mean i'll be straight up with you i
think you can you can play a mosquito i
think you can freeze a duck
and two ducks is is much better than one
let's let's give it a try immediately
here
be the
the foamy fireman
why not let's give it a shot
horse is even worse now
well you know what if we actually win or
draw this one okay we're gonna lose
it shows you that doug's still a little
bit stinky for winning rounds but for
scaling they got it going on man so
we're going to keep these two ducks
until we tear up
on our next level holy bursh okay
we're not going to keep that fish around
we'll keep you around
so what we want to see here is like
we're on free to play let me okay we're
probably gonna lose this round too but a
loss here
puts us on uh
two hp down which is honestly again like
that's the same as losing a round
from this point onwards like now you
start to lose two hp to begin with so
it uh
it's not that bad
now
here we go okay
we wanna see the best tier three animal
for where we're at
the best tier three animal for where
we're at right now
is kangaroo tier three i would love to
see a kangaroo pop up right now
honestly i think you could say something
about the whale
i think you could get a 4 8 whale have
it eat something and and be pretty
chunky i'm a big believer in this
eight hp is something that's really
tough to deal with
so let's put a let's put a whale out
here
honestly i mean like it's not really a
3-4 cricket
but i think you can roll a cricket out
here at least it has something with a
whale
and then i think you can probably feed
your whale a little bit hp now it's not
a dynamite squad we got some work to do
but i do think that uh
a five okay but wait what the heck
that's the same team
they got the same idea
but they got an elephant kicker man
i feel like
we definitely just lose this one okay
that's not great they're us but stronger
now winning now would be nice
i don't know how deep we want to go in
the duck meta
i i'm a little frightened um i don't
think we can make a dodo work here we
really want to see a mosquito
i can take a swan it's like the best uh
animal in the game i think i can sell
our 4-4 beaver for the stats
that's pretty nice
um
you know we could roll a threes okay
hold on this would take us
[Laughter]
as a random apple basically i say no
give me the
spider buff my
whale it's a little unusual but we're
sticking to base level principles
this is not amazing
let's see no snails no snails baby
maybe like a turtle would be kind of
sick
kangaroo that's basically a snail uh
where we stand but that's fine maybe a
little uh turtle now a little snail okay
little snail never hurt anybody
this looks like a draw we're starting to
work our way out of there
i can take it a draw with no scaling
straight up man this is a big play okay
we're gonna get rid of our uh
we're gonna get rid of our 3-3 mosquito
we're going to get a 13 hp crab
we're going to put some meats on it
throw some meats on it
just bought a cadillac yeah we lose
three hp now so like this is this is
where things get a little tight
i would definitely purchase another swan
i'm not sure i'm willing to get rid of
that cricket for it
roll me one more time
you know i i feel like a turtle with our
whale here could do some great work if
we make it out of this round things are
gonna do some good stuff although now
i'm realizing turtle whale is not that
amazing for us because turtle whale um
will cause depending on positioning
will cause us to override the meat on
the crab
no turtle no turtle okay let's go we
actually won around let's go
surf and turf meta exactly surf and turf
meta so i would say for now
um
forget a turtle
give me some garlic
sell my cricket double up on a swan
for the time being
look freeze me freeze me
depends how confident you are
if you're if you're confident
my long-term play
is well my my next term play
is
combine swans buy turtle pill turtle in
front of swan because they're sticking
around my short term play we don't have
the gold necessary to make that work and
still run a full squad
do we feel comfortable you know what i
feel comfortable doing
combining
buy me
sell me
and now we got a three five turtle just
chilling there
give it a shot
give it a shot temporary duck meta
okay now i see we got a nasty bat here
got a nasty blow fish after the blowfish
though this squad is is pretty garbage
but then again like after my uh crab my
squad is garbage so you can see how i
might be a little conflicted there we
come out with the draw
come on come on
just need our engine we're not quite
there yet we just need our engine
i think we do like the the melon armor
on the cheap none of these appeal to me
roll me we really want to see a deer
honestly i think for now you could do a
lot worse than a dolphin and i i hate to
say it but we're gonna keep
buffing
this whale because it's like our only
chance of success
i'm a little scared please shoot the
horse it's going to shoot the deer it's
going to shoot the bunny of all the
things you could have shot that would
have given me like extreme benefits
that's terrible news hold on i still
feel like we're doing okay
what do we get there a little spider
that's right that makes perfect sense
because that's how it works um we win
these we win these holy crap
it had to shoot the bunny i thought the
deer had the same hp
i might be mistaken but i thought the
deer had the same hp
okay
straight up like we could even just use
the whale as like a chunk right now just
at the front but
we know we need to buy this so i think
for for the time being
i honestly think our spider is ass so
like i think i'd rather have the dolphin
he's gonna he's gonna be like our
anti-scorpion tech i guess
but also he's gonna be our best unit
now you can definitely fit a kangaroo
behind your crab
i'm just hoping we get like a deer
instead i mean you could roll like a
you can roll a skunk i guess if you're
if you're that ballsy
i don't think you can roll a bunny this
late okay you know what
for the time being
it's a little wonky
it's a little wonky for sure but we'll
just this squad is like in transition
right now
you know we're on our way to making
something good happen i i think we're
them but stronger
we're them but stronger okay there we go
viewer build hey we won
don't be rude we won okay now with the
squad chunking as it's chunking right
now you love a scorpion
but you
i don't know a whale eating a scorpion
is kind of just funny
it's not good but it's basically like
placing a scorpion
second but by surprise
[Laughter]
oh it's true it'd get buffed by the
monkey it's not a great play our shops
have been a little spicy so far i still
got hope though
no it comes back with the peanuts man it
comes back with the peanuts
source dude just trust me
i'm gonna roll though nothing nothing
here strikes me as appealing that much
i'm gonna double up on our dolphin i
think this could take some people by
surprise there's a lot of like sniping
is kind of is kind of chunking in the
current meta
i'm gonna give you a little hp and roll
once
i'm gonna buff our swan like a level
three swan would be pretty sick hello
wow look at this outfit
hello honey
you peace
is that what you're saying you peace
she comes in the person
holy birsh
okay i'm gonna stop teaching her that
do you see a bird
hello
can we can we do the chat iq test again
where is your nose
where is your head
where is the eyeball
where's where's your eye
good job
where's the light
that's right where's ruka where's ruka
it's tough it's kind of tricky right
where's ruka
he's normally in the cat tree but right
now okay that's good
ear
she's doing it nope
okay
we're on the believer threshold hold on
this hold on man
we got something here okay i think you
sell the monkey
though it pains me because i think it's
really good if the whale's sticking the
monkey is like anti-whale tech
hello
we're gonna buy some milk
oh the cow goes um
damn we're gonna toss this in here
that's
it's just chaos man it's just chaos
don't hit the deer okay you're a piece
hello
she's giving me like a shoulder rub like
it's gonna be okay
even if this run doesn't work you're
gonna be okay yo the the dolphin snipe
on the kangaroo was insane
that's so huge
holy crap we're making it
five wins
considering how like weird our shops
have been this is actually like kind of
uh like this is a blessing you got a
choice here i think you get a level two
whale
normally i would not take that but i
think a level two whale is the way to go
here to get even more splash damage
purge up some melon armors
feel good about it
i would love a level two dolphin and
then level three swan is probably next
i still love our swan here i but i do i
like the idea of taking a a cat
i'm gonna freeze it for the time being
because what i would really like to do
is get like a leopard going okay bye bye
okay this changes everything
i think
you can um
you almost have to get a rooster
to get out of this like the ru the
rooster i have to admit is like
probably
it's probably like the best animal in
the game right now
but i'm just trying to see like the
people are like dump the crab no no no
the crabs sticking around what we would
probably do is dump dolphin swan for now
we don't really need the whale to eat it
because it's kind of garbage
like we could sell dolphin sell swan
and then invest as much food as possible
into this rooster and then put a tiger
behind it
it does take a lot of investment right
now you know what i'm gonna do
i'm gonna i'm gonna slow my roll i'm
gonna do some
pretty garbage rolls with the half the
shop frozen
i'm going to sell
i'm going to sell
i'm going to buy
i'm gonna buy we're gonna do it in a
it's gonna be another transition game
buy some pizzas
i have absolutely no complaints about
how that went
uh next turn we will i honestly think
you can sell your deer
and then just roll the whale at the
front as if it was like an uh a fish or
something like that and then
get this out here and start feeding it
feeding it sushi sushi lettuce lettuce
oh yeah that's right you know you get
the idea
just give it a say this is a big round
for us we're going up against the
rooster
it feels good feels bad
feels good 10 10 not bad
you got two of those though that's
pretty nasty okay we lose this for sure
so it's gonna we're gonna be in a lethal
range
but i'm telling you big rooster with
melon on it could do some serious work
the thing is i know people are like have
the whale eat it
when it i guess my question this is
normally i don't uh
i don't question
this too much
but
when the whale eats the rooster and it
spits it out it's gonna come out with
base stats which is unacceptable so i
actually think the way we do this is i
trust my gut
we sell a crab though it pains me a
great deal we buy you
you're gonna be a nine nine
it's just actually not that
impressive um like at all
i need to see a tiger oh
okay
now i'm not saying no this looks pretty
bad
probably should have frozen this as well
but i was i was too hyped
okay we're gonna break the i mean how
are you gonna kill 2 45 46s the answer
is you're not
yeah it's not possible
yeah tiger whale might have been
stronger there
why does this man like deer so much it's
literally probably the first time we've
rolled a deer in like the last 20
matches we'll pay out the doubters on
that one
the thing is you know you got to pay you
got to play the cards you're dealt on
the
on the super auto pets games
you know you don't always have 100
control over what shows up in your shops
but i see you i i know i i see you out
there you're the kind of person i get to
round nine i see fly tiger turkey and i
say okay i get it you just hate fun
we'll run it back
okay this is a little bit more
acceptable keep in mind we did lose a
lot of games early
just due to uh rolling ducks
maybe the suave
i there should be like a rename
for one gold you should be able to
reroll your name
casino it it's running um as we speak
as we speak it is running hello squeeze
me
2 three
two two maybe if she's five foot two
okay okay sure okay yeah all right um
i would say give me a
three four freeze a mosquito just in
case
next time we'll level up this time we're
gonna get a kangaroo
it's a pretty nasty we definitely lose
these
dude our team was pretty good there to
lose that one hurts
okay toss me
dude actually i i truly believe an ox
can win you
like seven rounds in the middle
and i'll just get a lozenge
i'm telling you the occasional throat
clearing is much better
than hearing this for the whole stream
we're just in like permanent uh our kid
gets sick
we get a little sick they get better
we have kind of like a permanent just
like a little phlegm
just a little phlegm
and then she goes she's gonna have like
three days off from daycare we're all
gonna get better then she's gonna go
back to daycare she's gonna you know get
a little bit of a cough we're gonna be
like we can't get it this time she's
gonna give it back to us
no wonder my dad was buying cough drops
like every time we went to the grocery
store when i was a kid
i do i do feel like i'm rebuilding the
blueprint of my immune system after two
years inside though so i think it's a
good thing honestly
um
straight up though ox good enough
so you take an ox
we got seven gold
we pill the mosquito in front of the ox
i didn't sell the duck first
so this whoever told me whoever told me
to have a lozenge and gummy stun locked
you're on notice
sorry we can sell it next round this is
still like pretty good
i would sell
if it hits the duck it hits the duck
that's life man didn't hit the duck
never a doubt in my mind freeze a crab
as a just in case
and you know what i'll i'll throw a
little hedgehog back here i actually i
kind of like the idea of a hedgehog
in front of our ox which will kill our
melon armor
and then give us new melon armor which
is just
just funky i've been trying to make
these these like whale hedgehog builds
work whenever they show up i got no
promises i do think ours you know it
seems like we do pretty well with a
hedgehog here
we definitely win this one
i think the mid game is really important
now because losses basically count for
double
um
so i think this is a nice sell
i think you're always gonna freeze a
pill
knowing that you could pill something
uh and and buff the ox a little bit
instead of selling it but
it has to be the right thing obviously
hey
mcbreen thanks for the gifted
subscriptions much appreciated
thank you
i don't know what the heck we're doing
here
we're not doing a buy me sell me you
don't really run dodo here i'm rolling
like a madman but i'm not
really getting what i want to get
i think i have to detach myself from the
the hedgehog
that being said uh i love him
so yes i will buy an otter for a random
plus one plus one buff i think we got a
little lucky with how it worked out
we want meat on our crab
we have space for another pill in the
future okay yeah
hey bring me thanos thank you as well
thank you
don't sweat the hedgehog look a hedgehog
would have freaking crushed here by the
way not that i necessarily think it's
completely necessary but
a hedgehog would have freaking slapped
here um
but we can always get the hedgehog back
we're only one gold away from it you
know like it's just i don't i know that
this is at this point you're probably
sick of hearing it you know yes like
i've seen people be like i agree horse
is bad because it's only good with
crickets no
horse is bad because even with that was
like two crickets with bees an ant with
bees two horses and it still got his ass
beat like it wasn't even close
even in like the ideal circumstance
i don't buy it i just i i don't i don't
believe in its power
lord forgive me you're gonna
you know what hold on hold on
unfreeze this get me out of here give me
to the crab
badger at the front aux behind
now we're freaking talking
the badger might trade if it doesn't
trade it's gonna pop and pop it's gonna
kill you we're gonna get our melon armor
back and we're gonna buff yourself
show me what you're working with
maybe i do need a lozenge
there's just like one piece of
dead mucus in there
you gotta you gotta hit it with
ultrasound like um
when you're trying to break up a kidney
stone
okay hold on that actually that helped
out a lot i do have a headache though
after doing that
[Laughter]
um
just kidding it's gone but i do feel
like i was just in an earthquake i
will
i i think that the fish is not long for
this world but i don't really want to
replace anything
well you know what we could sell
and then buy
uh a giraffe just to get like an apple
for a turn or two and then apply it to
our swan some people may say crabs are
better play i'm like a i'm a swan based
gamer
this looks pretty good
this looks really good
it at least broke your melon which
leaves lets us trade with you
my badger is better
my badger's better
okay that's three wins we got a round
one loss no big deal
now i would say
you you can start to think about rolling
a kangaroo but it's not really like the
right like honestly the crab might not
be long for this world
just because we don't have like a super
good unit with respect to hp it's really
hard to like
orient these properly
like the crab
steals two hp right now not a big deal
we wanted to steal seven but then if a
steal seven maybe it's getting buffed
instead of the swan
which you could do
but
i suppose you could do this but i don't
know i don't see our ox being part of
our late game that might be the way to
play it for now though
there is the idea of a hedgehog fitting
in here is kind of funny
for now i'm gonna you know what a level
two giraffe actually might solve some of
our problems
no promises on that one
but it it may be possible and genuinely
i believe you
buff the otter now let me just run this
through because this is new okay this is
new for me
you're gonna die you're gonna purge our
melon armor we're gonna get buffed we're
gonna be a six six otter this is it's
kind of like a garbage order when you
think about it
uh giraffe is going to buff you you're
going to die this one's going to be
you're going to be a 3-7 it's like an a7
okay okay
no
yeah it's like an 8-7 that's not so bad
all right this is this is certainly
interesting
this seems very good for me
dude the
actual like badger technology is kind of
sick now we're still gonna lose because
of the kangaroo but this let's
with so many people stacking up their
strong units at the front
this is like
this badger tech is gonna work man it's
gonna work
now i hate to say it
dude honestly get out of my face you're
not you're you're screwing up the squad
now i might i kind of want to garlic you
honestly
because i feel like why not have you
still be garlic it's not like you're
getting eaten for sure right off the bat
i was looking for a pill this is what i
was looking for
because now i can peel you instead of
selling you
and then i i see a man this is gonna be
sick but now i'm like
hold on
hold on man
what if i ran double badger
hey we got lives to play with let's
toss one out here
you're gonna live yeah yeah yeah roll me
once oh baby
okay
this is this is gonna do something man
this is gonna do something beefy one
first so they both trigger that's
exactly what i want not to happen
okay this looks kind of sick
we draw these i'll take i'll take that
draw honestly i'll take that draw
then you're gonna combine me you're
gonna do double damage to the unit up
front which is gonna be like an absurd
overkill much of the time
i think you can totally fit a dolphin
into like any squad
but you know what people have been
really going off on the skunk lately
what if we give this skunk a chance
so this thing when it dies it's an 11 9
garlic armor when it
dies going to do 22 damage okay hold on
we got a problem it's actually getting
to the point where it's going to do more
damage than the melon armor will survive
but the the ox will still live i don't
mind if the ox takes a little damage
as long as it definitely kills
everything around it
and look it's go well
i mean that actually this could not have
gone better really
we just got to make sure we're buffing
the ox as well
somehow
[Laughter]
oh yeah because we're still getting like
one hp every turn from the giraffe right
now but
camilla
not sold on it not sold on it
okay you know what
seems helpful
i think you're right actually a gorilla
instead of an ox as long as the gorilla
had melon armor first so it survived
this 22 hit salvo would be would be kind
of sick
it'd be kind of sick tech
i'm gonna keep the skunk for now
it worked for us in the last round so
i'm gonna you know we're still learning
about it
holy crap
um
i mean this is i'm gonna dance with the
one that brought me for now
i don't necessarily believe in this
squad
but
it's hard not to when stuff like that
happens okay that's pretty sick we win
is that a believer payout
no we're one away okay
i mean we could get level three bison
that's pretty sick i love the i don't
know level three badger kind of scares
the crap out of me
you could you could go level two giraffe
if you're gonna keep it
that way you would buff the badger but i
don't know the badger like scares the
crap out of me like the every time we
give the badger one damage
it's gonna do two damage like we're
we're like out scaling our own unit in
the middle so i think you go swan or
or ox
i don't know let's go ox just just fun
um what about a tiger behind a swan is
that something that's ever happened
tiger badger
dude i don't know about that
i did like i'm just i'm playing the tape
forward
i don't know maybe okay hold on
i'm sorry ripped to the believers but
i'm an innovator okay
okay so here's here's my thought process
okay
you're gonna get hit at some point
you're gonna die you're gonna do 2x
damage to adjacent pets
you're gonna kill me you're gonna kill
this unit then you're gonna do it again
which will purge my melon armor but then
we'll get our melon armor back
one or two times
i don't know like look we got two lives
let's let's give it a shot
this could be fun
holy
it's actually incredible
[Laughter]
i don't know if it's incredible but it
works at least
okay i know you're gonna say we and the
skunk has been so good for us we we we
can't really afford to dump it we really
want to level it up we can't go level
three because it will kill our ox which
is like the only unit that matters we
can afford to get rid of you
i know that we got a giraffe so like we
could buff you but the buffed giraffe is
kind of like it's kind of due to tear
the gorilla is interesting the problem
is
that the gorilla
wait no you're absolutely right hold on
why don't we just put the skunk here who
cares if it dies
and then swing for the fences
yeah yeah yeah now now we'll buff our
badger up
we're just going to keep rolling the
roll is very important here
i don't know it's hard for me to imagine
a world where melon doesn't play like a
role
i think we could sell our giraffe
because like if we lose the next round
that's
way too much frozen but if we lose our
next round
we're going to
want to sell the giraffe for some
desperation
this
this could do something man what the
heck died or tiger
how dare you
out there okay so we lost that
good the splash damage roasted us there
so you know if anything
we actually so you're gone
we probably need melon on our tiger or a
mushroom but we can't rely on a mushroom
necessarily showing up get a nice juicy
buff
i'm gonna say i mean you could roll a
scorpion up at the front
and then buff your badger i know this
looks a little strange but
this is it you know what is new meta new
meta
it starts out pretty amazing i think
that that couldn't have gone too much
better
uh what the heck
we draw these
did we get two plays out of our badger
there or because the badger killed the
tiger on his first hit it didn't do it
we did we did okay if we did then i'm
okay
no well you know what
no no no you can't you you don't one-up
the badger okay because like a one up on
the badger it comes back as a one one it
does three damage to everything you know
it purges melon armor but that's about
it
as long as the tiger has melon i'm okay
with that that's totally fine
i would say we no longer have to freeze
a dolphin
i mean i'll level with you we could
possibly roll two scorpions our skunk
has been good for us i would hate to say
bye-bye do whatever
oh a second tiger has no value but
i i think you can sell a skunk roll two
scorpions and then cupcake i don't know
are you gonna wait a minute wait a
minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
because you're going to do 60 damn
you're going to kill me you're going to
no no okay now i've made a terrible
mistake we got to put a scorpion here
just uh just to make some space
oh man we had to put a buffer there all
right all right what the heck melon
scorpion
we lived oh cause it had melon of course
of course we wow
what oh no i did
i'm so stupid
i'm so stupid we draw these no we lose
these we draw these we lose these
i i didn't put the tiger on the badger i
needed to put the scorpion in front of
the ox
okay okay we do whatever we paid out the
believers let's run dude that was like
the most fun super auto pets run i have
had in a long time that was great
oh
man
okay run it back start the prediction we
now that we know that that can work we
can do it even better what did we learn
in particular
what the heck
what did we learn in particular what i
felt like we learned in particular was
that um
i think ox is just like a mid-game
superstar
i think if you see an ox you can be like
sure
i think you can be happy to take it
honestly
the extra eyes it's kind of a sick name
i don't want to know what they make the
salty ice cubes out of this is a loss
it's just a nasty team
you know
i'll buy one of these don't don't buff
my duck or i'll
i'm a sick frick i like a quick frick um
so you're gonna level up that's big i
love that you're gonna level up and i
love that you love that you're gonna
level up we're gonna put you at the back
we're gonna freeze pardon me we're gonna
freeze you
now we're talking
shoot some ants
we will not be shooting any ants today
that's unfortunate
that's unfortunate yeah this is a loss
[Laughter]
that's fine whatever so instead of
losing 50 of our hp for losing the first
two games we lose 20 percent it's
actually like such a huge change
we know we're going to want to swan
this is amazing this is incredible so
we're going to sell a duck
we're gonna continue trying our ox plays
we're gonna roll a swan onto the squad
and we're gonna fish for a little bit of
a pel
i swear you're just like a pel instead
of making me better you're making me l
i like an ox close to the end because i
think that like that's where they tend
to have less gas
question mark it's that's a song by pink
did you know pink was the best-selling
female artist of
the decade known as the 2000s that
kind of crazy
because like she's kind of like
bad no not blackpink
although i guess you know what to be
honest blackpink might have a chance at
the 2020s for all i know
if they keep making a
that's my new arc is cultivating the uh
the the love of the k-pop stands
i need i need an ally on my side
i'm not gonna buy the otter what about
island boy i would welcome the island
boys and let me get an island boy
let me get an island boy
so i'm not going to buy the otter
because it's
three gold for a 1-1 what i will do is
pill an otter
in front of an ox
now we got a four or five what we really
want to see is a badger i'm gonna be
honest we don't really give two craps
about uh
a level three mosquito unless we were
going for bison
which could happen but you know
now
i'm like honestly this one's for the
believers man
and by the believers i definitely mean
like the doubters
swan's gonna stick for a bit take some
meats take some meats's
take a small buff that's why i'm
doubting this time
bro this this hedgehog in front of our
ox is gonna it's gonna decim okay we're
probably gonna lose this one
shouldn't that that dog though dude we
got some favorable trades here early
we're actually definitely going to win
we didn't even have to use our new
animals
lord forgive me for what i'm about to do
[Laughter]
dude you it's
absolutely you can do it
i thought about pilling the hedgehog but
i was like you know i think there's a
better way to do this
now i i do think a blowfish like works
like okay let's just think about this
okay
there's a part of me though that's like
i think believe it or not
i think we want it like this
even though like the swan at the back
seems super weird so like this will hit
die
hurt everything
no we can't do it that way because then
we'll lose our melon armor and the
badger will kill us or almost kill us so
the hedgehog has to go back a little bit
but i was trying to figure out how we're
gonna get the blowfish to trigger
because right now like it's not really
what i'm it's not doing what i want
but that's okay
so i think this is pretty big
just because your stats are good and
they're gonna get better and then i
think uh uh i don't know like i i'm
undecided holy bursh
on whether or not like long term you
would even wanna i mean i get i don't
know man i don't know
this is not the new meta this is just my
new meta
honestly luckiest mosquito you're ever
gonna see
all right you're lucky uh uh if your
mosquito did not
hit my melon armor you definitely lose
that
that was a very very fortuitous draw for
you
now this is a rooster so early
as to be
unbelievably good
i think we at least have to freeze it
for a second and then maybe like because
we don't have buff oh
sorry
i never had a choice
what the heck are we gonna do man what
the heck are we gonna do
is this allowed
dude please
we gotta kill the kangaroo man
please please please please no
whatever you've only got you got no hp
you still killed us but whatever
who cares
oh we lose these son of a
whatever what are we at now six six h
five hp no big deal
level two hog wins that what the heck is
a hog
many people are saying this
hedgehog hedgehog okay
i don't even know why i leveled you up i
think it's just funny like i think it's
just kind of hilarious
please you know
give it a try
this is the squad we love to see
this is the squad that has no chance
nice horses nice dogs just kidding
if we draw this i will know that our our
chances are truly over
i mean the fact that that squad sucks
and we just barely beat it is not a good
sign
i really think we got a crank on this
badger man
like i don't think a blowfish is
actually good here
i think our badger needs to get better
then again i am like you know what there
is another one
so let's give it a try hold on another
hedgehog as well
dude we no okay sorry we gotta like
freeze the hedgehog we have to roll
monkey
the timing is bad but oh we could have
killed the
or the blowfish instead in front of them
you in time you will know what it feels
to lose
to be so sure that you're in the right
and to fail all the same
what the heck is this
am i about to get destroyed here
all right it turns out the monkey is not
very sensible uh behind the hedgehog
that's a play we probably should have
known well in advance
i'm thinking okay i think that the swan
has to go
the swan has to go
but then i'm like
what if you
hear me out here okay
they kill the hedgehog it does damage to
we're going to sell this by the way it
does damage to everything we just need
to make one space of buffer
like like this
then the the badger will not kill us
hold on
i was like what if we buy a gorilla pill
the level one hedgehog but then i was
like i don't think this is sensible
i don't think that's a smart idea
um
it works but whether or not it's worth
it i guess is the real question
i have no idea what i'm doing
i know the second hedgehog dies from the
first that's kind of what i'm banking on
to be honest hey can i tell you
something our cow does not live as a
result we might as well squeeze one
extra roll out of this
okay now let's let's think about this
no
i just wanted to move the positions
i just wanted to move i just wanted to
move the pacific no i can't even can i
just put you further away
because like let me walk you through it
now everyone was so concerned about the
positioning now you're gonna die okay
whatever you don't kill you but when you
die you're gonna kill me through the
melon armor exactly okay very smart okay
but then if i do it this way literally
you kill the hedgehog which i mean at
least allows us to live but
yeah this is pretty bad
this you could roll badger last that's
true
hold on
hold on
hold on
hold
on we win these
[Laughter]
of little faith
what if we just ran three badgers
like we could roll
badger
get out of the way
we got to think about this cause like we
want you to not die
after the first hit
but you're level two so you're gonna
kill all these things when you go okay
hold on
what if we ran a second ox in the middle
here
like what if we ran a
you you can't be here that's a given
whatever you're next to is gonna die
so i'm almost like what do we just put
you who no that's never gonna work man
that's never gonna work
i'm i'm dying here
how do we we gotta
i think we're gonna want to combine
and then i'll put an ox here
but the ox is not going to have melon
armor until something is killed in front
of it
roll one time
what
bro honestly i don't care just send it
just send it man we gotta a
14 you won't die you won't die okay
you'll die you'll live
him him me him me
i lived you peace
oh no he's got melon armor
oh well
hedgehog kind of slammed my game crashed
you're so freaking
lucky that you oh you're so lucky okay
okay
pay out the doubters pay out the
doubters i think it's fair to say that
we kind of we went a little bit sicko
mode on that one
let's let's play a little bit more
contemporaneously



you know i'm sure that in the future we
could probably you know find a way to
make this work
but for the time being
i don't know if it's quite there yet
that being said
honestly i don't dislike this squad
we should have bought beaver first
because i want the beaver to get the
buff or do i i don't know yeah sure like
for winning now i guess i do
sure
a little kicker for the future sure why
not
when you ran the three squad i cried oh
like when we won
with the three squad easily
spicy spicy let's go
we lose these
[Laughter]
did you see survivor yet i did i did see
survivor
don't mind it
bro
we don't need to get the level up yet
honestly i'm gonna do it like this
instead if it buffs the duck it buffs
the duck isn't it i thought it was
another good episode of survivor but
like having so what the heck
having seen uh season
one two three and then season uh
41 is this a recent revelation where
like every tribal council now
uh ends in a series of like high school
style whispers
where where people just decide well
they're at the tribal council uh who
they're gonna vote for
that's pretty new
i think like that's like the one thing
right now where i'm like this seems a
little silly
fans don't like it either excuse me i am
a fan don't gate keep me
i think we could take a three seven
whale i i hate to steal the the ant
stats but
so just shut up just shut the heck up
okay
holy crap oh just think about it though
just
don't talk to me
we're gonna we're gonna make it work
we're one of these days this is gonna
work man
one of these days
and that day is today that day is today
oh please no no
yes yes
where you kidding me this is incredible
you get out of here for now
you show up you get out of here
i mean get into here
you need a little slice of this you need
a little slice of this
the hedgehog is just too tempting man
it's too tempting to not wait people
always roll whale at the front what
about whale at the back you piece
this this squad is interesting
there's another win
what do you think about the abandoned
hat as a reward i think it's really
funny that people wanted to get the
abandon had just to add it to their uh
collection but then it turns out like
when you get it it's semi-permanent like
it takes uh 10 games or something to
purge the abandoned hat
dude there's something about hog camel
here that i can like i can kind of get
down with i kind of feel like we sell
you
that's actually pretty good and then i'm
like what if you just buffed your camel
you know turn after turn
we don't even need a pill anymore
honestly
i don't know what i'm doing like this is
not good for the future but
i'm i don't know man i'm on a wave right
now okay i don't know what to say
everything's everything's going it's
going weird but i kind of love it why am
i buffing a giraffe
what was i thinking never mind i'm the
we can't lose like i'm just looking at
the numbers how are we going to lose
this it can't be done
hog whale at the front dude i don't know
like i'm kind of enjoying hog whale at
the back man
i don't know like it's it's surprise
it's tricking people
it's sending them for a dang loop
i feel like you always benefit from that
straight up man
straight up i feel like you're gone
although i respect what you've done for
me
and now like the kangaroo
i don't know man it's
this is the first team i'm playing
against in a bit where i'm like things
seem a little bit not so amazing for me
oh but we live
but we're gonna
we're not gonna die right away we're
gonna trade then we're gonna kill you
then we're gonna spit out a hedgehog
we're gonna draw
okay okay okay
now we're gonna get a level two hedgehog
spit out at the end
honestly this strikes me as like
definite possible can territory i don't
know about this
so you're gonna do four damage to all
which means our kangaroo will die
on the other hand
it also means
that we will buff our
whale instead which might be kind of
sick now i do see a badger okay but you
know i'm gonna i'm just gonna chill
i'm just gonna chill don't you i'm not
gonna buy the badger
i'm gonna try to make the one
you know this is james gunn suicide
squad i'm not gonna add the the david a
or suicide squad over top
you're so lucky that that when after the
crab got the hp or you'd be
you'd be dead as heck right now okay
speaking of being dead as heck
we lose these but really not by much
quite frankly
like that was it was close
it would be nice for you it would be
really nice if you didn't die like to
get a pear or something would hit the
spot
dolphin snipe fits so good
you know
i never had a choice
that means we don't have to waste our
time with buffs so i'll give you that
i just don't see a monkey fitting here
maybe i'm mistaken but
peacock no the problem look peacock i
honestly think is just uh
i think it's just doodoo tier man like
it needs
to get more hp but me i don't know maybe
if we could get like some melon on it
because we're definitely like
we're in pretty tight on this one and by
in pretty tight i mean uh going to lose
again we were basically like one attack
away
you need this
we
okay i mean you need the buff the most
put dolphin behind whale
why
okay you're probably right the ant
doesn't have to be here
fly
fly turkey no i i like having fun
you can't just get you know i like to
have fun for half the game and then i
turn on sleepo g mode with fly turkey i
don't think so man i don't think so
you don't have to be here but i don't
know who our best option is yet
i gotta think about it
here's what they think about it
skunk's kind of interesting
five sevens that's basically the same
let's give this a try
toss me a little skunk at the front
i want you to go first
freeze this skunk me skunk me
skunk me
oh this is our last life too if we lose
rip believers
[Laughter]
hits everything
no okay
i don't know how to parse this right now
i feel like it's
we have to make it through the dog with
our whale which seems very unlikely to
me
you know what never mind
we draw these
turkey i got a turkey
i got a turkey
and i still drew with this meme squad
um
okay
look
why would we do this
because i think this will make it go
before the dolphin does that matter i
don't know
oh
skunk blind i got i went skunk blind man
if only there's something you could have
done there to not do that
um okay let me think for a second here
let me think
i think you just own it like
unfortunately
i think we just pray we're not going up
against like a meta lord in the next
game
new meta we throw games
all right this seems pretty bad
this this doesn't oh
hold on there's hope
don't you dare
there's no hope there you're not getting
through a 3320 puppy with a level two
hedgehog
that also
spit out a t-rex
oh there was an eagle there my mistake
okay okay
all right this time this time
play it a little easier play a little
more cool don't have to roll hedgehog
builds
keep the shooters on me
the wrinkled nuts doesn't get any better
than that
it's crazy there hasn't been like a
single message today that says you
should change the betting line to seven
who would have thought
so we love the start here
we love this
honestly
toss me one of these
then we'll double up we'll go with a
four piece up at the front
you didn't run the casino this time oh
yeah right right hold on here you go
doubters i don't want to hear any
complaining
people already know like you're doing
well to start with okay then don't bet
if it doesn't know your limits stay
within it if it doesn't feel right stay
away
i don't mind a draw there early game is
not as important anymore
it used to be very critical i don't mind
a camel
i think you could fit one i think you
could do something like this
and then see where the mood strikes us
like i like a dodo
i'm willing to take a small gamble on a
dodo to see if a second one shows up
soon be real with you
that has completely changed the way i
intend to play this
son of uh it's it's the worst odds man
or the worst luck really not the worst
odds
ant luck was good for them bad for us it
happens it happens okay
now smart shrimp scampi
uh sell you i wish we didn't have to
but it's the way the cookie crumbles i
don't care what you buff that's the
worst for sure
and hello nice to see you admittedly i
didn't really give like okay hello nice
to see you
um
this point is just getting a little sad
uh
okay hold the front door we got a level
three mosquito
get the otter out of there
this is also kind of bad but this is
what 10 lives gives us the chance to
affect bing chillin
but uh this this seems kind of bad
yeah we lose these
crab meta four squad marty viewer
confirmed bing chilling reference
okay
combine
buy
sell
buy
i'm gonna i'm gonna do a buy
cell
the elephant is too low on hp
in order to live long enough to affect
our camel positively the next step is
camel with garlic
snipe me
let's go that seemed okay
we win this okay we're pulling something
back we're pulling something back
dude we oh we have a bison we can make a
bison work
no don't don't start with me a hedgehog
don't you start with me
freeze me
honestly i'm just gonna say give me a
quick salad and it kind of worked out
this seems really bad for me
you know
it seems like a win actually
never mind
no bison blindness you're absolutely
right we got to get no bison blindness i
hate to do this because i think our
dolphins go you know no we can't sell
the mosquito
we're going to give the camel
we're going to keep the camel just for a
bit we're probably gonna
everybody shut the heck up okay
sell me
buy me
sell me
[Laughter]
okay that's bad that's really bad
because now we don't have an engine for
our bison that's a real problem
i got i was
i got a little too into the into the
sauce allow me to apologize
this is what happens when you take a day
off from the game that's why you gotta
is why you gotta play
10 hours a day just to stay meta
now there's a chance we get a shrimp
scampi to level three okay
so you're saying there's a chance we get
a shrimp scampi to level three
oh
[Laughter]
holy birch
i actually kind of can't believe it um
i think i would love to sell you and get
like an insane benefit out of it right
like get two level twos
and then
sell and then hopefully they all go to
the bison but
i think we
have an obligation
to not do that
and to accept that maybe this round is
gonna go wrong and that's okay
so i'll tell you straight up like the
camel might not be long for this world i
think for now we rolled the world's
strangest
three squad marty
and then we start rebuilding next round
because this round should absolutely be
a loss
i don't see how it couldn't be
now we technically have one hp that's
not great
none of these appeal to me
you appeal you know what hold on
can me
by me
[Laughter]
two bisons can get us there maybe
and then
i don't see a scale and a hippo so i'm
i'm gonna say for the time being
you take an ox because we like really
need to possibly win this one
the forbidden strategy
level two hippo is horrible for us
because you gain you gain just enough
yeah this is a loss
which is very unsurprising
uh and that takes us out right that's
lethal all right that i mean this is
just a disaster man like we're we
haven't paid out the believers a single
time yet
run me back
if we don't sell the mosquito we're in a
much better place there okay stop
memeing just play the game
just play the game
it's hard not to buff a fish here all
righty
every oh misty mouths is good every
single
run has been a meme
let's not meme it up anymore
let's just let's just have happy fun
times holy crap we won around one i
can't believe it
i'm going in
i don't mind i don't mind
i don't mind man
six six mosquito round two
little three six mafia back there
it's not even close
definitely you go up
[Laughter]
i'll level with you
we're freezing you and we'll probably
freeze you
the way you win this for now believe it
or not
is a meat crab
you maybe sell and then put it you know
i think you roll this for now
and oh i'm sure
and then you hope that a
badger shows up
[Laughter]
all you need is a badger
and then you're off to the races man
very good luck we draw these but that
was a nasty squad
bro okay we'll add an ox because
they'll get the buff from this
straight up man i'm like yeah okay otter
you did you did well but we're hoping to
get a two two later for three gold i'll
tell you what why don't we just get a uh
why don't we get a 1-1 every turn for
zero gold
after we buy it the one time for three
gold
i like the way this looks right now
let's i've got to do some live debugging
like what would i add to this squad
to make this squad better you can sell a
fish now to add something like a swan
temporarily
i would not sell a fish
i mean you know i've been disrespecting
the bunny a little bit i have to admit i
i i let people get into my head
i uh
i went to the super auto pet subreddit i
saw a thread that was like
i always yell at my screen when i see
nl
uh buy a bunny it's not that good and
then there was a circle jerk below it
it's crazy how he thinks the bunny's so
good but it's actually so bad and now
wouldn't you know we paid out the
doubters five times in a row after i
read that uh that resin
that's a good double freeze so maybe
this time will be a little a little
shrewder
and i'll march to the beat of my own
drum this time
bunny is sick what are they talking
about who's they
it's you
they're not you the person but you the
the group
level one rooster
not sweating it yet
not sweating it
bro like
look i'm not mad or whatever but like
you're still rolling horses
what are you thinking
i'm i kind of feel like we should keep
those frozen even though
you know maybe not maybe not maybe not
maybe not okay how do we make this work
we want to stat up
our mosquito
or
i mean the ox but like we we need more
out of this like
get another mosquito maybe a bison shows
up in the future
that's insane
okay now we can start to think about
here's what they think about you now we
can start to think about when a bison
shows up we could actually take one
and don't sell it this time
buy me sell me the uncertain turtles buy
me sell me
sorry to tell you that
my crab is stronger but i wish you the
best of luck in your next game
normally i would think about two bunnies
but i honestly think that it's not
necessary
um because
we don't need hp on you
people might not want to hear it we
don't really need hp on you we do need
hp on you i guess it doubles our odds of
getting it
okay you know what
i sold me
i like this double freeze actually
double bunny plus squirrel i think
you're half right like like honestly
i wish that there was a world where
squirrel did anything
now of course what we want to see
is
well we're gonna lose this
one it's a rooster it happens
rooster dodo is is very much part of the
meta right now no disrespect
some disrespect
okay that's where we get the meat and
potatoes
i mean i'm rolling a crab i'm not gonna
get on anybody for like rolling a meta
builds
like what do you expect lobster
okay for now
i'm going to can
then we can roll crab meat in the middle
and we could do a we could combine crab
here
and then we'll have a crab cascade we
could have done it this turn but i think
this turn with no
meat on the crab is a little bit of a
snoozer
we're one away from the believer
threshold i'm feeling okay here
i just beat a level three horse mouth
i'm telling you like they i don't know
what people are thinking like i guess
maybe they're not watching my stream
which is acceptable um but at the same
time i'm like
people just love the horse man i don't
know what it is
i think it's like when you first start
playing magic the gathering and you have
that revelation that like
uh
you know two cards have the same keyword
and you're just like i'm gonna force
these into every deck i ever run
i i think it's something like that
because like it's for real
pretty bad
um we have to be really careful with the
uh
with the salad because if it hits this
crab it ruins our cascade so instead
we're just gonna roll
a cupcake
believers get paid out by the way i i'm
very quietly we've managed to bust our
streak here this is really bad for us
well
no it's it's pretty bad
i honestly think we can we can dump at
this point
ox before bunny like we're past the best
point of the ox's life and to be honest
with you it's not that strong
anymore
um
especially with no buff on it so i
people are not gonna love this but
i think you can sell it and then roll a
kangaroo which will be much better than
a four or five in all likelihood
that we got a little lucky on it but
i'll take it
okay you know the drill something like
this is still pretty sick
okay i see we've got somewhat similar
builds here dude i i love your um
oh let's go oh let's not go i love your
scorpion in front of your weak unit meta
not that it's going to matter because
we're going to lose this to live like
dragons
crab cascade works
um the
the
active abilities go in order of highest
attack
so like this will activate first then
this crab will steal the hp from the
unit in front of it which is this then
this crab at five instead of six will go
next and steal the unit uh in front of
its hp so it goes like 22 20 to 22. if
you were to mix it up if you put this
crab here then our six eight crab would
become a six six
and then our five six crab would become
a 522 which would be unfortunate
obviously but
um i mean i don't think we're rolling a
bison on this one like i hate to do this
but i
think it looks something like that it's
a very it's a desperation move
and then immediately i'm like okay sell
it for a leopard
or uh for a snail i should say
i mean you know what the kangaroo we can
recoup the kangaroo later at some point
on round 11 i think you can roll a
turtle
the the third crab is is going to be
diminishing returns with no meat
it's way too late to try to get a worm
off the ground now like i think it's a
good play i just think it the odds of us
losing right now as a result of it are
like a hundred percent
hmm this this seems kind of winnable
wow okay we made it
has nl ever try to seal i try a seal
like once a week
and uh
then it doesn't
do anything and i get mad again
so we'll toss a snake in here and hope
for the best
this is unfortunate timing but
we have
the old rabbit can't come to the phone
anymore why he's dead
the parrot will not work well with the
snake
because the snake is only going to get
to attack once i think you either roll
crocodile or badger at the back
it's way too late for the bison
you could roll a deer at the front it's
it's it's got some viability
um
seven damage to last enemy that this
strikes me as our best chance
because if they have a turkey at the
back
or a fly at the back
it would it would oh no wait we got
melon armor
okay we didn't quite kill the kangaroo
but it's an asset to have it lower
that's that's freaking huge man
that's actually freaking huge
you're so freaking lucky though level
two kangaroo is nasty though man
young nasty men we win these
i'm a little surprised but we win these
it's eight wins
i don't every single run i feel like
we're like on the borderline you
definitely need a level two snake more
than a level three mosquito
i feel like a one up on the snake
just in case
and we let it ride
it's tough man it's tough oh it's tough
we got that snake's gotta go what's up
with this badger man that's so funny
okay
okay we lived your owns
you okay i see i see we have another
scholar here hello
we win these let's go man what
all right i'll admit it doesn't seem
like a new meta when we're rolling crabs
and stats
do honestly like the mosquito level up
is worth so little i would much rather
try to like
i don't do it okay you know what
i hate to i'd love to add you back in a
second okay
what the heck
sure it's possible we might draw at
which point we'll be happy to have all
this stuff frozen but
i have to admit their stats seem a
little better
and slash a lot better
no not not my snake anything but my
snake man
yeah there's just no chance yo you know
what though can i tell you i'm happy to
see like a blowfish tropical fish build
kind of work although it definitely
seems like the t-rex had a big role
that's kind of sick
i'm i'm not disappointed in that that
was uh
we paid out the believers we got nine
wins and also uh we we lost to a squad
that was kind of fun man
so no sweat there i'm gonna slash



marker again let's switch over switch
back to pay to win and buy back i mean
switch to pay to win
we got lucky like honestly that was a
six run a six win run that got nine
somehow
like we we were on the edge of our
the extinction every time just like jeff
probst this doesn't look like pay to win
you liar all right never mind
okay this is horrible but
we only lose 10 of our hp
i'll be like an ironic turtle like if i
were to go to um
if i were to go to a halloween party
dressed as dana carvey from the master
of disguise that would be an ironic
turtle by the way we win these somehow
what's up with the odds
we paid out the doubters about seven
times in a row today that's had an
impact on the casino but just remember
the
market can stay irrational longer than
you can say solvent
i don't mind this seems okay really good
mosquito luck
really really good miss uh ant luck
so far so good okay okay
um
definitely i'm interested in a bat
as much as i hate i i hate um when
i get a level two ants cause it's good
to get a level two
it's just unfortunate
that it's an ant cause i do wanna kill
it it's it's hard to not kill it
it is 4-2 on kill though so there's
something to like i'm honestly gonna
freeze you i think it's a good value
freeze oh okay you're you're gone
[Laughter]
okay hold on this changes everything
sell me
buy me
all right you got to run this sort of
build right here
sell me
buy me don't talk to me we just we did
it for the buff okay
this is it we actually have a very
losable squad here which would be kind
of sick because our snail would be
for the cost of one life our snail would
give us some pretty good value
that's good luck
we win these i can't believe it we win
these
the hedgehog's getting it's not sticking
around okay
unless we got another one right away um
so i'm gonna say hugo
obviously you're not really part of the
turbo team um
i'm gonna say uh you are gonna get
pilled and if you hit the beetle i don't
care we can keep the beetle for a bit
that's actually totally fine because now
like
it might seem a little wonky but now we
get a one three bed which means on
combine we'll go to two four instead of
two three when we do combine
you can roll a spider if you have to you
don't want to though we'd well you know
what buy me a spider
because we're going to do some combines
next time this could make the dog
temporarily stronger
and then we obviously want to freeze the
dog because level 2 is insanely
important
and we again we don't really mind losing
right now
hmm
that's pretty bad luck that both of our
that's pretty good luck though
that both of our
uh
weaknesses hit the same thing so that
that's going to be a loss
[Laughter]
and that's
it happens it happens
we're on round five this is really good
honestly we can combine
um
we can buy well let's start here we can
buy and combine
we can buy
combine get a leveled up unit you could
totally just squeeze a deer in just like
that
you're a good buy sell okay i mean this
sucks
but maybe we'll lose this round that
would be nice
in some ways
i no longer believe in the sheep by the
way i think the sheep is is tumbling
down the uh
let's go
well that made no difference but i think
the sheep is tumbling down the power
rankings as we speak
we win these
it takes us to four feeling okay that's
a great buy sell dude you could probably
fit a puppy but
start me here one gold we get a spawn
and then we get our gold back
give me a buy
give me a cell
the problem that i have is fairly
apparent we can't do as well with our
buy cells if we keep a puppy
so it's kind of like it's a puppy or dog
situation
that's cute
honestly i think he frees a beaver and
buy a bat
10 799 this this is looking pretty good
i tried running llama off uh off cam i
still couldn't get it to do what i
needed it to do um
that doesn't mean it's impossible but
it it you know we got some work to be
done there let's put it that way
i think this is a draw
no it's a win because our bat at the
back has so much hp
dude we're kind of cruising here
nice combine
easy buy
easy sell
easy buff one two deer you never know
man you never know
we don't need a pill anymore what am i
doing
okay um we do always seem to always be
getting the snails at like exactly the
wrong time
i'm a simple
man llama sue
begging through texts for a level two
dog
you're not wrong yo dude
that's again weakness might have been
nerfed but overriding equipment never
goes out of style we win again that's a
believer payout
yo that's okay
that's pretty good i think you sell your
swan even though we just no you know
what
i think with this much hp we're at a
very nice pivot point
i think you sell your beetle
thank you um
you buy a worm we might sell our swan
anyway
you give your worm garlic
this actually changes things you can
sell a swan
the worm
you could you can run this you can sell
your swan
buy a poodle
dog at the back so it gets the poodle
buff
worm to the left of the poodle
you
slightly further you
yeah i want to keep you like out of bus
range if possible
it's a good buy sell which is fine
because we're probably gonna dump our
deer at some point
and then you need to eat
it's only two buffs for now but it'll
change
remember this this is the round that
should look a little tricky
because we're we're doing like a hard
pivot right now
all right this is not good
poodle jump
the deer's gonna go we we do want like a
i don't want anything to replace the bad
but
it's a little goofy don't get me wrong
come on come on man
there don't i'll take it i'm a little
cheese but i'll take it
and they're all level twos huh
well okay toss me a swan right here for
the time being
i still like where we're at as of round
nine
but it you know we're gonna start to run
into some nasty squads
i would just like to say when i said i
liked where we were at i would like to
apologize
that was a mistake however
buff me
buy me
sell me
freeze me
by me
roll me
you seeing this
[Laughter]
freeze me freeze me freeze me
um
now i i genuinely think
you need to
get garlic
on your dog before you get any of these
units but if we live through this turn
then
it goes
and it starts to freaking chunk man
this would be a nice win it's only round
ten we shouldn't be fighting against
turkey flies or
okay level two rooster with a level two
turtle is a little nasty
it's a little nasty
all right well good game
wait no matter what we did there we were
going down to that team i mean that's
just like that's that's the meta right
now
the believers get paid out regardless
and we'll run it back
the rooster i honestly do think it needs
a little bit of a nerf
because it's just
i mean you're you're seeing it as much
in like the late game now
as like you saw the uh the dodo when the
dodo was too powerful i don't know how
you nerf it but like
the the rooster is is too good right now
the leaking nuts that's the a plus team
name for sure
you could that's true you could make it
a tier six
tier six would would
would mitigate it we drew a horse team
but only because their otter also
existed
50 damage i don't know half attack i'm
like i think it makes them
kind of useless
i also think they want to avoid having
like uh like a
paragraph when you mouse over an animal
because like the simplicity of the game
is one of its its strengths
just tearing them up maybe i don't know
i mean i don't know anything about the
balance of the game i think they've done
a great job with this so far
um
honestly i don't think we needed our
aunt to get started
i think if anything i'd like to
let's
come on
the desync is like the strongest unit in
the game
there okay you know what it's actually
not that bad
good play good play
it turned out fine i'm just annoyed
we actually win these
okay so that's a combined i don't know
if this is a combine yet
every time man
freeze me
give me one
i mean if we're gonna roll a pig we
might as well roll a shrimp instead
it's a two two versus a two one at least
we have some upside attached to the
shrimp
this seems kind of bad unless i don't
know what it what if we could have hit
your hedgehog earlier
yeah this seems really bad
that's fine
there been any 10 spots today no but
like to be honest we did spend
a lot of the game
especially early just memeing like we we
did like i knew it was coming too it's
the worst part we basically did like an
hour
of just hedgehog uh badger builds
i'll take one
i'm gonna do it even though we could
have teared up next time i'm gonna do it
this time
i don't see a blowfish doing it for us
man like this squad is is definitely
like kind of doo-doo right now
we're not even doing anything with our
scampi
i will say honey badger ox has got me
it's got me interested
i like this like later game duck build
what the heck
is this allowed
well we win these but that was weird
badger isn't a meme
the way i was running it it was a meme
i will i promise you this
i need to buff units that do some damage
can you give me maybe some of that
honestly this probably gives us the best
chance round five are we gonna really
start to squeeze a dog out there i don't
think so
uh
i i hate it because we're gonna end up
rolling a 1-1 puppy but it's very
important i think
for our chances of winning in general
i'll i'll take two losses here to get
this puppy rolling
this is there's no shot no shot
17-13 dog
come on come on come on
okay
honestly like we just bat it's been nice
to have you but we just need to win some
rounds
i'll be honest we win more rounds
giving a buff to you
than we do giving a buff to you so we'll
just let the gold kind of percolate down
here
do you like or dislike the health change
i like it a lot honestly i think that
changing the meta of the game so that
you don't absolutely have to win in the
early game is good for the overall
health of the ecosystem
you gave a buff to both no i mean like i
don't want to give the food to the puppy
because we need to give it to the unit
with garlic he's still going to get the
buff from the gold
okay we're on lethal right now so things
are mighty tough
three three two one one
i think it kind of has to be done we
have to scale however we can
no binding of isaac
who's gonna tell him
um
okay freeze me
roll yeah freeze me
him me him him me okay maybe we should i
don't know i don't really care who gets
the buff
there's a chance okay
there's no we lose
[Laughter]
is he no longer streaming isaac
um hold on we'll pay out the doubters i
don't want to screw up the payout here
start me again
uh we're i don't have any plans to play
isaac on twitch if you want to see some
isaac i have a few episodes of it on my
youtube channel
i like this start don't need another ant
yet i like this start
you know what i'll be the extra ice
cubes here
yeah but the patch though i'm not going
to speak about the patch i think some of
the changes are good some of the changes
i do i'm like skeptical is maybe not the
right word but like i'm just kind of
like why but then the other thing is
like i really don't
the current state of isaac i'm like i
don't really care what they do to change
the game
[Laughter]
i got me i'm on my way out quite frankly
and it's not the game's fault i've just
played like a ton of it
i'm going to throw some bees on you
you would probably feel the same
if you had played 5 000 hours of it
and again it's nothing against isaac
it's it's just like man i'm just like oh
we lose these
i'm just kind of like tapped it's like
it's
it's time
you can no longer complain about
birthright though i wouldn't sweat it
pretty soon i probably won't be
complaining about anything in the isaac
episodes because at some point in the
near-term future there won't be any
so i'll get the jokes out now while they
still play while the punch lines still
work
and oh man
i ca i can see the gold watch in the in
the box right now 50 years of isaac
i can see the gold watch coming
it's coming
round the bend uh freeze me one
me one of these
buff
me you will now become a three-five
buff me
it's a little weird
it's a little weird
i and honestly i know this sounds bitter
i don't mean it to sound like that but
like
if the amount of people
that were in chat
that were like you can't cancel isaac
like watch the episodes instead of just
feeling like the the show can never be
ended but at the same time they're not
entertained enough to actually click on
the videos
then like the show the series would
maybe last a little bit longer
it's like when people haven't watched
the tv show in like 10 years and they're
like oh
mythbusters is going off the air well
yeah like you stopped watching it
it's still it's a way of the world man
okay we're on round four
at some point we gotta combine these
that point is probably now
a bat is is always nice but we do we run
it like too often
that's a good freeze
come on man
okay you know what you piece
i'll run it i'll run it i'll run it
dude i don't know what's happening
either like i'm cracked or we're going
up against like trash squads because i
feel like we should not be well we're
gonna lose this one
how many times have you said you're
going to quit isaac though i'm telling
you for real like you you're you're
huffing the copium right now
like this this one is the real one
and it's not even because like super
auto pads is popping
it's it's more just like isaac is is
like it's the natural point for it to be
over like when they they did just
release a patch but when you have like
such a massive game
like and you release a patch that's like
you know we changed like six things
you're like well it'd take me like
another 1000 episodes for me to get to
the point where like i even see all the
stuff that's in the patch
dude okay hold on this is kind of sick
we have four hp
i think this is hard pivot
let me think about this for a second
let me think about this for a second
let me think about this for a second
seven seven round six
with upside
it would be nice to draw this but i
think we can try to get this going
that's the the math on this is very
unfortunate for me
okay well you know what
it's gonna come down to it
i think we can get there we just need
the buffalo to pop which means we need
more space which means you gotta go
we know we're gonna have to buy you
i i would like to fit a turtle in what
the heck
okay
um
this is very weird
but isaac isn't about isaac it's about
the anecdotes i mean i don't know like
we played 4 000 hours of it on youtube
and like it's
like i'm just
i'm kind of
like hey i'm kind of tired of it for one
and b like the analytics are not
very good
it's the right time you just you know
it's like the fallout dlc you know
you gotta learn how to let go sometimes
find another banter game
you just let me worry about that you
just watch what you find entertaining
and it will all fall into place like
when people are like oh what am i going
to watch to fall asleep literally like
anything else
it doesn't even have to be me
just watch like listen you could listen
to a podcast or an audiobook
you could listen to old isaac episodes
if you wanted to you could try something
else
there's there's i'm not trying to you
know bite the hand that feeds i'm just
saying there's an infinite amount of uh
of options out there
put on a mouth spelunky two episode they
even if it takes you six hours to fall
asleep
you'll uh
you'll have more than enough content
okay i mean look i love the hatching
chick we gotta buff our
this is what we wanna do we want to buff
our
bison buffalo
i wouldn't mind having a turtle
if we could squeeze a turtle in here
somewhere
for for now
we're gonna do this
then we're gonna hold you
for next round
i think we can still win this one
here's how we can still win
i'd
it just sucks this kangaroo got buff
no we're totally fine dude the believers
don't die on this one
don't give it up
you're good sell me
buy me
place me buy me
sell me
freeze me
buy me
sell me
roll me
freeze me
buy me
one more round man
that's all i'm asking just just like
jake gyllenhaal in the trailer for
ambulance that ran before dune
just one more job
this looks pretty okay honestly
minus two for what
jake gyllenhaal is cancelled right now
for what
being in a michael bay movie
not showering
he didn't shout that's not a cans oh
it's a taylor swift thing okay fair
enough i'll stay out of it
[Laughter]
he was mean to taylor swift
how dare he
how dare he
you know what that means though jake
gyllenhaal's got to release his own song
in order to defend himself
i'm looking forward to that one
i have to buy one of these
but
they're all bad
micro behind scorpion
i mean i could see you working you know
what you're right yeah what no i would
know you're wrong
no you're right okay
yeah we'll do a four squad marty cause
like a poodle is gonna buff a scorpion
literally irrelevant
it's gonna buff up a
buffalo which is not it's worth one for
the buy and then also one for the
um the poodles buff like we might as
well just get a pair instead because the
caterpillar buffs are worth nothing
don't kill me
numbers just happen to work out in our
favor here that's is that a believer
payout
look at that we did it
i think i love a scorpion i think we
have to buy a goat
and then if we find things worth buying
and selling
which we have not yet
which we have okay you sell a scorpion
you buy a pig
it gives you gold
effectively you got that for zero which
is kind of pog
i guess we'll get
it's tough
i i want a turtle
i think a turtle matters more than a
couple of stats
i should have taken the turtle that
showed up earlier that's that's
doubtless
but i'm willing to go down to two or
sorry to three
no turtle melon armor sadly does not do
the same for us here so
of these i genuinely
think you just buy a
cupcake i'm betting on melon armor
lasting
no we should have frozen in but i'm
betting on
garlic holding for one more round
oh my god
we drew
saved saved saved
whoo
thank you
oh well definitely oh that's an order
right there for sure
okay
am i really gonna buy a t-rex hold on
you buy a beaver you go to four gold
sell you go to five no okay we i mean we
have i mean you gotta fit a t-rex in
here i don't know i guess we're gonna
sell our our goat at some point
maybe now because we need the space to
keep buffing our our bison oh wait t-rex
sucks right now t-rex sucks because it's
not gonna yeah it's only gonna buff our
buffalo for two that's not as we can get
two just by buying something you piece
honestly this is anti-scorpion
anti-melon technology right here
anti-scorpion
anti-anti-melon technology the hedgehog
has returned
holy bursh no no no okay
order saved us somehow
i thought i thought that the hedgehog
was gonna kill both of our butterflies
before they got their hp and i was very
very upset okay that's win number seven
you need melon armor
you can still go
you can stay but we gotta
we wouldn't mind you being oh
okay well we're not gonna need a
hatching chick that's for sure
mouth you got me so scorpion paranoid by
the way you peace
i guess we might well you're going to
get the 50 50 regardless so
so now i like i roll either a scorpion
or a chump blocker every game
i mean we need things to help us win now
a turtle is really like the only thing
we could totally fit this turtle
if we can get it to level two that'd be
sick
if we win this round there's a chance
man
okay i mean a 50 31 dying in one hit is
very nice for us
wow okay that went way better than i
expected
you leave
you stay
you get buffed
chocolate or a turtle
i would sell a scorpion to get chocolate
or a turtle
now i'm just clicking
son of a
anti-deer technology anti-whale
technology nice steak
okay still a pretty sick steak honestly
i mean this should be a win we we
actually could get to 10 wins pretty
realistically
turkey fly is just like tell me you hate
fun without telling me you hate
fun don't know actually we might lose
just due to the just due to the way that
that things
play out here
there's no might we actually just did
lose
turkey fly hey do you know what makes me
so pleased though like good game or
whatever um but like it i always loved
that oh i almost paid out the doubters
pay out the believers
um
i love that sometimes people will post
on like the super auto pets subreddit
and it'll be like um
hey got my first 10 win and then their
team is like turkey fly tiger and then
it just gets instantly downvoted to like
minus 30.
and i'm like you get what you deserve
[Laughter]
okay we did it good good start my we'll
run one more back here we'll run one
more back we got we got muddled in isaac
discourse
it's the thing nobody watches it
everybody wants to talk about it then
hans mole man at the back
i watch it okay it was i wasn't talking
about you thank you for your support
okay we like it
we like it
we like it
we freeze it i like buying food on pay
to win turn two
eager tea bag just there's a certain
cellar door kind of lilt to it i like it
please please
we win these
nice horse nice horse
just kidding
honestly
buy me
and then let me sneak out a 2-4
and a 2-3 this is a this is a nasty turn
to squad
it's pretty good luck
pretty good luck oh extremely good luck
we win these
combine me four five
five six
add a puffer fish into the equation i
don't mind it
hit me with one of these also buffs your
ladybug
seven seven
kaiser permanente seven seven green
ladybug
this squad is pretty good early
i thought they had a scorpion i don't
know my brain is like it sees what it
wants to see or maybe what it doesn't
want to see i legitimately thought that
they had a scorpion
and i was like what the how does that
happen
[Laughter]
i was very upset briefly
with inflation the survivor grand prize
is now 60 as valuable as it was in 2000
look i
agree
it does seem kind of crazy i mean i
don't know maybe survivor's 60 percent
more pop or less popular than it was in
2000 but like at some point they got to
redo the prizes for these reality shows
right
like the fact that one person who wins
big brother
gets 500 000 and like second place gets
fifty thousand like five hundred
thousand dollars is really good for
three months of work even if you are
getting cyber bullied by people with um
janelle avatars on twitter
oh big brother just went up to 750. okay
at least
you know what thank you thank you julie
thank you
it just seems to me like like survivor
could kick it up a little bit
south african survivor prize is eighty
80 000 usd
that's like criminal i understand that
with cost of living you probably get
you know it goes further than it would
in america but that's like
absurd
anyway sorry sorry
um i don't think we buff our flamingos i
did think about it
here's what they think about you
you can turn four with non-stop wins you
can roll a dog you can combine your
mosquitoes buy a dog
sell
a ladybug
roll once to get something better buy
one of you combine one of you
this is a very tough decision quite
frankly
did you watch big brother before being
friends with dan i watched season one
and two of of big brother um
i like this food meta man
maybe one two three a big brother i
remember eddie winning i remember dr
will season
we're the same squad
blowfish difference
this has got to be a draw right like
the same squat i i also watched um
i watched like the first three seasons
of survivor i definitely saw up until
ethan won i don't know if i watched
another season past ethan
we're gonna need to sell two things here
to make this work this squad is gonna
pop though
honestly
get out of my face
roll once
get out of my face
buy me
sell me
buy me
combine me
buy me i'm going all out man i'm going
all out you need to go too
maybe we can roll a salad real quick
first
thank you by the way thank you prawn
buster
the gifted subscriptions thank you
um rip to me by the way a 1514 mosquito
is actually going to be 16 15 by the
time we get there
we lose these
but hey the losses don't hurt as much
yet
uh never mind
[Laughter]
but if they didn't hurt as much
okay i'm going all in well we've got
technically three hp
give me a shrimp scampi
sell me a sell this beetle
feed the dog you piece does it buy me
this is sell me
thank you thank you
okay you can freeze this for sure
i don't know like it's
it's just funny i guess
i'm gonna be real with you
i think this does more for us right now
that's cool okay yeah yeah i think this
does more for us and the puppy is in a
class of his own we get two levels up
oh come on
great minds think alike just where's
super fast mode
where's the super fast mode
victor andre thank you for the gifted
subscriptions as well thank you
tier five
you know like
settings gameplay okay
i mean i think a goat is like genuine
ass here
i'm gonna be real with you i think it's
more important for us
to get that what the hell man
okay fine
you you want it you got it
you want the weird build by all means
here's your damn weird build okay
how many triggers you got left one
trigger left what do i want here let's
end with the let's say i'm with the
hatching chick even though it's not a
tier one we'll freeze that tier one for
next time
i guess we could roll one time
oh my god oh my god
so yeah we're trying to make a chicken
work i guess so we got two 15 19s that's
not that bad honestly
as long as we don't get sniped
this could be an interesting build
i don't know if goat's gonna stick
around forever but i appreciated the
work it's done so far
all right so that's four and we still
got two lives now you just you're no
matter what you know you're dumping this
i don't know now i'm like what if you
sell the goat you just get a buffalo
like we're popping
somehow we're still at nine gold
um
i don't know man i feel like we got to
keep these around just as like a fun
engine
so we will buy this of course
these are not tier ones
you have one trigger zero triggers left
what a piece
technically you could totally make a
bison work here but
is it as fun as just trying to have
i guess we could buy the bison
and then
sell the goat
yeah and keep space open for tier ones
okay i can live with this i can live
with this
sell chicken shut up
doubter
doubter spotted
i'm not i'm not sold on this one yet but
it i don't know
it's it's all because i just like a
turtle always throws a monkey wrench
into things but you know what
that's okay
we definitely win this we definitely win
this
those two turns of chicken goat have
have changed the game for us keep in
mind like a scorpion is gonna come out
as like an eight eight or something like
that
if we if we play our cards right sell me
buy me
sell me
buy me
sell me
what is wrong with me
i meant to put that on the
face
i'm so fricked up
oh man
i'm gonna i'm gonna fit a skunk in here
why not
welcome welcome to the squad
double garlic new tech new tech just
dropped double garlic
oh camel's taking a camel's getting hit
for four damage pretty spicy
dude dude we're kind of cruising
okay believers get paid out after all
that the believers get paid out
buff me as far as i'm concerned we can
stick with the chicken build until
we get down to lethal status
i would love to just
 out of like 30 30 scorpion
i guess we'll stick here for now
i mean is it 10 12 man that's kind of
sick
freeze me freeze me freeze me freeze me
freeze me freeze me freeze me unfreeze
me unfreeze me
what do you do
i'm i'm keeping it oh don't you
unfreeze me freeze me
i'm keeping it frozen
it's it's the greatest shop i've ever
seen
oh
we needed that scorpion out there man
okay now we're on lethal status wait do
you have a squad
you do it okay you have a squad just
barely just barely
i'm telling you your life's about to be
ruined here
y'all ready for this
you gotta start here
sell me
buy me
shell me
and then i'm gonna
we tried okay
you're gonna get gone i am so confident
that
an 11 11 scorpion
can do some serious work
it doesn't need to kill everything like
just a couple of things like killing the
whale is really solid
then our garlic gets to do some work
level three bus
it's a little spicy
too bad it matters not at all
now i know what you're going to say
you're going to say you can't afford to
dump this scorpion now that's where
you're wrong okay because an 11 11
scorpion is the default stats for a
scorpion
it can be removed
by me
sell me
buy me
sell me
roll me
freeze me
roll me
buy me
sell me
14-14 scorpion
dog got a little we should definitely
have frozen the melon armor
[Laughter]
oh it's so close
it was so close oh we trade we
we lose we lose these okay but fair
enough fair enough with i like seeing
his scorpion position four that's fun
that's fun
we did get to six wins or more we got
the seven
let's throw a slash marker in there
and i would say we got like another 25
minutes



hey everybody
welcome back
it's super auto pets what can you say
what can you say uh no secret i've been
getting a little bodied here i don't
even remember whether we're on pay to
win or
not pay to win i don't know where we
did this tells me nothing can i tell you
something though
i actually have come around the ducks a
little bit i'm at least i i like the
idea let's be the the gasping gems you
know nothing like a like a like a
desperate diamond if you know what i
mean
hold on regular puppet that's that's
something you don't see that much we
definitely uh draw these um i've come
around to the idea of a uh of a duck as
part of a potential scale especially
losing in the early game
doesn't matter as much as it once did
and
you may also not lose and if you don't
lose then you've basically paid only the
monetary cost
of buying these units like we we win
these we win these with ducks the dream
would be an ants
didn't happen but i love this is like a
classic kind of setup for me this is my
new early game gambit that i would
recommend if i made some clickbait
videos i right now make it click
clickbait thumbnails maybe a little
clickbait title but the video itself is
just a stream of consciousness um if i
ever made like a ten minute one second
long one mid roll video that was like
how to win in super auto pets new meta
i think it would look like
getting a couple of ducks early
selling them and then rolling a five six
swan or a six seven or an eight nine
i will fit one of you
i'm not gonna freeze that pill yet this
ant has more work to be done
you absolutely can and perhaps should
roll a dog
honestly i think i could keep you i know
how this sounds i know how it sounds
we're not going to roll crab meat just
cause like honestly
someone called it out in the most recent
videos comments but i kind of agree
new meta for me is like
winning is great
who doesn't like to win but even more
than winning like if you can get
seven or eight wins with a fun build
then that's that's beautiful
the thing i will say is you might be
like well how fun is it to roll uh
like uh
uh a dog well the dog is just the first
engine the first engine that allows us
to get some other stuff going okay um
it's not necessarily themed around the
dog this is just what gets us going
until
we get an ox so let's sell you
let's buy
you
[Applause]
get a turtle
mighty interesting this turtle guy
certainly
i think we could garlic is gonna be
really valuable but we can put garlic on
our dog
and we could put
melon on our swan like i don't dislike
this now the question is do we want to
like
there's two ways to do this you could
buy a duck and then
sell it and then buy a 5 6 rat that's
going to be like a nasty
creature or you could bet on winning and
you could buy the rat buff the dog
buy the duck and then next level dude
four six is kind of sick next next turn
we're gonna get tier three units you
sell the duck you buy an ox or something
like that i've really i've become much
more to use uh the most cringe-worthy uh
parlance possible that become much more
bullish on auxes i think they do very
well in the extended mid game of a of a
10 life meta which is where we live
right now
so
um it's unfortunate like we don't get
much out of the cell but i do like it
and we'll roll this i'm the three seven
whale but i don't want to lose the stats
on this ants now the question is is it
worth
two gold for three stat points
i think the answer is yes
at this stage of the game i think the
answer is yes
okay i like this
if it goes wrong like if we get a trash
unit
which we didn't we would have taken
garlic instead we're going to freeze
garlic and i like having a little four
six out there
um that's decent stats and will also
snipe some stuff that can screw them up
like if it snipes a hedgehog or a horse
or something like that like life's gonna
be pretty good
this seems okay yeah i got no complaints
like this this squad is just it's just
stats that do good things and we get a
little economic power as well out of our
uh
out of our swan which is going to stick
around by the way so we'll sell the fish
it's only a 4-5 we'll continue our
stat point generator i don't mind it i
think this is extremely important we
still got eight gold to work with like
that's that's kind of incredible
i definitely like uh
this
you might say that it kind of sucks that
we got some fish um after selling our
fish but i actually really
uh we don't need that yet i'll buy this
for now um i actually think that i
really disagree like i think that uh it
was it was good that we didn't get
suckered into trying to get a level
three fish which tends to not be that
good in my experience unless you got
maybe like some bison or something
uh
yeah okay you got a good squad you gotta
get and the timing worked out well for
you there you lost melon armor
uh to a unit that could have killed you
so that's not nothing but respect
our ant is probably ready to pill
but in order for that to happen you need
to
get a pill
i think it's worth selling like the
penguin's okay the dolphin i think is
more fun so let's let's just get the
monkey for now i don't really care for
the duck uh ability here then we can
peel you
it's not amazing but you can stick
around for a bit and i don't really mind
having the dog at the front here
then
you could roll a crab
if you got a crab and meat that's a nice
temporary option i actually think
that a hippo is probably the way to go
um i don't expect it to really pop just
yet but the dolphin can then leave
if we can get the dolphin to bail in
favor of a second monkey for a little
bit that that could do some work for us
man okay so we screwed up the sheep for
them which i think is is nice for us
we actually draw which is kind of
impressive considering you know we were
going up against a pretty nasty dog
there our dog on the other hand is
honestly getting kind of close to no
longer being that relevant
for the time being that can change
pretty quickly so we're gonna try to
keep it going i think it's more valuable
than another dolphin
so i know i was singing your praises
earlier but i just think it's a little
late for you right now
swans interesting but if i'm being
honest with you i do think this swan
a little overrated in the present meta
he says as he buys a level one beaver
just to sell it but
alas i never had a choice um you can you
can roll a kangaroo as like in a pinch
i i think
i think this is how it looks i think a
deer is like the second best
tier like level one to just throw into
your squad for three gold a scorpion
would obviously be first
um
any value we get out of this bus i'm
gonna be like thrilled
and then i think that we do like by
weakening them oh my god you're still
alive
our hippo has a chance to actually do a
little bit more than it usually would
sure this seems great to me
five wins but we don't want to roll a
deer long term i think unless maybe we
get it like super upgraded but i
honestly think we just happened to run
into like the dream squad uh
from the perspective of
our opponent uh having like the ideal
squad to get bodied by me but we're this
is a classic situation like this happens
with the dog all the time
that's very nice
uh
and i guess we did waste a buff but
whatever
it was the right positioning and and we
won the round people sometimes i i
genuinely think people are like yeah you
won the round which is the goal but the
real goal is not to win the round the
wheel the real goal is to uh
you know it plays perfectly optimally so
then if you lose you can be like how
dare you game how dare you so i'm gonna
do the same thing here but anyway we're
kind of wedged in like
this is big
and a level two hippo is more important
than a level three swan a level two dog
though is also interesting so we're
freezing i mean we got 12 gold so we can
freeze 12 gold worth of stuff but i know
we wasted the buff again i i stand by it
i stand by it
it's a level two hippo which is really
really bad
yeah it's just gonna
just gonna run wild on us
hmm the dog either has to go
or it has to be replaced with something
better
or
let me rephrase or like
by replaced i mean
one thing that could replace it is just
another dog
so i'm gonna keep the
you know we screwed up the timing on
this like so badly
um
i'm gonna try it like this i'm gonna
keep you frozen i'm gonna hope that at
16 19 level two you got a shot i want
you to take those monkey buffs we're
getting into some touchy
situations here if i was just gonna say
if we could at least get two kills i
wouldn't be so upset
i think we win this
in spite of like i lost the plot for a
little bit there but that takes us to
six wins also known as the believer
threshold are we going to stick with
this dog i think we have to
i think we're at some point we're kind
of wedged in people always talk about
the sunk cost fallacy nobody talks about
the flip side which is the sunk cost
reality
[Laughter]
sometimes you are
you're too sunk to pivot out and that's
okay i like i i actually think it's
totally fine you you could roll tiger
behind a hippo but we have
we're not gonna die even if we lose so i
think you level up your dog
and then i do think
i mean snake is great here too
i don't think you roll tiger hippo yet
i think you get you you steal your buffs
maybe freeze your snake too
um i mean maybe you don't put the cow
behind the hippo long term i don't think
that's gonna have a material impact but
okay so pretty much no matter what we
were we were going down this time that's
this is a really strong bison
[Laughter]
it happens
um
one way to do this okay
let's act like we're on the verge of
death and i think we are
sell your swan sell the cow
roll snakes
behind your
hippo and a tiger behind the snake then
buff the crap out of this hippo
i would not
even come close to suggesting this is
like a a guaranteed win
you gotta freeze that though okay start
start here
freeze this uh maybe we should have
gotten that instead
that that might actually
be a pretty big mess up um although to
be honest with you things kind of look
all right here
what happened to your fly
didn't you have a fly is this is this
the classic case of just trying to fit
in like way too much on uh
on one run like you just had too many
good units so you couldn't decide the
composition something it happens
um so we love this
i think we need this
you're like at exact living range i'm
going to be honest with you i think at
this point i i didn't think we were
going to do this but i think the dog's
got to go in order to make space like
the the run lives and dies with the
hippo the dog is not going to be it's
not likely to be a difference maker
okay that's extremely nice
snake help me out here
i think i i think you you did it you did
it thank you
okay that takes us to eight it's it's
it's a long road here okay i'm not
i'm not calling a necessary victory i'm
just saying there's a chance
roll me one time
um
i think the best thing you could do here
is you sell the cow it's not likely to
be relevant and then just toss like a
melon armor
it's more important that it's on your
snake than on your tiger i think they
both want it we could do a one-up on the
tiger as well we just don't want to be
sniped and uh
we look we we our anti-scorpion tech has
worked out for us here that's very nice
that could have helped us out a little
bit more but
okay we're going down but honestly we
put up a very valiant effort there
that's eight wins and i can't be too
upset by it
just hide the screen for a moment as
we've been disconnected from the servers
oh no we're still on okay look at that
we're back okay so i still don't know
that was that was free to play right
okay
let's stay with free to play i like to
keep the videos themed in like one
direction um i can roll a mosquito and
an otter i think this squad is like you
know beats here
this is crazy i don't know what to buy
i think you roll a double freeze and
then you get a 4-4 mosquito out there
2-3 otter
i don't know man
be a flexible piece like a piece of
taffy or something like that
isn't it crazy
why why is the stereotype that old
people love
taffy or and toffee like i'm not even
that old i take good care of my teeth
and
like even
it's interesting i think we can invest
early we at least try to invest early
even like
at my relatively non-advanced stage
i still get like
candy gets stuck in my teeth like crazy
man
i guess maybe if you have false teeth
like can't they make them out of like
teflon so that you never get anything
stuck in them
maybe that's the case
we win these thanks to the rat that's
just great luck
okay so we're going up a level this is
this is that we go up even one level
further thanks to this yeah okay um
a whale is sick
i think it's maybe a little too late to
invest in the fish
the problem with the whale
is that we do need to have it eat
something
and i know you're like don't do it man
[Laughter]
on the other hand
um
look i'm i'm basically i'm gonna make a
bet okay
and i mean you could definitely just get
a cricket here but my bet is
that
my mosquito
is going like this this will kill
all of our units but the mosquito when
the whale dies and then the hedgehog
comes out again i bet my mosquito was
going to let us hang in there
now i'm just i'm a very simple man i'm
looking at what i'm seeing and
as of right now i'm not too disappointed
okay it went wrong
and i'm like way too into the idea of
this hedgehog build you got to get me
off of this unless there's some way we
get out of it and i don't think there's
a way we get out of it right now so
let's sell a hedgehog
i'm gonna say no to the dog i think the
dog is a very important potential
partner here but i'm gonna say no to the
dog for now okay that's my my promise to
you
we'll fit a swan cause i always want to
fit a swan i'll buy one of these
we'll roll once
okay this we can make something work
here we can sell honestly i want our
dodo to pop but if it's not going to get
there it's not going to get there we'll
roll a flamingo that actually gives us a
nice benefit from eating it we'll
probably pill the flamingo we need to
have garlic uh on our mosquito garlic on
our mosquito alone is gonna do us a lot
of favors they this is the the most
optimistic dodo build i've seen in my
entire life
it might work at some point but it's not
going to work against work against us
good luck to the sticky tugboat
i think you absolutely do have to
do something like this
and i
honestly i would sell a level two three
four to put a second swan
i would roll a sheep even though this
people
fixate on the sheep not getting the
value at the front that it would if it
was a little bit back but with the whale
it doesn't really matter you no matter
where you put it as long as you have a
full squad you're not gonna have space
for the ram but let's not do ourselves
the disservice of structuring our whole
run around like a 2-2 ram you know we we
can there's more important things than
that just to capture some extra value
here we'll do that do this freeze a
salad um i'm not sold on this
necessarily i still think garlic on our
mosquito is our play but i do like a
rabbit as like a to start a round with a
rabbit
uh
to start a shop i should say with your
rabbit is always nice to me
okay so the numbers are okay for us here
not not bad yet
um we we definitely win this
looking to pivot from the whale soon
that's that's a
definitely true i think you're gonna get
sold
this honestly seems to me to be like a
good
uh buying opportunity for foods
and i don't mind
selling a rabbit if we got something
worthwhile
i'm gonna give it one more round though
yeah yeah i'm gonna give it one more
round so we can roll
oh i don't mind if you eat an ants
he said rather you eat a flamingo or
would i i don't know maybe
did i do that just because it's a tear
up yes i did is that a problem maybe yes
maybe no um
i'm not bullish on this uh
on this particular situation we got here
i think that turtle is going to become a
disaster for us i i don't see a
situation where we win this
i mean are you seeing this turtle have
you seen this turtle
at least it replaces the the mead but
yeah our our squad just is is in that
awkward like phase right now where we
don't know how to shave but yet we have
a mustache you know what i mean
so
you should take one of these
while we got em honestly you might as
well take one of these you're gonna
stick around for a bit
i don't see our whale making it man i
i'm not gonna invest in our whale
i think a turtle could be a big play
though okay now i'm feeling slightly
better but again our units are they're
they're reaching soon at least oh my god
this is terrible
[Laughter]
they should soon be reaching kind of
like their maximum efficacy i think oh
my god we actually win these somehow i i
don't understand how but here we are
um
i can i can live with that you're the
most likely units to stick around so
please do um
i don't mind the turtle here even with
the knowledge that it would replace the
garlic armor
i can live with that hey what is this
are you crazy we're actually leveling a
unit up we need the freezer bison imo
oh man okay that's unnecessary here's
the thing you can have a whale
uh eat a scorpion
it'll spit out a scorpion with a peanut
a one up will not but like right now
we're really looking for another
mosquito that lets us get a bison focus
on scaling the bison and anything can
happen we're toast this this one is no
chance and i i gotta say like i i do
respect it this is the power of the dog
build quite frankly
if you get a dog that's why you take it
so often it's like the the first
reliable scaling engine that shows up
so i acknowledge i deliberately sort of
inhibited myself by not taking
the dog but you know we took it on the
one before it so i'm not going to cry
about it
let's
sell a whale
roll a bison and i'm going to give the
bison the armor
uh and i'm gonna roll uh a scorpion up
at the front
in the hopes that that gets us where we
need to go now i freeze me
level two turtle is is mighty
interesting isn't it why don't you
freeze me for a second
i think it's more important
that we get you scaled much faster so
i'm very i'm content with the way this
looks please do not kill me yet we are
ready to go like this run can now take
off please tell me it wasn't a turn too
late i i'm looking at it now and i'm
thinking of myself
certainly looks like it might have been
a turn too late
all right well it happens um
we still what do we get four wins there
we yeah we broke even
look
it's painful but we gotta end the video
here it's a saturday i gotta take my my
daughter to the activity gym
what are we we are eight and four it's
funny that like a you know 1.5
win rate
like 50 more wins than losses it hurts
but we're still figuring out where we
stand in uh in our meta with ten lives
it's going to take us a bit to puzzle it
out we're also trying to figure out
uh
how much we value winning i.e max sudoto
add a rooster in front of it or a turkey
tiger fly et cetera et cetera how much
we value that versus how much we value
you know trying a whale hedgehog build
from time to time and possibly
torpedoing part of our run to have some
fun hope you're enjoying the videos
thanks for watching i'll see you next
time see ya



hey everybody we are back um did okay
last time what what if you put me on pay
to win hello tomo my cat's he's down
here scratching my legs put me on pay to
win
i am a believer
in in principle and and maybe if not in
practice but i'm a believer
in the idea
that pay to win
is probably worse than not pay to win
like it's worse than free to play at
least in the mid game but i think it
might be able to crush the early to mid
game with insects and food
okay tomo like if you're wondering why
i'm stalling this i got i got a cat
trying to bite through my denim um
let's let's do this let's do this let's
roll once
it's tough because i love a mosquito but
i think we're going to take an ant we're
going to keep the mosquito frozen
we could we don't need to freeze this we
could take either honey or an apple but
we probably will buy next time and uh
it'll be the bear arms that's kind of a
good name okay tomo
he's going crazy here what do you do
what are you doing
okay this mosquito actually would have
slapped here we might lose like but it's
the first round who cares we actually
are not uh we're gonna lose
[Laughter]
but we lost in team name too bear arms
versus huge nuts okay i think
we're gonna buy two things
we're gonna buy three things one of them
is gonna be food and then two animals
roll me
i love it
now
feed me
you're going to get buffed you're going
to get a b these are all going to get
buffed i mean honestly a 2-4 stays
winning
but
it's like a 2-4 fish but i'm gonna buy
two mosquitoes because we got two
mosquitoes you know that it makes it
easier to get a level up next time we're
10 down on our hp i'm not sweating it
okay this person is probably going to
get 10 wins
but as long as we never face them again
we'll take our win and uh be thankful
for it
now you definitely are going to run a
combination here so it's going to be a
3-4 it's going to be a 4-5
tropical fish i don't think it's
unplayable but it's it's pretty low on
the list
uh hey tomo like i look you're my pet i
love you okay can i can i show you to
the camera briefly
hello
hello tomorrow can i put you in the cat
tree
he's not too happy i'm not sure if he's
still in frame
um you know they call the game super
auto pets i've never seen anybody keep
like uh you know a dragon as a pet but
then you know i it's been a long time
since i saw mulan so
i thought that would be a fun joke um
i would like to roll once
this is actually what i wanted to happen
though you may not believe me because
then
we can feed you
you get a buff you get a buff you guys
all get stronger we'll roll a second ant
for the time being we're going to roll
it behind in the hopes that maybe it
could get the ant trigger go to three hp
and live through an attack
seems unlikely it's a look we might be
about to lose to a horse and we might
not though but i i'm not changing my
opinion on horses this is we're not
losing to a horse we're losing to an
eight-six animal it has nothing to do
with the horse mechanics like that could
have been an 86b and we still would have
eaten it
now we can combine hp is still like i'm
not sweating it yet
i'll be honest i i hate that i'm feeding
you
because we're
not really doing great on the
you know it's not like you're getting
buffed we haven't found a second ladybug
yet either but to get one permanent hp
on a bat feels nice
um
i'm gonna i'm gonna take a mosquito up
to five six
we're
if we lose this one we're gonna be
probably starting to feel the burn a
little bit so we got pretty bad mosquito
luck but
their dodo is essentially irrelevant i
think we win this yeah okay we win these
tomorrow you okay buddy he's just he's
going a little crazy all day i wasn't
recording all day
wanna pet tomo he says no do not observe
me
don't observe me
now it's uh recording time he's like
get me in there put me in the shot okay
let's level up
a 4-4 ant is like respectable
it's really it's tough man like
because i i think that a llama could do
something like we could make a 2-6 llama
which would really be
a 4-8 llama if we're willing to sell
two animals but i do think that if we
sell two animals we're probably gonna be
pretty close to losing
um like i think we could feed
am i really gonna feed you to give you
one health that doesn't seem smart
yeah i think my math is a little off too
okay i'm going to try to run a llama
basically just because we can so you're
not long for this
i would have loved to have rolled them
you heard me talking in the early game i
would have loved to have rolled them but
we simply did not get um
the sorts of things that would be
relevant
for uh the the insects we just didn't
get them
uh you and you give a random friend plus
two plus two
it's scary for me because i'd love this
to go to our llama but i don't think
it's good i mean there's like if it hits
the bat it's fine if it hits the
mosquito it's fine if it hits the ant
we'd probably say ah because we'd like
to peel you in order to get a higher
quality unit in here like for now this
might be okay
i'm just saying this i guess with the
knowledge that like things could
definitely
go wrong like i'm i don't necessarily
believe
um
you know for now this probably gives us
the best chance i don't necessarily
believe that uh
that this is the right game theory
decision
but i do think what the heck happened
here
i do think that it's uh
it's kind of fun at least maybe i don't
know we're definitely losing this one i
would love to see a llama work
so we're still two away from lethal like
it's not it's not over yet um
i think you could probably make a puppy
work my only question is whether it's
too late
pill is what we wanted to see i don't i
mean this is like is kind of sick
honestly
i'm willing to lose a round to to make
our squad like as good as it could
possibly be here that's fine um
with us only being able to buy two
things i think you buy a second bat
i don't have like ocd tendencies or
anything but that just didn't look right
to me
i'll buy a second bat
i will give our mosquito garlic armor
that's my honest belief
i think we probably try to give you
garlic as well next turn even though you
already have um
meat obviously the meat was kind of a
desperation play to win around and uh we
saw how that went down
hedgehog at the back seems kinda nasty
for me
i think we draw
i can live with the draw on this
now what we want to do is i i don't even
know if this is in free to play but we
want to add a bison
we can definitely fit a scorpion holy
um yeah no no no you fit a scorpion here
freeze me
unfreeze me because it doesn't really
work well on a bad roll me yeah this is
fine we'd roll a scorpion at the front
this is a really early scorpion our
llama might be able to make some noise
i've rated the llama pretty low
historically and i stand by that um but
this might this might be the one to
change my words and my deeds like a we'd
like to level it of course
we got a bison
okay um the scorpion has to go
because we need i mean like what's
better level two bat or scorpion
scorpion's better it also counters bad
potentially so like and we want we we
could get rid of the llama but i think
that the the cooler play is to try this
don't don't desync me i need this bison
okay now do not get bison blind which is
when you roll past bison
not not respectable
i'm rolling it's just it's not quite
good enough this is good enough
believe it or not i think i'm gonna buff
the mosquito
and i'm gonna i'm gonna give the meat to
the bat just because i think we want you
to have
probably melon armor by the time we get
you good to go i am
i'm not necessarily optimistic
[Laughter]
i think we might make some noise for a
little bit but we we got to figure out a
game plan to like jettison us up a tier
here this squad is doing what it can for
now and i really respect that but
i have i
have doubts long term
um but that's fine i mean we honestly i
could give you a chili pepper for a
minute i wouldn't sweat that too much
uh you know let's let's go for the
let's go for the the boring play you
never know that chili pepper can take
some units by surprise we're only on
round nine we have really bad scaling
but
our stats are like just good enough here
like this this is kind of a dream come
true we're gonna win another one
uh to get to five with this build is
very nice i'm still very skeptical
of how we get past that but
now the mosquito's sticking around it
stays winning
um it's way too late for a caterpillar
though i'm loath to admit it
the bison absolutely need
both the bison and the llama need to
level up but the bison's
effect is probably less contingent so
i'm gonna
i'm gonna
i'm gonna
level uh work on leveling up our bison i
should say i'm gonna be honest even
though we just bought that for you i'm
gonna replace it with some garlic i
think it's just better off i think we're
better off in that situation our squad
is really gonna fall behind we're we
stand no chance oh we stand an okay
chance just due to the bat could not
have been better
i apologize for doubting the bat
honestly if you're like the opponent and
you lose that one you just gotta like
you just take the hit
i will spend four for a plus two plus
two on everybody i almost hit the
mosquito oh my god i was can i get a
slow-mo replay i think i was like a
millimeter away from
from hitting the
the the mosquito which would have been
bad for a number of different reasons
now you're level two you're getting plus
four plus four let's move you up one
okay so we're at six again we're getting
out scaled
most times
but if we stay winning with good bad
luck
maybe
maybe
i see that we have a fly
a fly type build going on here
okay we lose that
but
on the other hand they had to debase
themselves by doing tiger fly so
i i personally think we stay winning in
this situation just mentally speaking um
melon will go a long way you're our
you're the king of the scalers now
freeze the sushi just in case
i mean rather than sushi
i would definitely purchase a cow and
this time will buff you
one gold for a re-roll
nothing really in my opinion worth save
in there
i'm impressed with this llama squad i'm
never gonna be like especially because
we're in the new meta era i'm never
gonna be like disappointed
with uh with six wins and it looks like
we're probably going to get the seven
i'm never going to be disappointed with
that especially when we're rolling a bit
of a different squad like this means
more to me
let's go
i was hoping for that
um
look i'd love a t-rex i just don't know
if it's the right fit for us right now
um
i don't know oh would you freeze the bed
right because we need you to get to
level three that's the beauty of a four
squad it's a lot easier for everything
to level up because you're spread a
little less thin
a level two mosquito or a rooster
close um
quite scary but look would you look at
this
we draw i don't care about that as long
as we're not losing i'm winning as far
as i'm concerned um
garlic will be better on you but a bison
is a nice fit let's get this going like
what i was gonna say though is like this
means more to me
you know what why not um
no it's fine it's fine
this means more to me than like a 10 win
with a meta build i'm not trying to like
i love winning like if you win with a
meta build don't let me sit here and be
like uh you stink
i'm just saying like for me personally
this one it feels a little bit more
special you know
anyway we lost
but we got this seven
on a build like i've never seen before
in my life that's kind of either that
i've never done before in my life
anyway
just loading back in here
wait i know you oh now you can see okay
so i thought we did pretty well there
honestly i would be content to roll this
squad but let's freeze the ladybug roll
once i would i would put a fish on
instead i'm i'm if anything i'm
disappointed with our early game last
time just be the nasty noses man that's
that's some good stuff nasty noses
just had to hit one ants to like
guarantee our success oh we won never
mind
i'm only disappointed in the last one
because our food build attempt didn't
really work
added 2 3 in here just for statistical
purposes honestly if we're going to do
this we should look at the order i would
rather have a
a 2 2 and
it's probably not going to stay around
for too long but if you know you could
do worse than that
let's go
uh slightly big plays slightly big plays
we definitely win this winning early is
not as important that was like my big
meta shift for for myself personally in
the last uh
in the last configuration of the game
and we will take a bat can't disrespect
it after all the good it just did us um
i just wish you didn't have one hp
because i could feed you and then would
take you on the buff but
i think we're better off with a roll
unfortunately
um i think i would buy you
i think we combined believe it or not
even though it half squads us
because i was like if it was good enough
i was willing to sell
in order to add you to the squad instead
like believe it or not
okay uh i'm i'm like content if we lose
this one to lose two hp to give all of
our units a plus two plus two buff
wouldn't bother me and we might win
it's been known to happen
we were that close
so i don't mind this in the slightest
quite frankly
buy me
buy me nice little eight seven up there
no who says no who says no to that
nobody
freeze me freeze me roll me you're like
actually garbaged here um
four three would i rather have a four
three that can sell for one
or
three three for one turn i'd rather i
hate to say it because i you don't see a
tabby cat too much but
anyway i don't think i finished my train
of thought earlier my entire train of
thought was
my my previous meta
you know let's stop short of calling it
genius but the the technique that
allowed me to win
really consistently in the last sort of
configuration competitively of the game
um
you know
no no no no no no um what was really
just winning early and i think we could
take a caterpillar here uh and winning
early did some incredible work for me um
because it meant you've you had lower
stakes when you faced better teams which
was totally that was like the way
it worked out very nicely
and we win again here nowadays i think
it's a little bit less of like a cheat
code like building good squads early i
think i think you got to use your brain
a little bit more which does not favor
me but so be it okay you're gone you're
staying you're you're enjoying life i
guess we could have ah no no no you've
already got the right build
we need to buff something in order for
the caterpillar to work so i would
rather dump this six six fish that is
like
just not that relevant and then we can
buy a rabbit freezer rabbit we could
sell a mosquito to try to make sure you
eat as many buffs as possible here but
just to just to feed the buffs forward
here is is positive and look at that now
you're stronger so you'll be a instead
of a 4-3 you'll be a 4-4 when we do a
combined next turn maybe we can make you
even stronger actually by feeding you
some more before that happens but okay
so we now we we have a way to enter the
mid game which is nice like the the mid
game success for us that's such like
incredible
mathematics for us right there
that we managed to have like the perfect
amount of hp to get some good work done
there the caterpillar is the way that we
make it forward
which is good i mean it's better than
good
i just like the idea of this
i have no idea
if it's actually good um
but you know
it it could be
it could be
wow it's
you know what we got hp to work with i
think we sell our rabbit
so honestly like forget you we're going
to sell our mosquito which is
deleterious
you know you're going to want to buy a
can
but not yet so we want to freeze our
tier ones that's huge we want to freeze
our tier ones i'm so happy with what we
got here i think we need i know that
we've frozen everything
don't
don't do me like this i need this bison
man don't
don't do me like this hold on i'm
getting i'm getting kicked out ludwig
must be playing
is ludwig live
don't lie to me
i i don't know what to do
could not connect to server try okay
hold on one moment please they don't not
on this build okay i'm just i'm going
black screen mode for a second here
return to menu
take me out of the menu
could not connect the server try again
later hold on now i gotta relog in okay
hold on that's that's fine i'll do
whatever needs to be done for this to
you know not ruin this run because i
want to see this chicken build work
i'm logging i'm could not connect to the
server
no
can are we at that point where there's
like a down detector for this game like
could i do uh
like is super auto pets down and see
what kind of results we get i'm gonna
i'm gonna be like every tech support's
worst nightmare i'm gonna like close it
and reopen it 20 times let's let's see
how she goes
oh no oh no
we're getting just html errors man
ubuntu
html bad gateway no no no
please
i'll just boot it up one more time
that'll probably fix it
no
i mean
i'll tell you the same thing like
that it's telling me man
i think if you see this text in your
game you're having some server problems
anytime you find yourself running into
this issue right here i would take a
second and be like you know
i think we got some problems um and
that's fine you know it we we had fun we
made a llama build work
um for a little bit we were doing some
good stuff on this chicken build
unfortunately we've run up against the
the deadliest error of all
loading loading
no no no
okay bring me back bring me wait bring
me back bring me back bring me back
bring me back bring me back
bring me back bring me back continue
arena turns out i thought we were done
man i thought we were done freeze me
freeze me
and this it's good it's good launch me
launch me
we
like the youtube errors we got a what is
it a team of highly trained monkeys have
been dispatched to deal with your
problem
um
so i i by the way like i'm like out of
the i'm out of sync now right but that's
like like mentally speaking not in the
game um but that's fine because i i
think that we're doing the right thing
we needed to freeze that tier one in
order to make the chicken work better
but
we're trying to
basically buff this bison
as much as possible before you get to
level three or so we can slot you in
maybe instead of our mosquito
we see no tier ones no tier ones is very
devastating for me to see no tier ones
i'm gonna just feed you and then our
bison is an 811 like our chicken's not
doing anything right now unfortunately
but
we that's what happens when you don't
get tier ones in your shop man like what
am i supposed to do i do i do question
oh no wait hold on what the heck is
going on here man
they're trying my goofy build they're
trying on my goofy bill jerry
we won okay that's
the delicious nuts what a name uh i
respect it that that's fun that's fun i
honestly think we're actually gonna sell
our bat
give garlic to our mosquito
truth be told we could probably sell our
freaking
rooster
it's like
i'm looking for scaling i just have not
found it yet
i get you know what okay sell the sell
the rus sell the chicken sorry not the
rooster
um
i'm gonna buy you i'm gonna give you
garlic armor because you're kind of like
you're already somewhat strong
we don't really need this like a
hatching chick is good don't get me
wrong but we don't really need it we can
freeze a scorpion for future use
it's it's a little it's just a little
early for
um
turtle pill i think it's just slightly
too early to really feel good about
rolling turtle pill this is bad like
this is a loss unless we overrode the
scorpion um
i'm just happy we got back into it i'm
disappointed as always that our chicken
didn't work out for us but that it
happens
uh okay so we we need to roll a scorpion
to protect our strongest units
you're going to scale fastest so we
actually are going to give you the buffs
even though there is upside the
obviously having the scorpion received
like some extra hp if we were to buff
you instead
i think we do need to roll
the scorpion
at the front to protect our strongest
unit the mosquito can now go honestly
you could full sail that's not the word
that's a university you could wholesale
replace this
scorpion
replace the mosquito with a scorpion and
i think be pretty pleased
i think we we we draw these just barely
that keeps us in the game man that would
have been lethal that's nasty
okay um okay well actually i think you
sell your mosquito
and you roll a t-rex and then you have
six gold with which to pop let's get you
with one of these
um and we got three extra gold okay
let's buy a can
for the future
i don't know man i'm kind of thinking
it'd be sick if this mosquito could live
through more attacks
this looks great so far
we're is a it's a beautiful composition
we got going on here so that helps us
get a little further
okay
now we have 10 gold with which to spend
scaling is very important now one up
isn't i think um
a a turtle somewhere in the squad would
help
that's very nice i straight up think you
can
and then i think you get like what is
this eight nine oh my t-rex
t-rex buff i got so attached to the idea
buffing the scorpion
hold on though wait no this is still
wait uh i don't know i think it makes no
difference
oh fly that's neat
turkey turkey tiger fly wow cool build
whoa have you guys seen this
whoa dude epic epic for the win turkey
tiger fly
he's just mad that he lost no i love
losing as long as it's to like not the
folded packages no disrespect intended
cool cool turkey tiger fly built a
little salty no big deal cool turkey
tiger fly wow it must be a lot of fun
spent you know what the the beauty is
we might have gotten less wins than the
folded packages but our wins per second
is about a hundred times higher cause
any turkey tiger fly build takes about
40 minutes to run anyway

everybody welcome back super auto pets
we're on pay to win get me get me off of
this stinky pay to win put me on free to
play still having a wonderful time
thanks as always for your support i was
experimenting a little bit last night i
know what you're gonna
say that's what you're supposed to do
when you're in college i'm a little past
that age nevertheless
let me tell you what did i learn
i learned that i think even though i've
started
let's go
even though i've started to value ducks
more
we wanted this order i would have
preferred if this was like a fish or a
mosquito maybe but this is okay
um i think
that uh
will be the
be a precious seed like if there was
only one oak tree left on earth and you
had the last acorn that's precious man
uh i think despite valuing ducks
more highly than i ever have before i
think i actually still undervalue them
like legitimately
why wouldn't i why wouldn't i try this
roll me
i'm going loco i'm going loco okay
i'm gonna we'll roll four ducks
this is fine
we may lose this round it's 10 of our hp
who cares
we're gonna go up a tier even if we
don't get a level we're gonna go up it's
here
um after this which means we're about to
get
plus four plus four on three different
units now they might be garbage but even
if because if we combine we lose one
and we look yeah i honestly i'm a
believer in this process right here
though it may surprise you like to not
combine and try to go up another level
on like a tier three instead of the tier
twos i think like
a seven five flamingo is gonna ruin your
life
i think a six-six spider is going to
cause you some problems i think a
five-nine peacock is gonna drive you
crazy
we don't really want to we want to kill
an ant i guess in the future
i don't love anything about this um i'm
just going to throw out a second spider
for now
i know how strange this looks this squad
just on stats alone is going to be
nightmarish for an enemy to deal with i
think
i mean you got you got a 9 6 flamingo
that just wiped your squad now you got a
7-7 spider your reward for beating that
flamingo is you got to fight a spider
and now guess what there's the 610
peacock i don't even like a peacock that
much but the mid game is like
very sordid for us right now why don't
you go ahead and pill me
it's gonna take a while for me to get
rid of a 7-5 flamingo
um
now just to be honest with you this is
kind of where we enter
the next phase of uh
the game and i i'm very content with
where we stand here just to be real with
you but um the next phase of the game
can be a little bit awkward i think
um because at some point we're going to
want to get better units
uh or upgrade these existing units but
we have to figure out when the logical
pivot point is
and it's not always obvious even though
i just described it as logical it's not
always obvious
that's such bad luck man we were
actually in the clear until you i spit
out a giraffe and or a snail and he spit
out a sheep
sheep difference um it's not always
clear though because sometimes it's very
easy to get like you know
sunk cost fallacy basically on uh
on the existing units we have here
so like i'll level with you i'm i'm
rolling the four squad marty
i feel like
a lot and i don't mind the four squad
marty here just to be clear a lot of our
success with this build i'm not sweating
our hp at all you know like if we lose
this round so be it but i i doubt that's
likely to happen although we're seeing a
lot of the same squads
uh you know day in day out here for
whatever reason um
this seems totally fine no turtle that's
all i ask all i ask of you is no turtle
i think that getting a rooster as buff
as possible is just like
it's one of those things that i hate to
admit that it's as good as it is but
it's really hard to not just kind of
stick with that um but i think we can
freeze a rooster for now
and just kind of huddle it
as daniel would say
i know he didn't invent the terminology
but my reasoning is is quite simple to
be honest with you um
we could get ducks buy and sell them
it's a very easy way to add like a plus
one to something that's just chilling in
the shop
we dude ice in that dog is actually
gonna put a real damper on their run
here i think
um this this is a totally acceptable
situation
so we don't we can give up the
opportunity cost of like a few things in
the shop
if we think
that
it makes sense which i'm not totally
sold on but
i don't know now we sold the swan we got
another swan
feels bad man but you you know what i'll
tell ya
i don't mind this
we should probably make sure we're
freezing roosters as well um just in
case but i think a level one penguin is
kind of unimpressive a level two penguin
i don't mind and you know what unless
you dance with the one that brought you
as long as we get through this uh
kangaroo i'm not sweating it man like
i'm telling you like you might look at
this squad and say it's kind of
unimpressive we you're not wrong for the
record but we are winning right now
literally because of that four duck
round
like that's changed the game for us
completely i feel
i feel compelled
to freeze you
by two cans because it makes our rooster
that much stronger
roll once honestly it has improved our
penguin as well
um so that our penguin will actually be
stronger than the existing penguin when
it comes out this this guy might
actually be able to land some hits no
promises of course but
okay we we punched through that uh
the rhino that's the important thing
rhino builds tend to be a little front
loaded
it's only a level one ox so we make it
we draw i can live with the draw we're
starting to hit like a bit of an awkward
turbulent phase here
but i think i like i'm not
worried about it because we we know at
some point you're gone you're gone and
we're gonna be busting a rooster out
here and feeling pretty good about
ourselves now we got an 11-11 rooster
just freaking chilling man
it's gonna be the strongest penguin
you're ever gonna see are you seeing
this
now i'll admit we're running kind of a
strange build here but
for the time being
it certainly seems to just be doing good
work
so this takes us what
six six already we just got started
are you sure
i will buy i think we might as well buy
freeze me
second rooster okay now if we could just
spit out
a level two rooster that's gonna help a
lot i don't know why i'm investing in
our spider except to say that at this
point like he's sticking around 1912
spider
we're on round 10 sure
killing that scorpion is insane value
we have garlic armor as a result we win
these easily so i'm not sweating this
this this is on its way to
do some good stuff if if this gets to 10
wins this will be kind of a new paradigm
uh for us
i think at least now just think about
this for a second it's probably more
important that your rooster gets to
level two so we can start to get some
penguin buffs
now we got oh and okay
the flamingo has to go
at this point
in order to spit out
four 13 13 roosters we still want to
work well fifteen fifteen one rooster
wait it spits out four fifteen ones i
should say
but uh we got some work to be done still
but this is now like we i didn't know it
could happen so easily but we made kind
of a seamless pivot just by keeping that
rooster frozen in our shop for so long
we made a bit of a seamless pivot to a
better situation like this is a good
squad now now you need some of this you
probably need this but i'm going to
freeze it for just a second here
it's always tough because the steak can
do some good work for you
you know okay let's just accept that
this is how this is gonna go for a
minute here
we're getting nice buffs i would love to
it wouldn't bother me to get a level two
tiger just to start getting some penguin
buffs it's a little pricey but okay
we're going up against a bad two t-rex's
holy crap
we win these we win these that's nine
wins with a whole bunch of room to play
with
now the unfortunate part is we really
don't want to sell anything to fit a cow
i don't really care about pizza sure a
level 3 is always fun
and let me tell you
i'm very
no no no but thank you but no no no i'm
very excited by like what our our
penguin has done for us i'm very excited
by what our rooster has done for us this
is kind of like a banner build for the
spider which never does this well
or sticks around this long to begin with
um i am feeling a-okay right now
uh we might i was gonna say we might
lose this one but we're not gonna it's
actually not even close that was like
cool calm and collected a lot of that
wind honestly goes to our penguin
getting stacked i think the penguin's
not like an insanely top-tier unit but
if you can get it leveled early then
sure
the other credit there belongs to the
early ducks
you may not believe me
it's fine to disbelieve me but those
ducks were doing like that was calm and
it was because our mid game was just
sorted for us honestly
um i just like the idea of the danish
presidents
like yeah i'm the president of denmark
you got a problem
my name is magnus carlson what the heck
we're going to is this the corn pop he's
a bad dude man
hot baguette though great name great
team name
certainly like it
you peace certainly like it roll me
freeze me
certainly like it now do we want to
double sell an otter i don't think so
i think what we will do is buy but if
the otter hits the ducks we're going to
be modestly disappointed huh
well we win these
and it's got a pretty good chance to hit
the ducks and then get sold if we do a
double sell
you know hold on
sell me sell me
buy me
i was gonna do a buy me sell me here
on our duck but it's kind this is not a
great duck situation it's not as is not
as good
as it could have been but
i don't mind just fitting a duck for now
and i think you can totally fit a
kangaroo
i think we can freeze you
and if you're gonna be sticking around
not for long but for like a minute why
don't you just go ahead and take a b
like it gives us a chance
then we're gonna pill the ant but it
might hit a duck
the it's what a twisted web we weave
this could be a draw anytime i see a
badger i'm like this this heavy draw
potential which is fine
but now i'm looking at i'm like never
mind we actually win easily
um but we're not as ahead of the game
stat wise as we used to be
i think you take the chance it hits the
duck
i am not ashamed of my words or my deeds
this is pretty sick man we get some
garlic on you we're off to the races
um
you could put a crab in here and then
some meat behind it
or some meat on it i should say um this
for me is a roll situation and then you
can sell your duck to to goose up your
swan what a phrase
uh i think you could double sell a duck
to double goose of swan
you could also
double sell a duck and then buy a swan
and a dodo so like
i'm gonna say no to the dodo for now but
there's there's a real temptation there
this even though we're ahead of where we
were on the last run this is actually
not as like cut and dry of a of a win i
would say
like last time i i really felt like we
were quite comfortable this one i'm like
we're in a good spot right now but we
need to keep the engine working to get
us there we have no obvious engine like
our engine last time was just like hey
we had like four nine nines by round
four
which was
pretty sick
so sell me
buy me
i'm just gonna do a sell me
man we got a five six one we spent a lot
for but we got a five six one you need
meat we might as well salad then um
i don't really want to sell anything to
fit a peacock i honestly think the
peacock's a little doodoo
one of the things we might look to on
this run right now is actually garlic on
the mosquito because we can't really
afford to dump a 10-9 at the current
phase of the game
but another thing that would help out a
lot
is actually um
maybe like two more otters and then a
bison and then we could we could pivot
from this like stat build we got to a
bison build and and make it work as a
result of that but it's i don't mean to
complain i mean we're five wins out of
five matches so far it's just like a
little bit of a tricky
situation right here like right now
everything's great
it might not be like that for the future
what we would love to see really is just
some units hitting level two or beyond
uh in fact i would actually
invest in some rolling here let's keep
this around this is a just in case me
i think an ox like if it were slightly
earlier i'd be more persuaded but i i
the ox i'm not totally sold on but it
will
at round six but it will be nice to get
a level two mosquito which will let us
jump up a tier
what's happening
i think we lose this just due to their
their clutch mosquito shot
no disrespect intended that's you know
it happens i'm sure we've won thanks to
our mosquito shots as well their
mosquito did some great work there no
disrespect so the otter is the most
losable piece of the squad right now
people always say kangaroo i'm here to
tell you it's not the case
kangaroo is uh it looks like a 2 3 but
it's not a 2-3 don't be tricked
penguin doesn't really fit right now we
don't have that kind of squad
that's necessary
crocodile doesn't really fit but i will
keep it for now i'm going to immediately
regret that decision
um
yeah okay this is
we'll roll crocodile for one round this
is the beauty of having a lot of hp then
we're gonna start to get that monkey to
try to make the mosquito scale a little
bit faster
this seems okay
this seems very good
this seems like no problem okay so we're
i wouldn't say we're back but i'm more
comfortable
let's sell you
buy you you need to get fed for sure not
an apple though come on have some
respect uh
you're probably not long for this world
you need some garlic
so let's start there
uh
i'm tempted to like buy sell
like get a giraffe out there but
i'm gonna say
no maybe we actually just get the swan
to level up
it could happen
now we are
understated for where i would like to be
but that doesn't mean you lose
i was like where's my crocodile shot
[Laughter]
okay oh uh i i honestly didn't think
there was a way we were making it
through there but actually we did i'll
take a draw against a strong looking
team
the swan has to go now
now i'm not i don't want to disrespect
the rooster but this does not feel like
it's kind of build right now
so what's the number one enemy for us
you probably don't even need me to say
it
but um
yeah we got to keep this but
uh
a scorpion is just a nightmare
this is pretty huge so i think like two
monkeys is fine it doesn't bother me
we're gonna make sure
well there's two ways you could play
this we can get a level two kangaroo but
we could also just put a tiger back here
and that'll pog up the kangaroo as we
get into the late game which we're
quickly approaching
we could instead
combine two monkeys this is next turn
combine two monkeys give them chocolate
and then put a level one monkey
next to them thus generating six stats
attack and health per turn for our
mosquito now i
this is the kind of thing you get
laughed at when you do it
on stream until it works and then people
go holy crap you can do that
like i know that it's a little
it's slightly unusual
versus the way that you would expect to
play the game but sometimes the
counter-intuitive stuff is actually like
is actually the best now you're gonna
stay frozen for like our last salvo
we're gonna put a lot of effort into
like a tiger kangaroo or maybe a tiger
snake uh in order to get
that last win when our hp dips
until our hp dips i don't really see a
reason to commit to you yet
i'm fine adding another kangaroo here
really the meat of this is not hitting a
scorpion that's my my whole strategy is
don't hit a scorpion i'm so sorry that
we're gonna beat this sloth build
i like i haven't even seen a sloth i
apparently it's like a super rare
useless animal so it's really prized to
get it to level three for like that last
achievement i don't i don't know
anything about this honestly except for
what i just told you
um
this is hilarious man
and then at any point we can just go
boop pop the tiger down and we're good
to go but um
i i feel bad for taking out that tiger
build and it's or that that
uh sloth build and its moment of
potential but uh alas hey we got eaten
ourselves here so we lose three we still
are two away from lethal like two
runs away from lethal you have to stick
around you're like a scorpion counter
for us because you're about to max out
we could
i'm not saying big scorpion has ever
worked
literally for hippo in my estimation
instead let's just reroll endlessly and
get nothing out of it um
interesting right
i think maybe this is the time to give
ourselves the best possible chance so
combine me
forget the chocolate buy me
you're already getting six six per turn
that doesn't bother me give your
kangaroo a slightly better chance to
survive pop the tiger down behind
freeze me
freeze me
i think this squad has a chance we just
really don't want to see a scorpion but
this is why we're happy to have some
room to play with i do not see a
scorpion i do see a level two uh 50 17
rooster
it's not exactly like my my ideal squad
to go up against but sure more power to
you okay that's well done and i mean
that sincerely
you peace
now the play because we're in real
desperation hours
is you sell the monkey
i know it's scary but we can't really
rework the squad
you sell the monkey
to fit a scorpion and then you buy the
best piece of equipment
and provide it to the unit most likely
to succeed
and we still gotta win twice to get to
10.
bad start mosquito really could have
helped me out of a jam there
you really really could have helped me
out of a jam there
dude we almost got there with our tiger
kangaroo by the way
either way we're gonna stop this one
here but that was an eight uh 18 win
episode
really good really strong ten win
followed by an eight win that kind of
fell off and i take responsibility
and i think actually keeping the monkey
might have made it so that we traded
with the hippo instead of just losing
two units to it but you know it happens
always learning we'll be back with pay
to win next time for now thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed it and i'll
see you then see ya



hey everybody
welcome back to super auto penslets oh i
just started a free to play uh i can't
abandon they'll give me the abandoned
hat
okay let's let's make it work okay i
know i said we were gonna go pay to win
this that's my bad
i don't sweat this man i'll run triple
crickets why not if you lose early who
cares let me dude precious seeds it's
it's such a classic uh name we used it
twice can you believe it
now uh triple cricket
this is about to get destroyed
um which is fine we actually we didn't
lose by that much the beauty of this
is the ability to uh go up a level so
easily so what i would actually love to
see is like a roll in i was hoping we'd
see some ducks i'm just gonna be honest
i don't really care that much about like
getting the level two fish
i i still think a fish is really good
but i think it makes a huge difference
whether it shows up on turn one or turn
two like now i'm like i'm ready to say
bye bye to a fish i wanted to see some
ducks
the fact that we killed unants is very
good for us we'll trade with the cricket
i think we definitely win this
which is nice i'd rather not lose two hp
in the early game even though it's not
as catastrophic as it used to be
um
hello
so
one of these for a badger i think you
could totally run it man i think you
could absolutely
run a badger at the back and try like a
little honey badger strategy
do i think that you could also maybe
make a hedgehog work
there's a part of me that thinks that
that might be plausible
i think you have to sorry i i broke for
a second there um pardon me i think you
have to
uh buy a dog we don't we don't have any
other engine for guaranteed stats as
much as i'm like you know just like you
i'm we're not so different you and i i'm
also like done with like running a dog
every freaking build like that doesn't
interest me all that much
holy crap we draw that's a lucky draw
you need something that gives you like
future prospects and that that's exactly
what this is right here so let's give
let's give a little honey badger i'm
willing to give it a shot
toss me a swan very important part of
this
that's not a swan
toss me you know what i'm i'm at least
happy we got the buff but um if we don't
see a fish then i do think we're like
you know what yeah sell me and buy me
this is not an efficient use of our
finances
i'm happy with that i guess we yeah it
doesn't really matter i think we could
easily lose this round i don't know why
i bought that horse by accident well i
guess because it was an accident
so they they have anti-honey badger
technology
but it matters not look at that we made
it somehow two wins
so right now i think what's neat about a
honey badger
and we're gonna have to say goodbye to
the spider
what's neat about a honey badger though
is the idea that
as it stands it works very well in its
own right
and we're just doing the classic little
by cell here
let's not say very well because i can't
back that up but i think it works pretty
well in its own right
just as like uh hey if things go well or
if things go wrong i should say i don't
mind rolling a four squad um then we at
least have like something
this is exactly what i was about to talk
about here but the real beauty i think
we're gonna
are we really gonna dump a cricket to
make this work i bet we are
i bet we are okay you come here then
um the real beauty of this
is um
if we get more badgers we could buff
and roll a stacked like level two badger
in front of an ox that already has melon
armor on it from us having pilled a unit
in front of the ox to begin with which
is exactly what's about to happen and
then you can basically just roll like a
suicide badger at the front that if it
gets killed is going to take out
whatever kills it or perhaps even the
thing behind it so
for now the way you got to do this is we
pill you
as much as i you know you are a 4-6 but
you're also not that impressive like
don't get a big head then we do this
nine eight
we're very unlikely to get to a tier
three because we we basically gave up on
our uh or to a level three we gave up on
our tier ones getting to high levels so
i think we got to say like that's not
likely
no disrespect intended i think this is a
sell me
beautiful absolutely beautiful uh you're
not gonna love the positioning here
but i think you run something like this
and then garlic armor on the dog the
sheep is probably not long for this
world the swan is underrated like the
swan has a
an equitable share of every
win that you're seeing because of the
extra financial value that it gives us
so i'm not disrespecting the swan in the
slightest here man i would never
i would never
interesting
unfortunately for you you bought a horse
and as a result i will uh
be taking my dub thank you
rooster is very interesting i think the
the problem that i have right now
is
how do we buff it maybe you freeze it
for a second and then to be honest with
you considering the buff that we get
here and then the buff we get there i'm
happy to keep you frozen
i'm happy to send this one because right
now the duck is or the dog i should say
is a major part of the plan
um we'll definitely can
but even though we can't and i know this
is helpful too but even though we can't
we don't have to uh like
put the rooster out right away we can
save up for some future cans or some
future roosters for that matter so we
killed the deer before it could get
eaten by the whale which is gonna put a
real
damper on whatever they had going on
now the whale eats nothing and we get
like the easiest win you're ever gonna
see in your life i will admit like it's
probably time to say that the honey
badger can go it served as a powerful
deterrent
[Laughter]
and uh
that's about it but i do appreciate you
know what it's done for the organization
here
yeah it's pr it's it's time i think i
don't think we'll be rolling an ox long
term but the thing is
it's hard to say no to an ox raid now
because it's it's really helping cement
these wins
uh in the mid game we might not even
need to go to a late game if we just win
in the
if we just win right now honestly rather
than throw another unit out here i would
just can this rooster
i'm we're operating on a new strategy
right now and the new strategy is
literally just
freeze a rooster and then can the crap
out of it whenever you have spare gold
dude our positioning is so lucky
never mind we lose to a cow
honey badger would have been pretty
useful there but you know what we still
got six hp we don't sweat this quite yet
um don't eat any of this a turtle is is
always an interesting hold
these are getting to be pretty expensive
buying cells on this beaver but
always like the stats man always like
the stats i think you could probably try
like a snipe build here
nothing really fits um
just feed our dog a little bit
and now it's funny like before that loss
i was living the dream like everything
in life was just
looking great looking fantastic now i'm
like our squad is garbage and then we
just won one more game and i'm like this
is the greatest squad we've ever had
[Laughter]
nothing could stop us why was i scared
in the first place okay i'm gonna say
goodbye swan i'm gonna buy the monkey
now to buff the dog the swan served a
very valuable purpose i'm happy to have
had it the rooster continues to get
buffed
let's get a little strange let's sell
this ox which i think is pretty close to
falling off and roll two monkeys instead
freeze this rooster roll me freeze me a
scorpion which is already looking kinda
chunky
and we're gonna roll like this is just a
big dog and then many sniper build and
many in this case is too but we got a
lot of space to oh dude the kangaroo
going down is a huge help and then not
letting the whale eat anything is just
like as just disrespectful so we're
really screwing up a lot of sequences
right now
you love to see it
you'll love to see it let's go uh
honestly like a lot of people are not
gonna like this because a level two
rooster makes a lot of sense but for the
time being i think we do our our funky
play from last time
and uh i i honestly just really like
this play
just just to be real with you um
i know we got a lot frozen i'm i'm a big
believer that freeze is not as
unutilitized
it's pretty sure the scorpion thank you
as you would think and would you look at
this by the way i'm just tr let's go
saved i'm just trying to point out
we got anti-scorpion technology going
here which is normally the thing that
screws me up the most so
seven damage to five
um there's many ways to play this
i'm gonna do
perhaps the most basic first
and then
i'm gonna combine you and i'm going to
actually put a tiger behind the dolphin
i feel like the crocodile is very likely
i don't think
we got the whole shop frozen man it's
embarrassing
[Laughter]
feel like the crocodile is very likely
to kill the back unit oh my god let's go
dude holy crap
um
we're gonna lose anyway because their
squad is freaking nutty but that's you
know we we threw him for a loop there
are we on letha we are on lethality okay
um
i think we have to
honestly no one's gonna like this but
i'm gonna sell my level three monkey
because it's funny to me
and i'm gonna spit out a scorpion
you gotta unfreeze something man like
we're
it's getting comical
i mean if you wanted to be the ultimate
memer you would just throw a croc a
tiger behind the crocodile as well but i
really don't think it's actually
relevant
i don't think it matters
so i i don't think we've built the
strongest squad but i do think we built
a squad that's kind of fun
okay very interesting
very interesting their dolphin is perish
a level three rooster oh no
we draw these i i really oh we lose
these because of the the parrot they're
doing the chicken thing very clever
very quiet i tip my bow of the hat and a
tip of the waist to you okay
more power to you that's that's a lot of
fun anyway we deliberately kind of memed
it up a little let's be honest now we're
on pay to win roll me
sure this is a good squad it's kind of
like this is the classic early game
squad
i'll be a warm ah i mean a warm tentacle
is a funny thought but hungry tentacle
is a more menacing name we seek to
strike fear into the hearts of our
enemies it's just something i do
funky pong great name the offensive
streamers excuse me
couldn't be me
not a fan however at least we can buy we
can actually make you into a 2-4 by
buffing a fish which is kind well i
guess we'll move you here but that's not
so bad i really i've come around on the
ladybug a little bit i think it gets
carried
because you buy food so often
even like it's nice that it gets a buff
on food even though it's not what's
getting buffed by the food i think that
lets it hang around a little bit longer
than some of the tier ones that fall off
faster but
we still got some work to do here this
is not your dream shop
i would say you're rolling
i don't think we kill you yet just to be
honest
uh i think we
i think we give you meat roll once
i'll buy a swan that's no question
and then the other thing i'm just i'm
just gonna say it man i'm just gonna say
it
i think you want a shrimp here
i don't think it's incredible
but i do think we're gonna be selling
some things and if we're gonna oh this
is nasty
if we're gonna be selling some things we
might as well put a shrimp here just to
make it a little easier we'd love to see
a puppy
that would that would really help us out
so we like that
that's fine we are going to sell you
appreciate it this is a easy buy
followed by this okay and a rabbit
i think you added for now this is not
your dream squad but i'm i'm kind of
pleased with what we're doing given the
circumstances which like this was not a
10 out of 10 start for us even though we
got those early two wins so i i'm still
i'm pessimistic even now
um like i don't know how
uh we're actually gonna be fine but i i
think that we're mostly just playing
against a squad that's not that good
right now like their their team is
having the same struggles as us um
let's get some food in our bellies i'll
take it it's not great but i'll take it
and i'm just gonna level with you the
rabbit is
not long for this world
we could do a quick
feed
so our fish is kind of our scaler you're
gonna get sold
you're gonna get bought
you're gonna get sold
you're gonna get a hatching chick
i like this
i honestly think for winning i would
dump the bat before the hatching chick
right now but the most impressive thing
we could get is probably garlic
garlic on our fish will
you piece
garlic on our fish will solve a lot of
problems
we draw these
i'm kind of stunned
uh puppy is so i think you could pivot
the whole freaking game right here
i think you could say okay first off
you're gonna want garlic no matter what
we're going to want
two spaces
i think you probably keep a bat i was
trying to freeze that there that would
have been
pretty nasty i think you sell a swan
first
to get this last buff then you sell your
shrimp
you buy a puppy you need to have two
gold remaining you buy a caterpillar
since you need two gold we're just gonna
keep you frozen that's so huge
and we'll stay here
yeah cause you the puppy needs to get
the buffs as early as possible so i i'm
not disappointed with this we are
basically banking on a single unit to
witness the game right now which is
unlikely
case in point uh but i'm i'm not too
worried about it it just takes a bit for
the puppy and the caterpillar to pop and
then it's like then we're sitting pretty
this is a big buy honestly
now we can't get anything else
oh whoa though hold on roll once
okay just just give me a minute to work
with this okay i i genuinely think this
squad can get there i think i'm i'm
you know
understanding again the power of the can
you peace
that didn't even matter um okay so don't
lethal me that's all i ask is like don't
lethal me right now because we got a
great thing going um
nice rhino i would say can me i would
say can me that'll take us to
four we can't do that
i would say
i
i'm gonna sell our hatching chick
i'm gonna buy a can
i'm gonna go down to two
this is how we're gonna try to make it
work okay now those bats are just asking
for some help i know hatching chick
rhino could have been in what the heck a
25 25 pig
all right congratulations i've been i've
been bested in record time that's just
an embarrassment i don't know what to
say uh put me back in coach i'm ready to
go two three is always nice sure this is
it's a dirty squad
it'll be the fussy hats like you know
you ever see a hat on somebody like
maybe a bonnet with some fruit in it and
you're like i bet that person is fussy
look at their hat man
kotor 69 what a what a name
kotor 69
hold on
i think i had weirdly enough
freeze me roll me
no freeze is required now feed me
because i'd rather you be a two four ten
it sounds backwards but i i really mean
this i'd rather you be a two-four for
this round than a one-four permanently
even though hp is important
i i just think
the the way that the buffs shake out
here works better for me i don't think
it mattered at all as we go up against
morpheus orphy is still trying to make
horses work dude i didn't have a choice
is turn two you had a choice your pot
committed at this point sure no
disrespect
but come on don't tell me you didn't
have a choice
we're going to buy a dog you just you
basically have to
um
in my opinion
we get a lot of upside out of it as well
i think
as it sounds backwards
but i think we're gonna buy the bad it's
really really good
oh
okay um we're actually gonna unfreeze
that ant and dump it as soon as possible
we're gonna get to a level two dog
apply garlic to it and get 10 wins
how does that sound does that sound okay
if it works for you it works for me i'm
a simple man now we'll actually
uh draw this round
but that's the end of that
i don't promise you yet but i'm
just saying it's pretty likely
sure yes okay
the dog is getting like the exact
optimum stat distribution too like it's
all going to hp
like it seems like a 511 is not that
impressive right and that's coming from
somebody who's only 510 but honestly
like
if you if i asked you how much damage a
511 unit did and you said five you would
be wrong it probably is going to do like
15.
somewhere in the vicinity of 10 to 20
damage right now let's say
um
so
honestly the ants let's not get blinded
like
we know we're gonna wanna uh pill it but
if we can't get the pill right away we
give up something in like opportunity
costs to to wait for it
um you can keep a turtle around for a
little bit here holy birch
um i would totally be content doing like
this
and then just throwing a dog out here
for a minute and then honestly we're
probably better off on the combine
i know we're rolling four squad here but
like this is
it's pretty good
a six i mean now i'm at the point where
admittedly i wouldn't mind if you did
maybe like 11 damage instead of six but
actually six is like the magic number
here which is
it's actually comical how perfectly six
was uh also a great name the crunchy
streamers
very very funny i absolutely think that
you add a buffalo into the equation this
is like the dream squad i'm just i mean
you're seeing it for yourself i'm sure
but like genuinely it's it's getting
kind of comical
how good this is
so we'll just roll it like that for now
8 24 garlic armor dog is just weird man
like that's
the math is is atypical but you know
what
we don't sweat that too much hey hey
nice try hey nice try you son of a we
gotcha
is there six wins five wins five wins
look i'm just being real with you it's
not
i don't think it's gonna get too much
harder once we actually get the
caterpillar to pop um so we want like
something like this we don't need the
hatching chick we don't need it for
scaling
which is atypical normally we do want it
now this is a tough one because we can
get way more buys and sell well we can
get two buys and sells or we could fish
for one good unit
i would rather
honestly
i think i would rather just send a 4-3
out here and take my like my double
double buff
we need to keep the capacity rolling
it's it's so important one of these days
by the way you're not gonna believe me
but one of these days
that bat is gonna hit the right thing
and everybody who's like you should sell
the bad instead of the turtle we'll
regret their words and their deeds maybe
or maybe not so the caterpillar's almost
popped i i can't tell a lie right like
this is the most
like straightforward
possible 10-win run you could basically
ever ask for
it doesn't get any simpler than just
keep a spot on your squad open and then
just buy and sell repeatedly
it just works right like
i don't even want to buy a pair because
a pair is two-two on every buy we get
like
we get four stat points
for two gold because we can just sell
the animal back right afterwards
like we just to be honest we haven't
even really gotten close to a loss since
that draw we had against those horses so
like
it's going really well let's put it that
way the caterpillar has now popped
it's getting a little comical our dog is
like max life like you got to get some
you gotta get the opposite of life you
know you're soon you gotta get attack
we're gonna
buff honestly like we we kind of gotta
buff the dog still just because the
caterpillar inherits its
uh
it's stats
i'll be real with you man like why don't
you just toss me one of these i'll be
real with you again why don't you just
like sell it afterwards doesn't bother
me in the slightest
i'll keep i'll keep i'll keep oh baby oh
baby
you
got what i need this is a really nasty
squad to run into on like turn 10. you
gotta feel i it every once in a while
just happens you get like the mega bills
i'm not saying we can't lose but it's
like so statistically ahead of where it
would need to be to be impressive at
this stage of the game that like it
it almost doesn't even bear mentioning
like it's that obvious i think
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
to get a turtle to level two
we still we have room though like we
have room to
to improve here
freeze me just in case
like we we really need to keep buying
and selling for our buffalo i don't
really care the dog is is in a pretty
good place but
but like it's maybe maybe we're
overthinking it
we're on nine wins no losses this is
like
i am now saying we will probably win uh
i think that's a reasonable
uh
case to make uh we're too early to need
melon armor
which is a wonderful position to be in
okay
i'll just level you don't really need a
level two turtle anymore
and we don't really need to scale our
buffalo that much anymore either we can
literally just roll this i think there's
an actual
like we we did have a draw
but i think that this could very easily
be a perfect it could go wrong you know
if we run into a scorpio it didn't go
wrong by the way we're going to
uh we're absolutely going to just rattle
off 10 wins
that's
i had fun don't get me wrong but at the
same time that was just clinical like
that's the pay to win version of the
turkey tiger fly but i still i still had
a great time

hey everybody welcome back i'm going to
immediately pay to win i i'm fresh off
like 20 minutes ago
ludwig's super auto pets invitational
finished i participated as a commentator
not as an athlete um because i thought
my schedule was going to conflict and
then i just stayed for the whole thing
because i was having a great time
the winner of the tournament
they got me thinking
i swallowed some spit down the wrong
hole that wasn't what they got me
thinking
they got me thinking
this is workable this is workable um
that maybe
i love the idea of a clean finger but um
i mean that's what you want from your
proctologist right uh a clean finger
maybe a gentle touch what are you
talking about i don't know we win these
though they got me thinking i underrated
the bluebird okay because they piloted a
bluebird to a very skillful victory
and yet uh one way or the other i think
they uh they got me thinking i also saw
some statistical
okay analysis
and i think we'll roll this believe it
or not i saw some statistical analysis
on the super auto pettit's uh pets
subreddit of what like the best teams on
earth are mathematically speaking they
paired them up um in the early game not
not after that
um but in the early game it seems like
the best team you could ever ask for is
some combination of ant otter and fish
so i think we're pretty close to you
know we don't have an otter we have a
beaver but still it's a good team here
um
i think we love our combine
two easy wins to start with but no ducks
for scaling unfortunately
i think we love a buy
i think we love a cell
i think we love a cell so it hits a unit
that's relevant that's fine
i think we freeze a pill roll and then
we have two
slots left to work with here
i think you can roll a spider
but i'm gonna get a little bit more
ambitious i guess give me one of these
and we're happy we have the pill frozen
honestly this this might stick in your
craw a little bit
i don't know i'm like maybe give me two
of these this is probably not the order
i would
i'm gonna stick with but i don't mind if
we lose one here if it gives us some
permanent scaling for later maybe
there's something to be said about this
right or maybe not is the alternative
but i don't know i'm looking at this
team i'm not too scared
not in the slightest we got extra gold
via our swans so i'm not sweating it i
absolutely think you can fit a dog into
the team
and again i've said all i need to say on
dog it's kind of boring but it's also
kind of necessary
so
i think we're going to with one pill
i think we're going to pill
a flamingo here
it kind of sucks because you'd like your
dog to get the buff but
a buff is a buff you know now we got
pills again we could level up i'm not
gonna do that though i think i'm going
to
i think i'm going to pill don't hit the
flamingo
let's go that's that's all i could ask
for
and then i'm going to uh it's pretty
simple i'm just going to buy and then
i'm going to combine
and i'm i'm in love with the hatching
chick here
again
huge too late next time
i love i will freeze this whole shop any
day of the of the dang week doesn't
matter to me um
i really like what we got going on here
hatching chick plus garlic armor when we
get garlic armor is going to help us out
a ton
we got a very respectable squad i mean
we're cruising i i i don't want to draw
attention to it necessarily but i do
feel like we're not necessarily playing
against
the strongest gamers i've ever played
against uh it seems like maybe we're
we're running into the people who just
got the new call of duty on christmas
for example uh but no disrespect
intended even though what i just said is
a little disrespectful of course um this
swan though is gonna
it's gonna run buck wild i'm happy to
have you frozen we'll have a bat come
out in the future
this is a four squad marty i'm not
sweating the 1414 swan is gonna do some
serious work
it's a strong beaver but it's not strong
enough
we actually just win with our front unit
[Laughter]
honestly we got a great thing going here
you could try a caterpillar but i'm not
fully sold on it it's tough because we
need to sell something if we're going to
sell something right now i'm on turbo
mode man i can feel the neurons are
firing
out of water so no excuses
what are we gonna roll here an early
garlic is always helpful
i don't think we're ready to give up our
buy sell even though our dog's not that
impressive yet roll me once
i'm gonna try uh something a little a
little zany i'm gonna buy a shrimp
i'm gonna sell our fish
nice very nice buff i'm gonna buy garlic
for our dog i don't mind rolling a bat
in many different contexts here um i
don't know why that sounded so menacing
on round six here's the thing you
probably could roll a puppy and and have
time to scale it but i'm also a big
believer in this like weird
oh we got two gold left
no thank you
thank you
no thank you uh but i i'm a big believer
in this setup we got here like two very
tanky and strong garlic units is enough
to to get us there even if we do have
two one ones
like these are useless we're still
living we're still living holy cow or
holy swan i should say
past the believer threshold of six wins
already
we're not gonna um sell a hatching chick
although it would give one hp
permanently but the problem is it might
give it to the hatching chick so let's
just combine maybe there is a permanent
future for you somewhere we'll try this
this is the easiest buy sell of my
entire life
need some more hp though
okay thanks a lot for nothing uh or
whatever you know what it's very early i
i certainly do not mind the idea
of now getting a permanent buff on
i don't have a problem giving it to the
goose quite frankly
something about that seemed like like
strange phrasing
like that goose is already getting there
i'd much rather have an 11 12 than a 14
8 and a scorpion this early like
it's just nasty that's that's all you
have to say it's just nasty
we i don't want to jinx it
like this is not that impressive of a
squad but we are trending towards a
perfect game here which would would be a
little surprising for me
but that's okay
i'm gonna we really need hp man it's
really hard for me to not dump a
scorpion here
to try to get more hp as soon as
possible on our dog
it's fine i'm not going to cry about it
if that's what you're expecting i don't
really want another like i don't really
care for a level 2 shrimp but i guess
it's a relatively low cost to do that
you can run a deer if you have to but
i'm i'm willing to be a little bit more
optimistic
no thank you
yes thank you yes thank you
start here
dude honestly i i think we can make that
work
we
geez man um i don't know maybe not i
don't know we'd have to dump a hatching
chick to fit that and i don't look
that's we'll deal with that next turn
okay
that's next turns problem i don't have
to think about that right now we're
still rolling a four squad marty i don't
know i am i'm thinking maybe the goat is
like a sleeper hit
okay their bat's gonna blow us out
that's gonna be the end of the perfect
game um we we just got bodied there no
disrespect
bad difference clutch hatching chick as
well i saw a swan in there you're doing
everything right
okay
we're not gonna roll a goat
we can't it we we'd have to dump a
hatching chick to do it all right fine
we'll do it
buy me a goat no no okay start here buy
me this
combine me it's fun don't get me wrong
we gotta
we gotta play a bit of a different game
here we're giving up permanent scaling
by the way
something i'm sure that most people
probably would not recommend
um
i mean like out of this we don't have
tier fives yet right we're still on tier
four
if we buy an animal like we could buy uh
like a bat for example we get the buff
we get one gold back then we get a pair
that we could spend on anything we could
buff our swan for example
sell the bat next turn and then get get
a cycle going we're
trending towards being a little scared
and i guess like everybody on earth is
just running roosters now
and we're going to lose
weakness is not as good as it used to be
but no disrespect it's just like the
dodo rooster
like you get some new material that's
all i'm saying no no disrespect or
whatever but just like get some new
material
no disrespect okay for scaling purposes
we would need the dog to get this
i don't mind it
anything that gives us a benefit on buff
is like topped or on on by is like top
tier here so you're fish
you know i think we got some time till
we start to see like full scorpion meta
i can sell you
we have one trigger left here not not a
huge fan of how the shrimp's been doing
me dirty here
um i'm worried about running into a
hippo so honestly
as weird as it might seem
buy me a sheep
roll me
sell me
we got one gold remaining a nice little
buff
i think you roll a skunk here for the
time being and freeze a dog for later
now i don't know like
we're running
skunk shrimp goat
this is not what you would describe as a
typical build it's pretty unique we're
running into a team that has a dodo and
a rooster i'm not sure if you're
familiar with the dodo rooster strategy
gonna sell
at this point we gotta we gotta work
unwind the whole run backwards to get
some wins so we're gonna sell the skunk
to get the buff
we're gonna buy a rooster get the buff
get the gold
we're gonna sell this
we don't actually need the dog
necessarily
it's a little late for the bison i think
i am gonna take the dog we still get the
buff
we're at 10 gold that's very nice
way too late for a caterpillar the pears
are good don't get me wrong i'm gonna do
another buy
six gold
i don't think the microbe fits though it
appeals to me it's my my trollish nature
it appeals to me via my trollish nature
this sucks but in order to do this in
the right order we have to say goodbye
to the chocolate and i i'm content to do
so i do think this is probably like our
last stand here but
give it a try nonetheless i don't know
maybe uh somehow an eagle gets us over
we're at seven wins i'm not disappointed
i'm just disappointed that we
get killed by dodo rooster every time
you know if a dodo hippo happened to
take us out then so be it that's just
life man
okay we managed to get to eight
so
the this rational thing to do is to
start thinking intelligently
what is the counter to roosters and i
think one of the answers would just be
sniping
if you can get some early snipes from
like a dolphin or something like that
you're sweating it a lot less
so i think
this is now probably a buy
and then immediately we'll sell the goat
first to get the buff you got to sell
the shrimp too and then you just want to
have units that do stuff for you
uh without needing the levels and the
scorpion is like that and the turtle is
like that
so i don't mind this i'm not happy with
the foods i'm not happy with the foods
i'm very i love a swan man okay now we
can start to think about a leopard for
future purposes if we're lucky enough to
live like two leopards is kind of funny
um you i didn't even stay at three gold
i just bought a t-rex for no reason man
okay what do we got here though my
scorpion got iced by a dolphin the the
dolphin is very underrated like
anti-scorpion tech all right we got
eight wins i'm not disappointed with a
winds i i can i can hang my head high
i love this squad to start with give me
a fish
no fish
i accept my early loss
in order to buff a mosquito this is now
look if the duck works
better in 10 lives
then the blue bird should be there as
well
yeah ironic hipsters
so i i do think i i got no disrespect
for uh
the the run that knocked me out do i
have disrespect for a uh
for a dodo
uh dodo rooster i mean i do and i don't
if you just love winning more power to
you
i lord knows you know i've had enough uh
games of this just running the meta
where i'm like let's mix it up like i'm
trying to if anything just be a little
bit more
memey every single time
that doesn't mean i only lost because
they were running a meta build like dodo
rooster is just it's just good
now this person is going to do some
serious damage later very happy to play
them now if avrony one comes back later
in the game and kills us
you know what they earned it by by
playing those ducks
now we got a early mosquito
blowfish is kind of a there's a little
snooze technology deployed here but it's
not necessarily bad
i for sure think you can do like this
the problem you usually want your best
unit up at the front
which is where the counter technology
comes in here you definitely freeze
honestly
laugh all you want
i put i put this through the computer
brain i know exactly what i'm doing we
we win the next four rounds easy
if we get garlic armor on our mosquito
at the back
easy did i say easy i mean easy okay
i'll take a draw life goes on
we're scaling i know you want you want
to hear the memes so i'll give you the
meme we're scaling um
the
fish gets sold
and it gets sold by
it's not fair for a fish but in order to
make this work properly
we want to make sure that this buff
happens we needed the space for the swan
i'm not gonna you know become beholden
to the bluebird necessarily
but for now i don't mind it
um
look okay
i know there's going to be heavy what
are you doing are you out of your mind
energy here
it's like we're running a dog build
without having a dog no no no no
i mean we this is like a
this is not great
i don't expect to win this round
especially versus custom backgrounds
although i will say this this team first
off cool animal picks great name
absolutely wonderful name this team
doesn't inspire quite as much fear in me
as i thought it would we're going to
come away with a draw we built the
ultimate drawing squad
all right straight up we know the
beaver's gone this is our turn
straight up this is our turn mosquito
gets the garlic armor big ones eat the
little ones we get a little uh
double this shrimp's gonna go soon not
yet but soon
we add another mosquito into the squad
i think you sell a shrimp
buy a bet freeze garlic to put on the
swan later it's not going to do much
right now
now we got a 1410 mosquito what's our
game plan
eventually
we're going to oh
this is
bad for everybody
eventually
that okay you got me that's funny though
eventually we want to get a rooster
that can work with this bluebird i think
i think that's the play
but we're gonna combine these at some
point once we get units we respect
which we are lacking right now but we do
have a tier three okay well now you go
to the front honestly you're gone
you're showing up
i don't necessarily expect that to do
great work for us but oh
very important okay okay
we're gonna keep that snail frozen i
don't mind it so that we have a little
bit of life to play with we need the
mosquito to carry us for the time being
and then the rooster's gonna go buck
wild
that's really bad i only have one good
unit and you killed it
uh we win these
that's a ricky i love that build i love
what you're doing here i love the
creativity i got nothing but positives
to say there
i'm actually gonna like double can
it will benefit us on the swan by but if
we see another rooster it'll benefit us
too
i don't sweat this at all i'm still
feeling pretty solid
so the rooster is scaling without even
needing to scale without even knowing
that it's scaling yet it's getting there
man their kangaroo is not gonna it's not
gonna do what they needed to get done
but they do have they got a nasty team
at the back here we beat
we beat dodo rooster turns out my
rooster's a little stronger and now
we're having a fun time now we're gaming
um legitimately like all the stuff in
here is good
but
that's not the way we're playing right
now we're getting a little deeper we're
trying to we're grinding it out a little
bit
i have absolutely no complaints
running uh garlic on a rooster even
though it seems a little atypical my
problem solving skills tell me this
could work right now
we have a alert we have a horse build
alert we have a horse build this is not
a drill
i don't see how this could beat me a lot
of people think the horse negativity is
like some kind of weird vendetta it's
not a vendetta i'm just looking at the
stats
they inspire no fear and why are you
playing this game if not to inspire some
fear in in the hearts of your opponent
okay we'll can again it can is a rooster
buff
full stop
we haven't seen it yet but
now
buff is important
um
four no okay so we can't take you
because we need you to get the buff
well
one two one no it's not a great poodle
squad
unfortunately
um i really think
like goosebuff is nice but i think we
need the rooster to get
buff as fast as possible
so i don't mind that at all though it
might seem a little atypical i've
explained my reasoning
we'll continue to buy cans and as long
as we're not losing
i don't mind the can buy
we will probably suffer some losses at
some point this level two ox is quite
spooky um it'll probably be right now
but that's okay this is why you got hp
to play with
we got a few lives left in the burner
we will can again and our shops are
looking mighty scary at this point we
could sell a mosquito although
okay hold on hold on hold on
that's a 1414 bison that's gonna start
scaling
look i might not be the smartest person
in the world
i can at least listen to reason
we want that garlic for sure for sure
for sure
i would say we're coming close to the
point
at which you would probably say
you could get rid of the bird
i'm surprised it stayed around as long
as it has level two dodo this crabs like
a menace man oh never mind is dead
okay we're still rolling see bluebird
rooster
very interesting sort of build here
you need garlic
probably you need melon quite frankly
the bluebird is not long for this world
so i consider this a three hp buff in
whatever unit replaces it
um
and we might actually be like kind of
getting to the point where you could
roll one of these
because they're canned up to the you
know what
i'm not totally sold though
i mean we've if you're wondering if this
run goes wrong if we don't get another
win if we get hard stuck at five just
look to the amount of money that we
spent on cans as like the
the ultimate like proof positive that we
did something wrong
we drew against turkey tiger that
doesn't feel too bad there's no fly but
still
so this will now make a 2014.
now we're talking
we're looking for more cans we're
looking for melon i do think melon will
start to pay some dividends here let's
get it going
you need the buff of the of the
chocolate you give one attack
we we have to wait
we have to wait go for heavy rolls
big buff on the swan we might not even
need both but
i'm i'm content losing this round quite
frankly
we sell the
bird
chocolate something
man that that hippo is mighty scary
never mind we still lose i'm sure but
oh the chili
we we would have hung in there if it
weren't for the chili that's a good use
of equipment holy cow look at this
also holy cow um
so we need the bison needs the support
even if it doesn't get there this turn
for the future this is what we're going
to want to see now our rooster is still
popping as well like honestly
a big part of this but i'm gonna i'm
gonna send the buffs that way for now
i'm gonna sell i'm gonna freeze and
freeze and it's not a fantastic role
here necessarily
um
there is a part of me that's like what
if you just ran a microbe behind your
bison we're overriding three pieces of
equipment that can't be sensible i think
you got to look at
you know what let's look at something
like that
the only negative thing i'll say is we
got very wide scaling
and not very tall scaling i love this so
far though our equipment got overridden
anyway but we did punch through those
first scary units
now we got our own roosters
we win these okay i i'm enjoying being a
little bit
they're slightly off meta maybe not a
ton of meta but slightly off meta
i don't know if you even buy the
roosters just or the gooses just yet i
think if because we're on one hp i think
you gotta recognize like it's here and
now
that's that's when we thrive so keep the
hatching chicks sell you can't sell the
mosquito
you can't sell the mosquito sell the
hatching chick
roll a scorpion
continue rolling
that's what we're looking for i don't
know it might be a little late
but it's fun it it'll be fun freeze me
you're going to be a big helper if the
scorpion gets us through this next round
freeze me
i mean i honestly like at round 14 that
might do it for us that that might be
the best play 3434 bison okay we're
hanging in tight i love seeing these
late game compositions we we lose the
the scorpion trade we invested way more
but hold on
look at this
that takes us to seven wins
seven wins scorpion you can go
temporarily there's a part of me that's
like you know what like
what if you just cowed up here man and
then we're gonna feed the rooster
because it doesn't have an engine
i mean like we basically got like a
dragon
just in cans
it's it's unusual but
it's kind of getting the job done i i
think you could for sure run a bat
i don't think you have to i look you're
gonna scale there anyway we we could
spend our gold better
i
you you run the cow for now
and now we got two like 33s coming out
here
i just i like you at the back just in
case there's like a bus which tends to
be at the front so i don't mind this 16
18 cows no slouch in its own right
seven wins it's we're going to go up
against some nightmare squads man just
just prepare yourself what is what is
going to happen here
i don't know how we're getting through a
a 50 25 hold on hold on
we drop we win these are you kidding me
oh
man
what
okay um that's cool
i'm i'm stoked in case you couldn't tell
that's very funny to me why did i sell a
cow i i thought i was replacing it with
a cow
t-rex for wide scaling i'd rather have a
bat quite frankly
i love a big scorpion keep it frozen
just think about it for a second here
okay
we must invest in the possibility of
three roosters that's probably worth
rolling quite low for
holy crap
you gotta try and you know what now
we're rolling a four squad marty here
it's a little atypical but you know it's
not like the cow was really doing that
much for us when we had it as part of
the five squad
the snake is a is a disaster with a
tiger alongside
yeah we lose these so yeah the longer
you get into the game the more you're
going to be playing against nightmare
squads but hey
a little uh a little bison bluebird
rooster that was a lot of fun we'll be
back tomorrow with some more thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed it i'll see
you next time keep on pogging



hey everybody welcome back
super auto pets baby i don't even know
are we on free to play this seems like
free to play to me i any opportunity
any opportunity i get to play ducks
early on i'm a very happy man
it'll be the milky bone man that's not
even meant to be a double entendre
there's just a dog treat perhaps the
most famous dog treat is known as milk
bones
huge noodle brain no disrespect we're on
two different paths
you're on the path of winning i'm on the
path of deliberately losing to hopefully
win later
i would do this
we really the dream would be a mosquito
in our shop without having to use any
rerolls i don't really care if we lose
this round that's just that's life man
life is a highway i never i fully
expected to lose this ramp this is
the kickstart for us okay
this is the kickstart freeze me roll me
one time
without this i still i don't cry i don't
cry because this is good this is great
news
we get three cells we have an absolutely
unbelievable dodo whatever this hits is
great
doesn't bother me doesn't it couldn't
bother me less now we got a six-six crab
that for some reason benefits most from
being like at the front
very strange excuse me thank you i mean
i don't normally love a spider but at
five five i would
i would consider it i'd give it the time
of day
i don't think you change oh
i i don't think you change anything
about this i didn't want my crab to
inherit the spider's hp that's my only
concern there now this is not a
guaranteed win but a 4 6 dodo is
freaking cracked like that's going to
give us a lot of
a lot of headwinds as we that's no
tailwinds it's going to give us a lot of
tailwinds as we move forward
we like this we don't mind a six-six
spider there's nothing to uh pill right
now i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm not
gonna take it i'm not gonna take you i'm
not gonna take you i'm gonna let's get a
7-7 crab cause like i don't know
the alpha crab
seems like kind of a fun strat i'm
telling you nice christmas hat you can't
be rolling horse
in today's modern work a day world the
horse is not to get you there
it's at this point i feel like i don't
even need to mention it because it's
just kind of like you've you've heard it
all before but
and it's just sad is what it is a lot of
people out there just kind of wasting
away trying to run horses we'll sell a
mosquito
love a swan absolutely
i do not mind
feeding the the crap out of a dodo right
now
and if this is where we're gonna stay
like you could definitely try
like whale spider but i'm not sold on it
being like that incredible i'll settle
for a 13 7 crab with garlic armor
three swans i the the run respector has
logged on
that's i mean we won so i'm not trying
to like you know curse you with faint
praise or whatever but i love someone
who's not afraid to roll some swans man
a level two crab by the way does nothing
for you and that's why this is so fun
um
for the time being i love winning so
give me some garlic on my dodo i'm kind
of hoping to see another dodo
um but i didn't though
give me double salad
that's i as long as it hits the dodo i'm
happy
now we could roll like dodo feeds
damage to
spider
and then crab steals hp from the dodo
because the dodo has more hp but for now
like this is a bit of an unusual squad
but we're definitely making it work
four wins only two hp down don't mind it
little eight eight
now look
could you make a turkey work
absolutely
you know what no no no i i kind of i
still like this because we'll feed the
dodo instead
i think you can freeze a turkey and just
enjoy it taking up space in your shop
for a little bit
that's what we're freaking looking for
give me a give me the rare double food
freeze
um
and then we'll pivot off of of giraffe
and then we'll pivot off of a spider
at which point the turkey will actually
have some space to run
we may actually lose this one in fact i
don't see how we couldn't unless we got
like the absolute dream pay out there
but overall i'm still i'm i'm very
pleased with this squad
so i like it i like it
at this point we may be better off
for winning purposes trying something
like this you're already feeding so much
hp forward i think if anything you would
want to i don't know maybe buff the crab
unfreeze me so now we're looking for uh
no no no yes yes yes
more than anything else we're actually
like looking for a rooster
and then we pivot the whole squad to
support a dodo rooster build
34 8 spider
that's good i told you like that's a
scary team that we're going up against
but still we got the job done
nothing special here
i don't really want to give the spider
garlic
but i'm going to
very interesting
very interesting indeed
you could consider you know
what i'm in this business to get weird
okay
why don't you give me a turkey that
buffs a turkey
it's it's rare
and we're gonna be keeping our spider
around apparently the the triple garlic
is going to be nasty here i would love
to see what gets summoned out of our
spider
holy crap a 10 10
a needless 10 10 snail who would have
thought
so we're actually on lethal here but i'm
i'm not that scared of like where we're
at
like i feel like this is still really
good
that's ambitious but i'm doing it anyway
um we don't really need to buff the
turkey yet
what we could actually do and this is
just fun
we could either do a crab cascade or a
turkey i roll past the chocolate i
really
okay um
honestly i'm still a big believer in
this run give me give me this buff right
here
15 14 which is actually going to be a 45
14 spider
this looks great this looks fantastic
turkey's still doing what turkey does
which is very little right now
make fetch happen what a name six wins
feeling good got to the believer
threshold now you kinda gotta go fly
[Laughter]
i hate to be this guy
or do i i don't know i think you do it
like that
i hate to be this guy in many ways
and yet
here i am being this guy i don't see a
rooster that that's what bothers me is
that present
no rooster
i snooze a little bit on that
but i do feel like if we can get one
more turkey man we're just like
no well one more turkey to level up just
to be clear then we're freaking cruising
thanks for the fly the huge rooster
counter you absolutely love to see that
i'm not fully convinced like we
absolutely win these by the way
i'll settle for the luckiest draw of all
time
i'm becoming that which i hate by the
way
and can i tell you something it feels
dang good
[Laughter]
fake laugh fake laugh cringe um you
don't really need a level 2 fly i'll
freeze it just for optics
we need a rooster
i'm willing to dump my crab
to
make a rooster work
but i don't think the rooster is ready
to steal the buff yet
just freeze a nice pair of melons i
could be wrong about this it just like
something about it it just it feels
wrong you know it doesn't feel like it's
quite there we're going up against the
spawn build ourselves here
i don't know it's like i feel like the
rooster would have gotten blown out by
the
by the bus there
but we might still get blown out for all
i know
level three horse holy bush
we still make it i don't know i i think
we lose this
so to to lose your your terminal run
uh maybe not
never mind we win this i'm just being
like a coward
i'm sandbagging
i forgot how much spawning power there
is there okay give me one of these
i don't think we need to take the second
one yet
we don't need this man
we need this
don't talk to me
look i saw the chicken my eyes lit up
i'm sorry i'm sorry
we should have gone for the turkey first
it does make a big difference we also
need a tiger i didn't even see if we
passed the tiger it wasn't even paying
attention might have passed the tiger i
love the dude this is an incredible
build here first off we stand no chance
secondly scorpion at the back is mad
respect look at this the strength of
this dragon
and this is what you deserve if you play
turkey fly we don't have a tiger but
this is what you deserve if you play
turkey fly is to have a a 20-minute game
where you know you're gonna lose
it's what he deserves i love this i love
this i love this let's go that's why you
make it a shorter distance
be the backwards nuts how'd you get the
beads above the frank
i'm waiting for like there's still
something about mary where they finally
explain
they made all these comedy sequels but
they have not yet done there's still
something about mary where we find out
like mary and uh ben stiller have a baby
and the baby comes out somehow with the
beans above the frank it's gonna be it's
gonna be a whole thing i i'll honestly
tell you i think it's gonna be a laugh
riot
we need to sell
the ducks in order to play the otters
it's gonna be weird but it's gonna be
fine the problem is we'd like we really
need like a fish to be in that last spot
but whatever this is good i love that
we're in like a dynamic situation here
we got ducks we got otters we got fish
we win we lose who cares sus lizard why
you gotta buff duck bro kind of cringe
just kidding actually it's kind of based
we draw sauce lizard okay
fish fish
in peace
okay
i'm gonna do a selmy
i'm gonna do a sell me
i'm gonna do a buy me and i'm gonna do a
buy me
i genuinely do not think that worked out
as well as it needed to work out for me
to be happy
but we do have some pretty nice units up
at the front here i don't think we're
sunk or anything like that i think it's
maybe just
i guess maybe this is uh this is the
universe's way of telling us we didn't
have to sell our ducks if we didn't want
to
can i tell you
i don't mind it
always always tempting
always tempting that that hedgehog i had
some fun today with a whale hedgehog i i
think if we're talking about
self-destructive archetypes
whale hedgehog can be fun but i
personally find myself preferring
um
badger in front of an ox especially if
the ox already has melon armor
i you i wish to pill you but whatever
just just do this first i'm okay with it
i think you could pivot to an early worm
pivot to an early worm
much better than uh
no okay sure
um feed me or whatever
i think we will buy we'll just put you
back here then we'll do some
we'll do some rolls
we got the exact thing we were looking
for but it is not at the right time
what do we have here we're at one win
that's pretty not good
garlic does better than any of our
existing equipment against pretty much
every squad but here we are
it is what it is
we still win okay now we really gotta
get this worm popping
who up playing with they worm omg me
there's a funnier way to play that but
yes
you know what yes
this is gonna we might lose this round
but we got some serious like
improvement coming in the future
we're lucky
i think we win this round man look at
that okay that's huge we got a great
strength of schedule there
it's been a while since we had a worm
built
let's give it a shot
i'll buy one salad hit the worm please
it's okay very nice and very nice that's
a good double freeze
i mean a 48 worm with garlic armor it's
starting to get there
level two worm would be pretty huge
though i'll admit and i know there's
gonna be some discourse this is just
disastrous
people are gonna be like you gotta roll
a um
a squirrel in that situation
look you might be right but i need to
see the mathematical evidence of that
otherwise i'm i'm not a believer just to
be straight with you i'm not a believer
there what i am a believer in is that
it's time to probably sell this otter
roll you with the front
place a monkey at the back to help buff
this worm even further
we gotta uh we should have the crab then
behind the worm instead also we should
get off this like sunk cost garbage and
uh
if if we're lucky enough to live here
which we are not going to never mind
all right that's the end of the run
um things things went wrong oh no no
we're still going we're still going okay
we're still going we're still going hold
hold the line hold the line start there
what the heck happened there just didn't
look right man
it's time to get rid of the bunny
it's level two though man you know what
it's the monkey
is great but the snail does the same
thing for now
please please give me a good sushi thank
you
thank you
i was waiting for it
i mean come on this has got to be a
workable squad here 15 25 worm 1325 crab
behind it
i do hate to see a snake but our squad
has some anti-snake tech
uh that kangaroo is gonna be a little
bit of a piece
we don't kill it but oh we do kill it my
math is so bad and then we win okay
four wins
more
more
big buffs very nice very cool very swag
we need the worms quite frankly um
i'll buy one
we might as well keep a bunny involved
in the uh you could combine the bunnies
put a scorpion up in front instead
playing a little loose playing a little
reckless we still i i don't even need to
look we win this
and and i hate to say it but there's
like there's like an axiom okay
we win because you're rolling a horse
and it's not the horse's fault it's the
fact that you have to build around the
horse that ruins the rest of your run
like it didn't stand a chance
worst kept secret in the game right now
is that the
the horse is in desperate need of of
some buffs
i don't think we need melon yet but
we do get a nice little hp buff
why not try
why not try and you know what
there's a very nice buff in and of
itself right there
i don't think we're gonna need you quite
frankly
we're starting to hit diminishing
returns like one worm is not gonna win
us the game like this
hate to see this much equipment but it's
looking okay that one of the things that
we hate the most right now is turtles
for sure beautiful animal a noble
creature
don't want to see them we don't want to
see
i guess we wouldn't mind scorpions that
much
i'm getting a little spicy here
let's go it just had to hit you yummy
yum okay sorry sorry i'm trying to
delete it we have a problem though our
worm has uh
is maxed out on defense basically um but
it's not even don't thank god it didn't
hit me it's not even close to getting
there on attack we also have a problem
uh we lost
all right
we're only 18 minutes in we'll run one
more back we haven't gotten that seam
yet today
i have no
problem
running these two and then rolling once
i don't want i want to freeze the otter
but i don't want the otter to hit
any of these units because they're
sellables man be the gushing fireman
that's perfect
that's what they do
you know what i'm talking about fires
we lose these that's fine you you expect
to lose when you got a duck
i expect to lose when i got a duck at
least
so i honestly think
this is the play
we need to level up next time which
means we need to get an ant or we could
get a duck and simmer a little
we should win this they're stanzos
they're nice ants at the back is a very
interesting like ants at the back is
basically like you resigned which i kind
of respect
if you see a dodo i think you have to
sell
because the dodo becomes so valuable
when it is buffed
you buy the dodo
pill this please
that's fine it's actually okay
sell me
buy me
and then i gotta tell you there's a part
of me that you do this i think there's a
part of you that does that
give me a b
give me a b on the mosquito sure
can't help but notice this seems a
little uh what
i don't know man what do you think about
adding a big rat into the ecosystem
since we're already
since we're already here what do you
think about a tanky squad that just has
a hedgehog kicker
yours
three gold remains
buff me
many people will tell you this is not
the way you should run this
no you know what you do you put it
behind the rat so that after the rat
dies it kills the dirty rat on the other
team which very very rarely goes on to
actually help you
hold on
i'm actually pogging let's go
i'm what if you ran four rats and a
hedgehog now that's insane on the other
hand
unless
sure this seems okay
i always love a swan
i think you can sell
and then buy for the upside there
we need a whale like this is the other
part of this
i think you gotta go
this is a meme build i'll just tell you
straight up right
this is a full-on you know meme build
it doesn't make any sense um
and yet here i go
making sense of it
i think
i don't know
maybe
we want to see weak squads this is not
really a weak squad
but if we at least kill the fish then
it's not as strong
by the way my math was like not right
but it still worked somehow okay
um
do you really roll in like an ox here
you would like sell your swan to fit an
ox into the squad i don't know
i don't know man
i don't know what i'm looking for quite
frankly i don't know you want to go full
meme
we could
sell a rat
no this is it's too much my brain
we have four wins
keep the rat sell a swan
freeze the badger buy an ox we'll be
looking to pill a rat
in front of the ox then add a badger
i will buy you
i will buff you
i'm okay with this we don't have to make
that pivot
all at once the pivot doesn't have to
happen immediately okay we can do it
inch by inch
this seems very not good
that's okay
we actually were only
a couple of hp maybe one hp away from
winning that one or drawing at least
pill me
pro me
i'm gonna need you to pill me
that's freaking cold
kill me
you get the melon it's not as good as it
might originally seem but that's okay
freeze me
buy me
you're gonna die to the hedgehog you're
gonna die to the hedgehog right now
because the hedgehog's gonna go boom
it's gonna break your armor you're gonna
okay
can i tell you that i don't know what
i'm doing
right now
i have gotten myself lost in the sauce
and i love it
it's good right it's good it's it's
horrible
okay hold on are we still living here
any livers in the chat right now okay
we're still living in fact we have two
no we have one to go okay
um
by me
you think i'm pivoting now you you lost
your mind
how do we do this
there's a couple ways okay one thing you
could do is
just do this
you could just do that
or this this is also fine you could do
this this is okay
why not
that seems like a much better layout are
we really gonna say no to a snail no so
we're gonna say badger i would like to
re-add you to the system but for the
time being we got to send some buffs
down field okay
this is very nice
potentially
now okay freeze me freeze me
i have accidentally heavily overspent
this would be a nice one to pull out a
draw on i'm not saying we deserve it
that would not be the case this looks
like the kind of squad we could
accidentally beat here
this looks this looks okay to me
because then we're gonna get melon armor
then we're gonna lose melon armor to
wipe you but then we're gonna get melon
armor okay okay so there's something to
this
there's something to this
we're gonna buy you
i do think we want garlic on the whale
buy yeah
this is important but i honestly think
our ox just needs more hp
i
can't in good conscience imagine that
this is the right play but it's
certainly funny so
let's keep it moving
uh now i'm just realizing our badger is
now gonna die the second that this thing
gets eaten
but at least it's gonna kill a hedgehog
in the process no the scorpion i meant
but it did not kill the scorpion
but hold on
we're out here living
things that should never have worked but
did
um okay
i mean at this point
might as well try yeah
we could do a cascade but i don't think
it's really worth it
this probably won't kill me right
there's no a snake is is insanely dead
please please more summon builds dude
this i don't know this might get us
there
just give it a sec
we smack you
you're coming out
you're doing some damage
you're smacking
we kill you we kill you
i respect it i respect losing to the
honey badger dude i'm gonna run one back
not in this video but tomorrow i'm
having a great time with these with
these weirdo runs
thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed
the episode if you did click the like
button upset a great deal of course
subscribe you want to see more in the
future and thanks for all your support
i'll see you then



uh they're they're dead
um
all right here we go we're back will and
I'll get to six wins or more
I you know could it could be allergies
or alternatively
maybe I just pissed out the germs by the
way hi YouTube that was instant
demonetization
okay I had the last build by the way was
just we got the perfect horse line and
we got four wins
that's it was just my way of saying
horses are unplayable man well you what
is not unplayable is a mosquito
demonetized for revealing the secrets of
piss medicine
[Laughter]
do your own research you sheep I'll be
the
um how's scary would this be backwards
heads
like if somebody had like the back of
their head poking out of the collar of
their shirt you'd be like whoa what's up
with that you know you'd be like what
okay we'll draw these
We Roll
don't hit the duck if you hit the duck
you're a piece
let's go
dude this is the dream start
it reminds me of those those Eric Andre
bits Excuse Me Miss have you seen my dog
oh yeah describe him to me
oh oh
pay the toll is
oh man okay hold on this this is pretty
sick this is pretty sick right here this
is a cell cell
bye pill
you piece
still really good by the way you know
what I I promised I don't know how we're
gonna make it work but for now
I I promised okay
I'm just trying to think of how we make
it work we don't want it to work you
know what I think we roll This for now
and we rolled two hedgehogs next next
time we don't want the Hedgehog to hit
the peacock because the peacock buff is
not that worth it
um for for hurt unfortunately
what we want to do is surprise that we
lose this one that Ox is just you know
he's he's a tank man that's like
Reinhardt
I don't know like this is a bit of a
meme okay like I'm not gonna deny that
part of it but now we got like two five
four hedgehogs
that like I don't know
kind of feel like you can just shove
these guys like right here at the back
and that's gonna cause some serious
problems
okay everyone just chill for a second I
think we're gonna do this
I would also like to we don't have to
buy every Hedgehog immediately as long
as we commit to buying them at some
point
nice you didn't override my my good
creature you love to see that
we won one
are you achievement hunting no I
actually think the Hedgehog could win
it's not quite there yet
and I don't know if we've even built
like something close to making it work
but
we do have a 9-8 hedgehog right now like
with a 3-2 Hedgehog like right there
I don't really know what the game plan
is
I respect the worm okay it's just that
I'm rolling hedgehogs right now
I wouldn't expect you to understand
we win these
bro what the heck what what the is this
allowed is this allowed
freeze me
what
okay this is just chill we eat garlic
the Bison might actually pop too
they got a buffalo that's a smart build
that's shrewd of the Dwight variety
dude we actually just win these outright
this is kind of crazy
anyone up right now polishing they hog
or just me
I can't in good conscience like
recommend this build
yeah
is going to do some serious damage here
but
oh no
oh no oh no your whole freaking squad's
dead
[Laughter]
okay okay now okay okay okay okay okay
by me
sell me
buy no I can't I'm just gonna be honest
I can't because your stats are too good
it's not worth it's not worth eating the
Hedgehog the stats are too good if we
eat it it'll be more fun we'll be
laughing and then we'll lose
we want to be laughing at 10 wins so we
don't take it we roll
I'm just gonna be dead ass with you
this is the way I play
and then we get a level three Hedgehog
we stick a bison in there
oh baby
what's happening
hey Peter what's happening
I definitely think we lose this
and that's fine
oh
you gotta go
dude honestly I think we like sell a
penguin
and roll a cat in the future we don't
have to do it just yet
I don't know you should probably be up
there in first
[Laughter]
match
we got it would be nice to win this one
because I don't want to go to lethal
we are going to lose this one
maybe me yeah
sell me
buy me
sell me
buy me
not funny
by me
foreign
I've never been less scared of anything
in my life
skunk skunky's ass
Imo
we draw these that's fine a draw is a
huge win for us skunk level three is
insane oh no big deal just you know if I
get eight skunks in a shop then you know
you'll be the first person I call
until that happens
you know see yourself
okay we're Eden
this is the thinking man situation
I think we just roll even though
chocolate can be of the most insane
importance you're not going to live
that's our problem you're very important
that's a big sell Buy
even though we just lost our melon
roll me
bullish
bullish
no scorpions
I see no scorpions
the Snipes I do not fear the Snipes
a second Hedgehog huh
delightful
yummy yummy you're already like maxed
man how the heck did that happen
you know what
just because you asked nicely
no scorpions we just want to see no
scorpions
what
I think we absolutely destroy this build
hold on maybe I spoke too Ashley
yeah I think we lose uh easily
God I hate turkey tiger fly man so
like Mal X lupus like tell me you hate
fun without telling me you hate fun
all right that being said
congratulations you play to win the game
of course you play to win the game or
whatever
um
that was our requisite uh Hedgehog
attempt we're just gonna run it back
1616 fly is pretty strong too okay Bad
start
good start
this this is a heavy draw build
the edible sausages
yeah I think Badger Ox is more viable
than Hedgehog but the thing is like a
hedgehog is really fun
like a hedgehog build that that hits
other hedgehogs or even other uh Badgers
you know what
mushroom Hedgehog I'll I'll relent
mushroom Hedgehog could be kind of
interesting
good luck for us
we lose this though for sure
mm-hmm
this is an okay buy sell
because Oz even if we don't respect like
these that much
we really respect uh
a crab or a swan I should say let's go I
don't feel bad about taking you now
yeah I we don't sweat this man it would
be nice to see some meat but I'll accept
this
this is not perfect but a 7-7 swan is
Pretty Dirty
why not take four four Pig I really just
do not like the pig I I think it's like
essentially useless
even with good stats like we would just
I worried that we would get too attached
to it we would be like oh I can't sell
this it's a 4-4 and then I would you
know lose as a result of not being able
to to find the power to dump it
I will say I am going to spend way too
much gold on a very meager buff here
like this is basically just sushi but
I respect it I respect the sushi
we're going kind of we're going hard on
this weirdo strap but you know what
I mean salad sorry salad
there I utter the the cursed words by
the way are we ready to start talking
about like a super Auto pets Expansion
and we've had some patches don't get me
wrong
I'm never gonna deny that the value of
the patches they've been great so far
but or maybe we're starting to possibly
think about maybe just maybe
we're ready to talk I'm glad to hear
we're ready to talk about it
VR via yeah yeah yeah VR
now we're talking dude this pisses
me off because we might lose but we
would win so easily if we just had one
garlic
also like
no I think we actually are gonna lose
one garlic just like blows out the team
that's that's disappointing so let's get
one garlic
don't forget this is like great pill
strategies
what did I tell you
what did I tell you I love this pill
I do what our crab is now better
at the front this is a strange world
that we're living in
our crab actually gets buffed by not
using its effect
now here we go Anonymous
711a6590d83-4415 honestly you lose
because the last person beat me because
I didn't have garlic so I bought garlic
you you lost because we lost our last
round that just hurts it hurts to hear
who's your dad Elon Musk laughs
oh man Elon Musk oh hold on
oh thanks for the buff by the way and
then there's a like the easiest Buy sell
of my life
freeze me just in case
this crab is like
this crab's nasty man
whatever we're pogging
thank you
why do I believe when he's front loading
a crab
I mean like it's a 1320 it's it's doing
it man it's it's doing it I don't even
know we might want garlic on it quite
frankly
I'm not gonna go that far yet but like
I'm just gonna do it
it's not really a good buy me sell me
what were they thinking thing
you can just walk over it
okay level level two deer a little nasty
get a little nasty with it shame my crab
soloed your whole Squad
it's so sad that people would try to
tell you front crab can't work
it's just there's nobody else see how
messed up this is
you can keep that for a second
oh
anybody else have the plaque beach theme
just running through your head 24 7.
oh you're the you have the alt f4 music
running through your head 24 7. okay
okay fair enough I can understand that
it's a nasty Kangaroo Man
of that there can be no doubt oh well we
still won hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
do you think maybe like we got a lot of
HP to work with
you think maybe you could go for like an
insane leopard buff here
and get some Snipes going we've already
you know what though
we've only had one 10 win run
my confidence is suffering slightly
I think we gotta we gotta say no to it
for the time being
though it pains me modestly
I said for the time being like there's
any chance you will ever not be for the
time being but you know
delete ox
yeah the ox is next to go for sure
man math just worked out very nicely for
us right there
at least they haven't gotten fly yet
that's like the only blessing here
we we get a draw as a result of that
okay you're you're right I I thought
about selling the monkey but I like that
consistent benefit we get
and this crab is just disgusting
you could put meat on a parrot and then
start passing some you could do like a
crab Cascade but I'm not a sold if
anything I thought kangaroo maybe could
do something
no you gotta go before we do this
I'm willing to roll four Squad Marty for
a minute
we can afford to lose that doesn't mean
that maybe we should just throw a run in
the crapper but
here I go throwing a run in the crapper
why freeze the snake because we're gonna
roll two snakes next time or two snakes
combined in the one
there's a we got lucky on the draw there
honestly
okay this is amazing so now this is
where you are ashamed of your snake
words we should
you're gone
order order yeah I know order
I'm still gonna buff you I'm gonna buff
you
but we are gonna do it like that then
we're gonna sell you freeze me for a sec
I'm not putting the tiger out there just
yeah I'm gonna put the tiger I'm gonna
lose this one because I move too fast
I'm just gonna own that
I'm just gonna own that we did things
pretty wrong here
the Scorpion does some serious work
hey look at that though
free kill on the
hold on hold on this can still work out
dude we definitely would have won with
the with a tiger there there's of that

Ludwig don't look don't look

why are you playing so fast this is this
is just the speed at much which my brain
works and that's not a complimentary
thing like I think it's genuinely uh it
works to my detriment most of the time
three five spicy spicy
legend of the ten Rings ending explain
honestly like I know I'm I'm entering my
Attitude Era where I'm like anti-marvel
and and cultivating bass Fitness from
the chat anybody who needs the
ending of Shang Chi which is actually
shanxi explained to them should not be
on the internet they're not allowed to
be online
it's the it the ending is very
self-evident
foreign
what do you think about tenant I haven't
seen it yet
so I you're right I do need the ending
of tenant explained to me because as
someone who's never seen it I don't know
what the hell happens
something to do with like the time
travel that's that's my understanding
Explain the ending to the babadook
I am
okay hold that is that the one you're
talking about
Omega low Omega low
I didn't think that was Omega LOL tier
hold on freeze me don't freeze me you're
not long for this world pill me this is
exactly what the frick I was looking for
can live with that puppy's pretty sick
man
the babadook is a horror movie actually
is a song by Kanye West featuring video
game Donkey I guess
foreign
we win these
dude I don't understand
um what's wrong with Christopher Nolan
and I say this is somebody who's a noted
enjoyer of his Cinema
why does he love making movies where
people can't hear what the hell's going
on
like of all the hills to die on it's
just so weird to be like oh my thing
yeah I'm like make movies where people
like absolutely I I love watching movies
with subtitles don't get me wrong but
this guy like absolutely loves making
movies where people need subtitles on to
understand what the hell people are
saying
please I'll take it
we take those we take those we take
those I'll take a draw
it works on his system I could
understand that maybe I wouldn't
surprise me if Christopher Nolan has a
better home theater setup than me
dude this puppy's going
is going say say goodbye to can get your
red slippers Dorothy because Kansas is
going bye bye
this puppy's gonna go wild all we need
is a caterpillar
this looks okay
don't
this still looks okay
still looks okay
please no Ram okay we draw these
puppy puppy
honestly you're going to hate this the
mosquitoes got to go but the turtle goes
first
the turtle is great but not yet
that's simply one man's opinion
this is insane this does nobody else see
how insane this is two one
this this is the best poodle we've ever
seen and can I can I can I blow no we
can't do it we can't do a llama with it
unfortunately but the poodle is
incredible
foreign
Buffs everything the Llama is a four
Squad Marty but
it would get the it's buff stolen by the
poodle or vice versa we would have lower
buff efficiency
which is unacceptable to me
I'm not even commenting on the horses
like you reap what you sow
llama soup
so basically this is a discounted pair
that we can't control who it Buffs but
we don't really care who it Buffs
because this is the damn Squad
never mind we need a caterpillar
we just don't want it to steal the puppy
buff
which means
I apologize to you but you gotta go
we are sending him out here to die but
that's okay
it has to be done so that the puppy can
get the buff it deserves this is a nasty
Squad but we overrode the melon armor
dude honestly double dog I respect that
that's a respectable Strat
any respecters in chat
okay this is pretty much the dream
OMG me thank you thank you that's the
that's the noted reply okay well what
the heck
what what is going on
what is this
we draw these that's scary that's a
scary team
thank you caterpillar
I don't think we need a bison although a
bison F4 could be a well no we don't
really want a poodle replace or
I think we're gonna roll
more poodles will be kind of sick though
sure
it's freezing
taking notes on that Squad that's a
germa viewer for sure
beautiful absolutely beautiful
not beautiful beautiful
Believers already get paid out that
feels amazing
then
I'm going to let's let's Speed Run buy
me buy me
you're getting a buff anyway just enjoy
it
we still need the puppy to get buffed
okay now I mean this is this is kind of
we have 10 HP man what the heck
turkey tiger fly Peach Plum pear Joanna
Newsom build spotted
hey guess two eight nine six zero zero I
can't really blame you honestly for like
refusing to log in when you roll turkey
tiger fly like nothing but respect
for the fact that you want to maintain
your anonymity in that situation
I can totally understand like why you'd
be ashamed for people to be able to like
connect your real identity to the fact
that you'd just play this game to
um I don't know
build up your self-esteem
um we can sell our beetle
adventure racing
two
roll a scorpion
and we can all we're almost in
you can spend all your gold territory
I think we might actually be and you can
spend all your gold territory
at the very least we are now in spend
all your gold territory if we lose this
round I'm not sweating it
beautiful anti-scorpion technology nice
scorpion just kidding
there's seven wins okay Beetle adventure
racing great game great game I don't
know I only played it one time at a
birthday party that's one of those
birthday tier games for me
and then like everybody else knew where
all the shortcuts were at the birthday
party so I was just there like looking
like a damn fool with my pants on the
ground
got my hat turned sideways etc etc
double T-Rex next turn
so yeah at the birthday party I was
stepping out the damn shower like can I
help you
oops turns out my bat owns
please please
why buy more scaling
better put your red slippers on Dorothy
because Kansas is going bye-bye
does that answer your question
not at all good
that's from The Matrix
oh my God bro really like
hey
and you still lose
I hope you're having fun with the
world's most boring build you just got
your ass beat
every time that happens that's a win for
the entire player base of Super Auto
pets
maybe someone will think twice before
they run that in the future
okay we're on nine wins with a lot of
room to play with level three bat would
really hit the spot
I don't even know what I'm looking at
here which means I I am a respecter
the Run respect or has logged on
no disrespect you gotta you got a level
two 10-9 fish
honestly you have my respect
we have to roll a turtle
we just have to figure out how
it wouldn't be the worst thing in the
world to get some melon
I think you gotta go
you've been very helpful for us by the
way thank you
and you can spend your gold all the way
down this time but I really only want to
do it for melon armor
okay this is we lose this run we're
still alive and then we got double
melons to pop next time I don't know
maybe consider throwing a microbe in
there as well
this is 10 wins like we we may lose this
one but this is going to be a 10 win run
we have like the perfect setup for it
override that stake
uh we actually needed to override the
melon my mistake holy crap we have one
HP
oh well oh that's how good skunk is all
right
skunk level three pay out the Believers
I think we got one more in us to
possibly two more in US
before we play inscription
I just want the inscription lovers to
know first off we're gonna play it so be
quiet
also it's really good so like be quiet
but then secondarily like every time
will be the loose glasses every time I
start the stream of Super Auto pets
legitimately in my heart of hearts I
believe
that I am only going to play it for like
an hour and a half
you know like when George Costanza gives
Jerry the uh this is an anime reference
when George Costanza gives Jerry the
secret to beating a lie detector test
where he says Jerry it's not a lie if
you believe it because Jerry's been
watching Melrose Place but he doesn't
want the police officer to know that
he's watching Melrose Place because it
would be embarrassing for him to be
watching it
um that's how I feel about Super Auto
pits like it's not a lie because I
believe that I'm not gonna play three
hours of it and then I play three and a
half
send me
that's insane that's insane I'm cracked
no I love winning
also I love gold
the smell of it the taste of it
this is not even close
it's your boy Balzac
balls act like a coffee roaster or
something
it was kind of close wrong
actually it was closer than I thought it
would be I'll admit
I love a bad man you know what okay fine
you convinced me
balls ax is a coffee chain
they gotta change that name man
like I get it you were there for like a
hundred years and then all of a sudden
like you're getting memed on it doesn't
feel right then you should have to
change but like
I'm sorry to tell you that in the real
world sometimes that's gonna happen
foreign
people come in now you know what
maybe you're right
maybe you're right
I don't think you need a caterpillar
here
you do need garlic like garlic is going
to absolutely change the game for us
I don't see the Believers not getting
the pay out here like this is kind of
absurd
how are you going to get through a 14-13
fish
I know you were gonna say melon armor
well how'd that work out for you
all skill baby all skill
by the way
I don't know if I want to invest more in
this bird
I don't think we do
on the other hand no you do this
there you go there you go honestly I
kind of want a puppy again for scaling
but I'm gonna let's meme it up a little
bit let's meme it up a little bit
should the 19th century novelist Ono Ray
Balzac also change his name I guess it's
a little late for him because he's
probably dead right is that the joke is
that the joke is that he's dead
it's a good build
everybody hold on
you gotta get a poodle
I am going to sell my bat
I'm going to sell my bluebird
I want this one to get the Buffs dude
you know what you abs absolutely could
try an eagle on this build
I I believe you sell your bed you buy an
Eagle Fly Like an Eagle and then buff
buff buff buff buff buff buff buff buff
we got a very Cosmopolitan Squad full of
Buffs
we freeze you
I think we freeze a bison knowing you're
going to get to level three we're gonna
sell a hatching chick we're going to
accept that the Bison is going to steal
the poodle buff and we're not going to
care
I'm gonna care
you can now be here by the way
the stats are kind of sick
foreign
why do you sound like a character from
American Pie
I don't know that's rude that might be
like your real name I apologize
why are you running a horse I take my
apology back I rescind my apology
kushberg is such
we're not saying goodbye to the eagle
absolutely not say hello to the eagle
because Kansas is going bye-bye
okay
hatching chick had the go two poodles is
kind of sick but we need a bison out
there
so we buy the Bison we bite a fish
we buy the poodle we get another poodle
please
we have no space for you
I'm sorry to say
Eagle to the front in case of Mammoth
that's pretty smart actually that's
pretty smart
is that our believer payout
no one more
you go to the front
you're going to get some sick Buffs but
it's going to take a minute
I'm still gonna feed you though because
you're getting the Buffs
you're gonna be the the the buffer
extraordinaire
Bruce for short freeze me
chocolate is insane
Lee important
yummy okay we need garlic or Melon on
our bison
they got a nasty Squad but it's not it's
not quite there yet
it's not quite there yet
we win these 25 rabbit did you see that
can you please use your influence to
bully the devs into having
hats on the food as well you know what
that's an interesting thought I hadn't
considered that
hats on the food huh
you know what I I don't have that kind
of pull
but if I did if I did it I might
consider doing it
I'm presently trying to use my meager
amount of influence to just get the game
nominated for Game of the Year at the
game awards unfortunately uh there's too
many uh sequels to double fine games
from 14 years ago to to have it apply
it's it's a little sad but you know
maybe next time maybe next time
foreign
someone's gonna need some melon like
you're not really getting that strong
but you're still gonna need it you know
why not I guess
why you gotta Rose psycho knots I mean
look
I'm not saying Psychonauts is not
Psychonauts 2 is not a great game I'm
simply saying all of the games nominated
for indie game of the year are not as
good as super Auto pets Ergo there are
no sacred cows I will continue to to
make my point known you're rolling a
horse
is round 12.
you can't make a horse work in this
situation it's not it's not tenable
yummy okay
I just can't imagine
I just can't imagine yeah yeah okay
level two
dude we actually might get like an eagle
achievement here that is cracked
we have seven gold
give me a buff now pill the eagle
genius
this is kind of sick man I don't know
this squad I don't I really don't feel
like it has the ability to get the job
done but I don't know maybe I'm
incorrect okay you know what it's tiger
turkey but at least it's not fly
I put some respect on this mostly
because we won but at least like tiger
turkey doesn't take 25 years to finish
foreign
Eagles
any Eagles fans in chat anybody in chat
like for example on a long desert
highway Cool Wind in my hair or whatever
Eagles overrated as heck I'm not a I'm
not a big eagles guy
oh no you almost killed my poodle yo
that's 10 wins baby
I'm trying to think like there's a
couple of Eagles songs I do not dislike
I'm more of a running down the road
trying to loosen my load kind of guy
I've always been more of a honestly like
straight up I'm like a Doobie Brothers
guy like what a Fool Believes is is
incredible
how does Michael McDonald have a voice
that's so low
And yet when he gets to the chorus it
goes so high
oh it taken it to the streets man taking
it to the no evil around here anyway
we're running one more
[Laughter]
China Grove oh man talking about
whoa whoa we'll be the sniffing beavers
inscription is common okay
he do be loving the Doobie Brothers
when you have a 10 win like that you
can't stop like
it's just it's it's free real estate or
whatever
I need to spend nine gold
hello mouth would you like some lessons
from sap mastermouth dude mouth I'm I'm
stoked for you I I've been told you've
been having some great games
and by been told I mean like been told
by you on your Twitter account
the freeze thing could be handy
mouth are you gonna take that from Chad
they're they're talking smack about your
wins per minute
many mouths are saying this many mouths
are saying this not just one many
it's true
this is incredible
foreign
I'm gonna say freeze me
freeze me
roll me once
we had to see we just had the seat then
you're gonna feed me
and then you're gonna you're gonna buff
me
and then you're gonna Goose me we Goose
them a little bit
this is not even close what is this team
Swan and a pill in the same shop it's
meant to be
I mean if you're offering
hold on we're taking them to the streets
here
you know we could use a turtle
if if a turtle has to be used it could
be used
Molly Molly Molly let's go
streets 112.
sup NL any Sufjan Stevens today
you know you can make this sufjune
Stevens uh songs into like the the same
as like um you know what I oh we lost 26
Savage you know the uh Dean Norris meme
where he's happy and then he's unhappy
you can do that with like Sufjan
Steven's songs too you know some of the
songs are like exalted
but then some of them are like
look I hate to reference my own joke but
the uh
the joke I said where I'm feeling more
Melancholy than Sufjan Stevens writing a
song about how he
had a wet dream but he still loves God
is like
it's true
so many of Sufjan Stevens songs are just
absolutely immersed in masturbatory
guilt
okay give me one of those
give me one of these I'm not taking that
Turtle yet
I'll take this
I'm not talking Julian Stevens he's
incredible
Pitchfork media said he had the best
album of
2006 with Illinois come on feel it
this it is they remember that time my
mom left me at the movie store I feel so
sad about it still and then at the end
of the song like somehow also by the way
it's actually been about like James
Madison the whole time he's like my mom
left me at the at the movie store but
also like you know
something about how James Madison wrote
the you know
part of the Federalist Papers
holy Birch okay sure get out of here
your ass you're not ass
you're good you're good
the history buff has logged on
and his name is sufian
apparently the J is is finessed
I'm telling I maybe this is the the
belief that is most ridiculous that I
still Harbor but I still believe sufian
Stevens is going to finish all 50 states
I know like he did Michigan
and then he took like two years to do
Illinois and it was a masterpiece and
then he hasn't done any more since
but he's only got 48 to go
I have the utmost confidence that he can
get there
he hasn't even done any of the cool
States yet like you could you imagine
what what uh sufian Stevens Louisiana
album is going to be like
yeah I know that's literally yakety
Sacks on a banjo
we gotta roll Caterpillar by the way
nobody is talking at all
about
the run and that's okay that's how you
know you got a good run we're selling
you because the swan is a beautiful
scaler and I don't think we're at risk
of death
as a result
we keep our beautiful scalar if things
get rough
that's where we we may be considered
being ashamed of our words and our Deeds
but for now like
foreign
I'm loving it what would Maine be
there's all sorts of stuff it'd be like
oh somebody died in Maine you know
during uh like the colonial era and then
you'll be like you'll hear the song and
you'll be like this shit's stupid as
hell and then like 90 seconds later
you're gonna be a mess like a puddle
you're gonna be in tears
crying for some like you know 17 year
old settler girl that died a
tuberculosis in 1791. you'll be like
she's just like me
for real
I love sufian Stevens man I'm not I'm
not these are not messages from a hater
these are messages from a respector
I'm rolling I want to get that swan
they don't want me to get this one
we love that we love that for us
I'm already in tears from the lack of
inscription oh no oh no it's gonna take
me another eight minutes until I can
backseat him and tell them all the
things that he's doing wrong all the
time oh no this is so sad for me
okay good that's we love that we love
that
we can we can freeze that but I don't
think we have to not yet
eight minutes copium okay you know what
you might you might be right about that
but we love this okay oh my God man oh
my God
that's pain
this is a great team pan play this is a
great I I I'm the respector again I love
this team it just blew us out for one I
love a mid Squad scorpion
that's incredible
mid-squad scorpion is when you play as
Donkey Kong in Smash 64 and you do the
Donkey Kong forward throw in the little
cubby on sector Z where you just throw
them you throw them you throw them at
the wall you throw them and catch them
throw them and catch them throw them and
catch them then on like your sixth catch
they just put the controller down and
they go okay do whatever you're gonna do
then you back throw them off of the
stage and they go whoa they grabbed the
controller they they try to get back on
as they land because in 64 they didn't
have like the landing you could do where
you got an iframe you grab them you
throw them into the sector Z thing again
so they bounce right back into your
hands they put the controller down then
you throw them off the edge it's it's
just pure reads that's sleep OG sleep OG
please thank you thank you write that
down
I'm not rolling a swan I mean a scorpion
it's unnecessary
honestly you need the help man more than
anything else you need the help
especially with this much HP remaining
the brain Destroyer
this feels like a second last run kind
of run oh baby oh like the sounds of
that
oh man okay we lose these hold on what
are we at we're at eight seven six holy
crap
we're getting bodied out here
I mean you can sell a hatching chicken
anytime
we do need a total
Squad needs a total big time
this bison's kind of popping huh
wait we can't this is our lethal run
this is scary man sell the ladybug no
it's not that scary freeze me and
squeeze me sniffing noses versus
sniffing beavers
okay
this is good
yes

please
oh baby oh baby this is the kind of run
you run up against this you actually
just Rage Quit Super Auto pets for the
night
there are two scorpions really two
scorpions they need the Nerf scorpion so
you can only have one per Squad two
scorpions
the only thing I will replace
a scorpion with is a turtle
if I see a turtle I would say yes
That's it man that's it
I don't see one
I don't see I mean you know what maybe
we'll go up to a level two scorpion next
time
now we can sell our we can run triple
scorpion if we win this one
holy crap what the heck
it's a really bad time to have 49 as
your stat
s we oh my God man holy cow
what a great run
anyway we'll pay out the Believers we
have 14 minutes with which to do one
more episode and this is it
where are we at here
put me back on free to play there's
Hedgehog potential
there's Hedgehog potential
an episode is two runs correct well you
know hold on lazy eyes great name great
name don't tell me to f off

okay we lose these
foreign
you know what three answers too much
stay cool Chad don't make him hate
inscription that's it we're on like a
we're on thin ice but I understand it's
it's a double-edged sword
the Lesser I play inscription the more
people get annoying about it
which makes me want to play inscription
less
if there's like a there's a smugness
paradigm associated with it hold on this
is important hold on
hold on
you can definitely buy a bunny hold on
you can definitely combine these you can
definitely roll this I do not I do not
sweat this
we can definitely peel you
just in case that's interesting that's a
Mia culpa for chat that's a Mia culpa
a whale with a hedgehog we can get our
team extremely tanky like this whole
Squad dies the Hedgehog whale
okay we're gonna do it then
it's nice that he gets a buff before he
dies
whoa
I don't know why I said it like that but
what
man
wow oh okay okay honestly like you need
to live so let's even though the doc is
gonna die in the process here the duck
is not here for his prowess in battle
the duck is here for for his prowess in
the shop
um oh that Blowfish a little spooky here
though not not denying the spookiness
here it's all right he was going to die
to the Hedgehog anyway
awesome
all right we draw these we draw these
duck whatever
don't care didn't ask
why don't you take one of these
I think it's time for you to go
ah
I think you live man
this never works respect the Hedgehog
disrespect the Blowfish
do it we're busting your melon armor
wide the frick open
and then we're losing our melon that's
fine look at that there's
whole damn squads getting put on trial
here get owned get owned okay we're
pogging we're pogging
foreign
we need a pill
but then what are we going to pill
it can't be the Hedgehog
freeze me
I guess we got a pill a fish in the
future
I don't mind that I've come around on
that idea
sure
pill the Hedgehog I can't peel the
Hedgehog guys I'll get in trouble
this guy's this is a guaranteed one
thousand percent stream sniper built the
perfect Squad to Own Me
rude rude and unfair
and yet we will be the ones doing the
owning
why do you have to pill
I never had a choice
um no I just like honestly it's a big
it's a big play to pill
give you guaranteed melon armor so you
don't get that close to lethal
I mean four Squad Marty never heard
anyone
what the heck
no no no no no no no no
no
what the
the bee
okay well played well played we got four
HP left
sneeze coming on for sure
what did I tell you for sure
oh baby now we're talking bless you
thank you thank nobody said bless you
but thank you nonetheless what do you
what do you think what do you think
about what do you think about this what
do you think about this son of a gun
right here
what do you think about that son of a
gun
I think it's bad
Source dude just trust me
all right something went wrong
but we won
what's the current meta I don't know use
a hedgehog
that's that's the current Meadow for me
let's do some mathematics
if we ran a tiger behind our whale
it would spit out two hedgehogs
yes
I don't even know how to think of it
honestly but I think you wanted to be
at the very back
but wait wait hold on won't it eat two
units
it will eat the dodo here
okay
I'm going to stall temporarily
we're gonna look for another unit to to
Cozy up with at the front there
this definitely seems like my whole team
dies
let's run it this should be fun
[Laughter]
sure okay I mean this seems very
anti-turkey build which is nice
what the heck
all right we lost but that was kind of
fun
foreign
I put my faith in the hog
I see no garlic
foreign
I have garlic you don't have garlic I
have garlic what happened to my second
whale
all right we lose these what are my
second Hedgehog
because the tiger was killed by my first
Hedgehog all right well okay
all right that was a fun one nonetheless
slash Margaret sap all right we're gonna
go



and then
let's let's go back to the free to play
yeah tropical fish was doing some good
stuff there too
let's go back to free to play
start the start the arena start the
prediction
i gotta say too i i went to bed like 20
minutes early last night
because the uh
android version of the game was not
like available
it just kept saying checking firebase
dependencies so i was like [ __ ] it i
guess i'll just go to bed at like 10.
[Laughter]
oh no now we're talking duck at the back
dude this is me i'm like a sniffing
banana right now
recovered from your extra long stream
yesterday yeah maybe this
maybe that's why like uh i'm feeling a
little bit under the weather today is
because i streamed so long yesterday
i mean what we were live for like five
hours plus 40 minutes
oh man
geez no wonder i'm feeling run down
um you you can roll the otter and just
pray it doesn't hit the duck you're a
piece
i mean surely it wouldn't happen twice
okay there's comedic timing
i don't mind selling a duck anyway i
mean but honestly the duck's kind of
chilling right now two three there's no
disrespect meant there
i think we win these
you gotta i look be mad be mad don't
care okay you gotta roll a dog
if you see a dog this is the one thing i
want to say because people always go
like oh you can't roll a dog you a dog
again dog dog if you see one early you
gotta take it
just because it's the first scaling
engine that actually shows up if you
don't take it like you're you're playing
with fire
now the good thing is we can roll
anything else with a dog
like we this doesn't mean we're not
gonna roll hedgehog build if anything
having more reliable sources for hp
probably means we're more likely to roll
hedgehog builds
because we got this beautiful little hp
just chilling right now this squad's
kind of sick though we we're gonna lose
really badly to people who ran duck meta
but still
i don't think this is duck meta i think
this is just snail meta
we draw these that's actually like
merciful
don't lie to me walt
please don't hit my
fish
let's go i thought it was gonna hit the
fish i was about to get real cheesed
don't hit the fish
i accept this
and substitute my own you know what i i
don't know what's going to stick around
let's assume that maybe the otter is
going to stick around a little longer
because it has a nice buff potential
just waiting there for us
roll a little cricket at the front nine
seven ten six come on
and now the last few episodes of isaac
were very pog filled thank you
thank you i uh
i don't know what's like i i'm i'm
choosing violence in every isaac episode
i i still can't believe i like blacked
out during that whole rant about james
corden i don't even really dislike the
guy that much but like
i mean i don't just like the guy at all
i just dislike his content
[Laughter]
and how popular his content is which is
not even really fair
honestly dude send me a badger why not
let's get funny with it and then let's
honestly like sell this three-four fish
that sucks
and then i'm just gonna do a buy sell
make our dog a little stronger honestly
and then we can still roll a cricket at
the front
and then i don't even remember
yesterday's episode
i was just oh you know i was going off
on the game awards and then i had a
little remorse afterwards because i was
like look jeff keeley's just doing his
best to bring gaming to the masses but i
did when i looked at i just get pissed
off with
sorry sorry uh hold on this is this is
an important moment for everybody
involved here we need to get this ox
going
beautiful then we sell that okay
i just like i i we've reached the point
of like in the the the games they get
nominated for like indie game of the
year anymore like i'm not saying they're
not good because that's not fair but
they're not like brave
okay like some of them i i like to be
fair but
i'm basically just mad at nothing so
let's just preface it there but it's
always like
a few games that i think are genuine
masterpieces and then a lot of like
indie game studio tried to make big
triple a sony third-person action style
game but like with emotion attached to
it as well and i'm like i don't want
that just nominate super auto pets it's
the most addictive game of the year
they did nominate inscription which is
deserved don't get me wrong that's
like the fact that super auto pets is
all it's getting like a ground swell of
attention from streamers and everybody
that appears to be in the
you know traditional press is like i can
hear you but i won't i'm like why are
you missing out why are you missing out
it's free
anyway sorry sorry
dude i just like i'm i'm not mad or
whatever but like
our dog needs some hp
it's decent fun but game of the year i
don't think so does nobody else see how
absolutely freaked this is what the heck
my game crashed game of the year edition
i don't think so
oh no no we're back we're back
you know i mean your glory forgive me
you're gonna get me started on like this
same thing that i always talk about
which is like there's a fallacy not in
my opinion it's a fallacy not just in
games uh press but also with the
consumers that like nothing with a story
can or nothing without a story can ever
be game of the year
and i'm like
bro games that's the beauty of games i'm
not saying story based games can't be
amazing but they also have this cool
mechanical layer
i get it at the oscars you would
probably not be like oh the movie with
like the best cinematography should win
best picture every year but for me like
games most of the fun comes from
mechanics which is why i look at a
situation like super auto pets and i'm
like so put some respect on this game's
name
hold on i'm i'm the thinky right now you
gotta try this please give me 9 hp oh my
god oh my god
does nobody else see how absolutely
fricked this is now what am i all that
just to roll a slightly stronger
badger like what's wrong with me okay
definitely
def juice me
okay okay this could still work
no it's not an ego thing
like honestly the less people that
appreciate super auto pets the better it
is for me on like a analytics level i'm
just like you know
stop nominating like 7 out of 10 indie
games that
would have made you cry if you could
still feel
something look this needlessly rude
[Laughter]
okay i mean 23-8 okay fantastic
fantastic really we love to see that we
love to see that i mean something like
that 24 and 8. okay no problem
uh freeze a spider that's a big just in
case copium energy yeah i'd rather have
a
rather have a rather one of those out
there i guess you know what you gotta
buff the dog here then we just hope we
don't get sniped
like i get the idea that people like
look at this and they say like
i don't put respect on that game's name
because the art is literally just a
bunch of emoji
but like get over it
[Laughter]
okay we definitely lose this round
we got two we got two left anyway
this year was kind of a weak year for
games yeah so like they should nominate
super auto pets because it's a great
game
you lost that because of the mosquito
snipe oh are you kidding me man
because of the mosquito snipe on my
monkey no give me a crocodile for now
we have no level twos that's a sad story
the dog needs the buff i like this is
upsetting to me
but i do think it kind of needs to be
done
this is a this is a damn mess man
this is a damn mess
now we we're investing everything we
have in like scaling right now
if we get
down to lethal
that is where i have to pop out of the
woodwork and say you know what the time
has come
we're definitely going to be on lethal
okay now we gotta
we gotta
mix it up it's a fun game but it doesn't
do anything new
bro look at the nominees for game of the
year this people will really be like
it's fun but it's not innovative
nominated for game of the year
zelda 8 metroid 15.
the new third-person action game from
sony that's in a different uh universe
this time but stars exactly the same
people
listen i'm not trying i'm just i'm i'm
not trying to say those games shouldn't
be up there i'm just saying they need to
put some more respect on mechanics
driven games
and don't give me the the fallacious
argument
that is like oh this game doesn't do
anything new when they're nominating
sequel sequel sequel franchise reboot
sequel franchise spiritual successor
free to sequel sequel
just nominate super auto pets and i'll
shut up is that that's all i need to say
okay
if you just nominate that it doesn't
even have to be game of the year how
about debut indy there's a debut in the
category
it's like two two developers from
denmark made this game is that it it
doesn't get more debut than that they're
going up against
studios that have like 50 million
dollars in vc
funding just and again i'll stop telling
the truth i'm easy to silence if you
just put some respect on the game's name
because it deserves it
anyway
okay you have to go that's that's a
given
you have to stay
it's like go-gurt but to stay
at this point we might as well
just send
you
and then
believers do you trust me
you remember when i was like believers
you're in good hands
that was before we went seven rounds
without seeing even one more dog
please and i see no scorpion i see a
horse there might be a chance here
i think we win this
okay good stuff good stuff disco elysium
was more mechanically innovative it
didn't come out i'm the same honest i'm
not trying this what is it
do people let you get away with these
techniques when you have discussions
with them in real life
sure dune was good but is it as good as
citizen kane they're not in the same
period they're not in competition for
the same awards and there's no reason
they can't coexist
it's a disingenuous form of reasoning
voice crack
but it's a voice crack due to some form
of congestion
as a as a result that doesn't mean i
lose the argument plus i didn't say a
single word wrong if i mispronounced the
word or stuttered i would accept that i
lost the argument
but i didn't don't care didn't ask plus
i didn't stutter
super auto pets versus loop hero though
i mean we this is something that we can
just solve mathematically super auto
pets play time 96.7 hours
that's merely on the pc version
steam is like crashed
i'll tell you loop here i probably got
four and a half hours in
the steam the steam client is not
working well you look the joke makes
herself um
how are we gonna get this
sleep hero come on that's just rude
although i did think they need to make a
sleepog emote which is when somebody
talks so much that you fall asleep
and it rhymes with pepo g which is
perfect like and the way some people ask
like how would you use it in chat it's
so simple at the end of an among us game
when you fall asleep because somebody
can't handle that they lost and they say
but actually i should have won because
you were moving even if you weren't
actually an imposter you marinated me
into thinking you're an imposter by
schmoving which you never do in
electrical unless you're gonna go vent
or you're the sheriff or you're the
jester so i can't believe that i can
understand why you thought i was
marinating you but really it was your
fault that i lost that's when you sleep
og
that's when you put sleepog out there
it's like you're talking i'm writing but
you're boring me
i think sleepog could be the next it
could take the world by storm
we need
you to we need another unit that does
something
so i genuinely think
we need to just get a scorpion
and
that's the only
thing i respect right now is a scorpion
um you're not a scorpion
for the record
you're not a scorpion okay um this is
not good
we have one unit that does anything
and it's done okay um
yeah this is gonna be a loss
i i'm just being straight up with you
i do feel first off congratulations
doubters your your faith has been
rewarded or perhaps your faithlessness
uh as we run one back but also i feel
like we kind of got like
we just got stuck in the mud like we
never got
any
levels on our animals except for the
damn badger
take that
not a great early squad
i always go danish geeks man
we did we did have a 27-4 dog for a bit
you're not wrong
hey we draw these
thoughts on sacking lives for ducks i i
think it can totally work
see what this hits first
okay if it hits you then we have to do
this
straight up this is a strange situation
but i think an ant on three hp is gonna
be more valuable than getting the level
up two two then we get to save for the
next round as well i'm i'm well uh
unfortunately their cricket was buffed
so
that that did not play out the way i
thought it would
this isn't going to go how you think
so duck is still d tier no i think like
duck is
duck is probably like s tier now
this is pretty big honestly
i think you you probably take an
elephant at the back
and then use your snail
now you got a 5 6 elephant just chill in
there
disrespect but
no way it's asked here i i for real
think is asked here
i mean like look at rajat 24.
he thinks it's asked here it's round
three he's rolling three ducks
three base level ducks and you know
what's messed up i i bet he's gonna get
there
i i firmly believe that he can make it
so here's the plate this is where we
just root for miracles
we buy a dodo we pill the ant so that
it's more likely to hit the dodo
it's called skill difference
then
you sell the beaver even though it's an
87
buff the dodo
then you buy the otter and it's a 50 50
to buff the dodo
piece
okay i'm thinking
i mean as a no-brainer
something like this
dude i don't care if we get to a level
three otter and then we have a uh this
is a loss by the way but if we get to a
level three otter
and then we get a bison that's 10 wins
please don't buff my duck
thank you that's fine i'll live with
that
okay okay
sell me
buy me buff buff me buff me you son of a
okay but hold on
dodo
rooster
i'm not i'm not above becoming that
which i hate
we need to get you scaling a little
faster but
i mean i'll just be real with you it
still kind of seems like this build is
like a little ass
street meet jesus
what a name
um
okay you need this
for sure
i do want to take a swan
i'm not gonna buy the duck to enable it
though
need to figure out how we're going to
get there man i mean at this point we
could sell the otter and start buying
another one
i don't know about that though um this
is this is tough this is a tough one
let's you know what i like winning what
you don't like winning
we gotta win some rounds here
real voice stop making fun of me i got
my kid in daycare restarting the economy
single-handedly
getting roasted out here for keeping the
national gdp rising getting just
freaking bombarded every single day by a
series of nude like toddler-born germs
what the heck is debated turkey
it's an american thanksgiving emote i
think
i need you to
get
stronger
or you to get stronger i honestly think
you roll
until you okay
sorry to do this to you but
i think we can do that
hold it for a second this might be the
rare like actually functional level 2
giraffe situation
thank god we had exactly the right
amount of hp to make that work
what do we have four four
okay
you we at level eight we gotta take a
bison thank you for hanging around
giraffe but the bison must exist now
that's extremely big
and now we can actually
it's a tough call
okay you don't buy these yet even though
we'll give you a level two
because the can
is a buff in and of itself
yeah yeah yeah this would be a huge win
i don't know if it's gonna happen
aphrodite's venus
exqueeze me
all right i mean this one's a loss for
sure
but and we're not on lethal this is
beautiful this is a beautiful thing
get out of my face
can me
buy me
buy me
sell me
buy me there was another buy sitting in
there no no don't lie to me
i don't think this matters at all
you sold your level three
don't care didn't ask plus we still win
all right hold on hold on buy some blind
that's why i should never play the bison
man i don't have the i don't have the
fortitude to make it work
i don't have the demeanor required
oh
saved
[Laughter]
and now i'm like
i'm just a scumbag i mean look at this
man
this is just nasty
we win these that's that's the believer
threshold holy crap we we made it back
just just very lucky quite frankly
not sure if you noticed that we were
extremely lucky there
we do have to rework the squad
which actually probably involves
selling the bison
or selling the elephant
um
start another rooster you could probably
think about it
but
i'm uh
i'm just gonna be real with you i'm kind
of like a cupcake man here
cupcake man i'm a cupcake man
i can make a cupcake fast as you can
turkey fly no that's for people who hate
fun i love fun that's why i'm playing a
dodo level 3 rooster
a build that has a lot of variants built
in okay sell me
buy me
buy me
we do a little trolling here
buy me
until we're on lethal we don't need to
put a scorpion out there
so if we win this round we don't need
the scorpion if we lose
rooster's not gonna spawn enough
chickens man
hold on everyone chill
chill chill me we're chilling we're
chilling oh we're definitely chilling
we're definitely chilling
all the way back to tom green
oh you mean the best comedian of my of
my time on earth
you know what let's just put it like
this for now so we don't forget
i think it's too late for garlic you're
just like a scorpion eater as far as i'm
concerned
come on come on
come on you peace
juice me
okay i will sushi next time we'll get a
level 2 cat out there
i so by the way i'm oh no turkey tiger
fly
it's not turkey tiger fly though okay
hold on hold on are we we're oh oh dude
they got that they got the perfect
counter to us here
um
i'm not one of those people who's like
oh
um
the scots-tots episode of
uh
the office i can't handle that i'm not
good with cringe humor like i'm not weak
like that
um
but there is one bit like tom
uh tom green goes to
japan
i have to run this for now but you're
gonna come out next time if we're lucky
enough to win
uh and he's just filming in like front
of this temple
and then an old man falls down the
stairs in front of him and he just
laughs like points
openly at the man
and laughs at him for
at least 45 seconds and it's
that's like my limit for cringe humor
like me watching that i was like first
off
rude secondly this is like the funniest
thing i've ever seen in my life
but thirdly i was like i would not have
the stomach to do like i would have to
walk away if that happened to me in real
life i think
he also i mean there's some i think
we're kind of coming around on the
on the
uh jackass stuff as well
but uh like to the fact that it's kind
of cool again but there's one where
they're at a conveyor belt sushi or tom
green's at a conveyor belt sushi
restaurant
and he just
puts on
like a vibrating dildo onto one of the
plates on the conveyor belt and then
like they watch it go around over and
over and then the chef
like finds it and he chases him out of
the restaurant with a big knife it's
it's really good
i hate to say it but it's like really
funny
sell dodo
i would never
it's turned in our 31-31 chicks into 49
three chicks
you don't need it i'm not selling it
don't care didn't ask
sell all the animals and start over
the bootstrap build
that'd be a fun challenge if i uh cared
enough to click bait i guess
hmm
harm herm herm
herm
herm
um this is pretty bad
but
just roll a pair at dodo it should give
the dodo 25 attack i guess
i thought about the otter what that what
the heck is this one one up deer tiger
turkey fly
what the hell i'll roast you this second
position
that might actually spell the death of
me
god i hate this build man look it's okay
we're toast look i think we would have
been toasted either way i just hate this
i mean we were you know what you get
what you deserve
how many wins do we get
nine wins
eight wins
nine went nine wins
how did we get 70 points with nine wins
they don't divide evenly
anyway we won
we'll run it back obviously
i like i said i can't be mad like i ran
dodo rooster like
it's not like i was running the most
honorable like creative build of all
time
please
anything but a horse
if it's another duck i pog okay
if it's
a cricket i pog if it's a pig i accept
it
what the [ __ ]
i mean i guess you got no choice man
why not buy and then roll because i
didn't want the otter to be forced to
buff the duck but that's like
i guess it wasn't forced we could have
just rolled one duck and then saved the
otters i'll be the huge husbands
this is an abandon
if you're weak this is an abandon
yeah okay so we lose these
that's okay
look you can't be too picky here
i would definitely sell a 3-4 duck
in order to finance something better
losing the first two rounds doesn't
matter that much and you know what i'm
looking at this we may draw we may draw
this one
we did draw this one
i'm not thrilled with what they want
from me here you
i'm sorry
the ability to get a 4-4 dog out there
matters that's worth something okay
you can roll an ant out there for a
second
you gotta give it a try
you don't have to shrimp dog
dude i'm just gonna be real with you i
think the shrimp is genuine ass
i know i've been calling everything ass
lately but it's the truth okay
the canuckser ass and the witcher on
netflix is ass
i never said the queen's gambit was ass
i just said i thought it was maybe like
a little overrated
that's it there's a difference
i did not say the queen's gambler was
ass
i wouldn't i wouldn't be caught dead
saying that
six seven
on it pill me
by me
we should have done by me so it doesn't
matter too much in this case
freeze me honestly i'll freeze a badger
here why not
i'll freeze the spider in a pill like
that's i don't know what that's 17 gold
to get no value let's do it
you came into chib's chat last night and
called the ass
no i said it's [ __ ] from ass that's
that's different
we win these
i didn't call it ass i called it [ __ ]
i wouldn't expect you to understand
okay we have to do it like this to get
the buff i'll take it dude i don't know
i think you can freeze a bison for
prospects in the future
we might get to a level three it
wouldn't be
that surprising
you can actually roll a kangaroo even
though it's one stat lower than you'd
normally like to see and then that's all
we wanted to see was garlic and now that
we see garlic this ain't so bad man
this seems fine
okay we will
sell the otter
thanks but no thanks we'll buy a swan
we'll roll
we'll roll
you know we can
buy
and then combine
you're you're not wrong by the way
we do have a great track record
when we pill a swan
it's it should be like a stats 101
lesson right
like hey on runs where he pills a swan
he he has a 100 10 win rate
this is a great time to have some garlic
i respect this build but i don't think
it's going to get you there quite yet
thank you by the way to whoever's going
off in chat about the squid game being
overrated not because i agree with you
but because it's gonna take a lot of the
heat off me for not enjoying the queen's
gambit i i respect and appreciate that
one of my i didn't even do anything i
didn't do anything this whole turn
all i did was roll
your take saved me
this is not good
paid chat or paid chatter
well i think like here's the thing i
think squid game is good
i'm just like very um cynical about the
concept of a second season
we need an animal
i want to buy an animal
like i get that it ended with a like a a
pseudo kind of cliffhanger
but like i felt like it was a
cliffhanger that wasn't really asked for
not asked for
like they could have just had it come to
like a reasonable conclusion but instead
they were like hey you know
we're gonna lose this one too
should not have combined you're right
you're right
that being said like again i also i
believe in the principle
of
if the show
is good
let them screw up
we're gonna try it we're gonna try it
like i think they've earned a chance
even though this has nothing to scale
with yet i'm still rolling um i think
they've earned a chance to to try
for season two
give him a chance
oh you son of a
hold on we make it we make it
we don't make it we don't make it
all right so that's going to be a
doubter payout i was a hey look i got a
little on focus there
what can i say
we're running it back again triple
beavers
why not
double fish
a frigid masseuse that's a scary thought
right
we lose round one i can live with that
have you seen the second hunger games i
imagine it'll be that don't put me in
that in that quagmire
lois
as the as a noted hunger games catching
fire defender i don't know what to think
when you when you tell me that it's
gonna be catching fire
what the heck juice me squeeze me kill
me
we lose this by the way but whatever
it's round one who cares
who cares but yeah my corsi is off the
[ __ ] charts right now
i wouldn't expect you to understand
combine me
you can you can roll a giraffe early
especially if we get like some garlic or
something
um so let's buy the giraffe if we're
gonna roll it
let's buy an otter i don't really care
that was like the one thing you couldn't
hit you piece
you can totally roll a kangaroo
and then
i think you're gonna do it like
like this
what's coursey it's like when your
favorite hockey player sucks
all you have to do to win an online
argument is be like nah dude they don't
suck like i know they look like complete
garbage every time they've touched the
puck but look at this stat that
uh
is like ever how many times when they
touch the puck does the puck move more
forward then it moves more backwards and
it's like
you know then you're like oh he has one
of the top 30 courses in the league
actually
i need to figure out what i'm doing
especially once we roll past the dog
that's where things get a little
a little spicy
they're very nice you know what i'm i'm
i'm buying things that are good
for leveling up fast to try to get to a
bison this is i'm gonna cure my bison
uh blindness this time you peace
dude without insanely good luck for us
there
i like this i don't mind this in the
slightest hit me
very good
why don't you just
why don't you just stab me
we're almost at a level three
that garlic is gonna be insanely if dude
if we get a bison this could roll
what the heck this seems fun
germa viewer germa viewers spotted
not because they did badly but because
they ran a cool hedgehog
okay okay we got a level three fish
this is great news
now we can roll bison i gotta i gotta
slow down the apm i gotta roll bison
just look for bisons
like this is now an autopilot run we can
actually sell the beaver if we like as
well
we don't have to do it for those
nor these although a deer is always a
little tempting you could def okay your
time has come
goodbye
beaver
hello monkey
freeze
me i'm just i'm so paranoid you know
what i'm optimistic i'm bullish on my
bison chances next round
i just look over your chat and i'm just
begging
to not see anything that says bison
bison mr bison i think we're doing okay
for now what the heck did you do to your
crab man
it's a 13-4 that's not gonna get you
there
doubters honestly like ripped to you
you had you had some good wins earlier
today
you got some serious issues now though
pill the otter
he's just chilling i'm he's i got no
quarrel with the otter
horse dude
what are you thinking
just an honest simple question
horse like
really
hold on hold on we draw these
[Laughter]
bison bison i saw it i saw it
how do you like them apples i got her
number
okay now this this is still working
really well for now but soon the bison
will outscale the fish which is good
news for us
um
absolutely no no corals putting one of
those up there we can freeze this and i
think we can freeze this
i do love a scorpion i have faith that
we will get one in the future
we're not selling the fish
the fish is going is not going bye-bye
if we ten win this which i actually
think is fairly likely we gotta put a
lot of respect on on the giraffe's name
not typically the the tier three you're
looking for but has done some awesome
work for us
penguin penguin's not there penguin's
not it
i love an autopilot run man like look at
this we're just we're just buying foods
okay now you're starting to get a little
scary
oops
oops we win
look at it it's like you know on the
like last episode of survivor when they
walk by the corpses of everybody they
voted off the island like that's what
it's like playing super auto pets for me
is just constantly like reminiscing over
all the builds that i popularized and
then just mercilessly trouncing them on
route to 10 easy wins
they stopped doing that like 20 seasons
ago
oh he doesn't know
[Laughter]
he doesn't know
they're bringing it back i don't know i
don't know that here's the thing the
tiger it doesn't really work with
anything here i wish it did i mean you
could roll it with the kangaroo but i
sleep i sleep i'm a happy man right now
i'm i'm very content where we stand
like this is a it's a dang good squad
man
we got we got no concerns whatsoever
look at this hey steve 5693 thank you
for the gifted subscriptions as well
one for each win we're liable to get i
mean we're at well actually one for each
half of a win that we're liable to get
that's even better even more bullish on
our wins we can freeze the scorpion now
even though it makes our shop worse
my personnel opinion
is that
if you get to lethal you sell your
giraffe and or your monkey and you roll
one to two scorpions
okay finally now now we've got a real
threat
they're they're rolling a sniper build
they are going to own me
i give respect to tan tindy tin deals
build here i love a snipe build even
when it beats me
blessed are the forgetful for they get
the better even of their dang blunders
you know
honestly i'm gonna say monkey is going
bye-bye for a bit here
it's a tough decision i i take no
pleasure in it um
we're gonna stick to scaling the unit
most likely
to benefit our our kangaroo
remember what i said about double
scorpions
remember how you said no don't do it
i never had a choice
you're getting this next time for sure
for sure
aha you don't do it you're so scaly
you son of a whoa
i like this leopard snipe build it's
just a shame you had to taint it with
your your dodo build as well
okay now we're on lethal
this is necessary
yeah we do need we need some melon armor
we didn't get any melon armor
you never know
maybe that maybe this six hp will be uh
will be relevant
uh we could have sold your app and
rolled two scorpions that would probably
be better but
what can i say i was pogging this looks
like a more traditional build i don't
sweat this
i'm sweating it we lose
all right well but dude you know what we
did it i can't help but feel like two
scorpios would have done better for us
there
but we did get to six wins or more fell
off kind of fast but



you know how it is we're in the groove
right now
do i have you know is my bladder filling
up to the point where like my eyeballs
are starting to feel a little mushy yeah
but then we go back to expansion pack
one
and we play a little of that we start a
prediction
i love this shop
so let me talk to my shop
you guys like lil wayne
as music
specifically
how about the fatherly pencils
real talk though you think he did that
[ __ ]
we lost to a horse don't don't talk to
me okay
that's it's i'm a psycho now
in 2006 maybe oh come on you weren't
even people who loved lil wayne in 2006
because they were big into you know like
the carter vol 2.
you were pogging when lollipop went to
number one you're like finally after
like six or seven years of being the
best unknown rapper in the world
uh
he's he's getting the credit that he
deserves don't act like you weren't
happy for lil wayne when lollipop popped
it's only after that when he you know he
lost his way
sure you know what like this is this is
full food marty
what the what the heck
what the heck
four seven rat
is this allowed
mona lisa is one of the best rap songs
period
the one by andy sandberg mona lisa you
an ugly piece of [ __ ] that one
i bumped that in my gray chevy cavalier
with the shitty base in the back i'm
kind of like losing it the way people
are reminiscing over lollipop which is a
song that for me basically came out like
a year and a half ago
dude we gotta go puppy
i hate to say it you gotta sell fish and
go puppy
that way you get the puppy scaling
you're rather selling fish or you're
selling your ultimate food enabler here
the puppy is like you gotta take it
that being said we do appear to be like
losing a lot
that was 13 years ago what
i was listening to a podcast and they
were like
you know i started investing during the
global financial crisis
13 years ago and i was like you're bad
at math buddy that was like five years
ago
then i did the math and i was like holy
bursh
yummy
like i i'm just kind of stunned like
to me it doesn't make sense that this
song this song this run could be losing
like look at this 710
ladybug
like how do we lose with a 710 ladybug
it doesn't make sense
we're on lethal man
you're right we just got a channel
island boy
thank you thank you
am i crazy or did three things eat based
on the
no you know why three things ate because
you eat no matter what when when
something else eats you eat
there's no negotiation required
we we forego one round of puppy scaling
in order to get a hatching chick out
there
we do not forgo one round
this will make or break us right here
i'm feeling
um
anybody else feeling like they've been
break
[Laughter]
okay pay out the doubters on that one
we'll run that one back
that was a one win marty okay pay to win
you know it's a cool mistress well your
14 19 beetle can't get you there like
that's a that's just a nasty time
forget food build i will never roll food
build again we kind of got a food build
set up here though flexible cucumbers
that's perfect
one win are we watching mouth excuse me
did you not see malf on twitter
yesterday
he's been getting lots of wins source
dude just trust him
i'm gonna i'm gonna go hard here we
already got one win
let's get a nice fish buff here
source twitter dot com slash michaela
fox
thank you for using proper mla sourcing
send me
send me
you know what sure
tropical fish me
i'm gonna roll a four squad marty here
because i want to minimize no i'm not
you're a piece just don't hit my bird
it's that easy
okay so this squad is gonna be pretty
bad at the front
but the back is a is a
a freaking
it's a death sentence back there
mortis lourdes
all right well
they got a strong beetle as well
what are we at here eight lives i'm not
dude i'm zero percent sweating
do you have to roll a dog
yes
so feed me
buy me
you get a nice two hp buff already
sell
me buy me
sell me
buy me
you you know what you're going to be a
long-term scaler for us more so than a
fish so let's get it set up like this
like like this
3-6 dog
some people take dark matter a little
too far in my opinion
but what do i know
you know i think we can
you don't want to say goodbye to a fish
i don't want to say goodbye to anything
so see you later bat
you stink
this is a bit weird okay but like look
at how much our stats improve just from
this one little interaction that we had
right here
sloth
drake
okay we win these
i do not feel like we can run
the caterpillar i don't think we can run
the caterpillar i can't believe by the
way i've never seen a sloth like do i
have to do something to unlock a sloth
no it's just insanely rare
dude i play for like
like so many hours like i feel like i my
head should be exploding i haven't seen
one yet
you got to be cool oh well that's my
problem then
this looks kind of bad but i feel like
our garlic armor just blows out sheep so
badly we actually have nothing to worry
about
one of these days that's gonna be it's
gonna be worth it okay
copium now i don't know why we're still
buying fish i guess maybe we're hoping
perhaps
a bison could exist in the future
can we get in this the sloth clip dude
if we get a sloth i'll be thrilled
look at this
holy crap we win that
it's raining hp here hello victor hello
we're running some goofy builds here but
the believers are i mean they haven't
been eating good historically but
they're kind of like eating good right
now
dude i'm one of these days we're gonna
lose around i know it seems impossible
to imagine right
now but it will happen
we're so close to a bison like two
different ways
three different ways almost
this still seems okay to me
cytotoxic thunder
oh jeez said easy there
look at there's no sweat man
one of these days those snails are gonna
work
is this allowed a second dog i didn't
know i thought that that was like a one
of one
super rare
honestly i'm just gonna keep you scaling
man the dog's got his own scaling engine
also you see in these snails holy birch
um
is this allowed
i would love here's here you ready for
this
we deliberately lose this round we buy
chocolate for the dog freeze the cow
lose
next turn
snail snail count we win
get out of my face you suck you stink
i love it
four squad marty guaranteed loss here
i am going to blow up the moon great
name
not a noble effort though we're gonna
win this dude i'm actually kind of
pissed off
like my whole my dream victory is
falling apart just because nobody can
defeat me
super mancy hello did you know by the
way that according to nightbot you are
the most prolific chatter
in this chat
every time i go to nightbot it says top
chatter supramancy omg heart i thought
you might be interested to know that
it's a stat that i don't know if
everybody's able to see
i'm just rolling i'm not even paying
attention man what am i
the heck am i doing i know what the heck
i'm doing
i do it i i genuinely like want to lose
you re-roll past the level 3 beetle
that's all right i would rather have a
level two and a half fish anyway
i want to lose please please
lose me lose me
it's finally happened
it's it's the the dream again
okay you need
this
buy me
sell me
buy me
sell me
miami hello
selmy
stay
stay
i think we got to put this fish a little
further back too
oh your hair looks really nice
oh no
she got so dazzled by her husband's
charm she she bumped her shoulder
yeah it looks really nice
you okay
she's got ruptured deltoid i could tell
she's got all the symptoms
she's rubbing her shoulder
that's a big one
three week recovery lowered by
unspecified lower body injury probably
out for three to six weeks
bison it's so late for me to be a bison
boy
[Laughter]
you like that
i'm a bison boy i like to roll my dog
she's she's laughing she loves it
all right
four squad marty
okay sure
i love a snipe build man i will never
cast disrespect on a snipe build
i will tell you though i feel like
kangaroo with a tiger behind it might
beat me there
oops we're pogging
honestly you can now be sold so there is
a piece of me that's like
what have you bought this
and then just started fishing for level
ones
it's rare to see a late game pivot to a
buy me sell me build but i think that
you know
that's what has to be done
man i would love to sneak in a hedgehog
whale build i don't even say the words
right
hedgehog whale build there we go
all right we lose this
sell me
buy me
yeah we nee we need to get our
our damage up there no no question about
that you know what we can keep one of
you frozen there's no way i'm rolling a
6-6 bison boy here you got to be joking
me
hedgehog is anti-rooster tech you know
what nothing would please me more than
seeing a hedgehog move uh
higher up in the meta
i'm i'm like stunned at a melon armor 10
10 deer
oh my god level three freaking rooster
every freaking time man
all right well we still get eight wins
we pay out the believers
it's okay it was a fun run
give me a uh give me um give me a play
free to play dude i i really want to do
wait this is not free to play
i refuse to abandon
but i wanna i wanna get a hedgehog build
going though
okay this is big buy big buy
i love just rolling a completely uniform
squad even if it's not the meta
i'll be the boring nuts
can you imagine having an unremarkable
nut sack couldn't be me testicular
surgery at the age of 16.
while we win these that's a surprise
dude this is a nasty squad though look
at this
absolutely
okay you know what in that case we're
gonna do the full combine
i didn't mean to combine them i meant
the first time i meant to place them in
such a way
that um that the one with more hp would
be at the front but whatever
whatever man it doesn't matter
too much maybe
we should have bought some food um
okay hold on redemption
yeah
okay
okay okay
okay
throwing for content i don't have my
head in the game yet
what what are you doing like honest this
is just like disrespectful stream
sniping
what is this
your team's looking like tony's man
you would have been better off not even
buying pets
give me one of these we have to be
careful with with who we apply with whom
we apply the food to we could do it like
this i suppose
believer spotted
yo i love that love me some double bat
when they both hit where they're
supposed to hit
nice horse by the way nice horse
it's round five
send me
if you can't beat them eat them
sure sure sure
you know what no no
because here's the thing man you can
i actually like keeping the rooster in
the shop
because it's easier to buff one rooster
with some damn cans
and
even just by feeding this guy
now all of a sudden
you know the roosters taking a little
extra buff advantage without even being
on this on the damn squad
this looks like a nightmare though
this looks pretty bad
it's not like a rooster would have saved
us
copium
sorry we have six hp
i mean i'll be the first to tell you
this squad is not that impressive right
now
that's why i'm rolling deep i'm doing a
deep roll here to try to get to some
garlic armor i know this guy is meat
you're gonna doubt this option i'm
telling you it's the right play whether
you believe it or not
huge potential i'm freezing the whole
damn shop i'm putting the system on
trial
what was your favorite meme video
from old youtube circa 2012 or
2008-2009
um
there's a video from like 2005 it's
literally nine seconds long
uh and it's just like like a a nerdy kid
in the forest he's like he's maybe 20.
okay so maybe he's not a kid
uh
like an adobe after effects
horrible looking ufo
descends into the frame and then he
turns around and pulls out a gun and
says not today [ __ ] and just
starts shooting the
spaceship with a gun and then it
explodes
hold on hold on
hold on
okay
hold on hold on
not today
just give it a second
a ufo tried to kill me oh this is it
uh you from 2006
a ufo tried to kill me so i shot it
[Applause]
[Laughter]
[Applause]
hello daniel by the way hello we'd love
to see it i bet you would
i bet you would
all right let's see how we gonna do this
that seems good
okay now we're freaking talking man now
we're freaking talking
i love omg it's spider-man
dude it's like kind of crazy right like
i'm nobody knew what i was talking about
when i said that in spider-man 3 there's
a moment where freaking
spider-man swings in the frame and a
lady goes oh my god it's spider-man
and like
when i saw it in theaters me and my
friend turned to each other and were
like what the hell are they what's going
on
[Laughter]
why is this so bad
i'm go go it's in the movie you'll find
it on the
on on the youtubes as they say
roll me
delightful
anybody else delightfully or just me
okay
that's yeah sam raimi loves having
ladies scream into the camera that's
that's definitely true by the way
anybody losing right now or just me
i still don't buy the argument though
that like
sam raimi deliberately made
spider-man 3 bad because like that's
just like his style man that's just his
style is just making bad movies no it's
not
you peace
his his style is is camp
it's not making bad movies
dude this squad will pop
if we just if we just get through this
round
sam raimi's got some amazing movies evil
dead one evil dead two spider-man one
spider-man two
drag me to hell liam neeson's dark man
like these are all some some genuine
classic like campy movies that i have a
lot of affinity for he he just [ __ ] up
spider-man 3 okay
in my opinion at least i claudius
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
by the way thank you
thank you
you skipped army of darkness i know what
i did
look i got nothing against army of
darkness i just think it's not as good
as evil dead one or evil dead too
i think it's fine
but i think
it's almost it's like a little bit too
self-aware for me maybe that's what i'll
say it's a little too self-aware
please
please
that's big
we win these for the believers okay okay
why not buff rooster i honestly think
with garlic the 5 hp on a garlic unit it
can be any unit but the 5 hp on the
garlic unit matters more than the 5
attack on a rooster personally
and by personally i actually mean like
mathematically
please okay i can live with this
i can live with this
now
we
reorganize slightly slightly
let's go dude overriding that meat
is extremely helpful
thank you thank you
no no don't show me let's go we're
living
owned
okay this is necessary so we're
overriding like more than half of the
equipment that's wonderful news
um
wouldn't mind some
some melon armor
you need one of these let's be real
you can start to think about something
like that
okay
this is still like jesus take the wheel
territory but that's okay
please
okay i'll accept it
there's no way we're winning this one
right yeah
still
that's seven wins okay now now i'm not
promising a hedgehog build okay
but
i'm not saying we're not gonna do a
hedgehog build
which means you're gonna put me over
here
thank you
and we're gonna run it back
you know what
i'll be the silly soup
three horses this is my new my new strat
three horses okay so far so good three
horses
definitely hey like it looked bad to
start with
no denying that but now that we got a
cricket how could things possibly go
wrong
i know how this looks but trust me
god i was settled for a for a damn draw
hold on hold on no we lose okay see
again i'm just i'm just telling you like
this is my proof of concept that horses
are are legitimately not playable
like we kind of got the dream team for
horses and it's still not functional how
do you have three one one horses well
they start as one one so
i guess the answer is that i bought them
so you're saying there's a chance
[Laughter]
not that i'm defending a horse but this
is a [ __ ] team this is literally like
the dream horse team
which is again just another example of
why this [ __ ] is unplayable
it's all things that spawn things it's
like that this is this is what horse
builds want
now if we're gonna get out of this what
if you tried
a little horse
dog now pivot please no we're this is
this is us now this is like that show
this is us this is us man
i need so many pills please please me
5-1 flamingo
the game gave me three horses at the
front that's all i'm saying it said do
you want to go horses yes or no check
yes or no by george strait i checked yes
and here we go
holy crap it's actually matching
perfectly
we can't be stopped
we got pills what the heck we got pills
i mean the horse is not going anywhere
it's the greatest unit in the game so
there you go why don't you take one of
those
you should take one of these don't hit
the spider let's go
dreams can come true
temporary swan please
it is kind of funny to think about
rolling a hedgehog here but i don't i
don't think it could work i don't think
it could work here i don't think it
could work here
toss me one of those instead
hog me
look we can't roll two meme builds at
the same time
a meme divided cannot stand nor can a
george divided thanks for the snail
always appreciate a little snail action
we draw these
you need to get pilled man
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah okay hold on one of
these
no not today you peace
thanks for the sell
roll me here
you know what if we're going full memes
then we're going full memes
sell me
by me
my god it's something's happening here
it's a good day to be a doubter can i
tell you i'm not sure that it is
they got that we're going up against
people who got an ox at the front man ox
at the front
i'm not rolling a rooster what do you
think i have like a horse or something
obviously you're sticking around so like
we do this
we do this
we would easily sell your ass
i snooze i snooze these
what that's a terrible sound man
what was that sound
it did it sounded like a fart
i don't care if we lose go ahead
i was born in the loss molded by it
dude honestly this is why horse sucks
and i recognize that i'm rolling it
like
your whole squad
basically loses
to what
like to one garlic armor
we still draw so i mean i guess it draws
to garlic armor but still
shows what i know okay one of these
please thank you
i think we got a role like meme stress
man we gotta do like do this buy me
sell me
buy me
sell me
and just badger me like right here
something like that dude it honestly it
it seems to be worth it look at this
incredible horse build we got here
hey hey that's not fair you can't
criticize the horse build
until you at least give it an honest
shake by also building your whole squad
around it with sheeps and whales
him me
what would we like to roll last here
none of these so roll me once we would
like to roll a dolphin last wonderful so
buy me
sell me
buy me
sell me
buy me
sell me
buy me
roll me
now that is interesting
now that is interesting
what a delightful little situation
that has become apparent to us
hold on any anybody living in chat yep
us
why would eat turkey you don't summon
anything you mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger
thank you
i thank you
okay
okay
for now
this is a simple four now
get ready you're all about to be ashamed
of your words and your deeds
double scorpion
maybe not this round maybe not this
round
no shot no shot
here we go oh one single fly
and you're and you're ashamed of your
words and your deeds i don't know what
you want me to say
it's well known at this point what's
gonna happen
dragon
you peace
i need summons man i need summons
that's a summon hey hey hey hey
that's a summon
it's not a good one yet
okay honestly
give me a little uh shrimp at the front
for scorpion technology
that's a summon
anti-scorpion technology incoming
okay this also seems pretty bad
or does it
yeah yeah it does but maybe not as bad
as it originally looked like
maybe
okay you're sold
you're both
and i know the dog at the front seems
kind of weird here but it's a necessity
um
um um sorry
goodbye horse is i'm crying over you
this is where we get there this is how
we get two more wins for the believers
run into you
please please please me please we gotta
break that armor you gotta break that
armor man
okay this seems like a doubter payout
that's fine though that's what we get
i really think we gave it an honest try
with three horses okay but for now i'm
just gonna go to the bathroom slash
market sap uh number



hey we're back playing super auto pets
inspired inspired by the tournament
yesterday let's take a little sip of the
copium
and we're good to go i'm on pay to win
because i was inspired by
yeti's pay to win uh victory yesterday
in the tournament
i wanna i wanna see a bluebird that
buffs a rooster and i wanna win ten
here's look i'm not gonna promise
anything to you right off the bat
but here's the thing my mockery has
previously been uh equally distributed
between turkey tiger and fly
now oh let me get the casino going sorry
it's been a couple days since the casino
but um
now
all of my derision all of my oh you hate
fun you just love winning um
is uh is reserved for
dodo rooster that's it
i'm not trying to say you can't run it
just admit that you're evil
if you run it
like the
dodo rooster is just some it's just
perpetually the only thing you see past
like round 10 or 11 so get ready okay
it's just boring
like get some new material that's all
i'm saying okay that's all i'm saying
i'm not trying to cause any problems
this is a wonderful shot but i'm gonna
freeze it here
um let's see
i mean adorable
organisms is pretty good
it's a pretty good name
junior pup
junior pup
we draw these i'm not sweating it
we do have a bluebird we we have a a
completely garbage shop
so i feel like i actually would not mind
tossing a little bluebird into the
ecosystem here but this is mostly for
exploratory purposes
i think
that what i'm gonna do here is uh
i'm going to be you
and then now we got a 2-2 coming out
here i think we probably lose this round
but a 4-3 green ladybug becomes a little
spicier later and maybe you don't lose
this round because you're going up
against ducks anyway
which i i mean no disrespect
maybe we win this round because people
are so in deduct meta which is a fair
trade if you lose like i don't mind uh
going up against ducks but i also don't
mind playing ducks and then losing like
even when you lose with ducks you're
kind of winning right
sure i think uh it's tough it's a tough
tough tough tough tough
tough you kind of have to go dog for a
scaling engine i hate to say it but it's
your only option
so i'm going to actually sell my
my ladybug
buy a dog
i'm gonna get a little hot here okay i'm
gonna sell the ants
the jedi would not normally teach you
about this trick but i i'm gonna really
give an honest effort to the double
scalers here we're gonna actually give
the scaling to the dog
as you might expect but then i think
temporarily we're gonna uh you know buy
some extra
juice for our green ladybug and then
we're gonna roll a cool little spider up
at the front which we should move one
back in case it spawns a ram but please
note it will never spawn a ram it will
always spawn either a giraffe a useless
tutu kangaroo or a snail so prepare
yourself
okay it's not what i predicted at the
same time it is uh still useless so we
lose these that's a nasty loss i'll
admit
it's a nasty loss
maybe we don't need two birds forever
why don't you make me one two one three
three bird how about that
get a caterpillar
it's very hard to not run caterpillar
dog
there's a lot of engine gas there the
real problem is that this dog is a
freaking
7-2 that's so
okay hold on start here so buy me
thank you sell me
buy me
roll me
honestly
i'm gonna take one more
i i love this i'm gonna freeze the whole
shop you're gonna laugh at me but i'm
gonna freeze the whole shop um i'm gonna
take one more loss like straight on the
chin
and then we start our game plan then we
start the game plan
what's with the eight hearts who's gonna
tell him
we definitely lose this by the way like
it's not even close
we knew that was gonna happen i was kind
of hoping at some point we would get
some hp on our dog but that's my mistake
what was i thinking the reason i like
this though is because now you can do a
pill
we got an owl that's an incredible boost
man
that's not bad i'll take it i'm not
upset with that
one gold for a little extra stat on her
dog nothing wrong with that
why does he break into the song love me
love me when he plays this um because
i'm saying like juice me juice me say
that you'll juice me
the birds gotta go
is i didn't know we were gonna be
rolling it to the four squad marty
oh no um okay that's that's why uh god
gave you so much hp
you can laugh all you want we're making
it out of this in many ways
i don't care about anything but juice
two giraffes
what the heck
is this allowed
um we definitely draw this which is
actually like a dream
why didn't you just leave the bat
separate yeah i mean obviously in
hindsight why didn't you just buy apple
stock when you were fresh out the damn
womb
bonus points will go to answers that
don't say the sac the sec won't let me
okay
we have to
take the buffalo
i mean the bison i mean the buffalo
we have to we should have done it
earlier probably
um
i think you've gotta just accept we
might take a loss in the process here
but it's worth it
in order to have a chance to scale
better for the future
yeah i can live with this
one garlic we're back in this one garlic
i feel like we're going up against the
one one worm that's and hey that one one
worm look at that also has a little bit
of
uh weakness on it that's pretty positive
in many ways i think i think we can pull
ourselves back here
poodle
we have a four a two a three a three a
two it's a hard way to make a poodle fit
i think we can out scale a poodle
honestly
i think we can do better so hatching
chick this is why we keep one frozen so
we can do something like this then we
get some nice buffs
we go up a level
not functional at all
uh for us right now but one day perhaps
yeah i mean they didn't even have meat
on their crab what were they thinking
crabless meat i don't think so
can is always pretty tempting at some
point we're gonna need a turtle for sure
pepe
okay
give me one of these
sell it
freeze the bison for now
roll the hatching chick in front of the
dog for some you know what i actually
like this more now because of the way
the hp shook out there
keep the buffalo frozen
the buffalo's scaling pretty well man
oh we didn't override the freaking dog
okay overriding the camel is quite
helpful though oh this dog is gonna get
that kangaroo going to the freaking moon
we're toast we're toast on this one all
right we're we're right on the the cusp
this is a spicy moment okay this is
necessary
this is very important
now let me think about this for a second
we'll go down to two gold
if we do this in pill i say no to that
i
do this
can't help but feel like maybe i would
have rather had a hatching chick or
something but uh here we are i i suppose
please no
please no
this looks this looks okay
we can make it
three wins okay sorry we got a little
phlegm in the throat
just need two wins in a row
three wins in a row you stay and we're
in perfect like buy a cell meta
buy me
combine me um
a skunk
welcome to the life of daycare i
appreciate it i appreciate it
it's annoying but it's it's the cost of
doing business
i don't i pill mammoth you know what you
know what you're right this this is a
great pill mammoth situation normally i
frown upon it
i'll take a plus two plus two buff on on
almost everything here
what we're really looking for like this
is not a goat build just because we
can't really afford to lose anything yet
what we want to see is a turtle
without a turtle
um
you know i'll toss a skunk in instead of
an owl just to see and we really need
garlic on the dog we probably need melon
on the dog more than anything but
or melon on the bison level one rooster
um i feel like this whale is no okay it
still spits out a pretty nasty rooster
and it spits out two sixes this is not
that bad i love beating the rooster
build man
like it just feels great to ruin
someone's day
and if you know if that's not okay to
admit in today's modern era then like i
apologize or whatever but i'm genuinely
not sorry
give me um
buy a puppy
sell a puppy
buy a dromedary like even more so than
turkey tiger fly now i feel like ruining
somebody's day when they're trying to
roll a rooster just feels incredible
this this could be a loss except i think
our bat might have just kept us in it
let's go
our bat has kept us in it that was a
pretty satisfying win too imo
now
we'll sell you
by you
the game is so sickeningly fast
[Laughter]
it is it's it's moving pretty quick okay
it's coming pretty quick
um
you can definitely fit scorpions in we
i don't think we need more than one but
a cow is just a beautiful thing
we'll make sure honestly we should apply
that to our
bison our buffalo i should say just so
that uh
the caterpillar gets the buff even
though the dog also needs it
i think you might just do something like
this i think you might do like a quick
like eight and five or like magic
numbers here to make sure you can fit in
some buy sells i don't mind this at all
now we're gonna really like our end game
avengers end game is that uh
this looks pretty good to me honestly
we're gonna be looking for uh
a turtle
level one turtle would do just fine
believers we made it i told you you're
in good hands
by the way did you see that jane campion
the director of 1993's movie the piano
starring rogue from x-men
said no i would never direct a scorpion
or a squirrel i would never direct the
superhero movie
i absolutely hate them hey any askers
any askers in chat right now any askers
don't care didn't uh
you're plus you're you directed the
piano don't care didn't ask plus you
directed the piano
hula hoop hooligan
thank you by the way thank you for the
gifted subscriptions thank you thank you
now you're getting close to max so i'm
just gonna i'm gonna buff the dog
temporarily she's an amazing filmmaker
yeah no that's fine i just mean like
literally who's gonna ask jane campion
to direct like ant-man three like come
on
that's like asking me if i'm gonna be
front row of the new sarah mclaughlin
concert like the answer is yes but it's
self-evident why even bother asking
okay
we can i think we can try
to go up to a level two dog
a leopard doesn't really fit right now
but there's some temptation hey steve
5693
thank you as well thank you
copium even if marvel came and asked me
to direct the movie i wouldn't do it
copium copium
okay now we're still looking for a
turtle
i still like this we're still looking
for a turtle
that's the only thing that matters
level one rooster uh a rooster dodo you
love to see it
rooster dodo hey have you seen this have
you seen i have lopking get the [ __ ] out
of arena
you got the audacity to run dodo rooster
at least beat me okay
because if you come
incorrect with that [ __ ] on round 12
and you lose to me
i'm gonna become more powerful than you
could ever imagine
all right buffalo i'm realizing has no
purpose
you're flat
you got no talon
we're gonna sell you we're gonna buy
we're going to buff the dog a turtle is
is huge here
we don't need the next level dog
can i tell you i almost like a sauropod
but more is like a you gotta keep it
in the slot and then buy foods but
i'm not saying it can't work i actually
totally think it could work
but more than anything else even i mean
hold on this would be this would take us
to s
six
freeze this as a just in case me
i just the the turtle matters more than
anything else
i think i think we gotta send it like
this for now
the turtle is just so clutch man
this looks a level two rooster with no
dodo behind it what the heck is this
allowed
i feel like we are again totally fine
this might have ten win potential
yo did you see that yeti released the
tier list
and then he put the eagle in the a tier
like that's that's new technology man
i don't know what to say about that i
mean he won the tournament and had some
like giga brain plays i'm just saying
i'm just a little surprised
eagle eagle is like it doesn't even
exist for me
way too late for a bison this is pretty
sick though this is pretty sick though
it's pretty sick though freeze a bat
roll once
i was really hoping for a scorpion but
i'll take
uh some extra weakness there is a
problem though because the uh the bat
could hit something else like
four melons what that please three
things got weak that's all i could ask
for
holy crap though
no no no two 250 roosters is gonna get
you there you go that if you're gonna
roll dodo rooster at least win otherwise
it's like you sold your soul for like
bit connect it's it's worth nothing
okay that's good stuff
eight wins when we were at like two wins
on lethal so i got no problem there
level two dodo level two rooster melon
armor look okay you're you're the
harkenings congratulations some of us
like to have fun
what do i know dude i don't know maybe
hold on maybe maybe maybe maybe you
could roll an early blue bird here
i'll pay out the bets pay off the bets
my mistake i'm not used to running the
casino man
and then run it back
so a lot of this like i want to get to
10 wins right but like another part of
me is just like let's just learn what
the how good the bluebird actually is
i'll be the creamy kilts
how would you nerf rooster i don't know
because like i'm not a game designer so
like at the end of the day anything that
i would say is mostly just like
congestion
congesture
it made uh what it would a freudian slip
this seems amazing
am i wrong
move please
don't move i know what you're thinking
don't tell me because it hurts
very good joke intentional or otherwise
yeah it's it dude you know what it
really is like the rooster is great
don't get me wrong
but the dodo is actually like
unstoppable
even when it's nerfed like the rumors of
its demise are greatly exaggerated
missing out on a tier two
one moment please
what is this name
milk piss lies dust
i wouldn't expect you to understand but
sometimes you sacrifice the uh
small percentage chance of getting a win
on an even numbered round in order to
maximize your chances of vaulting ahead
with a scaling factor like you're you're
out here you're looking at a graph
you're like look at this shitty line
look at this shitty line it's
y-intercept is like negative three
uh yeah okay but it's slope is like
[ __ ] a billion so look at at x equals
zero you're ahead congratulations i'm
eating your dust at x equals one you
can't even see me anymore because i'm
out of the lithosphere okay
this is where
the m
goes to the moon
we got our first level two it gave us a
caterpillar we respect it
we got our second level two
we could actually run that
you know what the fish is fun we could
take it next round though
let's roll this for a round
i'm gonna i you have my word for the
time being i'm gonna roll batliss
we're gonna do a 90 batlist run
ludwig loves the fish i know and
honestly i i'm willing to admit i think
i went into the tournament yesterday
with a little bit of ego
and i thought nobody could teach me
anything about this game that i don't
already know
and i saw some plays
made me feel ashamed of my words and my
deeds i saw some plays
that genuinely made me feel otherwise
i was i was going hard i was going hard
trying to get some garlic there
instead we're gonna roll something like
like this like this like this like this
like this
germa played level three
tiger hedgehog yesterday honestly that's
like such incredible character
development so early in his arc
i mean that's that's amazing
nothing but it took me like weeks to get
there
they had one ups too that's crazy oh
dude yeah early parrot turkey like that
was doing some work i i learned a lot
yesterday i learned a lot
okay we really need garlic
like this is not funny anymore
what is kind of funny is that like
actually our caterpillar is gonna be
popping
next turn already
okay thanks for the rat i really
appreciate it
hold on do we own you
what the okay we lose that's fine
i think the tropical fish can now go
although well it depends if we level it
okay
losing the rat hurts but the rat i don't
know it's having a bit of a renaissance
honestly
uh you can now i even think you might
exist to the front we can find another
way to buff you
and then we can put the swan at the back
and not sweat it
i don't mind throwing a second
swan into the ecosystem
we want to see a turtle it doesn't have
to happen right now
you can play a flamingo like i don't
think there's anything wrong with
playing like a one flamingo that's
that's pretty big
that's freaking huge okay
yeah i don't i don't dislike this i
think this can do something
we we still have six lives two wins chat
i'm just gonna be real with you
like
i think you're gonna be fine if you're a
believer
even a 13-8 horse can't do anything
it has no shot no shot
nl have you been to canucks games
recently i'm a fan and i'm wondering if
it's worth it
so here's my take okay i we we go to see
canucks games
maybe like once every six weeks or
something like that
i'll be straight up with you i'll be
real with you
right we should have moved the swan up
the team is dog [ __ ] right now like
they're horrible
but i still find it fun to just like
watch hockey
now the tickets are pretty expensive
right
so you have to weigh that for yourself
but like
i just i'm still like a little
kid that like i'm just anytime i'm in
the arena i'm like wow what a big
building and stuff like that like i'm
just enjoying myself
um
is basically what it comes down to
but we are bad
like we're really bad
and the last game that we saw was was
very boring by nhl standards so if
you're gonna i love this build you got
going on here by the way you're still
gonna lose but
if you're uh
if you're gonna be very disappointed if
you go to the game
and they lose
then you should not go to the game
because like
i mean like the game i said it before
but like
we
we saw the um
the flyers came to play the canucks the
kovid check-in when you got there was
like a mess
like i showed my qr code that was like
i'm vaccinated and they're like oh this
doesn't have your name on it so you have
to go to like this different line and i
got in that line and they were like oh
we don't have a scanner here just go to
this guy i went to this guy and i showed
it to him and he was like go in and i
was like you didn't even scan it and
he's like don't worry about it so
basically i just like i took like an
extra 20 minutes just to eventually hit
one guy who's like yeah you look
vaccinated i guess
anyway um
once we got
while we were in line going through this
circumstance
we had already been down one zero we
scored in line
so we didn't even see the goal
we sat down the flyers scored this is
like five minutes into the first period
and then nobody else scored for the rest
of the game that's it like we literally
there were three goals they were all
within like the first eight minutes of
the game
and we lost we witnessed one of them
because they were so front loaded and
then the rest of the game was just 0-0
like a soccer match
anyway sorry i forgot what i was talking
about but i had fun if that's the kind
of thing that would
annoy you then you probably should just
watch on tv
and i'm being serious and also like i
don't know people are calling me a
traitor because i'm going to see games
even though like
the fan base right now is like
you gotta hit them in the pockets where
it hurts let francesco aquilini know
that it's not acceptable we're gonna
wear paper bags on our heads and i'm
like man i'm just trying to like enjoy a
night
out
after
you know a year and a half with the baby
you know
i'm just trying to just trying to live
my life everyone just chill
maybe he can read qr codes it's so good
like i was i
i will i was laughing because like in
line there were other people going
through the same thing as me and they
were dropping some some very me type
comments like they'd get up to the front
of the line and be like hey just wanted
to let you guys know this is working
really well and i was like get them
[Laughter]
okay anyway um
gotta figure out where we're going long
term two three three one one him me him
me we're gonna sell a bird at some point
which means the fish would get the buff
swann would get the buff honestly i
think you could for now i think you
could totally sell a bluebird
and roll a poodle
for some scaling
we want the turtle to get the the buff
but it won't happen because the turtle
has to be in front of the caterpillar
regardless dude i honestly on round nine
i think you sell a swan to get a bison
even though the swan is
is
no well
you sell either a swan or a poodle let's
let's sell the poodle we just got it the
swan's been part of the squad
and then we can also do this i'm happy
to see you
did you see any fights
not this time but it is like
sadly
especially like
any time either the oilers or the flames
play in vancouver there's fights
ah dodo rooster wow never seen this one
before
okay
have fun
i can't believe we won that hey we dude
we also got uh
that's the believer threshold look at
that um
okay now we probably sell a swan
roll a t-rex um
and also
like uh
when the world juniors were here which
is like a a youth tournament but i mean
they're in their
late teens early twenties
uh there were tons of fights and i was
just it was like a different vibe
the vibe was was very off
during the world juniors when they were
in vancouver
normally people like they they roast the
canucks fandom because they're like ah
it's a lot of corporate suits that go
into the seats and i'm like yeah that's
you're not wrong
but there is also an element of that
that's kind of like safe
because when there's not the corporate
suits there's people who smuggle in like
you know
their own mickeys of fireball get
absolutely like blasted in the bathroom
and then just cause problems
and that that was definitely what i felt
like was happening at the world juniors
but alas this it's not that relevant
it's okay
i think we're gonna
keep the t-rex pumping we're gonna maybe
it would be nice to have two but it's
it's nice to have a level two as well
let's just send it
were you one of those in your college
days yeah but i wouldn't have started a
fight i might have said something snide
but i wouldn't have started a fight or
anything
because i would have lost i would i
would have probably got my ass beat
i have no disrespect for this build like
look at this they they have a like a an
infinity stone from every
possible archetype they have a snake
they have a turkey they have a rooster
like they they had a dog they had they
had
every single archetype represented
that's a lot they're playing all sides
so they come out on top
that's respectable in my world
we don't really need a one-up on
anything i think
i
wouldn't mind tossing you a pair
we'll freeze a pair
freeze a melon
i'm still confident that on round 12
this squad can get something done
i did see that canada somehow beat
mexico in soccer buy me pill me great
name
it's kind of amazing like uh
i mean we haven't we're top of the like
concacaf qualifiers for the world cup
right now
we haven't been to
the uh
world cup since like 1986 and
we came dead last
like we're actually like i'm not saying
we're good okay
but we're actually like kind of
competent this year
this this cycle i guess is a better way
to describe it
that's kind of sick man
i've told the story many times of how
you know i was watching canada try to
qualify for the 2014 world cup like all
they had to do was not lose to honduras
and they were gonna be in a position to
qualify and they lost to honduras like
seven to one or something
dodo rooster
dodo rooster whatever we draw
sorry sorry i i lost myself
for a second there i apologize
radiohead any radiohead fans in the chat
i mean the word this is the end game now
tony like we're just
we're just riding out this t-rex as far
as it'll go
it's a little an obscure sort of
radiohead song you might not be familiar
with it's called karma police
oops
one up on the snake
you thought you were going to get sniped
nah man now you're getting punched in
the face on this one
okay
you're gonna get buffed anyway basically
why don't you just take this
we can only spend three more gold we
might as well might as well toss it like
this
this this chili pepper is doing some
anti-rooster technology have you noticed
that
this is not a rooster i'm scared i i see
something unusual i see a pig in the
late game and i'm scared but hey you
know what
look at this
10 wins
absolute nothing wrong with that okay
dude
honestly i can't deny that was 10 wins
with a bird as well
let's put a slash marker in there slash
marker sap
one



all right straight out the dungeons of
getting uh killed
by running a stupid build let's run
another stupid build no promises that
the build will be stupid by the way look
just give me a unit with hp i love an ad
like it's so good
but i don't want to buff it with an
otter okay you know what then don't roll
the freaking otter you nerd
buy the ant buy the duck roll once and
buy a pig okay you lose but who cares
be the willing beavers
you could freeze both pigs but i i
disrespect the pig okay i disrespect the
pig i say to be honest with you a pig i
don't care to level it up i don't care i
don't mind that look you might be saying
this build is not working your duck
build's not working i think that's
because we're doing our duck building
correctly most important thing here
most important thing here
most important thing here
level up on the next turn one duck is
not gonna move the needle too much
look you're gonna laugh at me they do
have the nerf duck i don't know how they
do it but the duck if if only to create
some variety in what you see
they got to get that duck out of here a
little bit please don't buff
anything at all uh roll me once
i'm upset um we're gonna try a dog
you know what we don't have to sell the
duck yet
what if we tried this without selling a
duck
what if we sold a pig
bought a dog
sold a pig
bought a swan
rolled one time
rolled
one more time i just want to see a pill
thank you
thank you
this is a mess
[Laughter]
hold up free freeze me
by me
this is not good whatev what i have
created here is not going this is not a
squad capable of winning uh round three
it might be a squad capable of getting
to 10 wins because our dog is here and
he's starting to pop
starting to pop early that's why we're
saving up these uh
nah we're not quite making it here but
that's fine we're saving up these these
dang pigs for some beautiful buy cells
because this is a great cell
is a great buy
it's a great sell
it's an acceptable buy
it's a great pill
honestly this thing's so bad
we're gonna
roll if we're gonna do sell me by me
like we might as well go all in here
i hate to say it man i hate to say it
but i think you're gonna do something
like this thanks for buffing um thanks
for buffing um my duck i really
appreciate it thanks so much um okay you
know what we've reached peak insanity
i'm gonna sell you
i'm going to
buy you
freeze you for next time and then like
honestly this is i've lost my mind i'm
i'm in full unhinged territory a draw
would be just what the doctor ordered
here
that's very unfortunate
we draw these we draw these okay
please we teared up which is very
important just like in isaac okay just
like in isaac you're gonna pill me
you're gonna buy me
you're gonna
sell me i know this sucks okay don't add
me
you're gonna sell me
they buffed each other i i'm stunned
now we're starting to potentially do a
little bit of talking
now we're talking
maybe i don't know 10 12 dog on round
five with no equipment it's playable
i'm not sure it's going to get the job
done for us but it's playable dude our
kangaroo is going to eat them alive
this is a beautiful situation for us
our kangaroo is going gonna body you you
thought you were
the kangaroo was your ally i was born
with it molded by it all of a sudden
we're starting to build the shrimp
scampi from the ashes
of this run come a shrimp scampi
i'm not afraid you're afraid
you peace
stop buffing each other
more than anything else we really just
need garlic
george is getting upset
13 13 up at the front very nice double
snail all i'm gonna say is that a loss
right now would not be the worst thing
in the world
this is gonna be a little tricky because
that ox is gonna be
it ox is going to be a little hard to
punch through
we are going to trade with it though
which it bodes a little better for us i
can't believe we draw
that's how bad horses it draws to two
shrimps
we're gonna keep you around then um
please
honestly just for that you go toe-to-toe
versus the undertaker
this is a necessary
move here
many people would tell you it is not the
right play
to keep two scorpions frozen
but i would simply ask them hey what if
you looked at my build before you said
something like that because i honestly
think that it might be the play here i'm
this i love what they got going on here
i love that i love this uh
honey hedgehog at the back it's not
gonna get them where they need to go but
i got nothing but respect for it
lots of people out here including germa
theory crafting how to make these
hedgehog builds work i'm right there
with you i would i would also love to
see how they work
um and i would love to use them myself
at this point we have to combine
basically because
uh we get the same value and we don't
have the real estate to really
well you know i'm okay with that i'm
okay with that i'm okay with that i'm
okay with that
freeze me i know this is a very is what
it what an interesting play we got going
on here but
technically you could try this
hey by the way not trying to like be a
hater or whatever but like at any point
if you wanted to give me like a second
dog doesn't even have to be level two
but just a second dog would would really
hit the spot
that turtle's gonna be it's gonna be a
bit nasty our parrot on the other hand
is not going to be nasty at all notice
they beat us with a horse but the horse
didn't do anything that's the dream for
a horse and finally guess what
you played right into my hand
finally we get the chance to
to do something man sick of being a
nobody
we can't buy a can and uh
well no we can buy a can and a unit
rhino would probably be what most people
would think of but honestly i'm kind of
like a sheep man here
why are you still rolling a parrot
what is wrong with you man
this is really dumb
but on the other hand that's kind of
sick
dumb things kind of own
this seems like it's not going to match
up too well against your kangaroo so
that's got me
or against anything really that's got me
sweating this slightly yeah this
kangaroo is gonna eat me alive man
or is wait wait a minute now you're
gonna spit out some garbage now my
kangaroo's gonna start to think about
eating your kangaroo alive
no we're gonna lose
yes but not by like by very little
okay now we're the memory has gone too
far what am i doing you gotta go you
suck
sorry but it's true
um
buy me
you don't even need to be here get get
this squad back in order give me some
garlic man
would it be so much to ask for for but a
spot of garlic okay i know that we're
gonna roll a four squad marty you can be
mad if you want okay you can like be mad
please don't have a hippo
or a kangaroo no hippos no kangaroos
that could be worse quite frankly
like we're doing okay here
this is not this is not so bad the
garlic saved us holy cow
poutine the untouched ears is this mouse
mobile account we get four wins okay now
we're starting to now we're starting to
think okay do we maybe have something
going here maybe yes maybe no
buy me a shrimp
sell me a sheep
thank you so much buy me a cow
feed me some milk
sell the cow
now we're back okay now you could fit a
skunk here but i i can't help but feel
like we could do a little bit better
i don't know what it'll be
we don't want to combine necessarily
this is a buy sell
freeze
buy
sell
and i'm just gonna be honest with you
the risk of a hippo or a kangaroo
means i'm gonna put the cricket back
here even though it makes like it makes
more sense to buff the dog up at the
front the risk of like
animal composition on the enemy side has
me thinking twice
it's just a perfect scorpion
it's just a perfect scorpion you can't
be mad you you got red
maybe we went a little me me with that
build okay four wins is not where i want
to be in my life
let's keep it going
i will i don't mind you know what let's
start let's stop overthinking things
early freezer duck i don't mind a frozen
duck
either rolling sausages
like we're at a 7-eleven
there's no way you win this it's not the
horses it's not the horses doing the
horse just happened to exist anything
bad even a sloth back there would have
done it
copium copium
freeze me because
we wanted to see another duck but that's
okay this is good okay
now you you get a level up on a fish
sell the duck sell both beavers and then
go ham
i don't sweat this at all what do you do
what are you doing with a horse man
to be fair even a sloth would have lost
back there but
freeze me roll me
at some point we gotta commit right
wrong
sell me
sell me
what am i doing hedgehog me
grab me
meet me
you're like an actual piece
this is really bad
this this has nothing going for it
whatsoever remember when i said don't
out think yourself
this is an example of me out thinking
myself
you're so freaking lucky by the way
we almost had you even though i'm lost
in no man's land okay pill me don't hit
the duck
i didn't even have any um
like suspense
i just kind of felt like it was for sure
gonna happen
sorry
sorry to this man
it's gotta be
done and then
i know how this looks
it looks bad
because it kind of is bad
it's almost indefensible
but
now we'll level up okay
then we'll sell both ducks and we'll buy
out the whole shop
that's the game plan there's no way we
win the dog is just gonna is gonna make
short work of that if we even get to
them which we may not
well we will we'll do one damage at the
end the animals how about that okay now
this is this is where there's a real
method to my madness
it should be a combine me one time
honestly this shop absolutely blows
roll me
it's worse
sell me
sell me
i'm gonna lose my mind
i'm gonna lose my mind
you know i i mean
i mean
of course we're gonna take one of these
i guess we're gonna freeze this
i guess we're gonna do a cell
okay
and then i guess we're we're gonna do a
i guess we're gonna do a bite i guess
we're gonna add a little garlic on this
fool back here
i don't know what's happening anymore
and i'm too afraid to ask this is this
i'm not myself right now what's going on
okay
you own us
we trade
holy crap we draw that's by the grace of
god we drew on that
add one of these
you might as well if you're gonna do it
you might as well
i love a swan man at least two swans is
something
there's something to that
freeze me
freeze me okay we can we can do this we
can do this
we just need an ox
if we get an ox we've got a
mj and i we're gonna have a heck of a
time
please
we draw again i'm telling you there's
something to this
there's something to this okay
stay frozen
we're on scorpions already
that seems bad
um freeze me
unfreeze me i don't care for a snail
we're not gonna need it get a pill ready
get rid of garlic
ox
ox
ox
freeze me
there is no part of me that believes we
can make this happen
uh just to be clear
but i believe we can get to four
that's huge it's actually just yeah
again we have we have read and we have
been read that time we read
hmm this seems bad never mind we draw
me ox me you peace
screw it level up a scorpion see if i
care
you could get a second scorpion i guess
pretty easily um do we really care for a
crab we could start getting a penguin to
get some sk it's so late for plus one
plus one scaling on all your tier one
units
it's tempting i just have a serious lack
of faith
that that gets us where we're going long
term okay i just want to see an ox
i'm
being sincere
that i feel like an ox is just about the
only thing here that could actually save
us right now we're skating by because
the scorpion is taking some units by
surprise
obviously that has come to a tragic end
this kangaroo's gonna be nasty
it's still gonna be nasty man
and yet oh no you're gonna spawn a
rooster okay fair enough
fair enough
where does redemption lie for us we
don't we don't give up hope yet there's
gonna be an ox
when we get that ox it's all gonna fall
into place man
okay uh it's time for the crab to go
it's
i guess we could have rolled up it's
time for the fish to go
good point good point then
honestly hold on hold on
you could not in good consciousness
recommend this
didn't we get a plus two plus two off of
that instead
[Laughter]
sell me
by me
kill me
run me
[Laughter]
oh he's lost his mind i know i hear you
in the comments he's fully lost he's
fully lost his mind yeah well get ready
to lose this you peace
we win these okay i realize we have a
problem our badger is so strong that it
kills our ox outrights
it does 34 damage we're only blocking
24. well we're only blocking 20. um so
we need
to not do that i guess so
everybody just relax but we gotta we got
some more problems in it at our disposal
here and that's okay we're gonna work
through this together
you having garlic would be very really
nice
for the squad in general would have been
nice maybe perhaps if we had kept our uh
if we'd kept our level three in order to
make that bison pop but this water under
the bridge at this point i would say um
you know
what are you doing
i don't think we're gonna live to see
the other side of this shop
me my melon armor you peace
um we win these
i'm lost like i don't feel like i have a
grip on
reality right now much less like the
game
sure there you go you know what might
not toss the second badger you know we
could actually
we could actually roll that badger up at
the front and then another badger at the
back now we're talking
please please no reads on the scorpion
you peace
nice try nice try
okay you know what that's a
problem we win these i am i'm lost i
can't believe this is working it's not
really working so to speak
let's get insane
what level of insanity you feeling right
now
i'm not willing to sell my scorpion or
my swan to make this happen
just just being
100 straight up with you i'm you know
what i mean there's something to be said
about that i know he comes back as a 1-1
but that's like anti-melon armor
technology
we we also get a second like plus six
out of it or something why not man i
don't know it's probably the only way we
survive through this
if we survive through this which we
won't
hold on hold on
hold on hold on we draw these
we're still in it somehow
nobody needs garlic
i like i don't even know what i'm
rolling for
i'm just i'm just rolling for fun man
i'm rolling for sport
tiger i just don't even know where you'd
put it
i'm just clicking
non-negotiable
if we get the six wins on this build
it's the worst build we've ever had that
has done that this is also the most draw
heavy build i've ever seen in my life
okay we break your melon armor not that
it actually matters
and we do we do lose this one
but it was fun while it lasted hey i'm
gonna roll one more back like let's do
one more
semi-serious one
okay
having fun is all well and good but
let's actually like try
how does that sound
the low-key masseuses like yeah i'll
give you a masseuse just don't tell
anybody the first rule of getting the
massage is you don't tell anybody you're
getting a massage
we win these
how long has it been since we won a
round one i feel like it's been a long
time
i don't mind i don't mind
i don't like to but you know what if it
helps us get to a level three or a tier
three faster i'll take it
we draw these hey that's not so bad
considering the way that went down i i
respect it
the run respector has logged on see this
is beautiful
because we can buy
we can sell
we can buy
you could freeze you could freeze
we don't need to buy both of these to
win this one you can roll
twice
i'm just gonna say i'm probably gonna
become the joker at some point maybe
like today maybe today
i don't even just don't
get out of here i'm gonna deliberately
roll a four squad marty i don't wanna
see i don't wanna see you
can't can't can't justify it
how did this happen
everything was looking so good and now i
got a i got a 5'4 duck in the front
what's happening man
okay we lose these and deserve to i'm
getting too into the the meta just got
to remember number go up
when number goes up we're happy
dude honestly screw it
i'm i'm keeping this duck
your opportunity to get me to get rid of
that duck is long gone
now we got an eight six unbuffed duck at
the front okay
and i'm not sweating
we're gonna everybody thought ducks were
only things that you could buy and sell
nah man
it's duck's revenge get ready like
five seconds ago i was like all right
one more serious one now i'm like ducks
revenge man absolutely of course makes
perfect sense i'm gonna buy one of these
i'm gonna pill it
you're honestly kind of slap in the face
but i respect you for it
you can fit a crab in here you don't
have to though
we definitely do want an ox at some
point
frieza's snail
i think i think you just played it
simple man i think you just add a swan
you just add a swan
i think you say no to a crab
i think you say no to a dodo
i don't know what i'm doing i'm a
different man now i'm not the same man i
was at the start of this video
disrespect swan or sorry disrespect uh
skunk is what i meant to say by the way
you just got beaten by a snail
you love to see it
this is exactly why i kept you around
take one of those and call me in the
morning
um
way too late for a dog
a duck on the other hand
[Laughter]
a duck on the other hand you know what
screw it
i'm all in
14 14 7 duck screw it 14 7 duck
this ain't the sort of thing you expect
to see every day oops you're dead
oops you're dead
okay i'm dead you got look honestly you
got good ant luck on that one i can't
even be mad how we do are we on lethal
no no no no okay so we're still we got a
lot of room to work with
combine me
buy me
yum me
kill me
buy me
croc me
it's a bit of a scary sound huh
ooh
selmy this is insane what am i doing
freeze me
this seems uh
really interesting
amoeba early amoeba
that's all right we get a melon armor
out of it you get a melon armor guess
what i got a melon armor guess what
nice microbe you pay to win
scumbag
i'm just messing with you i run the
microbot on occasion as well um how
about one of these
how about one of these how about we peel
ya
how about we buff you
i'm just going to be straight up with
you man
how about we throw a little penguin into
the mix
how about we get a duck even
your duck is breaking me higher
than i ever been lifted before
it's okay what the heck
we win these no sweat
okay that's five wins with the super
duck
sure i guess i'll get you to like level
three or whatever
why not right
i'll be like straight up with you
i think you actually do this
and i'm like i'm losing my mind this is
not the way you should play super auto
pets
but it might be the way that you choose
to play super auto pets after you've
played a lot of super auto pets
you might enter you might reach a phase
of your life where you're like screw it
meat level three meat duck
why not nice try
nice try nice try we win these
okay now we have three pretty trash
units but they do help our scaling i
respect that a great deal what do you
think about adding another duck to the
squad no no okay sure fine whatever
what you you don't like winning
i'll be straight up with you give me a
cat
and then we start talking about adding
some foods into the ecosystem
i'd sell a swan to start feeding some
double milks
this should not last too long
and yet
nevertheless
seven wins
many people are saying this is not
possible
yeah it's it's late enough i think you
could totally sell this one i know we
lose the buff off of it but it's fine
it's fine
it's better this way
now we get bodied by a scorpion so let's
keep a scorpion around because the best
anti-scorpion technology is a scorpion
oh let's go
holy cow
now the question becomes what do we fear
most
i'll be real with you i think we we fear
a scorpion the most
so
this is not my my regular play but my
regular play has been getting me bodied
so sure let's toss in a little scorpion
up front here
i like it we didn't exactly read them
but i'll take it
that takes us to eight i mean a level
three duck 10
win would be kind of amazing
want to see cats maybe
i'll take a penguin
we got room to work with here i'll
i'll take a cow i'll take a cow
okay keep it running we're gonna we're
gonna keep him trying here
please
scorpion technology does not work okay
it's bad this is bad this is bad but
it's also kind of typical
no there's no way you're making it
through this one but we accept that
friends don't let friends play dodo
chicken or dodo rooster dodo chicken
i'll allow
scorpion was was complete trash for us
there we need um melon armor on this
duck
thank you
thank you so much
uh then
straight up
weirdest buy sell of all time many
people are saying this
what if you just happen to toss a snake
like right in the middle here
50 48 duck please please
let it be the change we got it
get red you peace
i'll see you in the finals here we go
nine win level three duck build to bring
us back
you can now sell all your scalers
for a tiger
not not a monkey not a cat even though
it would take us up a level it's too
late
for a tiger and the eye thereof
sell me
it this is very precious sell me
buy me
feed me
sell me
buy me
don't get sniped
if we draw we'll be happy we got that
snake don't get sniped
don't get sniped
we want to see
no snipe technology please
they've got a very similar build but our
snake goes first
kind of oh my god we're going to get 10
wins the 10-win duck many people did not
think this was possible print screen
he's back thanks for watching hope you
enjoyed the episode i'll see you next
time
see ya



hello to all gamers we are back playing
some super auto pets
you love to see it
what did we do last step free to play
beta win free to play between i think we
well you know what you know what you do
you go you go back into the old youtube
archives
oh no it takes a second for my
hard drive to like instance all these
videos we're just gonna let's let's keep
it rolling man
i'm sorry i just drank a bunch of water
that's sincere i got the water burps
right now they don't even taste good or
nothing um
let's let's take a beetle here's my new
meta okay it's really hard to counter
duck meta it's really popular right now
i think the way that you counter duck
meta
one thing you can do
is you don't have to be as
anal about
super strong teams
you can i feel like a bird is much more
rollable now i'll be the dry sausages
who doesn't like a salumi
with a little a bit of halloumi on the
side knowing you run into ducks so often
i feel like you can definitely afford to
take like a bird that scales you a
little bit even though i don't think a
bird is good really to begin with um
put me there for a second i'd rather
have apple no you know what i think i'd
rather have b than apple
then give me a combine
and then honestly i thought about buying
some bee but like let's just get this
going
i don't mind this we're going to go up a
level next time
it's the one thing i was especially from
playing so much verses today on the
stream um i don't know how you stop
wow that was close uh
doc amanda once you get to round three
if somebody is 17 ducks
and they sell them this is incredible by
the way if somebody has 17 ducks and
then they sell them and buy like a bunch
of dodos or they buy basically one dodo
that's like six six and then they feed a
dog or something like that i genuinely
don't really know
what you can do about that to avoid
just feeding them
uh
but
i also think in arena we're gonna have a
level three next time holy crap
um
i don't think we need the fish um this
is this is kind of exceptional
the puppy's already 4-3 we can the law
the better the rest of our squad is the
longer we can keep a bird around
although we did just basically say no to
taking that bird to level two by rolling
past it but alas i digress um
in arena it's not so bad because you
don't face the same team over and over
again so that might make a difference
you're gonna be level three that's just
nutty i think we can go pretty hard on
scaling here
like i think i could
because you're going to give plus three
i think we could give you
um an apple because i do want to give
you garlic at some point and then i
think we could sell
and then i think we can buy
and we're going to freeze
a
a tropical fish
this might this is a kind of a weird
four squad but this is how we get the
puffy the puppy buffed i say it every
time at this point it would be weirder
if i didn't mispronounce it but um so we
definitely lose this one but i think we
got great kind of optics for the future
what we want to do is at some point get
rid of the bird and add like a
caterpillar i was going to say a
helicopter
so something like that i mean this this
is just how you start to begin with here
and then we probably want something like
this because i think we're going to
stick with this ladybug which is
actually a beetle
like this is a nasty looking squad for
turn five
the two units we have that aren't that
impressive are doing a great job of
feeding it forward for us
like we actually win this even against
that strong dog
chibs
great name great name reminds me of
someone i know
um
like you could add some equipment in
here this is very nice quite frankly
because we know we want this
uh we want a caterpillar
that's just it's just what you take i
think the time has come to sell a
bluebird and roll a caterpillar but we
can wait uh one round
because for the time being we can get
one more buff out of it we make sure the
money lines up for the puppy to be fine
garlic on the puppy the puppy's gonna be
a bit of a menace especially considering
it's level two hey you know what i do as
much as i talk smack about like a white
weenie build um
i do have to admit i'm a little scared
of a white weenie build that has given
up on the horse
that was like we're equally matched that
if they put a horse in there instead i
think it all goes terribly wrong for
them but with no horse i'm i'm very
content with this and now i think we can
maybe do something like this
we can buy one thing
i'll go i'll go a little bit more in on
the tropical fish keep the scaling going
there hp matters
puppy's still getting strong
i don't mind this
i think we got a nice a nice team here
if i if i could say some negative things
i do think our puppy showed up like one
turn later than i would have liked
obviously you know it's kind of
ridiculous to talk about that on a turn
where we also just like stomped but
you know it is worth mentioning maybe
i'm going to feed you
and we can buy one more thing literally
my one more thing on this one is
rerolling
the faster i can get you leveled the
happier i am
okay i yeah you know what i think it's
maybe a great time to sell a tropical
fish and add a bison into the ecosystem
although i guess like just adding
another caterpillar is also an
interesting way to think about it
i'm sure there's like there's a
mathematical approach you could take
here hold on are we in a lot of trouble
we're in a lot of trouble
let's see this is a strong dog man
maybe focus on getting the first
caterpillar to pop first
keep the swan for a second here
for now
uh excuse me it didn't freeze
you know what that might have worked out
better um
we can't really fit a dragon because we
have to sell two things to make it
happen
on the other hand you know what
just freeze me for a moment here because
like i'm i'm pretty fond of how this
looks right now
we got to keep the
the beetle around
dog and caterpillar should work pretty
well we don't have snipers they don't
keep the mfping thing on them which is
great news for us this is a win
but like it's not it's no longer like
guaranteed 10. the fact that i'm i'm
feeling a little bit tapped at uh
f5 kind of scares me
but we're only on round 10. you know i
think i think you actually say the bison
is worth less as a scaler than than
really scaling these units up quickly so
we say thank you for your service but no
thank you for your service we're gonna
buy you we're going to buy you
we're going to sell you for the time
being we do still want to stay at 2 gold
which is unfortunate but
keep in mind this is basically double
buffing
start there
i'll just be honest with you we don't
need a 2-2 or a 3-3
we can sell you
get the buffs on whomever
and then roll me freeze me just this is
i i like these rolls man i'll just be
honest with you um we really want to
chocolate the dragon to get the double
buffing happening because we really do
only have two good units and you know in
in a in the world where scorpions exist
that can be a bit of a problem
this is it's going to be fine for now i
i feel like my confidence is coming back
like i found a nice seam
i don't think we're gonna need to buff
our puppy
to me it seems unnecessary what does
seem nice though is is chocolate on the
dragon because a level two dragon would
help us out
six that's good that's good because then
we could do a buy sell
and still get the buff it's probably a
buy
a cell
you know if i'm if i'm being honest with
you i think our best
game changer is a steak
a steak on the dragon is probably worth
more than just adding in like an eagle
scene isn't it
or is it maybe it's not spicy at all
maybe it's actually completely fine
this takes us what this will be seven
wins
okay this is not an atypical build by
the way
holy birch
like this is uh
this is a pretty classic sort of setup
we got going on here it's just a puppy
caterpillar and then we added a little
dragon kicker to it
roll once
this is what i wanted
i think because we're not on lethal i
think we can afford the way to turn
and then get the level 2 dragon next
time we're keeping the snail just in
case all right well you're frozen the
cricket
i don't even see the cricket as a level
one that's how much i value it okay this
is it's not that bad it's not as bad as
it could have been
what are we at now we're at eight that
does come after seven so it makes sense
that makes sense
we don't have i know what you're
thinking but it doesn't really work for
us to like sell buy
make a level two have a level two and a
level one because then what do you sell
you sell the beetle okay then you're
buffing a puppy for no reason we really
the buffs are focused on you and you
right now so the the fact that there's a
level two matters
uh and and we need the space more than
anything else so sell me
might as well buy me
we we can't really make it work honestly
they have different philosophies but
it's it's a great time for some buying
and selling and keep in mind now that
our puppies maxed out we can actually
like spend to the cap
no thank you
you know
i'm i'm a big believer
in honestly like just a weird scorpion
like just just run in some weird kind of
strategies
put a scorpion out there like in the
middle in case the first unit has melon
armor
all right um
this is what's called getting red in the
business this is what's known as getting
red
and yet still
we did a lot of damage
okay this is looking really good for all
my complaints
like this this is looking really good
i'm keeping this frozen look i love a
scorpion okay
in fact i love a scorpion so much that i
think what we have right now
is kind of the dream setup
if it goes wrong
now we got the whole squad
if it all goes wrong
we know we can we can buy level ones we
can cycle up we can do turtles like
it'll be fine
but it's not gonna happen look at it
okay i'm feeling great all right there's
an arena win
it was it the most groundbreaking when
you've ever seen in your life absolutely
not but at least like i've recovered
from the the confidence destroying
performance i had against mouth in the
arenas today
i think bluebird bluebird did some good
work for us there but i also think food
build can be kind of fun so let's try a
little food meta here
i'll be the inedible i'll be the stormy
tugboat
that's what you wanted as any port in a
storm right
all right let's let's keep it going here
you you run up look this is a an
interesting squad
i i got nothing but respect for this two
squad otter plus b
very interesting i'm a little
disappointed
that we didn't run into ducks because
those are usually like an easy win um
let's let's eat up a little
because then you get the buff as well
and then let's now we gotta all of a
sudden we got a three four now we got a
two four
this is a tough squad to beat
round two two four two four two four
three four two one that buffs it's a
very similar looking squad from our
opponent here for the record and
unfortunately a 2-4 and a 2-3 trade but
unfortunately for them a 2-4 beats a 2-2
straight up
i think at this stage of the game you're
pretty much forced to roll dog
i and i
i don't it's weird but hear me out
combine
buy
now the dog gets one extra hp you guys
get buffed and the swan gets one extra
hp
which i actually like
freeze me
because i think that like these units
getting a guaranteed buff
is is very nice for us we have capacity
to work with next turn so we we haven't
lost a single round yet we still have 10
hp this round we could lose it um but i
think our beetle's pretty sick honestly
it sucks they didn't get the buff but
they're still they're still munching
some numbers here
we win this okay great stuff great stuff
um we're looking for a level up as well
we're lucky to get one so you get pilled
we're not selling anything yet you just
get pilled you get buffed which is kind
of incredible
let's let's add a level into the
ecosystem it buffs the dog
i think you you have a serious
obligation to consider it at the very
least
and if you're gonna do that you should
really do it right away and the dog in
the swan will scale
the cat's in the cradle in the silver
spoon
um sure sure
i don't mind this man we got a 4-5 dog
it's almost like it's a nice luxury to
be in a position where you're like my
dog needs to be sheltered because
they're not doing very much double
meat's gonna be a bit of an issue here
never mind i was just basically
you know sandbagging for no reason i
apologize that is what scared me when i
first saw it it turned out to not be
that big of a deal
um
i will buff you well i'll just level you
i guess i should say i am not in love
with this shot let's think about this
for a moment i think this is okay
we could i don't need you don't need to
freeze an apple you can do better
i like this
let's get you going as fast as possible
more garlic for the future
you're probably seeing what our issue is
right here though which is that we have
a dog that is no longer like doing
anything
the dog is our scaling engine but it has
no scaling honey badger okay ram is is a
good get that's gonna help out the dog a
little bit but it it happens
you piece
we act we we lose these to honey badger
that's a nice honey badger build i'm
gonna say that the ram from the spider
was the difference there
um
we have to say goodbye to something and
i like
the wrong place to sell the dog though i
know it's what most people would want to
see you need the dog as a scaler like it
it's worth less than that ladybug and
and the green beetle like that's worth
something too
i gotta figure out what the heck i'm
gonna do with it but it is you know it
has value
this takes us to six that's a nice
number right now because we can just
shove a spider right here now we got a
freaking nine seven garlic armored dog
we do want it to be behind the spider
still
caterpillar is getting close it's it's
gonna come out as a nine seven
slightly better than a 6 8 kind of if
you don't if you really don't run the
numbers
that's really bad this is insanely great
for their kangaroo
we must lose this then
come on man
we draw this okay i'll take the draw
because the caterpillar is getting close
to popping i think we're paying the
price now for not leveling the dog
earlier which is fine like i'll
okay now like i hate to say it the
spider's got to go i know you'd probably
rather wait for a pill and one other
thing has to go and i think it's got to
be
the beetle for now
and then
we got like a double bias energy here
which is actually extremely valuable
i think you're going to be looking at
like a buy
cell buy
sell
buy
we could have done that with a llama
frozen a turtle instead probably would
have been better but
you know for the time being
we've got a very wide squad
[Laughter]
i don't know if that's good for us but
i'm not that pessimistic honestly like i
i think we got kind of some sick stuff
going on here i know we are going up
against the horse the thing with the
horses i'm always just like
i just don't want to die to the horse
because it would be embarrassing
and we win this because horses are
garbage there was never a doubt in my
mind
it's funny because like you can we have
enough space to get a second caterpillar
going but we don't have enough space on
our squad
unless
now i do look i want the melon armor
but there is a part of me that's also
like
okay pill me
freeze me because you're in a surplus
spot right now anyway
this kid we'll just treat this as a buy
sell for a second
we might not roll it okay
we need the space back man
if we get another pill i'll be happy to
buy the eagle
or as just like an additional kind of
part of the squad i wouldn't mind i
wouldn't i wouldn't mind you know what
i'd rather have a 6'5 eagle than a 2-2
um
than a 2-2 ram i think
i don't know what it could spit out that
would help me maybe a gorilla could
actually do something right now but
well our melon armor is gonna get no
it's not gonna get eaten we're actually
in a situation where being bad is good
i do hate this turkey build though i
think we'll probably go down just
because turkey is like insane
at least we get to kill both
i don't know maybe it's i wouldn't say
it's close but it's close
maybe it depends on spider here
you get five
you're so lucky i mean you still lost so
never mind and that felt amazing by the
way
i love beating the turkey build it just
look maybe it's not cool to say but it
just feels nice um you need one of these
for sure
double cow is just like crazy talk and
honestly i mean it depends whether you
want to go for like a super like the
distributed buff from bison to
caterpillar or if you want to do like uh
you know everybody gets to take a little
buff instead
but i think we just give it all to the
bison quite frankly
um and i think we freeze our t-rex roll
once
i would not mind buying a buffalo um my
whole game plan here
is that
i guess you could buy one more thing
then
but what
sell me
buy me
no
the dog is not long for this world the
dog is going to get replaced with a
scorpion i'm on x games mode now we're
going to roll a four squad marty the
swan's going to give us extra gold every
turn then we're going to throw a t-rex
in for super scaling it could work it
could work
dude buffalo plus dog is kind of cracked
low key high key major key it doesn't
matter it's cracked
put some respect on it
you gotta stop rolling the horses into
turn eight i don't if you roll them turn
one like you know you lose one hp who
cares it's your funeral
if you roll them this late in the game
like you're just feeding other people
free wins
we can only buy one more thing none of
this really matters i would roll for
something more valuable
i don't think we got it but you just
freeze it here anyway and that's fine
tutu on everything is pretty good this
dog is falling off the swan at least has
an effect the dog has some serious
problems on the on the other hand we do
appear to be rolling uh up against the
dog with every round that we play so as
long as we're seeing dogs i think we
could probably keep playing dogs
this takes us to seven
i mean you kind of need melon armor but
more than that we need like to replace
you with a turtle so that our
caterpillar pops
dude honestly
like be a hater i don't care
i know that seems like an insane play
what can i say like maybe i'm kind of an
insane dude
i i for real think that's the play now
we're down hold on six
two
four
i don't mind
i don't
mind it
this
is now much better
excuse me thank you thank you i got so
scared that i like screwed something up
there
now the turtle will pass melon armor
onto our 4343
way way better than having what was it
like a 20 20 with garlic armor like even
though it uses two spots to accomplish
it like it's the juice is definitely
worth the squeeze
that's nine that's eight okay i mean we
could totally get to ten i'm not saying
it's it's for sure set in stone but like
it's certainly possible this is
something i love to keep around as like
an ultimate just in case
a t-rex hitting a level up would be huge
we don't really get to do anything else
on this turn
honestly you might think i'm crazy on
this one buff the swan a little bit the
the
bison buffalo whatever i'm not good with
these animals the the buffalo's gonna
get there anyway
i this looks like the squad of a person
who had to give up way too much for a
late game rooster pivot and i i mean
nothing but respect when i say that i've
been there
dude what the heck i'm back i'm back and
i'm cracked
it's happening
let me get that t-rex up though it
always it always feels nice forget the
cows i'm going for it
thank you thank you
gaming and a good gaming to you sir and
the good gaming to you
we in my opinion we could actually now
sell a swan
we don't need the gold anymore now we go
to five
buy a cow
feed
anything i mean like the t-rex or the
turtle really probably feed the turtle i
guess
as weird as it
sounds and then roll this i was thinking
of rolling you know what you're already
so buffed
even though we got a level 2 t-rex just
put a little scorpion in here i think
this is enough
my my gamer foo tells me this is enough
i regret nothing
two of these i we still win like you
it's just it's a nasty squad man
that's 210 spots and let me tell you
i gotta work on my versus game
but man oh man
arena still got it hey thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed it if you did
click the like button helps out a great
deal of course subscribe you want to see
more in the future for now thanks for
watching thanks for your support on
super auto pets and i'll see you next
time see ya
i gotta find the stop recording button
see ya



hey everybody welcome back super auto
pets i'm i'm feeling good
let's go pay to win i can't remember if
we were free to play or pay to win last
time but been having a good time mixing
it up i've been playing uh free to play
on my phone because i don't want to log
in because my password is like 116
characters long or something ridiculous
so let's let's play some pay to win now
that i'm on the main
the main marty i totally think in a
duck-based world you can roll a bluebird
for a bit i think you can roll a
bluebird that makes your fish a little
bit more potent
maybe the untouched balls i know this is
one of the rare times i think that uh a
name needs no
explanation or expectation
we win these i mean we draw these but we
won because we have scaling so that's a
win in my book we ever see them again
they know they're toast
um
i like red and green combined i don't
like red and green in a vacuum i totally
think you can roll this you got a
freaking 6'4 fish
doesn't have any chance of leveling up
in all likelihood right now but
just in general it's kind of sweet huh
eight five fish at the back the awkward
husband's great name wouldn't know what
that's like
i am married but i stay very
self-assured
i love it i love this
give me a combine give me a swan
roll me
so many great
viable options here
um i think if you want to win
you go dog
i just don't know how yet and it's kind
of boring hello tomo by the way you're
gonna come make an appearance
um let's do a combine
a swan
a fish and we'll just
put make that fish part of the ecosystem
um this i think will probably be my last
fish buff
then we'll combine swan start buffing
the swan because the swan is more likely
to stick around
namely because it has some utility
uh beyond just existing i don't mind
look we lost to ducks it's
understandable it happens from time to
time this squad i sleep
the sleeping has now ended
give me a combine
and a bi i'm i'm in duck mode or a dog
mode even though we don't have a dog you
got good hp let's go to something like
this going outside of bat into the
ecosystem let's roll should be looking
for pills i do not see one
toss me another swan roll me i do not
see one frees me a bat though and all of
a sudden
i'm feeling pretty good we got a seven
seven swan a bat an eight five fish like
these are some positive things
we got to figure out what to do with the
ant that's why i'm like you know i'm
stalling for a pill
which is not always the way that i would
oh no
it's not always the way i'd suggest
doing this but even with those two
losses i feel very good about my team in
general like i like this
decently um i like this
you know with the level two swan
i'm gonna start to think about a worm
this is what i wanted to see hold the
front door though okay if we want to win
forget this forget the permanent buff
here
and prepare to we're going to dump
something i don't know what it is yet
if we want to win right now
you get out of my face this this could
cost me the game right here not to
not to you know bury the lead not to
make the game seem more dramatic than it
actually is
but this if this 1411 fish gets two
kills i will be happy
oh my god replacing the meat was way
more important than applying the
weakness but this is very nice okay
we draw
that's i we don't need to win we just
need to survive because our scaling is
off the flipping charts right now um the
bats gonna go
and that's gonna be controversial and i
welcome that controversy
but i think we're on turn six i totally
think we're early enough to get a worm
going i don't really like applying a
salad that kind of scares the crap out
of me in that case let's just add a fish
into the ecosystem at some point we're
going to want to get rid of this bird
not the swan the swan is precious we
only peel those you know once a month by
accident this is uh
extremely lucky i would say
it turns out my luck was highly
overstated
we're gonna be on lethal but this is
like a strong unless i've lost my mind
this is a pretty strong team to be on
lethal with
like this worm it doesn't take much for
it to get up there
that's pretty sick man hold on
i'm gonna be honest i'm not gonna buy it
yet but i'm gonna feed you like just a a
small apple if that's okay and then
we're gonna try something like that
we're gonna we're gonna buff
our tankiest unit with the hatching
chick and then just keep that swan pump
in maybe the blue maybe that's a
representation that the bluebird doesn't
need to hang around forever i don't know
i'm not comfortable with that kind of
rhetoric but maybe you are all of a
sudden the worm not looking so stupid
not looking like it's going to be a
two-run video maybe it'll be a three-win
video maybe it'll be a 10-win video that
remains to be seen
while we're here you know what
that's what i like to see just buy me
out here
round eight looking at a 21-19 garlic
worm
not exactly my ideal restaurant order
i see a rooster that has not yet gotten
into its prime that's what we need to
see this is terrible news
is absolutely horrendous news we we lose
this it's a two to win video with that
squad uh-uh i say uh out of that
congrats to you
like we we didn't lose to anything where
i was like oh it's like a scummy build
i'm a little embarrassed though be the
be the be the suspicious teabags like
how long has that been in the cupboard
does tea go bad
what kind of i've heard of tazzo what
the heck is t-zo
you know it's just a little suspicious
we draw these against the team that was
honestly a little better than us this is
for redemption like ripped to you if
you're playing me right now
but
being built different starts now
i'm honestly surprised like i
i think the worm is one of those units
that just like
it's that's tough ant luck but
that's tough ant luck we will probably
lose this
we will probably draw this actually just
again demonstrating the inefficacy of a
horse
i see
interesting
um
pill one
i know you get a temporary buff
a permanent buff okay in that case just
welcome i know the order might seem a
little scuffed here i personally would
not be inclined to disagree with you for
the record the order is kind of a little
scuffed
maybe it will freeze you and instead of
going up a level i actually feel kind of
comfortable like hitting this but please
don't hit you that's all i ask okay
that's fine and then
buying you and just rolling three of
these sons of guns here
that can't be a good idea it's so much
more valuable
not even like that's fine but it's so
much more valuable to have a unit
much more likely to live
i don't mind this like it's it's not a
great three squad but it's okay
that's pretty bad
that's kind of terrible luck for us
meat on a peacock goes a long way the
peacock was tanky to begin with
um
okay for the time being i don't mind a
little eating here
which allows us to put out a better bat
and a better owl
and then let's freeze some uh meat
this squad is unimpressive we have zero
wins but do keep in mind we only have
one loss a seven eight up at the front
is going to be pretty solid
weakness on the back dog
i gotta feel like that's gonna get us
there see that's much better you roll
the owl until you you have to
take that space for something else i
don't know maybe you maybe you upgrade
an owl that's pretty rare
i don't know is it too late for a dog
i know i didn't take a dog last time i
couldn't shake the feeling though that i
was kind of like deliberately nerfing
myself so how about um hear me out here
you get out of there let's roll two owls
let's give you some garlic
i am going to
sell a mosquito buy a puppy
freeze a
freeze a salad
unfreeze the meat
i'm not confident this squad is winning
right now but if especially if we can
get a level two puppy
oh my god what the heck is this
this is like this is somebody who and i
can relate to this this is not throwing
stones this is someone who's played the
game too much recently
and is trying to regain their enjoyment
that being said can i also say i respect
it maybe they're actually just because
technically if you have two caterpillars
you might not be going for two
butterflies you might just be creating a
situation where you're you want to have
one butterfly but you get there twice as
fast or like three times as fast in this
case
um i don't respect any of these animals
go ahead be mad
let's do uh i don't even think we need a
salad buy now that i'm looking at it and
we can only buy one more thing okay i'm
gonna buy some salad
at least you get a little buff we're
gonna stay here which means you belong
up here now we need garlic on the puppy
but we need more puppies like 2-2 per
turn is not gonna get us there long-term
it can do something for a little bit but
it's gonna fall off
we got so lucky with the spider luck
there i mean normally it pays out with
trash so maybe we didn't get lucky maybe
we got like the statistical average but
i'll take it
i mean i got to be real with you if
you're sticking around for a minute then
like let's let's go full on with the
buffs here we literally can't buy
anything else so we will freeze this
we're looking for
a reason
this is good
um
we're looking for a reason to sell these
owls like we we've held onto them
they've done a little work for us which
is great we want to dump them before
they disappoint us what the heck is
going on with this ox here i have to
feel like that was just accidental maybe
lucky us we i'll take that win
okay two three one this is a perfect
poodle squad right now we just need a a
good tier five
so we're gonna i think we should sell
an owl
then after that we're gonna buy the
poodle we're gonna sell the other owl
that's fantastic man
okay
we can buy you know a llama would kind
of hit this well no llamas tier four it
would be a little weird you can take
this for sure we can roll once and buy
one thing
um
i honestly think you just roll like food
strats for now it's nice to scale a unit
that doesn't really scale
and everything gets plus one plus one
more puppies more poodles almost any
animal that starts with pee
what about porcupine um they're called
hedgehogs in this game i wouldn't expect
you to understand double melon pretty
much means nothing when they it hits
your scaling units but
honestly i've been playing a little bit
this weekend i've got a new archetype
here and you just gotta go with me all
right my new archetype is actually a
badger at the front
tank it up level 350 50 if you can right
behind it place your scaling unit like a
monkey
your badger hits something kills it
blows up kills your scaling unit who
cares because it's it already served its
purpose by giving you plus two plus two
in the shop
um if it's a monkey for example you
could say with a penguin like a
penguin's not there to win you the game
in battle it it's a strategist right so
the badger kills a unit in usually if
you buff it right
then
maybe kills another unit
kills your scaler and usually you're
losing your scaler for like their second
strongest unit it's a very groovy
combination
now
our scorpion will get buffs
the ultimate question i guess is do we
care
instead of our scorpion getting buffs i
don't think a mammoth even with one up
is the right way to do it
i do think a rhino could work but you
know me like i'm kind of a like i'm a
sicko
i kind of like the idea of a scorpion
getting stronger even though it's gonna
happen at a glacial pace
i feel like most
enemies will not be
running anti-scorpion tech right now
that's fine the dodo rooster is just
like i get it you got it congrats you
probably ran duck meta in the early game
um you're probably a piece you know it
is what it is i'm not gonna
look i'm not gonna pay to level up a
scorpion by one instead i'll buy the
sushi and have that do it for me
hmm well um i don't think there's a
problem
with a cell
by
we lose our scorpion at the front
basically no matter what here unless you
don't want to get the puppy buff but we
definitely do we'll just roll an ant
temporarily and keep the puppy scaling
the puppy is more look we didn't really
lose it we lost the 1-1 scorpion so what
does that mean we lost a scorpion the
stats are irrelevant obviously now the
math is bad for us
that's not so bad would you look at that
okay i always love beating the dodo even
in its nerfed form
um
it's sad but like
the poodle needs this the most
i think that's a given
and i think we're scaling too slowly
who's our level three puppies are level
three so let's put you
here it's all about trying to get that
puppy scaling while also maintaining
like the
the best possible team composition like
it it really helps us if we can get one
extra thing
per uh
per battle um this seems bad
it's a cool squad i don't mind that
squad
i've become very squad judgmental i
wouldn't disagree
we might get hard stuck at six here
melon is pretty important
i think we maybe gotta think about doing
something like that
we kind of need to fish for
i mean that's really good
i really don't want to go a turn without
the puppy scaling
wish me the best
[Laughter]
i don't know at round 12 132 32 with a
level two bat really is your only other
option
i'm not fully sold that scorpion got got
extremely nerfed yeah okay fair enough
copium addict you got me noticing some
similarities here seeing seeing a lot of
uh
i don't love this but you got to play
the cards you doubt
seeing a lot of um
we don't i don't care about a fish
anymore i think a fish fell way down
that's perfect the the power rankings uh
after
the early game essentially became
completely meaningless as a result to
the the change to the hp system mind you
i'll still take it i've been playing
pyrrhic a little bit on my phone too
that is a pyrrhic victory by the way
because you got that that duck build
i think we're gonna buff you because
you're going to stick around for at
least a few battles here i'm not sold on
another ant though and i'm really not i
think we just stay here and enjoy our
two ladybugs um
but yeah we're seeing a lot of dodos
we're seeing a lot of roosters
a lot of dogs i mean the dog i have no
there's no hate in my heart for that you
know it's uh
it's a typical build that makes a lot of
sense because it gives you a reliable
engine i'm foolish for not taking one
myself not honorable foolish
it's early i think we kind of got it it
also gives us those guaranteed level ups
i love so much
um
freeze me roll me
we're gonna you know be the change we
want to see in the world let's uh let's
buy the let's buy the dog
freeze this
unfreeze this combine me buy a dog next
turn we get to do i love a buy me sell
me it might be like my favorite
archetype i love i love you know brain
empty uh just hitting end turn button
and scaling into you know infinity as
well but there's no way we win this one
six six fish is way too strong
we do kill you that's gonna feel good
smoochum's mcweiner what a name what a
name okay now we have some fun this is a
kill me
honestly we could
pill you
and then we get to sell the cricket back
but it's kind of a it's a bit of an
it's a bit of a an ask
do you sell for two you do sell for two
so this actually like turns a profit
which is kind of funny um i for real
think you can roll a flamingo we'll
probably sell our pig
i'm gonna roll once more
freeze me
the the problem is you have to do a lot
of buying and selling right and if you
got to do
a lot of buying and selling
um some of the units are are better than
others this seems kind of horrible
i think this yeah yeah yeah this seems
pretty bad okay we're still in the game
though the caterpillar plus the dog is a
classic scaling engine it's not just
pure copia my promise
um are you sticking around or are we
gonna try to fit like a puppy in here i
think we have to fit a bison
sell me
by me
even though the bison won't pop yet it's
this is worth something
it's already our best unit which is a
little sad
freeze me
roll me
freeze me
this is the biggest like buy you you'll
ever see in your life
um
this seems okay i can live with this
let's freeze this
well we're gonna need that garlic at
some point if we lose this round i'm
gonna be honest with you you might see a
grown man cry because this is like my
hail mary to get out of this i'm looking
at the other team i don't see how we
lose this i don't yes okay
this is so far so good
you get pilled in this
capacity you go back to the front
i'm going to do buy
i'm going to do sell
we're going to buy and then get the
trigger combine
next turn you're going to start scaling
which is going to be sick
i don't think you do it yet i think you
just buy
thank you so much for the hp
and if we're going to well if we're
going to do it that way we don't really
need you to be honest so we're not even
gonna freeze you because you're gonna
level up here this would be another one
where like it's pretty pivotal that i
don't die
or don't lose
this squad
is not that spooky but i guess like the
beaver and and a lot of melon armor is
always a little bit spicy but it's not
enough okay pass the mystic hope you're
doing well thanks for the support of the
channel over the years always and this
sounds like i'm i'm being like a sore
winner i don't mean it this way it's
always this is like the only game i've
ever played in my life where i feel like
i run into names that i recognize all
the time
and that's it you know it's very nice
quite frankly it's very nice
i think we can do like a super hard
pivot as good as the the hatching chick
is for us and it's kind of incredible
we can do like a a buy me sell me type
meta here because we we got a great sort
of synergy going on
you're gonna be an eight nine no you're
gonna be a 13 10. let's this is a squad
man
level two dog's gonna help us out the
same rules apply i will cry if we lose
this one i won't cry if we lose around
eight okay
this doesn't seem that bad
it seems totally fine
the average risk enjoyer
okay
this is not the right build for a poodle
i think um so you get sold i'd love to
rip i'd love to sell you and then buy
you back every round i understand it's
economically not the the best option
alas
um i'll take it four two two four uh i
mean a poodle is probably the best thing
to buy
i mean we're gonna get a um
just hear me out right we're gonna get
garlic
i think we're gonna just buy anything
because we get so many triggers off of
it
sell i think you're gonna buy a poodle
and we would rather have our bison get
the buff
really the only buffs are for bison and
dog but at least like caterpillar
doesn't really get any value out of it
but at least there's you know we're
getting some stat gain out of holding
this so i don't mind
okay okay this is looking look it might
be the most common pay to win build you
ever see like caterpillar plus some form
of early scaling but i'll take it
[Laughter]
i'm not in a position to be making
enemies right now um you're gonna scale
nicely by yourself let's try to get the
bice it's a bit of a hail mary to do it
like this but let's try to get the bison
going a bit
you'll sell me back to seven
you'll buy me
um because the caterpillar inherits from
the dog i'm gonna feed the dog
at least for now then we're gonna sell
you
then we're gonna buy you because we get
a nice trigger out of it then we're
gonna sell you then we're gonna buy an
eagle and i guess like shove it down
there i guess this i mean it's a pretty
dirty squad is scaling nicely
we're not quite at like 350 50 levels
but
okay that's a classic uh little
anti-technology here i can't be upset i
still think we we kind of
i still think we lose is what i was
gonna say
it's a great snipe
okay so this is a sell me
i'll buy me
i i know we're on lethal we will get
more than five wins
i promise this to you
now i don't have anything really to back
that up
but it certainly feels nice to say
whether or not it's true like this this
squad in my opinion is too good to go
5'4
this is like
minimum seven eight
like seven wins eight losses
now i don't know in a in a duck in the
dodo in the dog into rooster world i
don't know if that still applies but i
do know what still applies horses lose
okay this is we have to do it like this
i loved having you around i hope to see
you again soon
but we will be sticking to the plan
love to see you you don't really fit yet
that's okay we'll find a way
this will take us
garlic on the bison would also be pretty
important
freeze me just in case roll me
okay
sell me
and then do the same sort of buy i think
we don't lose like this is a wide squad
we don't lose to a single scorpion i
think it's going to take like a dodo
rooster type situation now of course you
hate to see the scorpion we could also
lose to a squad that's just us but
stronger
i don't think that's what's happening
here you know we made it through that
didn't really break a sweat hard raid
monitor is not going off or anything
so get sold
do we care about getting a bison
stronger
i think because we get the extra
triggers out of it we might as well
otherwise if this was like our only
real anchor unit it might be too late we
definitely do not care about getting a
dog to the next level
we could fish for
chocolate for our buffalo
but i think
the possibility okay thank you by the
way i i feel like the possibility of
getting a scorpion or something is worth
more so freeze this for now
i'm gonna freeze you
we did not get a scorpion and now you
choose
call me crazy for this one
i think we're gonna try this
without melon armor i don't want to buff
our dog maybe buffing like our middle
unit you don't see too many middle
scorpions it's been known to happen
hmm this is a strange team
i don't mean in a negative way ultra
newbie but like once that once that
sheep dies it's over it doesn't come
back as a 50.
no disrespect by the way
intended at least now we could but it's
a little late for that pivot
hard for me to not just take the easy
way out there
i don't even think we need chocolate i
think this is i think this is the squad
right here that bison is getting six six
per turn is actually now probably
stronger hold this this looks okay man
nothing wrong with is that nine i told
you to have faith at five people were
probably they were sounding the alarm
bells
you got nothing to worry about this
squad is like this is tried tested and
true like the old chevrolet commercials
love it
bison or sorry buffalo is very confusing
when i have both is probably the most in
need of a buff
you know what we're looking for
one scorpion just hits the spot then we
go for a read
a mango style hard read
no no no no no no
you peace
i think
believe it or not you buy a bat
and i think you roll bad at the front
for anti-scorpion technology
and we hope that the bat hits melon
armor
it hit i don't know i think it did chili
pepper
the turkey freaking but it's not there's
no fly
there's no fly
this is a no-fly zone that's 10 wins
okay
look i'm not necessarily proud of the
creativity of the squad i don't think
that we
made any big innovations today
i love how the the buffalo looks like
he's got bangs
it's that's hilarious to me anyway i i
think we we basically just did what we
had to do to win today
i'll take it it still feels nice to get
10 wins

you're gonna ask if you're on youtube
you're gonna be like hey
why does he sound different i'm just
going through puberty again don't worry
about it
i'm on work from home right now as a
result of a little tickle in my throat
i thought
how fun could it be if we do some
achievement hunting like for example
you get a sticker for every animal
you've upgraded to level three
and a second one
for winning as well
so there are many animals
that we have not gotten to level three
there are also many animals that we've
never won with
dragon
come on this doesn't even make sense
we've never gotten dragon to level three
or one with a dragon that's not even
right that doesn't even make sense
am i missing some
it has to be a level three when you win
with it
that [ __ ] is impossible
how are you supposed to how are you
supposed to do where's my horse
where's horse is this in alphabetical
order
am i stupid yes there it is we have one
horse okay i don't know dude let's try
it okay
it's easy to achievement hunt if you
roll ducks look here's
my treat is on duck meta okay
i have no problem and like in versus
whatever like that's the optimal line in
arena for me personally i don't really
care what you do because you only play
people like you know one to two times
each
i don't want to just roll
and then you know
throw my first three runs just to get
five ducks if i get ducks i will buy
ducks and use the ducks to level up
but i'm not gonna just meta the ducks
because i just i i think that you run
the risk of like ruining your enjoyment
of the arena side of the game hey
black truffler thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you so level ones
i'm trying to think i'm not i'm not
worried too much on about like our tier
one animals
like i know there's a
a lot of animals that you know
especially around tier four five six
we've never won with so i think i'd i
probably would just like let's just
chill here maybe i've never gotten that
far with a cricket keep in mind by the
way as we play as the salty seeds you
actually have to get to uh 10 wins so
like you you know you can't just be like
it's not just about unit selection you
gotta like win as well
okay we draw those hold on casino i i
didn't even
i didn't even remember casino
will nl
get to six wins or more there you go
gotta miss the casino it's back it's
back end in pog form okay give me one of
those uh
give me one of those roll me duck
no duck me
that's fine we will take an ant
level three gives you the sticker
winning gives you the ribbon okay great
great intel thank you
freeze me
i don't mind this one duck
what the heck is this
we're playing against chris martin of
coldplay
my musical idol
father to apple paltrow
okay
take me up a level
a jeep
you think we've ever won with a level
three shrimp
i really doubt it
i think there's basically a zero percent
chance
you know what
we're going scampi
this is now non-negotiable scampi will
stick around
don't feed this the ducks gotta go first
sell the duck
don't sell the crickets yet you don't
have to
try to get a level three ant just
because it's useful
i think you could add us well useful if
you get like a bison or something dude
honestly be mad don't care
a dog is it works very well with scampi
well you know what keep it frozen for
now you are a 3-3 second shrimp very
important okay this would be a great
round to draw
this would be a great round to draw
wow dodo
duck pretty unusual build there where'd
you get that idea
uh everybody on earth you peace please
give me six hp not that it matters now
that i look at it
okay
any sellers in the chat right now
sell me
let's go
buy me
sell me omg me that's what i like to
hear look at him me him me okay
buy me
yummy
pill me
i don't really want to eat our ant it's
our only unit that has stats
so sell me yummy
we do want to go up a level
i think it has to be like this
um
i think we're going to lose this next
round but just give me a second here i
think you buy
sell
buy
i'm not
look
310 is kind of impressive
ah there's no way we the best we could
do is draw but even that's not gonna
happen against this ox i think you know
what actually holy crap somehow
ugly shrimp build actually made it
now
now we got it okay hold on
you need garlic that's just a given give
me combines
holy birch
somehow shrimp scampi has returned so
true so true
we need to keep some space available i
think you can do this
you get the buy purchase regardless you
get
the dog
did i say dog i meant garlic we we gotta
get a rooster
i don't know how we buff the rooster but
you got to get the rooster going here at
some point
um
let's just send it it's so early
3 13 like what is wrong with you
we're gonna create the stone cold steve
austin dog
uh oh
i don't know if i trust the salad right
now
uh oh
i can hear the baby she's going uh-oh
we got a seafood boil going on today
okay
okay
that's uh that's pretty lucky
please please
no wait we win these
okay somehow this is actually happening
we don't want to keep the bunny going
though that's that's not our game plan
um
yeah we have turned our dog into a crab
somehow
i think this is a straight-up role
uh you can definitely like okay don't be
mad
sell me
buy me
you're gonna be mad by the way
this rooster is nothing
until the rooster
gets buffed it's an easy sell target
because it's just a 3-3 we can buy one
back for three gold so getting three hp
out of it is kinda sick
i would love it if you got like an
attack
if at any moment you decided that like
an attack was worthwhile
i would i would be over the moon right
now
okay um
look
attack
i'm dying
what about a you could add a crab into
this you could do seafood boil again i
don't know think about it we already
we're three wins somehow
nevertheless we persisted
okay not sweating this that much thank
you
dude we're getting so lucky
are you seeing this
like somehow this dog is doing it
briefly for a brief moment they were
420.
this ant is is goaded absolutely true so
true that's true
for now i think our end game here is
well like our end game for the moment is
we're gonna put a crab in here but i
like our cycle right now
you just gotta buy things that give you
a benefit when you sell them
everyone chill
i'm thinking
i know you can buy a rooster
and then pill it and then you'll get the
summon trigger then you can sell the
thing back
yeah that's probably the best play and
then we're keeping the whole shop frozen
get rid of the badger the crap when we
have money for crab and meat the the
crab is basically going to become a
second dog this is a little spicy it's a
little freaky nasty this this i can't
see how this could possibly be a win
the dog is too strong the kangaroo's
even stronger
taking badgers again excuse me did you
see my my front badger 10 win last night
it was it's a new era
okay get pills
okay good very good thank you really
appreciate it a little more hp 629.
honestly i think you need meat more than
you need garlic right now
roll me
very important
and then with six remaining gold
this is also very nice that's so early
this thing's gonna freaking slap man
this thing's gonna freaking slap
but i think it's so early this gets hit
by a lot of deer and i don't appreciate
that
there we
go let's just keep that available for
the time
here we go here we go
scorpion honestly i gotta admit would
have been kind of sick here
but i i feel like pretty good honestly
i don't see how we lose this one
silly baby great name okay keep in mind
we still gotta try to get scampi to
level three which we're two away from
right now
but i think you can totally at this
point you could combine
monkeys is very nice
i don't mind having you i don't mind
keeping you frozen for a minute
honestly the whole game plan is like
getting scampi to level three so
you might as well
we can almost parrot chain but
not quite just because of the crabs
attack so for now
i know we're buffing the ants i mean
like you're
you're a silly baby yourself if you feel
like this ant is going anywhere right
now it's 7-eleven
does parrot scorpion work
uh i can't imagine that it doesn't i
think i think it's got
it don't don't what my monkey whatever
my monkey
you ever hear the expression everybody's
got something to hide except for me and
my monkey
there we go we owned you oh scorpion has
equipment it has no ability
that's that's good intel
thank you
all right remember i said the ant was
not going anywhere
life comes at you fast
that's fine man that's fine
you're level two give me a buy sell
please attack you need i mean like i'm
not that upset but like you need some
attack
it's getting a little ridiculous
we're not on lethal our best long-term
play
no come on it's this
no way
is this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
you don't have the crab steal the hp
from the scorpion again
we did that two days ago
okay
dude honestly
i'm we we already have paid out the
believers
on this weird crab build
i do have to say as much as i've
complained about the uh like the hp
distribution versus the damage it is not
that bad
now if we're gonna do a buy sell build i
think you gotta get a dragon out there
i think you gotta buy roll
i'm not gonna complain yet
i'm not gonna complain yet
any complainers
in the chat or just me hold on
by me
level three scampi so you're saying
there's a chance please it's worth the
sell
now it's not worth the sell at all but
um okay
level three scampi
there's a chance
you peace you peace
okay
not this one
we're on lethal
we're on six wins
level ones please thank
you goodbye
this would be a little miraculous but
just give it a give it a second stop
feeding the crab oh my god
look
i re i just wanted to see chocolate man
can you blame me
a second scampi
and now we get the dream shop i i needed
chocolate
to get the dragon to level two please
please just let no there's no chance
ha
dodo rooster i got donald rooster
good one anyway we pay all the believers
regardless
this game is so fun you gotta try it one
of the most fun things you can do is
just run dodo rooster like literally
every single game
with the turkey behind it
okay so we still we got an achievement
right because we got the level three
okay let me let me see make it seven
wins honestly just shut up
we ran a level three shrimp if that's
not enough of like a bearish
uh indicator for you like i don't know
just stop betting doubt start betting
belief it's more fun
57
we're shrimp shrimp shrimp we were 57
before now we're 58. okay you still need
the win there so the rat rabbit we've
never had a level three rabbit
holy crap
i bet we've never had a level three
beaver either you've never had a level
three puppy how does that happen man
there's no way
we've ever had a level three pig
level 3b
you know what
i like the cut of your pants
we'll be the panicking fireman
how the heck how the heck do you get a b
to scale
i guess you just
add it to things pill them and then then
add them together
hatching chick oh we're on paid where
i'm free to play though
you add honey on a bee no no no no
no no no no no start me
roll me
buy me buy me
buy me i guess
very similar squad i can't help but
notice the the one amazing thing about
duck meta is that it it genuinely does
mean that the early game is not like a
cutthroat world
anymore i'm thinking okay
um
i'm thinking
you gotta pill no because i don't want
any of these animals to stick around
i'm gonna end up rolling like a peacock
for a second
though i hate to admit it
it's gonna be a sell sell
you're gonna buy a peacock
pill the ant
and then buff it
with the beaver
it hit itself but that's okay
all right all right so now we got a one
two b
now
you buy an otter and hope it buffs the
bee
that's that's better for our overall
chances
you buy maybe you don't buy a duck
because it's kind of expensive even
though it would give us a benefit on so
i think you roll once
you buy an ant
and then put a b on the ant
so that at least you're getting a
benefit twice out of the pill
it was three four though
that's the three four is never gonna get
us
to a level three b we gotta we gotta
swing for the freaking fences that's
true flamingo would have worked as well
flamingo would've worked probably better
actually
okay please
the one thing the one thing the weakness
couldn't hit anyway we're still gonna
win somehow
roll me no no this is very important we
need some
we need some efficacy
i can at least get some wins with this
possibly
this is very nice
it's a complicated world man i am
thinking of honeying the otter okay
but i'm also thinking of selling the
otter
and just putting the flamingo out there
so that we can honey it next turn and
trying to roll into a pill
did not roll into a pill that's fine we
got some more honey
[Laughter]
even if we don't win
to at least get to a level 3b would be
an interesting achievement to have
accomplished so i i would take that as a
big positive
okay some egg destroyer if you say so
why skip the ants
we're at a dearth of pills right now is
is more of our problem i'm realizing as
well we shouldn't have frozen
both of the honeys
we really need pills
i think we can go to a level two peacock
first
there's no way it's gonna fit
i just need some pills okay
we get some pills things are gonna go
here
i'm not scared of this build man like i
for some reason
we're like actually totally fine
every time i put you on his background
noise i end up getting up to watch a
little uh
a little super auto pets i mean what can
you say it's a it's a wonderful game
i appreciate the support thank you
now
you get pilled
combine me
you come out
you get some honey
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah cause this is another
great thing to pill
kill me
don't need you
although
we don't need garlic on anybody you need
meat you're gonna get melon
this is totally fine i definitely feel
though i'm like hold on
an aux seems like a great thing if we're
going to pill
many things
on this run regardless
i don't know i i mean we're going to
have some empty space in a second here
we probably won't be able to
to to get the first pill on it but
that's okay
mel in the b
honestly kind of humorous
a bit of a humorous play
i by the way we're at the believer
threshold already that's kind of
hilarious
sell peacock for ox you are insane
that is an insane
message that you have given to me you
know what though i'm a sick frick
pill this son of a gun right here
give mello and armor to this bee
guess what now he's level two
now you take your place in the line
roll me scorpion's nice but just wait it
out for a sec here
i i really need a pill more than
anything else
pill only costs one i'm not sweating it
next time next time
this is actually so funny
why is he trying for level 3b i don't
know i just thought it would be humorous
all right this is you know what we
actually do punch through that hippo i'm
not sweating it i'm not sweating i'm not
owned i'm not owned i'm not owned
i'm still not owned we're at seven wins
man
i need a pill
thank you thank you for the pill
then
yummy yummy
four five melon armor b
the only problem now is like there's
nothing for a turtle to do so we really
actually don't need you
no offense or whatever
we need to set it up like like this now
now we need a unit
like a like a unit that does something
by itself
skunk at level one i'm not i'm not sold
on
freeze the penguin
i think you do honey ant again
and then i mean we still have 10 lives
this would be a legendary run
then when we get into like a more
permanente situation that's where we're
gonna end up rolling the
the uh
the penguin
you peace you peace
uh uh oh you just got owned by a level
2b with melon armor
freeze me
pill
all i care for is pill
no no no not even necessary
not even necessary
it's not necessary
it doesn't matter
you peace
ten rolls
minus ten minus ten i didn't freeze
honey
by the way hello apollo i didn't freeze
honey because i thought like it's very
likely we're gonna get a chocolate bar
at some point by the way we win these
we're at nine wins we might not get a
level 3b because we might have a perfect
run
okay i mean this is
obvious
please
thank you oh
thank you
don't care didn't ask plus we got a
level 3b
i don't think we need i mean it's an
early snake i don't think we need it
though
dude this run is so good
imagine
this this run i think we lose this round
this that's some strong units
that's fine though we got some yeah oh
no it's mouth next time next time i
promise i won't run it next time source
dude just trust me
grog08 thank you for the gifted
subscriptions by the way thank you
roll me
honestly like it's so minor
but for three gold like straight i mean
we could honestly like get a bison in
here instead but like
i'm just gonna give our crab like plus
one attack
please get me there
this is really bad
we we lasted just long enough to run up
against the meta builds
like now this is where things become a
bit of a problem
um
12.
i honestly think
that what you want to see is like three
scorpions so like this is anti-scorpion
tech
maybe with a stake on it just for
technology
we've never had a level three crab
it does not help us win here
as much as i would
i know this is only level two but
oh then i'll get it by the penguin
you're absolutely right you mad geniuses
please please don't take this from me
ha ha dog dodo crab ha ha
very fun i like to play this game to
have fun as well that's why i run dog
dodo crab every game
hmm
well
we're basically just praying for a
miracle
at this point
that's miraculous okay
anti-scorpion
anti-big unit
rest of the squad
honestly
put your faith in the bee
holy crap holy crap
get red
get red
can you believe this we actually lost
because of that mammoth
while we were rolling a level 3b we were
this close
hello
penguins where's penguin
um
oh my god
that's what i've been saying exactly
wait there's no achievement for it no
there is an achievement for a bee you
you hate her you hate her look at that
we got it
okay let's run one more back i can't
believe we've never had a level three
puppy man that that's crazy
baby oh payout payout dude i can't we
almost had a perfect run
and then we didn't even get to ten wins
can you believe that
hello
where's apple
apple
she's going off man
that day
this is classic this is classic right
here
hmm how about the smooth citizens
is that even possible
that day
what do you think about a level 3b
it seems like the kind of run where we
could run a level 3b
be
okay this squad is just dirty full
insect build
we've already done shrimp scampi
okay bye bye
we've already got shrimp scampi
i definitely like this i definitely like
this
this is very important for when we get a
puppy going what she's gonna happen
right freaking now
i'm not freaking leaving
i'm not freaking leaving
okay
stall for one turn
i think selmy
you know what a 1-4 for a bit is not
that bad
run the 1-4 except you're not going to
get puppy scaling for one turn
make up for it by feeding the beetle
next turn
[Laughter]
uh we're gonna lose this one
though yeah
yeah yeah yeah okay fair enough
they're me but stronger
eat
nice scaling
you can go dude i gotta tell you i kind
of feel like i don't think this is that
impressive but i feel like a one-seven
ladybug it's kind of a one-seven peacock
that wasn't even close gets kind of
nasty with it protects our units at the
back for a little bit here
how old is your daughter she's almost
she's almost 14 months
so about a year and a sixth
had to throw in
a little bit there um
okay so obviously scaling is like
insanely important the peacock is not
gonna
uh
stick around long term
llama please for a four squad marty
you know what
[ __ ] it
why not
you need to level faster
i don't know this might be okay
you're gonna have what you're gonna
you're gonna get plus two you're gonna
plus two you're gonna get plus two
you're gonna get plus you're gonna get
plus two you're gonna get plus two why
don't you take one of these
freeze me
roll me um i don't know if i really want
to invest in you to be honest i feel
like you get replaced by a scorpion
or another caterpillar oh my god oh my
god oh my god
steal a buff
5 8 meat lama su
this would be an amazing round to
actually lose
i'm playing both sides so i always come
out on top
now we also need some garlic
we need to stay at two gold
okay
two gold or better i should say
you know what
we're not on lethal who cares
give it a try
i'm a full believer
now we're uh
dodo rooster uh last time i saw this
build i fell off my dinosaur
get owned get owned
stop reading the subreddit
sell me
yummy yummy honestly buy me sell me
you peace honestly can me
honestly buy me no we gotta stay on two
gold honestly roll me
huge
huge
huge huge huge
the bison is the perfect complement to
this squad
let's go we overrode the melon armor
okay somehow
we we really gotta not lose
like we
got don't want to say problems but like
we we lost too much early getting this
set up which is an issue now you're
getting plus two plus two you're getting
plus two plus two you're closer to
leveling up though equipment is insanely
important
dude our stats just like look good
nice try you peace
i think it's more important to scale
these units
yes
thank you
we can roll once
give me garlic
this is a tricky one
um
honestly
even though i want to replace it with
garlic i i trust that over
over a little salad
okay interesting skunk build counters my
caterpillar
two chicks at the same time this is
rough man
ah never mind it's totally fine get
owned
i can't believe we hit the believer
threshold so easily
okay that's this is a gimmie
feed the unit that's strongest
freeze the turtle in case we get a nice
pill in the shop at some point um
meow
it's kind of freaked though because like
we can't buy anything else
i don't really want to freeze two
turtles
i guess double melon armor is pretty
good but it's quite expensive
i guess we're just gonna roll for
doubles
i think a can does pretty well here i
can't believe we paid out the believers
as well hey monk predator04 thanks for
the gifted subscriptions
thank you
we're we're trying to bust open the meta
today this seems really bad
hold on we draw these we draw these
does a can do anything here
you know what you raise a good point
in hindsight you raise a good point
one up doesn't do anything for us
chocolate does something for us i really
want to see like the vice i mean they're
all doing the same thing but the llama
is the one we were trying to get to like
level three it's a bit of a pipe dream
bro i'm just i'm just begging you
level three puppy was the goal
i don't know turns out i don't know what
the hell i'm talking about
yeah you can't feed uh
you can't feed uh chocolate to a puppy
anyway
ever tell you about the time i house it
for well i can't sit
cat sat cat sitted for a friend in
vancouver when he went on uh vacation
like second day
like we i was coming back from like a
thing that where i was away from the
city and he was leaving the city so
there was like one day where the cat was
unsupervised in his apartment
day two like 26 hour it's not corey i
swear
corey is a great cat owner day two i
come to his apartment i open up the door
first off their windows are wide open so
at any point the cat could have just
jumped out of the
uh
the house and left uh and the also i
walk into the living room
and there's literally like a half eaten
candy bar on the carpet which is first
off like what are you doing
that's just kind of disgusting and then
secondly chocolate is like insanely
toxic to cats and dogs it's literally
like he tried to frame me for cat murder
luckily the cat was too smart for that
anyway
i can't believe we're still we're still
pumping here honestly we got to get you
buffed
i was annoyed too because it was one of
those things where like the cat we need
to freeze that we need to freeze this
when i mean this is understandable for
cats right but like
the cat was like running away from me
and i was like buddy i'm trying to like
save your life right here just relax

lucked out with a cat sitter like i'm i
got your best interest at heart

fall guys is doing a collaboration with
uh radiohead honestly don't add me
that's kind of sick
there's a joke in there somewhere
how do i feel about it
optimistic that's a song from kid a
okay we lose these we lose these i
accept that we lose these no problem
okay we combine
easy caterpillar one of the easiest
caterpillars of my adult life
roll
i see another fish i'm a sick
something i see a sick something okay
okay okay him him me him me and me
send it
okay that that hedgehog is going to do
some nasty work to our birds but like
big whoop
your mother big son of a
okay hold on hold on everybody chill
we gotta dump these birds at some point
man
they're not doing it for us
i'm gonna give you one of these okay
we win these
we draw these come on man move
caterpillar to the back why would i want
my caterpillar to steal these buffs
now we don't even have to do anything
like this is just the game now
like we could literally just click like
move ahead on every single
uh turn here holy crap
this actually seems like a 10-win squad
maybe i'm a little bullish
i actually saw the bisons too which is
kind of crazy to me that's that's
atypical
two more turns for this to pop holy
brush holy what the heck is even that i
could probably think about pilling an
ant in our future
oh wait we already have a level three
because of the fish
because of the fish
you genius i love this i love this i
can't be mad
i don't really know what's happening
but i love it
all right we still win i love that i
love that team
i mean this i don't even know what to
say right now i think we should just
maybe feed you don't worry about pilling
an ant we'll just sell it later instead
why don't you get going might as well
get at the back next thing we'll be
looking for is a turtle what are you
buffing lay buffing a caterpillar for no
reason
damn speed run strats
i love seeing a 3-3 rooster
it feels so good watching it watching it
die
okay what are we at here four wins okay
real voice reveal real voice reveal
confirmed garlic armor is going to do
some great work here i do not see a
turtle er go i roll ergo i roll you know
what there's like
why not i bet we've never had a level
three bluebird
we need a turtle we'll sell the ant for
the turtle roll the turtle behind the
caterpillar
or in front of the caterpillar i mean
uh my squad is literally you but
stronger
i doubt it like a damn fool
excuse me that's blue bossy it's true
true that's true true
um get sold
get bought
i see no blue bossy you know what you
know what i don't know
chilly [ __ ] chili bird
no in this situation you don't want to
chill uh excuse me you don't want to
kill your turtle for melon armor you
want the melon armor to pass to your
butterfly
it's endgame strats
bird chilling
birds eye chili it's perfect
no no no no no no no
you know what i was wrong do it like
that blue bossy i love keeping this
thing frozen
can you believe it a level three blue
bazi and the believers have won
skipped a bison son of a
what a name shadow jerker
i'm not even mad this is incredible i
mean what can you say about this we did
we get a little bit of luck in the
process it's been suggested
seven wins
honestly we can try
unfreeze me i'm going for that bison
i don't know like if i've ever felt this
far ahead of the curve
like we have all of all of our units
have well both of our good units have
melon armor and turn 12. i'm actually
worried we might have done things like a
little too far ahead of the curve
like we have a 50 37 with melon armor
just chilling at the back for no reason
so please
one more
i don't see him i don't see him
um
i mean this fish is not going anywhere
but
chocolate are we on we're on eight right
we're on round eight
canadian bacon 1867. for those of you
not in the know 1867 is the year of my
country's confederation this is uh the
this is a great uh country respecter the
country respector has logged
that on said maybe you should uh learn
to respect some builds that don't get
their asses beat
no disrespect intended or whatever but
like come on
honestly kind of insulting here
um
so i don't want to win this run
because i need to get a bison
or chocolate
that's not a bison
that's not a bison
it's not a bison
it's not a bison
it's not a bison
it's a bison okay
your days are
over please please please
31 hp we have a gamer officially there's
a gamer here
yo what the what the heck happened to my
butterfly
oh well
nice try
all right ten wins two achievements
sometimes you just like not gotta think
about it too much
oh baby
four level threes and a level one turtle
put that in your versus pipe and smoke
it
anyway



auto pets doing some some meme builds
but our meme builds have actually been
working out well for us
we're trying to get level threes of all
the things we've never seen before and
also winning so let's find some ones
that are like not too hard like lev
early things should be possible for
example level three rat
level three tropical fish level three
rabbit those should be very doable as
long as we're on pay to win
i don't know if the rat shows up and pay
to win but
keep in mind
for all of the uh
for all of the negativity surrounding
this that we are rolling a quote on
quote meme build um
we did it's been a believer's paradise
so far which reminds me as i play as the
sticky soup
i gotta um
i i gotta start a prediction
i gotta start a prediction
will nl get to six wins or more how long
is this at a typo will nl gets to six
wins or more
how long has that been typoed
level three snail kind of pog always has
okay i get it
do straight up
i don't mind this team
i would love to see a level three rabbit
i'm trying to think of what else level 3
tropical fish maybe level 3 snail
that's not even a joke it literally
always has been
i believe that
okay we lose these no sweat no sweat
okay i'm so you're telling me we have
had a level three dromedary
in our lives we've had a level three
dromedary that seems surprising to me
we've never had a level three tropical
fish okay so this is how it starts then
we buy one of these we get ready to sell
you and replace it with a stronger
animal
honestly like
literally everything here is better um
freeze this just for the time being pop
a spider down there instead pop a spider
now i'm sweating
i did for a while i did use dromedary
meta
so i'm i guess i'm not surprised that
maybe i've seen a level three
this is not necessarily big spider it's
just bigger than it used to be
you could definitely be like you know
what get out of my face your big
disgrace
don't mind place a swan buy one of these
straight up for the time being
i'm like chili's she's like eh pop one
of those down real quick
nice little buff on our swan now we got
a little bit of an engine
love the way that worked i don't know
how we're gonna kill this peacock
perhaps we simply will not yeah that
seems most likely
okay fair enough
seven life though seven life this could
still happen
shhh
i feel like if you're going to run it
like a pseudo scaling build you kind of
need to have a caterpillar as like a as
a pop-off
and then really like you should have
some meat maybe
you know what let's get two birds stoned
at once
level three snail and level three
tropical fish incoming copium because we
haven't seen a single um
duplicate of them yet so far 832 is not
enough it's not enough
it don't matter
your owns i'm owns i'm owns okay this is
bad man this is bad
but we're not lethal yet
holy crap
actually this is awesome
we can do this we this is now this is a
good squad
i should have went all in well we don't
have to as long as we get the six wins
you're okay and that's like
plausible
like look at this this is no problem
holy crap we drew are you kidding me
big snail no we don't even want a snail
now caterpillar's starting to pop good
stuff
roll me
tropical fish level two very nice
i literally nothing on the squad can
afford to be sold i'm actually just
gonna give you some garlic
as much as i'd love to get a cow to fit
in here everything on the squad is
necessary
freeze this
you know what might help
i mean this is a little spooky man
there was a snail there i didn't i went
snail blind because i
i drew the last round
here we go this is the start this is the
start
pay attention
i'm actually gonna feed you one that's
so stupid literally garlic for one round
have you lost your mind
not not a smart play unless it wins us
the round
confirmed that is absolutely not gonna
happen
but hold on we chunked it we still win
these
somehow we made it three wins two lives
left
one star snail better than bison
confirmed um we're looking to get some
achievements here okay so i'm not gonna
go for the snail yet i'm gonna feed the
tropical fish because it's closer
closer to level three that is
i guess we'll freeze you we already we
if you weren't here earlier
we did get a bird
to uh level three already
so that is uh
that's already been accomplished we also
got 10 wins on it i think
json i think we lose this one
maybe maybe not i don't know it's an
early turkey that's not that scary
no we definitely win this one i was just
sandbagging
let's go
okay so now we got a level three fish
that's new to us
you know might as well
you know what
stop drilling you hit oil
this is not a strong team just to be
clear
um we i think we've gotten pretty lucky
we haven't gone up against teams that
were too strong
holy crap we draw i'll take it i'll take
it
we're basically rooting for a miracle
freeze me
by me and then imagine the scaling we're
gonna get if we lose this next round and
buy the snail
and then we can dump it no because we
got to keep it to try to win okay fair
enough fair enough i guess we should buy
a beetle
huh okay
this would be a kind of a funny round to
lose
level two rooster
okay i mean not all roosters are like
bad necessarily
like evil
holy crap we draw these
keep that snail man
keep that snail
we don't need to buy it yet give me give
me some freaking salads
we got room to play with
we only need six more wins
i'm doing this for the believers man
i wouldn't expect you to understand
okay very funny
i like the part where you like killed
your own team
ah what the heck
we win these
that's five wins
roll me
i don't know what the heck we're looking
for now i guess we'll give the snail a
little steak
might as well freeze the sushi
freeze a bird
freeze a pear sure
i mean this is the alpha snail
there was a beetle in there
i don't need a beetle they're bad or
something um
i
we
we lose these okay this is good though
this is good
the snail she told you not to worry
about
that wasn't that impressive at all it's
actually like extremely disappointing
considering the the insane investment
required
aoe plus six plus three is red yeah but
you gotta buy like 50 snails to make it
work
it's crazy talk
please please please
i don't want to die i don't want to do
we are believers
okay believers
we got there with the with a level three
snail actually like our whole squad
basically is level three that'd be a fun
little challenge wouldn't it
get something like that going i guess oh
yeah just double roll me for no reason
give me one of those
roll me okay
for the love of god sell the snail i
need to try to get the stamp that you
get
for
winning the game
with the level 3 unit in your possession
dude we're getting the seven let me tell
you we're getting the seven
you're right tropical fish could use a
steak that's that's a buy okay yeah i
like that
honestly i think we're
pretty close to the point where like
maybe like our bird could take a steak
it doesn't i don't know i'm just giving
plus three attack
we need melon
melon beetle
melon beetle beetle
we have a full level three squad i
didn't think such a thing could even
happen oh you skunked me
genius play with the skunk i can't help
but feel like you might be a little bit
ashamed of your words and your deeds if
you'd known that your like meta dodo
rooster skunk team was gonna go up
against a level three bird level three
tropical fish level three snail and
level three ladybug but
what the heck
getting
doorbell running like crazy by the
amazon guy
the number one uh
prank for amazon deliveries is ringing
your doorbell like 50 times like you
immediately have to come to the door and
then when you open it they're already
like 10 steps away like looking at their
cell phone
all that just to get me to shout thank
you when you're like walking down the
street
i get you're busy i'm just saying
do you get paid by the number of rings
anyway anyway anyway anyway um
hold on first off choose prediction
we did get the six wins
where we add on achievements here
62
let's find some more early ones
crab is early you could definitely
we could think about maybe like a crab
i think crab rabbit or crab rat so put
me back on free to play
crab rabbit or crab rat crab it crap
i can remember that and then run the
casino back
dude i can't believe the the doubters
have not been paid out a single time
today despite the fact that we're
running meme builds
this is a good start
we're looking for rats and crabs
sure
rats and crabs
be the clumsy sailors
no roll challenge we're doing our own
meme challenge to start with okay
blood buds
we gotta i'm not just gonna steal his
content
you gotta you gotta wait like six days
and then you do the yoinkin twist i
learned it from the best
okay give me one of those give me one of
those unfreeze me
roll me
you're a piece
garbage
you know what
that's the damn squad
stanz did it first dude i actually feel
so bad for stans
like not really i'm sure he's over it
but like that
he lost to duck meta in the uh
in the invitational
to somebody not not to be rude at all
but somebody that didn't really know
what they were doing with the ducks but
got the dream built
is actually is it's a little sad
i'm not saying they didn't deserve the
win when they beat stanz i'm just saying
stans went in like fully prepared and
then like somebody sank a half court
three-pointer at the buzzer to beat him
now this is not amazing
what are we looking for crabs
okay you know what mouth
life is like a
hurricane hearing
no
duck bird i need i need to keep the one
space i'm not i'm not buying it tickle
mine
we don't need to freeze both we could
it's tough hold on we we've only got
five minutes left
freeze both we'll get a level up next
time and turn no
i want to win this one
race cars lasers airplanes it's a
duck something oh my god
[Laughter]
chandler
i would really like
to get a crab
[ __ ] it
six eight turtle
you're not gonna give me a crab so what
what are we the rats and rabbits rats
and rabbits
that's big
that's big
oh now it feels good now if you i don't
know what we're doing on this run just
trying to recover some help for the
believers i guess
honestly like you fit so nicely in here
why don't we just level you now i'm just
gonna be honest with you now i'm
basically just playing the game
okay
we're gonna get that crab out there
don't worry about that we're gonna get
that crab out there
hello
hello
hey
oh no
sad baby
yeah
that's the thing
hello
did you see what happened here
my turtles spat out a swan
okay
so let's let's play this tape by tape
okay the turtle comes out
it kills the deer bus comes out
kill the rat the rat
summoned a rat that pushed the swan
forward so the kangaroo got the melon
armor okay that was what happened there
that was i i think it was a bug but it's
very funny
we got the exact thing we asked for here
i think we got to combine and then try
to build the squad we wanted
we got it we got to get something like
this going
even though it's definitely terrible
like this is not a good team composition
so let's freeze one of those just in
case
but pointing right at me
what is she
oh she's pointing right at me i missed
my mr red
what the heck
is this allowed dude this is a great
time to have garlic armor let me tell
you
okay
fun build
rabbit is necessary you know what i love
a tortle here although
although it's a little weird because we
do want the crab to have meat there's
nothing wrong with leveling you imo okay
we have to say no to something i'm gonna
say no to our
rat sorry rat
i'm okay with you having this for now
buy me
hit me
hit me
sell me
buy me
roll me
straight up
straight up i'm like i'm talking serious
here i'm talking serious
give me two hp
i'm like chili's she's like
this turtle's kind of running with it
right now
do we at least trade
we do better than trade we do better
than trade look at this
i'm keeping you okay
go ahead go go get a little further
ahead i don't mind don't talk to me
can't really fit a monkey with this
build
i don't know if i would do this
big total you know what
literally one person in chat said it
let's run big tortell
please keep in mind if you're just
joining us we are not trying to win
necessarily we're trying to win with
level threes we've never seen before b
gets overridden we did it only to
provide two hp via two rabbits to our
units do not fear
it was a calculated gamble
nice try nice try nice dodo honestly
every time i beat a dodo it puts
positive energy out into the world
you know i bet i've never had a seal go
off man
we have to try it
there's no way we've ever gotten a level
we probably have never even gotten like
a level two seal
you know what no we can't fit you okay
okay
hey honey
okay
a rooster in a vacuum i don't mind too
much
we're gonna lose this this is and and i
gotta just respect it like this is just
a cool squad
blind to the crab my mistake my mistake
maybe we sell the crab and just run a
seal build instead
hello goodbye crab i'm i'm making an
executive decision here
hello
it's kind of an incredible shop
level three snail oh we did it last game
like i know that sounds like i'm being
smarmy but like legitimately
if you weren't here we we just did it we
didn't win though so there's a chance
for it to
to have some like redemption in the
future
no joke this squad is actually like kind
of
this squad is actually kind of cracked
but we could die here
don't don't we i will be done like so
shortly
i will be out as soon as this run is is
completed see you in a second honey bye
bye
that's my headphone cord and it's okay i
can i can just keep that under the desk
thank you thank you
now
give me the turtle
we got to believer meta which is a
little surprising to me
sell me
buy me
seal me
i we could have had a level three cow by
now probably but
i'm realizing now we've also had a
doubterless day which is a wonderful
thing to experience
for now give me one of these give me
give me a snake
behind you freeze
freeze the pizza maybe what it's nice to
keep it around as a flexible option
we're gonna start running into some meme
builds this is not neces or not me meta
builds this is not necessarily a meta
built
holy crap we draw that thank you thank
you
it would be better for me start here
start here
do you believe
two in five odds
you motto
seal can have garlic that's fine
we do need the bunny but just everybody
just relax no it doesn't eat garlic
although it would still give two random
friends two too
if we did like
this
no no hold on hold on
melon it's late enough for melon
give me the buffs
then put the seal up at the front
and then the snake behind the rooster i
e this earth behind the goose no behind
the
like that
don't ask questions just send it
please
not bad
fly you peace that's all right turtle
garlic is gonna roast your freaking fly
build well there's a turkey so there's a
little
there's there's some monka involved
melon armor is gonna get a little no
it's not gonna get torched
get owned
nice turkey fly
another another instance of us putting
positive energy out into the world
we need to try to get you to level three
but it's it's it's mighty tight
chocolate
i guess we should freeze a rabbit for a
second we're like right on the razor's
edge here
it's like it's so the the run is so
tight i do i see 250 50s that's a little
frightening
i don't see how we make it through this
one
okay
fair enough either way
at least we know it no achievements
unlocked
but hey
we pay out the the believers yet again



hey everybody welcome back super auto
pets let's go back to free to play
um
we're gonna you know what
it can't be done this is how much i'm a
believer in horses not being worthwhile
i legitimately think even with two
horses in the shop you can't roll it
i i for real think it's that bad let's
be the the helpless bosses ooh
helpless fangirls foamy fangirls foamy
feet helpless feet blading bosses
there's a lot of there's a lot of good
ones here it'll be the helpless bosses
though um
we're gonna do a little quicker today
because i'm i'm on a bit of a time
crunch but you you you already know the
video length please don't spoil it for
me
i
i don't want to be spoiled on how things
are going to go here
very nice um
i don't have like a meta
for what we're going to do here
i think we should try to freeze this
maybe a better chance of getting to
level two and making that duck slightly
more worthwhile um i don't have a meta
or anything like that i'm not trying to
force anything for the time being
already ran some like um some cheeky
achievement style
builds earlier today so whatever happens
happens we're just going to try to roll
you know the best animals available
okay i think the wrong thing to do
is invest in your ants i think you pill
your ant don't hit a duck please thank
you so much that's much better um
i actually for sure
think you can
sell a duck
if you had more ducks weirdly enough
this would probably be less likely to be
good
but i totally think you can sell a duck
in order to
buff a rat
i don't love this
this shop
i don't
i think we might be better off with
something like that i i think the rat is
not that good but i think if we're
willing to you know buy in when it comes
out use it until its efficacy is like
zero
then i think it's okay
genuinely it will appear to lose us some
rounds but it it's like deceptive i
think it's deceptive the same way like
the honey badger's deceptive i i guess
we're going to go up a level on it
mostly just for stats
i think it's one of those things
where like um
you only notice what the rad is doing
when it does something bad i.e
you know you
were gonna win but then you lost because
there was a 1-1 dirty rat on the other
team
what you don't see is that if you didn't
have the 7-8 rat
standing up there in the first place you
never would have even gotten that far
you know you you would have died you
know on your third unit or something but
i don't think it's amazing but i think
it's okay to stick with for a second
here that's why we did that
do me a favor do this do this see what
you get
penguin it's very interesting
a penguin very interesting you know what
let's buy one we're getting two buffs
soon to be three buffs
we're really looking for garlic in our
future dare i suggest that we might be
looking at one of the strangest squads
of all time like we're kind of already
built for scaling
with the penguin and then units that are
like pretty static not a stretch to
think we could get a level two kangaroo
and maybe even like a level two penguin
or something and start
just chunking like this looks good so
far then we buff don't hit the penguin
that's fine you look i like a bison
it's gonna take us a bit to get there
i'm not upset with it but it's gonna
take us a bit to get there um
you're already doing great work i think
we'd be best maybe with some garlic on
the kangaroo we could modify it later if
we have to put some garlic on the rat
but the meat has done as a service up to
this point
okay this is a very similar looking
squad here i can't help but notice
quite unfortunately they they honestly
there's equipment difference they had
that squad's going places
they got a good set up
no disrespect
roll me
very nice so that puts you in penguin
range
what the heck are we looking
for um
sure i do think
you could probably dump an otter at this
point it's not at five seven it's
scaling is a little underwhelming
get the snail
honestly like throw a monkey out there
we got a kangaroo coming in um like to
give us a little buff we got our rat
getting even stronger
i don't know
meat and garlic i i've always been a
garlic guy
but i do feel like meat and garlic are
closer than i originally gave them
credit for so to replace meat with
garlic just as enemies are getting
tankier
doesn't necessarily appeal to me but
but we're thinking
so i i like it
i like it roll me
the problem is our fish is not going to
stick around long term we need probably
even though we're getting buffs out of
it we really maybe if we get another
level of penguin i would consider it but
i'm i'm gonna do it i'm gonna i'm gonna
buy the garlic
i think it tends to be a little bit more
consistent but the meat is um i mean
it's also very good
the garlic actually saved us uh you know
quite the problem there i think
i can't believe how well this squad's
working there is a caveat it's gonna
fall off like right now
it's gonna fall off real quick
um
if i dumped you
and got a
scorpion i think that would be fine
if i dumped you and i got two scorpions
i think that would be fine i'm gonna buy
a can
anytime we don't know
what we're doing
um and the can exists
i like to purchase a can
i don't mind a scorpion getting buffed
um and it
is especially when you have a lot of hp
and we do have a decent amount to play
with here
i think that's that's a good time to
roll a cam that's very unfortunate for
us for sure um we will definitely lose
this one
and now we're on lethal so all that hp
we had to play with is now following by
the wayside in a big way
can me i'm going in man can me can me
by me
and then this is just pray this is a
moment where you just engage in prayer
this looks okay honestly this looks fine
i think i'm not saying the prayer did it
but i i think that it certainly could
have been uh it could have been worse
garlic absolutely just
feasts on flies
any summon build dies to this is why
like i i another reason i think summon
builds suck is because like some builds
need a counter
right like you know if someone's rolling
like a big unit at the front and trash
behind it that just serves to scale the
big unit they die to scorpions so
there's like a counter pick
the summon build dies to garlic most of
the time at least in the mid game
you know once you get a turkey and a
tiger maybe not so much but you know
like garlic is everywhere
i think you can sell a penguin and roll
tiger behind level three kangaroo
it's it's good it's spicy but it's good
and i'm gonna be straight up with you
please don't kill me here i'm now i am
achievement hunting
we're at seven wins our chances of
winning overall i think are you know not
amazing
um
but we could if we win to win with a
level three rat
would really hit the spot that would be
an achievement unlocked
and
one that is tough to get so i would be
pleased
there's our level three rat now we got
to figure out a way to finagle two more
wins out of this
i really don't have an answer for you um
a stake can help
but i think it tends to be overstated
instead i will just roll
um and do nothing if that's okay with
you
much better uh and then i will buy like
uh um on an apple
and buff our 12 12 scorpion and then we
just hope that we get an opponent that
doesn't really have anything going on
i don't think that's the case here but i
do also think even in spite of that
damage there the the tiger and garlic
munching is like it's done some amazing
work for us here here or the tiger in
kangaroo i should say
but even then i i have to be like
straight up with you
we lose to the red you know that it's
fitting it is level three it's still a
fun one
um i do have to be honest with you
though like i can't be mad at that
turkey build that that's not like the
meta turkey build and at least
for the love of god
you peace
at least it's not
dodo rooster which has become the
it'll be the creamy cakes it has become
the genuine scourge of the meta
anytime you see someone rolling like
five ducks just in your head be like
that person will eventually be a dodo
rooster user
i think it's better to you know it's
safer to bet on that than
than to bet on um you know them having
some honor
i can't be mad that you're using what
works
it's just i i hate when my
if i'm running like a meme build i just
hate when that loses to like you know
goto rooster and you're like really like
this one of a kind run for me dies
because you just had to like get one
more win it's just it's a little painful
you know
i don't mind this now that being said we
are gonna run one of the most reliable
builds ourselves
which is like a
dog meta
dog very important engine
i think you could probably squeeze a
peacock in there
i love this
why don't you sell me
buy me freeze me freeze me i bet next
turn
we are going to sell well you know what
we should probably sell our pig
we've had a level three pig before um
you know it is what it is
i wouldn't describe it as
as a meme although it's pretty bad
i think you gotta sell this we get a
nice surplus of gold
then we can buy
get the buff sell
buy get the buff
sell
buy get the buff sell now i'll tell you
i know i said we weren't achievement
hunting
we'll buy get the buff sell um but we
actually are like um i've never had a
level three kangaroo before
i would be inclined to try this
um so or not kangaroo we've never had a
level three camel before and we've never
won with a level three camel that's
probably self-evident but um
so i actually think that the camel is a
good unit i would love to give it a
chance to really pop off here if i could
just get some more in the shop we might
have a great confluence of both memory
and enjoyment
it's a very groovy combination baby
we're gonna buy get the buff break the
wrist walk away
we're in a pretty blessed situation like
whatever gets the buff we're happy on on
those cells
honestly you're kind of you're kind of
cool you can stick around
that's it just in case me let's do this
it's not incredible but
we
i mean we're cruising right now
even though we only have a level one dog
with no extra
um
enhancements like we're we're just
chilling i mean this is just terrible
luck but also like it's not like as rude
as it sounds it's not luck
you're still running the horses plus
sheeps you shouldn't be surprised by
like round six when you get
you know you're getting fed
and not in a good way
very nice okay so i'm gonna say good bye
to you
you've served your purpose here well
thank you so much by the way take one of
those give me one of these
this is so automatic at this point like
and i know what i'm doing
let's just um i'm gonna do a sell me
there's a buy me really and then a sell
me and then a buy me and we're just
gonna hold it right here
on round six i think this squad is still
really good i really just want to see
more camels and more dogs would do
something this is gonna screw you up a
little bit
not really
not at all actually okay
well we we're at five wins already it's
very nice you're gonna get combined
we've got 13 gold this wonderful why
don't you take some garlic
we're looking for things for which you
know buying selling helps us
at all
they don't exist i think this time i'm
gonna buy
combine and then i'm gonna roll a little
deeper
and that provided us with with very very
little utility we have a
look we're doing great but we have a
problem looming on the horizon and that
problem is that our camel is is very
closely approaching complete uselessness
and that it's actually going to be an
issue
essentially immediately
as you can see
um
we need to buff our camel instead of our
dog
and
it needs to be hp
and we need another camel we need to get
one level up
which is why i actually think it's like
well worth um searching here freeze both
of those
even if we
admittedly that's pretty sick
even if we lose both of these rounds
or this round right here in the one
previous i think this will be worth it
for long term success
and this this looks winnable to me
this squad i'm not that impressed
that's all i could ask for okay look at
that
they got a little tight in there okay
but there we go
that's beautiful sell me
buy me come by me
very interesting you know what why don't
you buy me
do me a favor buy me
buy me
now we got a little something going on
here
is at least slightly better our deer
does not have to be here anymore
but and and yet here it remains
okay this blowfish is basically hard
reading me right now but it's fine we're
gonna come through i mean it's a dog i'm
not trying to act like we're blowing
them at a wide open
we are rolling a dog
as is the style at the time
why don't you
buy me
combine me
by me
combine me
i wonder if you can make a leopard work
here i really like the idea of like a
scorpion at the front softening up um
can cat doesn't work right
maybe it does
holy crap it does
what
okay well we don't have a unit that we
want to buy so let's just go for the
the sick
cat play if we lose we lose um
i didn't know can you probably have seen
it 20 times can cat works okay good to
know honestly we're losing to just a
better player
you can't be mad about that they're
rolling a monkey food squirrel build
anytime i see a squirrel you just got to
put some respect on it
we don't need melon armor yet don't let
them trick you
don't let them trick you into thinking
the melon armor is a necessity
snake is very nice though
feed
i'm gonna try something crazy
get rid of your meat
take a chili pepper
just in case
we got roosters we got turtles
we do have roosters there goes your
melon armor
you still are spitting out two of these
sons of guns that's not good but maybe
we can kill a dodo
thank you so much
we lose these okay
i mean look
we can run one more fast okay
if it's our little secret
dodo rooster
nullifies everything that comes after it
and i know i'm being a hater right now
you can call you can say i'm drinking
the haterade if it makes you feel better
if you're running dodo rooster you do
not have my respect there's nothing
wrong with that i'll be the crunchy nuts
if you're only out there to win to climb
the leaderboard so be it
i hope one day you reach a point where
you accept that you know
having fun is more important than just
running the same build over and over
again maybe yes maybe no um
either way it is what it is i i accept
it but you do not have my respect you
have my understanding
you do not have my respect though
my understanding is that winning is
always fun and in many ways winning is
more fun than having fun
if you didn't have fun but then you won
when you look back you're like that's a
lot of fun
if you're having fun but then you lose
like that just happened right there
sometimes you're like
you know well that wasn't fun at all
even though it was fun when you were
doing it
so i am gonna do the same thing over and
over again
just because the dog is like
oh you gotta buy it that's order order
um
the dog itself is not like meta defining
well kind of you know what i don't have
a leg to stand on i'm just gonna own it
if you don't like it napoleon you can
leave
at least it's not as oppressive as the
uh
as dodo rooster
like don't even give me star you've
already gotten me started but don't get
me started on dodo rooster man holy cow
okay we lose this but it was by an inch
no problem
we're gonna do a buy me
combine me
i'm gonna do it by me combine me but if
i got a pill i would still say goodbye
to the ants you know what i think we'll
do a little
i'm gonna do a buy me
freeze me
freeze me
freeze me
and probably next turn we're gonna say
goodbye to our whale and our ants is my
expectation
it's quite an interesting build we got
here very very similar squads cruising
that's a nasty whale man
we're lucky like the the math works out
in our favor
i think the math scene yes the math
works out in our favor all right now
this would be good just for my mental
health i feel like there is a 10-win run
in here
that's very nice
while we have limited animals let's buy
one of these really doesn't matter what
it hits the dog is ideal of course
you get back here
honestly
i think we benefit the most from
something like this
and then garlic armor although shrimp
scampi you know the shrimp scampi's got
some benefits of its own
for turn five this is nasty it's really
hard to kill an eleven nine unit early
meat would do it and and honestly i have
a lot of respect for this meat skunk
meta
it's very early to encounter a skunk you
don't expect it and yet still we made it
nevertheless we persist here give me one
of these
i'm gonna roll
i'm gonna i'm still gonna try this
ridiculous camel build okay
because i think
it's still in my head it still has some
gas
you can laugh at that phrasing all you
want
we're also now going to run
uh the dog in front of the fish which
you will look at and you'll say why
would you do this because it's going to
create a situation where um
i don't know about this by the way where
the the dog could have gotten one extra
buff
that's an incredible build
a camel that gets hit by many hedgehogs
thus buffing the unit behind it so it
doesn't die
my my wheels are turning right now
but anyway the long and the short of it
is i think one
um
1b spawning giving one extra stat
doesn't matter that much
sell me
buy me
you need a little more i'm just gonna be
honest you need a little more okay like
if we're gonna make this work the camel
we need another camel
i'm gonna go like full scumbag build and
i'll be straight up with you i think we
gotta dump a camel even though i just
said we need another one i then in my
defense i did then say we're gonna go
full scumbag build
freeze uh freeze me
freeze me
we're gonna dump a swan soon in fact
we're gonna dump a swan next in order to
supercharge um our bison probably
i just feel bad like bat you used to be
the king
and now look at you
sell me
buy me
and we have a problem i know i said
we're going to supercharge the bison
actually i think we got to supercharge
the dog
because it's the only thing we can
actually like we can't sell anything
anymore
so now would be a great time i was just
gonna say to purchase some cans
because at some point if we want to
pivot
it will be a pivot in the things that
will then have a lot of stats
but this i don't know i'm dude
this is a ruthless game like the meta of
super auto pets
we go through periods where it's like
you know cycling uphill and this this is
one of them right now i would say i
definitely feel like we we've had some
uphill battles
but uh you know
at least we're not running horse on turn
eight or whatever it is here so i think
you gotta at least you know
say your say your thanks for that
i will i'll just buy and combine but um
dude we got some strong units here we'll
just pull this one out right off the bat
at least it didn't hit two monkeys
if we get one more monkey we get the
space to get the dog engine going again
the oh that's really bad
[Laughter]
sorry we're not on lethal we're just
close
we're just very close
similar build but a scorpion at the
front beats us scorpion difference
scorpion difference
here i actually think you got to do this
there's a part of me that wants to roll
skunks but there's also a part of me
that's like nah man
roll scorpions
maybe like this now i mean this
a month ago this is easy 10 wins you
probably don't even have to ask you're
just like this is guaranteed 10 wins
i will say can i can i just say
something for ravlo
they did not run dodo rooster and look
where it got him like i understand what
brings people what what makes a man
neutral you know
i understand what what sends someone off
the deep end
has him doing things like like dodo
rooster
you know it's it's easy to slip into
becoming uh
that thing that you hated i mean what's
the most common reason
probably i'm guessing that people use
like aim hack in call of duty
i'm guessing that it's like well
everybody else is doing it so i like
gotta do it
this oh that's just terrible luck
honestly for you
like it's a tragedy of the commons
many of the people i guess i should have
sympathy many of the people that you see
that are running dodell rooster probably
hate dodo rooster but they just feel
like it's the only thing that they can
do and you know what
for that reason maybe instead of my
derision you have my sympathy
how did we get a 1919 scorpion so fast
this is the dream
okay i can feel my self-esteem coming
back
and you can judge me okay you can judge
me for using
dog bison monkey scorpion
but at least it's not the most popular
build and the most overpowered build
okay
it's the second most overpowered build
there's a difference
kind of
if we draw i would love to get a bison
out there
not bison leopard
it's like not even close
yeah yeah well you know well i don't
mean you know what you know what get out
of here we don't need bison scaling
anymore get out of here we don't need
scorpion scaling anymore
why don't you add two leopards into the
ecosystem
that will do eight damage to a random
enemy
and we'll keep the tiger in case we draw
we may lose this but hey at least we
brought out the we brought a little
sniping fun at the end
oh that's an insanely huge
if we don't roll the leopards we lose
there we get blown out by that hippo
okay that's great stuff thanks for
watching i gotta make a daycare run i'll
see you next time see you
