uh let's roll it back here but you know
we got to try to unlock the new
character okay
the way you unlock one of the new
characters you got to redacted the
redacted in their redacted
hole um but if you're not doing that
then you have to for the other character
beat lazarus without dying yeah beat
hard mode with lazarus without losing a
life
we're gonna give it a try okay
new curse of darkness just dropped and
it is uh it is mighty dangerous
the light has been real quiet since new
curse of darkness dropped
bet for the bat gods who i didn't know
that
there wasn't an escape path there um do
we do we have mods
it's a special occasion normally uh i
i don't support uh fictitious gambling
uh but nl i thought you were really into
the stock market now
[Laughter]
you don't understand risk adjusted
returns okay but like just
you know what i don't come to the
gentian impact forums and go
oh i did 17 5 star rolls and i still
don't have teresa
you know stay in your lane all right um
but today is a special occasion all
right we could get some gambling going
if we have mods around
if the mods are are willing to do it
thank you mods appreciated
much appreciated
are you doing alt path you know what you
need to be informed for the bet so i
understand the question
if the alt path is open and the run
seems good enough
i can't not try if the run is so bad
we're likely to die or hard mode doesn't
give us the consumables necessary to
access the path
then we will be taking the normal path
you know what
the moment was was foreshadowed on the
podcast
we have to how could we not take it when
when ed said they
they buffed it on the podcast this is
the specific item that
he talked about embrace chaos
greatest item doubters doubters
doubters are driving through downtown
vancouver
those are not new items seven cents for
the sack come on
begging for the location of zane through
text
you guys see that video from uh
vancouver where the guy
smashed the the kovid deniers
uh passenger side window with his bike
vancouver's been on public freakout a
lot recently
it has been like
every day there's like a 75 chance the
top post on
public freakout is from vancouver whoa
uh that's a faster shot now huh
what the what the
new steven just dropped gish has been
real quiet since new steven just dropped
okay i think we're good wait no no hold
on yeah
we're gonna take the alt path
temporarily dude honestly the first
alt path might actually be a huge
advantage because if you
step on the white fire you get an item
when you get another writer room you get
a boss you get another boss etc
etc oh was that snake eater
but for you
i think that's snake eater man halloween
this is halloween floor
dan any other game
i'll let you play your little your
little tricks okay your little
subterfuges
in isaac i'm the one who makes up the
fake names for the real things okay
if this was escaped from tarkov so to
speak
sure you want to call them invisible
marties or you know this is the marty
hall whatever
in isaac i come up with them this guy
right here
ninja spider of the aquatic variety
so shall it be ridden so shall it be
done
this is 2015 mathis when we have to
record a roundtable episode at the break
of dawn i.e 4 p.m eastern time ok that's
not very nice
i apologize
there were many days though when
he was like hey guys he was always on
time don't get me wrong but there were a
few days where he was like sorry i just
woke up
but you know what when you when you're
your own boss they let you do it
yes honey that is that is a yes honey
enemy
there's no question what the heck was
that
illuminati curveballs
i didn't see any white fire
blue fire
no fire no fire oh hold on we got to go
to our item room
you know what now oh it's in ah there's
no mirrors on the next floor of course
i was thinking maybe it was in the shop
i almost thought myself into a terrible
mistake
level of friction the coefficient of
friction much higher on this floor
i've noticed that i don't know if
anybody's talking about it i'm asking
the questions that
uh i want answered so much water on the
on the ground the coefficient of
friction is up
just curious why kick the bombs because
it
looks freaking sick is the
is the answer to your question looks
freaking cool
it's pretty wicked yeah like you would
you go to tony
hawk and be like hey tony hawk why did
you do three and a half
rotations on your skateboard when you
went up in the ramp you you know you
could just go up and then down
let's go saved and then we can get a
deal with the devil
by pressing the space bar in advance of
this uh boss fight
and it's all coming together double deal
with the devil incoming
i don't like this boss though and i
don't like i mean i find him
dangerous curse of the tower
he's right ed was right saved uh we'll
talk about that it's pretty good
so there is a synergy there's a synergy
associated with all three of these items
um it's very dangerous but also
uh very fun plus we're lazarus you know
i'm trying to unlock the new character
but
uh if you know like we gotta lean into
the zayn a little bit at least
for sure now we just need as much money
as possible
the problem is it's not a major problem
but the problem is
when we use satanic bible we guarantee
ourselves a deal with
the devil as our boss item which is
just a little dangerous
um because it makes it hard to get hp
like it's
it's a runaway uh positive feedback loop
because we won't have the hp to take the
deals with the devil which means we'll
want to use the satanic bible
so that we can get enough survivability
whether it's in the form of demon hearts
or otherwise
we need hp to live especially you know
games brand new we're going to be taking
a disproportionate amount of damage
so we might find ourselves a little
starved for hp
but you know what we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it we could
refrain from using satanic bible until
just after the boss fight and hope that
it gives us the kind of you know free
items we're looking for
but let's just think about it for a bit
scapular is pretty good too
no doubt about that um
i'm willing to and i know it's a little
it we're gonna lose damage here um but i
feel like we take this
and we take this as well and uh
then we just don't we have enough
survivability to
not use satanic bible as soon as we get
a charge
hopefully get hp from the boss and then
build off that for the future
i don't think i'm overthinking it i
think i'm thinking like exactly the
right way
there should be a mirror it's probably
the room just below there i guess oh
yeah because there's the white fire this
this could freaking come together man no
doubt about it
we don't want it okay don't use it yet
don't that's right we need two bombs
you're not wrong
i'm optimistic we can get the two bombs
no matter what like
just by going into the the minus
dimension but
might also die here don't think so
so not not a safe bet not a safe bet
love to see it okay
just use it i don't think so i don't
think it
i don't think so in the land of the bald
the one-haired man is king
oh you know what i could
well thank god we did all that for
marbles right i could just
um get hits
very interesting indeed i could just get
hit
and then curse of the tap well what am i
going to get hit by that's going to use
bombs there good point
i can't take it because i want to stay
alive in order to make uh
i don't know what that is either in
order to make the second character get
unlocked
hold on mystery medicine
it feels lucky i don't know
i don't know it's not cowardice it's uh
it's mathematics new trinkets
new trinkets just dropped
don't really want to go to the curse
room
mirror room all right so we got to go
into the minus dimension no
doubt about that that's a given
uh i'm like i hope that doesn't
extinguish the fire
uh the times will be pretty tough when
we come back there
take me into the minus realm all right
now what do we want to see in the minus
realm
uh hp ups from our item room would be
pretty sick
either that or we'll just accept we
won't be able to take every deal with
the devil but
that's that's a hard realization for me
to come to terms with
um we want to see two bombs as well
or one bomb even is fine and then we
could bomb ourselves
next to the door and curse the tower
we'll probably finish the job
truth be told it wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world to just beat hard
mode
the easy way and unlock a new character
but you know that's that's the coward's
way out
right i forgot it's not a real item room
where where okay shop is busted
but the boss is legit
keep in mind you're the lost right now
so devil deals
are free well well well
well well well well
just what we needed a little bit more of
a buff
on satanic bible
you use satanic bible you get a deal
with the devil for free
from the mirror boss and if the deal
with the devil is hp
oh man let's go
that's what we're looking for
yeah it does look better in general like
the the the game has had a lot of uh
like little graphical tweaks and uh you
know new filters and stuff like that
enemy sprites have been
uh augmented saved
there's a spicy hit no doubt about that
okay we could use two bombs but this
enemy like i know i
i shouldn't invite the comedic timing
this enemy is not that difficult to
not get hit by all you do is walk around
in a circle
and pick your moments
admittedly with the reflections i'm
feeling a little cursed right now
but this is just circle strafe 101
you know if you've ever played quake you
can beat this boss
easy money okay sulfur
even if it's free i'm not willing to
take the chance because it's not what we
want unfortunately
now does this work
already the bounty has already been
gleaned
you have backpack that is true you got
me on that one
i have nothing to offer in my own
defense
if backpack or if if sulfur would indeed
have been free we should have taken it
for sure
maybe we still can
it's good stuff okay you know what dude
no we can't check the cursor we might
die on the way out
how does the mirror realm work you can
get hit like once per room i guess
you always have holy mantle also you
just like you're
literally the lost hey what the heck it
still took my hp
i've been lied to i've you know what i i
shouldn't have let it happen i think i
got baited by a doubter
he got scammed
well jokes on the doubters because now
we have sulfur and sulfur is like
is the easiest item to win with in like
the whole game
your bombs ah
i need i was like i need the hp hold on
hold on
we can puzzle our way through this one
take me out
i'm willing to take a gamble on this i
know we could bomb ourselves and use
curse of the tower
but i'm thinking that a much shrewder
play is to
let god decide we're going to let god
decide
if you give me bombs back oh no god
decided against us
okay maybe we'll go not alt path this
time
secure the victory
secure the victory for the believers
and unlock the new character let me out
please
i mean this is not necessarily a one run
by believer standards either
i was gonna go back to the shop yeah um
because we still got a bunch of new
enemies and stuff
one of the best things about having a
high view count and an active chat
is that the kinds of comments that like
on youtube rise to the top where they
like
make a a a quotation mark that's like
you know
says he's gonna do x and then does
uh y instead it just it takes 20 minutes
to type it out and then it gets
heated up through the top of the screen
before even the fastest reader on planet
earth can
uh can uh parse what it says it's a
beautiful thing
i love it okay it makes my heart sing
take me down to the next floor oh hey
optimistical thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
give me some sulfur give me some salt
give me some salt you know that give me
some give me some salt get you guys
anybody here from mid-2000s brooklyn
indie rock scene
or alternatively pitchforkmedia.com
nope never heard of it all right
looks like you guys aren't ready for
that one but your kids are gonna love it
opinions on the national um
i mean come on you can't hate the
national but there are times where i'm
like i don't want to listen to this
music because i enjoy smiling
you know i remember this i remember this
item being
good battery pack
many batteries confirmed good although
some of those batteries oh we should
have done this in a different order but
that's okay some of those batteries were
a little
were a little weak but that's okay
goodbye money equals power you know what
it's a good point
but the thing is you know i'd rather
have hp now
and get the damage later the money's not
going anywhere we got uh
we got a not humbling bundle what's a
contract from below we got contract from
below
plus i've always been a proponent of the
idea that um
really like damage in isaac is is
overrated
the most important stat is range
if you can just get a range stat that
really like gets to the next level like
that's all that matters
range makes you op because most enemies
have finite range so they can't see you
or hit you when you're far away uh two
golden bombs
four calling birds three french hens two
turtle doves
and a one run in a pear tree okay so
we're
we got a great thing going on here i i
need to uh let tomo in tomo's beating
the door down
everybody wants a slice today okay
tomorrow
tell me oh my headphones
welcome hello now don't get down on the
courts
okay today's today's a cordless day for
the cats
today is a cordless there you go there
you go he's in
that's that's a good way of thinking
about it the most
important stat is just having fun
and being nice playing fair
show tomo no he's he's like in his box
right now i wouldn't
rip him out of his box uh just to show
him
if he's interested in being shown then
you know we'll talk about it
but dude this is a ripoff
instead of getting a deal with the devil
for free i'm getting a deal with the
devil for pay
satanic bible confirmed ruined
yeah that's not quite good enough oh but
we're free we're back on the alt path
boys let's go
[Laughter]
deal with the devil at full cost
annel i liked your edmond interview
thank you and you know it's
you know thank ed really
you know i i miss
missile man i thought you were called
miss lemon but missile man thanks for
the gifted subscriptions thank you
i uh you know you really gotta
hand it to ed on that one because i feel
like
for a lot of developers when they did
the interview or designers
they would want to be like um you know
i'm really just here to kind of like
pimp the game and
talk about like all the amazing new
stuff that's in the game and like so on
and so forth
and i was like no i don't wanna
i don't wanna be part of the marketing
machine i wanna ask you like what it
means to be a creator
and also a dad you know like and i
i was very thankful that he was like
generous with his both his time and his
thoughts when it comes to that
but i i didn't watch the other
interviews but i i saw some reaction to
them it seems like they're all really
well received
and they offered like different things
you know like some people were more
focused on like you know the
the meta conditions surrounding isaac
and some were more
focused on um like the getting into the
nitty-gritty of like what new mechanics
are gonna be and stuff like that so i'm
glad that there was uh
there was a variety there
yeah it's been on youtube for a bit it's
been maybe like a few days to spend on
youtube
at this point okay i was gonna say i'm
invincible but i
take that back i no longer feel
invincible um
we're gonna get bookworm do we want
satanic bible
instead of sulfur i don't know sulfur is
pretty good
what's going on with the monster manual
man it's literally sister maggie huh um
still not sure it had one room try out
and i'm like man i don't know about that
so stick with the i think i like our
existing setup quite frankly
uh hold on you get to keep the familiar
i have sister maggie still
it's permanent now what okay hold on let
me think about that
it only lasts for one floor okay
confirmed still not that impressed
only lasts for the floor i i sleep
what the heck is that brain worm ding
it's probably like a mix of all worms
together i guess
but it sounds like cinemasins
i want to see because if we can get it's
low chance and now like zero
but if we could get a guppy item then
i would be much more tempted to do the
uh guppy's tale but i think we're out
here
yeah i think we're good to go
brain worm is the best worm miss the key
ah last
it's uh nevertheless is too far back now
i dare not return
the journey is is we've come too far
we'll never make it
yeah we choose not to take it we're good
yeah we're good no doubt
alas poor yorick what the heck
i was i thought we were at a concert yo
the ash pit
it's invicta music bone flies
now i've seen everything
uh fruitcake caused my sulfur shot to
bounce
fruitcake works with sulfur now we're
talking
everybody wanted to eat it just so we
could hold on to sister maggie for an
extra floor
come on man come on i can't enter the oh
because you're still alive
um don't don't steal my charge
cube baby yo it's ice baby
but in a cube this is i from the panch
notes i saw
we're taking some damage if we're at
this point
were i a doubter i think i would be i
would be laughing
i would be going hahaha he's going down
but
uh it's it's up to me
you know we got satanic bible don't
don't let it slip away we got lots of
potential advantages here
i don't know what happened but i'm i'm
very for it yeah yeah yeah
exactly exactly okay here you know what
you do
i didn't see that come in come on man
come on come on
it's bone flies dude
the believers will rise again true will
never die
i like this fruitcake uh
sulfur synergy very much
it it makes me enjoy both items more
which is like my hallmark for
for whether a synergy is sick or not so
sick
and l what's your favorite toto song you
know what because like whenever i talk
about toto i just make enemies
like uh hold the line is like an okay
song
for like a not really a one-hit wonder
but you get the idea
africa is not a good song and the weezer
cover is even
more offensive to me what a kick
uh how did i miss come on little little
carrying queens
he's done it it's not as strong as i
thought it would be loving the black
holes here though
yeah i mean the weezer cover
okay um it's it's just it's the same
song
it's it's like my least favorite genre
of cover
hey the the other song is old so let's
like just
cover it and add nothing to it
just standing still man just standing
still taking damage
embarrassing
help yo the baby did us a great service
there though
um baby skull legs
baby skull x
i'm not taking a risk on this one i
don't
know i don't i don't want to play pong
i'm more of a frogger guy
good transformation good good
transformation
i don't know where to go man they keep
felt like i was playing what's that game
called
phasmagoria whether you get the swinging
axe blades
just leave man just leave is it duality
mushrooms
am i in a dream right now like what's
going on oh hello
you thought you could sneak by me
but you know the weezer thing you know
rivers is getting the last
laugh as he takes his board to work and
i'm stuck taking my stinky car
okay i know how this works
comedic timing
stand on the other side of the map you
know when you get a chance
kick those in there you never know how
they're going to work
nice shot yeah missed all the enemies
but that's okay
you sorry fool destroyed
algiers please hagelas i don't know
about that one
we are on four of six though this is
it's not looking so bad
i have no idea what our hp is like
that's that's the scary part for me
that's not helpful
imagine getting hit on the spider wave
like that's
it's just insulting how are we alive
like i deserve to be dead
well we probably will not be taking king
being conception
it's a little little much right now but
we are alive
why am i walking into the old floor
don't don't do it don't do it
take this
hold on when you die you're gonna give
me a charge
we use the charge per throw this it's
judas's shadow
we take it if we die we die we say we
don't care
we got we got stuff to do we got
unfinished business on this floor
we might not get the next character this
is how every uh
run has gone for me by the way as
lazarus i i
start by playing very conservatively and
then i'm like nah screw that
we're going all the way
[Laughter]
i put 20k on this well then get excited
because you're about to win
like a million i don't know
i don't know how it works
plus like the thing is you can't really
use your channel points for anything
anyway so
i wouldn't get too uh bent out of shape
one way or the other
come on you freaking pineapple hair
you're still alive down here
come on come on
shop but be careful when you spend your
money this time you got money equals
power
i still got to try the gift man it's
like one of the only ways we can get hp
it has to be done he's a genius
he's the smartest of all the gamers and
i will take this as well
okay now we're talking
we must have hit the other two yeah yeah
okay are we ready for this
i don't see why not
brilliant strategist i know what i'm
doing here i wish i
wish my speed were a little higher but i
know what i'm doing
we've been here before some of you
weren't here earlier in the stream and
it shows
flying seems good here yeah i guess like
if you're bad and you need help then i
could understand
that but
i'm on the other hand i'm just built
different
okay it's very simple it's all it's not
about your movement
it's about the dodging
saved
saved yet again because he's the world's
greatest gamer
isaac go go go go go
he's so good
he's so good he's so good he boomed me
the greatest dodger since pedro martinez
it is crazy that you can't use your own
consumables down here
that really puts a damper on it
like that's a tough throw
he's not free he's not free saved
that's a tough one that's not helpful
[Laughter]
we got one we got we made space we made
space okay
sneak just sneaking in there we need the
key
i see now that we need the key
what am i doing i need the key maybe
when you're holding the bomb the key
goes
this thing goes down what's happening
i need is there a switch
bomb the key to push it away dude thank
god for twitch otherwise i would be
i would just die there on youtube
without a doubt
i wouldn't it never would have crossed
my mind despite being so obvious
i would have been stuck there forever
okay a little little close
like i'm just gonna say nobody else will
say because they want to coddle you
but if you've ever died or
god forbid even taken damage on that
section you should probably just
go back to um roblox
like i don't know if i could face twitch
chat after taking damage on a room that
easy
i'd probably just i don't know man i'd
be done with games i might go back to
stuff like maybe crossword puzzles or
something
something more your speed yeah
go back to pixelmon
[Laughter]
got him
you know if you really if you're
struggling i can print out some word
searches for you
that hurt that hurt now what's our hp
like
oh it was fine why was i i was being a
baby
that being said this curse of the
darkness is gonna be a little nasty for
sure a little nasty curse
freaking sexy curse
up your gamma how about you put the
gamma up yours
actually it seems like a good idea but i
did i it's one of those things where you
get like a lot of
uh different answers from people right
like
one of the oh we shouldn't do this we
only have eight cents
one of the things that was tweeted this
morning like somebody tweeted me and
they're like
before you play repentance you should
know
do not turn up your gamma like it
something something and i'm like dude
what i haven't even
just like this is what happens you see
when you when you go
and you stay awake instead of going to
bed at a normal hour or living in the
best time zone in the world pst
you you watch too many other streams you
hit me with like these these
fringe pieces of feedback i don't even
know how to interpret like
they're like i can't tell you why but
don't do this thing
and i'm like i don't just makes me want
to do it more because
you know you're telling me i can't do
something with no reason why
but i you know they probably did adjust
the gamut down a little bit so i
i wouldn't i mean this is the way the
game is meant to be experienced the
snyder cut
it goes to 11.
all right i got to admit that's a lot
better like
much like mini hud i protested too much
and it really did change the game like
that looks so much better
i still can't see everything but
at least i can i can make out some some
vague shapes
oh i knew it was coming too that's
i'm i'm stuck don't forget you're here
forever
that sucked pretty bad uh thank you
scapular
i would say is a very high percentage
chance we're coming back as dark judas
oh this is this is the lazarus respawn
okay just give it a sec
give it a sec i mean we'd rather die and
come back as dark judas but we don't
have to do it right away
because i can't remember if you respawn
in the same room or in the next room
i don't i have no idea what's happening
at all
but we lived okay now that we've died
once
as help
uh lazarus we can no longer unlock
the boss so we should die to become
dark judas
get that sick damage upgrade
and then get as many demon hearts as as
we're allowed
imagine being like this is bad for the
uh believers are you aware of the power
of dark judas
it's not help help me
i'm gonna die okay you know
that things got a little spicy on that
room
imagine being a doubter right now that's
all i have to say
okay we're chilling check this out
not what i was looking for confirmed
i'm scared of pushing these buttons just
let work me back a sec here
rooms that are new are scary rooms that
are old
not scary just fun
we can't take taurus here speed is too
low instead we'll take bbf
which is gonna get us killed
hold on you got you got fruitcake we got
we got all sorts of stuff working out in
our favor here
this is a boss trap room pop this
saved
there we go saved that's the save you
versus the save
she told you not to worry about now we
will probably win this run easily
just pay out now doubter confirmed what
you scared doubters
shot speed down who cares lemon party
who cares
now we got three hp 18 damage
18 damage okay it's easy sweep
and then it's so simple
it's not simple i'm a fool i'm a genius
i just can't imagine like putting your
money on
on doubt who are you the melvin capital
of twitch
really makes you think i would love to
fly
like feel like flying is worth like
like three hearts per floor
not just in terms of dodging but also
like you know being able to pick up like
those batteries for example
yeah i just want to fly oh what you what
oh what you want sugar ray baby
sorry some of you guys aren't ready for
music that's that heavy but
milk you know we have so much damage how
could i not at least
oh it's buddy in a box that's
interesting so we got a big damage
downgrade but it came with triple shot
which is pretty good
let's go we in this i'm here to tell you
believers act like you've been there
before okay
it's still pretty tough i'm not i'm not
fully convinced on this one yet
we try this yet range down i'm not gonna
take it
bold choice i'm not gonna
guess i'll die like okay
that that room um
i i may have to pick up the red
telephone for that room
i'm not totally sure about that one
maybe i've just got to pay more
attention but i'm like it's a bit much
that you get
shoved into the corner and then uh
also have to take damage coming out the
other side what the heck
no
pay out the doubters
we were right that we had it the room
was under control
an attempt was made on that one slash
marker
repentance two now that one hurts let me
let me
get it out of the queue of my brain by
going to twitch.tv now



you only get one chance to make a first
impression and i've already
had my first impression made of the game
because of the fact that i played a
little on youtube but you only get a
second chance to make a good first
impression on the stream
here we are the first streamed run of
the binding of isaac repentance uh
central 272. thank you for the gifted
subscriptions as well and
woodfox thank you as well i apologize
things are whipping by pretty quickly
right now
so uh i i appreciate all the support
from cowboy killer for example
but we're just gonna we're gonna have to
focus on the run a little bit here
see some new stuff of course you play as
isaac first okay
oh you stole my you stole my charge no
wait dude yeah you stole my charge you
jerk
i meant i'm at zero and now they're like
uh
they're not upset anymore they stole all
my my lithium
how dare they rude lightning bugs that's
a good name
i've been calling them yellow flies i
don't know if you can understand how i
got the inspiration for that but
it's the honest-to-goodness truth been a
little bit more
uh free form shall we say with the way
i've been playing the game you know
because this brand new
trying to experience some of the new
stuff there are a few things i've
noticed
for example uh in particular enemy shot
speed seems to be improved
uh well like increased at least enemy uh
fire rate or at least like the attack
speed
also seems to be much higher as well um
new patterns obviously some some areas
afterwards
you got to take it robo baby oh
nice sound though how about that
you're still around i used to watch you
when i was 10 i'm
70 now thank you for your service sir
appreciate everything you've done for
this country have you noticed as well
that the
um the shop is open by default what's up
with that
and you can get all sorts of cool items
like tier detonator and then not have
the charge necessary to reroll them
hey you know what though hold on hold on
maybe it's been changed
i don't think so but still it's worth a
try
um i'm going to get a little spicy here
maybe maybe i shouldn't but you got to
give it a try right like
i'll do you one more i mean come on it's
only uh
you know five gifted subs on the line no
big deal
what's with the popping sound um excuse
me the popping sound
shows some respect that's robo baby he's
doing his best
and i will also say the game is uh
very hard
[Laughter]
i i in the interview with ed i
definitely i had the tendency to be like
you know he was like hey hard mode's
actually gonna be difficult and in my
head i was like yeah but he means for
like normies not for like
god gamers like me um
but uh i he meant for even god gamers
such as myself
yo z master zion thank you you didn't
have to do that but i appreciate it
thank you
cube of meat now we're talking of course
i should have known it was coming but
that's that's good stuff
um so i think we're we're out of here
man
yeah we're out of here we're gonna go
down to the special floor let's get
excited here
cobalt died on his first run i'm i'm i
i shouldn't say i'm happy to hear that
because it sounds like i'm being super
rude
but i am i'm happy to hear that from the
perspective of
like um you know at least i wasn't the
only one
[Laughter]
okay hold on there's gonna be a bucket
boy a hundred percent i predict
hey what the of course they're shooting
because they always shoot
hmm mom's bra or a question mark
this is where you start doing the monty
hall problem you hit the space bar on
this one
spilled milk or a question mark that's
an easy decision oh son of a
[Laughter]
now i wish i took the question or the
spilled milk maybe they've changed it
but you know what we're building quite
the stable of uh familiars here i
suppose
got a long way to go until we get some
some usefulness here like
uh an orb wait hold on i remember
i remembered this item triangle man
doing the things a triangle can it's a
space bar item that does something
related to brimstone
temporary demon form sulfur
i think it's brimstone for one room or
something that's pretty good
and by the way i mean did you see the
diagonal walking
no big deal um i i was surprised how
much i remembered of uh
of anti-birth when i started playing but
then i i remember i guess i have spent
like you know
probably like a hundred hours or so
maybe
a little bit more on anti-birth i played
it for a reasonable length of time
now many people will tell you this was
probably not the right room to use
sulfur on and i think those people are
absolutely correct
um we very realistically could end up
dying
you know our our first boss i'm a little
uh
or second boss i'm a little scared by
the boss rooms like it reminds me of
being a
young little whippersnapper playing
isaac for you know the very first time
getting hit
17 times on the monstro fight being like
how could anybody possibly predict these
movements
uh but we're gonna we're gonna do our
best hold it together
the problem with the orbital is we we
don't have like
the muscle memory for all these enemy
patterns you know set in our brain yet
so it's very like difficult to walk into
the enemies and and just hope for the
best right
okay what's going on with the pool
bucket maybe i don't want to know lil
blub
little blub you're you know what i've
never been happier to have uh robo baby
we'll just keep our distance and and try
to preserve this 100 deal with the devil
chance
that we've already seen now that i think
of or now that i remember but that's
fine
oh snap mom found my bucket
mom it's not a poo bucket i told you
it's my
jenkim fermenter it's a delicacy
in some parts of the internet
that's a good item okay i mean mostly
for survivability but still i'm eating
um i'm i'm happy where we stand i choose
not to take this
i choose not to take this we gotta be a
little we gotta
slow our roll a little bit we gotta
relax
we got brimstone once every three rooms
what do we do
we oh you gotta hit the buttons you
gotta hit the buttons it's that simple
what happens if you push this too far
away to be able to hit the button
or blow up the rocks i guess you just
wait
until the the door opens up
you just lose lull forehead
okay what do you do oh i remember you
okay see i've got i've got some memory
of these items
yeah the doors they open automatically
after a bit but
so we have new baby that i remember
but i don't remember what it does but
here's the thing it's a familiar
so let's add to our ridiculous familiar
account
iced iced baby i knew it i knew we were
getting conjoined man
that is unexpected um that's that's a
transformation that's pretty rare
perfect lilith run
yo new tier effect just dropped
mr freeze has been real quiet since the
repentance patch just dropped
okay we got six keys and no money why
can't i have six money and no keys man
conjoined used to need five familiars ah
see that's why i you know i've played a
lot of isaac
i'm very happy that the the chats here
to keep me honest with some of the
mechanics that might
escape me i.e anything that is not just
like
dodging and shooting in particular i
don't really know what's happening here
um so i'm just gonna pick up this money
and get the heck out of get the heck out
of here
get that are you gonna hit some enemies
you kick some enemies uh brimstone
please thank you
we could use some statistics
some attributes would be very helpful
he's spinning me
he's got me caught in the in the riptide
man remember when you couldn't go
anywhere without hearing that song
gotta swim
you don't remember that one
i do he's got you wrapped around his
finger
dear
oh wait a minute that's right hold on
if you used in in anti-birth
if you used sulfur twice in the same
room
you got a permanent brimstone upgrade
i remember that now it's been a while
now if we get a battery charge the dream
may come to pass
i'm looking at this i gotta be i gotta
be honest with you i'm looking at this
maybe we could get a battery but we need
two batteries in the shop because we
don't have it full charge now
um i think
i think we have to go everyone's saying
oh i okay i see the spoiler now all
right all right
you can't it's not enough for you is it
just to watch the new stuff it's always
gotta
you gotta eat your 100 steak in a single
bite
all right so you step on this
and then you you enter the the minus
realm
no i'm not sweating the spoilers i mean
again it like it's really just a matter
of like when you want to expose yourself
to
the spoilers and i think that i i accept
that you know most of what i know about
isaac in general essentially came
from uh
being told so i
i don't mind the spoilers quite frankly
okay hold on we're in dark side of the
moon right now
so very cursed anti-troll bomb is very
cursed
i do wonder if you get hit in the mirror
world i wonder what happens
i'm gonna guess that when you get hit
uh i'm gonna guess you got spit out but
i did get hit once and it didn't happen
oh that's red knife piece one and then
you get knife piece two somewhere else
as well and then you get ah
yeah yeah yeah i remember now
okay just keep it moving we should be
doing the occasional little brimstone
andy here for sure
but don't forget i do love you know
kicking these enemies
i think we can leave now but if we don't
leave we might be able to get
a battery charge from the shop create
permanent brimstone and win the run
and become the greatest isaac gamer that
pleasant park has ever seen
i don't know the keys look so messed up
when they're reversed i don't know like
what what happens
if we fight you i don't want to use
brimstone against you because i want to
save the possibility for a charge here
i'm also worried if i get hit once i'll
die
but you know who theirs wins man again
what's the worst what's the worst thing
that could happen oh we have to give out
a bunch of gift subs
no big deal my my daughter goes hungry
cause
dad didn't think he was gonna die he had
too much hubris down at the isaac casino
again
whatever i'm i did it i'm amazing
that's an item i can get down with that
baby baby's gonna be fine i was just it
was mostly a joke
she might have to downgrade to the uh
the long range model instead of the
performance though okay
we're we're safe again we're free
now we go to the shop and if the shop
has
a battery charge we might be able to
cheese it but then
this might not be a repentance mechanic
we're gonna go can we go back into the
mirror realm
maybe we can go back into the mirror
realm
f f f f nope all right well you know
what
i think we're going to buy a spear at
heart and we're going to head down to
the next floor and we're going to
continue to live our lives
and learn about the game piecemeal
instead of all at once
it's a valuable bomb though don't get me
wrong
oh right we got bombs hold on i thought
we were gonna get stuck here
please get the yoyo string
i may consider getting the yoyo string
sick mundus vibes yeah i'm like it i'm
just you know what it is i'm enjoying
the brief period about the game
where like chad's been watching some
other streamers and they think they got
it all figured out man
because all i'm gonna say is that the
the world change is mighty quickly
especially uh in this day and age you
know right now
people are like i think i got it all
figured out just wait until you see
something you ain't never seen before
because all the other streamers are
dying on like the caves one
okay mysterious liquid plus conjoined 10
out of 10
setup
i have no problems here i still want to
like i want to save uh
the sulfur much like
uh city in color saved their scissors is
that who sang that song maybe it was
just dallas green i can't remember i
don't listen to a lot of canadian radio
these days
yo the song is kind of poggy
check this out you're not ready for that
one yet but your kids
are gonna love it oh i forgot red button
damages everything okay how's that for a
spoiler
i'm not trash talking sim victor i'm
trash talking apollo
okay sorry that was really bad dodging
oh
it would be like i'm can i tell you the
first few runs i did of this today
i was very happy that we did lost runs
yesterday because to get in the habit of
not having much hp
um that was that was very very uh
nice i think that helped me out a lot
today
now what the heck do we have here mom's
bracelet oh i
hold on hold on check this out
now i gotta be honest with you sulphur
is like
probably better can i pick this guy up
oh man come on come on can i destroy him
with it
no this is kind of fun
like obviously we can use it for like
you know
blowing things up like getting cool
mechanics
based stuff but we can also pick up some
rocks and throw them in enemies which
i'm sure does a lot of damage
the charge time is really uh
it's quite uh low on that
pick mom up i bet you'd like that
wouldn't you
sicko okay this is definitely a second
secret room you can't sneak that
by me um what are you
a punk demon judgment
i don't know take my money
[Laughter]
okay and then oh no
i've doubled it up did it did it work i
don't
i don't know it looks kind of sick
though
all right you okay this is a it's a
gauntlet fight you just got to survive
the waves
yo it it's thick brimstone kick it
it'll be fun please please
proptosis brimstone bro
i have infinite range could i i just
need to shoot this guy where it where
the heck
the charge time the charge time i
thought that was my fire i don't even
have fire what are you talking about
you're okay you're okay you remember
great stuff great stuff do it again
wave five please there we go wave five
yankee hat with thick brim now we're
talking
wave six i desire wave six
i don't even know what it is i'm very
happy that i have like
pseudo-infinite range here otherwise we
would be in a world of hurt you've
unlocked the ash bit
of course not a problem uh do we have
cool room
no cool room on this one
now here's the moment of truth do we
still have anything when we leave
no okay but that's neat it's good to
know
so if you use sulfur twice on the same
room you get a cool brimstone
honestly i'm going to be straight up
with you i think that's a sensible nerf
uh being it basically being one battery
charge away from being able to create
brimstone
uh yourself is that's pretty powerful
what if you use it three times oh
oh what an interesting idea
yeah i've seen the other um
some couple or a couple of other
streamers play the game with the mini
item hud
uh sell me on it okay so like the the
thing with it
look i've been wrong before it allows
you to see
all of the items right like not just the
the most recent eight or whatever
it takes up less room does it though or
does it
actually take up more room once you get
more items
let's see mini hud
yeah you know i think it definitely
takes less room i apologize for my
rhetorical question
it looks much better i feel like i just
had a breath of fresh air or something
like i feel i feel nice
that's it i feel like i can see
something oh
no no time and score either oh dude
you're right but how will i know what my
score is if i don't have my score on the
screen
i'm gonna be so confused about what my
score is at
and how will we know if i'm making boss
rush well that's easy enough i i'm not
even
i've never been even close to making
boss rush in in repentance so far
now we still got some problems okay
damage is slightly better than usual
i think our rate of fire is okay
i'll open that for sure for sure for
sure um
i actually think i don't want mega brim
for a room
so simple as this it's not necessary i'd
rather get an extra brim on a future
floor
or on a future room i should say
and this is so far we definitely i i
would
remain pessimistic as of right now
about our ability to win the run
but very optimistic about our ability to
have a good time
and to hope both teams have fun and
everybody out there watching from home
uh has a good time i'm just rooting for
a good game
i just hope all the players have fun so
i
i kind of like the idea of box of
friends but it's like
i i i gonna take some more convincing
i'm just gonna be honest like
i don't think our familiars are are that
big of a deal right now unfortunately by
the way like uh if you're
if you're watching along it's possible
especially if you came from youtube
you don't watch the streams
all that often we've screwed it up i
wonder it
i i you put a bomb in this you hit this
and then you kick it really fast
that's what we're talking about um yeah
if it's your first time here
uh give me a follow i'm just gonna ask
for it you know we're gonna be playing
isaac a lot
like most of the time i i play a lot of
isaac don't get me wrong but it's mostly
been on youtube in the past
we're riding a new wave of of fatherhood
um so i've been doing a lot more twitch
we'll be playing a ton of isaac here
and you're probably gonna maybe you're
gonna be on youtube and you're gonna be
like what the heck where's the four
episodes a day
well they're on twitch and they take a
couple extra days to get to youtube so
i would encourage you to you know strike
while the irons hot if you like what you
see
and if you don't you know no pressure
either way
i'm scared i would love to see hold on
what do we need here
i'm going to call it because can you
imagine oh my god the cl the clip
farming if this ends up being correct
the number one item we need right now is
the relic if we can get the relic
if we can get the relic this is if
you're not familiar with the culture of
twitch this is called clip farming
you bet on the likelihood of something
happening if it happens
you get uh an incredible clip
if it doesn't happen you disable clips
so that you don't even need to know
if the relic shows up in here 100 gives
subs to chat
sorry chad edmond doesn't want you to
get give subs
sorry explain yourself edmond
backstabbed again
an attempt was made that's fine
it's all good you know it's we're just
in you know real
survival hours right now half-life full
life consequences
what if you got it i would i would honor
the terms of the deal but i would have
to make a quick phone call to visa first
it would disrupt the stream the stream
slightly
wonder what maybe we've got to hit all
the golden buttons to get the
to get that path unlocked
certainly seems like it okay okay very
interesting
at first i thought we just had to be
really quick but yeah i think we got to
hit all the buttons
and then we get in the mine card
this is where you're gonna get the
second key piece
maybe yo this is this is kind of like
gungenesque in here huh
what the heck was going on
i'm scared about what's gonna happen
like it's gonna be like a crash
bandicoot section or something like that
when we leave here we're gonna get
chased by something
i knew it i knew it get me out of here
[Laughter]
i know what they put they put up the
blockers man oh
they don't want you to win they don't
want you to get healthy
there you go dodge of the cinch
he's going he's going this is we've
trained for this
just take your time how do i get out man
this is not how you get out
i need the bomb great great throw great
throw kid
don't get cocky okay send it send it
we're free
spikes
mommy
just chill no he's so good he's the
greatest player of all time
what the you weren't even on the screen
you liar
little weasley liar dude okay i see what
we got to do here
keep it moving keep him we're almost
there almost there almost there he's
done it he's not he's free
oh but she's mad she's mad
okay i don't know what those sounds are
but i'm i'm very frightened but gaming
has been accomplished
the true isaac gamer has logged on that
was
that was a little scary but for a first
try i thought we did pretty good and
plus we got this cool little knife now
freaking sexy knife doing all this
damage out here
there's a tinted rock in there no i
don't believe you
i don't believe you
hold on i can i'm not looking at chat i
can find it i'm not
owned oh it's the wrong room i'm not
owned
so it's jeez right under my nose
thank you chad thank you couldn't have
done it without you you got to step on
the button
saved okay 46
chance of a deal with the devil i would
say it's probably lower just because i'm
fairly likely to lose this half spirit
heart and take damage but
you know only time will tell a strength
card
i don't know if the i feel like the
strength card based on what i know about
these deals with the devil now
i feel like the strength card might be a
little nerfed like you might have to use
it more for its
intended purpose now instead of it's uh
you know the meme play where you use it
to
scam and deal with the devil
so what a shot man if you hit a frozen
enemy
into an enemy i think it freezes that's
that's pretty high value eats
memes will still work can i tell you i'm
just a little frightened here i just
want to go take a look
i just want to go take a look first
maybe the shop has red hearts for sale i
don't know do i have to donate more to
the shots
to the shops i should say
i don't know oh placenta i forgot we got
placenta
from the mirror realm dude now knowing
that there's other items we can get
there more easily
i understand i understand where we're
going here you take a sip of the bubbly
i remember these guys nl's stream
actually bigger than an f1 driver uh you
have a which
which f1 driver
i'm not gonna name names but you know if
lewis hamilton was streaming and we beat
him in the view count i'd be like
he's like one of the greatest drivers of
all time
you take my hp i don't mind go ahead
take it
take take my blood if you need it
no hp for us okay we're heading down to
the next floor
hold on magic mush
you gotta look
oh wait it's okay it's just the speed up
but that's still pretty good
all right here we go here we go
orlando no it's impossible lando is both
a
an amazing driver he came in fourth this
weekend
which is insanely good um and i am not
being facetious for people who aren't
aware of f1
and also the ultimate meme lord
i would never i would never dare in salt
land though
you won't find me doing this too much
it's it's a new era
and yet the more things change the more
the more they stay the same
okay we like it we like it a lot we like
it a lot a lot
that's pretty good
i don't i don't know where my hp is at i
know that they
nerfed
i know they nerfed uh demon
judgment so now you can't double play
him
but still we have hp
i'm gonna get i gave you three and then
i'm gonna go get a little taste over
here
yeah yeah yeah why
well it just makes sense like i know
that people anytime there's a nerf the
developers
have to justify themselves way more than
when there's a buff and like some of
this stuff
like you know the cramp is being nerfed
to you know every six rooms and then
possibly uh change back spoilers uh in
the in the new version
like that stuff is kind of uh
you know i i wouldn't necessarily
describe it as anti-fun but i think that
it was a nerf nobody asked for
the demon judgment stuff to me it seems
kind of like
sensible like why could you double play
a demon judgment to begin with it just
seems like an error
oh whoops i forgot you you throw some
rocks at me um
it seems like an error of like the the
default
uh invincibility frames that you get
from getting hit is too
uh is too high so i i think it made
sense that was one i was i was not salty
to
discover i was like you know you're mad
for like two seconds because it takes
away one of your engines and then you're
like you know what i think it's actually
fairly sensible
it made sense to me at least
now removing uh the double sulfur in the
brimstone plate
somebody better lose their job for that
uh mishap
oh no baby
the devs have gone too far when will you
learn that your actions have
consequences okay we got a lucky penny
if we give relic 100 gift subs
okay now you're putting me in a tough
spot because
you have to take contagion so i i
basically removed the clip farm ability
there but that's a really good item
that's one it's hard to say no to i
apologize
i'll admit it could have been the relic
and if it was well we just saved
ourselves
some some money okay quick little smack
that's very sad it's fine now it doesn't
just seem
satisfying though like it seems uh
it seems really good like it it seems
like a good
like aoe type option it's kind of neat
i'm down to explore that a little bit
more ice shots seem insanely good
so i gotta i'm gonna spoil something
about an upcoming isaac episode for you
an upcoming repentance episode but i
really i want to ask you okay
because i i don't know what was
happening yeah so victor maybe you saw
it on your stream
i did a run and all of my boss items
were uh deals with the devil
what's up with that man
like i i the first time i got it oh
because of satanic bible
of course i did have satanic bible
i did so dude that's a cool
people are saying is a nerf i actually i
understand why it would be a nerf
but all your boss items become deals
with the devil
like they have to deal with the devil
effect like you have to pay for them
with hp but they also have to deal with
the devil
uh pool that's amazing
no it still generates the demon hearts
for you too every six rooms like that's
that's pretty sick man
that's pretty sick okay hold on what do
you
what do you want from me what do you
want from me here
i i know what you want from me check
this out i'm a gamer
i'm a gamer i'm not like other
hobbyists i'm a gamer i'm a gamer
he's gaming um okay mausoleum one we're
ready we're ready
i vaguely recall you existing in
anti-birth
you you're a siren you sing songs and
you you took my familiars against me
she's turned the wings against this
sorry i apologize the accent is just not
good i might just turn the wings against
you
oh yeah yeah we're fine
turns out we're fine go ahead take them
they're trash
okay well that's a little rude not the
trash thing but
you know us getting hit by the physical
damage come on
you've unlocked joanna 1 million percent
just stop
i'm so good
[Laughter]
i just i just beat the game
okay this is this is mighty tricky for
me because
uh help uh i
i don't really want to
get rid of sulfur
but i do want to forget me now
so let's do it it'll be fun
it'll be fun that's that's my main
driving force right now it'll be full
it'll be full it'll be fun uh we do have
that demon judgment back there we played
a lot of but i'm i'm not convinced
that it's about to pay out
how many episodes of of isaac have you
recorded
not that many honestly um
i think there's three in the books right
now
okay let's see if we get some spirit
hearts if we get some spirit hearts
i'm much more likely to play the demon
judgment a little bit
still got one that's not bad no keys
remain
one sec this this is valuable man we got
good stuff happening here
no hold strength strength is worth
something
this is a yolo run a free yolo marty you
definitely blow this up
also very good one two
three please
i'll take it i believe in you
got me that's pretty good though
um i'm gonna strengthen do it two more
times
and then one more time
i'm scared yo saved saved
okay and then saved
i thought that said boat speed up and i
went
what all right okay okay we going to the
course room we forget me now inside of
the curse room
yes
he's he's a mad genius he's ascended
that's still pretty good it's not items
but it actually might be more valuable
okay mausoleum one with tons of hp
my dad is your biggest fan yo that's
actually sick
like i'm always thankful
when people are like i love watching
your videos that's a nice thing to hear
um but when someone's like i watch your
videos with my family
and they think you're hilarious i'm like
they got options man
and they've been on this earth a lot
longer so like the compliment just means
that much more
you know when someone's like 12 and
they're like i love your videos i'm like
what do you know you know you've never
even seen
a fellini film you don't know what's out
there
when someone's like 65 and they're like
i like your content i'm like oh man
that's incredible
sharp key i remember it's a it's a
throwable mom's knife that also is like
infinite keys or something like that
something like this like i don't want to
use it for nothing just in case i'm
misremembering it but something like
that
i wish that my girlfriend liked your
videos i'm here to tell you like
honestly don't sweat it that much
um i'm just trying to figure out sorry i
was in the middle of making the bit
and i stopped but it's because i'm
trying to figure out what the heck this
item does
um it just does it use keys
it uses a key every time you shoot it
okay that's a lot
um that's you know it i bet it does a
lot of damage but we'll save that for
situations where we have some uh
we have the ability to recklessly spend
some keys
um it's all good like kate and i we
don't really watch
a lot of the same youtube content
it's just too much man just give me a
second leave me a second to think about
that
like you used to we used to watch like
some good mythical morning together and
stuff like that
it's nice to have shared hobbies but you
know you also you know you like what you
like
we gotta take it for the synergy for
sure
i mean honestly it's really boring but
like thanks to placenta we have a really
good
opportunity to just stay alive no matter
what okay the heretic
i okay yeah i remember you we gotta like
blow up your familiars and then the
pennies take care of themselves
by the way mysterious liquid has now
become the the strongest item
in video game history as a result of
this uh
this uh dr fetus synergy like assuming
the enemy was actually
a terrestrial enemy on the ground
that's tough to dodge you know what i
i really hope that that would do a
little bit more damage with the key but
all right all right all right okay
now krampus here here's your your
spoiler i have
gotten krampus's head and they did
restore the pre-nerf
uh charge limit to it which is pretty
sweet
that's pretty sick and honestly is sick
enough i think we're gonna roll with it
because we're not really
running on keys right now we don't we
don't have a ton of them so let's take
marrow always nice
you love to see it we we i should have
taken more hp there my mistake
um you know we we stand
a development team that's that's not
afraid to walk
back on popular uh decisions
now edmund if you're still here i'm not
like other gamers like
i'm i'm uh a gamer who blames myself for
all of my problems
uh so i personally thought it was fine
if anything i thought you should
actually nerf it a little bit more like
maybe make krampus head like an item you
can only use one time
good luck kid you know what i love about
a dan raid
you can tell that it's a dan raid
without even knowing that it's a dan
raid like tell me you're a dan raider
without telling me you're a dan raider
yes sir yo
ox can i get a bacon egg and cheese
salt and pepper ketchup mayo on a roll
yes sir you already know the vibe can't
forget the bev you know i gotta cop that
area yes sir
dana oh and this is i'm being very
sincere
of let me rephrase the stream
that i watched you play this morning
where you were playing this game
i was very impressed with your play no
joke
i was like you know i i watched you play
a little isaac
maybe three or four months ago and i was
like i feel like this guy has no idea
what he's doing and then i watched you
play today and i was like what the heck
he was
he was sandbagging the whole time this
guy was just pretending to not know
the the language of isaac when actually
he he speaks it fluently
smiling impact
uh goat head monkey s but i am here to
tell you
dan that the shoes on the other foot now
now it is you who should be careful
because you're gonna get spoiled because
we're about to
bust this mystery wide open
i mean are you seeing this run when we
shoot they shoot
that's that's tough um but you know what
would make it easier
it didn't work oh you can't kill him
just step on the button fool
okay even better but you gotta admit
it was a 200 iq play if it worked
that would have been a 200 iq play oh
they charge
it's like it's hades
wow sounds like david lee roth at the
end of the shot of the devil
what's going on oh it's you
scared scared
no are you scared i'm not scared i'm not
owned
saved
teleport me thank you this is it's easy
people have been saying oh they made the
game too hard
i don't think so man check this out you
know you just gotta remember what it's
like to be uh
to have a game that isn't afraid to make
you work for it you know
i know a lot of games out there are like
oh
i did everything right but the i the
impostor i sussed out
got hard cleared by somebody else and
now i lost because of something that i
couldn't control
come on man you got to get back to a
game that's not afraid to
it's not afraid to kick you in the face
a couple times you know what i mean
stop roasting among us they chose
violence
when they chose to release their new map
on the same day
that repentance came out repentance was
ahead in
in the lineup they announced it in
september 2018 when among us was
was a mere fever dream
they chose violence never forget
that's a good chest man that's a good
one
no turrets please thank you oh look at
that
so inspirational
i wish it wasn't among us though because
the developers seem very nice and
wholesome
and i am rooting for them
but you know when when you come for the
king of the indie games
you best not miss
i can recognize mathias voice
the heck is jihana too
new mom new mom just dropped i've taken
oh yeah you can't walk into the foot
anymore
oh but dude she's gonna get freaking
bodied
by uh by the creep
she's done she's toasted she never stood
a chance and then we have the key
so check this out
[Laughter]
oh what i forgot about that part
mom's heart it it lives gets hit by
creep
so it's possible mom's heart will get
hit by creep as well
kate your husband is about to break the
world record for
best isaac player
you're about why
you you know what that is that's that's
the competing
uh the competing desire of mom and dad
i always want food and then
when i uh oh she's she's bringing her in
here
i was i was wondering where my my cold
air went

oh my gosh she just babbled appa but
then the
subscribe emo covered her face oh no she
just said her first word it was uh
it was pog
i've already uh i've said it at the
start of this run
pardon me but i've been i've been very
clear about
roddenhart has appeared in the basement
the only reason there is so much uh
isaac content today is because of the
generosity of my wife
foregoing our normal morning routine
in order to uh give me some extra space
to get some isaac content out there so
make sure if you're enjoying the content
that is now and also to come you say
thank you kate
why stop there subscribe okay you know
see oh to kate's channel okay that's
that's one way to do it
you'll have you're going to stream
tonight right you know what you're going
to play
not isaac okay confirmed if you're one
of the people here that is uh
not a fan of isaac then uh
later tonight you can watch kate play uh
whatever she's gonna play nan she'll
she'll be the only
channel on twitch playing not isaac not
outriders
and not uh among us
years old tonight now come on it's hey
is that
this game is actually seven years old
come on
it's not like our baby's birthday is the
same
that is true i can't believe she
actually she told her husband to get a
life
savage classic bougie
ratchet oh you know that
i think it's meg the stallion
i know it from tick tock if she's
behaving so well
you can feed the baby here if you want
like i'm not
i mean i'm not gonna tell you no
i'm i'm sure people would be interested
i don't i
i'm gonna be honest with you guys i
don't think i can take bob's brain
we already have like enough uh
we got enough problems here
i don't think i can do it what are you
bonking for
i don't understand what people are
bonking for
not everything's horny just because
you're horny
okay i'm a fool i should not have stood
there and now they want me to take bob's
brain
skip
she likes it are these the green beans
oh
i told this the story in my episode
today
where i was like i told the story a few
days ago where my
my wife uh told me to go buy green beans
at the grocery store and then when i
came back she's like what are these
and i was like green beans and then
she's like oh i needed edamame
and then the story got even more
developed last night
because she opened up the baby cookbook
and is like see why do these green beans
look so weird whereas the ones in the
book look like so big
and i was like you know my wife those
are uh
those are peas
not even come on don't stop taking the
damage here
i guess the korean description was green
beans but
it is so good
so we we wasted well let's not say
wasted because we did get some food out
of it but
oh hold on hold on some spider bombs
um we did uh spend like half
an hour slicing open the green beans and
then
taking the individual like nanometer
sized green beans out of the pods
and we were like it's gonna it's gonna
take so long for us to like fill up this
bowl with these tiny green beans
it turns out it's because they should
have been peas the whole time
which actually are quite large
especially
they are they are similar for sure
i think peas are a type of bean that's
my guess
okay what the heck what the heck is this
chimera
again i feel like in another life i have
seen you but i don't remember what it is
you do
oh god but dude we're gonna win this run
i don't know how deep this goes
we'll see how deep the rabbit hole goes
oh oh oh
what a shot whatever dude do you think i
care about missing a deal with the devil
because i don't that much
we don't love to see it unfortunately
we're going to be moving on here
we good on hp we're good on hp we've
been to both secret rooms yeah
get me out of here take a little bit of
the bubbly
hey look at that you don't need to hold
that up that's uh
you know we we run the risk of
alienating some people i think in
in that department but i i am happy for
her
i am just going to leave this room i i
do not like these enemies
answer the door what the heck's going on
okay well
baby you doing okay who dares knock on
our door
like during the repentance launch stream
dude what if it was admin that'd be
pretty
sick
who was it science and sinners
final fantasy 14 the new ost hot
drop the new hot ost
from final fantasy 14. hey hey kate hey
kate
hey kate isn't that game like seven
years old
i think so wouldn't you be thinking that
perhaps you
should at this point maybe in your own
words so to speak uh
can we say maybe get a life but
mmorpg i suppose i didn't think about
that
mmorpg is life you know what is in life
isaac no isaac isaac is life uh
i was gonna say the cake the cake is a
is a lie
got her
[Laughter]
got it roasted roasted by a true gamer
guy got your back got your back okay all
right
uh we've been live for like an hour
we're on the same run
and i'm killing it i'm i'm amazing
i think at this point like the best way
to
rotten hearts they give flies when you
lose them i think
um the best way to give out the smallest
amount of gift subs possible
is to just make every run last as long
as possible oh that cold air is mighty
nice thank you
oh that feels great
but what's your score where we're going
we don't need scores remember that one
only nerds will understand only 90s kids
will get that one
it's from a little movie called um the
karate kid
help i'm safe
little bubbly break
isaac versus mother broken heart sounds
like a father john misty song
what the okay everybody gets one
saved
no health bar dude
okay knife comes in knife goes out you
can't explain that that hurt that hurt
me okay she's doing quite a lot of
damage
mmm snakes
let's go good dodge good dodge she's got
another one coming in
good focus good focus that hurt that
hurt me
i i won oh lord
oh what the heck
okay save safe not safe at all
extremely dead
we have invincibility you should have
used it close
so close though
[Laughter]
that was a good run nonetheless of
course i'm going to give out some gift
subs
i'm a man of my word slash marker first
pardon me first run complete



i am going to
just do my best
to unlock the new character one pardon
me one of the two new characters
so we're not gonna take alt paths
we're just gonna just play it cool
this is a spicy room to start with
we're just gonna play it cool here it is
it's so bright now dude
it looks so bad now
it's never enough for you folks is it
gamma please crank it crank the gamma
you crank the gamma
150 are you insane 137 is the optimal
uh gamma level
something something 100 steak in a in a
single bite we're not a monolith
i kind of think it looks it looks sick
my personal take
it looks sick
i'm keeping it man i can see i can see
between the floorboards
it's a new texture pack
i can i can see under the floorboards i
gotta tell you
i think i just spoiled myself
all right i'll tell you what i'm gonna
i'm gonna lower the gamma
to 141.
there you go that that's as low as we're
getting
perfect what 141 and 3 8 please
permaban 24 hour ban
permanent
actually better i i'm gonna be honest
with you maybe my eyes are broken but i
don't notice a difference
at all it looks exactly the same to me
me either maybe we'll take it down to
like 136 real quick
i don't know
this room don't forget you're here
forever
there was a significant difference oh
really what was its p value then
under 0.05 i doubt it
all right before we fight this boss
we're going all the way back we didn't
get an item yet
it's dd mega doo doo value
it's a big floor man am i insane it
feels like the curses have
been a little bit uh more prolific thus
far
i feel like they've recently changed the
incidence rates and
the proc values of the uh of the curses
repeating of course
new hard mode does indeed increase curse
rate i'm gonna be honest ahead i don't
know if you're still here
i don't mean this to be to be negative
at all but uh
i i saw like two hours before midnight
you dropped like the change log
i opened it up and i was like i'm gonna
read this and then i saw how
tiny the scroll bar got like how much
you would have to scroll in order to
read the whole thing
and i went nah i just closed the tab and
i went to bed
i was like that's way too and then like
the first thing was like you know
they were all about like individual item
changes and stuff like that and i'm like
there's no way
like i'll leave that to purge purge
gaming
i'll do it live
okay static tears very strong item no
no question there
it is nice that you get the first shop
free now no doubt about that
it is also nice that they finally came
to their senses and and nerfed uh a
thame
and put it in the see that's the thing i
i just knew a thame was gonna get nerfed
i was so confident of it that i uh
i i put it in the tier where i thought
it belonged to begin with
if you really wanted to watch the world
burn you know what you would do now
is uh re-rank
all the items but make a theme higher
[Laughter]
now that's a good idea
now we're talking
okay we have keys we got speed is this
always a lockdown
believe that answers the question clip
farming
it actually isn't oh snake eater okay
here we go what the heck
double key room that wants another key
you said no alt path oh frick
you're absolutely right oh no my static
tears dude
whatever we'll we'll do the alt path
because we're the only reason we're on
the alt path
anyway is to get uh
the double items that we can get from
the mirror and then once we get the
mirror
we'll just bounce dude then then we're
out of here
all right that was a good uh good use of
our time there um
but it's fine ludo static tears we got
no problems
although static tears doesn't do
anything now that's just until we break
the synergy with another synergy
i called i called debate on ludovico
moving these enemies
ludovico knockback i sure hope somebody
got fired for that blunder
ludo is actually pretty sick early on i
i got no complaints about that
except for the aforementioned knockback
so the mirror will be on the next floor
oh man these bosses are a little spicy
though
they can be a little spicy
i can smell that first win though you
smell that
that's victory
who farted good one why didn't i think
of that oh wait i did
i didn't i didn't know it was your how
dare you break win before me i didn't
know it was i'm sorry baby i didn't know
it was your turn
okay the easiest enemy of all time all
you do is
keep the crosshair on them and then walk
around in a circle
and then occasionally get hit but that's
fine
just just to make everybody else out
there feel better about getting hit
themselves
doubters be gone look at this easy win
easy hp down to the next floor feeling
pretty good
hp is precious man like there's there's
been times in my life i've insulted the
item a little bit
or the the stat you know the better you
get at the game the less
relative value hp has but obviously
you know with the new expansion dropping
times are a little tougher now
very happy to have as much hp as they'll
give me
what's up with the little ghosts oh come
on man what's up with the little ghosts
on the floor
i don't know if they're related to
anything but you know
it's the same as uh oh hello
like even when when like wrath of the
lamb came out there were all sorts of
crazy like conspiracy theories that
seemed comical in in hindsight
there's a room that has like the the
crest of belisle on the ground
in open flames um
i my brain can't do it it can't be done
uh and everybody was convinced that like
if you
use uh the book of belial
in the room with the belial crest
something crazy's got to happen and then
what actually happened is just you just
wasted your book of belial charge
because there's no enemies in the room
it was a good idea don't get me wrong
that would have been pretty cool
hagalaz gotta think about that okay okay
new dukka flies
realize realize real lies
duke of flies
squammy squam squammy swam
you know what you could use a little bit
of that
saved no
we were doing so well okay i think we're
done with the alt path temporarily
this run has a lot of lacking
we'll farm up the mirrors and then see
uh see what the the rest of the world
looks like
new worm just dropped
earthworms been real quiet since this
one came out
you know it'd be cool if you added like
a few more enemies into the game that do
like that monstro attack this impossible
to
freaking tell where the shots are gonna
land
i'm just salty i got hit yo what's up
with the blood door
i think i speak for the rest of twitch
when i say um
oh that's the sack room okay
sweep
i can't believe i didn't get hit i
deserve to i deserve to get hit there's
no question
oh am i hold on my brain's starting to
piece things together after
after an embarrassing length of time so
the alt floor
maybe always has the double item rooms
it always has like the bonus uh
question mark possibility that's cool
i thought it would just showed up either
always or randomly
okay so i gotta i gotta think for a
moment all right i need to find the uh
the white fire
and then i've gotta remember that when i
take damage i get
uh a tears upgrade and a tears upgrade
is
quite valuable
yeah we can make something happen here
you know i gotta cop that double item
room yes sir
this sounds like john bryan's original
soundtrack for eternal sunshine of the
spotless mind
real ones no
good i'm dead i'm alive because i'm
lazarus
but we can't unlock the the special
character now
which means i've got to go on the alt
path
because otherwise we got nothing to gain
man and when you ain't got nothing you
got nothing to lose
all right believers you're in i'll
probably actually just die right here
but believers times are tough if we make
it out of this
remember remember if you were a believer
nobody thought you had it in you
nobody thought nobody in the history
ever thought that this day would ever
end well guess what
it's never gonna end okay
okay hp please hp
the only thing i'm disappointed with is
the fact that we died in the minus realm
so by dying in the minus realm we didn't
get
our bonus um rate of fire ups
which is very disappointing but and then
we need the key piece that's
it just the key piece
no i dude i don't think we can take the
alt path i think i need to see what
what victory looks like
i mean also we don't have enough bombs
right now but
we're kind of in a tough spot here
it's a bit tricky
gotta go alt tell me you're a doubter
without telling me you're a doubter
yes sir gotta go the alt path coward
coward
egg lost his loss to zayn lost to zayn
you've changed man yes sir
empty shops
nothing in the putts all right well
we're going down to
we're going back to the non-minus realm
but i like i mean you can you can
say all the yes sirs you want to say
we can't go on the alt path if we only
have one bomb
we're stuck now if you could
inform me as to the location of the shop
we could maybe change that but
yeah i think we're uh i think we're
stuck
it's somewhere around there it is
there's no bomb for sale but there is
a sack the sac gave us a single key
honestly one of the greatest uh rip-offs
of
all time that's terrible
and two bombs it did give us a but
you're absolutely right
let's go doubters we're riding
we sucked up the bomb so fast oh and the
spirit hard wait that wasn't bad at all
doubters we ride at dawn
for the youtube audience a doubter is uh
someone who used their channel points to
bet on this being
uh a loss a believer
conversely is somebody who bet on this
run being a victory
okay the world is a vampire of course
we've said it many times before we'll
say it again
we're taking a question mark here
because the question mark could be
anything it could even be a mom item
takes a bit a little low-key
slap in the face i do see a library
though
and a library has a lot of value
i forgot what was happening oh loki is
actually
amazing because it works
with our uh with our static tears
okay okay so there's a chance here
the pog knows no bounce
i'm not even like aiming at anything i'm
just trying to get the static to hit
enemies but this is like
it's a bit messy no doubt
some survivability would would go a long
long way
so just throwing out there like it
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
if you would just
give me like the first damage upgrade
i've ever received
in my entire repentance history i knew
it too i knew it i was like just put me
in a safe spot come on man
they can't be dodged okay no doubters
not today not this room just one more
room
one more room can of corn and i'll be
all right can a corn
single key please a single key so we can
access the library
just chill let's chill we're chilling
not much dog what's up with you
lots of bombs single key please
yo they do be moving quick how did i get
hit by you before that's so embarrassing
all you do is
like move a little help
he's getting a little close yep okay you
got me
you got that's a tough one man
you know how it is yes sir pay out the
doubters we're going to run this one
back real quick
it is what it is i'm i'm a man of my
word
sir pay out the doubt that was the chat
took so long
to load that when i hit the mute button
it didn't actually mute tell me you're
muted without telling me you're muted
pay him
there they go all right now what happens
is this is
this is how good believers turn toxic
we're gonna unlock this character now
people that believed
the last two times
are gonna be doubters and then i'm gonna
win and they're gonna be like now it's
time to become the joker
it's this is how young gamers get
radicalized in twitch chat
you know i just wrote a blog post about
this this is like why i hate video
games they're the ultimate male power
fantasy
tough times never last
only tough people last
sorry once per stream i can do it once
per stream
and that's like mercy because i think
about it constantly
what is not always a lockdown
sometimes it's a shot speed up which is
almost as bad
golden bombs now we're talking
five joke andy imagine uh
making fun of someone's breathtaking
originality and humor
while simultaneously appending andy to
the end of your sentiment
like come on man try harder
the average egg enjoyer versus the uh
soy jack andy rider
what you should do is make a meme that's
like nl deciding which of his two jokes
to use
and then it's the guy in the spaceship
that's like patting his forehead
and then one button is like tough times
never last tough people last
and then the other button is like
see that would get me going that that
would get the memes started
i'm a germa fan you gremlin i don't know
what that means
you you're gonna insult me speak english
okay
otherwise how am i supposed to be
offended
also i'm not a gremlin you have me
confused with natsuki from
doki doki literature club
i'm not a cat we don't want that
spoilers
30 million in total on this bet yes sir
sorry
tell me you're a believer without
telling me you're a believer how do you
have 30
no 30 million total okay because i was
like if you have 30 million channel
points
you shouldn't have uh said it
because if i ever bring back channel
point rewards
which is on the fence um
now i have to set the minimum at like
you know 10 million
like i'm a match three indie game or
something like that
demco just signed a five-year extension
rip in chat for demko five more years
getting
lit up on the thing because the canucks
have a swiss cheese defense
f f for demko
ripped for demco and chat just kidding
god love him thanks thanks thatcher
looking forward to it
who i'm stupid
whatever easy wins no not stupid built
different
now we're talking okay we're not doing
alt pat this time all path is for
cowards
we're not doing alt path we have to
unlock the new character bethany
you know any bethany's in real life i
knew one
she was on my robotics team in eighth
grade
and also i forgot you know i've told
this
this is deep lore i've told this story
before but like every year
at the school talent show um
there was a a duet of two young ladies
who always sang
that terrible christmas song christmas
shoes
guys can i buy these shoes for my mama
please
as just christmas even these shoes are
just her size
but then the store owner is like uh
actually uh you're 25 cents short so can
you put those back on the shelf
but then a nice the nicest person you'll
ever meet was like
i'll donate 26 cents to save your mom
daddy says there's not much time and and
his name
albert einstein anyway long story short
uh
bethany was one of the two ladies who
sang that song
every year and every year it made like
the same four teachers cry
that's it i mean she's a pretty nice
lady i got nothing against her
but i was pretty damn sick of the song
but you know that's fine
no she was a pretty good singer i just
think like her taste in music could use
some work but
like if she got up there and she started
singing like you know debaser by the
pixies i would have been like all
pog but you know
she wasn't ready for that it's a lot of
familiars in this game huh
what'd you do at the talent show
freaking watched in the audience
streaming hadn't been invented yet so
you know wrong place wrong time
people were like this guy is really
funny but like you can't just
you don't want to get up on stage and do
stand-up comedy in high school you know
all your jokes are going to go over
their heads
most popular comedian back then was dane
cook
i can't compete with that dude's hopped
up on touring
we're actually like this this feels like
i'm i'm cheating right now like i'm
playing default isaac
so i'm very tempted to take the alt path
i gotta be honest i'm very tempted to
take the alt path
but they didn't give me anything too
great here
so you know what i'm just gonna master
diagonal walking and i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna risk it too much we think
about bethany yeah the christmas shoes
think about the christmas shoes
okay the master of diagonal walking has
logged on
papanada this is the most um
i've ever seen conjoined in my entire
life it's it's crazy
do it for her and her is like the mental
picture that i have of
of bethany who i have not seen in
literally like
17 years
i'm so much in chat it's big
text deleted by moobot banned unbanned
like they you just got hit with like all
the infinity stones simultaneously
uh you're probably dizzy right now
sorry i missed clicked it's no problem
it's not i was going through apollo's uh
band requests or unban requests uh
earlier today
makes duty zombie juice
it makes me laugh every time man
it's just they're just such weird bands
like
a couple days ago somebody got banned
from his chat they just kept typing dumb
dog harem over and over
with no context dumb dog harem dumb dog
harem dumb dog harem
and then like they got banned and they
wrote an essay in the replies that's
like i'm sorry
i know now that what i did was not okay
but i just thought lol it'd be funny and
you're like what are you
talking about man like
people be crazy i mean maybe with the
context from the stream is not so bad i
don't know
no like i'm not trying to invite this
you got to try a little harder than that
to get banned here
we have up to the bands a little bit
just because you know i've finally given
myself permission to ban the
uh known quantities who come around to
just try to start arguments all the time
but even still we're trying like a
couple people a week
really get get permit here a couple of
people a week that are like real human
beings and not just like ascii art
i keep the mfn thing on me precisely
true
uh he's not taking any bs anymore
but i i think it's because like for
other streamers like what annoys them is
when people are rude
for me like the thing that i'll like the
cardinal sin for my
chat is when they make a joke that's
like funnier than the joke i made
and i'm like oh you think you're really
funny let's see how funny you are when
you can't talk
because i think that's hilarious what do
you think oh
silence oh cat guy your tongue
freaking buttholes man should think of
that before you
before you try making jokes in here
you look like a very huggable person
yeah i haven't been to the gym
uh since kovid broke out really so
i'm you know i'm not working on it but
it's like on the list of things to
to work on once once i get vaccinated in
freaking like 2027 or whenever like i
know i don't even know what's going to
be the limiting
factor for vaccination for me if it's
going to be that
i'm last in line because uh you know i'm
only 32
or if it's gonna be that like we don't
get the shipments or like the shipments
uh they keep putting them on paws for
you know like
concerns or if the bc government is just
never gonna actually hire
um web developers to make their websites
they keep crashing
uh or just being non-functional uh due
to the amount of traffic they're
receiving so
i don't know one of these days like is
is happening man but it's gonna be a bit
i'm just saying they need to hire like
some more bcit grads and a few less
uh sfu grads they if they get some bcit
grads in there they're gonna sort that
out right away
my points you're losing me my jury
he went off oh he's saying it
what was your lifting routine i did um
i did five three one uh
boring but big i would recommend it like
it's it's very simple
it's it's good for for building you know
strength and
and mass as long as you eat properly and
it's not like
one of the things i liked about it the
most is that it's like uncomplicated
like instead of uh you know there's
things i i forget now i was like
way into it i free there's like a
there's a reddit user
who was like really jacked and he made a
um like a plan
for basically how to get that jacked and
sons that's
it see i told you i know just enough to
to know what i don't know
i remember like looking at uh the plan
and it was like literally like when you
have like bench day
you do like 27 sets of bench pressing or
something like that i'm just like man
i can't do that that's that
that's that's for somebody that's in a
different place in their life
which is fine don't get me wrong you
know you got trade-offs uh
one way or the other 531
was that like it was at a great level
for me of
easy to follow and and showed good
results
without you know requiring too long in
the gym
i did like a three-day split so like
i would do i think i did squats
and overhead press on the same day and
then like
bench had its own day
trying now i'm like i'm way out of it
man and and deadlifting had his own day
um and the longest workout day was like
90 minutes
but it's not so bad it's it's much
better than
well much easier at least than than the
like 120 minute minimums
that's we're honest i did five by five
that's right i didn't do five three one
never mind you're absolutely right i did
five
yeah no wait oh hold on i did
five by five and then i
pivoted to five three one yeah
because i i read online i don't know how
true it is
um but i was i had done like two months
of
strong lives five by five and then uh i
read online that uh
dead lifting heavy three times a week
could cause like a compressed vertebrae
and i was like
you know what get me out of that
let's see look i i want to get in shape
but not at that cost
anyway yeah yeah it does it turns out it
does both
but anyway that's that's a long time ago
now i work out at the library
uh where i read the wall street journal
could you take some damage please
doubters have been real quiet you hate
to see it right
like i'm almost like oh oh snooze
another another win
i could use some damage though we are at
2.8 damage that's that's a little on the
low side
winds are good for morale though people
are like obvious wins resident sleeper
bro i have 2.8 damage
yeah but wow the food here is terrible
yeah what smaller portions as well
are conjoined is like is terrible
what's your fire rate yeah i haven't
learned how to like contextualize that
now because it goes from low to high
instead of high to low now
i don't know what happened the doors
just opened up because i took too long
oh let's go it's something it's not
it it's good quality of life very
helpful
that's shots per second now like like
tails from
sonic the hedgehog by the way did you
know
sonic the hedgehog too i don't mean to
flex
filming right now in downtown vancouver
you guys want anything
to say i i can pass on a message maybe
to sonic or to james marsden
i uh no spoilers i haven't seen the
first one so i don't know if james
marsden dies in the first one
do you know jim carrey yeah we we hang
out at the same
uh facebook groups
dude that's absolutely don't even talk
to me about jim carrey i'm gonna be so
cheesed if he gets vaccinated before me
i'll never recover man like
psychologically physically i'll probably
be fine but
get ready you're gonna be upset no no no
well no i'd rather he be vaccinated
but you know i still think i mean it's
hard right like it's hard to
not see the vaccine as like a reward for
good behavior
like that's i'm like we would we did
everything right
where's our vaccine and they're like nah
the people who
you know kind of screwed it up are going
to get vaccinated first and i'm like
that makes perfect sense but i'm still
mad okay this is
eye drops tier size plus range up
okay okay
okay now down to the next floor please
minor pog
nope i refuse i refuse to take damage
here
i got vaccinated by the astrazeneca
vaccine and then they banded 30 minutes
later in my country
it's all right cause i'm saved by the
bell
when i wake up in the morning get the
alarm clock morning and you know i'm
gonna make it on time
i see the bus fly by it's sorry
sorry um it's a 24-hour ban
permanent
there's little batteries now they didn't
nerf batteries there's there's little
batteries and normal size batteries
it's all right to be a little bitty
little bitty town versus big old city
might as well sing might as well smile
life goes on for a little bitty while
randy travis
look it up sweetheart country music has
an anti-city agenda
it's actually alan jackson it might be
might be randy jackson
like little bitty town versus big old
city i know what i would choose
um but then also um
don't even get me started on on allen
jackson's gone country
the whole song is basically about how
like you know
if you live in those uh big cities like
get ready because people are gonna like
break into your house and like steal
your things but as soon as you
move to a city with like six people in
it your life's gonna be totally fine
i believe i i think there might be a
line now that i think of i think there
might be a line
in gone country about how las vegas is
full of sinners just give me one sec
okay hold on gone country
lyrics this by the way if you're new
here this is typical we do this
we do this uh from time to time
give it a sec give it give it a sec hold
on
he commutes to la but he's got a house
in the valley but the bills are piling
up and the pop
scene just ain't on the rally and he
says honey i'm a serious composer
schooled in voice and composition but
with the crime and the smog
these days this ain't no place for
children
i hate it so much oh man
that being said she's been playing a
room on the strip for 10 years in vegas
every night she looks in the mirror
and she only ages doesn't even rhyme
she's been reading about nashville
the old records everybody's buying says
i'm a simple girl myself
grew up on long island she's gone
country
i hate it man anyway it wasn't as bad as
i thought it was but
small town girl she grew up on long
island you know in like the third most
populous u.s state
no big deal nashville by the way real
small town
uh uh uh uh but we listen to country
music there so it's the country
quick quick guess population size of
nashville
900 000 in the in the metro area
confirmed or denied
i mean in the city proper not in the
metro area
700 000 back on top
sad couldn't even be bigger than
vancouver if i wanted to go country i'd
live to your largest city
how does that make you feel be nice to
get out of the hustle bustle
sorry it's too far i have nothing
against nashville
now new orleans we don't speak about
that
and you see how seamlessly we slipped
back into banter now that we're on a
guaranteed one run
oh man
everybody likes new orleans i have never
been in new orleans
incredible history of course um
my parents have been in new orleans and
they said they did not really enjoy
themselves
um because bourbon street
smelled like you know fluids
and biohazard stains and stuff like that
um
and then the other reason i have a
prejudice against it is because
the worst person in 90 day fiance
history is from
new orleans but apart from that i got
nothing against it
except isn't that the place where the
hotel just fell down
okay doubters have been real quiet
didn't like a big hotel just fall over
in new orleans in like 2017 or something
like that
that happens everywhere
i i don't think so
because then it wouldn't be news it
would be in the periodicals
the front fell off
look if you're into jazz or fried shrimp
sandwiches
both of which by the way appeal to me
go go see tiny boop squig shorterly
live at the house of blues dan aykroyd
opens
just take away the mic when he starts
talking about alien technology
what the this seems pretty good
right new character about to be unlocked
i'm not even looking at i'm glancing the
whole time can we talk about 90 days
no i haven't been watching this much of
this season
um i catch it every now and then when i
like you know i'm just chilling
i did see the i mean tlc they put out a
it was a fake season right like every
episode they were like i cannot be to
marry him
and then the next episode they're like
guess what we got married
sorry the show's always a little fake
but it was like
it was faker than usual from from what i
could glean from this season
i've seen some brandon clips dude i
brandon is who i was talking about like
a couple months ago when the season
started
i was laughing that he was talking uh
with his mom about how like he and his
fiance don't use contraception
and then like his mom made an
appointment at the doctor for
his fiancee to get some birth control uh
and he was just in the back of the car
on the drive there playing his nintendo
switch
come on man
you're setting gamers back like like 30
years with this portrayal
like you're you're you're a 26 year old
adult you're about to get married and
mom made your doctor's appointment for
your fiance and is driving her to the
the doctor's office while you're playing
animal crossing back there
you're not ready to have a kid man
oh it's true it was like february 2020
so it's not uh
it was not animal crossing he's probably
playing breath of the wild
he's probably a speed runner
[Laughter]
anyway they got married because you know
every episode you know
they have a huge problem i don't know if
the wedding's gonna happen next episode
we're married
i mean i guess that's what happens when
you only have 90 days right like if you
if you have like a big argument it's not
like you can really put it off
i do feel like a couple of the couples
got a little screwed like
because like they had major fights but
it was in the middle of like the first
coveted lockdown so they're like you
can't even leave
so like your only options were like get
married or go to jail
which is you know
it's a tough decision i guess
i think some of them made the wrong one
but
the show is called 90 day fiance it's uh
must watch television it was recently
ranked by tv guide as the best show in
television history
much better than one piece or my hero
academia
or uh a tank on titan the final season
really for real this time
we promise pinky swear unless the
ratings are good
no deal with the devil this is what dude
it's a long run or maybe i'm just
i've been streaming for a while that's
possible too
could not be more wrong wait a minute
hold on this appeals to me
24-hour ban permanent have you seen
marriage or mortgage i have not
but this sounds like a show that might
be a little bit up my alley
that show is great hold on hold on
marriage or mortgage tv program
how much of the show's actually scripted
a wedding planner and a real estate
agent
compete to win the hearts and budgets of
couples who must
choose between a fairytale wedding and a
dream home
so is oh but they're real couples
so it's not like because what i was
thinking
was like it was like the bachelor but at
the end of the show
the guy could choose the girl
or the house and i was like that guy's
getting some equity
yeah wait a minute hold on why would you
ever
and i understand where i'm going with
this like just work with me for a second
if you get the choice between your dream
home and your dream wedding
and you don't snap pick
the dream home you are a fool they're
not giving out
homes for a hundred bucks down at city
hall
you know these are not two life events
that are created equal in terms of the
financial cost
they still have to pay for the home what
is then what is the
what's the show
i don't assume they would give them a
house they give them a five percent down
payment
and closing costs okay like that's not
nothing
but i can't help but feel like they
couldn't even up it to 20
like the they're literally taking
advantage of like the you know lowest
interest rates in human history they
give you the 5
down payment and the maximum monthly
mortgage payment that's
insane
there you go just just choose a billion
dollar home yeah you could just live in
notch's house
with the candy room and everything
okay hold on the emperor card
doubters are on notice right now
we finish this floor
we beat both bosses we use the emperor
card
we finish the cathedral instantly we go
to the chest
and we get a good item and then we win
the run it's that simple
bethany i can already see you you're a
fine girl
what a good run you would be
we have an orbital emperor is still
better though
i can't read the comment but it's it
seems to explain some of the k
fabe with um
with marriage or mortgage i didn't know
this was on netflix like i
i have been pretty hard on netflix
recently
i might give one episode of uh
of marriage or mortgage a chance
i'll give it a shot
it's not like there's anything else what
are they making the kings gambit
i don't think so
you'll get mad that's for sure i mean
that's pretty much what i'm looking for
i i have indeed seen the some of the
american seasons of uh
married at first sight i think sips was
talking about it on
on monday it's a it's a truly
like flabbergasting show
it's you know like how on
we used to rag on tiny house shows
because you know they'd be like i want
to live in a tiny house and then when
every house they got shown they'd be
like it's a little tight
in here yeah yeah i want a tiny house uh
but by the way i also want to have a
full king-sized california bed
and you're like can't be done it's got
everything i'm looking for but it
doesn't have my california king bed
that's because it's a tiny house madam
we we couldn't figure tennis courts in
here either i'm sorry to tell you but
um it's married at first sight is kind
of like that
where like they're so gleefully ignorant
they're like why doesn't everybody just
get married like on a tv show at first
sight without even knowing
like anything about the person they're
gonna get married to it's so easy
forehead and then like a week later
they're like i hate you
and i never wanna see you again
like there's they're always so confident
that they've made the right decision
and like everybody else is a dummy and
then they have like one
argument and they're like i want you to
die and i'm like that's why most people
don't
like actively pursue marrying a stranger
on television dummy
i love it when the friends are roasting
the spouse
is just it's a bad dynamic for sure i
mean like
why do you think people put so much you
know care and work and time into
choosing their
spouse you know it's if you could just
like walk into the store and then you
know
be like oh you know what can i do i'm
just looking for anything you know
it's just crazy
government mandated spouse i mean it's
just crazy man
don't even get me started i had to i
raged quit it doesn't happen that much
because i i love watching tv shows that
make me mad
the television program on netflix uh
indian matchmaking made me so mad i
couldn't watch it anymore
like i can tolerate watching almost
anything
and like we finished one episode of that
and then
we just let a second one autoplay and i
was like i hate this
and then we almost let it like kate
didn't pick up the remote after the
second episode
so it started playing and i was like if
you don't mind i'm going to turn this
off cause i hate it
like it's i'm not normally that strong
with my diction
but i was like it just
so many of the ladies on that show were
were like
they were so rude like it was too much
for me
there's one lady on the show i forget
her name but her
brain is like her dialogue is seared
into my brain
i think she was named like aparna or
something like that
and she was going out on these cool
dates with these guys who were like you
know
really trying their hardest and had
things like go they had they were
professionals and
stuff like that and then like the one
guy was a podcaster
and uh she was like you know i don't
really respect him i
don't think i could respect a man that
like he works at a job like that
i was like what the hell are you talking
i looked him up on twitter
he had like you know 60 000 followers on
twitter or something like that
and he was just laying into her like
nicely
but you know it was she was terrible man
the show made me so upset
and it wasn't like inconsolable but i
was just like i
don't wish this lady the best i don't
wish her the worst but i certainly do
not actively give her my well wishes
no it's not on site on site i would like
you know i would be like oh hey that's
that
nasty lady from uh indian matchmaking
let's cross the street she's my lawyer
and she's not very friendly in real life
either how did that
happen
but isn't that that's kind of what you
want out of a lawyer right
well i don't know is are you are you
being charged with the crime or are you
taking someone to small claims court
if you've been charged with a crime i
don't know if that's the energy you want
but if you're trying to
extort a local business maybe
i mean i don't again like and this
sounds rude right like
but i don't really care if she's nice as
a lawyer but like when she's like going
on blind dates
and also wondering like why she's still
single despite being like
you know a woman in her mid-30s with a
stable career
i'm like you know maybe you should turn
the lens of introspection on
for a second and realize that you're
based on the tv show you're just kind of
unpleasant to be around quite frankly
because your standards are so high
versus like what you're bringing to the
table
you've unlocked bethany he's done it
some
dude we should do some challenges on
this stream too i just ignored the deal
with the devil
not not a wise play but
rise up believers
anyway that's oh new new animation um
it's a pretty cool item now
hold on i just realized that all of our
familiars have become orbitals thanks to
friend necklace
that's actually pretty sweet
anyway long story short that's like one
of the only shows of my life i've ever
i've ever raged quit
otherwise when a show like makes me mad
i usually feel good
it's like a release
that one though i was just like they
should cancel the series because this
lady's just
she's just too rude
horse only has two charges it's a dream
come true
i hate all that did i tell you i
understand
i mean i don't know do you call me a
homeowner i am making payments on a home
but
the vast majority of it still belongs to
the bank but um
either way you know it's i don't know if
that's does a homeowner own their house
or is it just someone who's working to
own their house anyway solidarity or
whatever
um but there's this show i for it's on
hgt
tv and it takes place in the south i
don't remember what the name of it is
it's called
like simple home or something like that
sweet home
and i just remember being like so mad
while i was watching it because they did
this episode where like these two
brothers
hometown that's it these two brothers
we're like hey we wanna like buy a new
location for our restaurant
oh you're still alive and then
she showed them like two different
places and then they were like okay
which one are you gonna get
and then they said we've decided and
then they went to a commercial break
then they came back
recapped and we're like we've decided to
just
buy both of them and i i turned it off
because i was like quit bragging
now that's a room right there
i was watching to see if you were gonna
go with the
the oh the old colonial house that's a
little bit of a fixer-upper but it's in
a nice part of town or if you were going
to go with the ultra modern
open kitchen concept and instead you're
like oh we've decided to just buy both
because you know money's no object
you you remove the conceit
just by both forehead
just uh be dead not not the guys i mean
this enemy
i need you to be dead so that i can win
this run and play as the new character
i'm trying to be rich and frivolous one
of these days i mean it's ambitious
don't get me wrong
it's just on tv on a tv show like
that like
you know i mean hgtv is just kind of
like it's in a weird spot
for me right like i can't pretend like
that i'd
you know i'm like living out of a
shoebox or whatever but at the same time
i'm like
you know the housing crisis is one of
the eminent issues facing my generation
and then hgtv
is like we like them both so we just we
just decided to like buy both of them
and then like take double the supply
necessary off the
off the uh market just just because i
like them just because like i think i
i really like the the awning on this one
is really good and then the other one
seems nice to live in
anyway
it's their right don't get me wrong
they're not doing anything like
illegal just kind of like you know kind
of like be quiet about it just think
they're neat
were they in vancouver no they wish
sorry that was really though like
look screw that man
pinky eye we'll take it
they they'd gone country let's put it
that way
there was an episode of of i don't
remember if it was loved or listed
or if it was house hunters but there was
an episode of
house hunters or love it or listed
vancouver that had a streamer on it
i am not joking because my mom watches
all those shows
she was like she took a photo of her tv
set this was like five years ago
and was like check it out there's a
streamer on here
no it was not me um
but it was like an an og streamer
youtuber it was
i think it was oh what's his name
i think it was justra
who i think lives in vancouver
i think he like he's involved with
monster cat as well like he might be uh
like a co-founder of monster cat or
something like that
i was like that's a little spicy man
you're a streamer and you're like
they're showing photos of your house on
the television
then again i think the the overlap
between like
internet trolls and uh people that watch
hgtv is probably a little on the low
side
i imagine
no i didn't i've never seen the episode
my mom watched it though
well you know next time i i see my mom
i'll ask her i'll be like hey
what else did they end up going with on
that show and they'll be like
he bought both and i'll be like
put the cookie down
how long is a long run man i mean i've
heard of long
runs before but this run is long i'll
tell you
i never get no respect this run is so
long
it's it it it's so long if you
ran it you would have run a marathon and
never get any respect
sorry sorry i gotta work on the punch
line a little bit
where's the boss dude
i'm i'm a big fan of two charge white
pony no no doubt about that
you know what i uh miss
i miss when the food network with shows
where people cooked but they weren't in
competition with one another
like when they used they used to have a
show i mean jamie oliver
was one of them obviously as well and
you know but like
you know giada at home nigella lawson at
home etc etc
now they're always fighting man i
thought food was supposed to bring us
together
donkey donkey dunky dunky we've won
uh slash marker repentance



all right new character new year new me
what the heck does the book of virtues
do
she gets a cool little fly followed by a
cool little fly
wait a minute was this uh
character in
she gets the spirit hearts and the
spirit hearts
become flies because she can't actually
get hp
okay i recall now but that was it like
double tap
shoots fire or am i now i'm getting it
confused with like fiend folio or
something like that
the bones are her money and so are the
fires
not your tinnitus by the way that this
is uh is merely the sound of the vacuum
cleaner
three bombs how come your mom lets you
have three bombs
they pull your hair up but not out
to turn into a man and have another
chance at life
but i love the sauce he puts on the end
of it man
but if they pull it out they turn to
bones
oh
how does one bet he's losing this one
for sure
it's a hot tip it's a sure thing
yeah that's i'll use netflix again
when they uh put out i think you should
leave season two man
they've really been dragging their heels
because like it hadn't been completed
yet
lazy
not a good use of a bomb for the record
by the way i'll tell you right off the
bat i don't think we're doing um
alt path we'll see what our first items
are but
this seems a little weak right off the
bat
but if we get the relic
dude that would be sick i would do some
fortnite duos with tim robinson
i think tim robinson could see the humor
in the alien xenomorph
from uh ridley scott's 1977
sci-fi thriller alien doing uh
the turk dance from scrubs i think
uh i think he would find that hilarious
have you seen this it's hilarious
it said it was uploaded at 6am today it
has one view
have you seen it
it's actually from 1979 you appear to
have it confused with the smashing
pumpkin song
of the same year
he's done it okay
speed not what i'm looking for
not what i'm looking for come on man
no bet because i forgot
current poll one run you i'll
uh you know it might compromise the
integrity of the bet but you you could
reopen the tables if you want
i would allow it it's uh you know you're
early here
don't steal my charge man
this is not gonna compromise the
integrity too much
oh i just realized if we win as this
character we're gonna get
new items unlocked right well probably
the book of virtues first but
we're back on the hunt
what's going on youtube we're back
hunting the book of virg using the
binding of isaac repentance
wow i don't know what this character
is australian children's pokemon go
youtuber i guess
is the character
something like that
look i never had a choice
that's not australian what are you
talking about i'm really feeling it
that's australian man
just because they're not presently
snowboarding
doesn't mean they're not australian
hey nl that's not cool australians do
lots of other things like
not just snowboarding uh they surf as
well
believers keep your wallet in your
pocket i'm not sure about this one right
now
well it's been a while since i
referenced that uh tick tock that i
stole from shibley
why cook saucies might win it
earth to do it for you mate
thank you for the hp much appreciated
it's so good
it's a great uh a great tick tock i
couldn't agree more
what the there's an an enemy remains
how much garbage juice is too much
garbage juice
toasty are you okay what is what does it
mean what does this mean how much
garbage juice is too much garbage juice
is it a reference to a tick tock i'm not
familiar with
what the what the
not sure i'm just feeding coal into the
banter engine
well i mean like any amount of garbage
juice is too much garbage juices like
garbage juice is like it's the liquid
garbage right we're not talking about
like when you mix a bunch of sodas
together at the kfc taco bell
any amount is too much i mean you
you successfully put banter into the
banter engine though i will promise you
that because
um like now i'm i can go off on a rant
about how like you know when you had
since we had the baby
i've been taking the garbage and this is
i know to skip the dishes bit but this
is real this is my real life man it's
not a joke
we've been taking the garbage and
recycling out like
i don't know six times a day
but between all the cans of sparkling
water and
and all the diapers like oh man
taking out a lot of garbage skipping the
dishes but
taking the garbage out twice a day i
really should just get a soda stream man
like i get all the the spiciness i
suppose but
you should probably just get a soda
stream yo believers rise up
turn your tears into bombs and rise up
like let me go through the the the
positives and negatives
positive of the soda stream
don't have to buy sparkling water as
often
negative of the soda stream
have to buy co2 cans occasionally
positive of the soda stream
i can buy the co2 canisters at
any uh major chain grocery store in
british columbia
negative of the sodastream i have to
resolve how i feel about the conflict
in the gaza strip apparently at least
that's what what twitch told me
positive uses a lot less aluminum than
the cans
from the bubbly
i don't know i'll have to think about it
negative
sodastream costs a lot more than a pack
of bubbly
positive maybe not in the long term
hear me out you could just drink water
from the tap uh and the nobel prize for
uh
things nobody ever thought of before
goes to your username in chat
come on man
the sponsorship though um that's true
this sponsorship though
oh so what you're saying is bubbly you
better act fast
yeah bubbly better act fast
otherwise i could be going going gone
yo thank you tree no tea
biggie not tree biggie that's groot
thank you for the gifted subs thank you
i don't know i have to think about it
the other thing is
the bubbly takes up a lot of space in
the fridge
however the soda stream would take up a
lot of space in the
on the counter and we got a real counter
based dearth of real estate right now
what a dodge
he's a genius like we got
an instant pot we got
uh the air fryer coffee grinder
baby food warmer upper
baby bottle warmer upper there's a lot
of stuff on the counter right now
counter space is at a serious premium i
might have to stick with the bubbly but
don't let them know that
rice cooker you're absolutely right we
also have a a hot water heater so we get
instantly dispensed
uh hot water for teas
counter is is quite full honestly the
counter doesn't even have space for the
toaster
i have to drag the toaster out from from
appliance jail every time i want to have
toast
he's done it okay don't die
it's it's easy to die on this one
because oh we didn't matter if we picked
it up i guess oh cause we're bethany
don't care didn't ask plus you're
bethany bethany
what's wrong with me that's what happens
when you stream for eight years
start calling it library i'm dead
i actually don't know what happened
you broke the mirror
is that bad
[Laughter]
all right
seven years bad luck all right
we were on such a good run too it is
what it is i should really just keep my
stream open in a tab
like we didn't i didn't have holy mantle
or did i have holy mantle i got hit and
i didn't notice or something
don't care didn't ask plus you're dead
gift five subs
you broke the mirror you can't
of leave
even though i still have two red hearts
makes perfect sense
yo new badge just dropped i got a sub
gifter badge
how about that
dodged no we we'll do challenges
eventually
we like within this stream but for now
we got to do
uh we got to get bethany work in here
man we got to do something
the first two challenges are bethany
challenges okay so i'll skip those
all right we're good to go
corey did you stay up until midnight to
play this
oh wait that's when you normally
eat breakfast probably
[Laughter]
got him what does bethany do not
uh much what's up with you
she uh every once in a while she takes
her spirit hearts and turns them into
blue dots that hit an enemy once and
then break
thank you to whoever just sent me a uh a
sodastream picture on twitch much
appreciated thank you for the sodastream
picture
on twitch or on twitter i should say it
is it is quite small
i can't dispute that i'm looking at it
out of my peripheral vision right now
it is not a large um
appliance but even still i got to tell
you we're very limited countertop
real estate right now we'll see
we'll see i got to think about it be the
best item in the game please
okay well jesus heard my pleas
and he has uh decided to
leave me on read but you know what that
could be worth something later
we'll see
i also think like to some extent i know
how this sounds
but i think having a
soda stream would lead to me drinking
too much sparkling water
like i probably drink too much sparkling
water as is
with the bubbly but uh
i think if i got a soda stream there's
no more artificial limits like i would
never run out of cans
right eventually run out of co2 but it
you know that doesn't have
the ratio of running out of co2 versus
cans is pretty low
i think i would i would drink too much
now i don't know if it's one of those
things where drinking too much sparkling
water has any ill effects
or if it's like a it's just a persistent
myth that people are like oh your bone
density is going to go down to like zero
dude
but i don't know
i don't know
it puts bubbles in your blood i don't i
don't think so
i don't believe that
well like i don't know now i'm thinking
about it and i'm like maybe
you got me craving some sparkling water
now though
it hurts my teeth um you know
that would be the other thing i'd be
worried about is that like because it's
acidic to some extent maybe it would
have like an impact on your dental
health
but i also have like a sonicare so i
feel like those should
cancel each other out you know
i feel like one sonicare should be worth
like four cans of bubbly a day
i don't know if that's true but
i i can't believe i'm gonna dignify this
with the response why not just drink
normal water
it's just like this the simple answer is
people you know they drink sparkling
water because they like the taste of it
you know
why why why ever eat like a real meal
when instead you could just have like
you know
five soylents a day why do anything
like just say you don't like sparkling
water and move on
yeah like i get it you don't like spicy
food
oh oh garcon this water is too spicy for
me could you just get me some out of the
bathroom sink
make sure it's room temperature please i
can't handle anything that's close to
the extremes of
heat or cold
can i get like six saltines with that as
well or maybe a digestive aero root
cookie
i get it if you're not cool enough to
drink sparkling water then you know
it is what it is it's an aspirational
thing maybe one day you'll get there you
can see me in the
in the halls of valhalla drinking some
bubbly
i feel vindicated dude i listen the
water lobby is like merciless i love
water i'm drinking out of like my my
nalgene right now
filled up to the brim with some ice
cubes in it just to stay frosty
if you ever drink a type of water that's
not tap water people
they'll hit you with like an essay they
found on reddit it's crazy man
i didn't realize the anti-sparkling
water lobby
like i get it if you drink whoever
drinks sparkling water in like high
school
they're so cool they're probably like
awes
everyone there's there's mr popular and
you you hate them because of the you
know you think it's the sparkling water
that makes them so popular
but it's not the sparkling water they
don't drink
the sparkling water didn't make them
cool they're just so cool they drink
sparkling water and
you know women want them and men want to
be them it's just what
that's the prototypical bubbly consumer
you know you can you can either be
jealous or you can
get with the times i don't know what to
tell you
saved believers rise up
we've done it
i don't know at all how to play as this
character
do you supplement with electrolytes
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
i eat food every day and i think that
that that gives me enough to
you know from an ion standpoint to
you know stay safe i guess
i don't know i've never i've never
gotten hypotonic to the best of my
knowledge
but i'll keep an eye out for it
it seems like kind of a high maintenance
way to go about consuming
liquid but but what do i know
oh first he's dead drinking sparkling
water now he's eating food
my god quit bragging
what's that were you gonna buy both
houses now that was a bit from last
episode if you're not
if you weren't there for it
i feel like blind rage now makes
the invincibility after getting hit
the length that it was before
repentance which is very good for my
muscle memory
okay the fool card the fool on the hill
still got it baby back on top
i've seen this item before in anti-birth
what do you do eyesore more eyes
realize realize real lies
jaw breaker don't chew it i don't know
man i don't know what i'm looking for
but it's kind of like bloodborne isaac
you're not wrong
now you know what we need tractor beam
clip farming
if we get tractor beam right now i'll
give out a million twitch subs
if we get tractor beam on this room
one million gifted twitch subs
incoming but it has to be on this room
i'm i'm putting it all on the line
oh this is a germ a bit oh stolen
i didn't know
you leave holes in the floor
very rude
i think this run has the potential like
i don't know what a good rate of fire is
now i feel like we're a little low
um but our damage is pretty good
we have a if we don't get hit we have a
100 chance of a deal with the devil
it's kind of a spicy enemy for sure to
not get hit on but
we're doing our darndest come on come on
come on come on
he's done it was the deal with the angel
what the heck staple gun
damage up nothing wrong with that
something not kind of wrong with this um
i mean i'm a
holy holy poop people like holy poop i'm
kind of a guardian angel guy but
this is an active item right what the
what what hold on hold on
we've created mom
so every is they've fused
i don't understand how this works but
we're about to find out
i was here
so we created a boss that's normal
but what happens now does does the boss
like
hang out no it's the sa i feel like it's
just the same item
is it okay hold on i thought that they
would do
something different but maybe it's
actually just that they allow you to
have the book
and the item simultaneously
it also still gives you the spirit fire
it's kind of you know i i thought it was
gonna make like
an orbital out of a boss and i was like
this is the greatest thing
ever
i was i was i had a whole speech
prepared for the believers
and then another one for the doubters in
case one of the bosses we summoned hit
us and like it was gonna be a whole
production
the fires also shoot tears
okay so we you what you're trying to say
is we shouldn't just be throwing them
away
as terrible orbitals i understand now
i i get the picture haha underwear i get
the picture
yeah yeah
hey dude why is the joker so popular
i'm so sorry i'm so sick of the joker
like why the he's been the most popular
villain
the entire time i've been alive
first it was you know i mean uh
cesar romero like back in the 60s but
i'm talking about like within my long
lifespan
cool glitter bombs what random blast
plus five bombs okay very interesting
like i i thought it would end at some
point you know we had like
jack nicholson and it was like really
popular okay and then it was like
animated joker and i was like okay cool
and then it was heath ledger and you're
like all right that's fine
and then there was a little break and
then they're like guess what it's jared
leto now and you're like oh come on
guys like it's just getting ridiculous
like the riddler needs some love
give the riddler some love now now we
got a joaquin phoenix as well like
there's like seven
jokers simultaneously just never ends
i bet you could chart like anything you
wanted on a graph
by just charting it versus
the number of
joker cosplays you can find on youtube
it's like a it's an exponential
growth upwards if you can chart anything
against that it will prove any trend
you're trying to prove
what happened to false face man false
face is pretty cool
he wears masks and rides a motorcycle
and doesn't afraid of anything except
sometimes batman
you mean two-face no i mean false face
from the original batman
television program starring adam west
he's a bad guy who wears masks
also known as false faces
clay face his name is false face you can
look it up on
batwiki wikibadia.com
no no no no no no
he really exists yeah i mean i make very
little up
occasionally you find yourself in a
banter hole you gotta you gotta pull a
rabbit out of a hat
most of these stories come from you know
the real world
and that's all that needs to be said
you're just big horn don't care didn't
ask plus your big horn
miss me with that okay oh so we got
am i insane or do we have like a tooth
shooting
familiar now is that what's going on
with the fires there i can't follow this
like this come on have mercy this is too
much
what's happening the whole screen is
covered
what are you trying to do to me here i
can't even see what the item is
what are you they stuck with me okay
happy to have you along for the ride
uh we will not be going alt path we'll
just be going down a floor
oh it's your trinket
the trinket creates the uh
the tooth shots that makes perfect sense
you ever have a jawbreaker man
they should be illegal in my opinion
they don't taste good
you're gonna instinctively bite down on
one
and the choking risk is like is through
the roof
extremely low tier candy
i wonder if covet is going to be like
the final uh nail in the coffin for
those 25 cent jelly bean dispensers you
see at the grocery store
when you check out i never
everybody's lamenting all restaurants
and
movie theaters and travel and cruises
and stuff like that
nobody cares about the vending machines
where you can put 25 cents in
and get six little candies and you don't
even know if it's candy when you eat it
because sometimes it turns out to be gum
and you're like wait a minute oh no this
is candy this is and then you get two
seconds later and you're like ah
actually it's gum
what or the the
the weird extremely hard fruit candies
you know what i'm talking about where
the banana's good but like the
the orange explodes into powder when you
bite it
some of those are are actually pretty
sweet
like um if you can get like a cool
bouncy ball out of those
like they're made of vibranium like
vibranium and flubber
mixed together you can smash a car
window with them i think
chicken and banana exactly exactly
yeah don't don't eat that though it's
hard to tell the difference between a
bouncy ball and a jawbreaker
but you'd rather eat the ball probably
bombs
it's called a gumball machine well if it
if it serves uh
gumballs yeah
one breaks a window the other breaks
your jaw
there's something there to overthrow the
earth
their jawbreaker jawbreaker and the
brain brain
you know what i'm talking about pinky in
the brain it's the perfect opportunity
for rat jam
uh brimstone bombs
delightful
what's this guy talking about he sounds
faded uh that's fair i'm i'm like
i'm slightly faded for sure like you
could fade me
because my optimism is at an all-time
low about finding a freaking key
i would just love to experience uh you
know
it's like ten thousand bombs and also
infinite bombs when all you need is a
key
like alanis morissette said
it's just getting ridiculous man it's
like rain
on your wedding day i mean i suppose
with with golden bombs we could just
keep
blowing and blowing them up and hoping
to get like a like a glitter bomb or
something but it's
you know it's not how i saw myself
spending my launch day
ruined my devil deal chance
f got a little ambitious there i suppose
i did uh i watched on ctv news there was
a
human interest story about a young lady
and this is how you know
youtube is in um is you know you
you can do whatever you want on youtube
you know there's an audience for it
was a a lady in canada who
her her whole vibe over kovid
was releasing covid themed alanis
morissette
parodies and i gotta tell you you might
think it's very minor
she filmed like
shot for shot remake of uh
of the ironic music video playing all
four parts
lip syncing the custom lyrics to her
song like she was all in
it's pretty pog yeah it gives you
something to do at least right
it's not so bad i mean it's not as good
as an item room in a shop in a bunch of
golden chests but
and in the original old english exactly
help yep that's fair i deserve that one
i'll be honest
yeah all i did was gain 15 pounds and
have a baby
i could have been making uh all sorts of
uh
like parodies of sloan songs or
something like that
she was under vast if that's a
word i know it's not cause i looked it
up
thank you thank you thank you for the
rant jams appreciate it
you know what did i think was gonna
happen
can we get another slint reference the
streamer
gave another slim reference he thought
long and hard
about the tracks from the five-track
album
he hadn't referenced before losing his
self-confidence
in the middle of making the bit
scream scream scream
scream something like that
i mean it's not it's not my favorite bit
but something along those lines
i i do enjoy i do enjoy the
noise it's true it's so melodious really
gets the people going
a key please weird bit do not get it
uh so put the baby metal on pause for a
little bit
i want to regale you with a story of a
little math rock band from texas called
slint their entire discography
is very easy to listen to it's like six
songs and then they broke up because
they were like 14 years old and went
their separate ways
it's called uh spiderland sweetheart and
you don't even need to listen to the
whole album until you get the vibe
you can just listen to track one and
also the final track it'll give you the
gist of it
okay now what happens if you mash two
books together
it's a super book
i don't know what's happening but i'm
kind of with it
did ryan listen to the new echo 2k
chip i i don't know what music you
listen to
but i have to in my head it's just the
katamari soundtrack over and over
or like um lovely planet or something
[Applause]
or like the go team do you like the go
team you feel like
to me the vibe i get from talking to you
is like you would be a go
team kind of individual
basically like any song that sounds like
it's from the sega dreamcast
yes sir
and now that item is useless
yep you're not wrong huh
yeah okay fair enough
[Laughter]
i guess we'll go back and get the boss
the wisps are a little different yeah
the wisps are doing some new stuff but
i i don't like that these guys are like
out here
like trying to take shots at me
i guess if we had a full charge it'd be
better but like i don't know
i'd rather just find an item that is
like i mean it's kind of a false dilemma
but i'd rather find an item that has
just like a one or two room charge to
begin with
they they used to be everywhere they
used to be everywhere in the game
you couldn't shake a stick without them
being like here's lemon mishap
thank you uh isaac's room uh black
market incoming confirmed black market
incoming
the trinket is useless yeah it's useless
right now
once we get a good item an item that
fits the bill
we're all going to be sorry i meant
we're all gonna be happy
i meant we're all gonna be happy not
sorry
no this is the this is the right game
plan
stop calling me a boomer man here's the
thing i actually think i've uh
well like we have a zoomer here like the
the king of the zoomers chibly is here
chibly tell the people that i'm not
that much of a boomer if anything
i'm probably i've got more of a zoomer
energy than most of the people in chat
the only difference is i'm not regularly
sad
and have it on display on main i keep
those feelings to myself
which is not very gen z but apart from
that
i think i got the vibe pretty much down
chibly could you weigh in please
yes sir
um okay just give it a sec no pressure
he said you're a very understanding
boomer i'm i am a self-aware boomer in
that sense
like sometimes chibly will make like a
joke
about stocks and then i'll just write
like 30 lines about like when
upcoming like earnings calls are
happening and he won't reply at all
i'm pretty sure that in his head he's
like he doesn't know that i was joking
and i'm like in my head i'm like i knew
he was joking
i just wanted to talk about stocks
nobody wants to talk about him with me
so when i get even the slightest
opportunity to
to discuss them i i go i get too
enthusiastic
you know i i definitely picked up on the
vibe that we're not on the same
wavelength in the conversation
and i said that's a sacrifice i'm
willing to make
okay somehow we're still alive
[Laughter]
i don't believe it
strong melee vibes milly means
millennial oh hell yeah dude
i'll take that
it's messed up dude millennials are like
we're turning 40.
i don't even know what what is the okay
so let me put this when i when i think
of like gen
x i always think of like uh
sarcasm and like complaining that
they're wedged between
two generations that get more attention
and like even though they grew up in the
era of like you know some of the
greatest music
they're like you know oh our life sucks
because
daria got cancelled or whatever like
they they go freaking crazy for uh buffy
the vampire slayer
like that that's the vibe i get from gen
x okay
zoomers it's like um
you as a zoomer and this is negative
it's gonna cause some drama in chat i
apologize
um zoomer is like you can't ever say
that you like anything
unless you have an encyclopedic
knowledge of like
absolutely everything tangentially
related to the thing that you just said
you liked and what they've ever done and
said in their entire life
like oh not nl saying he likes good eats
uh by alton brown without realizing that
alton brown
eight years ago gave an instagram live
where he
you know said that he something
something you know
and then
i don't know like the boomer jokes make
themselves but i don't
understand like what's the millennial
vibe you know
like i know as from being inside the
bubble
no you can't say depression gen z
already took that
fake authenticity outdated memes
harry potter okay harry potter that's
bang on i'll give you that one no doubt
yes sir
overeducated underemployed okay
definitely seems apt as well can't deny
that one
like literally i i think i only have
like five friends
and i know like 30 people with phds
the ratio is all fricked up there's no
doubt about that
i don't know the other millennial vibes
yet though like i don't know if
we've gotten there
i feel like millennials are like
food photographers
like let's see when i think of
millennials and i try to put myself
outside of the
generation they're like the generation
that gets a big old you know what for
taking photos of food
the zoomers still take photos of their
food i don't know
my parents they i don't think they've
ever taken a photo of food they didn't
make
zoomers consider it cringe you know what
i don't disagree with the zoomers
i i've been known to consort with some
food photographers
i you know it's not a big deal i i'd go
sure i'll wait to take a bite until you
take a photo
but uh i you know
got out of the habit of doing it myself
time to do some adulting i think we got
made fun of enough for that that it
stopped
now it's that i'll admit that's
embarrassing for sure
i don't know the other millennial
tendencies though
i don't know i guess i gotta like ask uh
i i gotta get a good picture of it
both generations love the joker that's
that's where we come together
i can't believe we didn't get hit there
i also can't believe we've been on this
run for two hours it's oh
20 minutes
i don't know is people in chatter saying
zoomer energy is calling everything
cringe
i don't know if that's true i feel like
most of the time i
i see someone calling
uh something cringe it's like someone my
age that cares too much about what
people think of them
but i might be wrong i don't know
i mean you know i'm just this is one
man's experience
it's also it's kind of hard to like draw
the line because if you were like what's
millennial energy
like 15 years ago when a lot of
millennials were still in like high
school
they'd be like listening to fallout boy
that's the number one thing
you know a lot of so the older zoomers
are like in their early 20s right but
you know some of zoomer culture is like
you know you're kind of like picking up
on observations of somebody that's still
a
child
you best believe it's on site wait in
the good way or in the bad way
wait neither way please
stop stop i was glancing
honestly dividing people by generation
is very stupid
you know what you're right that is a
great caricature of what a millennial
would say
a little bit of gen x energy in there as
well
100 confirmed not boomer or gen z
both generations convinced that they are
faultless
okay we're doing great stuff here
13.5 chance of a deal with the devil i'm
not gonna worry about that right now
we're just gonna kick some bombs in
there on occasion
we're gonna enjoy life
range up hold on wait hold on there's a
library back here
why didn't you tell me
nobody told me there was a freaking
library back there
you only have one key a library only
costs one
key
this isn't a train wreck but it it's
kind of like in the vicinity
i think we have one damage upgrade
no well i don't know the people said
synrobes got nerfed
we had stapler stapler's a damage
upgrade
pick up key what do you mean
okay hold on we gotta hydrate while we
think here
this is a painful room you start with
book of shadows
you begin with book of shadows
you turn it on you get bookworm now
we're talking
we leave with satanic bible
although because we can't get demon
hearts
actually we leave
with book of shadows
i'm stupid because book of shadows has a
smaller charge
what the heck just happened
[Laughter]
oh maybe that was the the satanic bible
wisp
oh dude we got a brimstone wisp that's
pretty cool
i don't know maybe we'll stick with it
do you think that brimstone wisp is from
satanic bible
that seems pretty good
no you already had it ah whatever
nevertheless
moving on
hp i'm more of a worcester man myself
but i can get you know the mark of me
not being proud of the dinner that i've
cooked
is when i serve it with hp sauce
like i i gotta be honest though i i for
hello fresh
i cooked uh some turkey meatloaf like
two nights ago
i didn't think it was very good well
before i tasted it before i tasted it i
didn't think it was very good
i put a bunch of hp sauce on it ate it
and i was like this is actually
delicious it didn't even need the sauce
i was i was embarrassed in my lack of
confidence i had a
a doubter energy
oh we've already found the second secret
room
i had a doubter energy on my own dinner
hp sauce i don't know it's like a tangy
um
pseudo barbecue sauce from the united
kingdom
jesse what are you talking about you
don't know hp sauce
it's pretty good i guess yeah i don't
know if it's the same as
brown sauce but it is uh
we broke the tinted rock over there but
it
is uh good
i support it it is brown sauce
yeah i would say it's not the same as
like a1 it's
they're they're in the same genre
without a doubt but
but they're they're cousins rather than
siblings
that's all right i'm i don't need that
item but wait
but wait it's got a small charge
yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know man
let's just give it a try
i don't even i don't know how any of
this works dude
i'm just i'm flying by the seat of my
pants
are you gonna give me some cool wisps
i mean i do i've got like a what the
heck
i don't know what happened wait maybe
hold on did they change the way
that uh this item works
like maybe it hurts you to use
no i just got hit all right fair enough
duly noted it did not create a lost
do it again i don't know what's
happening
it seems to be working though we got we
got some momentum here
yeah we need unicorn stump man
excuse me oh that was a random bomb
double decker crawl space still full of
pure garbage
frick
two floors of trash gaming will never
be the same sorry sorry the run's just
taking it out of me okay
just i just need some damage man
i'm losing my mind
i'm a man of contradictions right now
the only way i get damage is by having a
full charge but i
the only way i'd see what the new
character does is by using my charge
you know one of the biggest buffs in
this game is
uh mom's heart spawning the eyes like a
second after you walk into the room i've
taken contact
damage to them almost every time i'm
embarrassed
you swore a lot in the older isaac vids
it's true
i also used to poop my pants when i was
a little kid but you know what
times have changed we're living in the
21st century now
keeping it clean i thought we could
sneak through there come on man
you've unlocked whisper baby first
unlock
ladies and gentlemen we got him
don't swear
what do you think about the new stat bar
i think
that uh smaller hud is a great addition
no doubt i still need to
understand what the like the new rate of
fire is like but
like what makes a good like what's a
good stat what's a bad stand etc
etc but
no yeah like we know it's shot per
second but i don't know like what's a
good amount of shots per second like
obviously the higher the better but
i mean like sure shots per second is
like is nice but it's not as intuitive
as being like oh my fire rate is uh an
abstract
three
an off-course gentleman's handy even
okay you gotta go
doubters assemble doubters
should lose on this one uh like
you know it's a hard game and the dlc
has made it harder for sure
however this is certainly a winnable run
if we lose it i lay it at the altar of
my own feet
oh drake thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you thanks poppy
i was in mouth chat the other day and
someone said
mouth can you name a single drake song
and it got me thinking
i can but i think i can only name
two hotline bling
and uh god's plan
that's all i know
i don't i don't think i like i mean i
probably heard
i i know his voice i don't think i know
the other
the names of the other songs though
yeah is the six something like it's an
album views from the six
right that guy was chilling on top of
the freaking cn tower
must be nice
you're you know what you're right i do
know the one that goes i left
something a ride for something
put it all together that's the way
you're something something
that's a that's a pretty catchy one
that's all i know though man
were you a degrassi fan no i was like
the the new degrassi
was a little like
it started airing right at the tail end
of my
high school career i think and when
you're at the end of like
high school you're like i don't want to
watch a show about high school that's
for middle schoolers
i want to watch a show about college or
like a
doctor's or like what about a guy who
got like the entire layout of the prison
tattooed on his body
you know grown-up stuff
i still don't get prison break i gotta
ask malf about it sometimes
like didn't he break out of the prison
in season one or two
like what what did the show do after
that like i remember i used
in season one i would see clips and be
like yo
that looks cool i wonder if they're
gonna get out of the prison and then
they were like you know on season three
of prison break and they were just like
in the woods and i'm like
seems like you've kind of hit your
logical end point
okay we have unlocked another item
they went to a different prison really
okay we unlocked the book of virtues top
left item
f we got two luck there's a chance down
here
yeah they should have done it like
american horror story like a different
prison
every season
they break out a
they could break out a freaking gitmo
that could be the series finale
but don't worry he's he's in there by
accident like what he didn't do any bad
stuff
break out a github no that's impossible
they're owned by microsoft now
i don't know what that's supposed to
mean it is true though okay that's a
good item
yeah what if they were in a prison
that was too big to tattoo on their
whole body
that could that could have been the
gimmick of a season man
they they they ruined it this prison's
too big to tattoo on your back and your
front
okay don't kill me please i've come a
long way here
it's like you know when a show's got a
logical endpoint like that you gotta
respect it
like when dexter finished his lab they
were like okay it's not dexter's lab
anymore it's just called dexter
i respect that
that was a little spicy
you know you gotta you got to evolve
with the times
yo did you see that viral marshawn lynch
video that was going around yesterday
it's so good
i think i i don't know that much about
marshawn lynch but i feel like he might
be the coolest guy on the planet
when he's at the applebee's and he's
like i love the ambiance i love the
decor
i can't decide which one i love more the
ambiance of the decor
they let me pour my own drinks if you
feel so powerful
it's so good
he goes to dave and buster's and they're
like you know
marshawn says he loves dave and buster's
because it reminds him of his two
favorite people
buster douglas and dave concepcion
you're like what the heck are you this
guy he's playing the whole
he's putting the whole system on trial
when keeping it cool goes right this is
a heck of a room
is he pranking us you talking about
marshawn lynch are you talking about me
because i'm really
i'm doing my best
this is this is pretty tight here man
i'm really trying
i don't want to use my my spacebar item
because uh
yikes yikes uh
by not using it we have an all stats up
guess i'll die that like
that run was impossible
i don't know what you want from me on
that one i
i felt like we went almost the entire
run without getting like a
single stat increase is



all right let's do some challenges man
here we are it's been a good stream so
far
oh so what he's did this week oh yeah
easily
all these easy okay here we go we've got
pika run
scat man and bloody mary
he's poop let's see so we got nine volts
chocolate bar and
many uh poop bombs i see that we have
many poop bombs oh when we poop
we create a little dips okay so we need
to
dodge this is my take on the subject
we need to dodge great great start and
let our dips do the talking
the master of walking diagonally has
logged on
whatever it's worth it
i work at dave and busters and you're
100 correct it's just crazy man like
we gotta chat let's get together and
like open an arcade
because like i i gotta grade it you put
the money up for it i'll be the
ceo um cause like
when you run an arcade you buy the
arcade machine i don't know how much
could it like a daytona usa
cabinet cost like maybe like five or ten
grand
you charge you a dollar a play forever
people will play daytona usa until the
end of time
and i don't know much about electronics
but i'm pretty sure they never go bad so
how bad could the overhead be
i wouldn't even be a silent partner at
an arcade to be honest
yeah because you you can't be a silent
anything in an arcade have you ever been
in one
people baby
you can't hear yourself think it's crazy
in there which is why it's such a good
business
it overrides your judgment centers
and uh you guys come on here
come on you can't think and all of a
sudden you're paying five bucks to play
a game that you could buy on the console
for like
you know 75 cents
joker yeah surely these couldn't
be useless let's just take them all
mom's knife
mom's knife i'm dead i'm stupid okay
restart sorry i went
that was my old muscle memory for deals
with the devil where they never
dynamically changed their pricing
i would say get used to it because i'm
sure we're going to do that a lot over
the course of early repentance
especially
it's a shame that that mom's knife was
really gonna tie that run together
incredible play incredible play
oh that's right sorry gift these gifties
okay hold on
i'm not gonna skimp on the gifties i
just need to dodge for another 10
minutes while these enemies uh
you know very very slowly choose that
it's not worth it and just let me pass
you know what we can do stay safe and
then
drop one of these over here there you go
okay
it is what it is me you live by the
sword you die by the sword
hard to be a streamer that's like we've
given out like 20 gift subs today
it's crazy you also heal from poops
how about that like got the badge though
got the badge though
i will say i'm very impressed with the
difficulty of of
uh repentance nothing on this run has
has come easily that's for sure
well there goes that eternal heart
i do think you know i wouldn't want to
be part of an arcade i think
i do i just don't believe in the
business
now if there's if they're opening bullet
ball parlors
now we're talking
you can just walk into normal enemies
believers
you can just walk in but you heal from
poops
oh so you just oh
so you can't lose
you can just walk into them
you run into enemies take damage but
turn them into poops that heal you
air go you get back to full health
seems a little uh resinous to me
but what do i know
i'm bad at games everybody knew that
already though
poggy tears upgrade getting all the good
items when we can't even use them
hello josh josh you want to open like an
arcade together
think very carefully before you answer
this question
this will kill us right am i stupid
not stupid it would be funny but just
don't mess with it man
he said yes okay well see i just
like i said i don't believe in the
business model i'm out
confirmed bad idea
i can hear him in my head okay dude f
me i guess no no it's cool
gone but not forgotten
oh now we're talking f me i guess see
the decor the ambiance
i don't think i've ever been to an
applebee's i know they're like not all
that but i'd like to at least be able to
form my own opinion
rather than you know just relying on
knowing that they're not that good
i'll take you to one all right but i
like i want to do the ultimate trash
applebee's like i don't want
to be like you know i'll get the prime
rib dinner i want to get like the five
dollar unlimited appetizers or whatever
what did we go to in niagara falls that
was basically an applebee's
really that was a tony roma's i thought
tony roma's was a classy place
you might remember that it's tony roma's
by the way because i believe you asked
the waitress if tony was working today
to which she replied uh no and then i
believe a second later she said
i think he died
like a long time ago um
so this this run goes out to tony roma f
in chat for tony roma
gone but not forgotten
f f f f in chat you hate to see it
this is the roma it's called the tony
roma
it is the place where you go it's the
place
you go when you die
you know that one
i don't know now you've got in my head
you've got i don't even know what tony
roma looks like so in my head it's just
papa john
and he's doing forever
symbol over his chest i i i
hate my brain man i don't know if it's
ever gonna get back to normal
it's so i just uh it's just papa john in
my head
doing doing the yo bombay gesture
it's bad man it's bad stuff
but it it is kind of funny as well
you gotta admit there's some humor
anyway i know i wouldn't want to open an
arcade
here's a question for you chad if you
had if you had and
this not for not for pleasure just for
profit if you had
infinite money but you had to like
brewster's millions spend it on
opening a a kind of business what
business would you open
i still feel like america
has a lack of a national
insanely popular bubble tea chain
i should not just be walking into you
that's my bed i know there's some
and particularly in the big cities but i
still think there's space
for for a company to americanize bubble
tea
to the extent that it can survive in
like you know right next they could have
a location right next to the baseball
hall of fame
i believe in i believe in the business
you know bubble tea might be a fad but
it's not a fad here
it's been it's been popping for like a
decade
i don't know if it's getting more
popular but they're open in more places
so
either it's getting more popular or
they're like insanely bad
business i guess
and here's how i i respect it i don't
even like bubble tea really
like it's uh i
i i almost don't get it like it's sweet
so what you know
that don't impress me much
but even still i know what's good for me
so when i'm out on the walk with the
baby
you best believe there's about a 30
chance i'm coming home with a
winter melon tea with pearls
let's go
winter melon is street cred i do like
the winter melon has like a little
bitterness to it
if if i were to drink more bubble tea it
would be winter melon probably
or cookies and cream
uh i've never had boba is it good it's
good
for sure yeah i mean like it it tastes
good
it's sweet you know
it it it it's not it's not that
compelling to me but it it
the flavor is good like it appeals to
your your
you know lizard brain for sure
what would you call the the bubble tea
chain that's a great question
i'm a big believer in a name but i think
everybody that
we know is like they get the name
meta all wrong i don't think you need to
have a
pun i think you just need the name to be
snappy
like is there a famous chain restaurant
in america
that is wordplay i can't think of one
wendy's like when when these chicken
strips getting inside of my mouth
oh my order's up right now is that is
that the word play
chick-fil-a that's not word play in my
opinion that's like
i i don't even
under it it is what because
but it's not like they could have called
it chick
fillet it wouldn't have been word like
it's not it
there's no punch line they just spelled
the word wrong
you know what i mean
as like a joke unless did it start in
like philadelphia or something
or or the fillmore district in atlanta
like i don't get it
i don't get it okay hooters that's a
i'll allow that that's a real answer
but i my my point i suppose is merely
that they're few and far between
i think everyone always looks for a pun
you want to call a bubble tea place you
know something
that'll get the people going something
easy to remember
so i would call my bubble tea place
mcdonald's
but with an a in between the m and the c
yeah yeah that's the ticket
we just spelled the word wrong exactly
exactly man that's taken nah
only if they sue me
call it rye abs nobody wants to get
bubble
tea at a place called rehabs
unfortunately i think we're gonna have
to put some extra sauce on it
i don't know though i think a bubble tea
place is like you know
i think it's a lock man sure some of
them go out of business but just like be
built different
you know
how hard could it be forehead
or like a korean barbecue restaurant
because you don't even have to pay any
chefs
the dummies will cook the food
themselves and then they'll they'll tip
you on top of that
what a country
genius so this is
just like is is basically unlosable huh
that's the that's the thing on this
challenge
you lost it well yeah but i'm as
mentioned i'm built different but this
time in like a bad way
come on man you know hey i don't got all
day here
we could lose we could go to the
self-sacrifice room
we also do have no bombs there's some
truth to that
we might end up just dodging a lot i did
this whole challenge without knowing
that i could touch enemies
that's so good
[Laughter]
but you know you get bragging rights
i mean i wouldn't have known if it
weren't for chad honestly i would have
been out here just spinning my wheels
being like you know it's impossible who
made this
we should save this we could get a deal
why not
but now we don't even need a deal
hold on i'm losing my mind
we could get any item that's exactly
what we wanted anarchist cookbook who's
out of bombs now buddy
who's out of bombs now not me
couldn't be me
look at that greatest item in the game
he's done it kidney stone
confirmed confirmed kidney stone
we can shoot a single tier
[Laughter]
yo it's a progressive rate of fire
it gives you a huge rate of fire and
then takes it down now
i think that's pretty cool
that's pretty cool man that's pretty
sick
josh you're gonna play any repentance i
gotta tell you
i don't know if it's up your alley it's
it's not a real time strategy game from
the mid-2000s
i doubt it nerds are saying it's really
hard apollo did alt-f for the game
which is you know it just makes me that
much stronger
when he tweeted that it was super hard i
was like good
yeah yeah let the let the hate flow
through you
i'm not in the hard games bro that's
crazy because like real time strategy
games are the hardest games ever made to
even be bad at
like i can't even
whenever i play those i i can't even
like get my
economy stable much less like then i get
invaded by a bunch of
like you know weird aliens and i'm just
like whatever
just go ahead and take it it's trash
anyway
i should stop using the bombs the bombs
are quite
useful quite helpful i just need an
orbital man we get an orbital can of
corn and i'll be all right
well challenge uh invalidated
you have defeated an enemy using a tier
go back to step one do not pass go
how dare you
sure why not let's let's get it all out
of the way
you got you got any items for me that
don't do anything i'm happy to have them
so i think i know what that i had this
candle earlier today
i think i know what it does um
it uh if you keep the candle alive
it gives you a progressive tear bonus
every room i think like it tears up
every room
to the best of my knowledge something
like that
i've been playing a bit of yakuza kiwami
i'm sure chad will be happy to hear that
our guy slash our guy
don't you think they're kind of milking
those yakuza games a little much though
like they were only
i remember i was at tokyo game show a
few years ago there were like
six of them right five of them maybe at
the time
now like a new one comes out on steam
like every half hour i don't understand
how they're able to do that
like how in the last year there's been
like
like six came out and then like a dragon
and kiwami and like
wasn't there a new one that just came
out like like yesterday or something
like how are they making so many man
like did they hire the guy who made five
nights at freddy's
their output is like out of control i'm
jealous is really what it's all about
that's what i'm trying to say
it's not a bit it's not the beats
put that cookie down ah put that karaoke
down
sorry it's a little-known actor by the
name of
arnold s
josh you'll give it to me straight how
how much time is it gonna take you to
beat the new yakuza game
because like i'm at the point in my life
where like
oh it's gonna take forever okay say no
more all right
okay everybody sorry you heard it i was
about to play it and then josh said it
would take too long so
looks like i'm taking it off the the
twitch schedule
well you know the old people's champion
how the mighty have fallen
thanks a lot josh i think it's just too
long
for for my current streaming mindset
it's too long for me
it's too big for you
is this the this is the final floor
right we're almost free
oh f you're gonna make me not play yeah
cause uh
wait a minute hold on it's scary in here
we're gonna be here for a hundred years
no that's not true i have bombs use them
just a long game man like why play an
80 hour long game when instead you could
use that time to do 400 different
quizzes on sporkle.com
what if i could get her to stomp on
samson's chain
and then free me and then i could pick
up samson's
chain and use it
as a a cannonball
to destroy her or
there you go one one shot at a time by a
kidney stone baby
one shot at a time just waiting for
kidneys oh i think we got it
no it just it just came off uh the bonus
let's go run into the little enemies of
course you fool you fool
okay kidney stone the kill shot with
kidney stone would be a dream
my god the man is a genius boss rush
yeah sure why not
just kidding all right
uh easy challenge
dirty mind has been unlocked next
challenge



easily beat uh whatever the first
challenge was
scat man now we're on bloody mary i
believe you also play as bethany again
good luck in the next challenge uh oh
i'm a little scared i'm a little scared
i remember this item i don't remember
what it does
the the sword but i remember the item
i'm not ignoring josh
i i saw what he said he said the side
missions are your jam
i believe it but they're like you know
they're so long man
also if the side missions were my jam
like
why would um why wouldn't they make the
whole game out of them
the same way they make the whole plane
out of the uh the
black box
what's the deal with side missions
i mean i'll give you the same deal that
we did with with death stranding
all play longer games but you have to
watch the whole damn thing
okay like if you watch like one episode
and then turn it
tune in here or there
it's gonna be a deal breaker you gotta
you gotta be there for every second
and tell like minimum 100 of your
friends
and then maybe i'll give it a one hour
tryout
i'm also always i'm a little wary and
this is not an anti
yakuza thing at all i'm a little wary of
those games that like
everybody wants you to play that they've
already played
because i'm like i i feel like i'm like
the band at a at a concert and they're
like playing my favorite song
i always see in chat people are like and
i was gonna love the
the bike mission has he done the bike
mission yet
has he done the bike mission oh my god
he's gonna load guys
did i miss the bike mission then when
the bike mission shows up
unless it's like you know the greatest
thing i've ever seen in my life i'm like
wasn't all that you just kind of rode a
cool looking bike man
i don't know though corey do you have a
your your
you lived in japan oh my god
did you like yakuza have you played it
it seems like it'll be your cup of tea
red hearts means you get more
uh hp hey tomorrow
but this rock is pretty sick too
it's fun but i didn't like it for stream
uh oh
oh no i'm just now realizing
doesn't this item take you down to half
a heart at the start of every floor
oh but you gulp your stats okay
that's mighty interesting
i don't have any wisps
oh gifties give these
no please
i forgot
let's go saved god gamer
okay so then you know every challenge
you can kind of distill
down to like what how do i break it
right how do you break this one it's
pretty simple
be so good that you never get hit or
alternatively get like a book of uh
revelations or something oh and there's
no item rooms right
yeah now i'm i'm piecing it together and
you can never get
uh spirit hearts because you're bethany
and you can't
uh
you have to go all the way to mega satan
oh my god
we could change character that's a good
point if we get like dark judas or
something
too bad i just squandered the deal with
the devil like a fool
i mean restock and then like infinite
money could do something for us
ah just normal satan okay
i mean if we could do this on the first
try that's that's a powerful motivator
when another isaac uh content creator
one of the top
60 daily players of all time flak blag
tells you that tells you good luck
if that doesn't light a fire under you
you're living in the north pole
i will take every pill
did he do the bike mission jesse what
the hell are you talking about
shot speed up
it's very aggressive um
i will head in here and then
get nothing but that's fine because we
couldn't have used it anyway tears down
bombs are key
yeah i got nothing else to say anyway if
we're gonna play yakuza it's not gonna
be for a long time
we're gonna have to win a single run of
this first which might uh take 30 hours
i'm not sure
should be a little uh variety tomorrow
though like uh
dan and i i think we're still going
ahead with the with hand and brain which
i'm excited for
you know we're not gonna just know life
isaac for forever
excuse me by the way i saw somebody say
uh
no band stream sag some of you were not
here for
the um marriage or mortgage conversation
ended shows
sad couldn't be me couldn't be me
it is not pronounced sad gu it's sag
and it's honestly sad good that you try
to bait me like that
disrespectful okay i did see someone in
chat
say that it's only a 30
chance for small rock to work now
which is very unfortunate
[Laughter]
this is no longer an item i think i want
to hang my hat on
okay i mean you got to use it
new shot speed just dropped
nl's credit card been real quiet since
this challenge started
he lived
oh uh almost died a bone heart
that might protect us from one hit
hate this just don't drop a troll bomb
like that's all i ask
actually a single bone heart if we don't
lose it
should be like a permanent
protection until we lose it i should say
as long as we can fill it up at some
point on every floor oh but that's gonna
that's gonna mean not getting hit for
like a long time
yeah that's tough i don't even know if
we ever got close to full on the last
floor
oh well you know what you do hold on
we're getting a little bit more
complicated but in a good way
um we
simply have to make it so that on a deal
with the devil we give up
all of our hp except for one heart
container and the bone heart
and then it's so much easier to fill and
we have a lot of protection and
presumably
presumably some good items
from the deals with the devil as well
how about that
how's that for some gaming
ah whatever
no spawns you know what
it's a little tough
now i'm like who did they have play test
this game because there's only like
eight people on the planet capable of
of hanging in here right now and i'm not
even sure that i'm one of them
don't shoot a green ball at me don't
shoot
red hearts let me guess red hearts no
okay never mind that would be too easy
you gotta stack those flames up yo but
none of my
bookable aisle plays have actually
created flames for me because we
i don't think we have book of wisps or
whatever book of virtues i think we just
have book of belial
how the heck are you supposed to do this
man
you already did it once oh well in that
case
okay
we need hp more than anything else i'm
like
sharp key doesn't do enough for us
because we don't get any freaking wisps
when we use it if we got wisps that
would be nice but we don't you know i
think we got it yeah i was hoping to get
like a single half red heart or
something but no such luck
red heart there's a chance
so you're saying there's a chance
i'm gonna take the card i agree i you
know what and that justice card we gotta
play this like a lost run right now
paint me like one of your lost runs by
the way i i saw your compliment josh
thank you i i
you know i'm i'm worse than i should be
at this game considering how much i
played it but i
i'll take the compliment as it stands
for luck now we're talking
and there's no item rooms anyway so uh
we don't have to backtrack because
there's no point
look at that okay now
we're just praying for easy boss bombino
as i saw dan fight this guy he's a melee
driven boss
yo 30 chance to pick up some money
that was not great goodbye deal with the
devil
i'm gonna die but i'm gonna live
until i die
it's not possible
thanks for the money dummy uh what if
you punch this bomb
yeah yeah right there idiot oh no
okay giving out some gifted subs cool
no big deal it's just the challenges is
like impossible
just click complete purchase click the
button complete purchase sad guy
a little sad guy there
like look you're oh you're gonna make me
cyber bully okay
the thing is like i get it it's supposed
to be a challenge they're not called
like runs that are easy to inflate your
self-esteem for no reason but at the
same time like
why no item rooms you know
it's already hard because you go down to
like zero hp at the start of every floor
that's that's
that's a tough challenge
and then on top of that it's it's also
got the
oh by the way screw you
so it's a little much but then that's
always how i feel about the challenges
and then when i beat them i go no never
nerf them
because then that wouldn't be fair to
the people who suffered earlier
was thinking hold on what if
it's a bit it's a bit ballsy
what if you got
a lot of stuff out of this
self-sacrifice room
this is boomer logic yeah it's the joke
the joke is that it has parallels to the
student loan forgiveness
debate i put it all in the required
reading
before the stream did you not get the
memo the sub only memo
i mean we released it on the patreon so
i i mean i feel like you would get it
unless you're not a tier three patron
you lost the syllabus i missed the part
where that's my problem
peter parker spiderman one words to live
by
we can't even get spirit hearts so what
do you do you could smelt a single
trinket for 15 cents
that's low value you could buy a card
and pray
that's my kind of strategy
get the hot pot it's not bad josh but
it's
it's not all that in the bag of potato
chips
good name by the way it does look like a
hot pot
and in many ways a smelter
you know it's kind of a
there's a pot that's hot
meet the pot that can't get hot super
cup
uh you can walk diagonally through these
i have found my ticket to narnia
you cannot destroy me i have the
ultimate dodging location
you can't hit me
that's pretty sick does this guy play
among us
um i have played among us i'm insanely
bad at it
i i'm like genuinely one of the worst
among us players you've ever seen
i'm good or let me rephrase i'm bad at
the tasks
i pay no attention whatsoever to what
anybody does and as a result i have no
way to accuse anybody of doing anything
i'm just living in my own head the whole
time
well it's something it's certainly
something
you feel blessed so now we got angel
room chances
dude that error room would have been
sick
an attempt was made
is there a red heart in the shop maybe
no i'm pretty i'm pretty terrible at
among us like
you know what could be worse
you got to take these chances i think
here
now trivia yeah now we're talking does
this guy play any trivia
so we got a very minor stat upgrade um
which is the only downside to having
spent
all of our uh our hp on the last floor
because we do lose it all when we come
down to this floor but man like this is
this is tough
holy mantle could
could really make my day
[Laughter]
like holy mantle sac dagger now we're
talking
yeah the stream we only got about 20
minutes left in the stream i appreciate
all the support today we'll be back
tomorrow to play
uh a bunch of repentance and also some
other stuff but
if you like what you see especially like
here's my cell okay
if you're a youtube viewer you're used
to you know maybe like five years ago
when
a new isaac expansion would come out i'd
release like four videos a day
the time to do that does not exist
anymore
is is gone and you know it might not
come back for like
i don't know until isaac 2 comes out
right we're streaming a lot on twitch
we're going to be playing a ton you
should follow on twitch and you get
unfiltered access to live isaac
including the runs that are so bad they
won't make it to youtube
isn't that a nice selling point you
could get a lower average quality of
content
but the trade-off is if you make a funny
joke in
chat i might steal it and pretend it's
mine so
you know you take the good with the bad
so i i would appreciate uh
clicking that follow button if you think
you'd like to see the content in the
future
you could be here for the the live pot
play
a live rendition of the pot plate
live from the hollywood bowl i don't
even know what the pod play is
all i know is i'm sick of hearing about
it shouldn't even brought up someone
will be like oh i got the
an oral history of the pod play
man you know would be sick any
consumables or any items
sorry did i say that out loud that was
meant for the private discord
for tier three subs only
okay i mean they call it a challenge for
a reason
i suppose
nice little jingle gotta try them
range up tears down that's pretty
terrible telepills is okay
paralysis is bad but at least it doesn't
impact us permanently
i just want to go into the shop man i
just want to go into the shop
how come you don't shop me man
okay great shooting you seeing this
accuracy like you know we're screwed up
when
like my accuracy is higher in isaac than
it is in pub g
bomb for a bomb the bang the bang second
secret room and up jump the boogie
yo saved okay
now this would be a wonderful time to
get a deal with the devil
it's it's merely larry jr
and a quick little tinted rock
with the red heart in it the spirit art
is irrelevant can you
you can stack book of belial huh well
like there's never been a better time
because we need a deal with the devil to
transform our lives
that's a damage upgrade which is very
nice
you might as well it's a great item it's
not something that's really gonna
you know win the challenge for us but
it's a nice item no doubt about that
and we still don't have a key and we're
not gonna get one but there's no reason
not to go to the curse room because
we're losing the hp to begin with
and then we'll tell the pills and see
what happens man it's it's got a better
chance than
than our previous run at least
donkey donkey donkey donkey that donkey
donkey donkey pitch perfect pitch
perfect rendition
well it at least it took me closer all
right now let's start it all over again
excuse me uh my flies please oh they
closed the door on me
i should have gone up fast oh
no no small room
every time i see a room i recognize it's
like
it's a dream come true when i see a room
i don't uh
recognize i get very very anxious
saved still no keys
what does the item do it takes all of
your red hearts except for half of one
every single floor and it gives you a
proportionate increase in
tears and damage based on how many red
hearts it took
i'm happy to stay here as long as
they'll have me quite frankly
so because of the fact that you know
bethany as a character
can't get spirit hearts essentially
you're always
gonna start every new floor one hit away
from death which is
is anxiety inducing without a doubt
is exactly what i was hoping for and now
i have no problem coming in here
it's a boss i've seen before my god
now what are you rooting for it's little
victories
all up and down that's how you get to
the the win here
you get a deal with the devil with your
36.9
chance repeating of course and then it
has a dream item in it
nice little damage upgrade no it can't
be taken
i know what you're gonna say i already
know what you're gonna say you take
you just diagonally walk take death's
touch and then go to victory
you don't take it you you're gonna want
to have
in my opinion at least you're gonna want
to have the empty heart containers to
fill up
i think it's the right way to play plus
like death's touch
controversial opinion maybe not that
good of an item
overrated insubordinate and shirlish
it's good but i don't think it's that
good
where's the keys uh johnny depp from uh
pirates of the caribbean
where's the keys gone they don't exist
two full floors no keys two floors
two uh full floors no keys how about
that
maybe there's some keys in here have you
taken my keys
no all right down to the next floor then
it's all right i didn't want to go to
the shop anyway six panties pog
the average penny enjoyer versus the
average
uh key worshiper
yoho song in pirates 3 rolls hard prove
me wrong
spelled r-o-n-g um
i've i've only seen the first pirates
film
i uh i bet it goes hard
wouldn't surprise me i mean you know
there's a reason people like them right
and it wasn't because johnny depp was
playing chris angel
he finally got a key pog now we just
need to live
just survive to the to the shop i still
don't even really know
on the shop what would i be looking for
i think consumables are kind of higher
value
because they allow us to i mean like a a
card that could be a joker or
you know i don't even like even a
lover's card or a justice card that we
could save until we got close to death
i'm starting to see like the light at
the end of the tunnel here
but it's still a long way to go yo the
sacrifice
thank you thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
appreciate it
safety blanket would be pretty good
happy repentance day oh thank and happy
repentance
and a happy repentance day to you as
well
what's happening oh the flies are doing
my dirty work for me like steely dan
i'm so stupid i was glancing
[Laughter]
don't let it demoralize you stay in
there
i was thinking about steely dan
i thought i was so safe let's go okay
saved saved
super saved now i can glance all i want
they'll make the whole universe my slave
play canasta with your grandma
then push her down the stairs just
thinking just thinking mor
more keys is is a positive there's no
doubt about that
could always play the blood bank with
remaining hp
restock i think is we gotta consider
restock
it gives us consumable swim
it used to give us consumables when you
bought it
which was fun
oh my god this shot speed
and we are getting a decent amount of
money can't deny that
i do want to go to the curse room but we
can't go to the curse room
until after we fight the boss because
this boss could
easily put me in the ground
what the heck yo the reflective tears
are like the
not tears but the reflective floor looks
so nice
second bomb
restock iv bag i don't know what that
means
we there is a blood bag for sure
i think we got to play this judgment
dude
cost us almost all of our bombs we're
using
probably more money than we should but
we kind of need the uh we need the high
value payouts here i don't know bumbo
bumbo is not it's not that bad it's not
that good but it's not that bad either
it's something at least i kind of want
the money for now
uh because we got restock but how was
restock nerfed by the way
was it just nerfed by like there's no
consumables anymore or did they do
something
um more insidious
price of items goes up okay
not not a concern that's germaine to
this run
now that is good luck okay so we'll take
it
we'll take it
these i want a little slice of all of
them
i'm gonna be honest i want a little
slice of all these we can't take them
both
so here's the thing okay sack dagger
best item um out of the three
but we can't afford to get that close to
enemies but it does have defense
associated with it
money equals power modest damage
increase
when we don't really need it
it's tough man hey troy thanks for the
gift of subs
thank you much appreciated
back at it again ba at it again with the
repentance
i agree with with the chat discourse i
think you take sack dagger
which apparently it looks smaller to me
but that's okay
it spins faster maybe i know we've got
the uh
eternal hard but we're
i mean i don't i just don't feel
confident in that
i'm mostly just happy to be alive
i am definitely at the point where like
a single
lovers card would would really hit the
spot
i'm concerned
because if i take it
i don't know let's take it it'll be
funny
oh it only gives us one heart okay i i
thought it was the item that gives us
uh it replaces all of our uh
all of our heart containers with with
empty bone hearts but
clearly that's not the case clearly
that's not the case
no he's so stupid he just gave away an
hp
upgrade for what killing me won't bring
back your gosh darn honey
compound fracture
look i get it corey you know the names
of the items okay congrats
good good for you okay everybody
everybody corey knows the names of
all the items corey oh mr big man daily
challenge champion
uh second place all time next to pells
he knows the names of all the items wow
wow
everybody just bow down you can tell the
difference between brittle bones and
compound fracture
geez louise yeah easy clap easy clap for
corey please
just because some of us can't tell the
difference between the 19 different
kinds of attack flies in the game i
guess you gotta you feel the need to
flex on me or something
isn't it enough for you coming second
place on the
leaderboards every day to pels
really makes you think man really makes
you think okay i don't even know
so here's like we're okay i got a plan i
got a plan
sorry corey sorry um we're gonna play
the blood bank
you're gonna be like of course because
you need the blood bag no i don't have
the the hp container would be nice but
we don't really care too much
um and the speed is irrelevant but for
bumbo to get like a little bit of money
would be pretty sick if i could even get
him like one level up
i would i would treat that as a the
small blessing that it is
um
and i'll tell you i mean maybe i'll buy
the pill
and then try to take it on the next
floor i think that's
i think that's my game plan right now
but hold on we're not done yet we're not
done yet
six cent item whoa
no i'm not worried about mom's key she's
she's got my number
on an average run shirt like we would
buy it no question on this run i don't
know i don't see the
the the use case
come on bumbo one one extra level up
please
one extra level up just one more
let's go
okay now we're free
we got it we got a level three bumbo not
quite max level but we're
trying to get every single advantage
conceivable this will be our last run
without a doubt though
okay debs one he's a genius
he's actually the smartest gamer
if we had mom's key we would be deceased
right now
and nobody would realize that it was
their fault
really makes you think man
you got 4 000 hours in this game who
who would you rather trust somebody with
4 000 hours or 4 000 people with one
hour
it's called the ship of theseus look it
up sometime it's on disney plus
if you it reminds me of a very famous
quote
if you want something done badly give it
to a group of people
if you want something done right give it
to a streamer
fool me once shame on you
fool me twice
we won't get fooled again
he's doing it man okay we gotta figure
out what we're gonna do on the next
floor though hold on hold on
okay whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i might
freaking deal with the devil no it's
still up there because we didn't lose
the bone heart yet okay great news
tinted rock no bad news okay don't
resort to using your sac dagger
you don't need to do it you don't need
to perform surgery
beautiful okay a second orbital incoming
yo this guy looks like nick bruiser from
punch out now they really did a good job
with the veins on his forehead
do it coward no you do it coward
okay we take and i'm just gonna very
quickly send a message to my wife on
discord i'm gonna say
hello i'm just finishing
this run shouldn't be more than
15 mins maximum well
i am putting a rush
on it there we go there we go
greetings good day to your partner i'm
greetings
you can already tell i'll be your only
friend in this
god forsaken camp
hold on i've received the reply okay
sounds good
poggy let's go
can you give your best punch out
announcer message
or impression nick
brozer
yeah it's a great game super punch-out
it's a great game man
gabby j yay
great game is nl on crack today
that'd be a pretty messed up character
uh turn right like if i just
turn to like hard street drugs
well it's legal now right
oh no you're i was thinking of uh grass
i had them confused because they're both
on the same level of danger
what do we got i don't know what i'm
talking about man okay the card is an is
a must buy
items my friendship with items now dead
friendship with items dead now
consumables are my best friend sorry
bumbo i should have let you have that
man i apologize that's on me
that's still somewhat useful
that actually is probably better um we
can use that to
have a better chance to get a red heart
for sure
it's okay frowny face oh no bumbo come
on
average consumable enjoyer
don't you have friends who enjoy grass
i wouldn't say i have friends who enjoy
it i would say
i have friends who the grass
enjoys them because it swallowed their
spirit and soul and
all their ambition and motivation and
hygiene habits and stuff but
you know would do does the friend enjoy
it i don't know
not as much as the grass enjoys the
beautiful spirit that it is enraptured
you know what i mean
hate the sin love the sinner
what are you talking about jesse
let's give it a try
for legal purposes this is a bit
dude imagine if that's what the law was
actually like like if you said
you could say whatever you want as long
as you add i'm joking to the end
that'd be something
oh i got so scared man
get out of jail free card
yes your honor i i dropped a sarcasm tag
at the end of my threat
real talk if i pick this up
will i be able to use get out of jail
free to leave this room
no all right see you later loser
you're a loser nobody likes you your
item sucks
help me
all right well like it's impossible man
it's an impossible game
it's impossible challenge



it can be done
the comedic timing all pills are good
now
confirmed confirmed
he do be spinning
i've i'm i'm and we've been doing this a
lot i'm making like a new
sweeping rule okay
like one rule that i had is if i get mad
at chad for more than two minutes
consecutively
and i show it um because i'm just
constantly a little upset sure you know
why not it's meme city let's do it
um
this should be fun did they remove
knockback on soy milk by the way
because if so that's sick that's a it's
an amazing item now
oh let's go i did see dan talking about
it and then like
i was like he was so positive about soy
milk i was like it must
either be changed or this guy has no
idea what he's talking about i suppose
both could be true
but anyway um i so the the rule of not
getting mad at chad has worked very well
the vibes have been way better
occasionally someone comes in and tries
to start an argument and you just either
like ignore them or
time them out and it's pretty sick uh
it's been much better
my new rule that i'm gonna start to
practice a little bit
is uh never answer
whether or not you're gonna play a game
unless the answer to the question is yes
because about nine this is really nice
about ninety percent of the time
that someone asks are you going to play
x game the answer is no
uh and if i say that it's taken
not just by the original person but by
everybody in chat
as like an opportunity and an invitation
to argue about like why actually you
should play it
or to make a joke that's like ohs but
you'll play this game
20 billion times but you won't play
this game one time a little hypocritical
much
right so i think that i i'm i'm slowly
teasing a part in diagnosing the vibe
destroyers and and that's a big one that
i
play my own role in for sure
i see people in chat with no irony that
are like if you don't answer the
question
you're gonna get the question more often
that's true
but if i answer the question i'm also
gonna continue to get the question
[Laughter]
just due to the nature of the of the
twitch ecosystem
people were like oh sorry i know i typed
it 1500 times in chat even though you
answered it you answered it before i got
here so
yo brandon all right sorry not brandon
not brandon thanks for the
the gifted subscriptions thank you
i'm watching this run then i'm going to
bed so you better make it a good one
you picked a good game because
repentance like the average run
went from like probably 30 minutes and
after birth plus to like 70 minutes in
in repentance so so prepare yourself
because you you might be up for a while
that could be a good thing though like i
don't know it depends if you got
something to do in the morning
yeah unless i die on floor two that's
fair that's a fair question
honestly i i got a new i got a new think
i got a new thing going on here
what if we don't go to the alt path on
floor one and then we go to the alt path
on floor two instead uh what the heck is
oh it's a dice room
how about that
which i think might guarantee with that
we get the
we get the mirror or maybe it gives us a
50 chance to get the mirror i don't know
changing chat meta too much i miss
armchair psychology
that's all right just wait till the next
time we play warzone like honestly the
number one
chat moderation tool in my toolbox is
activity
if you can have a lot of chat activity
people breaking the rules aren't as
annoying you know how it sounds
but you know
if if something gets swept away really
quickly then it's not that big of a deal
so if you wanna
if you wanna have uh that's such a good
item by the way
i'm gonna take it man i know it's a
little weird but
if you if you want to get some armchair
psychology in i know you're being
sarcastic but if you want to get some
armchair psychology in
you should uh you should just wait till
like maybe wars on monday
then you'll have an opportunity
it's all about the ratio yes sir
can't forget the ratio
it's worth the look at least
why not take guppy's tail i'm not a
believer in in guppy's tale
uh statically and i'm not that confident
in my ability to have the hp base to
take
uh all the deals with the devil that
show up so i've been a little bit
coy with the guppy plays lately i also
apparently guppy is uh
it only has a 50 or a 30 chance to spawn
flies on tears now like per shot
still really good don't get me wrong but
50 yeah so it's you know
it's relatively weaker than it was
recently but still
good okay
you know i'll probably take it when we
go back to the deal with the devil now
[Laughter]
guppy's tail in the paper clip though
you're gonna you're gonna make me tap
the sign
the sign is you know we may have
philosophical disagreements but
you know very minor backseating for the
guy who has 4 000 hours in the game
is underappreciated not not as
appreciated as you might think it is
you know we're both coming at this from
a learned perspective i'm sure
i'm sure you've you've probably got a
thousand hours
and that's cute i'm happy for you
we're gonna live yeah easily
best person whose name is also food
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
i don't mike trout kevin bacon
meatloaf iced tea
what about flava flav john hamm
dude that's a tough one i'll give you
the easy answer not
meatloaf steven fry that's a good one
that's funny eminem
i was walking uh the baby yesterday
come on man come on and uh
there there were two people like just
hanging out
uh listening to eminem
like super loudly on their phone
and like ramping the lyrics at each
other
and you're gonna laugh is is like such a
canadian part of the bit
um but like it was it was very funny to
begin with to look at
and then secondarily when the song
finished
uh the lady went [__] rights bud
and i was like
oh there's a tinted rock up there it i
was like it's the first time i've ever
heard somebody say that
in public unironically like i thought
that was a thing you only said
like when you're making fun of canadians
but no they're
i guess it's there for a reason
explosion immunity don't mind if i do
they would i can't deny they were having
a good time 4.5
volt beat the juice out of them no idea
what it means but
yo tell me you're canadian without
telling me you're canadian
we hear that all the time up north
that's crazy i mean i i did not grow up
uh
up north but i would have assumed that i
would have heard it in
my kind of like uh you know pseudo
hillbilly uh village where i grew up but
i think it's also a relatively recent uh
like within the past 15 years or so
it's had a resurgence let's say
the first time i ever heard it was in
fubar which is like
that's a while when i was a kid they
didn't
say it as much at least
yeah soy milk actually seems pretty
great now max
fire rate no knockback like i
i don't know what the downside is
4.5 seems like bad synergy for soy milk
though
i'm going to be honest i don't even know
what 4.5 volt does yet i'm assuming that
like
i have no idea you get a charge when you
hit enemies with some
extent oh it's slowly charges the active
yeah oh it gives you partial charges on
the batteries yo they turn the int into
a float dude
what's up with that
okay i gotta think about this this is
downpour two of course
as usual we can't see the uh
the map at all hello little ghost so we
have to
just figure out
where the the mirror and the fire are
it's hacker talk turn the int into a
float
hold on i'm almost in i just have to
cast the password to an int and then
type in 32.max value to institute a
buffer overflow
i'm in i'm going to steal all their nba
top shots
i'm gonna check this i'm not afraid
it's a unix system i know this
have you seen that clip of stanley
kubrick talking about um
unix
it's like he's being filmed on like a
camera
which i know is like oh of course what
else would he be filmed on a freaking
potato but like it's noteworthy because
it's in the 70s and it's like a handheld
camera or something like that so
you don't have to spin it up like you're
starting a lawnmower or something like
that
and then i think he reads like some
advertising copy he's like
it's a super powerful new operating
system it's called unix
it's a weird video man nl and comment
bagel are the only streamers i know who
aren't seething over repentance
[Laughter]
that's that's funny i know people are
like you know
it's it's hard like it's it's definitely
hard
i'm not oh what what i would say
is like i uh
i reserve judgment to some extent
because i all i'm i'm like at least
cognizant of the bias
that if you ever nerf anything like 90
of people who are used to it are gonna
hate it
if you buff something people are like
way less critical if you nerf something
they go
freaking off they're like i how dare you
hate fun
so i'm just you know i'm just chilling i
recognize you know like your first
impression
it takes a little longer to form what
you really think about it
i'm uh the game was very easy
before the runs where it was hard
in my opinion oftentimes they were hard
for the wrong reason
in this i feel like the runs that i lose
some of them admittedly
i have been like i had no chance
whatsoever
but a lot of them have just been like
man that boss was like
that was a tough boss what are you gonna
do
and again i i stand by what i said a
little earlier as well which is like
a lot of my losses also just come from
gamer inertia where i'm like i refuse to
do
this super easy way right at the start
even like i'm like i'm never gonna play
normal mode are you crazy and then when
i die i'm like it's too hard
like speaking of a perfect example right
here
what are you supposed to do man i got
soy milk there's nothing you can do
let's go oh i'm the loss though that
doesn't help me
now i'll tell you this would have been a
fantastic room to save uh
uh to save necronomicon for we could use
a damage upgrade let's
let's be realistic yo what if we
perthrowed that man
oh now we're talking
we got enough bombs we should be able to
bomb our way through the boss quite
easily
i don't think people are let me play
this i think people are are positive
about repentance um
especially new items i do think the
difficulty let me put it this way i
wouldn't be surprised if it gets tuned
down a little bit in the future
but i also think that streamers are like
you know when they're used to winning
anything that makes the run more
difficult is gonna
it's gonna be walked into the spikes huh
it's gonna encounter a little layer of
um
the barrier to entry for liking it is
gonna be higher because
you know there's almost like some ego
and some expectation on the line i guess
is what i'm trying to say
it's not to say that there's uh let's go
that's not to say there's not an
argument that maybe like there's things
to be changed
like definitely i do wonder to some
extent like hey you know i played three
thousand hours of this and
you know so viktor's played 3 000 hours
of this and if we're both struggling to
win runs where we have like the
you know two or three
previously game-winning items like maybe
there's a case to be made that it's a
little difficult for the person that
only has like 500 hours or something but
for now i think the difficulty is is
good and also like very
refreshing i would say can you get it i
don't know if you can get a deal with
the devil in the mirror realm so just
work with me on this one
or a new player well yeah but i'm for if
you're a new player like i don't know
like where were you like seven years ago
when the game came out
like i would rather they tailor the game
to the to the experience
players uh experience right now because
like we're the ones still playing
they they could have been in the womb
back then okay fair enough that's true i
was eight years old
bro that's crazy really
can you imagine being born in 2005
like the year that peter jackson's king
kong came out
it's not gatekeeping at all like why are
you why are you trying to bait like an
argument for no reason just saying you
know you got tens of thousands of people
that
played a ton of the game like when it
came out and have kept it going for like
seven years
i'd rather the difficulty for like the
super hard stuff be tailored in the
direction of
of the existing player base you know
this is late game content exactly
if you want a game where you can just
like feel good all the time and press a
button and win and get free dopamine
play among us
it's that simple
doesn't even make any sense but i'm
going to continue the feud with among us
because i can
okay we're going down
i think i'm gonna joke her right away
too
i'm glad we did because the x i don't
know how it's affected but i feel like
we're
we're better off having done it because
the xl floor might have screwed us
so incubus is incredible the problem
here though
is if we take another item and then take
incubus they're going to dynamically
adjust the price
of incubus so i think what we want to do
is just take incubus
mission accomplished
none of the other items in my opinion
were even worth
the life that they might have cost us if
we hadn't
bad stepped diagonally onto the spikes
in the first place you drinking coke
excuse me this is a pepsi product it's
called sparkling
strawberry bubbly
has nothing to do with the coca-cola
corporation who i'll remind you have
been
canceled this week this is a pepsi
corporation product it's completely
different
completely inverted sense of corporate
values
this is interesting got a lot of
consumables that does not happen very
often
on uh on repentance hard runs
can i definitely try and shoot the whoop
okay let let me think about this for a
minute we gotta good luck stead okay
we're gonna start
with this two of diamonds we're just
gonna pop that immediately
i can see forever also sick okay how do
we play this
we want hp basically
f you hate to see it
just give it a sec okay we got another
opportunity
maybe dude this is actually pretty sick
why did this man take soy milk uh it's
actually good now
it's a good item now
take me back again i don't know do you
think cherry doesn't last as long now
will you apologize to dan i'm gonna need
you to be more specific
what what do you need me to apologize to
daniel for for
just in general no we got a good rapport
if
if he wants me to apologize he would
bring it up for sure
he doesn't mind being forward about that
kind of stuff
okay lover's card into the blood bank
there's a chance
for saying he didn't know what he was
saying when he said soy milk was good
look you could forgive me for
[Laughter]
you could forgive me for thinking it
right yo this is good
keep it moving man like i
we normally we probably wouldn't keep
doing this because we would be like oh
we're stoked anyway
but now i'm like we gotta keep sending
it
no bomber boy
because uh you know we need all the help
we can get quite frankly
that that hurts but you know what if you
give me like crystal ball or something
i forgot what i was talking about a
second ago
store credit yes yes
maybe the crawl space stuff no like
again the thing is
and we we talk about this from time to
time you gotta choose like the amount of
um back seating that you take
a lot of like for isaac i'm very
comfortable with how i play
the back seating is insanely helpful
for things like you know hey you forgot
like a key on the ground or something
like that
but when i see something that's like
three lines long that's like actually
like you should be doing this instead of
this i'm like
don't worry about it man like i got it
don't don't sweat it the crawl space
stuff i saw
people were like you forgot a crawl
space in the mirror dimension
then i remembered like the last time i
had a a crawl space that provided me
with any
value whatsoever was before that uh that
guy
was born the one that was born the same
year peter jackson's uh
king kong remake came out and i realized
you know what maybe
at this point we're just gonna try to
keep some momentum instead of in making
sure that we've got
100 optimum uh plays at all times
interesting so midas touch is like
this mighty interesting but we don't
have invincibility
except from some bombs so i think we
kind of go i think we go right today
for sure i think we go right today
that's pretty good honestly
that's pretty good all right let's go to
the shop and then
i think we got a good run incoming
i can't see anything
because we're in the mine shaft i wonder
if that would hurt me or
or if i could ride it then i was
thinking like if i ride it to what
purpose
and there it really is zero so let's not
even worry about it
this seems like a very stable run i
don't know if it has
like the sustain that you know at my
current familiarity i would consider
uh necessary in order to get to the
final boss if it's even the final boss
but
i definitely think we have a chance i
definitely think there's a shot
i've really one of the things that's
helped me out a lot because i have put
up
some some minor dubs is like uh
is very helpful
we gotta fish for guppy for sure it's
very helpful
to play the game super conservatively
don't take you know middling deals with
the devil
don't leave the floor until you've like
exhausted
almost every possible way that you could
pick up
more resources particularly hp
i mean like we're playing as kane and
it's still like we're kind of on the
borderline right here
can't ride it confirmed
secret room secret room
no secret room you got a fish you got
you you
you want a cat you got to get some fish
okay take me out of here
you're right i have x-ray vision and
that's see
that's a good example of the back
seating
otherwise i might have fished for that
for another you know two or three
minutes
helps the one of the best ways to use
the back seating for a game you're
familiar with is the counteract streamer
brain
where you're trying to think about how
to like uh you know
pivot off of all this into a discussion
about whatever happened to the career of
breckenmeier
oh we skipped i see what happened here
okay hold on
give me that
these suck we remember that okay we
still gotta fight
the boss here and we gotta go to the
mine cart room
we have bomb immunity this guy cannot do
any damage to
us we're immune to your charms like the
wax
lips of of robin when he goes up against
poison ivy and joel schumacher's 1997
film batman and robin
don't even need to look at the screen
man
this is some serious damage okay
the lucky penny sound almost makes up
for it not being that good
i want this i want that
and i wa no wait hold on was there
another there is another emperor card
algiz is really good i wonder
hold on let's see if i'm a genius here
this would be a genius level play
okay does not work but you know what we
tested something
in my opinion should work but that's
fine uh we don't want fishtail no we
want the emperor card
my personal opinion that should work now
i understand why all the streamers are
mad
oh wait wait we gotta get the minecart
room
i don't know i think we've only had two
buttons so oh but you know what the
third button is always in the minecart
room
there's always money in the banana stand
i walked into the fire i apologize
no but i can understand like you know oh
it's a great idea hanged man for the
knife piece room
beautiful idea
i can understand why people are are i
don't want to say perturbed but like
here's the thing the public perception
was that like that's tempting too though
the public perception was that the uh
you know the game when
it was hard it was hard for like the
wrong reasons
you know not having too many items in
the game that like do nothing
they say two items i mean too many items
um
yeah plus they've never played mafia the
lost city of heaven
so to have like nerfs on good items
oh we lost our card okay to have
nerfs on good items that people thought
there was no problem with
uh i can understand why that would
frustrate some people but i also
simultaneously
understand that like maybe the reason
people had uh
no problems with good items is because
good items
you know when they make the run easy you
feel good
you go i'm so good i won
whereas when an item kind of sucks
you're like i'm great
it's this item's fault that i that i
screwed up
oh i have walked into the fire for a
second time
just a good example of what not to do
go ahead go ahead there you go
this part i i stand by the idea that i'm
probably the best streamer on planet
earth at this particular section
i have not watched any other streamer do
this particular section yet
but i feel confident nonetheless
go just go
[Laughter]
yo
never let ignorance get in the way of a
good opinion
saved i
there's a bomb back here maybe or
another button or something
i'm trapped oh you got to take the long
way home like super [__]
nope help
that that one i take a small amount of
issue with i felt like i was a little
bit
uh hemmed in there but that's okay saved
oh my god i got so much speed man
all right get me out of here hanged man
on the sacks
emperor card on the next floor
little under hp
nine lives makes it not so bad but we're
a little under hp'd here
if we could maybe pick up some uh like
an item that generated spirit
hearts uh for example
you know what let's uh
let's try to maximize our payouts here
you never know you could have gotten a
uh
magic mush mini mush any variety of mush
really
all right joanna won
i don't want to emperor out of here i i
want to get
okay those enemies shoot melee beams i
did not know that
okay okay uh i what are you
you you deflect extremely good to know
that sucked
this room sucks big time
fair enough honestly i was inundated
with new stimulus there
that was that was tricky
i will also say and this is you know not
to take the other streamers sides but
there are times when i'm playing this
game where i
get hit on a room and i just go you know
what
realistically i i can't be mad at myself
just there's so much stuff on the screen
like i don't think i could have possibly
realistically uh parsed what i needed to
do when i got hit there
oh my god it's so loud i that literally
just walked on the spikes
that one's that one's completely my bed
don't
but it's definitely tough like
particularly the alt paths
they have made the game confirmed not
easy
this would be a great time to get blood
bag oh i've been april fools by the way
people told me nl you can go down to
zero spirit hearts
or zero red hearts i should say
i have been pranked
that's a pretty good one though you got
me on that one oh you have to have
spirit hearts to do
it okay then that makes sense
bro come on now hey you oh
this guy hasn't watched 75 hours of
other streamers playing the game because
he's been too busy uh playing it himself
and raising his kid
come on man come on dog that's the
nastiest thing
yo is that not two steam sales
second steam sale i heard was nerfed and
it's uh
it only makes things 25 cheaper on the
second one
that's still pretty good
we do have 74 cents so maybe not like
hyper relevant right now
but it's still pretty good
but that third steam sale when you get
the 87
off oh baby
interesting temperance
you know let's see what this is
something's wrong
it's an interesting room to donate a
bunch of stuff
beautiful what's the the croissant the
croissant is mom's bracelet it lets you
throw
rocks
and bombs whatever you get um
you see what i mean about chat activity
being the ultimate cure-all
you know what hold on
i've got an idea you grab mom's bracelet
we use it to break every single cool
rock
and hopefully get something good
all right uh and hopefully get something
good
this is i mean i've i've lost a lot of
uh
lives and hp on this run to some simple
uh
mistakes
i think it's up to me to to commit to
this one
can you throw the pillars you know we
can test throwing the pillars for sure
you cannot throw the pillars
this one's going to require something
though we're not quite there
in the run like in terms of the quality
of it it's actually pretty good it's
just in terms of the the enemies are
even higher quality
if it were not for that we would be uh
we'd be okay we we probably need
sure why not um we probably need uh
i don't know like eight heart containers
would start to make me feel a little bit
more confident
charm of the vampires doing something i
i can't disrespect it
nah no thank you
oh i hate it
bombs are legit oh bombs are legit
though
okay we shouldn't have taken the spirit
hard yet um
the problem is like i could definitely
get into this room but i don't want to
fight
the boss right now but we only have
three rooms anyway so like
i guess we might as well i'm gonna pick
it up
and then we'll emperor out because i
mean you gotta like
the damage output is is crazy man like
when we actually get the enemy in our
sights
we're doing some serious work but you
know
i don't think i need to tell you we also
have a certain element of fragility
don't kill me not not like this
just get it in there okay we lived
and we got the matchbook incredible item
it's saved
well uh i would say for now
it this seems like a run where we are
just not possible it seems like a run
where we're fairly likely to have
performed well but die anyway we'll see
yeah unfortunately this is not mom's
knife it's it's a
it's a reasonable analog
they won't let me pick them up but i'll
tell you you know
23 bomber boy bombs
let's take a chance on this i wish i
knew how that abba song went there's all
this song
and it's when it when a new game's out
and it's dlc go to angel
rooms take a chance on me if you roll
your eye
you know what i mean
no all right that's fine too uh like i
don't know man shoot the whoops not that
good but neither is the bracelet
bracelet i think provided us with no
value
[Laughter]
like i'm just stunned we i don't think
we got anything out of the bracelet the
whole time
we did save some bombs but like
i uh it's true it's true there's
something to that
what was this again it was bad right
dad's key dude i'm gonna level with you
i don't know
eddie oh thank you for the raid daniel
thank you
love the equal smile we love the equal
smile here
um we're we're on a bit of a spicy one
we're on joanna too joanna oldson
i took dad's key just to get like funky
with him man like i don't know
shoot the whoop is fine but it's not
really doing a ton of damage because we
got
dan's favorite milk here
updated to your list when so and
previously i've said never
hey key items key synergy
locks have been real quiet since new
keys dropped
um previously my answer has been
never uh and like i'm done but i don't
know i even like entertained the thought
today of of going through the patch list
like something's happened to my brain
it's like wouldn't it be funny if i just
spent like three hours going through the
isaac patch list
uh giving my opinion on uh the changes
then i decided not to because i thought
it would be like
i'd rather just play the game
[Laughter]
but the the the isaac juices are
definitely flowing again
this is the kind of stuff you think
about now because an alt path run takes
three hours
let me in
purge does it with dota yeah but that's
because you know
i imagine if you're like a dota player
any opportunity you get to capture that
audience without having to subject
yourself to the game is like a huge win
i actually enjoyed uh isaac so
sorry purge it's it's meant to be
humorous i hope i hope it's taken that
way
i think they had a dota player would be
like yes i know nobody hates the game
more than us
you've got us nuns have it all right
sister act has been real quiet since new
nuns habit just dropped
not not my favorite bit of damage there
for sure but
you know it's the we call that the
glance tax
i mean we do not care at all about camo
undies
so we're taking the right item
i think i speak for the gallery when i
say
pog heavy pog
energy radiating out of the the core of
that item room oh it's good
okay i can't see the screen
so dodging is a little tricky but this
is pretty amazing
doesn't melt mom as fast as i thought it
as fast as i thought it would but
still really nice oh i didn't i only
thought you could do that if you had a
willing partner on the other side but
apparently not
that was mighty nice uh we take polaroid
i have no i what the heck is this uh
home
theoretical phd false phd
worst pills plus evil up
[Laughter]
so like all bad pills but we got some we
got spirit hearts
or demon hearts or demon heart at least
i mean this is pretty good
as long as you aren't concerned with the
bit rate
like it looks pretty good on my end
i don't know where to go
looks pretty bad on the stream i can
imagine that
i imagine you're probably uh you're
probably suffering a little bit over
there what the heck
all right here we go new is this the
final boss already now that i think
about it
looks great on 160p
dude boss is a little tough
enemies though insanely easy
yo soy milk uh tec
x unbelievable combo incredible
can i also tell you by the way i had a
run today you will not
expect you know what the hero of the run
was
uh isaac's jar of tears
for the first time in my entire life i i
had a run
the the the two most impo important
elements of the run
and i'm not being facetious at all were
marked and isaac's jar of tears i was
like
you know what ed you got me
my tier list has been real quiet since
item adjustments got dropped
keep it moving
i don't know how you got destroyed i i
don't think those enemies are supposed
to be destroyed by damage but i'll take
it either way
i'll watch that 100
click bait undefeated
false phd makes it so bad pills give you
a damage up
that's incredible that's amazing
i'm just i'm trying to set the stage by
the way
this run could still go
totally wrong like i still would bet
probably on losing to the boss
it's really good but like i'm
not that good at not getting hit
[Laughter]
if we had some more some more hp i would
feel more comfortable
i would be like i i would feel like we
got a pretty good shot
i mean i guess i can't say i feel like
we don't have a shot but
i feel like we uh we don't have a
guarantee yet
i don't think we're too far off but i
don't know
where's april fools on the holiday tier
list we we covered it a little earlier
in the stream today it's
certainly one of my least favorite
holidays for sure
and i mean you don't even get the day
off so it's like it's truly bad
bombs are somewhat precious but i gotta
give you a try here
okay that's helpful although i think we
might be taking a full heart of damage
from this guy so
well hold on if bad pills give you
damage let's put ourselves
on the path and then use it to see if we
get damaged
i just want to get on the path first
blow him up good one
it's only stat pills that do it okay
thank you thank you
appreciate it
come on man come on
there we go wow it's mama mega dude
oh no i've uh obliterated you
dude the new effect is actually awesome
that's so cool
it doesn't blind you anymore it's like a
cool shock wave that's neat
that looks really cool they did a great
job with that
this would be embarrassing huh i mean
the door was already open
oh see ya
what the heck you made me use my
incredibly overpowered synergy you jerk
well it would be
okay it would be awesome if it also did
a ton of damage to this boss
i really want to go to the secret room i
don't think i can justify it
take auroboros it would be sec i'm going
to be honest i don't know what
the what auroboros does
and i don't consider to be an accurate
description
why not i mean we got 36 keys we're
chilling
how are you supposed to dodge that
oh i almost got out of it man
come on
okay that was spicy
that is playing super hexagon
i don't like the damage downgrade but
i'm extremely stoked
to have gotten an extra hard container
okay pill didn't oh the pill gave us a
demon heart
dude that's incredible
it's extremely valuable it works
okay oh yeah yeah okay so the the the
shots that i said you can't dodge that's
because they're ours
meme pills give you hp
i don't know what i was hit by but i'll
i take responsibility i take full
responsibility for it
i'm flooded there have been a a couple
of times
in in repentance where i've just been
like i have no idea
like i i just take damage and i'm like i
thought i was standing in like a super
safe place but apparently not
it's good and it happened to me in in uh
rebirth and after birth as well
it's just like what happens until you
get uh
until you get used to what's on the
screen
you know you gotta learn like all those
little edge cases
i do love that we can just destroy these
guys that makes life a lot easier
okay am i prepared for a boss fight
why not man why not uh
i'm gonna explore a little bit more i've
decided
apropos of nothing at all i've decided
that it would be
beneficial for us to do a little
exploration not related to the room i
just saw
just in general i think it's a failure
to plan as a plan to fail
what happened to mama mega uh so mama
mega at
i mean it appears that this is how it
works in this game too uh in
the dlc mama mega only works for one
floor
it's like super amazing for one floor
and then on the next floor you're like
i wish it was here okay we have nine
luck
algiz would go a long way right now man
two blood banks plus algaes thank you
thank you
it's tough to play both of those right
now but we'll we'll see
we'll see if we might be able to finesse
it
so it's not my first time on that but uh
on that boss that we're about to
approach
i did almost say on that bus that we're
about to approach
um we almost won yesterday i think it
was our first or second run
but the boss ended up just being a
little a little too difficult for us
i'd say our damage output is much higher
today
[Laughter]
uh hp i'm still kind of on the fence
dude guppy would really tie this run
together man
well we could take half damage from the
curse room but
son of a
well um
i think we just have to go i hate to say
it i think we gotta go
you blow these up
thought about the curse room decided
against it
i'm gonna take hanged man into the boss
fight
any chance you give me anything of value
okay literal money is not what i meant
but that's okay dude that's
really good and actually i'm very stoked
i got it now
instead of on the blood bank because i
would have used it on the blood bank
oh we don't want hanged man now um
when instead what i should be doing is
using it on the boss i think
it's one hp yeah and we're on like the
final room of the game
it's it's it matters man
we might still die but it gets us a
little closer
all right here we go here we go you know
how to dodge these
in in theory sonoma
only in theory unfortunately knives
coming out
when people get desperate the knives
come out there you go you never want to
snakes on a plane literally
geometrically speaking
you you never want to be up against the
wall
versus knives
you always want to give yourself some
verticality to dodge
okay not not my finest moment
all right we're toasted
say temporarily saved respond
hold on hold on
there's there's ways out
plus one to lowest stat okay it's
actually like a sizable damage
improvement
okay
then i'm like i'm trying to figure out
how we're gonna get through the cursed
room
because don't we take one full heart
from a hit
the problem is so we we if we walk in we
die
if we hanged man walk in
when we walk out we'll die but then we
could probably leave
if we go fast enough because of iframes
maybe we're going to die to the boss if
we don't try anyway so i think it's got
to be done
we're guppy so that's pretty sick um
and that's more hp that's actually like
a pretty realistic chance of victory i
would say now
oh it's true we could have bombed our
way out if we had to as well all right
so that
you know dying on that boss fight might
have been like the best thing we ever
could have asked for
unbelievably saved
okay then just be smart you got snakes
we got knives knives you want to be up
against the wall
but on the on the side instead of on the
bottom we love invincibility around here
flies are doing great work we're not
gonna lose
from making you know
mediocre dodges the only way we lose
here
is by really really throwing
by not making an effort by making poor
plays
i don't know what's happening
snakes many many many snakes
saved
okay this is like not dodgeable
uh by anybody except for me
okay didn't see that one coming
how are you alive just just asking
for a friend only a friend peter parker
he's dead he's dead he's dead confirmed
dead
my god okay all the achievements in
earth's history
have been unlocked guppy's eye
jacob and esau isaac's awakening a
strange door
seeing double
new cutscene new cutscene just dropped
edmond's been real quiet since this
stream
what are you started isaac let me see it
give it to me now
this is what you think of me
this is what i am to you a monster
no no mama after all
i've done for you bonk is how you view
me
you think i'm a monster isaac i'll
show you a monster
you are just like your
father i can't even look at you
the run was pretty pog though thought
the run was pretty
pog ending a little sag but the run
itself was
there was it was heavy on the pog right
ender engine thanks for the gifted subs
by the way
thank you
he's done it again guppy's eye has
appeared in the basement
you've unlocked jacob and esau you've
unlocked isaac's awakening you've
unlocked seeing
double you've unlocked a strange door to
the bank that appears in the depths
well i mean we gotta we gotta try the
new character



all right we're back with the a brand
new repentance run where kane
if you predict the item it's very simple
one thousand gift subs in chat
i'm gonna say it's nearsighted friend
okay that would have been devastating
i did not mean to say one thousand
i meant to say 100 1000 would have
scared the crap out of me uh
if we had actually gotten it correct i
felt my heart rate spike about 15
beats per minute i honestly got mildly
afraid
now you might have many questions about
this run you might say to yourself or
you might you might say
uh is he gonna do the alt path
it's been suggested is he gonna beat the
game on his very first attempt as kane
stranger things have happened um but
really like we're gonna do our best
and that's that's basically it we're
just gonna do our best
you know if if we can get the resources
required to go to the alt path and it
seems like we can survive on the alt
path
then we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
give it the old college try
like right off the bat you won't see
this play on any other twitch channel
nailed it crushed
like it or not you watched that's all
you could do thanks everybody
okay give me a slice of that
a key definitely makes the alt path
possible
loving the red fires hmm
he's ascended no pot is safe from him
anymore
seven cents we can't do anything man we
can't do anything
have you ever played a trick on somebody
for april fool's day
um i'm sure i have like for anybody
watching
later like uh
april fool's day is today i haven't uh
played a a prank on anybody recently i
find april fool's day this is not going
to surprise anybody who knows what i'm
you know like
i find april fool's day like really
annoying
that's not to say that there's not um
the occasional good april fools
that is like like what do i want out of
an april fools what what for me
personally makes a good criteria
it's a prank that gets you for a second
because it seems plausible
but doesn't alarm you you know like so
i kind of thought that like joke from
software one
was like pretty good today where they
were like they released that
apology about how like eldon ring was
canceled
and then there's like a finance youtuber
i watched who like
his video today was like finally
revealing my full
portfolio but actually it was about how
he was launching like a ponzi scheme
and i was like that's pretty clever and
like a lot of work went into this
but you know so many of the april fool's
day
hmm jokes are like
we're making a poop flavored beer and
i'm like no you're not come on
you're not making a poop flavored beer
you did it 30 years ago when you
invented
bud light
anyway oh we have fun here let's let's
go down a floor
um already making moves
so the the i actually can also pinpoint
like where i lost hope in in april
fool's day
it's when i was in like fourth grade
and the joke going around my playground
was about the russian
space station mirror
kid on my playground was like did you
see that the russian space station
uh crashed into the hotel do hospital
and i was like what and then he's like
april fool's and i was like guess what
i'm i'm done with this holiday now
i don't i don't respect it anymore
no mirror is a i keep saying it wrong
but it's it's a 90s thing
you couldn't shake a stick in the 90s
without hearing about the russian space
station
you pranked me you see i i saw in chat
somebody said uh
it makes uh luck foot makes all pills
positive now
april fools
i gotta tell you like the the front half
of the year
sucks for um holidays man
new year's day whatever okay after new
year's day
valentine's day look i'd celebrate
valentine's day
kate and i have a good time it's not an
inclusive holiday it's not for everyone
we're going left on this one
for sure right after that you get st
patrick's day
extremely fake holiday right after that
you get easter
good holiday but i wish they could just
pick a day that it actually like takes
place on
in may in canada we get victoria day
which is like basically just a holiday
to get
trashed and i think like i said this in
one of the isaac episodes coming to the
end of like uh
you know after birth plus is run i was
like come on
queen victoria she died like 130 years
ago or something like when are we gonna
reach the point
where we're just like i'm okay not
calling this victoria day anymore like
we we got
other heroes that we can acknowledge
okay queen victoria
we we can leave her in the past a little
otherwise like we're going to be
celebrating
victoria day in like the year 3000 i
don't think so man
like get her out of there i'm not even
saying necessarily because she has like
a problematic legacy or whatever i'm
just saying like we got to make some
space for
for modern heroes
in quebec it's patriots day you know
what
i'll give that some respect at least at
least you're you know it's acknowledging
the people instead of just like
you know some uh lady also known as the
queen i guess who lived in
england
i'll be honest as well i don't really
know what like queen victoria did for
canada
probably tricked a bunch of her people
into like moving here even though it was
like
inhospitable and frozen nine months a
year
there you go glenn gould day
one of canada's preeminent pianists
oh this is the greatest second room i've
ever seen in my life
no cap as the kids say what an
incredible room
i'm not used to being able to play uh
isaac with spirit hearts i did so many
bethany runs earlier today
yeah i say
[Laughter]
people complaining this dlc is too hard
um
try having the d12
it's easy i'm surprised there isn't don
cherry day
yeah it's pretty embarrassing uh
sometimes
like in in the mid 2000s they did a uh
like uh uh please vote for the greatest
canadian and then they had like a
reality show where they revealed the top
ten
and don cherry uh came in like seventh
he's literally just the guy that like
talks about hockey
in between the first intermission or in
between the first and second periods on
saturday nights
he was he was going up against like you
know the inventor of uh
cultivated insulin and you know the
father of socialized medicine and stuff
like that is so embarrassing
he should have been number one easily
[Laughter]
for going look at him look at him good
old good old frederick banting let's go
go saskatchewan boy invented insulin
let's go
okay this would be a great time to beat
the odds can i tell you
something incredible earlier today i was
recording an isaac run
this is not material to the actual like
outcome of the run please move
um but i had a
4.3 percent chance
of a deal with the devil and i got it
and the item inside of it was actually
good
one in 25 shot and we we picked the
right number it was pretty sick
all right i lost just an embarrassing
amount of hp we beat the odds yet again
though
i'll take it absolutely i know it's been
a little nerfed but i'll take it
i'm feeling somewhat solid in this run
feeling somewhat solid
excuse me i deal with lower rates in uh
gentian impact every single day
uh what's the company that makes that
called again
i always get it confused with the twitch
emote of like yaya
me me hoyo me hoyo get purchased by a
public company challenge 2021.
all right we're almost at conjoined
macros i think it's a a good
idea i think i i will consider doing
dailies in the future especially when we
have long isaac days
um but i'm not gonna do it today because
i've been burned by the april fools
challenge like
seven times
it's it's the only like unfortunate
timing day
so many times like the
okay that's good to know the april
fool's
uh daily is like hey april fool's the
game uh
i was gonna say the game isn't any fun
today
but you know it's like six times in a
row that is like you know
hey there's no items anywhere have fun
good one
good one very good one
hilarious nick cannon is hilarious
anyway
what was i talking about oh don cherry
yeah not not a huge fan
honestly
isaac though big fan there's been some
scuttle but you know
people called the the new game and and
or the dlc in the patch
at least a little over tuned a little
over difficult
um just wanted to see what we got here
to be honest i'd be inclined to say uh
might be a little tricky for sure but i
also feel like uh
it's one of those things hold on am i a
genius i want to try something here
i think it's one of those things where
like gamers including myself
are uh uh resin resin
are constantly like maybe this won't
work maybe i'll die on the way out but i
think it's worth a try nonetheless i'm a
genius i'm the smartest
uh person on earth i don't want oh wait
people said betrayal might be good now
let's give it a try
um i lived
i do have steam sale you're not wrong it
a it takes some getting used to
but b uh jar of flies is pretty sick too
a it takes some getting used to new
enemies shot speed etc etc
uh but b also like gamers are not used
to not doing things the hard way you
know what i mean
like i i was out here being like wow if
i can't even beat the game they'd
probably tuned it too difficult like
it's not that i'm the best player on
earth but i've played so much of it
that you would think that like the
average player is going to be in a
really tight spot
and i realized it's because like i've
still got got the muscle memory of like
oh yeah i'll always go the alt path
always
uh you know take almost every deal with
the devil that exists and you know
you're dealing with
antiquated pride and and information you
know i think
around launch leech is pretty sick too
dude around launch it might be more
sensible to play a little bit more
conservatively while we we build up
those muscles you know
i hear you
imagine them playing the old mafia city
of heaven game
i have no idea what you're talking about
but the reference is so
specific that i have an incredible
amount of respect for it
the the way that you approached it
i could not possibly relate to the joke
less but i'm like you sound like you
know what you're talking about for sure
now this is the risky part okay because
like we could die
we get hit twice here we die we probably
won't get hit twice against this
uh this enemy they need a better class a
criminal
but there's some bosses that could hit
us two times
dude this this was a very good mirror
dimension
no doubt about that i'm feeling
pretty solid here the only thing i'm not
solid on is hp
so they won't they won't let you go in
the boss room huh they will let you go
into the curse room
that's my heart rate again spiked the
shop on the other hand though
is um it's always empty in the mirror
realm
also i think blue fires are like less
likely to pay out
okay we're good let's leave that was a
very solid performance there i'm feeling
solid
what was i talking about a second ago
you know we got enough keys let's let's
go with the demon's tail
baby's good honest i recorded an episode
this morning
uh the episode is like an hour and six
minutes long
and the baby was calm and like cool and
collected for almost the entire thing
i was a very proud papa
key word almost well i mean at the end
of the day she's still a baby you know
like
what are you supposed to do sometimes
she you know
defecates in her own underpants and then
she she complains about it which seems
pretty fair to me honestly
yo i'll do mod thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
not dodged not dodged
okay things are going to be tough down
here
i was glancing you can't this game has
anti-glance tech now
we gotta try man
death card car battery i don't know if
it'll actually do anything with this but
it's a thought that counts
i'm gonna die 100 win rate i'm not gonna
die
it's not gonna happen we have demon tail
guaranteed
zero death incoming okay we're gonna die
i have a a piece of advice for you the
advice is never go
to alt floors it's uh
it's a fool's proposition
i'll see you never no
not not to a single enemy
not to a single enemy i refuse
yo thank you for the gifted subs as well
thank you
moving on we got golden bombs
just drop a gold in there and then get
the heck out of town this is how we do
it
i do the only problem is like i don't
know how we're gonna get
uh
spirit hearts you know when you need red
hearts
they're usually right around the corner
when you need spirit hearts it's tough
man
that doesn't help
tinted rocks if they still worked would
be uh would be an option for sure
i'm a doubter here i mean this one would
would pain me a great deal
because this should not be a doubter's
paradise
this is a great run where we haven't
really been that uh
that pressed we've taken uh some kind of
dumb damage
been living most of my life living in a
doubter's paradise well
honestly i knew it was called i got i
froze i
froze okay try again
that hurts sad sad sadga
uh free stigmata if we can get a bomb
that's pretty good
gift subs no we we covered at the top of
the scree
the stream today we're not doing the
gift sub there's a launch promotion only
please don't die on the first room
bailey thank you for the gifted subs
gotta change the title
i did before we started the stream today
would you believe it
[Laughter]
imagine not being here for the start of
the the stream
and still begging for gift subs man
that's gotta hurt that hurts the
streamer
you're a johnny come lately and you're
like give me some free stuff this isn't
costco
okay if it was you'd be welcomed here
120 volt
i don't know what it does yet but i'm uh
i'm eager to see y'all basic
thank you as well thank you this is a
great item
incredible item
stand close to enemies yo that's pretty
sick
yeah if you get a gift sub make sure to
uh
to say thank you to the gifter in chat
it's it's only polite
oh because the title says 100 win rate
no i i covered that on twitter the
like uh 100 win rate is true
because the asterisk in the title is if
you had a good time
then it's a win or if i had a good time
it's a win
generic mike thank you as well thank you
much appreciated
oh the gifter you mean uh jesus christ
one and the same my man one and the same
always one of the things that we do a
lot around here is
praise the lord
and many people have asked me to change
that they're threatened by it because
the specter of beelzebub is is
you know around the world you've seen
the little nos x juice you know
just just another example um but i will
not be threatened in the
into ending my agenda of praising the
lord
that's why we're playing isaac is to
bring awareness to satanic issues
it's a very fitting game
all right alt path because you have to
you have to go alt path man
i think we got to go left here dude
that's number two
on rooms where i don't understand
enemies or in a game where i don't
understand enemies at all
uh because they're all brand new highly
valuable
have you won a run in repentance yet
some of you were not here at the top of
the stream and it shows
we had we got the first streak in
repentance history
oh thank you nazu as well thank you
doubters have been real quiet
since this dropped i can't i gotta stop
saying that
i keep saying it constantly
along with uh ooh and also uh
really oh because it's an xl floor new
blank just dropped ooh
tough times never last only tough people
last
that was like terrible right there
oh it's pretty good it came along at a
at a good time in my life
uh as well dude we need consumables so
that's good
because the baby can participate as well
that's scary like many times we'll just
be
hanging out and the baby will be like oh
and then i go and then kate laughs and
i'm like i'm a genius
oh and it destroys chat oh no no no
don't don't have fun uh nobody can read
my essay
come on guys this look okay i'm sorry i
shouldn't have made the joke at your
expense i'm just
i don't consider myself a streamer i
consider myself a
vibe creator and i i like the vibes we
get from ooh
i think we need that right now
tinted rocks please
tinted rocks please
tinted rocks please
i said vibe creator not
vibrator you you got me confused with
some other streamers on this platform
okay we come on just give me a red heart
you got nothing for sale
i want it all man just say it it's mouth
you gotta try and then i want the other
one as well this is why we
saved up in our donation machine so much
man
we needed stuff like that really like
there's no there's no anything dude
is this a secret room it's not i guess
i'll die
then
okay that's a good point tough times
never last only tough people asked
let's try to find some secret rooms here
i did not hear the fart at first and i
almost died as a result
you know what you're a genius if you
became the lost
at this moment you could have two hits
instead
of one
that's kind of genius
that also seems like something that
could actually be super valuable like
like not just on this run but in general
he's done it never mind
yes thanks the streamer wins again
we did it the isaac flowchart undefeated
yeah use resin i don't think so how
about i just uh be good
gets bloated beautiful absolutely
beautiful
number two probably the highest win rate
item in the game
destroyed destroyed pageant boy
ultimate item really smart to take that
eternal heart right off the bat too
no item has ever been better than this
i gotta stop skipping those man there's
some people are gonna lose their mind
i gotta stop skipping the the boss cut
scene
mommy that's a mom's heart attack dude
i have done no damage to you that
doesn't seem right
help oh cause are you do you heal from
the bombs
oh no no no no no my eternal heart
i just want to live man okay so i can't
shoot bombs
so let's just tap fire instead that's
fun that's a fun
that's a fun time the occasional uh
dude we got to get these flies out of
here
thank you thank you he's he's sucking me
up
get closer no i'm not gonna get closer
cause
i don't know how to dodge his attacks i
i know we got the voltage
but i'm not confident standing near him
see like that he could just release a
completely innocuous fart on us at any
given moment
that's all right we're gonna get a great
item here probably belly button
is my guess have you learned any
isaac boss names this is uh yeah raw
mega i think
do you forget the deal with the devil
i'm just happy we like survived there
tears upgrades pretty nice don't get me
wrong
okay we're gonna do i think i'm capable
of
no i'm gonna be honest i don't think i'm
capable of
uh of beating the boss uh
as the lost
but i do think i'm capable dude i'm so
not used to being able to see the mat or
being able to see the map like every
single curse
is uh is like curse of the you don't
know where the hell you're going
what happens if you have two item rooms
in the mirror realm
one of them is empty the other one is a
key piece i guess
chat i'm off to play a prototype game
for work
see you later uh excuse me macros did
you
just drop baldur's gate 4
announcement in chat
did you just accidentally leak baldur's
gate 4 coming out
confirmed on on twitch.tv slash northern
lion balder's gate four
divinity original sin battle royale
edition
no april fools this time i was gonna say
we promise we won't cancel this one but
that's
that's too far i apologize i will say
though i was very much looking forward
to that x-com divinity and
and you larian studios broke my heart
but
okay we can beat this guy we if we get
an amazing item
maybe we could beat the other boss but
i'm not optim
off oh jesus christ okay start again
start again



i am excited uh it's finally happened
new cover art and then also we've
unlocked jacob and esau they got three
plus one
and the damage is one plus three i don't
remember
how to play them all i remember is that
there's
two different characters
if one of them dies they both die oh you
can't get them like
stacked on top of each other anymore i
vaguely remember that
you know what i do remember trying to
get them like separated and then picking
up
two rooms two items simultaneously
by like getting them uh just desynced
enough that you can actually walk into
the items
uh one at a time or or at the same time
i should say
that still works too now um
i mean i don't i don't think control
changes it at all
um
hold control oh if you hold control you
can move one at a time
i see i see so you could that's how you
could position for the double
item room yo so that makes like the alt
path um
kind of interesting huh
i wonder if i could pick it up whoa
screw
let's go mission accomplished um
so on the alt path you can pick up two
items
if you i'm like i'm losing my mind
trying to focus on this
uh you could pick up two items one of
them always being the question mark of
course
that's an interesting thing to think of
though we gotta try
speed i don't think it matters too much
um
let's just give it to esau yeah they got
individual stats
so the stat screen i don't think it's
gonna be like the most effective uh
visual indicator
oh come on man
it's not co-op this is the new character
it's pronounced esau yeah uh esau
jacob and esau got him okay
we're gonna pick him up we're gonna
launch him on the bus okay
this is co-op co-op forever alone
surely those shots won't hurt me i'm
willing to put it to the test
saved okay come on man send some shots
down here
let's go it's not nearly as good as i
thought it would be
i don't know like i've i i remember i
did play a lot of anti-birth
like i'm i'm starting to get some muscle
memory back
i i purged it from my memory but i i'm
starting to get some muscle memory back
we'll split those speed upgrades up
evenly so nobody gets uh offended
thinking their
dad's favorite
great damage good damage from the spider
there i appreciate it
keep it go my deal with the devil
tears upgrade goes to the stronger uh of
the two
which is uh horn lord
well done okay let's do some more
exploration first
he has horns
so far every streamer has complained
about this character i'm glad to see
you're a little bit more reserved
uh that's not my personality i merely
recognize
like that sometimes there's some
arbitrage to be had in the market
when the streaming index goes too angry
i i find that that's an opportunity for
me to double down on wholesomeness and
and pick up
some uh some arbitrage there
uh and when streamers get too wholesome
that's where i pivot a little bit into
anger
um but it's also never happened in
history so
i don't have to worry about that just
yet
strategically deployed wholesomeness
exactly
um i would like to open this golden
chest
no no no he lived
say a funny funny man uh little miss
muffet sat on a tuffet eating her curds
away
along came a spider sat down beside her
and gave her a bone of his own
hey pretty good
pretty good
24-hour band permanent i mean i feel
like the
jar actually could be useful here so
just
can we hold two active items
it doesn't matter i think the jar is
actually better
okay we can hold two actives
why don't you buy that and buying stuff
from the shop what year is it but still
you know it's it's important for us i
think to get these for hp
more more xd thank you for the
gifted subscriptions thank you heading
down to the next floor tomorrow you want
to leave huh going down to the next
floor
24-hour band permanent is a dan
soundboard clip that comes from the
soulsborne streamer also warzone
professional the happy hog
all right all right take a look take a
little breather
little sip of the bubbly can in the
frame can in the frame
okay here we go
unfortunately i'm realizing now wait a
minute how do i deploy the jar
hold control and press space maybe i
gotta test it
oh frick
nope you have to press q okay
all right thank you thank you gotta
press
q
i do think that bubbly and i'm being 100
serious
they should approach camp low
to get the song or the rights to the
song
bubbly because literally the start of
the song just goes like this
got the bubbly pulling through me got
the bubbly
pouring through me sparkling you know
like that's literally
that's what they sell man sparkling
water
it would be perfect it would be a
perfect fit
all right i'm about to become an angry
streamer
because we're gonna die as uh
esau which will end the run i'm sure
your perma band
there you go synced up synced up
come on man i don't i don't want to get
in there

a bomb now honey
dead bird irrelevant 24-hour band
permanent
this this character is going to throw
you for a loop but i pride myself on
having an above average amount of
neuroplasticity for a 32 year old man
we'll see
i think i got a chance
the bomb play disagrees oh yeah this is
doing numbers
what boss did you fight on the last
floor
ragman yeah
i've been i've been playing brain age
ragman and who uh
right it was an xl floor i recall this
it was little horn
confirmed brain is operating at 100
efficiency today
i will take why not he knows
he knows hold on where did i get 20
cents
okay maybe i shouldn't have said that
because i people thought i remembered
what was happening on this run
when did i get all that money though oh
you got a dime all right
take care of the dimes and the pennies
take care of themselves
a single key no two keys give me two
keys please we need to buy
a bomb we also need to purchase a second
key from the shop in order to
go to the shop because we have money but
then we also want to use the key to get
to the alt floor
maybe we won't go to the all floor on
this floor maybe we'll go to the all
floor on the next floor and we
will only get screwed if it's excel
that's not so bad maybe he can't even
get screwed if it's excel i don't know
man
yeah yeah the streamer sees the copy the
copy pasta i don't know
you know what is it gonna take man
what's it gonna take to
to get it to stop i've seen it though
like you're doing right now
say electrical inference etc etc like i
don't know
i don't know what you're looking for man
except for a 24-hour ban permanent
you know what hold on wheel of fortune
how do we use wheel of fortune hold this
then hit q
how does one use the the card
oh the first shop's open
you're absolutely right x
no doesn't x mean that it's the tenth
tarot card
yeah yeah it's the tenth tarot card
i'll take a little stem sale no doubt
about it
it's control space
okay you need like a steel battalion
controller to to play this
i don't understand
plug in the hottest i still got the
logitech plugged in
get ready to run
i i held control as if i would become
esau and i did not
i got it backwards sorry we split it
though
i'm going down yeah yeah cause we can't
get a key anyway or we're not likely to
get a key
mom turns mom says it's my turn to get a
spirit heart
i gotta i mean the only thing i'm
thinking here is control space it is
control space how about that
who would have thought oh baby two
trinkets
dead bird and eve's birdfoot
we're saved man officially saved
mods appreciate you appreciate you
don't hesitate like dude honestly like
the more bands you give out
the more i get to do on band requests
and then like double mind the content
it's basically like a dream come true
i've still i haven't read apollo's ban
uh on band requests i like to start my
morning by reading them when i get a
chance but
um i didn't get a chance this morning
unfortunately but
i guarantee they're gonna be good we
might as well give this to
you um because like yesterday was the
first day of the new among us map
there's gotta be
like i i don't even wanna know what kind
of terrible stuff went on in the band
request yesterday
we're gonna get some like self-aware
band requests i'm sure as well like
people are gonna get banned and then the
on band request is gonna be like
i got caught up in the excitement
thinking i would get on the stream for
on band requests but i didn't realize
that he wasn't gonna do it for six weeks
and now it's two weeks later and i can't
chat i thought he was gonna do the unban
requests right away
just chill out you know pop a squat get
a snack
if you if you're bored and you got a
copy pasta like you could just
here's my advice you know like go get uh
an
open a notepad document and just uh
ctrl c ctrl v into the the notepad
document over and over
you'll get the same level of streamer
interaction
and and you won't have that that regret
hangover in the morning
okay this was a very good floor uh
we don't have immediate health concerns
so red you take
and you take the spirit hearts as well
i would say both even though you have
the respawn i would say both
and then this is bad
let's get deals with the angel we do
kind of want to take the alt path
but
[Laughter]
i don't know we got to get a key first
before we worried about uh before we're
worried about that okay there's a key
check this out and check check this out
check check check out my melody
run
dude yeah i think esau is pretty strong
now
what was that devil deal that was it was
terrible man
like
i can't believe it the quarter and ouija
board
that's like a flash devil deal
the burpee cloth okay i will give it to
you i have to warn you
there is a little coffee spilled on this
side
but it should be clean enough for her to
throw up on it
i mean you got to keep it in perspective
right
what was the last boss you defeated
come on man i can't remember that
that was that was seconds ago
i don't want to constantly be uh
attacked on my memory here like that's
that's too much
in order for the the banter to flow the
memories gotta go
you know you can only choose a few
things everything's got trade-offs
i'm here to tell you though i have a
real uh opinion on memory
now my opinion on memory is valueless
because i'm not like a cognitive
scientist
or a neurologist or anything i i do
definitely think your memory gets worse
as you age
as you age due to like philosoph
physiological changes
okay however i also think one of the
reasons
that your memory gets worse as you get
older
is because you actually just have stuff
going on in your life whereas like
you know when you're like 14 years old
it's a lot easier to remember things
because
you know you've like your life is low
event for the most part
like i think the reason that adults have
run into trouble
a lot of the time is you know memory
wise because of the fact that they've
like oh
and then i gotta oh we got to renew our
car insurance on the weekend and then we
got to do
i've got to get dinner tonight but oh i
didn't get the artichokes so i got to
stop by the grocery store on the way
home
uh and then also like you know blah blah
blah you get the idea and plus i'm going
to work you know i forgot to respond to
that email
etc etc um whereas like when you're uh
well at least when i was like 16 it was
like a get on the school bus at
like 7 45 a.m and then you know
just go to your classes and then you're
pretty much set honestly my man you're
pretty much set
okay check this out check this out
you put this guy over here
you walk him down and then for the price
of one bomb
we get a secret room and a spear spirit
heart
well well well
it's a good idea though you got to admit
and then hold on i mean if you're going
to use one bomb
you might as well do this right like
look at he's a genius man he's the
smartest gamer
yeah yeah yeah we'll do it
now we have no bombs unfortunately
though um
what about the 70 year old who has
nothing to do well again
you know i baked that in earlier with
physiological changes of course
but then secondarily i also think that
like when you're older
it might be nice to just okay i'm
phrasing but like remembering
minor things who needs it man you're
like i already went through the
workforce
now i'm retired and you know it's time
for me to just get like
lazy
you know if i'm 70 and they're like hey
well you know oh would you have for
lunch last thursday i'd be like i don't
need to
i don't need to know that anymore
i filled up my rrsp i i did my time
i paid my taxes and now now it's time to
just live day to day
help help me
should we have elective officials over
the age of 70.
um yeah
for sure um i'm being very serious about
this
obviously i think i think that it should
we should go back to like the roman
consul system there should be the
the only leaders of the free world
should be
the oldest living person because they've
got the most experience
and the most recent baby born because
they have the freshest perspective
okay check this out you ready for this
kate
you ready for this
[Laughter]
gaming
you see everybody in chat going no no
that's not how it works
embarrassing
they i agree honestly they're so easy to
say
like they say no without even thinking
about it
they never say whoa and honestly that's
one of the big problems with today's
society i think
hello baby
oh what kind of outfit she got on today
oh look at that
how do uh if people are watching from
home how do they cop the fit
cop the fit
if they're watching from home how do
they cop the fit how do they buy it
yeah like you know steal this look
go to the baby store and buy it go you
heard it here first go to the baby store
and buy it
oh uh chariot sucks my mistake chariot
officially
bad i'm trapped in in a nightmare
okay what if you have two cards how do
you use
the the esau card if it's not control
space
it's there's so many buttons man
it's control q okay okay sure
i got it i get the picture dude i'm
telling you
like this is gaming
officially gaming
whatever he got his hp back and we got
the second secret room
don't care didn't ask plus i got the
second secret room
well we don't even need to use a bomb
here i feel like i've seen this dlc
about
uh four or five years ago well you know
kate
you know what we don't need right now is
more negativity around
after waiting uh seven years for the
final isaac dlc to come out a little
more
negativity about it
i don't think that's necessary
insubordinate and churlish
wait a minute wait didn't i
i think i fought this boss four seconds
ago
did i not just fight this boss
[Laughter]
it's a rematch oh okay how about that
well flush him again there he goes get
flushed
way to go dummy you just got flushed
great item pretty excited um
kate i don't want you to weigh in by the
way on the discussions that we're having
about uh
whether or not i have dementia i do
i do forget things from time to time
but in my defense some of the things
that i forget
i don't really like want to remember
i i do think we're probably gonna die
right here by the way we're gonna give
it a try regardless
pov you are poop in the turret
this will work i'm dumb
saved
anyway i forgot what i was saying
oh sometimes i don't want to remember
yeah because it well i don't know like
sometimes
and don't uh take this the wrong way
kate but sometimes you'll like tell me
something
but you'll nest it inside of a story
and it just doesn't fit in my brain that
way like if you're telling me a story
and then like halfway through the story
you're like
it's like a trap you're like by the way
remind me at 11 13 tomorrow i gotta call
like the hair salon
and then you keep going on with the
story like by the time the story's over
i've already forgotten
the the thing i was supposed to remind
you
i don't think his dad brain i think it's
like you you try to hit me with like a
brain teaser
i'm dead i'm gonna die i'm dead dude
this isn't
i'm alive i'm the lost
well i might as well try to fight the
boss
head eyes
that's now this because we had lazarus
rag dude i'm a genius
be flipping yeah yeah they're like
all right get ready
i was looking up like baby milestones
this morning
because i was like i want to know like
how how she's doing relative to other
babies and it was like 10 milestones
your baby must meet
and she crushed it she was like it was
like at two months they should look you
in the eyes and i was like
done and it was like i have four months
like they should respond to
when you smile that was like easy and
i think it was like at six months she
should uh
i forget like like grasp things with
their hand and i'm like come on
yeah in the 1200s or are you talking
about elo
firm handshake that's that's next firm
handshake
that donkey that donkey donkey dunk
it's easy i can tell you what boss i
fought i don't remember their name
but it's uh bad uh
poop i can tell you because i fought
that boss
three boss fights in a row for some
reason
hello oh what a cute baby
what the cute baby
where am i going oh well
please
oh you tried to buy some netflix stock
yeah okay
yeah you got to be uh you know careful
with stuff like that because if you put
the wrong
uh you put like one extra zero on your
limit buy you could accidentally pay
like
10 times what a stock is worth
or sell it for uh one tenth of what it's
worth is the alternative but
what what has you uh feeling positive
about netflix kate because i gotta tell
you i'm in the opposite camp
well but if i tell you how many people
are watching this
this might be a i don't think that that
enough people are watching this to
materially move
the position of netflix stock actually
but between you and me or between you me
and chad
yeah sure why not so
just last year
okay did they buy the penthouse is the
penthouse coming in netflix korea
but then uh they're very investing 51
million back
into like the growing netflix korea
okay you're like those pubs that you can
create like a studio
okay
i uh you know i think there's a chance
for netflix to to get stronger in korea
every time i open the app it shows in
languages that i don't speak
tomorrow you can't get in the chords man
i uh my personal opinion on netflix is
netflix uh
bad disney plus uh pog
but if they make a queen's gambit too
perhaps i might consider uh reinvesting
if you have thoughts on this subject
oh you know what
yeah it's like 400 bucks right 500 bucks
whoa wow
by the way this run is like toasted it's
going nowhere
i gotta i gotta focus a little bit more
on the run or
like i'm i'm definitely just gonna like
afk
idle myself into oblivion
i don't know how we're making it out of
this one
okay goodbye baby
bro i'm gonna die i also have no idea
like because i just took amnesia did i
even see the item room on this
floor was it uh was it my best friend
whatever just kill me
[Laughter]
okay sure yeah you can summon spikes
from the ground and all that okay cool
cool cool all right
well let's run it back try it again



i like the idea of this character
that's not even meant to be like
facetious like i think there's some cool
mechanics
you know like getting two bombs for the
price of one is pretty sick
very difficult as well though i did
somebody
it was mur salty on on twitter they were
like you gotta go back to fortnite look
at this abomination they just added
and they added um they call it diamond
hans
it's
the stonks guy from the meme you know
like the guy
the guy with the smooth head that's in
the suit going stocks
so you could have diamond hans
and uh and the alien xenomorph and
chun li on a squad together
and then when you win you could all do
the orange justice together which is and
and kratos and the mandalorian yeah
i don't know i think it's kind of sick
my my uh judgment on that is that i
think it's kind of sweet
i mean they've really like just gone oh
my god
just do it man they've they've gone
fully into like
you know absurd like fan service
territory
it's money equals power that's
incredible and
i'm kind of here for it honestly
they've gone country now if they could
just make the
uh if they can make the default mode
no building
that i would i it could become my main
game
no sweat mode yeah you know what i mean
this stonks guy
that guy stonks
i did see that that netflix bought
knives out
two and three for 400 million dollars
it's a lot of money for sure but i think
it's uh
i i here's the thing knives out one
fun movie had had a good time watching
it and i could totally see how they
could use um
you know that as a platform to kind of
launch a franchise of
daniel craig's character
i'm willing to give it a try at least
for sure
why not
why is everything got to be a franchise
not everything you know maybe just like
just knives out
whatever you're just gonna you know
download it off the pirate bay anyway
what are you complaining about
oh i wish they made more uh original ips
for me to steal
what the heck is soap
hold on maybe it's hp tears and shot
speed
i don't mind having that on non um
non bomb man
i think i'm gonna go
i think i'm gonna do normal path
realistically
i don't think we're gonna live on
non-normal path
i think it's good for us to go this way
instead we would
we would definitely get double items if
we went
uh alt path but
i think we just need to get some stuff
knocked off the post-it note get some
confidence
get some you know momentum get some
familiarity
okay this is an important one
[Laughter]
this should go to you
are you gonna watch
kong vs godzilla i i
saw godzilla
2014.
short fuse faster explosions that seems
terrible
or awesome i don't know uh i i saw
half of skull island
and was like this seems okay
help i saw half of
uh godzilla king of the monsters and i
said this does not seem like it's my cup
of tea
so i think i will skip godzilla versus
uh
versus kong i'm not i'm not the target
audience
is it on streaming services though i saw
some people in the u.s watching it on
their home
entertainment systems it's on hbo max
oh yeah i got hbo max
i still probably won't watch it but
well it's not hbo max here it's crave i
got nothing against it's just not my cup
of tea you know
it's not never i've never found uh never
found myself
involved in the in the the kong fandom
or uh godzilla for that matter
i believe is good don't get me wrong why
does some minecraft streamer i've never
heard of have 200 000 views
because you're old like and i don't mean
that in a negative way
at all but i had the exact same
experience myself
i don't know maybe like a month ago
there was a streamer
that i've never heard of they were live
they had
200 000 viewers and they were the
subscribers
were coming in so fast nobody could type
in chat
and i said to myself for a brief moment
i said how do i not know i've never
heard of this person before
and it's it's very simple they're like
18 and you're probably like in your late
20s and the internet's big
and you know it's uh
there's a whole new crop uh you know
streamer idols coming out
okay give me stopwatch give me spirit
heart
it's impossible to keep uh to keep up
with it i promise you
you just got to pick this this the part
of the internet that you're like uh
a fan of and and just you know stay
i mean you could always you know grow
like get new experience and stuff like
that but
i did have a dream that i made friends
with one of the minecraft
uh youtubers i have no idea which one it
was
i'll leave that up to dreamlands
but i just remember being like you know
in the dream i was like hey
cool minecraft
[Laughter]
yeah it was it was it was sips for sure
his name is sips homing familiars
you wanted to do the normal path
don't make fun of me i'm old also this
runs easy now we'll win
no problem i need the double items
this is the shop
the tower no thank you
yeah sips is a he's an og minecrafter
man
no no doubt about it
if anything in the dream i should have
given up my friendship slot
that's just not the right way to phrase
that
i should have given him the opportunity
to uh
be friends instead of me but
okay this this deal with the devil could
be
could be important hold on empty vessel
on uh on esau
that's that's top tier he's gonna get a
lot of invincibility now
um

congratulations or whatever
one of my favorite memes you know what
uh what april fool's prank i'm the most
annoyed by
and i get that this is like extreme old
energy
but like every year there's like a
streamer that is like i don't know how
to say this but and then it's a twit
longer link and then the twit longer
link is like
gotcha that's the one that one drives me
crazy man

april fool's day so
and you know i give him a little bit of
credit

hello welcome i don't know how this is
like the seventh time i've let you in
here today
yeah curse of the tower ruined one of
our runs yesterday how how quickly
people forget man
but on the uh oh uh not uh
edmund on the podcast said it would be
good come
on man who are you going to trust about
something isaac related
me or the guy who made the game
[Laughter]
easy decision
well i would say already today
the stream has been good hit good hit
has been a success
simply because of the the unlocks we got
you know and and particularly the new
character but
i'd like to make it even more successful
if possible
fate's reward and the body now that's
good eats
okay all righty
that's a big item and then i don't even
know what this does
teardrop charm i can't shoot anyway but
bro i don't even trust you on sandwiches
okay then like just
you stand there in your wrongness and be
comfortable with it okay
if you don't like a cuban sandwich stop
acting like the problems with me
bro you did you did egg salad dirty bro
bro eggs egg salad people are gonna
really light you up over that one
come on
anybody else feel like my final was egg
salad against cucumber
with the crust cut off
that's what you sound like in my head
okay i uh
yeah look listen to how mad you are
right now
it's my favorite it is
i win the argument because like oh my
god you're so mad
i want to know what your problem is with
with chicken salad
i i really don't like heavily mayonnaise
driven salads
i don't mind when mayonnaise is in the
sidecar
just get hit okay like it's going to
happen
i don't wan i don't mind when mayonnaise
is in the side car
but i i do not like when the mayonnaise
is in the driver's seat
and on chicken salad the mayonnaise is
honestly is like elon's self-driving
algorithm
because it's driving and also driving
badly
going over the lines and
can't make a left turn when the sun is
like you know facing the direction of
the windshield
i see progress has been made today don't
patronize me
corey rude
look who decided the adult today it's
so rude man
look who decided to come out of his cave
not patronizing i was mad at this game
last night
okay fair enough i i apologize
what the uh spikes man who made this
yo it's easter this weekend huh what's
up with that
i'm gonna die
it's what yeah like you know what i mean
like it's easter dude
that's crazy what do you mean what's up
with that
well i mean what i said dude what's up
with that
who decided on that one
jesus no that it's bs man okay this
battery pack
also confirmed not very good
but isn't like i really just wish
i'm being straight up i don't know maybe
you have some insight corey on this one
why don't they just make easter like the
the third of april every year or
something like that
why do we have to go through an
algorithm
every year just to understand what day
easter is
this but for all holidays because it has
to be on a sunday
okay could you make it just like the
first sunday in april then
like why why is it sometimes in april
and sometimes in march
i'm not trying to cause problems here
but like when jesus you know
uh rose himself from the dead was he
like
did he put it like into a reverse
engineer
and go like uh
you know oh well let me find some
arbitrary rule
it's the third monday unless there was a
quarter moon
it's never in march you guys are
actually crazy
it's in march there have there have been
easter's in march
you know what let me i'm gonna look it
up here
when is easter
okay sunday how is easter's date
determined
it always comes the first sunday
hold on always
occurs the first sunday after the pascal
full moon
the first full moon that appears
after the vernal equinox which signifies
the beginning of spring in the northern
hemisphere
actually the dumbest way to
uh predict a holiday i've ever heard in
my life
truly insane what is this like saturn
alia
i need bomb synergies dude this could be
sick i do need to find a way to kill you
first though
okay here we go
let's go
[Laughter]
that's huge okay control space
very natural keyboard maneuver there to
get that out there hey
lucky penny dude no complaints
that was easy much easier than expected
but like there have i i mean i remember
that's not a great source
dude just trust me there have definitely
been
easter sundays in march
i'm not saying it's common but
it's happened easter was march 27th in
2016.
this one goes out to everybody in chat
who just typed five question marks
maybe maybe they weren't alive back then
we got a lot more viewers than usual
it's possible we got a different
audience
excuse me
rabbit's foot panic button push in case
of emergency i will not
my birthday falls around easter oh were
you born
on the 40th day following the vernal
equinox which signifies the start of
spring
in uh the northern hemisphere your
driver's license must be like the size
of a damn billboard
name john last name doe
uh date of birth you may want to sit
down for this one
okay i have no idea what that item is
it's a red balloon
like from i think you should leave
bring back decimal weeks
okay vasculitis clogged enemies and also
anarchist cookbook like this is now just
reaching comical levels
that might be the funniest joke i've
ever heard remember when that guy asked
me to do a funny let's just pretend that
instead of um
what i said which was an andrew dice
clay joke
let's just pretend that i said that cool
joke about like when that guy was born
instead
because that would be that was much
funnier for sure
i don't really like dull razor here i'm
just being straight up with you
that was just really bad
dull razor is just gonna trigger curse
of the tower more often
what the which is the exact opposite of
what i want i wish i'd never gotten the
item in the first place
oh it hurts daddy when you say that
nl i tried to listen to joanna newsom
but she's not on spotify what the heck
man
yeah i don't know she doesn't like
spotify um
which i i don't get me wrong i can
understand
but the thing that surprises me is that
she she's not down with spotify
but she's totally on youtube music and i
i'm kind of like i don't want to say
that because i don't know if she knows
that she's on youtube music
and i like to listen to her songs so i
don't want to like blow up
my own spot you know what i mean
well this was a very solid boss fight i
thought we did a great an admirable job
here
here we go again corey you got something
to say
what is it is it bone marrow is it
brittle bones
is it calcium is it uh you're the expert
this is a call back to yesterday
small bony hp up i believe this is one
empty bone heart
nl merch just arrived yo dhl has been
real quiet since the nl merch arrived
or something
yeah so like not all of the merch is
shipped
so if your merch has not gotten shipping
info don't sweat it
there's still there's still a ways to go
uh tiny still is still working the
the printers in overtime you know the dj
khaled
meme where he like you know it's like i
called apple to get more servers
just pretend like that's real and that's
what i did
tiny boop squig shorterly exactly
i ordered from dan giesling.shop and
mine arrived early yo that's i'm stoked
that's great news little life hack for
you
okay i don't know like you know what
let's just i don't want you to lose your
bone hearts
and this guy gets invincibility so let's
try it this way
how's bubbly going i'm glad you asked
delicious
i wish i had given up the hp from the
other character
no i stood still too long i was just i
was thinking i was just thinking
can you see what i'm doing man
oh geez
when do you eat lunch since you stream
from 10 to four
or 11 to four um i i
usually i'll try to eat lunch around
like 10 45.
um
that was a surprise uh
so at 10 45 this morning i had uh
i had chicken cashew curry really hits
the spot
one of my favorite morning meals we're
so dead like i mean
i i guess what i want to ask is like how
is a human being supposed to handle this
room
because it it seems absolutely
impossible
uh control q
control q he's done it control q
confirmed undefeated
yeah curse of the tower is good now by
the way
in case you missed the memo
i could i could gamble a little
i'm not making fun of ed at all i feel
like you know
ed should think that his the items he
made are good
he's you know he's like a proud papa but
i
am making fun of the people who
uh believed him
[Laughter]
okay hold on this room could change
everything ooh papa
okay hold up hold up this is big
uh scary man you must
purchase the spear at heart
the shop is kind of hard to navigate
with two characters
oh i bought the stars card accidentally
okay that's fine
um and then why don't you
also get pandora's box i got no idea
what the heck's
going on that's not how you do that okay
that's my mistake
here we go
let let the fun begin um okay
so it's ctrl control q
i want the nine volt on you which
doesn't even make sense but
um it's just q
just q yeah okay four spirit hearts
that's that's solid
oh i didn't want you to take that
okay saved member card has appeared in
the basement i guess because i bought
out like a whole shop
please place temperance down on the
ground
and then explode it
and then we're gonna hit control q
i don't know what's happening
q control q control space
control just q just q
control q okay you hit control q
blow yourself up accidentally
control q he's done it
okay um this is not
bad
ankh and d8 okay the d8 is not
what you're looking for as uh
when you're predominantly using bombs to
accomplish your task but
it could be worse like it's it's pretty
stunning to me that we're like
still alive it's so hard to dodge
oh what oh he can't fly anymore because
he has the bone heart i'm stupid
we still needed the hp but it's a very
tough run to win as
it's all so tough like i'm just being
honest on this one it's kind of tough to
maintain focus on these like insanely
long runs
part of the problem is i've you know
been streaming and talking as well but
whoops
and glancing and reading
and etc etc but
okay you don't have to dodge the red
bullets that's good to know that's good
to know
have you ever noticed that every
streamer and i don't just mean me when i
say this for once
have you noticed that every streamer
says everything twice
matter who i watch they repeat what they
said
two times i think every streamer on this
platform
myself included has been getting away
with
half banter for years just padding the
content
i only recently noticed this
diluted banter yeah man it's like a dupe
banter
if you if you want to ruin every
streamer's
uh mental health which i don't support
you doing this by the way but
just start pointing out how often
streamers say things two times in a row
you'll probably just get banned 24 hours
permanent but
because i i don't think they're gonna
take it nicely mausoleum too
just be like yeah you already said that
control q
q control space
i'm okay with this i know you're gonna
say like the emperor play
i really just wanted to get like a
possible deal with the devil
it won't happen anyway because we're
about to the whole freaking floor is
about to be swallowed up by bombs but
just run again i'm just like i'm just
asking questions here is a human being
supposed to be able to
realistically like
do anything on these rooms
[Laughter]
it's impossible man oh you you just
gotta tank them i think it's your only
hope
why not right
okay we're still alive
mausoleum is just insane dude
no i refuse to let you say curse of the
tower saved us
that's that's you've
you've twisted the narrative
it did the damage output is crazy
unfortunately about 20 percent of the
damage was directed towards us
q control space
control q done
easy mode
the muscle memory i'm sure it's going to
become second nature at some point
for now it's still it's still a little
rough like trying to use these items
you're not right it's like rocket
science
you trying to use a consumable it's like
liam neeson when he calls
the the kidnapper in taking one
good luck good luck good luck good good
luck
good luck good luck good luck
what are you talking about you haven't
seen taken one
it you don't have to see it's not very
good but
when he he does that famous phone call i
don't have money
what i do have a very particular set of
skills
skills that would make me quite annoying
for a man like you and then um
the the guy on the other end just like
laughs at him and says good luck
and then liam neeson goes on a travel
montage where he's like you know
traveling to
southeastern europe and just the echo of
that man saying
good luck just keeps playing over and
over in his head
it's quality filmmaking
you've unlocked double baby he's done it
yeah then he says tough times never last
only tough people last
for example so to speak
we got ourselves a double baby
starting to look like it might even be a
triple baby
could you repeat that uh tough times
never last only tough people asked
what's the best i can do
just thank you thank you
you already said that oh crap it got me
i i can't believe i invented like
anti-streamer technology
over the course of the stream like way
back in the day
i i came up with anti-streamer tech it
was going into a streamer's stream
and then just typing in chat is this
sponsored it was the easiest way to
annoy streamers of all time
it took over the site like uh like the
gray goo hypothesis of nanotechnol
nanotechnological armageddon uh
excuse me a semiconductor gotta gotta
damarang
um i vowed never to use my power for for
evil ever again
and here i go saying uh
you know start start telling streamers
they already said that and and watch the
fireworks
control space
think fast
you you can't hurt me with control space
you can't hurt me with is this a
sponsored stream because i'm the only
person with an
uh with the antidote the antidote is
saying i wish
if you say i wish then you're uh you've
neutralized it
but many people don't know about this
power
okay we like the swap here
empress card that's fine
that don't you have to dodge those you
don't have to dodge those
i gotta remember you don't have to dodge
those
why would saying is this sponsored
bother people back in the day
um sponsored deals for influencers were
very few and far between
so a lot of streamers like to think that
the fact that they were never getting
offered them
meant that they had some ethical
superiority over
people that um did get offered them
and as a result calling their integrity
into question with no evidence
whatsoever you know who would have
thought it kind of bothered them
it bothered me that's why i came up with
it in the first place
and it's why i vowed to not uh
to not use my power for evil ever again
now sponsored deals are are so regular
they're so normal
that you can just be like i wish and i'm
telling you that i wish is a perfect
anecdote
you already said that yeah it's a vod
dummy
back on top okay this room cannot be
completed by i'm just dead i
there's no escape for me i will just
continually be sucked into the portals
for the rest of my days
that room cannot be defeated as those
characters
there is no hope
oh son of a
yeah the mods have been doing a great
job we love the mods
the only time i've been mad at the mods
is when toasty
almost he said we should play an april
fool's day prank in the discord today
that made me think long and hard about
the types of characters i've been
associating with but
we got it sorted out no harm no foul
hold on okay we're gonna pop algaes
immediately
that's going to be control space we're
going to control space when we enter the
room
then we're going to control q yeah yeah
yeah yeah he's so good
now just get just chill just chill man
you're doing great
never take damage ever again thank you
glitter bombs
i think we're gonna win this run and i
the the thing is when we win this run is
gonna be very complicated for me because
i'm also like
gonna have to remember that somehow
i have to win like against the the final
boss
as this character which seems not
possible
now if don't don't try to april fools me
mouth comes into chat he says lol ed
said next patch is gonna nerf more items
look you really expect me to believe
you're you're following the isaac patch
notes
come on man
be reasonable
the hanging man
not memes i think it's memes i think
mal's the kind of guy
who would say not memes and then be like
gotcha
he'll he'll win by any means necessary
all right so let's get insanely weird
here
i'm gonna pick up all items
as jacob and then i am going to
re-roll and see what my shots look like
hard to tell and the stat screen is
indecipherable
[Laughter]
let's re-roll all of our stats
we have book of virtue that's
interesting
i think you might have ruined the run
nl's been real quiet since new zane
dropped
oh papa tough times never last
only tough people last
[Applause]
yes sir can i get a bacon egg and cheese
salt and pepper ketchup mayo on a roll
yes sir you already know the vibes
forget the bev you know i gotta cop to
arie yes sir
he's gone mad this is what like hours
and hours of streaming the same game
will do to
a an individual like mouth i don't know
how you did it with that craft man
i already did this bit uh simpsons did
it
remember that i'm ready for more dad
craft
yeah you and the guy in my chat who
keeps taking like passive aggressive
shots of me
for saying that i dreamed that i was
friends with a minecraft youtuber and
they said oh did you quit their server
in two days as well
so so needlessly hostile
to be honest you have to have a very
high iq to understand the simpsons
to be honest you have to have a very
high iq to understand the simpsons
you already said that oh okay sorry
we're just we're
just spitballing right now i'm just
waiting till my next re-roll so pick
this up because it's not good and then
we'll re-roll it
mouth who are the jets
getting at the trade deadline
are they gonna are they going all in are
they going yolo
okay this actually seems good
we got soy milk death's touch
people want savard or ekholm
i need to watch um
more hockey than just canucks games i
don't know who either of those
individuals are
hold on hold on
hold on hold on
question mark
control space he's done it
teardrop charm
i don't know if this is good but we're
still going
double last i'm seeing double four lusts
four lusties
to be honest you have to have a high iq
to understand the simpsons
i did see like i was wondering why the
canucks had not played in so long like i
hadn't really been following the
the team because they hadn't been doing
a great job lately and
i considered it a waste of my time to
watch the games
i guess they uh had like a week off and
then
also got covered so like you know if the
season wasn't already a little uh
busted i yes it got
got even more busted
kate please come and reboot your husband
yeah i need a
firmware update please kate
uh spacebar thank you
please just let me fight the boss i mean
you know what it is i'm actually like i
can maintain the illusion of coherence
for like
40 minutes when an isaac run is like i
mean this one's 42 minutes long but the
clock lies to you we've probably been on
it for like
60 minutes like that's where i lose my
mind
this is where i lose my mind
jacob's ladder seems pretty good it's
going to be a shame to reroll it
what percentage of comments do you read
i mean the honest answer is probably
like
i bet it's like 20 straight up
which seems i don't know i don't maybe
it seems low to you it seems pretty high
to me
it's not that hard to read so many
comments though because like you really
pick up the vibe of them pretty quick
like every once in a while you start
reading the comment and you're like this
is gonna be a funny joke that i can
steal
um but the rest of the time it's ooh
papa uh yes sir etc etc you already know
the vibe
you already said that you forgot a
single penny
14 rooms ago once you kind of get all
the genre
you can fill in the blanks for yourself
after you uh
after you've read them after you've read
like the first word
am i correct by the way somebody told me
that uh
and somebody was invicta that ma of the
void no longer gives a damage upgrade
and also
no longer generates uh
demon hearts rude
honestly just quite rude
yes sir got me
well i i hope
we can maybe put the uh
the lost in the corner because i i
really don't
see myself being able to dodge
i'm gonna give you the piercing shots
honestly
but if you just oh you know we don't
want to have you at the forefront
we want to have you at the back front
content is enjoyable poggy
we got the seal of approval the chat the
chat champion has spoken
i can't even see the other character man
what happened is that my peeper's eye
he was eaten by the larger baby oh you
mean draw scalar
we were on a break
jerry rachel's uh rachel
all right um somehow he's done it
i we've unlocked birthright i don't
understand
how it happened but but it has come to
pass we gotta win
we're three hours into the stream this
is my second slash



well the the rumors of my death have
been greatly exaggerated
we're gonna try the bloody mary
challenge again which is like
insanely difficult but that's what's fun
so for anybody that didn't see yesterday
we did unlock a few more by the way but
um the bloody mary challenge
every floor uh that you play
except for the first floor you go down a
half of a heart upon your uh
your entry to it now i gotta tell ya
do you think it's possible that sack
alter
will sack the knife and we'll be safe
nope unfortunately no
that would have been sick though
so i think i'll keep this because you
never know there's a lot of familiars in
this game that i wouldn't mind turning
into devil deal items
i think you've gotta have like a pretty
special run
in order to win this challenge so i
think you you take like low percentage
high reward plays i think you worry
about that more than like oh you could
have improved your run slightly by doing
this this or this
there's an omega tinted rock where
am i being trolled right now trollin
is it because this looks like a super
tinted rock
that's that's funny
[Laughter]
i saw it and it's real in the corner
room chad it's april fool's day
you wouldn't try to try to
engage in a ruse against me on april
fool's day would you plus it's
afternoon unless you live in like
old zealand like
i don't think you can continue to
legally do those uh
those kinds of pranks
if there is a super tinted rock i'll
take it either way
i swear it's not a troll
america people need to know whether or
not their president is a troll
i am not a troll where oh it's so
it's so freaking sneaky man
yo that was huge it's incredible
look at that small rock a very useful
item
that now that's top tier backseating
stand up chad take a bow
chatty chatty wasn't there
it seems they do not care chad he was
it's austin powers
i'm sorry it's austin powers again yeah
oh
no i won't say thank you to chad it was
just one guy
got him
24-hour vip permanent
i'm i'm hopeful and this is like you
know like delusion
uh it's the first phase of grief
bargaining
now i'm like okay sac alter does not
work
with uh like removing the blood rights
here
or the whatever this item is called
however
maybe if i take the orbital and then i
use it
it will work and take
both you know
well we're gonna lose all of our hp
anyway i thought it was worth a shot
losing an orbital sucks but we can't use
the orbital aggressively anyway so
you might as well suck up book of belial
i don't really want to suck up anarchist
cookbook
it's a little too hot
we can at least use it for bookable isle
i have no idea what's going on but i'm
here for it that's what's going on right
there
at the start oh look would you look at
that at the start of every room
or every floor things get uh things get
nasty man
you do get a stat boost proportion of
the hp lost
that is that's you already know the vibe
yes sir i think this is one where you
just gotta accept
that like you know you're in it
until you get the perfect run some of
the challenges are like that
you know you can't expect to win an
isaac run you know
every single time especially if you've
built the habit of just jumping in and
pressing r
until you get a game-winning item it
doesn't work like that you know the game
can smell the desperation
sometimes you gotta you gotta put a
little elbow grease into it all right so
this is obviously incredible
um
we should suck them up but i'm i'm i
want to
if possible get um
bookworm first
we've touched one book before
spirit hearts kind of suck for us right
now so i think we actually touch book of
sin
oh we touched two oh cause we touch
anarchist cookbook
you're absolutely right and then suck
them all up
beautiful uh and i gotta tell ya we
might as well hold the pill
uh and take it
how you guys doing doing okay out there
it's a really really really great
uh void play i'm being completely
sincere
uh because of the fact that now we have
some invincibility
so if i think the way we should start to
think about this challenge is
like instead of using void to suck up
bad items
like we can use void uh to
keep us protected on a tough room
while we uh while we wait for more red
hearts
not to mention it also gives you book of
sin which could pay out with the heart
when you use it
how about that and yeah i'm not uh i'm
not that into the tinted rock play uh
right now because we already got small
rock
so i think the only i mean it charges
void which is not bad actually but
it's it's not as good as the average
tinted rock but
do you think invincibility will block
the uh
will block the the damage i really doubt
but i really doubt that'll work i should
say but
if it works then we're like i mean we
win i think
it does no way come on it's april fools
you're taking me for an april fool
anyway i don't think we're gonna have a
charge anyway but we'll see
it blocks but it doesn't give you the
buff
fair trade
all right lots of hp that we don't
really care for
speed upgrade nothing wrong with that
take these
so bloody lust is like a synergy but
life's not all about synergies man
i think i think we're much happier to
just have some extra
uh survivability
now this next part is going to make it
seem like i'm uh
i'm a coward but these these are the
right choices man
you got to be careful like who's who's
giving you this advice online
there's a void charge you know you might
think that the person giving you advice
is like an isaac pro
because their name is uh hello this is
the realest invicta and so viktor
spelled wrong
sometimes you you might be uh
they might be someone who's actually
only got like 600 hours in the game
and is thus not good
you want to take advice from somebody
you take advice from me now that being
said i should not have continued playing
the self-sacrifice room
i forgot we can protect ourselves now
right
mash the mash strategies work okay
next step is coast
take your foot off the gas and just
freaking chill out man
just chill out get some red hearts back
you know it should only take a few rooms
and then put on the put on the slow jazz
we don't need andrew wk anymore we don't
need our gym pump up songs
we just need uh a little shoddy
don't you know it's a smoothie
beats to lower your heart rate too
these guys are faster now don't turn
this way
i think this only goes to regular satan
so i'm i'm
i'm somewhat optimistic to be honest
with you i'm feeling pretty good right
now
no i know you don't get the stat bonus
but like
are you is are people under the
impression that this run is difficult
because
uh you don't have enough stats or are
you under the impression it's difficult
because every single floor
your hp is reduced to the point where
you die in a single hit
like i i'm
i'm somewhat optimistic it's a lot
easier for us to
you know find stats than it is to
never ever get hit but it's it's close
it's like 50
50. why not take the stat
increases on easy floors like the cavern
let me really riddle you this okay
if the floor is so easy why do you need
the step bonus
i'd rather have the safety than the stat
bonus if the floor is as easy as you've
suggested
uh and i i rest my case and i pass the i
pass the court onto the uh defendant
because the stat bonus will help you on
the harder floors the stab bonus
disappears on the next floor right
it's a it's a temporary bonus
it does it stays oh that's okay you got
a good point then
i mean you can still die in a hit on the
caverns after being like you know i'm
built different if it's permanent though
that's sick
all right i can see the value in that i
still
am not going to do it
[Laughter]
what the oh right because we have
satanic bible
okay i don't even know like how this
will work now so i'm trying to walk it
through
it's not permanent april fools so i'm
like
i think if i pick up abaddon
i'm only gonna get demon hearts
but then i don't if i use invincibility
i don't know man let's do it it'll be
funny
you can't get demon hearts because i'm
bethany all right
now you got me on that one
that was an unwise play
we need red hearts immediately
just give it a sec i don't think we're
toasted yet
you grab this and this
and never get hit
next floor because of he's a genius
hold on hold on hold on yeah yeah take
this
there's options wait a minute okay you
know what let's get insane
the battery in the shop is the battery
uh pack it gives you
like three little batteries okay now we
have epic fetus with some double drops
michael dublay um we might as well take
our stats now i think
well no i don't know now that i think
about it maybe that doesn't make sense
okay hold on
this would be the ultimate challenge if
we succeeded here we're we're
desperately uh searching for magic mush
and money to play this judgment because
if the judgment gives us hp
then we're laughing again just like we
were last time
go out on your own terms i'm gonna go
out on my own terms
freaking on on my shield or whatever
what is what does he say
uh with with your shield or on it where
i choose uh with it
i choose with it that's what we're gonna
do
just everyone just chill out for for two
freaking seconds
we're just thinking it through love the
isaac
jay i screwed myself i'm on this is the
bloody mary challenge
i took abaddon thinking like oh i'm
gonna be so
i'm the smartest man in the world then
it turns out i'm
freaking not the smartest man in the
world i'm actually an idiot because you
can't get the demon hearts from abaddon
but it did give us so many charges on
our our incredible void
dude hold on
we still got 13 charges so we can
definitely do this once more
we even got another red heart also
somehow oh that's monster man well
that's not that exciting
come on you you loser you nerd
you peace
i'm just just studying it i know we got
one more but just
okay i guess we'll be using it
hold on hold on we're not done yet i'm
not owned
an attempt was made if he could just hit
that awas over here then i could escape
without having to use it
i really didn't want to have to do this
but
just go hard on this one two of diamonds
son of a
okay going offline guys
okay we hold on we could buy a battery
charge for the next floor
i'd rather buy the battery pack if i can
i mean we're going down a half a red
heart anyway like i'm okay with that
please come on
oh god come on man come on
hanged man something's wrong
i'm gonna go looking for the second
secret room
demon judgments now only drop spiders if
you blow them up
that's good the streamers have had it
too good i in my opinion
constantly uh constantly winning runs
by uh by blowing up demon judgments
it's nice to see them put back in their
place
okay second secret room please doesn't
exist there's no second secret rooms on
this one
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait
wait
bottom left of the secret room okay
you're absolutely right
here we go
what do we got lots of pills this could
be big hp up
and we got a natural charge and we got a
little closer on that one
we're back we're back in the casino
that's fine whatever luck doesn't do
anything anyway right are you a wizard
classic i can see forever just in time
luck up
owns get owns okay that was a good one a
very solid room
very solid room for us there we'll we'll
take the shortcut back
i mean with with a battery charge we
obviously like have to come back this
way
and uh do this
we got the razor blade after all that
you had the audacity to give me the
razor blade
really makes you think we do have two of
diamonds
so we'll pop the head right away
awas i personally guarantee
like we could use it to skip a floor but
that's not how you play this game
you use it to get a crawl space and the
crawl space
gives you bff we are rolling now
we we just won probably just won the
game right there
now we have an orbital so how are they
gonna hit me if i have an orbital i
don't see it happening
we'll take this so we don't immediately
die
on the next floor hopefully and uh yeah
doubters i'm going to give the doubters
a chance to cover their short right here
you know if you if you want to pay back
uh 1.25 times your original bet now's
the time
you might as well hit me i'm not going
to stop you oh you don't even do me the
service
now we just wait as long as possible to
use
this book of sin
i mean we got to try to play the
judgment of the blood bank dude
with book of sin we gotta we gotta try
we we can wait till we get a little
further
ahead on this floor because now we're
actually looking semi-stable
like a like a cream cheese
i mean you're gonna laugh because this
is truly asinine
my personal prediction
if we make it to the boss we win this
run
the odds of us getting an item we need
are insanely high
all we need is hp
we have epic fetus we have the ability
to protect ourselves
every single floor
from the the negative effects of the
challenge
i think i think the abaddon play is
going to go down in history as one of
the smartest plays in isaac history
you also have satanic bible yeah but we
can't get demon hearts it it charges up
uh
it gives us a little uh a little refund
on our active charge
okay this is for all the marbles
this changes everything a double hit
please
don't even need it don't even need it
why not right okay i'm just trying to
think what the heck we even
suck it all up man you could suck it all
up
but before we do that
[Laughter]
probably got no keys you're absolutely
right
what this challenge is supposed to be
hard
[Laughter]
take the halo oh no i accidentally got
every stat
item ever invented twice
i don't even know what's happening man
i'm freaking
i'm i'm just going off now
we don't the funniest part of that is we
do not need stats
at all all we need is hp
so let's get it
this man makes no sense i
i couldn't agree more quite frankly
i couldn't agree more
but like um how do we lose now the only
way that i
foresee a reasonable
a reasonable loss happening here is uh
not having a battery charge when we go
down to the next floor we got enough
rooms left to charge it right now so
that's not a big deal
you see lust even stutter stepped for a
second
whatever who cares
lust was like i don't know if i want to
like bring this kind of
evil on to my life today and then they
decided well you know it's what i'm
programmed to do
i might even take the health down
just to feel something
well i i personally guarantee you will
never see this challenge done in this
exact fashion
he skipped the halo he's not going for
those coins excuse me
i didn't skip the halo alright i sucked
up five items
rather than taking the halo
there's a difference sweetie
okay we gotta play the blood bank that's
that's a given
we did get the prayer card out of that i
don't know what happened to the
to the eternal heart from the prayer
card but
gaming i almost sucked it up that's one
step too far
if i had if i'd sucked up the halo that
would have been too far but you know
what
i agree yeah this is just like that
scene in lucy where she turns into
computers
i am no builder thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
thank you much appreciated now just
don't forget you you hit the space bar
here
can't be stopped double your keys
what the well i'm very glad we didn't
like screw up not having a charge that
would have been
truly devastating we would have died
i gotta admit you're you're a hard enemy
to to crack here
uh bug report a little pin
cannot be killed with epic fetus
i'd like to submit a bug report
little pin is the most powerful
uh enemy in the game that is probably oh
son of a i'm gonna guess not working as
intended
uh they are immune to epic fetus
they can't be killed simply can't be
killed
it's not possible
oh my god uh red hearts let's go we we
die
we live i've been back to hell and back
and
back to hell i'm back to hell i'm back
mimics excuse me
since when
that's lying from dota yes yes sir
i'm going to be honest with you why
wouldn't we
like i think at this point we'd have to
be stupid not to
maybe it'll reroll the curse
nope oh and we still have epic
fetus
please don't make me fight
the
don't make me fight the the little pin
man i can't do it
help down i should have known i guess
next charge it works v4 doesn't work on
first charge
who made this
what were they thinking
saved well okay
confirmed it definitely does work
[Laughter]
okay okay now we're doing the challenge
for real
f i i can't disagree believers have been
real quiet since this video came out
but if that's what it takes to get
through little pin
then that's what it takes he should be
dead he he
he tried to dock in a section of the map
with no
uh with no terrain he should have
fall died to fall damage
hanged man okay now we're talking
why does he put so much sauce on it man
the hanged man
no don't you stay i'll go to you i'll go
to you you stay
um saved we gotta reroll this whole run
man
scary
[Laughter]
yeah yeah i knew i was going to lose the
books that's why i did it
sometimes you got to destroy the sacred
texts
because you know j.j abrams is just
going to write him back in anyway
you know i deserve that one
plus none of the books were um one up on
wall street by peter lynch so they're
probably just
not even worth the paper they're printed
on
got him got him got him please thank you
okay let's get one more charge
you know i would read one up on wall
street by david lynch that that would
it would be an interesting perspective
that's for sure
we should go to the shop first going to
the shop nl go to the shop
2021 challenge
i don't want to reroll just yet i'm not
i'm not ready for it
it's it's a little too risky for my
blood
first you gotta you gotta feel what it's
like to have no power
so that you know what to do when you
have power
i mean you gotta take the coupon
then you use it
then you
buy this so that it must make one of the
other two items get
free when we suck it up
it doesn't work on the first pass
whatever
still got don't care didn't ask plus we
still got a tears upgrade
but we could do it again
and then get one of these
dr fetus is that's a strong item
no question about that
i really wanted the compass but i'll
settle for this we also just got to nine
lives
which actually means the challenge might
be doable again
let's go
you know you don't even wanna know what
i was gonna say i was gonna say where
did
where did dr fetus go
it's quite simple just don't get hit go
to item room they
simply do not exist on these challenges
the item room does not exist uh
on the bloody mary challenge because
they're worried it's already like so
easy
that they don't want to give you item
rooms and have you just like steamroll
it obviously
i don't know what you're doing okay you
stand in the middle
sure okay like of course yes why
wouldn't i all right let's do it
apparently satanic bible was involved at
some point on this floor
um all right down to the next floor
i don't know what's happening uh you
know you know you're absolutely right i
should have gone for the health down
pills that were back there
i remember this item is something to do
with tears
when you're when you're right you're
right man having nine lives is insanely
good
but i did hear um through the grapevine
that um
you might lose your lives on a
transformation now
so we we got to be mighty cautious with
that
that's my bed
but what if we just used eight of them
instead right here and then re-rolled
genius yeah we could just go to the
self-sacrifice room use
nine lives and then my god
you also lose your transformations
okay good to know good to know
i am having some fun though i mean this
this is my kind of run you know
how would i describe my my isaac energy
in a nutshell um
this i want i was gonna bomb myself in
there anyway honestly just to get out
safely
uh i would describe my isaac energy
as making uh a mistake and then refusing
to acknowledge it as a mistake and just
like quintupling down
uh and and this run has really allowed
that to work in a big way
so i respect it
if you never sell you can't lose uh
pride exactly
exactly
pot play outstanding outstanding move
abaddon play probably is one of the
smartest moves i've ever made like if
you can't understand it
like to to the the lay mind the mind of
the lay person
genius and idiocy are indistinguishable
so
you know if anything i didn't realize
how many people i had to be sympathetic
to
yeah sure let's like let's suck this up
that makes sense all right
um yeah why not i don't know
let's grab this for a second and then
just do that
how we doing here we got an eternal
heart just chilling
we do have nod leaf now
we have missing though
oh we dude new spider mod just dropped
how about that
but we can't use missing though because
if we use missing no we lose
void which we don't want that's too much
i know we lost our lives again this was
the same i i don't want anyone to ever
be able to say
nl took the easy way out on this
challenge by having book of shadows
i want you to i want you to have to be
forced to recognize
that i did it my way
the man simply cannot be stopped
we we got an hp upgrade oh because we
rerolled our whole run into mom's knife
dude
little battery charges down there you
little sickos your
freaky little sexy sickos i'm excited
okay
that's not so good but that's fine roll
it again
i did say i don't want anybody to say i
didn't take the easy way out
missing no stayed i think i'm gonna kill
the boss and then re-roll um there's a
troll bomb
wait a minute can i see what greed's eye
i can see what's in the chest
man
or guppy's eye guppy's eye
how about that oh they're excited
mom me
i'm hoping our reroll here will re-roll
the missing no
but i can't say for certain if that's
the case
it did not well this should be
[Laughter]
interesting
it's simple we just live
that's tough that's tough this is an
impossible room
can't be can't be beaten
i'm not super thrilled to have uh
bbf just flying out there they're trying
to get me killed
we do still have the void you're not
wrong
i love this song
we are the world okay that scared me
what what if what a chat what if what if
just kidding i wouldn't but what dude
what if we popped hangman and went in
there
whoa
you know it had to happen at some point
let's start again that was fun though i
had a good time
the abaddon play
all right if you're just watching we're
on the bloody mary challenge
and we just lost but it was honestly
like one of the best
wins of my career i had i had a great
time
meanwhile ten thousand people sorry
thirteen thousand one hundred people
begging me to stop having fun and
instead just like
please just complete the challenge
so that you can unlock a penny that when
you pick it up gives you the curse of
darkness
and i looked them in the eyes and i said
no because you know what we're all about
having fun here we're all about the
vibes
and if i could do it again i'm going to
do it again man
hold on that run was slash marker
next bloody man



could we all i ask on this one is could
we at least
get the
confirmed dictionary definition
of uh whether or not it's possible to
get a permanent upgrade from the stats
we get here
from from whatever this awful item is
called the upside down t
is damn we call it because it's a right
side up t
it's not permanent stats are you telling
me that in the last episode somebody
lied
in we had them swear
on the lad bible and they still lied to
us
that's perjury 24-hour stats
permanent
how dare them that's what i'm saying man
that's what i'm saying okay so i'm just
trying to think about how we're gonna do
this
i like an orbital an orbital's good i
think a
sensible approach for us here is um
don't use our shubatabu plays until we
know
we're going to uh
have half a heart you know so like don't
use them here on this boss i can dodge
this boss i
24 hour stream of dodging this guy
actually no problem
no place to leverage those so we'll save
our shoops
for this floor because now we're going
to be on low hp
having these shoops is uh more
advantageous all right that's a nice
library
it's charges but you know what if we
could if we could get an item that
changes characters
the hero font would be more valuable as
spirit hearts if it worked that way
hmm so this is like it charges
itself that's not that good
um we did get bookworm
so there's something what if you what if
you blow this guy up man
yeah the clicker might actually be a
pretty solid item right now
though i hate to say it
it's true don't you know just find one
specific item
forehead but you know it's been known to
happen like remember last time we
we had the one com we had the run
completely one until
you know some idiot was like hey take
abaddon
it'll be funny
and if i ever figure out who that guy is
he's
okay you're fast now huh he's 24-hour
band permanent
is what i was gonna say
wasn't it you you better hope not
otherwise i'm out of here
um well we might as well go to the curse
room we lose permanent stats but
some permanent stance although they're
not permanent stats although their
permanent stance nobody knows yet
the jury's still out
ban yourself sit yourself 24 hours sit
ban yourself new new hob just dropped
okay let's see we had 6.28 on this floor
we lost stats when we went down to the
next floor and gained them again
so it's definitely not permanent okay
satanic bible will give us a deal with
the devil
telepathy for dummies necronomicon
i still like shoop the whoop here do we
want a deal with the devil instead of a
regular deal no
yes it's tough
it's a tough decision i think for one
floor yes
for one floor we want it but we're gonna
take shoop with us
good shoot good shoot we got 15 spirit
hearts
burning a hole in our pocket
earning natural charges dude honestly i
think this is easy
i don't know why everyone's so convinced
this is a hard challenge
i'm starting to believe it might be one
of the easiest challenges ever
added to the game well that's not true
because scat man was like
actually like okay ed cover your ears
scad man was so easy that it actually
almost put me to sleep um

as hard as as the normies would
have you believe let's put it that way
i can't get in there huh
you lost scat man yeah and you know
uh cleopatra died when she got bitten by
like a snake or whatever
as long as we're gonna keep talking
about things that are like you know in
ancient history
yeah that could have been bad um
yeah yeah yeah yeah
something something something and
there's something yeah
yeah yeah yeah you know this one's
sing-along if you know it

those and call me in the morning

i have the occult damage up and you can
control your tears
okay that song blows 24 hours
i'm sorry i'm losing it man
i'm losing it it is an endlessly great
quote though
you can use it for any purpose
any purpose related to mild anger at
least
you could count how many times you said
that this stream you can count anything
brother
24 hour man
permanent
just i don't know what it is it's such a
good quote
i'm so happy we had so many spirit
hearts that i can actually like live
this is a tough one still tough
this is one way to do it man
i don't want to use too many but like if
you're gonna use them now's the time
like
when when you're low on hp and then you
store them up when you're when you're
high on hp hopefully or high on podness
if you're mathis now i understand like i
watched dan's first
alt f4 stream and i was like where does
this man get the energy
now that i'm you know i've been playing

thank you thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
pog we're alive so
so eat with the delicious breakfast
treat
sanchez's okay sorry
what i meant to say we gotta elevate the
level of discourse here
you know everybody knows that general
custer died at the battle of
little bighorn what this book
presupposes is
maybe he didn't
i don't know how i feel about eye of a
cult here
i feel like if the shots didn't break uh
so quickly i'd be a lot happier
maybe we need piercing shots to to make
that happen
i mean like we could get a
we could get an absolutely amazing tears
upgrade
um
ah screw it hp's easy to come by
empty vessel's not the right play this
time though it's probably an eternal
heart in here
nine lives hey king you dropped this
thank you it's a crown for anybody not
looking it's a crown
goodbye i'm dead i'm alive
yeah empty vessel will kill us dead
there's no chance
unfortunately too spooky saved you i
don't
what is too spooky oh it scares enemies
who get close
okay well okay two spooky might have
saved me but i picked up two spooky so
who saved two
self save exactly i pulled myself up by
their bootstraps
your music saved me
i know i picked it up when when it was
um curse of the blind you know why
because i take a chance on him you take
a chance on me
we got curse of the blind pick up to
spooky
if you change your item we could get it
thank you
rat jam dude rainbow poop undefeated
no thank you no thank you okay 14 spirit
hearts in reserve
yeah abbott full stop does not get
enough respect
this run is now dedicated to abba
look at that as soon as we dedicated the
run to abba save the item
going down to the next floor still got
11's spirit hearts backing us up
i hate abba how can you hate abbott
oh frick i forgot about that how can you
hate abba man
overrated everybody in north america
freaking hates abba dude tell me you're
from sweden without telling me you're
from sweden
that's not true mamma mia was pretty
popular huh
no no
he lived
things got mighty dangerous there
yeah abba's sick man waterloo great song
winner takes it all
winner takes it all is such a good song
vince gilligan used it in better call
saul
mamma mia and dancing queen i don't you
know i don't vouch for those but
like the ones where they actually tried
to make a good song they often succeeded
you can't be hit simply cannot be hit
come off it man abba's awesome
why you why are you singing songs like
abba bro
oh sorry sorry
i don't know head over heels by abba i
only know the
the tears for fears one which is a heavy
pog energy for sure
as soon as ever
and talk about the weather get the tears
up in the theme and then we'll go in the
room
bgs are better than abba so like here's
the thing
they can co-exist but also
bg's also heavily underrated
everybody just because uh
you know staying alive is like so
unbelievably
popular at least was in the 70s like
they think that the bg's are like a one
note disco
uh you know like joke but first off
disco is kind of cool
you know people will be out here like
insulting disco but then be like oh
check out this new lcd sound system
album
yeah what do you think james murphy is
dude he's just sad disco
it's true and he should say it
but the bg's underrated like staying
alive i think it's a good song but like
you've
heard it a lot for sure um but
all the other songs off of the what the
heck is this
off of the saturday night fever
soundtrack are so good you know what
let's stop this problem in its tracks
the one where he goes i gotta shove it
up
and i should be dancing that's like
it's honestly that came out in like 2019
they would be like a hundred gaks they
would be beloved by the
by the populace
how deep is your love it's a great dude
wonderful song
how do they sing so well
i i don't it's it's not fair man because
i'm
living in a world of park
holding me down when they should
be pogging up yeah i don't know how they
do it like
you know what they just build them
different in australia i guess
love the gaks i don't even know where i
am on this run to be honest with you
i'm i'm inclined to believe that
actually i've come to terms with the
fact that this item
uh where we control our tears is
actually horrible
i think it's it's a negative i wish it
had not
shown up
insubordinate and churlish you know what
a card matters
it seems like it needs a bit more
practice i agree it seems like it could
go back to the practice room and
practice not being bad
uh so that it's worth having on this run
but shoop the whoop they broke the mold
when they built that one
that that item is killing it man no but
on the other hand okay hold on hold on
what do you got for me
the idea of taking a forget me now here
is actually hilarious
because it does get us out of the boss
room but it gets us
out of the boss room at the cost of
shupita whoop and it gives us nothing
like it gives us access to one more shop
and a mom
fight like it's a guaranteed badness
it's not good i wish it were but it's
it's literally
it's a throw with no entertainment value
i thought i could blow it up imagine the
pog though you don't use my own words
against me
i really need your pog
oh we came so close to the edge
okay i'm gonna get the half heart don't
sweat it
love it love it now we're talking
are you about to break you know what i
realized
i thought that in rock music linkin park
invented using record scratch in their
songs
and then i was listening to the lonesome
crowded west and i realized that modest
mouse did it back in 1997
on the on the song hart cook's brain i
feel like
uh my my whole life up to this point had
been a lie
they got a lot of parts in that song
they go like
it do that a lot it's it it's really
opened my eyes man
modest mouse might be the first new
metal band on the planet
modest mouse confirmed first they're
innovators
that's new metal baby
does rage against the machine count uh
yeah i forgot about them
that's a good point
they've been around for a while why am i
still taking these pills man
nobody knows and yet here i am
herbie hancock did uh scratching before
yeah but herbie hancock also loves to
lie
although i will say i do love
that herbie hancock song that goes dirty
yeah rocket that's what it's called
okay i'm almost out of
superfluous charges this is not good
i thought at some point the run would be
mathematically forced to scale
and that appears to be incorrect so i
think
i'm realizing we're probably dead
you mean throwing man we got no items
got probably got no games either this
excel it is okay we can live we just got
to play out of our minds
is i've been saving the pog energy
it's very simple next floor is shoal
which is the final floor
we're not in danger immediately on shoal
because of the fact that we have
the justice card we can use our justice
card
to give us some hp
please sir may i have a crumb of bets
curse room dare i no i shan't
on the other hand i must
there is zack snyder's justice card
this card might be 4x3 for all i know
what's your favorite part of any modest
mouse song
i like the modest mouse songs that sound
like isaac brock like phoned in the
lyrics from a pay phone
in eastern washington state
the ends lull good one
24 sorry permanent
he does say well a lot well
he might say that is that and these are
these i'll tell you what you get you get
away from me
or he might say cowboy dan was a major
player in the cowboys scene
he says that all the time
he does also say well it's the big show
how's that by the way is that is that
show good
the show where uh
big show is a dad
is it a good one i got here what's the
actual win rate
depends do you mean how many runs have
we won or how many times has
have you been a winner for being here
we've had some big wins today honestly
in both terms but also in game terms um
we've had some heavy heavy losses as
well though
some some little freak in chat got me to
pick up uh
abaddon as bethany ruined my whole
freaking run dude i persevered as best
as i could probably better than anybody
could have
ever anybody else on earth could have
done but
it wasn't enough
we win we win the game double win
why take pills because i need to find a
health upgrade man
close knowing full health exists is nice
i'm dumb saved saved
mr reckonator thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
thank you i cannot glance at chat but i
appreciate the support
use justice how about you
give me good advice instead of bad
advice because we need this justice card
for the next floor
and now what are your thoughts on the
hipster subculture of
the early 2010s it was very annoying as
a man with early onset male pattern
baldness and bad eyes
that um i ended up being lumped in
as a as a super hipster just because i
was
like shaved bald and had thick glasses
everybody was like nice hipster look and
i'm just like i'm just broken man like
jeans are just
[__]
but i i do feel like um
the hipster it got easier for me
personally
when all the hipsters converted to um
having waxed mustaches
and man buns i think that made my life a
lot easier
nobody assumed that people just assumed
that i was bald for bald reasons you're
right i do have two justice cards thank
you
you were not wrong there
is wax stash still around
i think so there used to be a brewery i
would go to to get a growler phil
yo tell me you're from vancouver without
telling me you're from vancouver
yo ox can i get a uh
raspberry changeling 2-liter growler yes
sir
yeah give me some of that jerky too yes
sir
um and he always wore like a vest
and like one of those like news boy caps
and he had a waxed mustache
and i was like that's how i know i found
my place
the beer was was very good
and you already know the vibes
ah frick
let's do it man
mama it would be very nice
to not die here okay that hurts
but it had to be done better to
to do what needs to be done and live
then hold on to an item and die i mean
you just can't dodge mama gertie like
it's it's it's not dodgeable that hurts
he's a genius
well that's the item we've all been
waiting for
now we do have a charge
i don't want to use it yet if i can
avoid it
nine percent chance with the deal with
the devil
this would be mighty nice
yo new probability just dropped john
nash has been real
quiet since this nine percent chance
turned out to be nine lives in mom's
knife on the same deal with the devil
easy
sometimes you gotta focus
maybe we should fight uh uh
who's this enemy again i haven't seen
him in 10 years um
yeah can corn can of corn and i'll be
all right can a corn all right take me
down here
that's hush
oh i thought i could dodge it
this room is livable
don't glance there will be no glancing
tonight
we got a natural charge
i don't know what you do and i don't
want to find out
no
going offline guys
sorry



hey we're back playing some repentance
it's been going pretty well
we've actually done
admirably i would say we we've made it
further in
many more times than i would have
expected so early
you know it's still learning what the
enemies do do and all that but and and
readjusting the new shot speed but but
really doing a great job of uh
at least milling every single content
for
all the juice that they have including
the pulp
close to 50 50 in the polls that's how
you know
if you're watching on youtube you don't
know what's going on but there was a
poll about whether or not
we would win and we're stuck at 50 50.
this is a pretty hard game that that's a
higher than expected
percentage of believers
do you like pulping your orange juice um
here's the thing and you're gonna take
this as a bit of a flex
okay in fresh orange juice
i don't mind pulp in
like tropicana orange juice or like
orange juice
concentrate and stuff like that i don't
really like the juice to begin with
like and we've had this conversation
before and and people uh
they're very protective of their orange
juice
like fresh orange juice is like sweet
and also like a hundred dollars per
liter okay we just took that one right
in the face
nearsighted friend is better but not
that good still i'm gonna re-roll it um
yeah like fresh orange juice is like
sweet and delicious and then like all
the orange juice you can buy in the
supermarket
tastes like battery acid
look for another battery charge speaking
of which
like it has such a high degree of
divergence between
like excuse me like what
fresh juice tastes like and what
store-bought juice tastes like
it's not like i'm going out by the way
and buying fresh orange juice all the
time like
it's mighty expensive if i'm
like an orange julius or something like
that i might consider but
like the actual i i would go so far as
to say like
orange juice like the lobby for orange
juice
has really they've performed a psyop on
the rest of humanity
because it's simply not that good but
people have
have now come to the opinion that it's
like a health food or something and it's
you've absolutely got to have it for
breakfast otherwise i'm not going to get
enough vitamin c like i'm at such a high
risk of getting scurvy or something
okay ragman default stats not where we
want to be
what do you do you wait for him to
summon another head
that's fine i don't sweat that you wait
for him to summon the head
excuse me you heal off of that is that
new or it
is am i just bad um
someone head so i can place a bomb down
and look like a genius
thank you now we're talking
okay we have a key i don't even remember
what the heck a bar of soap does but
luckily it tells me
tell me your tears and shots speed up
with telling me your tears and shots
speed up
anyway i uh yeah i don't like orange
juice
at least store bought and if you're
buying
i love fresh orange juice we're going to
see if this is 48 hour energy
hematemesis could definitely be better
how about grapefruit juice i meant the
ice perhaps
somewhat surprisingly i'm a big fan of
grapefruit juice fresh is still better
but i think that goes for like just
about everything
um
just keep it moving here uh but i i like
a store-bought grapefruit juice from
time to time
i don't i don't have a a negative
connotation with some bitterness
and i enjoy bitter foods to some extent
no i'm not a savory juice guy i don't
like tomato juice either
matz clematto matz clematto's been real
quiet
since v8 splash came out
no i'm with you so somebody in chat just
said uh i may be considered a child but
apple juice with breakfast just hits
different
it's one of the like great weirdnesses
of like uh
standards that like if you like orange
juice you're an adult and if you like
apple juice you must be like six years
old
i'm like store-bought apple juice tastes
way better than store-bought orange
juice
to me at least
it's a good it's a good quencher i agree
yes i know i only drink tap water i mean
i i drink
i drink coffee for breakfast i like
literally like
97 of my beverage consumption is water
and then occasionally i'll have like a a
diet
soda if we got uh you know some takeout
or something like that
just keep it moving
what about bubbly yeah water
oh yeah my favorite alcoholic beverage
gin and chocolate milk
the way the the pine needles uh
really accentuate the the chocolateness
of the chocolate milk
okay well this is now doubters are
shaking
what go ahead take my battery charges
see if i care
no i'm a i'm like an ipa stout guy
they did i think tech x got a little
nerfed but it's still
like
still extremely good i will say though
like i don't know if anybody else here
lives in like
the west coast or maybe they've taken
over everywhere
it's starting to change like a couple of
years ago
basically like all you could get from
micro breweries were ipas
it's a little better now you can get
like
you know they're making a lot of sours
um
making a lot of like belgian wheat ales
and stuff like that but still like if
you go
to uh like a liquor store or a beer
store
here every brewery has like
nine ipas and even i'm like enough is
enough
you know like i get that that's what the
market's like here but
there's only like like five cool stouts
i i always enjoy like uh
uh storm black plague stout delicious
always enjoy a saint ambrose oatmeal
stout
but then like you know there's not that
many to go around man
at least up here
why am i i dodge and then i decide you
know what no i'd rather get hit
yeah man west coast is like in love with
ipas
a cbc journalist did like a a bracket
of the best beer in bc beers
best british columbia
uh i do like a speed upgrade
much more than i like a shot speed
upgrade but it is what it is
and uh the the
the beer that won the ipa bracket won
everything but it was also the beer that
i voted for
so what can i say
we need to save some bombs let's move on
this this run is a great chance here
no we don't get uh pliny the elder up
here or or plenty the young
younger for that matter you probably
could get it but it's like uh
you'd be paying import fees i don't even
know if you could get it now with covet
and everything but
lord palmerston they were they were bc
specific beers it's a beer called fat
tug
made by a uh a brewery on vancouver
island called driftwood
taking a lot of damage here
wait what it's humorous to you that it's
called fat tug
i couldn't possibly understand why
it is a great name like you wait
whenever
and this is uh wistful like pre-covered
days or like if you're
i guess vaccinated and loving life on
the patio right now rubbing it in for me
uh
please whatever it's still a good item
um i don't i don't take pleasure in this
for the record
but whenever they're like and what do
you have to drink i'm always like
can i get a 500 milliliter fat tug and i
always feel like i'm about to get
slapped in the face
and i i would deserve it quite frankly
that's yeah
can i please get 50 centiliters of fat
tug
can i get or you just point to it can i
get this beer
oh you want a big fat tug
it's in so many words man
okay now this is where you gotta use the
thinking you
stop stealing my charges dude i i mean
little
chub is not that good so
i think we re-roll and if we still see a
bad item we just take the random one
we have a beer here called buttcomb now
we're talking
i did see earlier today there there's a
a
famous english brewery called brewdog
it's they're not really a brewery so
much as like a corporation but
f they were like
scottish sorry scottish and they were
like
hey suggest some collaborations for
beers
no answer is like unappreciated and i
was like
you know what it you know be really cute
is if i snuck in there and said like
make a northern lion beer
and then there had already been like
a thousand influencers that had already
snuck into the dms and i was like oh
crap
too late
yogscast did it already oh man maybe
sips could get me in
hopefully it would at least uh
work better than the time he tried to
get into no pixels
[Laughter]
okay per throw is good per throw is good
we need to do news i'm dead i'm dying
i'm dead
i forgot literally like i forgot that
these guys could go
over the gaps in the ground
i thought i was a genius and and then i
realized i'm a fool but you know what
pay out the doubters
it's an incredible curse room it's still
good
i apologize to the believers things got
rough there
there's no story with no pixel like
literally i was like
sips got dan in and then i watched dan
play and i was like oh i need to get a
slice of this
so i said hey sips like i feel weird
asking because i know you already just
like leaned on your contact
to get dan in but could you get me in as
well and he's like yeah sure just add
this guy on discord
and it still is still pending
uh like six weeks later
[Laughter]
but even dan's not playing no pixel
anymore like i kind of
i mean i don't follow the streamer
trends that much but i do feel like
maybe
the i i miss the when the iron was hot
on no pixel and and maybe i'll just try
to get in
you know it's it's like cryptocurrency
you know i'll try to get in when things
are at a low
and then maybe like three years later
it'll come back and then i'll already be
in
yeah like chess exactly
how long do you think oh well first off
evp tom
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
how long do you think the the among us
legs would last
honestly i wouldn't even prognosticate
like
i sometimes i kiss a little bit on like
apollo stream or hafu
stream and i'm like among us viewers are
just built different
like the it's sisyphysian and they they
love it
so i mean a lot of kindred spirits maybe
with like isaac viewers right like
the game is the same just about every
time with like little variations and
then
they're they're like please feed me more
like one more please
kaidama yo thank you again evp
tom
plebs have been real quiet since evp tom
came out
okay hold on i gotta think about this
for a second
i it's on it and this is not like a
negative thing i know i make fun of
among us but like you know it's just a
different vibe
i just i find it like stressful to watch
i think it's the
the way that i now understand like
people who say that
uh the office is like oh i can't watch
it it makes me uncomfortable
it just makes me so angry watching it
i i i get stressed out man and i know
it's like kayfabe don't get me wrong but
i'm like it's just
again not being rude i'm not saying that
the streamers are
are this but i just find it an
unpleasant viewing experience because
they just
feel like bad
as i'm watching it i'm just like stop
shouting
can we calmly discuss the sus and and
non-suss levels here
can't we like adults just decide whether
the hard clear got sussed or unsussed
did he move into electrical i don't know
but with everybody
shouting i it's it's hard for me to use
my the logical centers of my brain
we need a key oh easy enough
we re-roll we re-roll this luck's good
maybe even luck is like more valuable
now
um i feel nutty
sorry phrasing
no i'm like i cuz now like some people
in chat are like yelling equals fun by
the way i'm like six years old and i'm
like oh come on man
it's not really the energy i was trying
to bring here is more like
uh
you know it's just uh it's not the
content for me i don't mind like mimi
conte i mean just in general here's the
thing you know i've talked about like a
couple of different
like uh spectrums on which i like
evaluate whether
content is right for me the more
streamers that are on the same stream
generally the more my enjoyment goes
down
i'm like a one to three streamer kind of
stream
guy at least now you know when i when
there's like a mega stream with like 10
people
i'm like often times i'm going to watch
uh somebody play like a little rainbow
six siege or something
if you gotta and i think that this is
where the among us lobbies have done a
great job
if you got streamers that are all in on
it they all got a great vibe and they
understand that like they can't be the
only ones talking
you got to give other people a chance to
talk then i think it can totally work
but all it takes is a couple of people
being like nah you don't get to say your
joke even though you haven't said a joke
for
20 minutes i get to say my joke and by
the way my joke is that's what she said
and then that's where i'm like sorry
guys i've got to go
um and leave here but
more power to you
okay i'm not sure about this almond milk
right now
what about oat milk yeah if they really
wanted to modernize the game they should
have replaced the almond milk with oat
milk
you hear this one
you hear this one kevin
now i understand what it's like to be an
only child that's true i was always
listened to
i can't deny that and i think it created
uh
unrealistic expectations for adulthood
i think there's some people that like if
they're not
you know it they're okay with having the
fight to get a word in edgewise
i'm very much the opposite like if i
have to fight to get a word in edgewise
i'm like screw you guys i'm gonna take
this gold and i'm gonna use it only for
my own
edification you know
you you had your chance to be in on the
jokes and we could have glorified each
other through them
now i'm using it uh exclusively for my
own benefit
and then i make a farting sound of the
mic
hold on bad
still pretty bad downpour one we might
as well just
use it because we got to keep the d6
rolling forward
okay we don't have a key this is a
rip-off man
i'll walk on some spikes if i have to i
don't have to i'm a genius
if you'll excuse me almonds
oats oats and almonds please i knew we
could sneak it in there it's just a
matter of time i must say your dodging
is the best it's been for years
like you gotta be so freaking
yolked just to have any chance to
survive in the current iteration of this
game
i love it oh we didn't get any bonus
bombs though
thanks for the gas up by the way i
appreciate it you always keep the curse
room in that situation
it's gonna fill you up and never let you
down
okay we we desperately need a tear
effect that's the next step
everything else is going pretty well now
like we we gotta
we got a pretty good setup for uh hp in
particular
but okay okay
that was damage i'll take it
no i i haven't had a chance actually to
watch mouth play uh at all
he's a little bit of an early boy by my
standards i'm usually still on baby duty
by the time uh
when he goes live it's
tears up do we really need a tears up at
this point this is an interesting
thought
because we're shooting 14 tiers a second
so don't get me wrong it's always nice
to have more but i
with a reroll machine i'm always like or
i'm almost i should say like maybe we
could just try to
try to mill something really good yeah
the knockback would be horrible
you're not wrong you know what
don't even think about it don't let chat
talk you out of it
all right we're gonna die this is
horrendous this is truly horrible
[Laughter]
but we did get a lot of consumables and
our damage got a lot better
okay but then remember all stats give
you
all stats
when the zane goes too far whatever we
can just get a reroll machine anyway
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no no
okay we got a mirrored dimension
we need to reroll that again as well
as long as we fight incredibly weak
enemies for the rest of the game and
they never get harder we got nothing to
worry about
come on man really really
i'm a little upset i got hit i i don't
think you know we we got to hold
ourselves to a higher standard than
getting hit against this guy
it would be nice if the lighting sorry
okay i'm getting too salty because what
i was going to say is it would be nice
if the lighting allowed you to see the
corners of the room
but
[Laughter]
what i meant is with all of my power
i accidentally made a mistake and
couldn't see that the corner of the room
was
uh not walkable
it was a little close for comfort this
is an old-school isaac boss though
literally like just walk around in a
circle it's like playing dark souls
it'll get you there
this tears up which is an all stats up
okay starting to get there
i don't know what we're gonna do though
um
yeah i don't know what we're gonna do
i'm trying to think about
what we got back here we got bob's brain
bob's brain is too spicy
man
i like it in general but i don't i don't
think it's right for us on this run
i think we're gonna go to the mirror
realm first maybe when we come back from
the mirror realm we'll feel differently
about
uh bob's brain
i have to remind myself that you you
gotta be and i apologize because this is
a little bit um rude to chat
but i gotta remind myself that most of
the time
chat gets a run that's like this they
just
hold r so i can't exclusively take their
advice
i have to remind myself instead that
um
i am one of the only fools on planet
earth that that sticks these out
and as a result i should trust my own
instinct
and honestly my own instinct for the
time being
says that this run is not that bad
i know it looks bad and and it certainly
has some negatives
i think libra was a definite negative in
the short term
but i do feel like it presents some
interesting long-term potential
now trying to remember the boss
it's literally the boss where all you
have to do is
walk in circles so put your money where
your mouth is
don't get hit get a new item the item it
doesn't matter what it is as long as it
stats
and then we're good
okay you just walk around in a circle
you got 12 bombs you could place down at
your leisure as well
good good worth it
not worth it but that's okay don't
complicate things everything's going
well here
you keep shooting because i don't even
know what the shots do like
they miss and they hit you you aim at
the enemy they miss you aim to miss they
hit
hp we re-roll believe it or not although
no
we take the hp and then we reroll bob's
brain instead okay
now we're talking
i've been a believer this whole time
heavy doubt energy
okay so it's still horrible like that's
not very good but
i'm proud of ourselves
we can at least look for second secret
room
i don't know this i've never seen a run
where both doubters and
believers are so uh confident they're
gonna lose
close close
nobody has any confidence right now
everybody is like i'm i'm out
i don't know i mean this could this is a
loss right now but uh
things change you know tough times never
last only tough people asked
et cetera et cetera
we take those we don't mind taking those
yeah i am getting used to the fact or
i'm struggling to get used to the fact
that when you play three and a half
hours of isaac on stream
that's like four runs
it's it's anti-nl technology
that's very good to know
keep it oh come on man i
the shots edmund the shots don't work
edmund
edmond the shots do not work they're
broken
it's too big for you i need to watch
that video before we reference it again
it's the video where the lady gets very
mad
mad at the guy in the hummer for parking
correctly even though she's parked
horribly
you know that one
please i just want the shots to go
straight occasionally
i hate watching those videos i don't
know that video is pretty sick
is this creep please come over here it's
creep
okay we have another damage source
saved oh do it okay okay so the shovel
we're gonna blow it up we're gonna pick
it up
we're gonna use it
we're gonna re-roll it what the heck is
that
it's all the foods mashed together binge
eater all you can eat
i have no idea oh
tractor beam tractor beam would go a
long way
i love like public freakout videos man
vancouver
i i think i talked about it yesterday
but it's a bit of a fever dream for me
i see okay i see what's happening here
vancouver shows up in in public freakout
like every day now
people throwing bikes through each
other's windows
it's kind of sick live in a very
entertaining city
the nightlife is you know not all it's
cracked up to be but the
the ambient culture is is very high
yeah any item pedestal could become hp
up i think for the time being that's
actually a pretty like
amazing get
but that being said i need to turn it
into
something different because we
desperately need stats okay that's
pretty sick
shops turning into it as well hey
i was thinking you jerk
shops doing this as well very nice
what's causing wacky broken tears
um it's this item called almond milk
that i think may just be bad as a joke
and i think the joke is on me
come on i i can't i can't lose my deal
with the devil because i need
uh to get my deal with the devil instead
don't leave yet don't okay you're fine
um
what the heck was that because we need
all stats
what are your stats doing i think i
think they're changing with
with almond milk i don't know maybe
let's be honest i don't have a great
grasp on the mechanics of the best at
times
maybe something with binge eater maybe
the more you eat the more your stats how
about that
makes you think oh taking hp ups gives
you a
massive temporary damage bonus and then
libra is spreading it out
this it's crazy like i think this run
might have the chance to win
now especially now that i know that
these buttons actually work
just trying to think we still have
batteries back there
this is a this is a re-roll
those are genuinely not good
i think we should do this wait wait hold
on
what do we need to leave this floor
nothing this this floor is fine we need
to give hp to leave the next floor which
doesn't seem like a problem
correct correct let's go
all stats baby
but they're decaying for some reason i
guess whenever did i did i get hp
instead no that
i picked up dinner instead oh my god
oh my god dude
how many memes is enough edmund
the next step all we need to do is make
it so when you pick up dinner it's
actually a 50
chance to not give you hp okay that's
too far i apologize it's just it's just
the salt talking but this is a
it's a little much you know
get the batteries
yeah we lost um we lost
access to the tears and shot speed up
which would have been pretty sick
but you know we'll keep it going and
we're still alive and
honestly we're gonna be pretty hard to
kill
i have no idea is that the knockout
shots
it is okay they're not stats but they
make funny noises so that's good enough
for me
it's not a big boss room i i am
having fun but i'm also i'm having fun
because i
enjoy being hurt digitally speaking
the zayn does not it doesn't bother me i
was born in it molded by it etc
etc some kind of digital masochist i
think that's a good way to describe it
yes
saved uh i we're never gonna hit with
any of these knockout punches man
like i'm slowly coming to terms with it
it will never happen
they just immediately fly into the
into the wall i'll i'll use my last bomb
saved absolutely incredible we needed
that deal with the devil we're not
taking hp we're taking the range because
we want all stats
okay there's something no no
ladies and gentlemen we got it okay
that's that's a huge
improvement it still kinda sucks
but that's a big improvement
[Laughter]
does it have normal shots it does oh my
god okay so we can almost just
play as if we're incubus now
so right now for those asking uh in chat
we are presently just trying to get on
locks like we're just grinding on locks
this is
we're trying to do isaac hard mode um
alt path right now so we got a ways to
go
we got uh i got some confidence
that's tough it's still very tricky and
if you just joined us this run really is
like
it's a bit of a wild one we have almond
milk which is uh like
bro really
i just want to hang out with this
judgment almond milk makes our tears all
funky
we also have a libra
which makes every item we get be all
funky
and then also all of our items become uh
hp upgrades if we don't pick them up at
the right time or they just sometimes
start his hp
upgrades get it i
hate you
i'm mad okay let's win the run i'm i'm
upset so we're gonna win the run
that's i'm actually mad at the game now
it doesn't happen too often
this is too much you
you've done you gotta done it now
you cheesed off the zane lord
i didn't think it was possible i've
maintained my cool for
for too long it's time to let the demon
within uh
escape and i don't know if i can put the
genie back in the bottle
we want technology i think that oh come
on
man you're a
purveyor of misery we definitely want
technology here i don't know if it's
gonna completely screw up our shots but
we gotta try
that seems awesome okay that that seems
like exactly what we're looking for
the ability to actually have our tears
go kind of where we want them to go
next step will be uh hopefully getting
some kind of
amazing tear effect or just getting so
many stat upgrades our damage is
uh hits the next level
vert pheromones
that's not so bad okay go ahead break it
open break it open
go ahead i'm not scared this bone heart
is not long for this world but i i
don't mind
good hit
saved
my god he's actually doing it infinite
range technology
that was so much easier than it had any
right to be okay we absolutely do wants
meet it's
hp plus all stats upgrade
hold on there you go i'll beat you your
own game
you son of a gun
now we don't lose the knife piece plus
.16 damage pog
yeah but don't forget about the fact
that we also got plus .16 tiers
now we got a lot left to do on this
floor we got to get the second knife
piece
um hopefully be able to go to the shop
i'm pessimistic but yeah whatever there
goes my boneheart
golden key would go a long way no doubt
about that
hey i just got here how's the stream
been macros you even gotta ask
come on man it was actually it was
pretty good
we played some good isaac um
knockout city a lot of fun as always
we although we did go up against the the
wayne gretzky of knockout city
trying to think do we have reroll
potential right now i don't know
now we're talking a key
i will go to the the curse room i mean
this is
this is beautiful is what i was gonna
say uh guppy items please
i don't mind walking diagonally i mean
we it's not like we have a shortage of
hp
you know oh that hurts completely uh
made up for the fact that we just got
meat
oh well um let's go back to
the shop dude trying to do this with
no knowledge of what the the map is
i'm realizing now like i don't think i'm
going to be done this run in 25 minutes
that's
that which is asinine
i think we started it with like an hour
and a half to spare
how dare you honestly at least it's a
static stat
repentance it uh it sucks up your time
no doubt
okay you know what okay here we go we're
going in first
i do want um i want to go to the shop we
got a re-roll i'm stoked for that
we got normal tears temporarily that's
pretty sick
we got a little crash bandicoot sequence
i really like this like actually this is
like a totally
welcome change for me
it's almost like a different game like a
a platforming section
i guess it's you know not really
platforming but you get the idea
like i think they did a great inversion
of the formula with this right here
plus like the i mean i'm gonna see it a
thousand times and you know inevitably
possibly get sick of it but
nice try the first time you see this and
you're just like what's happening
they get some tricks up their sleeves
plus like it's so easy that like
well i mean i deserve that
at the same time i did felt kind of
stuck there
let me in please
probably could have just done that from
the get-go the dodging is largely
trivial
it's just uh you know sometimes you get
stuck
good walking bad walking
good walking getting hit twice at that
that now that's embarrassing
do you get it really like a permanent
stat upgrade just for doing it though
no oh it's just you returning to your
stats from earlier
that's right okay where the heck
is the shop
just want to go to the shop man
it doesn't doesn't change anything it
just left him down okay thank you left
and down
and left and down
and and then down and then
yeah yeah there we go
have you have your have your jokes have
your laughs right now
it's by the time i'm done with this game
it's gonna be dismantled
i will take it
i don't mind keep it moving
i don't mind that's okay
in 2030 i can wait
trust me that's not a problem
okay now take me to the mausoleum i'm
just a notch in your bedpost and you're
just a line in a song
here we go that's good stuff
i oh you gotta hit the buttons first of
course you gotta hit the buttons first
keys please i'll take it i'm trying to
remember now all we have to do is beat
mom all
the funky stuff is like is done now
right
all we gotta do is play isaac now if if
i'm allowed to
funky kong now we're talking i gotta
tell you
okay first off i will take uh the
trinket but
i gotta tell ya i do you think that a
blood bag would go a long way
funny monkey
look at the monkey smile
hp please
i do i i don't even want to talk about
the fact that uh
you can't play two blood banks
simultaneously i i feel personally
attacked it was all fun and games before
now now i feel personally attacked
okay never get on the cardinal
directions with these guys
he's learning how do smelly hearts
work when they break they create
an aura of uh aroma
enemies take six percent
psychic damage per second
sure
until they tell you to use deodorant
good punch good punch okay heavy
synergies please
i i'm begging you for something
something inspirational
you know what it's a it's a re-roll if
at first
i will at least check it
so re-roll and then it's it's you take
the hp
you keep taking the hp they keep
offering
it i'll keep taking it
also can i point out to you that yet
again i have no
knowledge of the map
should never have gone over there that
one's on me
i would just like to know where i'm
going
really if if for no other reason than
like being able to
backtrack oh my god here we go again
yeah yeah okay i'm very familiar with
that room that's a good one
and just make sure you don't walk uh
that way 17 times when you're trying to
backtrack
what if the enemies can step on the
teleporters that would be funny
i mean like of all the curses
this is the one that sammy sends me
through the freaking
roof man which is how i know that they
got me
and they got me good
please pick up this rock not that one
not that one if possible
thank you thank you saved
saved i was saved i was in the pool
the knockback is okay okay
time to reconvene get get your brain
set right okay pop a temperance card
blow it up
pick up some hp turn everything into
bombs
you wouldn't you wouldn't not in this
present state
yeah knockout drops is not doing uh
it's not doing what i hoped it would do
ace cards kill enemies now
now we're talking
we've never gone this way hey this is
just
it's madness right like
i i can't be the only one like i feel
have you ever seen network
i haven't but i feel like the guy from
the wikipedia description
like i'm mad as heck and i'm not gonna
take it anymore
we have to take rubber cement
okay i i think it might end up doing
double damage because the shots will
bounce off the wall and then hit
hit enemies but
bro every floor is 25 minutes long
because i gotta backtrack seven times i
don't even know where i am man
please i just i i beg for a
a wafer thin crumb of mercy
oh yeah thank you thank you get score
off the screen
amazing okay there you go that dude the
damage output is actually genuine now
thank you that's very nice of you
i could go to the curse room uh now i am
completely screwed i thought this was
the only way to get to the boss
i thought this was a 100 guarantee
[Laughter]
relax three question marks okay as long
as we're holding bad trip like we're in
a good spot
right down left okay
if we could get like a homing tears we'd
be in a good spot too
left hand i don't know i like i kind of
like having um
i like having child's heart i think here
for hp purposes
like the isaac meta is
is turned on its head
i really think hp is the most important
thing now
it's down there come on don't bait me
it is down here okay that i'll take
ownership for that
that's unbecoming of of a classic gamer
such as myself
who grew up on all of the contras
yeah we were already in the item room
that's where we got uh
rubber cement you're gonna take my
incubus
no no what the you took my knife
give it back give it back please
okay just land shots oh my god the only
safe place
to stand was impacted by a knife
that's fine this is this is why we stack
hp this is why we stack up the hp
okay there's a very simple choice you
take magic scab
that was only mausoleum one my my word
bomb the skull okay sure you got a
forgotten lullaby look at that
sing for your friends
i don't know what it is i hate to do
this but i'm sticking with the uh
with the child's heart for now
just because i really believe that the
red heart meta is the way to go
sqweep
okay i know what i must do
this is for all the times they said
boomer reflexes
you break this come on down come on over
how do i
oh i know i know what to do okay yeah
yeah squeeze
squeeb squeeze
i'll take that what a puzzle room
give us your familiars improved rate of
fire
don't stand on the cardinal directions
that's pretty good
you know i can see definitely a play
where like incubus is how you send that
one
or the you know it's the right way to
play with incubus i should say
i i don't even want to mention the fact
that obviously we got curse of the lost
uh yet again um that's just the
prerequisite at this point
at this point i would rather like what's
the point in buying the map or the
compass you might as well just remove
them from the game
they have no purpose anymore unless you
have black candle as well
it's a little much
but i guess i should consider myself
lucky that i can
at least see the enemies
we call that mercy
i'm really not i shouldn't salt up so
much it's just like this
the the same curse over and over is
getting a little
just getting a little tedious
that's the thing it's like i'm not i
wouldn't say i'm upset it's like
it's a bit much that's it it's it's a
bit much
like i'm not no you mad l no i'm not mad
lel but it is like a bit much
i think we try to take this one and we
just
guess that when the other item is up
it's probably also non-hp on the other
pedestal
ghost baby all right that's uh you can't
win them all
we say thank you for the opportunity on
that one
probably would have rather had slipped
rib but it is what it is
troll bomb that's a new one
do you have something that's causing you
to get more curses
um i do
you're gonna make me say it it's called
the dlc
okay hold up you give me a pedestal it
might swap
another judgment i don't mind actually i
don't mind we we got there's there's
plays to be made here
i i wish i hadn't popped them right next
to the door though
i mean at this point we might as well
just stand still
all right hp or hp and we're stuck and
we have to take it immediately
i'll take hp
at least he didn't give me something
useless like the map you know
hp or the nail so the nail is
not as good as in fact it's almost
useless unfortunately um
so i think we take the hp believe it or
not
we can't even fit the
we can't even fit the nail we could use
it for a damage bonus but
that's true i suppose we could have
taken it and then used uh a re-roll
pedestal on it later
it's a valid point
i'm i'm still optimistic though as
insane as it sounds like our damage is
kind of taking us there
um you know i think we kind of do like
the key we like it well enough at least
flying is is very much appreciated
now we're talking oh yeah hold on i got
it
yeah no like magician's good i got to go
back for a bad trip though bad trip is
like
a gimme okay i'll play you as well
because as long as we have bad trip this
is
this is okay this is how it goes man
this is the cycle of isaac for an hour
people have been like this runs horrible
all of a sudden after putting in this
much emotional labor people are like
it's impossible to lose
there's no doubt at all carried
[Laughter]
so what happens when you don't hold r
though you hold r you lose a lot of
you lose a lot of runs like this you're
missing out
you are also missing out on some misery
for sure
okay we'll take gimpy gimpy's actually
pretty huge because it can drop us a
bunch of uh
it drops a ton of red hearts
might as well just take it we don't need
keys for the next section so let's go
for it yeah yeah yeah
no it's heavily not useless it doesn't
give you the spirit hearts but it
increases the drop rate of uh
of red hearts
nope i know you stomped three times but
i forgot about that part okay we still
got a 36 percent
devil deal chance
lord knows i got hp to spare okay we got
a one percent devil deal chance
so here's a question for you
do we need the polaroid to fight the the
real final boss
no right
negative is a damage up now really
okay
look at that look at that
i was thinking about using a re-roll to
try to you know mill some
useful items out of there but damage up
is is useful
so no harm no foul
it's just just kill the boss please i
don't know what's happening
i'll just continue to stand still and uh
all right
i would say at this point the number one
thing preserving this run
is please don't i have a map oh my god
the number one thing preserving this run
is bad trip
if we can hold on to this bad trip pill
which is admittedly kind of tough if we
can hold on to this bad trip pill we're
going to be in a good spot
and obviously like the more hp we have
when we enter the boss fight even if we
have bad trip the better
i'm just i'm freaking zonked out of my
mind that i have a
i have a map dude
this is crazy talk
gets smacked
it happens i don't understand this is a
great run
you know you weren't here okay when i
was down in the trenches
you weren't here okay just for the love
of god do not screw this one up
you take brimstone that's a gimme
all right um
look i don't need to tell you what this
looks like
[Laughter]
can i just say it super sucker come
jetting machine
all right fine and we'll take that we'll
take the all stats
and then what the heck it's hp dude
okay this is this is tough just give it
a sec squeeze
the other one's not rotating okay
squeeze and then we we do the dub
re-rolls
i see hp books hp books
let's get some dude dude do it
let's get some more battery charges
the library play hp is good for the
record we could always take more hp
i'm gonna go back for bookworm bookworm
i'm just gonna wait for a charge just
gonna wait for a charge
i mean like look at this this is
it's very strong
i choose to leave this room
and never return
he's done it pro gaming
dude mom's key actually ended up being
like the most insane pickup on this run
is nl okay oh no that it's it's
happening already i thought it would
take a little longer
the jealousy is already starting to set
in
from the people who gave into their ego
and started playing on normal mode
because they thought hard mode was
unbeatable
and they're starting to knock on the
door is he okay
this is the run of the century and you
only get it
if you don't hold our how about that
there's a lesson in there somewhere oh
son of a
dog
no shame in playing on normal there's no
shame in playing on normal
just as long as you're not also uh in
chat typing
what is he doing or or saying ridiculous
stuff
like gimpy only gives you spirit hearts
like come on man
i guess i gotta go in all right
i forgot i forgot about the contra boss
you guys are lucky mouth didn't get this
synergy like he would never
it would be the lootest stream in twitch
history
a range up is not that bad it's on all
stats we've already seen everything in
here
i think we take the range up so we can
use our rerolls on the library
plus we got the mom transformation don't
care didn't ask plus your mom dunk
okay don't don't screw this part up
that was actually pretty close i'm sure
the homing would be sick but but i'm in
heavy reroll hours now
we got more books okay i've decided i no
longer care
and i'm heading down to the next floor
there's so many great jokes you could
i'm just stealing them from chat
just give me one sec to make this one
work tactical
uh what sprite tastes like
what mcdonald's sprite tastes like
next floor
what are you talking about i think his
brain is melting after so much
isaac we have full hp
i feel like i'm losing my i'm telling
you it's like i said earlier
face me in the moisty mire i just want
to talk
like i honestly everybody in chat that
they think they're so cool and hip and
good at isaac
i personally guarantee i could lift all
of you over my head easily
without my heart rate even crossing the
triple digits
probably many people enchant i could do
two at the same time
without a doubt
i'm 200 pounds i know what i said
and i stand by it
how is that a flex i'm saying when you
were still pp in your pampers i was
beating many challenges more difficult
than you
oh my god you are a biggest loser i've
ever seen
liars get out truth will always prevail
oh just you know just a second full
health
we could use this for mapping tough
times never last only tough people last
yes it's true malf did put me in a
chokehold
but i i must again reiterate okay this
we should be fine but before we do this
like this is your last chance so don't
be stupid about it
play the judgment
mouth put me in a chokehold but
it was a sucker punch even he admits it
by the way
i was i was down on my hands and knees
cleaning in advance of a party that we
were having
dude we got stats up temporarily
uh and and he jumped on my back
and he admitted he did it in a moment of
weakness because it was the only way he
could get the jump on me
and that's all you need to know
so i i know how this is gonna sound i
still don't think this is like an
automatic victory i i would give us like
a 90
chance of winning for sure but i also
like some of these shots i don't know
how to dodge
and he does have a billion hp
i do like the audio cue like even if
he's off screen you know you're hitting
them
when you hear took
if you if you're not hearing that it's
time to adjust your your vision
oh he's dead okay never mind it was
actually insanely easy
[Laughter]
i honestly thought he had like 10 times
more hp than that
meet cleaver has appeared in the
basement all right



i i think that we are gonna do
uh bethany greed
like we gotta we gotta do something i
don't wanna say to like kill the time
but like we we gotta unlock a couple of
things on the
on the post-it note we got 30 minutes
until knockout city
might as well try doing some uh some
greed with bethany
i have no memory of how this works at
all
but we're gonna do it anyway so you
definitely yeah yeah hold on you shoot
these first
mind if i play greed
yeah wait do we not
pick oh you know you don't step on the
button that's the ticket
oh no he dabs oh
luffy one piece never dabs
i'm going back to crunchyroll
that's about all i know about anime
there's a long running series called the
one piece
i forget the name of the main character
but it's luffy something
and they wear a a floppy hat
monkey d luffy of course i think it has
something to do with like pirates
they're pirates or something on an
airship is that correct
yep they're pirates i told you man
i know all there is to know about anime
ask me anything uh pikachu
got it i'm gonna be honest with you
i should have stepped on the button
should have stepped on the button
earlier it's a regular ship but it can
jump
naturally who's the strongest anime
character
goku next question
not wrong
goku is so strong he willingly lets
himself die on multiple occasions
throughout
the dragon ball saga
just to feel something like just to make
it interesting for the audience
he's like sure guess i'll die
goku loses to his wife that's because
he's also the smartest character
in uh in anime
cute idea except
oh no i forgot if you take too long you
get two bosses oh yes i forgot the other
boss is monstro
how is that a boomer i hate my wife joke
i i'm starting to think that chad are
the real ages
it doesn't even make any sense
it's a very it's an insubordinate and
shirlish take 24-hour ban
permanent let's make it a zoomer joke
um the strongest character in anime karl
marx probably
bernie sanders chon
there you go got him
freaking own dude but the honest answer
is still goku to be honest
yes sir dude three cent keys now we're
talking
that's actually i think this is pretty
good as long as the
not many enemies fly i think this is
fine
well be that as it may
wait a minute you do this you get a deal
with the devil i remember i remember
but we can't get spirit hearts so we got
to be careful what we're looking for is
an active item
a one-room charge active item
would actually take us into the
stratosphere of bethany right now
i i know something's twisted up in my
brain
because i actually
100 believe
that jacob and esau are better than
uh bethany so the fact that i
think that has me knowing that i'm i'm
broken on a human level
so we need to figure out what's going on
with bethany in order to actually get
her to that next level
it's an angel room that's actually a
pretty sick
angel item although we will be hit quite
frequently
i don't know if bethany's bad but i
think she's a character for whom
the the item is very much uh like her
her quality is dependent on the the
space bar item she gets
knockout drops those are high knock-back
tiers maybe
i i respect the hp love the hp
um well we have full hp right now
you know what i'm going to throw that
away immediately get something like that
going on
now we start the synergies
in general i prefer not to buy
when we have curse of the unknown
oh that's not crawl space baited not
cursed the unknown curse of the blind
oh i forgot the fist tears it makes a
cool sound too
okay there you go we got wisps keep
crown alike going
yeah money's too pretty this isn't
greedier but still money's too precious
to just be throwing it away
on on random question marks we'll save
for the next floor when we actually know
what we're buying
i think it's cute all you all you uh
nerds in chat backseating nl
you know you wouldn't say that stuff to
his face irl
he gets the hottest synergies he has the
zaniest runs
and he hangs out with the coolest
familiars
i'll have you know i have over 300
confirmed greedier mode victories
graduated top of my class from golden
god academy
the sound is amazing
do you know what's sick i like i i know
this is character growth okay i know
you're on the internet you're not
supposed to ever change
um i've talked a lot over the years very
ignorantly about how i thought daylight
savings
was stupid and i hate it and also had
the absolutely brain dead take
that uh fallback is better than spring
forward
i gotta tell you
springing forward has actually improved
my mood like
75 it's such a huge difference between
like
cooking dinner at like 7 p.m
and the sun is still out versus cooking
dinner at 6 p.m
and it's like as dark as it is at 3 in
the morning
like i just feel like a like a better
human being now
now i think they should just stop doing
daylight savings to begin with
but i i've recently come to terms with
the fact i think i will be a little
sad if we fall back
and i think we are falling back this
year in bc even though we're supposed to
not
you know all the that's the tears up now
let's go
all the uh all the action items on the
political agenda got sidelined because
of covet including daylight savings but
left was god hand god head i data mine
the seed
son of a
anyway daylight savings is is
i i think it's sick now that's my take
okay hold on i need corey here to tell
me which one of the
bones this is we've had this item so
much
now we can see items now you see me now
you don't
what's the name of the guy in in now you
see me now you don't
wait no i'm thinking of the movie 21
never mind
in 21 there's a british actor
oh we should have yeared the coins
instead i just yeared the shop like a
fool
no no he's also he's jim sturgis i think
is his name but just popped into my head
he's the um he's also the
the male lead in across the universe
whatever happened to that guy
wait really jesse eisenberg is in both
movies
i knew he was in now you see me i didn't
know he was in
forever 21.
i forgot it blows up now actually that's
okay i'm glad we saved the money
this gives us spirit hearts we don't
like them i don't like this either
though hold
on i think we buy none and just survive
even though there's like a restock
potential here i think you buy none and
live
and then buy heavy on the next floor
we should have used a little money for a
reroll though i think
no and now you see me the the wizards
are not
or the magicians are not wizards they're
just liars and thieves
that being said i haven't seen the movie
but i i've and this is like a
five-year-old bit
you know stolen from my own content at
this point um
but i i always will consider them
cowards for not naming the sequel now
you
don't like that would it they made a
movie it was bizarrely successful
called now you see me
sequel comes out what do they call it
now you see me too
come on like you had you had your chance
you blew it
sad
now it probably wouldn't have made the
movie any better but it would have been
a
would have been cool oh no
all the original fans of now you see me
won't know that there's a sequel out
i mean possibly but
it's confirmed worse than mamma mia oh
no
i haven't seen mamma mia i i don't know
maybe mamma mia is not that bad
i always get mamma mia confused with
hairspray mostly because i've seen
neither of them but
it's horrible hairspray is great right
like people love hairspray
but i also i mean i think it's because
they came out at a similar time
i also get mamma mia confused with uh
julie and julia
like that's just seven different names
for the same movie for me
i know one of them's a musical or
actually two of them are musicals i
guess but
don't lose the phone hard dude i gotta
keep them in my sights
like soldier 76.
the smacks send them send them
one more room
monstro monstro 2
monstro with no brim monstro monstro
with rice
uh it's 10 out of 10.
oh hey hey hey hey easy there
mamma mia and hairspray are both
fantastic
i should see more musicals sorry zoomers
cover your ears
i should see more musicals instead of
just listening to the hamilton
soundtrack over and over again but
yo dang raid hello daniel hello
how were your isaac runs
uh it's godhead
you love to see it
so that must have been sacred heart
earlier
dan raiders have been real quiet since
the new angel run just dropped
i wish we could get spirit hearts to
protect crown of light but
it is what it is what what are you big
league
chew supper oh that's right
all right now we buy
what's the best musical and why is it
the blues brothers yo no joke
blues brothers actually like incredible
movie
i'm not sold on ontaro cloth on this run
although it could be awesome where are
we getting cards from
that were i mean we get some from tarot
cloth but
i think i'd rather roll for stats
okay lump of coal i think is going to be
sick for us
spider i think is or the fly i think is
good for the
the refresh and it's pretty cheap i
actually think that the relic is
uh it's pretty low here
because it it doesn't it only pays out
with wisp charges
and it got nerfed anyway don't care
didn't ask plus you got nerfed
that's a damage upgrade now we chill
that was really good that was a very
very solid room
yo new blinding light just dropped
this is pretty cool man we got a good
run going on here
we've even got wisps wisps have actually
been created
who would have thought you could crush a
bethany run without even getting a space
bar item
not me
i can't tell if ryan actually likes
musicals or not previously i have been
a musical hater because i applied
like south park logic to them which is
like you know
uh well why don't you just have like a
conversation instead
um as i've gotten older and i've
listened to more
i'm actually like uh i'm more into them
to be honest
because sometimes songs are
better than talking well well well
oh my god we just kicked the crap out of
him
like you know what i would love to see i
would love to see aaron sorkin make a
musical
maybe about like what it's like to be
the secretary of state or something like
that
now that would be david fincher directs
aaron sorkin's first musical
it would be the biggest box office
release
in msnbc's history uh
so this is a spicy one uh i think i'm
gonna go shield
because i don't think that these like
has this been changed and buffed or is
this good
is this because this was they buffed it
okay i'm gonna believe you temporarily
i don't know it kind of looks cool at
least
i'll give it some props for looking cool
debated lol
how this dude since when is this run so
long
well new bible just dropped wait a
minute isn't there a floor on which if
we use this we die
is it this floor
the gas baby oh no more curse of
darkness
the heck is that magic eight ball
i don't think i'm gonna press it i think
i'm gonna roll wispless i'm gonna
missing the whipless
that lead off the sweetness away you
know you know but i'm talking about the
shins
any garden state fans here this one goes
out to all the garden state fans
i just watched your skyrim series it's
ironic
back then you used to talk about
hamilton with a bit of contempt
i too uh find it ironic that that old me
uh used to have such strong opinions on
things that i'd
never interfaced with
the infinity bff's okay uh uh what
just happened
wait hold on did did bff just make
aquarius cover the whole floor
i don't know what happened there
apparently not but
oh those were the wisps from the
infinity
really oh it's just bugged oh fair
enough
bff and wisps bug out try any tribe
called quest fans here
this is a very very good run
it's it just got a little bit better
okay
i i have no bomb i could get a bomb but
i don't
remember what oh we still got one more
floor dude it never ends
what the heck what the heck is this
allowed
it's a great seat
i don't even know where the items are
coming from i'm happy with them no
matter what i
i love the even though it's a bug it's
pretty sick
it's very funny as are the sounds
like this run is like very high on
slapstick right now
i'm for that yeah is it that bethany
only gets angel deals or did we just get
like lucky and and get angel deals
instead of devil deals
i don't know i have no
no concept or clue
we do have homing aquarius yeah so
someone in chat said that aquarius has
uh
it it inherits tear effects from the run
a book of virtues of course
so aquarius might actually be kind of
good now so this is a big tears up right
we take those plus one to your lowest
stat we don't take those
oh we had infinite wisps
i want i want them back infinite wisps
please
those are not infinite
nevertheless um
what the heck is this chewing gum eraser
erase thine enemy
infinite wisps
no wisps
oh i forgot
scared the crap out of me man
go ahead go ahead i got my rubber made
get sent
all right i think i think we probably
got this under control
super armor though still kind of
annoying
boss armor i sleep hey you can't sleep
on this one look
can you hear the the smacking sounds
it's like you're watching uh
kung pao right now
he's dead he's broken he's actually
broken
he got lost in the peria
yeah i am excited like i don't want to
spoil anything but i have heard that uh
you know there is perhaps more isaac
than meets the eye
so and we may barely be like at the
beginning of a new generation of isaac
style content
it's it's exciting man what the heck i
never played green mode on this
you're telling me i got to put 999 cents
in this thing again
well we did unlock something there i
don't know what it was but



yeah yeah yeah here we go here we go
unban all i would never i'm i i only
touch my own on band requests i would
never do it for another streamer that's
unless they asked
all right let me get chad over here
how to get unbanned from apollo's chat i
don't know you can like
you know there's like a send a non-ban
request apologize and then maybe like
you know if you don't get unbanned in
like a week like tweet a mod or
something i don't know though like to be
honest i think
i know how this sounds but like i feel
like there's chats on twitch where if
you just
if you get banned you're just toasted
like you're just done
and uh
that that might be one of them on on my
chat i'm
pretty open with the unban requests
like especially like if you did
something
really bad like yesterday and you're
like i've changed i'm like
see in 180 days but um
if uh if you did something like the
message is from like six years ago or
something like that
and you're like you know i'm sorry i was
like 12
then yeah you get on bands
that's about it but i think there's some
channels where you're just toasted
but i would say like i would probably be
banned in apollo's chat if we weren't
friends
i would probably be banned in a few
chats if we weren't friends like in
apollo's chat i
i i'm an agitator i try to agitate
he tries to agitate here a little bit as
well don't get me wrong but
i definitely like i go in there and i
try to i try to kick up a little dirt
the only channel i know that i got
banned on i was watching
denny's like in 2014
they were doing like this arcade
competition where they had like a
frogger and an asteroids cabinet but
they changed like the lily pads to
pancakes
or something like that and i just
remember typing
in chat and like i was typing way too
fast and they uh
they eated me sent me to the shadow
realm
um do you think glowing hourglass
no because you get hit you probably
can't use it i'm thinking
i don't know i don't think it'll work
but tarot cloth ooh baby
now that's a combo i saw david you got
banned from that too
how can the developer of cook serve
delicious get banned
from a denny's stream that it doesn't
make any sense
son of a
yeah whatever i'm not scared
i'm not scared
i think i'm pretty like honestly we've
i almost just died there we've become
much more um
heavy-handed with the mods but i really
like
i mean the internet has just
consistently let me down
pretty much for my whole life right like
the reason i
didn't want to ever be super
heavy-handed with the mods is because
or with the moderation rules at least is
because i was like
i think we can just set the tone and
it'll be like
you know it'll be fine and i also don't
want the chat to just always be like
and if you know every streamer is
entitled to make the rules the way they
want
but i never wanted my chat to just be
like um
wow like love you amazing because it
makes me feel kind of weird because i
don't have that much self-respect so
when people are like
you know wow you're amazing i'm like
shut up
liar but like it just it creates kind of
a weird vibe
and i don't think it's like unique to me
i think it's something that a lot of
people
go through you know an overly effusive
praise you're like
you know you're kind of like what's
wrong with this person
that they think i'm this cool um
so i actually i always liked that there
was like a little bit of
a little edge in chat but then like
way too many uh people use that as like
a
cover to just be like genuinely mean
and then like after they were mean if
you were like hey don't be mean they
were like well they're the
chat's a reflection of the streamer haha
got you played my trump card
chat's always a reflection of the
streamer so i'm not responsible for my
actions
so we had to we had to tighten up the
rules a little bit
um
which is fine like it's okay but
you know and then like i always judge
like
when whenever like we somebody gets hit
with like a mod decision
if they're really really anal about the
mod change i'm like this is exactly the
kind of person
that i was thinking of when i made the
rule
so i know that i'm on the right track
yeah it used to i mean it was never like
insanely lawless here
like i takes i i resent sometimes when
people are like oh it's like
it used to be like hell but it used to
be much worse
just in general the community used to be
like
i mean it's not even well it is
definitely rude actually but
um it's the community used to be
way too like
into the interactions between people
um as if they were like you know
couldn't handle it themselves like
adults
way too many like yeah serious posts and
like
like ev if an nlss was good
the after thread would have like six
comments so people would be like this
was fun
and if if there was like even the
slightest conflict on the show
there would be like 150 comments in the
thread and you're just like oh my god
dude
freaking it's terrible
this is so much better now
okay this is we're dead we're alive
it was a weird time for sure
why does this run suck we just got good
items
you should check out the denny's channel
it looks like they unban me let's go
not gonna lie reading those comments was
my version of watching reality tv
no i like i hear you completely because
sometimes like if a streamer messes up
i go to their uh their subreddit or i go
to like a live stream fail and i see all
the comments and i'm like
you know snacking and eating all the
watch reading along with the comments
and laughing right
but when it's about me i'm like no no
thank you
touch grass please
bugs bunny new exactly
is it harder to interact with chat as
you get larger
well first off thank you for saying i'm
getting larger i appreciate that
um but yes but i think it's good
like and this is uh i'm sure there's
other streamers that that say this i'm
just not privy to it
but like i'd like streams better
when the stream is entertaining
and not merely like a parroting of
things that are happening in chat
it depends like you know if if i'm in
the chat
like i want them to read my comment i
totally get it
but then sometimes i like watch a stream
and they're like just answering
you know like the same questions in chat
over and over and i'm like
i'm gonna watch like some like 19 year
old kid try to do like a handstand on
his uh
wii fit balance board and then fall over
and
like kick his shelf you know it is it's
a hard balance to strike you you got
that right
like when i'm on a wave of like when i
have
motivation for what to talk about i want
to keep talking
uh and i want to keep that momentum
going because i think it can lead to
some funny or entertaining dialogue
and then the other 93 of the stream
where i don't know what i'm gonna talk
about at all
you glance over to chad steal something
answer a few questions
that's my take on it
tv show with a phone in line when you
want it dude i think running a talk show
would be sick
i don't think you could do it on uh
on twitch without probably accidentally
getting yourself banned but
yeah code miko i mean she's been i don't
know been banned like three times or
whatever
so like i that's what i'm saying it's
like a spicy line to
to ride
but if you can if you can strike that
balance i think it's cool
i do think it's a you know it's just a
philosophical difference
lock way up i have no idea this is worth
anything and we're giving up like an
incredible item
or an incredible trinket for us at least
dude i mean i okay so like we can get
demon hearts out of bad phd which is
worth nothing for us
succubus is kind of incredible though i
think it's worth giving it a try
and then i think you know what
let's take it let's have fun you'll lose
it once you take damage
oh no saved
what are your thoughts on hot tub
streamers dude so i have a very
simple uh philosophy related to like
what anybody else is doing on twitch
like it doesn't really matter to me
at all essentially like at all at all
and i don't i really don't understand
like why it matters
to other people as well
[Laughter]
because like i don't know maybe it's
because i i started on
it's booster pack right yeah maybe it's
because i started on youtube
saved and like on youtube people are
doing all sorts of crazy stuff right
and let me out
i wonder if you know what i got a genius
idea um
like it i never at all in my life i
guess have ever
looked at youtube and seen like somebody
like breaking the rules and been like ah
they're taking my viewers you know
i've always been like i'm not willing to
okay now you're gonna get me in trouble
in the other direction i was gonna say
i'm not willing to debase myself
to you know it's not the kind of content
i feel comfortable making to put it
politely
so i you know i i look at it as like you
know is twitches
and youtube in general as well it's a
huge pool right like
whatever people are doing i don't think
it really has an impact on me
and i i i don't know i just i'm
surprised that so many people who
appear to be like adults actually like
care about the like when stuff like that
is happening like when they're asleep
and like
get really mad about it online but maybe
i'm i'm missing
something related to it i don't know
these like people worry about it like
delegitimizing twitch and i'm like what
are you talking about
it's a site where people like play with
toys for a living
like the the biggest streamer on the
platform had to go offline yesterday
because he forgot to pay his electric
bill
like the website is it's not that
serious i don't understand why you
you're acting like they're gonna pop the
bubble of like
uh professionalism that we got going on
here
that's all i got like i don't know
i even the argument like the oh like
they make it so hard for like other
streamers to get discovered i'm like i
don't know what you're talking about
nobody is looking nobody that's looking
for that
is also simultaneously
shopping for your stream you know like
they're just it's two different
urges like in the sims they're
completely separate bars
they have no connection to one another
that's not to say that the hot tub
streams only
fill up one kind of bar i'm sure there's
a lot of trench and dialogue happening
as well
plus you can get horned up watching my
stream by accident every time i say
freaking
sexy succubus
see there you go anyway that's all i
like i don't think that's
delegitimizing twitch at all
anytime i see someone be like like i get
asked all the time like and now what do
you think about like current twitch
drama and i'm like the number one thing
i think is delegitimizing twitch is like
the 10 000 people under every post on
twitch
uh that they post on twitter i should
say being like what's
happening with the streamer this
streamer this streamer and yet this
stream are still around oh don't release
a new windbreaker just ban this person
instead
now i'm pretty that makes me way more
embarrassed about the platform than like
oh at 2am like somebody's wearing a
bikini on stream dude
doesn't bother me at all
i care about real things like you know
efficient market theory
i can fly it's okay hold on
you don't think advertisers are gonna
overreact to something negatively
i mean i what i don't think is i don't
think that question is where the
the anger comes from at all like
the streamers who are angry about this
stuff you know
that's kind of like a twitch corporate
issue instead of like you know
bunch of random uh people on on
twitter i just i'm just worried the
advertisers are gonna
are gonna be upset it's not me dude it's
the advertisers
okay keep it moving i mean we could
pivot off of this everyone agreed with
me i don't know why the vibe is uh
negative every time i looked at chat it
was like uh
people were like this guy's got it all
figured out and i was like thank you me
okay that's good stuff
i think the only realistic argument is
people want clear
understandings of the rules okay like i
understand that but
and this is where it's really just like
you know this is a me
thing but i'm like i don't understand
why you're so concerned with the
uh the rules all the time like are you
are you doing streams that are like
constantly pushing up against the rules
and you're like
lying awake at night that you're gonna
get banned or something like that like
i don't know man i'm not saying like oh
like would it what are you doing that's
causing the problem i mean i guess
that's literally what i'm saying but i'm
like
i guess i'm of the opinion that like for
the most part at least the way i stream
i don't run up against it
but then again you know i don't you know
toe the line by doing irl streams where
people do text-to-speech donations that
are like sound like threats in public
places and stuff like that so
it's just a different kind of different
kind of culture and vibe here i think
or yes watching every video that chad
links you uh
like uh dude there's nothing i could do
it was media share
what am i supposed to do not play the
video when people donate five dollars to
the stream
but anyway like i i shouldn't have even
talked about it not because like we went
down a negative road or anything like
that but just because
like i like existing as kind of like an
enclave if that makes sense
i like being within twitch but like
outside of twitch as well
what the thing is really cool about and
and there's other streamers like this as
well
but perhaps some more sodium chloride
next time
but we kind of like we didn't like bud
off of twitch culture we kind of like
imported the culture from
youtube that had already been cultivated
on the channel a little bit
which is is neat you know we kind of got
to
we imported an audience that already
existed
rather than having people like you know
bubble in from twitch at first and and
and then have to interface that way
because like i mean i said this many
times but like
when back in like 2013 it took me like
years to figure out what any twitch
emotes meant i didn't even know what
like
like pogchamp meant i was like when did
people use pogchamp it took me it took
me forever
that's that's how much i was uh tinted
skull
that's how much i was like riding my own
wave and then i was like oh
twitch emotes i'll never use those and
then i was like
wait a minute when i don't know what to
say i can just say
pog champ and everyone in chat will be
like this guy's hilarious
[Laughter]
yeah the card is glowing i think because
we have tarot cloth it's a little
it's a little weird but i'm for it
you said that already it's cause it's a
vod
he's cracked the code what's your
opinion on air fryers yo that's like
banter
kerosene i've been using our air fryer
literally every time i cook dinner last
night i had hello fresh
it was like have brussels sprouts peel
and
slice carrot into half inch rounds
and cut potatoes into quarters then put
them in the oven for 450
they're at 450 for 22 to 24 minutes
and i said nah dude you know what i'm
gonna do i'm gonna put those brussels
sprouts
and i'm gonna put those uh wait hold on
what time is it
uh we can maybe make boss rush i'm gonna
put those brussels sprouts and those
carrots
in the oven 450 for 20 minutes
and then i'm gonna take the potatoes i'm
gonna put those in the air fryer
400 for 20 minutes they came out
nice and crispy like so much
better i forgot you can't do that
turned out so much better than just oven
baked potatoes
i've become a a true believer
like anybody that gets bogged down in
the the argument of semantics about
whether like an air fryer is just an
oven
you're missing the point it's sick
it it crisps food like to an
unbelievable degree we're not gonna make
boss rush
now i don't know if you would cook
everything in it but like
i i absolutely i will i will
use the air fryer when i'm also using
the oven that's how much like i could
just throw the potatoes in the oven but
i'm like nah dude
it's worth it i'll use them both
you could totally get a regular oven
that has a convection setting as well
though
yeah i mean i suppose i could just you
know instead of buying an airfryer for
like 200 bucks i could just you know
pay someone to rip out my existing range
and then replace it with a brand new
oven even though this one's like only
two years old and then
i don't know spend like a couple grand
on a
a brand new oven that has a convection
setting in it or is literally just made
out of air fryers but
i don't know what's up with the anti-air
fryer agenda man it's crazy
people like i don't buy pots i just cook
things in the plate
i just put the ceramic plate on the
stove yeah it gets a little burned but
just leave my my food in a ziploc bag
out in the sun
come back 36 hours later it's all the
same
that's so slight logical extreme
caffeine pill dude how are we alive on
this busted run
like this is an embarrassment
okay never mind it's pretty good
donkey donkey donkey
like i'm kind of like all the proof i
need about an air fryer
cannot be found with
look all i'm trying to say is everything
you need to know about an air fryer
you'll figure out by tasting the food
not by getting
arguments online



everybody i'm excited as always we're
playing some repentance we got a little
meme rich i would say
during the uh the last few episodes
where we tried to be uh
you know the the world's zaniest bloody
mary player let's just you know act like
we've been there before
we're going to play as judas we're going
to get some hp upgrades we're going to
try to steamroll the alt path
like i know i'm capable of
[Laughter]
a little spooky little spooky
either way dude i know like i'm setting
up comedic timing right now
but now that i'm not like room one when
you're not
on the alt path it seems like i'm in
easy mode even though i have
one hp i would rather have like one hp
on the non alt floor than
have like 12 hp on the first alt floor
like it's too much
now that being said the shot speed of
the new enemies it can be a little spicy
time to time
did he unlock bethany yet oh you you
sweet summer child
not only have i unlocked bethany but
i've unlocked
the real gigabrain character
and or should i say characters
and i've gotten uh
a little bit further down the unlock
tree as well i might add
so this is a very uh tough choice here
to be honest with you
i don't know man what do you think about
uh
what do you think about book of belial
versus jar of flies
well book of belial plus seven cents
worth is versus jar of flies i'm a jar
man i think personally
scales better with your damage it's a
set it and forget it type of item i'm a
fan
hmm well um black hole i don't
love however
we can at least use it to do that that's
a pretty good return on your investment
that's not bad either honestly this is a
pretty good uh
yo this is a tuning fork man you know
what it looks like it looks like the
pinch emoji
what are you trying to say edmund what
are you trying to say
what i've learned about isaac so far is
uh
in repentance you gotta basically take
every available advantage that you can
get
you know in afterbirth plus i was used
to just bantering oh you know i've never
been to a long john silvers before he
said for the 30th time i'd love to go
sometime
even though i heard they weren't even
that good to begin with um
now i've got to like freaking fixate on
every single possible advantage because
you never know you need like
mom's knife brimstone nine lives abaddon
mauve the void and the other guppy items
just to have a chance to
to survive for four floors it's crazy
those hush puppies though can i can i
ask you something i don't know what a
hush puppy is i've eaten a few in my day
is it just excess batter that has then
been
like deep fried
it's just fried batter it's fried
cornmeal i had no idea thank you for the
the intel i honestly did not know
isn't a hush puppy a slushie okay i
don't know if that's a canadian thing
but you're actually right
like um we do have
he's uh genius we do have a a brand of
very popular slushie called hush puppy
it is like a blue dog with white ears
and it's on the side of those plastic
jugs with the little mixer in it that
goes around like
oh they're called slush puppies slush
puppies that's right
my mistake
i haven't been to a gas station with a
slush puppy in a long time
long time
i say no to this
i'm i'm all down with the deep fried
stuff man i'm i'm with it either way
pretty much no matter what they've deep
fried i'm down with it
as a new viewer i desire to know your
opinion on salad dressings
um i'm uh i so here's the thing
in general i prefer a vinegar-based
salad dressing to uh like a mayonnaise
or sour cream based salad dressing
but the exception there is that
like caesar dressing and ranch dressing
i wish they weren't but they are they're
delicious
love them both
i don't get down with like the french
dressing or the russian dressing too
much
maybe on a reuben i'm gonna let i'm
gonna think about this for a moment i'm
just gonna think about this for a moment
don't let it percolate out through the
old brain area
this is a tough decision because like i
think mysterious multi-dimensional baby
is actually like pretty good
uh but the downside is that what the
other item could be anything
[Laughter]
that's my opinion on salad dressing
probably not as divisive as
as you would have thought but um
that's that's what i got
and that's it i love it or hate it you
watched
that's all you could do i'm pro ranch
i know like a a lot of people are
anti-ranch
i i would first point out that uh i
don't know how
accurate the caricature is that like if
you live
uh you know let's say like below the
state of illinois
90 of your meals contain a component of
ranch dressing
uh i we don't have that same let's go
[Applause]
we don't have that same kind of uh
prevalence of it here
so i i get ranch quite rarely
and i enjoy it a great deal
i like ranch flavored things as well
but i don't get it too much so like
that's maybe that's why i like it
now we gotta strike a balance here i'm
gonna say four tiers
uh per second is good enough because i i
really wanted to uh
keep our hp as high as possible as well
you get a tears upgrade every time you
you lose a bone heart with brittle bones
so i i took some damage but i i will
admit
i i respect hp in this as this character
as well
or not is this character just in general
okay i'll play it one time
what do you think about weighted
blankets we need the speed unfortunately
weighted blankets i don't have one um
but we got a
a weighted um
sleep sack for our baby and she's been
sleeping like a freaking dream
it's beautiful
how dare you after everything we've been
through
i got nothing against uh a weighted
blanket
you know why not not hurting anybody
i mean i sleep with earbuds in which is
really kind of like having a weighted
blanket
uh you know for your uh
for your mind like for your brain uh
okay let's
this is a little spicy but also
i'm willing to i'm willing to go a
little hard here
and then you know what i think i will
take trash phd
worse pills and evil up lock down
but lock down would also give us a
damage up right
yeah go down to um i got no problem with
that
that gives us a demon heart then let's
sacrifice a little bit more health to
get something out of this guy maybe
a ho ho um yes
yes yes okay i don't know this is
this is mighty interesting let's put it
that way losing the the
jar of flies is something that's not
necessarily amazing
but constantly getting i mean let me put
it this way
i'll go lock down all day that doesn't
bother me in the slightest
to get a damage upgrade at the cost of
my luck
no concerns and then to use
like our our pseudo trash pills will
become demon hearts
bro i mean it would be mighty nice like
we would probably be able to get uh
we'd probably be able to win with that
i'm sorry to say that i think it has to
be done even though it ruins our
our the synergy we literally just got
it it kind of has to be taken to give us
a chance to win
it's not anti-zane and i'll tell you why
we're still going to get pills no matter
what they they spawn constantly whether
we want them or not
and then secondarily the alt path is
freaking hard man
getting some some demon hearts is is
extremely
uh prudent
it only gives half demon hearts snail or
half spirit hearts okay that's a ripoff
i'd like to speak to the manager
oh dude freezer baby is sick anyway i
still think it's positive
you know you can't judge something based
on you know the nerf necessarily you
gotta judge it based on its impact
i think it's impact even if it only
gives us half a heart i think is
uh it's quite valuable freezer baby is
incredible too
like this this is a darn good setup we
got to save two bombs
i don't know what you do so i need you
to die because i think you create
like a cloud and win that cloud explodes
like everything inside of the vapor
explodes as well
so i'm just gonna try to keep you at a
distance what the heck is that your
elbow
youtube we like it okay
it's a lock upgrade okay look at that
look at that we're back
we can actually pick up
some pills from this point onwards
anyway minus one luck we're pogged up
how do you feel about mayonnaise
do can i tell you something last night i
made some like
uh salmon shawarma and the garlic sauce
was literally just
chopped i need this like minced garlic
mixed with mayonnaise and lemon juice
mayonnaise i don't really love that much
then when i put the lemon juice and
bro my alt path that's that's fine we'll
just do it next floor
yeah we'll do it next floor um
when i just think about mayonnaise by
itself i'm like ah whatever
when you add garlic and and lemon juice
to it i was like wait a minute this is
actually delicious
you didn't even go to the mirror
dimension
here we go again that's what i get man
that's what i get i i try to bring
banter to the to the
equation
that's what i get
thanks for asking me the questions chad
trying to be entertained i really
appreciate it
hold on hold on this is this is one you
just gotta do
thank you mods you're so good how did
you know we like a hundred messages came
in
and you knew exactly which one i was
about to hit with the 24-hour band
permanent
okay let's live here let's live yeah i
thank you apology accepted for asking
about the mayonnaise there's like a lot
of new stuff in the game i i gotta
prioritize my own brain okay
should have used yogurt instead you you
could direct your uh
concerns to the hellofresh corporation
it i it came with the mayonnaise in the
in the meal prep kit as a result i was
kind of gated by
supply no you didn't come
on because like someone in chat said i
used to date a guy who wants to
wash his face with mayonnaise no you
didn't
stop lying nobody like that go post that
on
workshop that a little bit and then post
it on our slash relationships
hello my boyfriend 27 male washes his
face with mayonnaise
i keep telling him to stop but he
refuses he says it's good for his skin
what can i do and then it'll get posted
by the twitter account that's like r
slash reddit ships or whatever
there's no no you didn't nobody
explained to me the origin story of how
this person started washing their face
with mayonnaise
and i because i i can't imagine
oil and dry skin it could work no
they they make like lotion it's probably
cheaper to use on your face than
mayonnaise to begin with
that's like only my boyfriend washes his
face with gasoline
you know hey it's petroleum you know
petroleum jelly
we need we need more than one degree of
plausibility okay
this this didn't happen
wait big ed from 90 day fiance actually
does that all right let's explore this a
little bit
is that true i didn't watch much of big
ed's season
i do have to tell you by the way i did
not um
we were talking about um marriage or
mortgage last night the netflix show
where you
uh i'm fine
uh well not you but couples choose
whether or not uh
to use like a real estate agent and a
wedding planner compete to try to get a
couple to choose their dream wedding
over a five percent down payment on a
house
um i uh i watched literally about four
seconds and then i said
absolutely not not my brand of trash
and then i literally did not get through
the first couch interview it was too
much for me
and then i watched uh eric andre's
prank movie bad trip
and i i thought it was enjoyable
this is my first time watching something
on netflix in um
probably three or four months and i i i
said you know what this is funny i i
i laughed out loud multiple times
throughout the
the movie i would give it a
a thumbs up
i enjoyed it lol exactly
i give it an lol for laughed out loud
i did not lmao at any point
but i did well no there were a couple i
know spoilers
there might have been some times i think
kate would describe myself as having
lmaoed
what would you give it on the mouth
scale so i haven't watched
a lot of movies recently um
we if i don't see something gold here
we're going gold
here um
i i haven't watched that many comedies
recently i watched the
uh i watched half of the impractical
jokers movie
and for a movie that's in very
surprisingly kind of similar
bad trip is much better
why my the choice of movie i watch is
entirely dictated by what's on
television
at the time that i watched
pretty much
hey hey what the
yeah i wasn't like so i watched uh eric
andre's last stand-up special
i didn't love it
i thought it had some funny stuff in it
but it it there was a little
you know there's a little up and down
but uh the bad trip as a movie i was
like this is this is a solid movie for
sure
i'm trapped oh
we have an easter baby today
how about that
hello my easter baby
hey now i know why they call it good
friday
could i show her the bunnies
oh she'll show off her clothing okay
steal this look yeah hey
hey baby okay
there you go
she looks like she's from stardew valley
i told kate yesterday but i took the
baby for a walk
and uh hold on can i get in here
yes um
after like 10 minutes she was just
chilling
after half an hour she was like asleep
like this
after 45 minutes she was asleep like
you know like when they when they put
the astronauts in like the zero g
simulator and or the the g4 simulator
and they spin them around until they
pass out
she looked like that she was like only
the harness was was keeping her up
it's a cool looking baby no doubt about
that
happy easter good friday happy 40th uh
day since the vernal equinox
since pascal's full moon rock tinted in
the room after the big room
buddy i'm gonna need you to look at the
amount of bombs on my person right now
would you describe this as an all-cap
situation right now
i will not be hit
i like this boss i'm still any new boss
i'm mad at oh he's got his elbows out
again any new boss
i'm mad at because i don't know how to
dodge them all right now
now the all caps may return
thank you if you're staying down for a
minute i'm sure tomo's gonna walk back
in in a second anyway
but um someone said dan's chat
has desensitized me to all chat or all
caps
i i was dying in dan's chat earlier he
played as the keeper
oh i really thought that would get both
but he was playing as the keeper
and he walked into one of the alt path
rooms that had the
item rooms i should say that had like a
an item and then a question mark
the item was sack of pennies
and he just like waited 45 seconds and
then took the other item
i forget it was because he and his chat
were like distracted he was like you
know
you know chat what are the odds that
like you know
it was something like the mayonnaise
play that i just made you know what are
the odds that like mayonnaise and yogurt
are just the same thing with a different
name and i was the only person in chat
losing my mind i was stunned at the
culture difference
i'll i'll be like you know wrist deep
in banter and like chad will be like 99
like you left uh a coin behind 17 rooms
ago
dan basically walked into a room that
was like a free win
uh as the keeper and everybody in chat
was like
100 100 100 00 seventy five percent
and i was in chat going like please
please
take the take the sack of coins man
it'll change everything okay that's
that's pretty good i can i can live with
that
i was trying to get in the front seat
you're gonna have to do a little better
than this we'll take this just in case
we need it
what do you think about dan saying he
could beat you in a fight
16 months ago he'd be in the hospital
now he's probably right
i'm not in peak physical form
i think i i have nothing to complain
about there i think he's absolutely got
it uh
he's got it bang on
he has a degree in fitness exactly how
am i supposed to compete with somebody
who has a a master's degree
in kinesiology
he's been working out in the library
have you gotten a vaccine yet don't even
get me freaking started man don't even
get me freaking started
we're still and again like it's better
than we thought it would be like three
months ago but
30 to 35 year olds in in bc
scheduled for uh early june
so we still got a ways to go
i i was laughing because i i complained
about uh
like the how slow the vaccine was coming
in which is
i i get it by the way but i'm still
gonna complain because it sucks
i'm not saying there's any action items
but it's like i wish it was here
faster in bc at least but um
you're doing the same thing that i was
just gonna make fun of actually where
people are like oh must be nice
you might not have your vaccine but i
live in you know
brazil and my parents don't even have
their vaccine yet my
parents and i'm like yeah i live in
canada
my parents don't have the vaccine yet
either
we're on the same page you're trying to
get like weird stolen valor that you
don't even understand
that's the state of brazil that's the
state of canada man
okay hold on hold on
this is big this is good we definitely
want this
i think we want sack dagger as well
really it's like america is just
crushing the vaccine game right now
they they've been playing out of their
gourds
the rising through the power rankings
like crazy there's no doubt about it
you gotta you gotta recognize you know
that uh
there were there were some issues with
pandemic response i think it's polite to
say um
but also like i'm watching people you
know in texas
that don't have underlying conditions
just be like
like they're picking their own brands
it's crazy
they're like i'm gonna wait six days and
i'm gonna get the johnson johnson
instead of the pfizer and i'm like i'll
just can you just like spit in my mouth
after after you get it i'll just take
whatever i can get at this point
can i just can i just take can i smell
the vaccine before they
they shoot you up with it
just give me like a just a sample just
an amuse boosh if you will
yeah new york right now is anybody over
the age of 19.
dude i mean honestly like dad's sick am
i a little mad
yes but i'm not mad at the people
getting vaccinated i'm you know
i'm just mad in general
i just want mine the easiest way to make
me
genuinely happy for everybody instead of
begrudgingly happy while also lamenting
my own
unvaccinated uh state would be if they
just gave me the vaccine
think about think about how good that
would be
it's worth it man
i think for for the utilitarian good of
the world i should probably be next in
line
yo this was well worth it how fun would
that be
in 10 days 16 plus are legal in illinois
see that's the kind of stuff that'll
turn you into the joker man
when you when you watch uh
teenagers getting vaccinated in america
and then also
like heartwarming clips from like the
san diego zoo where they're
vaccinating like pandas and stuff like
that you're like come on
the pandas
all right we're doing well here
how much will the vaccine change your
behavior it seems like you stay inside a
lot
it'd be really nice to like let my
parents see their their only
granddaughter
just just minor superficial stuff like
that
it's not as important as other people
who are like really excited for like
patio season
and like you know having some pints uh
with their friends but
just just minor selfish stuff like uh
like that
[Laughter]
wait wait wait okay hold on balloon what
is this a red bag
all right let me let me close this door
real quick
okay okay
enemies shoot red tears when killed i
don't know how good it is
but it's worth something
but is it worth as much as
gimpy i don't think so hold on hold on
it has to be done
it's very simple i wish you could give
like a timeout message the message is
just be nice
anyway moving on i think we made the
right decision on that one
mods are there timeout requests
like on timeout requests you know how
there's like
like real court and then there's like
small claims court where it's like oh he
scratched my truck or whatever
there should be like small claims on
band requests
there's a use of channel points there
somewhere ah
now we're talking
now we're talking okay let me think let
me think this is ash pit one
ash pit one
means we don't have to worry about
getting the mine carts on this on this
floor
we need hp though like hp is is precious
here
if we got enough uh red hearts actually
gimpy can probably
stand a reasonable chance of helping us
get to a win or or a reasonable
facsimile of a win
um right now it's not quite good enough
we don't have the red hard base to make
it work i'm calling that that enemy that
i just murdered without
even seeing them there actually the most
annoying enemy in the game
the like little baby larry juniors or
whatever
little baby skull x's
can only be hurt for like you know one
nano second
that hurts man that hurts good deal with
the devil though
dude freaking nine lives nine lives with
slap right now
sadly nothing takeable i wish it weren't
the case i took too much damage
can't be done
guppy's caller is nine lives on occasion
i suppose that's true
could be infinite lives you know nine
lives is nine lives but guppy's
collar could be anything it could even
be nine lives
i want you know what i haven't seen in a
shop in a hundred years
uh a reroll machine
see an awful lot this this would be
amazing hp
see an awful lot of shops that contain
absolutely nothing of value but
okay that's big hp now oh no
[Laughter]
hp we should we should remain very
thankful of
it's very precious
one bomb blows up the reroll machine now
you know what now that i've thought
about it for two seconds i actually
think that that's not a horrible change
but you could because you can just use
money instead you know i'll admit
fully like part of the issue
with like the the nerfs in the patch is
that i just got too used to
like the leverage you got from kind of
abusing the
abusing the things that maybe were not
meant to originally be like that
that's fine we'll just i mean we want
this demon judgment
yeah shops used to be like a serious
engine for just
dominating the game
no question there love golden bombs
love to see golden bombs
what are the nerfs oh it is i mean let
me count the ways right
a little spicy um lots of lots of items
got
nerfed the you know shops in general got
nerfed in hard mode
drop rates uh are way down in hard mode
i'm actually and i know how this sounds
like you can't say
something positive about a game without
being accused of being a shill
the only kind of criticism that comes
across as genuine is when you're mad
uh but i actually think making the game
harder was a wise decision
that's what we're looking for and the
the problem is less that
the game is harder and more that it was
so easy for so
long that like the nerfs seem unfair as
a result i think
you know the the culture that surrounded
isaac
from after birth plus onwards was like
you know we get used to winning 75 times
in a row without even focusing on the
game at all
so i think having a period where things
are a little difficult makes uh
it's refreshed it it is like
the runs are long
[Laughter]
dude but look at this if if we were
playing as judas in afterbirth plus
we never would have like had this uh
scrape to get to where we're at right
here
where we're like so excited to see a
second judgment
but we can still use this to possibly
get into a second secret room
uh and get like a bunch of spirit hearts
out of it
we'll talk about that in a second
i mean i think that uh
i it was easy to believe that isaac
didn't get that much easier and instead
it was just an unbelievable amount of
experience
that led to you know being able to win
90 to 95 percent of runs easily but now
i'm coming to terms with the fact that i
don't think that's the case
ah you're absolutely right i got two
golden chests here
it's it's a little pogged
yeah i think people will get used to it
for sure i mean the other thing is you
know if you if you play on the normal
path
can i push these hearts off of here that
would be nice if you play on the normal
path
it's still harder but it's not so much
harder as
to be like uh
like ridiculous that's still fine we'll
bring the
the portable slot machine into there um
the old path is insanely tough but the
the other path is not so bad
just just relax
we got like another i don't know
probably like four to five minutes on
this floor before we leave
don't save some adrenaline we're not
this is like floor three
maybe floor four now that i think about
it but
we it's a marathon this is a marathon
not a sprint
thank god we got luck stats
i screwed it up or maybe it's been
changed
i don't know but this it did not work
the way uh
the way i thought it would
why play in the cathedral some of you
ain't been here since uh after birth
plus and it shows
we got so many red hearts we're gonna
get a pay out here for sure
demon beggar no longer takes eternal
hearts before red hearts
that's something i i'm prone to believe
but i'm also going to say that
old habits die hard and also i don't
believe you
[Laughter]
it might be true but we got baited a
couple times over the course of isaac so
far
over the course of repentance's release
that i'm just gonna be uh
i'm gonna i'm gonna do things my own way
because it you know
i mean it doesn't seem to offer any
difference for the time being
i did see and and it's i i message dan
about it
because i want i want dan's insight how
is it that
um
mlb the show is made by sony
it used to be a sony exclusive
this year it's coming out uh on
xbox as well
is this our this is not our floor okay
i'm good i don't know
the blood bank maybe it doesn't take the
eternal hearts but still i don't want to
risk it
it's coming out on the xbox as well
free on game pass you you really i i was
uh i've got my playstation 5 in my
office for
you know recording purposes so i was
like i'm going to get mlb the show 21
for
playstation 5 because that's the console
that you know
if all other things are equal that's
what i'll get it for but now i'm like
man maybe i gotta move my xbox
into here because it's free on game pass
it's crazy
i mean it's a big get
mlb told them to release it on xbox or
you'll lose the license
could they do the same thing with pc
please if they're going to throw their
weight around
[Laughter]
i'm trying to think of what boss this is
we should try we should try
what uh uh flying
this is this is new to me and they leave
behind turrets huh
i've never seen this variant of the boss
before
yeah the show is sick i've blown up the
the turret
hey come on
at least they gave me some bombs
otherwise we could have been screwed
here
though that's so good okay we didn't get
the deal with the devil i was looking
for
but
we're gonna do this we're gonna do this
we're gonna do this okay
now we explore
i am stoked though but i am like you
know as it comes out for more consoles
like here's the thing
i guess i don't mind
uh exclusivity in the sense that i guess
i take it as
you know kind of a unnecessary evil of
competition
um but when it's only on two consoles
and not uh excuse me sci-fi
and not on pc i'm like come on man
just if you're gonna like you know kiss
and make up could you also do it on the
pc
like to be honest mostly selfishly for
me but still
scifly is a one run really
you know i'm excited to see if that ends
up being the case
how the heck do i watch nl's repentance
in order
there is a way to do it you're not gonna
want to hear it though
i'm being 100 serious with you um
you'd have to basically
figure out what day the youtube episode
for that day was recorded on
and then also watch all of the twitch
vods
every day in chronological order it's
doable
you know you you could watch if you
wanted to watch in chronological order
you would watch
uh the first episode the second episode
the third episode
then watch the entire uh series of
twitch vods from the first day
then you'll watch episode four then
you'll watch yesterday's whole isaac vod
then you'll watch episode 5 then you'll
watch all of today's twitch vod
the other thing you could do is like
don't worry about it too much just let
it go
and then accept that it's going to be
hard to watch it in chronological order
while we're playing a little bit on
youtube and a lot on twitch
and you know just just pog up i guess is
what i'm trying to say
i think that's that's the best way
there's a very like fuzzy through line
between both of them as well like
for the most part you're not missing too
much it's a lot of
mostly just banter coefficients
let me out please
i need to hit the button dude can i tell
you this is a spoiler
um yeah just uh pick one and then fall
asleep to it like
like my average viewer sonova
time to go back to among us
um i i did this earlier today
as jacob and esau and took no damage
i know you're not gonna believe it
you'll believe it when you see it and
you'll be ashamed of your words and your
deeds
is one of the proudest accomplishments
in in gaming i've ever achieved in my
life
nope see ya wouldn't want to be a
wouldn't wouldn't want to see you either
to be honest but definitely wouldn't
want to be a hello indie by the way i
see you indy
look doing uh
research for your next video 10 hottest
babes in isaac no clickbait edition
um he spawned on me
look at that no problem
got him
[Laughter]
number one mama mega for sure
for sure hmm
okay i gotta tell ya shoop the whoop
is pretty great guppy's head is nice but
shoot the whoop
i will not be persuaded
can you do an indie mouse impression
yeah it's it's like this
24-hour band permanent
you know what what if there's a crawl
space in there low odds let's get out of
here
all right we're still going
still alive mausoleum one let me tell
you i
i need hp here
excuse me do not refer to uh to indie
mouse as an
nl orbiter indie mouse is
is well on his way to like like many
content creators who have been inspired
by me indy's well on his way to being
uh better at the the youtube game than
i am
he got passed by by markiplier
um
small ant i think for sure
which is like it's my whole long term
business model is just to
inspire enough content creators that
strike it rich that one day i could be
like their little court jester
i could be like their worm tongue or
like the the little
weird rat that sits next to a jab of the
hut
somebody launches like a new variety
show i can be like
[Laughter]
it's kind of like i you know i've been
in the game too long it's
it's time for me to uh to
descend and and regress but in almost a
positive way i think
to uh to sidekick i think i think
i'm i'm done being the main guy just
make me a sidekick man that seems like
it seems like where it's at
or we could just start doing cameos
that's true
yeah i'm working on my ex's strategy
unfortunately they they kind of like got
rid of mcns on youtube so i can't just
like
you know start my own uh quote-unquote
business and then uh
take ten percent of like everybody
else's money on the platform
for doing nothing uh hold on hold on
i meant for doing uh something an
essential service
uh
yoink
[Laughter]
i don't know what sci-fly does but i do
know that when it touches something
they die instantly which is pretty sick
i've only seen episodes one three and
five of star wars how do i know
salacious crumbs name and also the name
of uh anakin's mom
oh you mean shmee skywalker
excuse me that now that that's a nerf
too far edmund when you get two blood
banks
you can't play both of them at the same
time that's too
far
that's that's a malicious nerf
and a salacious crumb where's the line
edmund
where's the line
well that was my bed
you can do it with a shield yeah for now
until repentance five the
re-repentancing comes out
there we go
whatever man i might just eat the whole
run here that's that's how i'm feeling
right now
it's a handful i mean i do appreciate
the money but
only one penny per hit too
when is it gonna be enough edmond when
is it going to be enough i'm being
mostly
facetious that one is though i'm like
hey come on
we we held on to that temperance car
that that's not like a situation where
you know that was happening all the time
i think that's that's a pretty
fringe case there
when will you learn that your actions
have consequences
i appreciate the banter injections by
the way toasty
when was the last time you donated blood
so it look i'm gonna pref
you got me i'm gonna preface this by
saying
it's donating blood is a good thing to
do the last time i donated blood
was maybe like a month after i came back
from korea
and uh i understand the reason for this
like why they feel like they need to ask
the questions
but uh in order to give blood it's
normally like a i don't know maybe like
an
hour long experience this time because i
had the audacity to go live in like
another first world country for uh
for a year um they had they took me into
a
private office and then pulled out a
binder and it had like
maps of south korea in it and they were
like did you ever
like step foot in this part of the
country and i'm like
i don't think so like i i mean i took
the train around on occasion but
uh i don't think i uh
i don't know if i ever walked through
like knee-high
grass in in yonsan or whatever right
like
so it it took like a long time
and just that was uh was enough for like
any time they've they harangued me from
that point onwards i was like
you know i i don't have that kind of
time quite frankly
back then and then uh secondarily like
when i moved to vancouver kate doesn't
uh like she has low iron
so she can't give blood uh so you know
we can't really make it a family thing
i'm not really trying to make excuses
i'm just saying that
you know
that's about it
[Laughter]
i think i'm like i can't get to the
chest so i can blow them up
but i can't get to them without stepping
on the spikes
oh let's go well worth it
but i don't know i've probably given
blood
i've been like like
20 times from the age of like 16
to 24.
i never minded it
i have uh oh i got the blanket that's
right i've been so like
lost in the banter sauce
i know this oh geez this is like the
ultimate like
complaints and this is more of a young
man's complaint for sure
the stars are calling okay
says the stars are calling gave me a
fool card
because that makes sense um
i think i made the right decision to
keep hp here i also forgot by the way
that this is an hp up so i am willing to
take it
i thought that was tnt maya sotis
i don't remember what you do but let's
do it um
i didn't i also didn't like when i
donated blood that like they made me sit
there
for 15 minutes admittedly they gave you
like a cookie don't get me wrong
i i i didn't enjoy that i was always
like i'm built different just let me go
i don't want to eat this cookie and like
watch everybody loves raymond or
whatever
i mean for other people i understand but
like come on
stop uh splitting
yeah plus they give you low tier snacks
i got to watch seinfeld and eat candy
bro that's
like maybe they're right about the
canadian medical system
wait hold on have i been to the item
room here
because i i don't know where i'm going
anymore i thought i did
yes no yes yes no no maybe
you got capricorn in it ah
some things they're just not worth it
man
no i'll do it for the vaccine for sure
i if they if you know i saw apollo tweet
like um
that he's driving two hours for the for
the vaccine
100 i would uh
i would do the same thing
i might even walk 500 miles to be honest
with you
would i walk 500 more no that's that's
too many that's a thousand miles
what was that was what was i talking
about i was talking about donating blood
oh yeah they always got like they
weren't
look sometimes i i donated blood and i
got
cool uh like they give you oreos or
something like that
those were the days man
but sometimes they only had like like
mom's oatmeal cookies or something like
that and i was like
come on just let me go dude you're gonna
make me watch half an episode of yes
dear
and give me like a a 30 cent cookie like
i'd rather just be home
okay so now i remember mystosis is
it gives you all the consumables you
didn't pick up on this floor on the next
floor
that's actually pretty sick
they're actually dad's oatmeal cookies
can i tell you what happened in my head
i said in my head i thought they were
dad's oatmeal cookies
they said moms because i was like dads
is a root beer
like you ever have dad's root beer in
the glass bottle
facts that was all
that was the only glass bottle soda when
i was a kid
in the 30s every soda was in a glass
bottle
in 2010 they got you know yaritos and
stuff like that
they've got mexican coke
back in the 90s everything was plastic
and we liked it
okay i don't like these enemies you got
it you got to hit him on the diagonal
i think now this is about the time where
we got to get uh
serious i should donate blood again for
sure
i know this is like it's the ultimate
like first world problem
i have absolutely no like needle phobia
or anything like that
i just wish they could make it faster
not like sucking the blood out but the
security protocols in advance that's the
only thing that like
and it's very entitled don't get me
wrong
but when i go there and they're like you
know
they're like hold on we gotta give you
this like 90 question survey
so that like we know your blood is good
and then also we got to take you into a
private room and ask you the same
questions again and again to make sure
that the your blood is good
and then even after that we're going to
test it anyway
like i don't mind them testing it
obviously you got to be safe but like
i don't know if it's changed over the
past eight or nine years but
it used to be like it was like
i don't know 15 minutes of getting your
blood drawn and then like an hour to an
hour and a half of like interstitial
stuff
i get it you want to be safe and and
canada had like a big uh
you know tainted blood scandal back in i
think like the late 80s or something
like that but
it does put a damper on it
okay one last item room
is pretty messed up i mean i i respect
the blood service too like uh oh you
know what i bet that makes a path it's
it's just science like kate got a couple
of
uh blood bags
there's a speed upgrade right now okay
kate got a couple of blood bags when
uh we were in the hospital after having
the baby so like
you know we've we've used it as well
you're my war zone good luck charm nl
you never use annoying stereo sound
and i very rarely play warzone
until recently at least um which means
like
isn't that i look i'm not just a
streamer i'm also a stream viewer
there's nothing worse than like you want
to play a game
but then the streamer is playing the
same game and sound is important so you
can't tell if the footsteps are in your
game or in justin's game
and you're like oh come on man like
while i play
valerian how about you play like
something else how about you play
getting over it
like it's all about my entertainment not
yours
chocolate milk
now we're talking that's me every time
you play king of retail
you know i i didn't even think about
that but
it makes perfect sense you'll be like
getting ptsd for my games
spare two seconds or mine minecraft was
bad too yeah
deep down in the mines watching mouth
stream and
and then you know you hear like creepers
and stuff like that oh come on man don't
make me do this to not get hit
and lose my bone heart
he's done it um you'll be down in the
mines and you'll hear like
and you're like oh come on
then you realize it wasn't uh it wasn't
on your screen at all it was on mouth
screen
that's why i think that if you're a good
streamer
you should be responsive to uh chat
feedback
so if someone in chat's like hey could
you please change games cause like i'm
playing this game
i i will never remember and by never i
mean this week
remember that you've gotta not walk into
mom anymore
my bone hard
we're obviously taking the polaroid
be like hey i'm playing isaac can you
change games i'll be like sure
let's play a game no one else is playing
okay
uh let's play artifact
[Laughter]
i still don't understand what scifly is
doing but i
i do i do appreciate it wait a minute
hold on now i get a chance to look at it
scifly is breaking all the shots and
then
shooting homing shots at mom's heart
for each shot that it breaks yo that's
pretty cool so i can just stand still
and not get hit
oh my god it might help us if we make it
to the true final boss it might help us
not get hit by all those knife shots
over and over
there's a chance
please don't try to bait me into
agreeing with the unabomber's manifesto
i i i promise you we we run in different
discord communities
i every discord except for my own that
i'm a part of
literally it has like two messages a day
and it's usually like happy birthday
don't compare us we are not the same
excuse me someone asked me if uh
the industrial revolution and its uh
consequences have been an absolute
disaster for humanity
you think i didn't see that uh uh
netflix original series where paul
bettany also known as vision plays the
unabomber and uh
i forget is it joel what's what macros
the australian actor
you know the one with no personality you
can never remember his name
you know no not joel edgerton the other
one that's
exactly like joel edgerton sam
worthington
sam worthington yes thank you thank you
eric bana excuse me eric banner
was amazing in the hulk and then
secondarily also amazing
in uh
season one of ugly uh not ugly betty
dirty john the student
two different media properties
yeah plus he's in troy
don't care didn't ask plus you're
from troy
sam worthington is british wrong
oh this is sick oh
that's gonna pay
for a lot of shops in the future
dirty john married my aunt really
it's a pretty uh it's a pretty spicy
podcast
season one of the the limited series
you know entertaining but uh you know
i didn't think it was that good uh
season
two i was like you know what christian
slater amanda pete
they're bringing the amanda heat in this
one
don't hit me with ha ha hit me with
hahahaha
very funny what's the worst response to
a joke that somebody could write in text
that is like laughing i'm gonna i'm
gonna
postulate a theory okay
lol lol lamou
lamou all good
ha i actually take some pride in
if somebody says ha i'm like they
probably did not laugh
but they think it's funny but they don't
want to let me know it's funny
because it would like feed my ego
they're like embarrassed that they
laughed
or they thought it was amusing if
somebody says
ha-ha-ha with no spaces between each of
the letters
i know that they did not find it funny
but they're just being polite
like if you look at it a chat log and
it's just like
every time you say something humorous
the other person replies ha ha ha no
space
run you you do not have compatible sense
of humors
you always got to mix it up right you
gotta do like
sometimes if somebody says two things
that are meant to be funny but aren't
they funny in a row
first one i hit him with the hahaha
secondly then i hit him with like a
like an lol then i go ha ha and then i
go i see what you did there
there's like there's a mix of them
what about ha ha i don't know
like those are the two worst without a
doubt
haha and hahaha both pretty bad
dude why is little brim take so long to
charge now
f wait the fly is doing amazing work
can you just keep keep doing what you're
doing brother thank you
no i'm saved
he's going too fast what the heck is
going on here
no i'm doing good work don't punish me
i'm doing good work
oh my god we didn't get hit
surprising um
so i'll tell you we cannot take
nine lives but we can definitely try
lusty blood
hp is is extremely tight
but we definitely
feel bad about lusty blood and i'm just
hoping that like
the way that we possibly win this run is
that sci-fly
blocks tons of shots on the corpse
that's that's the game plan
please be a fortune teller oh baby we
got four
luck
we'd stack up absolutely everything
to just try to get as many spirit hearts
as possible for the corpse fight
no i don't even need crystal ball
although it would be nice
come on did you see they added stonks
meme guy to fortnite named diamond hands
uh toasty i would refer you to
yesterday's stream we talked about this
many times
i'm a big fan of uh of diamond hands
it's not bad the only problem is like
fortnite is uh is analytics poison
not not for everybody obviously like
it's a popular game
but for 32 year old boomers who are not
very good at it
it's tough
no i had there you go i have not
mentioned my um
my yahoo news article yet
i did get an uh yahoo news wrote an
article about a viral clip i made
like six weeks ago
let's not take the spirit hearts yet i
shouldn't have even picked up the ones
that we have
uh and and the
pop the stars card right away don't take
me to the boss um
the article was about the time that like
i riffed on that idea that like how do
bald people know when
to stop washing their face and then i
went really close to the camera
and uh like made wrinkles on my forehead
and i was like where the wrinkles stop
that's where your face ends and your
head begins
um yeah i don't know they wrote an
article about it
and the article is just hilarious it's
like
you know noted witty streamer responds
to a cheeky request from a troll
and then they they mind like the chat
and also uh
like the live stream fails thread of the
clip for content and there it was they
were
gassing me up pretty good they were like
you know the comments that they chose
were like honestly this is the most
naturally funny guy on twitch as far as
i'm concerned
ben this guy's been entertaining me for
10 years and i don't think he's going to
stop anytime soon it's
uh it's so good
okay like we may actually win on this
run
like we're getting a lot of
uh we're getting a lot of useful stuff
here thanks yahoo i really appreciate it
ridden by brian letournet
[Laughter]
winning yeah chibly's been pretty quiet
since the yahoo news dropped
why are you playing the blood bank i
need all the help i can get really so
like my hypothesis is like we can play
this blood bank because we have the
uh the less than three right next to it
so the dream would be you know you get
another blood bag nice little speed plus
hp upgrade
i the the chat erupted in laughter and
memeing i did see that
i was i was laughing yesterday
what if they nerfed it well then we
winning is one thing but it's actually
better to have
the ability to get mad with
justification so i
we win either way really
they really and and i actually think
that this is like a
uh a positive change but it's gonna take
some getting used to
they really nerfed the incidence of
uh tinted rocks huh like it's it's crazy
i have decided to use one bomb
he's so good
no you're just missing them
no the creep
do we know this
i'll take it shut speed up
wait he's bald yet another streamer or
yet another chatter noted in the stream
questioning whether the streamer is
actually bald
is a recurring joke in his chat it's
that's top tier
journalism
so knockout city is gonna happen at one
so that's 38 minutes from now
um which is an awkward timing for a
an isaac episode because this one will
be done in the next uh i don't know two
hours or something like that but
we'll figure it out i've got faith in us
it is the the cross play
beto weekend so there actually is or at
least should be
a a panel below the stream
you can click on that and and
get yourself a little something
something get yourself involved in the
in the cross play beta that's available
this weekend
dunk duck dunk
so the utility of keeping the spirit of
hearts on the ground
is that we'd rather lose red hearts if
possible
i know we have to right now that's
that's a mistake it's like byob
right um we can leave
spirit hearts on the ground and then
pick them all up right when we're about
to fight the boss
which allows you to have uh as much hp
as possible before the boss
this is not my first rodeo we've you
know
we've had the grind you know some tough
achievements in this game before
comedic timing
these are a little tougher than than
even the usual but
you got to do something like this yeah
not only one time but two times
all right so this is what it all comes
down to this pill is pop in emergency
uh situations only
not a not a huge deal uh
we have 36 bombs
before and like we've put a lot into
this run
before we leave for the boss fight
we must search for the secret rooms they
could change everything
we must search for the second secret
rooms
you're the second best bald isaac player
i know
that's actually like a pretty good
compliment
because uh oh there's more spirit arts
back there yeah um
that's a pretty good compliment because
cory's really good
corey is a he's a good isaac gamer
he knows what he's doing
booster pack
actually very tempting i think we got a
look at least
yo mysterious liquid undefeated actual
like
like s-tier item
now that hurts it dude i'm gonna lose so
much hp on this room
those those those cards better be worth
it
like i don't even know how to fight
these guys man good good thank you
thank you scifly
it's not possible okay lovers is a great
card though
strength two of clubs two of hearts
okay two of diamonds you just pop two of
hearts strength lovers
we can only take one in two of our
hearts are statistically better than
strength they're lovers here
we'll try the pill it's it's bad but it
i don't think it's at the point where it
like
really compromises the the game
damage is not going to be like our sore
spot here it's it's definitely going to
be
uh it's definitely going to be hp
strength for the damage highly highly
false
meet me in pleasant park i just want to
talk
i don't even know what this does but you
know what okay occasional
poison shot or bad breath or something i
don't know
okay let's do it
okay we're tap shooting we're in a tap
shoot existence
sci-fly you're actually a god
okay scifly is incredible
i don't disagree it's actually cracked
now i'm hoping mysterious liquid does oh
i forgot about that part
i'm hoping mysterious liquid does my uh
dirty work for me here
that's fair keep it going yo
sci fly is is feasting dude
bad
yeah you gotta you gotta learn to move
there
yo if you keep cycling it's a lot harder
to get hit on that huh
i didn't know i just tried to like watch
the shots as they came in
he's learning oh we're definitely gonna
win
this is exciting especially after that
terrible play earlier
was the mirror play yeah this one i just
it can't be dodged
we'll worry about that one in in 70
years
come on you got to be dead dude like
it can't be dodged
he's done he's done okay that was tough
but
look at that who would have thought
first run of the day no big deal is in
90 minutes long basically
uh but we did
unlock akuldama whatever the heck that
means
thank you scifly uh for the support
slash marker
end of repentance



hey everybody we're checking out uh some
isaac today not sure if you've heard of
this game etc etc
uh get used to the joke you know we we
make it a lot here
we're playing jacob and esau and and
we're gonna try to get
just some no-life unlocks we're trying
to get to the dark room we're trying to
unlock
uh whatever you get for completing the
dark room we're trying to give hp to the
right unit and we failed
and they do they are called units as far
as i'm concerned no
you can't just call them units uh
they're characters they have biblical
significance ha ha
uh unconscious uh vernacular goes burr
[Laughter]
the absolute unit no i have i have seen
the new door in the depths i mean i
think
i unlocked it like maybe the first or
second day but i actually have not tried
to go through it yet
i don't know how to get through it i'm
not like super
spoiler reverse but like i i would i
wish there was like a happy medium from
like somewhere between chat just being
like oh this is what you do
and like the alternative which is like
you know me struggling to figure out
what you do for like
10 years in order to figure it out like
at some point i'm sure we're just gonna
relent
i'm not much of like a mystery guy to be
honest i'm like uh
i'm really a uh
i'm just like a mechanics guy i just
like to play the game so
i i you know i accept especially given
our truncated schedule lately like
there's no chance for me to be like the
guy who uh
you know was the first person to figure
anything out this i'm not much of a
treasure hunter honestly
much more of just uh i don't know i'm
like the guy on the ship who who
rose the oars you know hallelujah
just use dad's key yo there you had we
just get dad's key
it's the only thing that matters
i think you could do it on your own
without too much trial and error
that's good to hear okay
uh hold on let's come on d10 no thank
you
key beggar actually like insulting um
it blew up anyway so it's anemia right
like
anemic all right i saw midas touch for a
second i was a little upset we couldn't
trust the midas touch but that's okay we
still have a key but we're not going to
go alt path
i don't know that we could go alt path
and then get a couple of items and then
skirt back onto the non-alt path but
we'll figure it out
how do you feel about the peeps cross
pepsi crossover
we don't get cool sodas in vancouver in
fact well not in vancouver i should say
like
in in canada where america is like a
test market for the rest of the world i
think
everybody in the u.s they're always like
hey did you see we got new plutonium
infused uh pepsi or something like that
and i'm like all we got here is like we
just got diet
that's not true i mean we've had diet
pepsi for a long time but you know it's
the it's the principle
of the thing like you know they're
talking about uh
you know in it well hold on let me just
take a little sip
you know whenever i talk about bubbly
people are like hey have you tried
bubbly bounce it's caffeinated bubbly
hey have you tried the new like you know
coconut peach flavor of of bubbly and
i'm like dude we literally just got
like there's a billboard in vancouver
from the bubbly corporation
that says hey vancouver we got peach now
we just got the default peach we don't
even have the
we don't have any special like you know
secondary flavors yet
okay we'll pop on soos control control
space of course
everybody knows that it's control space
no i did not buy a soda stream i thought
about it though it's still on the
is still on the on the list does anybody
enchant own both an
air fryer and a soda stream
which one would you say is better
because i love the air fryer
is is the soda stream as life-changing
as the air fryer
oh i have to hit every button of course
air is better 100 okay i appreciate that
i i appreciate a non-biased look at it
i don't think that so come on the only
people who own a soda stream and an air
fryer are millionaires
did you know that uh i was looking it up
um
for for investing reasons did you know
that uh
something like 48 of american households
own
a an air fryer
i don't know if those stats are legit
that's that's crazy
control q control q
whatever shut speed down control q speed
up
lock down we don't sweat that we don't
sweat that just thinking about how i
want to approach this here
there's no way that's true i don't know
i mean like
it seems like it could be plausible to
me although that admittedly that
airfryer is a fairly recent uh invention
i think like within the past decade
at least in in the proprietary air fryer
terms we don't need to go down the air
fryer road again like
just it just makes everybody upset
myself included
i'm telling you that's i mean i guess we
are going to go down the road
i mean no no my double deal chance
i shouldn't have come to the alt path
what was i thinking man
i'll i'll reiterate what i said the last
time we talked about air fryers
which is everybody who has an air fryer
is like
i like it a lot and then people that
don't have an air fryer are like no
you can't enjoy it it's just a glorified
convection oven no
your experience is invalid because of
you know
semantic reasons or something like that
everybody who owns one is like a
certified believer and you know how we
feel about believers
getting stuck i got stuck on the
freaking rock man okay we're fine
sips thinks that microwaves are for
boomers
i mean that's because sips is a is a man
of honor
i would say microwave use is is
boomer-esque at least
you know if you're part of the
generation that that grew up on kitchen
nightmares
you know you know we we don't have any
love for chef mike here
i'm gonna do it man i want to see
something here
then what's grilling oh come on grilling
is universal
everybody loves to grill little kids
love the grill
little babies love the grill
octogenarians love to grill
everybody loves a grill
so what happens when you choose what
food to eat based on
um you know how good it tastes rather
than like what it says about you as a
person in the the discord circles you
run in
like no i can't eat off the grill um i
i eat out of a sous-vide because i have
political opinions i'm like what are you
talking about just
you can grill baby grill without uh
without being grill pilled
you know what you're absolutely right we
should go to our item room
[Laughter]
okay yeah the item room is the right way
to go why grill
saucies might win it if they do for you
mate
okay yeah that's pretty good uh let's do
it let's do it let's do it let's do it
ghost baby you know it's not a it's
certainly not an even deal there but
it is what it is why am i still subbed
to this guy
i love australia australia i love
australia
top of the morning to you
love it love it
ghost baby
no macros is from australia for sure
why cook sausages win there
to do it for you mate so good
all right so now you just you know keep
your head on a swivel we probably won't
keep the alt path going here is my take
i think we'll just try to double up on
some items
while things are somewhat easy even
though we're on you know the
great risk of death without a doubt um
and then we'll try to squeeze back onto
the other path and go to the dark room
as my guess
that's my guess for now
squeam exactly dude i don't know if
we're playing war zone tomorrow i doubt
it i don't know we might be playing
siege tomorrow
i downloaded it yesterday malph said
they needed a fifth
and then i downloaded it and by the time
it finished downloading
my man was playing isaac again i mean if
that doesn't tell you about the quality
of
repentance and i don't know what will
man
i don't know how to interact with this
room
[Laughter]
let's let's get some consumables in a
over the rest of the floor and then
we'll talk about it we'll try to figure
it out together
how did i not take a hit there oh my god
oh my god
a triple item room i'm starting to think
it might even
be a triple item
okay yeah yeah
it could be well i don't even know what
i'd be looking for at a blank rune right
now so i think we'll just okay
control space it's alges dude
that's that's pog still you know we
gotta dodge because we have to dodge
with
esau but that minimizes our chances
of of running into trouble here
just keep them as as synced as they can
get
because this would be a sick time to get
a deal with the devil
we could use a little damage injection
nice that the boss just took a couple
minutes off there
uh okay more hp belongs to
esau just be just be cool here eson's
gonna need that
no krampus i mean we gotta take mega
they probably
changed it is my guess but we gotta try
it
at least and then you hit how do you hit
q
q uses mega i think
you know what i'm willing to i'm willing
to sack
half a spirit heart for that
this is tough for me because uh
i don't know what fortune cookie does
um i don't know one bomb for five bombs
is pretty sick
you know what i'm gonna do it's good
it's good
it reads your fortune oh hi mock
here's what i'm thinking okay jedi would
not teach you this
we're just chilling just give me just
check this out the man's a genius
and two bomb synergies baby now we're
talking
that being said i'm not going to the to
the alt floor
i refuse to go to the alt floor because
that's that's not what we're doing on
this
run we don't have the damage necessary
to go to the alt
floor wait a minute the item the fortune
cookie's still in there
exqueeze me princess
okay we'll go we'll go check it
first give me that 9 volt
more curse rooms is an interesting what
an interesting dilemma and choice we
have here
um i don't have any keys anymore yeah
that's right
but then again there is a key back here
one moment please
in fact there's two keys that are easily
accessible would you look at that
you know what it happens
we'll use one more bomb to get one more
key still it's still an acceptable trade
where my believers at you pay them up
you pay em
up believers hey believers
pay you gotta give them channel points
today
you gotta give them channel points to
day
you you pay him up you pay him out
believe
you don't like that one i i came up with
a with a good one today
um it was off the top of the dome piece
when the baby was fussing in an isaac
episode
um pog i i
i said to the tune of kendrick lamar's
b-word don't kill my vibe
i am a baby who's probably going to cry
again
mom forgive me the things i don't
understand
sometimes i need to pee a lot
please don't put me down please don't
put me down
i can summon mom and dad from 10 houses
away
i got my milk i got my mobile i could
share it but today i'm saying please
don't put me down
not not no not in a veterinary sense
just in like pick up
put down pick up put down
okay hold on
okay there's a tinted rock in here
everyone just chill
of course the believer song was better
it's it was better because it's
easier the song is already called
believer
you know i'll take it i don't mind speed
up tears down
she's a certified 20 but that just ain't
me
fortune cookie reusable fortunes
what did do what do you want to do today
what do you want to do today you know
what
let's keep it rolling like i don't know
what it actually does
but let's keep it rolling temporarily
just because it's new
and we'll get rid of mega just i know i
know people are not going to be pleased
about getting rid of mega but like
it's a new item let's give it a try
question mark question mark question
mark come on we don't we use our words
here
it's like one of the things i think i've
i've made a we've instituted a wide
sweeping rule lately
um if if i say something that literally
does not make coherent sense
and people go you know what the heck is
he talking about that's a valid question
mark situation
uh-oh but if people just disagree and
they spam
10 question marks that's actually that's
just toxic you're just being mean
and you know how we feel about meanies
here i picked them up over my head
easily and then
whether they get placed down nicely or
not nicely depends on the level of
contrition that they have
from the point of lifting
hey that's just rude i mean it's comedic
timing timing comedic timing
let's go with the guarantee
trying to remember you know honestly the
boss is not that tough here
i feel like we could probably
i feel like we could probably take the
boss on this one i'm more scared of the
rooms than the boss although now that i
think about it being
jacob and esau like any dodge is really
tough to do
actually you know it's harder to be
guaranteed that you're gonna come out of
it
you know smelling like a rose mega would
be good against the boss
that's a great impression of what
somebody bad at isaac would say in order
to you know try to get to their first
win of all time
okay that's that hurts i'm dead
all right mega probably would have been
helpful there
boom roasted
all right try again what was that was
only like that was 20 minutes
that's funny you got to give comedic
timing a chance to breathe
turns out mega would have been sick
i'm not trying to blame chat necessarily
all i'm gonna say is that if i had if i
had marched the beat of my own drum
and ignored the fortune teller we
wouldn't have been in that mess in the
first place
i would just be i'd be pogging out of my
gourd
instead people were like nah you gotta
pick up the fortune teller
and then when i picked up the fortune
teller they're like you gotta put it
back down and i was like look
this is not one of those new uh fangled
uh
zoomer uh social networks where you get
to like
vote on how i live my life like this is
i much the beat of my own drum i was
born in the pre-smartphone era
i can hold my own thing when i go to the
bathroom
i'm not too worried about it
i'm not used to these eu friendly
streams
i mean we've been doing them for like
like almost more than three months now
i think you should get used to him okay
orbital does not matter
spirit heart probably doesn't matter too
much
i like my man's arms though that's
pretty cool
oh because of the time zone change that
yeah that makes sense
dude i'm very hopeful that i mean i
think that the government here said that
they were not gonna do this but i hope
that as usual they're lying
um and they actually end up like
uh making this the last year of of
daylight savings
okay hold on hold on okay you ready you
ready
bottoms up down the hatch control
control q control space
that dude unity
that one's for me though
[Laughter]
um well we can't go to the old floor so
that's one way to do it
he loves it
yeah dude like
it's crazy like
well not every year but like this
government ran on that as one of their
campaign promises
uh when they were originally elected in
2015
or 20 2017 now that i think about it um
like it's not
that major like
like daylight savings is not an enormous
policy decision like it doesn't really
dictate your quality of life but at the
same time
it's not so bad i'm like because it's
such a minor
policy decision why don't you just like
do it
[Laughter]
i don't know like that's the i was gonna
say that's the problem with democracy
but like you know what i mean
it's like if the government just had
some more executive power they could
have pushed that stuff through
like easily instead of going through all
this dialogue
then again they could probably use those
powers to push through some some stuff
that's a little less poggy
one might say on the other hand
you gotta admit things would get done
like with that
spring forward i don't think so tim
the average bureaucracy enjoyer
i know what you're talking about i
follow the memes
now it look i'm just gonna be real
i don't think blue map is like 10 out of
10 but the flip side of that
is i love knowing to some degree
where i'm going oh that's pretty sick i
love knowing to some degree where i'm
going
because uh i mean i i was doing a run
today
and and kate came into my office to pick
up the baby
i just showed her the size of the map
like it was the mausoleum
uh and it was an xl floor
and i was just boggled at the size of
the map like
i i it's it's so long as to just
make me want to end the run basically
like
it was probably like 50 rooms it was as
long as the
the void floor yeah it became became a
jrpg
i had to stop by uh you know cloud city
in order to pick up sid
runs do last way longer that's why i'm
laughing at dan
doing a one-minute poll in every item
room to to figure out what chat wants
him to take i am a fool by the way
um i'm like dude if you keep doing that
like your runs are gonna be they're
going to be uh
infinite length control q
control space hey that's good control
no look at this
balance control space control q
control space he's learning man he's
learning
look at that look at that
okay we're ready to go dude we're
actually gonna get a deal with the devil
too which is pretty sick
i hope it has something good like the
fortune cookie
yeah we got like i forget what it's
called we got
we got poop lover
[Laughter]
so uh it doesn't really matter who takes
this
oh it well it kind of matters i guess um
dirty mind thank you the average
brimstone
taker
and then also the average betrayal taker
who people have told me this item is
like a little better now
okay now i said we weren't gonna take
the alt path all right
that was before we got essentially
infinite bombs
and then also like the greatest item of
all time
brimstone which has been slightly nerfed
but
uh or maybe more than slightly nerfed
but that's okay like
i mean it's still it's still amazing
protect those rainbow poops maybe i will
maybe i won't you know
the important part is i'm trying to talk
to you guys about air fryers but you
won't
shut up okay
let's just this is an air fryer channel
now
shoop the whoop should be on let's let's
put it on non-brim marty
i i don't know what i'm doing my but the
poops are scrambling my brain
yo yum hard on the character that
actually has uh
hp as well what a happy accident
that's some good stuff
i miss when we were anti-jaywalking uh
well i'm still pretty anti-jaywalking
but i'm not anti-jaywalking because i
like hate pedestrians
i'm i'm anti-jaywalking
because i believe that society is at its
best
when everybody follows the rules
and you know what everybody's gonna do
especially when
there's like large potentially lethal
vehicles involved
so you know we got we got the system
going on with the lights
the lights do a pretty good job of
telling people uh
you know when they should go and when
they shouldn't i think that there's some
pedestrians out there who go
uh hey the light is like an inhibitor
for me
no the light is is not just trying to
keep you down
the light is also you know making sure
that you don't you have the lowest
chance possible
at least let's say to get you know hit
by a ford f-150 or a dodge ram
winner of motor trends truck of the year
a record three times in a row
what if there were no cars though yeah
what if uh
what if there were no cars what what if
god came down from heaven and just gave
everybody infinite lembus bread
you know we're we're living in a world
of realities right now
not a you know the pipe dreams of your
average discord enjoyer okay hold on
hold on
this room with two players is almost
impossible
you need to have a phd per character
oh you meant you'd you meant there's no
cars at the moment
well that's like if uh essentially
it's a perfect crime if a tree falls in
the forest and nobody's around to hear
it
the tree did not fall similarly
if you jaywalk but there's no cars it's
not jaywalking it's just called
walking genius play
oh
and this is no wonder these runs take so
long man
look at all the advantages they've given
me advantages on my legs and my arms for
you
advantages advantages advantages have
advantages you know hot hot heat
no they were pretty popular for for a
little bit
they're a canadian band
i think that this is probably the best
way to play it
okay and then we got to go get the the
the knife piece no problem
all right
you seem in a very good mood today hope
you had a have a nice
sunday it was a good uh good weekend a
good weekend
a good week and a good weekend
saved
i'm scared i don't even want to go over
it
don't go into the mirror boss excuse me
i have to get the alt path
we will go into the mirror and we will
use jacob
jacob touches it jacob touches it and
then we will immediately go back
please shoot the poops look you gotta
you gotta pick your battles right
i'm probably not gonna shoot every poop
because we got banter
we got gameplay we got two characters
simultaneously
can i ask you a question
why am i still the lost did i not go
through the mirror
it will go away
you have to kill the boss to not become
the lost you have to beat a room with
enemies in it
oh we're back we're back oh my god
that's a rule that i've never heard of
you have to defeat the
the you have to kill a room with enemies
to break the curse of the lost
that's news to me man
might be a bug you never know whatever
we we saved it
easily i might add um i just wanna
think for a second about
what i gotta do and i shouldn't
do that but i did it anyway let's do
it again get the golden chest
then in the end it was worth
the price that we paid
mom where's my
gucci sandwich you promised me
a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch
it's 11 22. that's considered
lunch in the most part of the world
sorry sometimes i just get the
it's called inspiration
i was just temporarily inspired there
you good mate is just the kind of stuff
that goes through your mind when you
realize you're gonna be playing the same
game for like four hours
is like we might as well just you know
occasionally
let's just send it man it's just like
take a lark
that's a good point i forgot about
yamaha thank you
what do you think this is control q oh
baby
oh yeah that's my triple collateral on
free-for-all
let's be real like brimstone marty is
gonna do 99 of the damage here
so we are going to give him 99 of the hp
or of the uh of the damage i should say
much to the chagrin of bernie sanders
who i might add is very upset
that 50 of the characters get 100 of the
damage upgrades
does this seem fair to you etc etc
by the way i forgot to say happy easter
everybody marry easter
an especially happy easter goes out to
all the delivery drivers out there
who place the deliveries
far enough away from my door that i
don't have to push the
the boxes over when i open the door when
i'm trying to get the boxes
a special happy easter
to those particularly astute delivery
drivers
much appreciated
you're welcome i appreciate it thank you
thank you
hey hey hey yo you stay down there
jacob touches it
we have meat cleaver and an unknown item
um i don't know what meat cleaver does
so we're gonna pick it up on brimstone
maybe it's like an enormous damage
upgrade
i have no idea
let's see let's see
it cleaves meat
gone and done it again y'all it it
turns enemies into smaller versions of
themselves much like
its namesake okay
in that case uh we'll be taking yom
heart i think and and moving on with our
lives
back at it again the krispy kreme i'm
just saying if we're talking top vines
ever
back at it again at the krispy kreme is
is up there
like it's way up there
maybe not number one but certainly it
makes it to the sweet 16.
top five no doubt
[Laughter]
x games mode x games mode is good
i do i really do like is this allowed as
well
excuse me are you are you a rock tinted
i can't tell
i ca i don't think you are i think
you're just the normal but i i
it's very hard to tell it is
you sure all right
i mean you were right but at what cost
oh gb bug is like a he's a shooter now
many battery charges okay
let me in thank you thank you just a lot
of things to like you know
pay attention to at this point on this
run
one thing and it's probably gonna happen
like when you get a little bit more
muscle memory in uh
repentance but like for now
i have not had an autopilot run
unless i've just decided that i'm going
to lose and then you can say whatever
you want because it doesn't matter
anyway but
thoughts on the band wean
i'll i'll level with you i literally
only know
ocean man and then also they had like
some songs on
chef aid the south park album
that i i listened to religiously when i
was about 10 years old
uh so i i don't think i'm the right man
for the job i guess is what i'm trying
to say get me out of here i'm
saved i'm saved i'm dead that
come on that's just mean spirited man
so you'll take this and then we'll go
we need we need some spirit hearts for
esau man
you know what there's one way to check
there was converter but i think we're i
think we're out
i think we're out
converters pog now
rotten heart this is like who cares
[Laughter]
you gave up uh three flies
okay there we go now we're talking
almond milk though at least it's not on
the brimstone character that could have
been a
that could have been a trick
i am stunned like i don't know like i i
i thought i was immune to isaac
backseating just due to like uh
the amount that i played i guess the
i've just got to acknowledge that
it's gonna happen no matter what but
like if you behave like that in like
cobalt there's invictus chad
like don't you just get banned instantly
like maybe it's time to start taking a
lesson from them
yes okay yeah see like this
like this is like the one game like i
know exactly
what i'm doing well not exactly but you
know i
i have a good understanding of what i'm
doing
it's the one game where i should be
immune to the backseating in in my
opinion
instead people are like you left behind
a rotten heart it's not even like an
extra heart it's just a couple of flies
man
okay we have a little baby situation
coming up hello baby
it's a mom situation
yeah i i recognize that from when she
was in my office for a couple hours this
morning
i do hear that she goes over and over
i do okay i see the the knock on effect
of
of what happens here she gets
distracted by chet
and
you do what you got to do nobody puts
baby in the corner though
hey baby you gotta you gotta eat for
mommy okay
hold on jacob touches it jacob touches
it
she does look like she has a gamer chair
huh
she's got her very own uh dx racer
you knew that was ah sorry i
i don't want to scare the baby but it's
kind of hard because there's some
moments of startle okay i i'm i'm very
low on hp
i i'm sure with jacob here so just chill
thank you esau for taking the hit
you know i'm glad to hear it
just go just go
okay i can't believe esau is just eating
it man go go go
i gotta get the key
it is a lot harder with jacob and esau
like this is
it's it's a bit of a task holy crap we
lived
no idea what our hp is like right now
but we did survive
at least temporarily and we got this
cool little knife now how about that
freaking sexy mom's knife man
he's doing it he's doing it this time
we'll get the rotten hard no doubt about
that
i did uh i did not see the post of on
the subreddit of well no okay i know
what you're talking about
are you talking about the post of on the
subreddit of
our baby wearing the lion merch or are
you talking about
a post that i did not see but can like
reverse engineer which is
the rapper the baby
wearing the merch which i imagine could
have been posted on a circle jerk
i don't really like you know i'm very
supportive of the memes
i don't really get the the baby meme
like i get that he's a rapper and he he
points to his head and says
let's go but i don't really understand
like
on the list of like the power rankings
of memes
is very low
i hate that you have uh a holy mantle
right now that seems scary to me
like it it's about as funny to me as
like do you know the way
or something like that like it's a very
i i give it a limited amount of uh
of my respect right now
okay we've unlocked brimstone bombs
speed does not matter although we did
get damage on
jacob so we should do that because then
we we got spun
very tricky run right now because we
don't know what our hp looks like
i think we take nothing
i hate to say it i feel like we take
nothing
yeah we need hp to open the door we
gotta
you know it's not cowardice you know
like
there's not you don't get any special
prizes for taking an item and then dying
two seconds later
i will
i will play the potato peeler one time
i will get a spirit heart on the
character most likely to die
i'll leave him i'll even buy this card
chariot see there's something there
chariot unfortunately does not work
pardon me with the door i wish it did
but it doesn't
this is handween okay don't don't step
on that then you gotta take
uh you gotta take
esau he does have some invincibility as
well
it does now i i feel like i'm being
trolled because i did that like
literally earlier today and it didn't
work
[Laughter]
i feel i feel like i'm in troll city
what howard
he's so low i thought he was the one
with the most hp
okay sorry just just stay cool here
that's very nice
i don't really mind that it's not on uh
brimstone marty we'll live with that
really just trying to stay alive
comical it's comical all right so i
think i've got the right play you know
slash marker uh alt path
failure and then we're gonna just try to
mainline the dark path i i don't think
you can do
jacob and esau alt path reliably unless
you have uh
some form of like hp and hp regeneration



all right we're gonna try uh jacob and
esau again but we're not gonna get
goaded into uh taking the
the alt path it's it's a fool's errand
you gotta do it at some point but it's
not an
it's not an all-time uh or every time
sort of thing
so now and then it's just sometimes food
mom's contact we'll put it on strong
unit for now
nl has gone off the bubbly false i was
drinking a bubbly literally was probably
what
inspired you to say he's gone off the
bubbly
was drinking this can that is bubbly
mere seconds ago
that's right it's the square path
you know where the triangle
shape goes
the triangle hole that's right
it's the square hole
you can tell i'm on the bubbly because i
got a little carbon dioxide
it has to be done
not that you've gone off it that you're
gone
off of it ah
okay
i used to this is not me this is chad i
used to date this girl who said flat
water is for poor people as she drank
her fifth
lacroix honestly it sounds like you have
kind of like
a dubious taste in women my friend i i
don't know
like i think that was supposed to be a
joke uh like
that was gonna be a dunk on
uh sparkling water consumers instead it
just calls into question you're tasting
romantic partners
it makes it makes it seem like you
should be more selective quite frankly
oh my god dude i didn't know that we had
emo modification
on the bunny ears
yeah wait did she work for the pepsi
corporation because if so
we got to get in touch okay
hp hp for you and then we take the
coward's way out we just go straight
down
it's a little uh
i mean it's more than a little rude
[Laughter]
to suggest that flat water there's a lot
of reasons you would drink flat water
you're out of sparkling water for one
you've already had too much sparkling
water
for two
those those are two big ones when you're
really thirsty you don't want to drink
sparkling water like you don't want to
go for like a uh
a long jog and then drink two liters of
lacroix like that's
that's a recipe for feeling pretty bad
in your abdomen for sure
if you want to chug something you don't
you don't chug sparkling water you savor
it
it's a bit of a slap in the face but
that's fine
i don't think i've ever had a sparkling
water i've enjoyed i think it's like
um here and this might not be the case
but this is my hunch okay this is a good
faith
uh sentiment i don't mean to try to own
somebody
i feel like if your main comparison
is sparkling water to either
juice or soda
sparkling water can't compete with the
sweetness no doubt
if your comparison is sparkling water to
to flat water then i think it's a lot
easier to appreciate
but i don't think that's that's the
truth for everybody
i like them both you know i mean that
you're i'm getting pushed like and this
is the danger i think you know we end up
in society when we disagree we end up
being so polarized now you know
like you can't just be like i prefer
this i don't like this instead it's got
to be like anybody who like the average
sparkling water enjoyer etc etc like
like
exactly what i've done um i like them
both don't get me wrong
like this
i'm just like it's the same as the air
fryer i'm like i don't know why
you know if i was like hey you shouldn't
smoke people would be like hey man let
people live
their lives times are tough blah blah
blah um
you know you don't know what i've been
through if you're like i'm enjoying a
can of sparkling water people are like
it tastes like
uh it tastes like the shavings from an
electric razor
it tastes like i'm drinking like a
copper wire
it's like they they they've shorted the
sparkling water stocks or something we
got a bunch of melvin capitals
i don't know it's just it's the same as
the air fryer
you could i had the best crispy chicken
wings in the air fryer last night people
will be in chat like
now you didn't i don't understand it man
okay just just hang back just hang back
no i've never had a white claw post
pandemic if i get invited to like
somebody's barbecue or something
i think i would try one for sure i mean
it's hard seltzer right
i bet i would probably enjoy it
i'm not gonna go to the curse room just
take me down here
it's very good is good i love them
they're pretty good
i mean that's the thing i i don't i mean
maybe it's hard to say
like i can't say that i anything popular
can't be bad but like i feel like
white claw and like neutral vodka soda
and stuff like that up here they've sold
so
much in such a short frame frame of time
is that even a time frame such a short
span of time there we go
that i'm like there's gotta be something
to it
like i mean bud light lime was really
popular as well i think it's like a
trash
uh beer for sure but like when i had my
first bud light lime i was like i can
totally understand why people
you know drink this it tastes like a
tortilla chip
okay i'd give it a shot for sure
pbr is better i mean so you know at that
point we're like really would you rather
like you know
you know lick the lid of the trash can
or like lick someone's pocket limp or
something like that
you know there's do it's different
strokes for different folks
if you're at a barbecue you know you're
in the hot summer sun or something like
that
no no reason to get picky
you're gonna show up to like the fourth
of july barbecue with a bunch of like
nitro milk stouts and stuff like that
a 30 rack of pliny the elder and be like
hey you guys want to have like
one and a half triple ipas and then fall
asleep
no man i want to like stay coherent and
like you know talk to my aunt about her
like mlm business or something like that
you know
it's it's called family sweetheart la
familia
does it matter i think
it's about la familia
i'm just hopeful we get like a half of
the goodness that we had on our last run
that's what's burning me up like a jonas
brothers song if we had just done
the like if we if we held our hubris in
check we would have won the last run on
the dark path easily
i think i did ask for half the items
and would you look at that
no i don't think there's any way to
start uh an mlm
in king of retail but i wouldn't be
surprised so there's this company and
and i don't even mean it in a negative
way
they literally release um
like a game a week and they're called
playway
it's a it's a polish publisher on steam
uh
they release every simulator game you've
ever seen cooking simulator car mechanic
simulator
you know blah blah blah mech mechanic
simulator they make them all
um i wouldn't be surprised if
if play way comes out with like an mlm
simulator
within i would say 18 months
like they're just the right company for
it i think they produce these games
in record time and then you know
i mean i wouldn't call it shovelware
because like some of them are
are actually like pretty good okay i
i don't think we could take this i don't
even know who i've given hp to at this
point but it is what it is
um no not because like mlms are a thing
in poland but like
uh just because like they have
every other simulator including some
like you know
dubious ones you know like cartel
simulator
you know drug dealer simulator etc etc
i'm waiting for twitch streamer
simulator it's been out for like
for years
yeah they made a house flipper they also
made the tenants i think i think the
tenants is a playway joint
there's a huge degree of variety right
like
in in the in the quality of the the
games but
yeah like polish simulators i feel like
it's mostly just play away but
polish simulators are like we're gonna
you know you you wanna
be a man who lives in a bunker we'll
make that game for you in three months
german simulators are like oh you wanna
like you know drive a bus
talk to us in eight years we're working
on it
two different strokes for different
folks
take me down here
they're not all garbage no like some of
them are not very good
i'll just be honest in fact i would
probably say
most of them the the main reason you
would play
is just for uh like maybe you for
whatever reason you've always wanted to
be like
i've always wanted to run a cotton candy
stand or something like that
um but i think that
some of them end up being pretty good
cooking simulator was
i mean house flipper people love um
cooking simulator
uh was a lot of fun
tenants seems pretty good i've i've got
a couple of
i've started using the oh geez
started using the wishlist feature on
steam i have a lot of
uh playway stuff on my wishlist not
joking because it's stuff that i think
would be great for stream
like i think there's one coming out
called like you are the lawyer or
something like that
and i was like i gotta try that when it
comes out that's gonna be like
that's gonna be a dream come true
okay
oh don't even get me started on on
fighting not fighting
farming simulator but really isn't
farming just fighting
um hunger
if you if you really think about it
can we talk about how much tenant sucked
uh no because i haven't seen it yet i'm
still waiting for it to come out in a
free context because everybody told me
it was not worth paying for
[Laughter]
they have a pope game coming out let's
go
it's not bad it's just not good i'll
give it a try i mean like
at this point i i really i just can't
pay for a movie
i have amazon prime disney plus and
netflix like
if i ever pay for a movie like i'm
running a deficit
that's true i have hbo as well dude like
i literally like if i ever pay for a
movie it cost me like
200
by the way and and i know i talked about
this on
on friday i actually did finally
finish an episode of marriage or
mortgage on netflix
the show where uh couples have a budget
and then they pit
a wedding planner against a real estate
agent
to see whether they'll they'll rather
have their dream wedding or move into a
house
um and i have to tell you it's actually
like
accidentally one of the funniest shows
of all time
because in the first episode it's like
you know almost an hour
long and they go through uh you know
like
planning the wedding and stuff like that
and then you know this is what you'll
get on your budget for this wedding and
they're like oh it's a dream come true
and then the uh for the house one they
were like
you know oh we found like this awesome
place and you know there's like a lot of
production went into it a ton of budget
etc etc
and then uh at the end of the episode
they're like we've chosen the dream
wedding
and then instantly like the camera
you know fades to black and then text
pops up on the screen that's like
due to covet 19 they were not able to
have their dream wedding anyway
so and i'm not laughing at the
couples it's just a funny situation
where like
they still i guess they'd put like a
deposit in on some of the stuff so they
rented like
like two trolleys that were gonna carry
80 people from the reception
or from the ceremony to the reception to
the blah blah
and then they were only able to have
like their parents there so like they
were like my mom and dad really loved
the private trolley that they got and i
was like oh
this just that's just tough
you hate to see it and then i was also
thinking and this is like
not the angle that obviously anybody
wants to
tackle it from but i was also like man
you know not only did your wedding get
screwed up but
uh like home prices rose so much you
probably cost yourself like
20 extra uh when you do eventually
choose to buy into the market like you
got
i feel bad for you you really just got
like insanely screwed
is what it comes down to
sucks pretty bad do you think you get
your money's worth out of those
subscriptions uh well here's the thing
for a long time netflix was like a
no-brainer
and maybe we should have done esau there
but um netflix was a no-brainer for a
long time
now lately i have not gotten my money's
worth out of netflix but i'm you know
i mean just being honest like i'm i'm
not gonna cancel it because like i just
enjoy being able to have it up and
eventually i have faith some netflix
original will come out that i'll be
happy to have um
disney plus i've been getting more than
my money's worth
recently not just the the marvel stuff
but also like i watched big trouble in
little china yesterday like they they've
got a
if you think it's just marvel stuff
they've got a pretty huge
lineup of uh of uh
shows and movies from you know the the
three trillion businesses that dizzy
has uh has acquired over the course of
the past few years
um amazon prime video like literally we
just have it because of
amazon prime so i'm not really too
worried about that one either way we're
getting our money's worth out of that
yeah that's true they do it disney plus
has the simpsons on it
how about that and then hbo
hbo varies but i do like my the first
place i look when i turn on my tv in the
afternoon
is uh is the movie channels
but unfortunately i know how this sounds
but i think we kind of get screwed uh
in canada on hbo and the movie channels
due to
the can con law where you have to play
like
uh you know 10 canadian content or
something like that i don't exactly know
how it applies
but i feel like crave which is like our
hbo analog
does so many like bad canadian movies
it sucks i wish that they were better
so they didn't have to sell out my my
country
and there are some good canadian films
you know guy madden makes some good
stuff
technically i suppose the resident evil
films are uh
are canadian as well
we're not doing all path but like it's
it's just like
i got hbo i want them to play
good stuff but instead like it's some
canadian student film like 70
of the time i'm like this isn't worth 20
bucks a month
they just put the nanny on hbo mr
sheffield
sorry
but that i i can't believe i remember
what the name of the
the family from the nanny was dude
that's scaring me
i had no clue that that knowledge was up
there
it's such a such a strange comment that
also made me laugh
this is from chat um
i'd have given fran drescher a baby you
know just uh
so kind of the fran like it they mean it
as a joke if you're watching don't
don't read that and and get creeped out
even though it is creepy
[Laughter]
i promise you they mean it as a
compliment okay it's it's hard to tell
in the moment but
i love the hassan emo like what is it
it's always like okay so here's what i
know about hassan right
he's a political streamer who also plays
a lot of
grand theft auto i'm in his chat on
occasion and it's a lot of fun because i
believe
i've been made a vip and his chat is in
emote only like 25
of the time so sometimes i just come in
there
and like just flex the fact that i can
talk which is a lot of fun
everybody else is just spamming emotes
and i'm i'm able to type things
that's that's a good time okay
definitely do not go there
um then i also
occasionally on twitter i will see that
hassan has liked the tweet that could be
described by the younger generation as
being a thirst
trap okay don't take any dumb damage
here
uh and then anytime that happens
the replies to the tweet are just
hundreds of people
using that has mods emote
oh no dude
so that's that's literally like i don't
i i've diagnosed enough to know what i'm
looking at
but i don't understand the the
implications of it
what is a thirst trap again this is like
secondhand knowledge my understanding of
a thirst trap
is when basically somebody posts uh
a freaking sexy selfie
designed to attract compliments and
thirst i.e uh sexual attraction
that's the way i understand it at least
okay you you don't have an orbital jacob
jacob touches it
that's what shibley told me anyway
does this have anything to do with down
bad yeah i don't know i think
down bad is like um and again this is
just from
what i can infer i believe that down
bad is a is a synonym for being horny
but but it also has like an air of it's
not just like you're a horn dog it's
that you're also like desperate
like you're horny and lonely
[Laughter]
or something along those lines am i am i
doing okay by the
zoomer social media terminology right
now
i'd say so let's go the baby let's go
every card in this game is the tower
just for the record
really leaning into the boomer energy
just like just shut up
it's just like a
anime meme of guy looking at butterfly
uh
you know referencing anything that
happened before the year 2018
is this a boomer
oh my god we've made it to the door
okay sneak in you will not hit me
i told you i told you i told you
it's a simple question are you supposed
to be able to dodge is this character
no okay fair enough that's all i could
ask
hold on hold on yeah yeah yeah
check this out check this out
he's so good officially he's so good
sometimes you just gotta use your brain
okay try again i'll take it i'll tell
you no no as you jacob doesn't touch it
oh he's so close to the edge dude
i'm so like literally just walked over
it
i after this i got to do like a a cane
run man like my brain is so freaking
destroyed
he uses i i'm gonna say it uses
30 more calories
to play as jacob and esau do blue fires
suck
now i mean i think much like a lot of
things in this game
they've been nerfed a little bit for
sure
or a lot maybe
it's a good idea chad wait what
wait what um
do we care for this i don't know book of
sin could keep us alive
eric i'm i'm begging you man just chill
out just just relax
i think i'm happy with book of sin
keeping us alive here
i don't know this is this is the time to
commit it's the time to use a a little
bit more energy
hopefully set ourselves up reasonably
well for the rest of the game because
this run could only be like halfway over
oh man okay
um it's not it's not that impressive but
oh you know what that's a good point you
could probably hit two skulls
simultaneously while gambling now i
didn't even consider that
apparently it's a 10 chance for uh
for the blue fires to pay out now i
wanna play the demon judgment but i
think we gotta just like
get hit because we have no control over
that um but i think we gotta
uh get some red hearts first like hp is
very precious here
as it always is yeah this this would be
the last jacob and he saw
i also did one this morning so i'm like
i'm getting a little burned out on this
but
we'll play as a an easier character next
time yeah
hold on i'll try to use get out of jail
on the door as well
it's all in the interest of testing
you're the door you're the door are you
the door
this is bethany
you're the door get out of jail free
it made a key sound it did not open
cross that off the list
one more data point
alt path keeper run you know we may not
just chill out for a minute all right we
got uh
something something billion dollar
stakes single byte are these
these are rocket shots right
i haven't played as the keeper since the
the changes so i actually should because
he's got three hp now and like i think
deals with the devil are uh
you can spend money on them instead of
spending hp like i feel like he's pretty
sick now maybe
maybe we will just you know win first
try as the keeper
every time i've had this item i've
accidentally killed myself
well you know we could use a
an excuse maybe it would be for the best
so i'm not sure if this runs got the
legs i need right now
why not just do it just yeah what's the
worst that could happen
okay just so we're looking for more
curse rooms
hmm
tinted skull was there a tinted skull
there was a tinted skull okay
now i understand all right
you're right it is a little spicy
um when you use bombs just stand still
but i'm like i okay hold on
it what
i don't know what's happening
put me in i'm ready we went to
everything
don't walk in the mom
that's one by the way so this is maybe
this is not becoming of a streamer
but i saw literally like the same people
who were like i'm not gonna spoil
anything
we're like for the first time ever they
were like don't forget the full card
wink wink don't forget the full card
he doesn't know lol forehead and i said
you know what
we will uh we'll hold that for a future
video then
i feel like that's an ill-gotten game
okay keep it moving he doesn't know hey
for no reason whatsoever would you
consider
taking the full card here
we're gonna do some new stuff you know
we got to do it as jacob and esau i'm
sure at some point anyway but
this run just getting like the slightest
bit of actual momentum would help out a
lot
getting some positive feelings
i feel like this run is kind of a
doo-doo but on the bright side we do
have a 1 in 250 chance of getting a deal
with the devil
that could really spin it around here
never tell me the odds
i want you to get it who gets what
doesn't matter
but we might as well take both because
we want to go
dark path probably yeah okay i think we
want to go dark path
yeah yeah yeah
help did they fix kerstein i've had
cursed eye a couple times
i mean i feel like this adds a little
too much chaos into this run but
i mean i just want just trying to coast
till the end i'll probably walk into it
uh
by accident anyway it's buffed but it
still sucks
yeah i still don't get curse of the
tower either like curse of the tower
i don't know if it's just the meme or
there's some meat and potatoes to it but
people are like it's better now
doesn't it do the exact same thing
i've i've never noticed obama's home on
enemies now
control q please thank you
that changes everything man oh no
and they do a lot more damage
it's still bad for the player but it's
better at killing enemies
i mean it's something but
still not worth taking i'm trying really
hard not to just slip into the chat
trap of like anytime anything is buffed
it must be good now and anytime
anything's nerfed it must be bad now
i've been seeing that a lot
pop up please pop up please i'd like to
i'd like to hit you and not be killed
can i
could you pop up please
i'm dead it's it's impossible it's a
hell room
well slash marker next



back at it again at the krispy kreme um
didn't the divergent movies die like
they uh
they were gonna make like
three of them and then the first one did
so badly they didn't even make the
second
something like that
they turned it into a tv movie
hold r you've been watching too many
other streamers honestly
you need to insulate yourselves you know
like
for the difficult lives that lie ahead
of you if you face strife
you know you can't hold our irl
you gotta you gotta pull yourself out
you know if a mouse gets stuck in a
bucket of cream
you can either drown or you can
move your little legs so fast you turn
the butter into cream and climb out
exactly one bite at a time
i know that that's a it's a catch me if
you can quote but i don't know it from
catch me if you can i know it from mouth
quoting uh catch me if you can
catch me if you can was about me i don't
think so
i don't think your name is frank
abagnale or whoever tom hanks played in
that movie
what do you say when you get a strike in
bowling
is this is there a real punch line to
this one i don't know
who you could say who do you think you
are i am usually like
it's such a common occurrence for me
that i try not to draw too much
attention to it
i just go like like a nice little fist
pump you know
no i do not say st reich that's
classless
that'll get you kicked out of the lucky
lanes
no no no
have you ever injured yourself while
bowling you get a bruise on your ankle
sometimes that's about it
like or you maybe sometimes like your
thumb gets a little
jammed when you're when it comes out of
the ball
but you get it like an ankle bruise like
depending on the way that your
uh your gait is in advance of your shot
oh come on
you hit the ball against your ankle as
you release and you get a little bruise
there
it happens who does that
i'm i mean like you're asking the
authority then when the authorities like
this what
happens you're like based on my
inexperience i doubt it
i play i was in a bowling league because
i i was like
mr popular uh as a as a small child as
an adolescent i played in a bowling
league
people are bruising their their ankles
left right and center
deep lord what was your average i can't
remember honestly but like i think my
highest
bold game ever was like a 2 220
something or 230 something
never even came close to sniffing at a
uh
at a perfect game but had some some
solid ones for sure
don't don't explode into you're creating
too much i can't get out of the way
have you ever crapped in a bowling alley
bathroom
it's kind of a personal question um
you know it might sound ridiculous
considering i
you knew that was coming considering i
played in a league
but i honestly think the answer is
probably no
it's not possible man like um
it's uh i i really i wouldn't say i had
like a complex about it
but uh i really endeavored not to be
like a
a public uh pooper
i mean in in 10 years of school from
like junior kindergarten to eighth grade
i think i probably did a number two in
the school bathroom like
i would say less than ten times it was
definitely like less than once a year
it was only if there was like some kind
of emergency that i would
that i would do it otherwise i would i
would just hold it until i got home
i wonder if this will give us a deal
with the devil that's the keeper style
because we used it on this floor
could be interesting i did it like twice
from first to 12th grade i mean that's
i'm impressed honestly i i'm we had
different gut bacteria i guess
every once in a while i just found
myself in a position where there was no
choice
i do remember though like once i uh
in second grade i put up my hand to ask
to go to the bathroom
and then the teacher was like yes ryan
and i was like can i go take a poop
and she was like you don't have to say
that you can just say
may i go to the bathroom please
[Laughter]
it was a pretty good own in in my
opinion
one of the better owns oh at work i
i would poop as often as i could get
away with i mean it it sucks actually
like
okay oh stonks
legitimate stocks um
it sucks because like as a when i worked
in an
office you could absolutely
just poop you could probably take two
mid-length poops daily without anybody
even
noticing you know like you could take
you could you could poop 15 minutes a
day
nobody would would notice um
in fact they're probably happy to see
you gone let's let's save our
uh money to spend on a deal with the
devil on the next floor
seems very sensible to me um but when i
worked as a teacher
literally you just had to do like you
know you had six minutes between classes
and you had to share a bathroom
uh with the kids which was demoralizing
man
because they had like one adult stall
and then like one
kid's stall sometimes you'd end up
pooping
like next to your students and they'd be
like trying to have a conversation with
you on the toilet and you're like
like kevin i really didn't want you to
know that like your teacher's
poo smelled this bad like this is too
familiar
and like oh hold on i think i got a yeah
a headphone based issue
yeah it's messed up man like it's a bad
system
and then sometimes like the the really
young kids
you know they were like five years old
so their bathroom habits weren't that
good
they would like open the door while they
were pooping and be like can you help me
and of course you're gonna you're like
you know it's not in my job description
but you're like yeah what do you need
buddy but you're like
you know i don't get paid enough to like
have to
deal with this kid's toilet problems
there was also they they had like
support staff at the school that was
sometimes you'd be like uh
hannah teacher hannah teacher kevin has
a real problem going on here
yeah but then if you could hold it until
you got home that was the sweetest poop
didn't have to deal with any of that
nonsense
oh there were a lot of cabins kevin very
common like
esl name
yikes that is not what you're looking
for
how much did it cost to rent in south
korea that is uh is
it's an industry secret i
well it depends at least like my my
information is like outdated now right
like because this was 10 years ago uh
but
help me uh we the the school that i
worked at
gave you housing but it was like as
leverage to give you a smaller salary so
they they paid for your rent
but in return you made like
you know less money which is like
almost kind of like i mean criminal
i think but uh because i also think that
they happen to own the building which is
you know let's just put it this way like
when you're going into this job
like you know you're you're not going in
because you're like this is like a
you know an awesome career you're like i
don't know what i'm gonna do
after college so like let's just have
kind of like a year of
traveling that is also working and might
generate i'm dead
i'm alive might generate like some a
little extra cash you know
got him okay
i don't know i feel like bad phd could
be fun obviously we don't care about
book of belial
so this should be flies i think
i don't know maybe i don't know what i'm
talking about it's an interesting item
at least
zayn alert
big summer blowout i do like bad phd i
think it's
oh no
well it's still kind of stuck ah okay
whatever just let me out man
rude do i have a bomb i do have a bomb
were you able to accumulate money given
the salary
yeah i mean like straight up uh i mean i
i don't mind being open about it like
i think my my salary when i worked in
korea ended up being about
1700 bucks a month u.s which is
like pretty not good and you're working
a lot and you're working with kids which
usually you know you would hope had like
a little premium attached to it
um but they do
pay for your rents
so that cuts you could consider that
that maybe saves you like 30 percent
um
but for most people and and you don't
really pay tax on it either like
you end up being in the lowest income
bracket
and there's like a tax treaty between
south korea
and and canada and the us where like
you know you pay tax monthly but then
you get like a huge refund when you
leave
and then you pay tax in your home
country but
uh yeah it's it's not exactly like the
kind of salary where you're like i'm
gonna
be happy about dealing with a lot of bs
but most people do end up saving a lot
of money
you know food is cheap like just the
standard of living or the cost of living
is pretty cheap in south korea or at
least it was then
let's see what this does birthright does
something different is every character
right
i don't know so a lot of people like um
used it they did it for a couple of
years to like pay off
as much student loan debt as possible
that's more than i get for my phd
stipend
yo but that's like yo like you
but you're getting it like a phd
i was getting i don't i have nothing to
show for my
time there
you you're getting like uh well hold on
i didn't mean to all tab there but
you're kind of coming out uh on the
other side
you're you're gonna end up being the
person that
like sends the s downhill right
like once you got the phd
five years later you you've got like a
phd candidate working under you for
peanuts or something
that's the way i understand it at least
not really that's true i don't really
know what i'm talking about
what do you do and and this is not meant
to be negative at all
sincerely what do you do with a phd like
with an undergrad
you can't do anything for most look okay
there's some exceptions all right
computer science engineering et cetera
et cetera
with a masters you can do anything right
but then with a phd aren't you kind of
like gated into just becoming a
a professor
i i thought it was like the phd is just
like the it's the track into
professional academia not at all
as long as it beats me man
you see that dodge
when i went this is a true story i was a
good student in high school
when i went to university i had no idea
what the difference between a bachelor's
and a master's degree was
i honestly thought that uh
at first like i figured it out
eventually but
at first i thought that like a
bachelor's is what you get
like if you just get your degree but
don't do that well and then a phd or a
master's is what you get when you
do really well in school i thought it
was like the same time
investment but it was like the it's
based on how well you did
obviously that's not the case
i wish
having a phd would be pretty sick though
i would definitely
be one of those no i wouldn't but i'll
say that i am for the joke
i would list myself as a doctor even if
you know if my phd was not an md i would
still list myself as a doctor
100
that's dr lyon
you should though yeah but like you know
it's not you when they go like is there
a doctor on the plane they're not like
uh we needed uh please i uh yes okay i'm
uh
this is dr lyon um oh
help me this man collapsed on the plane
he doesn't know where he is and we don't
know what's wrong with him
all right um what's your favorite of
sophocles uh greek classics
sir what do you think about uh clinton
astra
oh yes i'm a doctor of uh of the
classics at the
university of phoenix online
there is a good bid there absolutely if
you were like
you know is there a doctor on board this
man's sick
okay tell me about your mother you know
they're like
they're a you know they're like a
psychiatrist or whatever
that'd be pretty funny that'd be a
pretty good joke
you're pretty good it's probably been
done right it's probably been done
i don't hate it i'll tease i don't even
know who clintum nestra is
she's she's from one of those she from
like saturnalia or
something like that
wait do i need two bombs am i stupid i'm
stupid
okay let's find we'll just get one here
anyway hold on
there's a stats up ah
ah it's agamemnon's wife that's right
bad trip gives us flies okay amnesia
let's not take it yet experimental pill
i don't know man
i'll take it lock down damage up speed
down damage up okay we let's not get too
ahead of ourselves but our damage is
looking pretty sick
0.66 speed is a little on the low side
do i have a bomb i do poggy
you know we could do two but no we need
those bombs that's right
[Laughter]
i was like we could get pandora's box to
give us
uh a speed upgrade
possibly what music have you been
listening to lately
uh it's a little known album called uh
the rational reminder podcast
uh discussions about five factor
portfolio management
starring ben felix and cameron passmore
analyst at pwl capital
you're absolutely right i should have i
should have taken this pill
that's my bad i i do like that there was
one person in
in the sea of resident sleepers that
said pog
i appreciate that thank you thank you
for your pogs
i appreciate it that's all i got i'll
just repeat it again a couple more times
i want to do this i don't really want to
do this
and now if you had to do any
professional job what would you choose
you didn't put within reason so i'm
gonna say ceo uh
i'm gonna say nhl all-star
no baseball but i want to be a
designated hitter
that's what do you think is the best
sport
if we're talking about maximum money
versus like money versus work but also
putting in
a little injury factor as well i kind of
believed in golf for the record until i
watched that tiger woods documentary and
found out that he like
absolutely destroyed his back somehow
like
i was like i i look i get that he's a
world-class
athlete but while i was watching the
documentary i was like bro how did you
screw up your back so bad
it's golf it's not you know you're in
the middle of golfing and like stone
cold steve austin comes over and throws
you through a folding
chair or something like that like
i'm like how'd you mess up your back so
bad in a sport that like
70 year olds play just because it gives
them the best chance to stay active
all right because i forgot he was uh he
trained to be a navy seal that's right i
actually genuinely just forgot about
that part where he
and yeah in the documentary they were
like and the navy seals would just like
kick the crap out
it's not funny but just
just just a little weird for sure just a
little strange
yeah there was a period where tiger
woods was like i'm gonna be a navy seal
i'm mad yes yes no please
i'm begging don't explode on that just
hit the boss dude thank you
you're the only thing i got that does
damage
natural seal progression or natural
career
profession golfer to navy seal no
here's you know what he did he did
golfer
to navy seal to golfer
he went uh he went back and forth like
like michael jordan
okay i mean this could be super valuable
look if i get a penny i'll probably buy
it we got keys
golden chests are good value we'd like
to become guppy we gotta give it a try
let's keep exploring i mean like we're
in this for the long haul
it's a heck of a trip i'm not taking the
pillow i'll take the pill when i leave
it's three flies everyone just freaking
chill out
all right we're we're staring down the
barrel right now
of possibly not getting a single win
today
we are doing like some of the i mean
obviously like the hardest challenges
but
also it's just kind of like it's a hard
game sneaks up on you
birthright makes wooden nickel
guaranteed to drop a coin
really i thought we didn't get a coin
drop when we started on the boss
but i might be a mistake it seems like
it's doing some crazy good
work for us on the percentages here okay
that just i didn't think my speed was
uh that bad but it is
i don't want to spend too much here
blow him up blow him up
money not funny
this is so risky but we're out here
okay i just gotta bake it into my brain
all right the right path to take
right right up and then all the way to
the left
oh baby right
right up
milk the blood bank
it's actually like a really good idea
at first i was like where did the coins
come from genius and then i was like ah
the blood bank oh yeah but as the keeper
the blood bank is not guaranteed to pay
out with coins
or at least it wasn't um
yeah where are the coins coming from
genius
i'm gonna take you to the bank senator
trent
to the blood bank
it's from a steven seagal movie i can't
remember what it's i
all i remember is it's not under siege
can i also tell you something
how the heck are we going to get into
the
special path here it's it's going to be
a challenge i'll tell you that
i guess we just uh
do it forehead just be built different
do you think hard mode is more difficult
now or am i just rusty
uh it's it's a lot more difficult now
i mean like empirically not not just
because there's new enemies but like
genuinely like that there have been
mathematical nerfs
the most deadly of all nerfs
it's easier to path with flight maybe
get the bible
it you know it's one of those things
where i i'm gonna choose to keep the
item that it gives the
okay that's a little what i was gonna
say is i'm gonna keep the item that
gives the keeper a chance to win
uh the wooden nickel but my brain does
that from time to time as well
it forgets about the fact that wooden
nickel is basically essential
and instead just goes like oh my god
it's so loud
let me in instead just goes like ah you
know what maybe we could try to take
something else
okay smart fly turns us into be alzab
look at that
now we got uh we got it all figured out
flying is good speed is grand
okay i need your help chat what on earth
is golden thing
members card pog what
okay what does it do no see in this in
this business i don't say take it
must buy i describe its effect to me
please
it gives you an extra shop in the shop
makes shop pog expensive
extra shop floor
okay so if i'm it unlocks the costco
floor
i don't know what this means makes it
you get a black market
every shop what okay
you know i i think it's one of those
things i'm just gonna have to pick up
and then
all right all right okay
let me see what's going on here we just
take it then you understand
so none of these do anything for us
really um but it's good to know like i
don't think the miter is gonna be good
as the keeper
i'll spend seven cents for there's
option
or there's options because being able to
choose our item from the boss is worth a
lot
like i think we got a good thing going
here
still very tough to win but
certainly like i'm looking at my dps i'm
feeling good
i'm looking at my hp i'm feeling close
to as good as you can
and now we got some some extra
opportunities less damage we take the
more money we get
from wood and nickel
the more money we get from wooden nickel
the more likely we'll be able to take
deals with the devil in the future
that's good stuff the more likely we'll
be able to make that bonus shop work for
us
i don't know why we're charming enemies
so frequently either
but i'm i'm not against it is that what
mulligan does now
oh beauzeba bialzebub of course
i knew that i was just testing to see if
you did
we oh cause we can fly dummy um
you know as the keeper there's a case to
be made that this might not be so bad
but i don't think i can do it just yet
i don't think i can do it just yet we
gotta think about it
the bonus shop also pulls from all pools
oh baby
you do have black candle yeah but i'm
trying to think about like what the the
positive
like like what's the point of taking
cursed eye
there's got to be more of a point than
just you can take it with no downside
like there has to be an upside
because we have to go back into the room
now especially higher dps
i i in zoomer terms i say cap to that
though i don't know do you think it
do you think it's meaningfully higher
dps i'm skeptical i think i gotta march
to the beat of my own drum
if i'm gonna lose i'd i'd rather lose on
my own uh
on my own merits here i mean so we have
to do this
that's just a given
really wanted that to pay out and then
yo placenta's pretty sick i feel like
the
bone heart doesn't do anything for us
so i think we but experimental treatment
is so spicy if we lose hp
so i think we have to take the marrow oh
he just gave us some flies
and i'll tell you i'm going to go to the
bathroom really quick this run is a
chance
i'm not going to run ads but follow me
we're at
very neat we're 11 followers away from
412.
i apologize to the youtube audience but
you got to go you got to go
click the follow button and i won't run
ants see you in a moment
all right youtube call off the dogs
call off the dogs we're back
bubbly in tow
ooh upside down frank or z
what a world
what flavor is that oh that's the peach
bubbly thank you for asking
ooh
i forgot what i was doing we have to hit
all the buttons we have to go to the
the super realm yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
i remember now
you were about to take cursed eye nice
try 10 out of 10
bait mates
so we should we won't be able to fly
when we do this unfortunately
but that's okay it is what it is
this is like a tomah you'd like to come
in huh okay come on
don't go in the baby playpen either
that's not for cats
como he's getting in the chords you you
freaking get in the box okay he got in
the box
no cats allowed
yeah i'm trying to bring back trollololo
i think it's a pretty good meme a top
tier meme
how much pizza is socially acceptable to
eat at a party
well you never take a second well it
depends on the size
if it's reasonable that hurts
that hurts so much more i'm going to die
goodbye
if the size of the party
is reasonable to remember everybody's
consumption
chill chill
then you don't take a second piece until
everybody else has taken their first
piece
i knew it i was like i can't get out of
the way of the freaking fly man
ah
here we go again um yeah you don't take
your second piece until somebody else
has taken their uh
until everybody else has finished their
first piece
if you're in a situation where like
there's some
maybe like a pizza party for example i
don't know i think the idea of the host
is that you kind of eat to your heart's
content
i mean like what you shouldn't do i
guess
is is treat it as if it's like
you know like if you're at the pizza
party you should remember you're not
at the party to just eat as much pizza
as possible
like it's so everybody can have a fun
time
like many things in life i don't think
there's like a hard and fast rule that
i mean the easy answer is like don't be
a weirdo about it or you won't get
invited back i guess
that's the easy answer the more
complicated answer i don't know
you know did if you if you have to ask
you should probably slow down is the
answer
[Laughter]
and don't even get me started about the
about the
crust situation you know if you're if
you're eating a slice
and then you throw your crust away and
then you'd go for a second slice right
away because you're done with the first
one
you got to bake in like at least another
30 to
90 seconds for everybody to finish their
crust before you start the next round
don't be the person who like you know
is 50 of the way through the their slice
of pizza and then grabs another one to
put on their plate just so that nobody
else can have it that's too much
it's simply too much
is it socially acceptable to ask to eat
other people's crusts
i mean you can i think if it's a close
friend or like
a spouse you can ask if it's someone you
basically just met
or have like a business relationship
with absolutely not
it truly it would be an unbelievable
faux pas
that's interesting let me think about
that for a second
um i'm gonna think about it a little
longer
you know what no i'm not we're just
gonna take chaos because in my head i
was milling it about and i was like well
we don't really need to get
chaos because we can get deals from
anything now um
you know we can just pay for deals with
our money like we're not going to get
gated out of the devil deal pool so the
the use case for chaos is a little lower
and then in my head i just went you know
what like don't be a baby like
just just take it every other win like
i've ever gotten on a difficult
challenge in isaac is essentially just
come from
go you know going my own way
why not take the ladder i want to save
the money for deals with the devil on
the next floor i consider the latter
a low yield item
but high heats no not really still still
pretty low you
all right that's unfortunate
but it is what it is moving on
now that's good stuff
yeah i use dad's key to try to find the
second secret room
oh like literally like you know you just
got to pick your battles in chat like
anybody that's like you should take it
over wooden penny you can just discount
they don't know what they're talking
about like they honestly they've
probably never beaten mama's isaac much
less like
you know the hush is the keeper
you basic there's probably some
situations
like you could concoct them you can
concoct any situation to support your
point in this game though that's so good
um but uh
99 percent of the time holding onto
wooden nickels gonna be the right
decision
and like a hundred percent of the time
it's gonna be a pretty good decision
rarely are you gonna encounter one where
you're like oh i
screwed myself by by holding on to this
amazing item
okay metronome is pretty bad we don't
need bombs immediately let's move along
here save your money for a deal with the
devil
this yeah i don't want to jinx it i do
kind of wish i had some bombs now
admittedly but i'm glad we got money
so if we do things right
don't don't spin over here if we do
things right
we should have a pretty good chance to
have a deal with the devil
although now that i think you know what
i'm i was about to get hit instead i
didn't because i'm built different um i
don't think a deal with the devil is
that strong though because it's gonna
have
uh items from any pool so it's possible
that it's not gonna be worth anything
but now hold on that's that's the new d
infinity
i think that's actually not good
unfortunately any other character i
would probably consider it
but uh as the keeper i don't think you
can do it
i think you gotta stick with that wooden
nickel
any other character you do it
yo new infinity you can pick what dice
you use that's pretty sick
i still don't know what uh which one i
would use though
i'm like uh
i i'm happy with where we stand d6 if
you use a d6 though you re-roll your
your wooden nickel
shouldn't have picked it up
the nickel is the keeper is insanely
good like i'm
surprised that how like i mean we've
been through this before but i guess a
lot of people weren't around like
for for some of the later like
afterbirth plus episodes on youtube
we don't really do zayn for zayn's sake
anymore because like it's not that much
uh
fun to just be like low like i made an
actual bad decision and lost
like like chaos is a little zane
with some risk and a possible reward but
just getting rid of wooden nickel and
being like well i'm dumb
is kind of like i don't know
insubordinate and and churlish
and plus if you go zany like to the
freaking
you know until the sweat go drips down
your you know whats
every single time
sure it's not zany anymore
if you're if you're always zany then
you're like you know you're never zany
you're just like i'm the guy who's
afraid to win so i just
throw runs away i'm in charge of my own
destiny
but your suffering is 20 of my value bro
have you been reading
the back seating like then you should be
having like the the 20
of my value that's your suffering should
have been like 5x this stream so far
are you reading some of the advice
that's coming in here it's it'll blow
your mind
you know it's not great
but a 7 cent robo baby 2.0 is
is something worth more than a dang
ladder at least
flying is good
keeper does look funny
look at the keeper smiling
no no no no no hold on we need bombs
dross too we need bombs
any particular reason you're playing as
uh the keeper
yeah i mean we gotta play as everybody
to like to unlock everything
you have about no i mean i need bombs to
go to the next alt path
so we need to play as the keeper at some
point anyway just to
just to get everything unlocked that
needs to get unlocked
hold on i'm just taking a little
tolerance break for my own sanity
[Laughter]
i'm just looking at the at the at the
wall
thank you apollo i appreciate that
actually you you've
like a guardian angel you have swooped
down in a moment of
great uh strife for me and you have
gifted me salvation
i came one freight neuron away from
losing my
my mind and then i
i just a single shut up weirdos from
apollo has
has given me the greatest gift of all
some inner peace no no no
okay that's fine we weren't gonna get a
deal with the devil anyway
i'm not sweating hold your bombs this is
spooky
no i'm bad and take the pill shot speed
up that was a risky pill
i know what you do now i know what you
do now
chill out couple of bombs here and there
can of corn
just remember what mouth says can of
corn and i'll be all right
okay certainly not the item you're
looking for
certainly not the item you're looking
for
we've already done keeper mega satan
okay get me out of here
there's plays there's plays you drop two
of these
you go to the boss strap room you use
the emperor card
not the emperor sorry you use the moon
card to get out of the
boss trap room or you okay just just
relax on that for a second as long as we
don't walk in the blue fires we're doing
well
still pretty good still very good
get the bubbly burps man he's got the
bubbly burps
okay white fire mirror
uh definitely i don't see myself
fighting the boss on this one
did you see that apollo is getting a
haircut
that's pretty exciting
that means uh mouth can't be far behind
i don't know mouth might keep the
lettuce rolling though i don't know
probably a better trinket oh malthus do
yeah i mean like it honestly the long
hair it kind of suits him
i don't even mean that facetiously like
he's kind of like
i never thought about it but he's kind
of like a long hair sort of guy
especially with the beanie on it looks
uh it looks cool
i'm vibing with it
has anyone ever seen mouth without his
hat
uh yeah it's been a while though for
sure
apollo are you reading this man is this
what among us is like
[Laughter]
this i can't complain it's just a
staggering amount of like
nonsense questions over and over oh my
god
500 people saying tinted rock when you
don't have a bomb
talking about mouths hair 900 people say
when are you getting your hair cut low
i thought all your friends were bald
lull like it's crazy
man just chill out
if you were funnier than me you wouldn't
be watching me you'd be watching shibley
right now
it's a simple calculus
he's not on that's true might have gone
a little hard during apex legends
yesterday
lfg
it's the easter crowd yeah i didn't
realize like guess what easter you're
like the new st patrick's day for me
welcome to the list of bad holidays
hello mr anez
thank you for the gifted subscription
i'm not gonna lie it is it is swages the
the salt slightly okay hold on hold on
that could be very good
no don't hit me we don't care about big
fan
like that item getting out of here
that's no big deal
i'm just wondering if sacrificial or
roba baby for that matter
i'm just wondering if we're going to
actually get um devil deal items out of
this or
because of chaos they'll just be like
normal items but either way i think it's
a good idea
those are definitely devil deal items
it's you're probably right it's all the
like uh cadbury mini eggs and stuff like
that
those cream eggs they probably got like
30 grams of sugar in each one
i stood right in the middle of that wait
wait wait there's a theme a theme has a
higher chance to give you uh
demon hearts right it's go no they took
it out i forgot they took it out
i tried to save it by uh
by ranking it in the d tier but you guys
had no chill you were like he's a fool
it's an a tier
edmond watched and was like oh we gotta
knock that out in the dlc
way to go guys way to go
made them nerf a d-tier item because you
couldn't keep your chill
it's one heck of a room okay
leave that we can go to the curse room
now
it's a great song you got to admit
apollo have you caught um a hound doom
yet
i don't know if you're still here you
basically said told people to shut up
and then left
which i really and this is genuine i
respect
you are here okay you said good one
thank you i learned it from chipley
i thought i had a joke for you the other
day but i can't remember what it was
it was a good one though like rest the
shirt like in my head i was like oh
apollo would love this one
so like if you could just laugh and say
thank you that would be ideal
sounds funny like it was a good one
haha
what
all right at least at least he took
himself out of the equation there for a
second
i've never seen large bomb
man you know be crazy you don't be one
heck of a meme
is like imagine if we like picked up a
damage upgrade at some point
sorry sorry that's not fair we have the
pact
i don't see what you're complaining
about you've you've been uh
you've only been on the run for 38
minutes you already have one damage
upgrade like i don't see what you're
complaining about
yeah the mark that's what i meant same
difference
this is gonna do it man this is gonna do
it
okay blanket is holy mantle on the boss
fight
and a bunch of flies i actually think
that's
pretty amazing i think we need that for
maximum devil deals then we use the
devil deals to give us the maximum
chance of
uh actually getting a useful item
despite the fact that
now that i think about it it's not gonna
it's gonna be chaos but still
okay
dull rays are a thing i again it's like
you're not
necessarily wrong but like
we got it it takes a lot to get rid of
wooden nickel
and i'm not sure that like a thame doing
a little damage is uh
is what we're looking for they won't
even let me keep the hanged man
yeah if we had swallowed penny then then
maybe well if we had swallowed penny
then definitely
okay i'm feeling okay here
this is like the boss i love the seed
this boss listens to reason
it does attacks that in some
circumstances are dodgeable
which i'm i highly approve of i was
literally just about to pick up the
freaking
my devil no we still got a good devil
deal chance how did that happen
well it like as good as it was when
before we came in because we had already
taken a hit i think
don't hit me dude come on be reasonable
oh it's because it's not the final room
yet it's an xl floor
yeah okay well you know
suppose we might as well
i mean i'd still like to win this blue
baby like you know
it's still got to be done as well this
is going to be annoying
yeah i'm less worried i would oh my gosh
i i'd say for the time being like i'm
less worried about my character
and much more worried about like how i'm
gonna get the means with which
to actually like finish this run
because it's a little unimpressive right
now it's a little underpowered
hello
come on guys you're taking like 12 shots
right to the face
actually now i'm just like i'm concerned
we may actually just
die
we have invisible enemies okay that's
fine that's fine a thame will take care
of them
can of corn can of corn and i'll be all
right
invisible marty's welcome
okay what's 16 chance it's like one in
one and six pick a number between
one and six chad
everybody that said four you're getting
the deal with the devil
clip farming 101 baby
don't kill me just begging you not to
kill me
just we gotta take dad's ring
use oh get me out of here okay okay hold
on d7 reroll rewards don't mind if i
don't
elden ring
yeah apollo don't be shy tell us what
you ordered
i had some poke yesterday
saved i haven't chosen yet well don't be
shy what are the options
it sucks oh i guess you you probably got
like a low
choice coefficient today because of uh
easter sunday right
that's probably one of those times you
sign into uber eats and it's like all
you've got is
uh you know it's like burger king pizza
hut
i'm about to get zach's piece i'm the
zaxby's
scooby-doo
you know the vibe
zaxby's is good i've never i've never
had it
canada lags behind in the in the
the chicken game
we got great i mean in vancouver at
least great like korean fried chicken
but as far as like chain chicken
restaurants
not so much popeyes is starting to
spread there's a few
churches
i think there's like a chick-fil-a in in
downtown toronto
you know we need in canada man we need
some shake shacks
admittedly i've only eaten that one but
like
i was very impressed i was very
impressed
i you know that's the kind of thing
where you're like maybe if i didn't have
0.9 speed there would be some hope for
me
yo shadow insurgent thank you for the
gifted subs as well
that's fine at least we got the the coin
shortcut oh that's not a shortcut at all
the speed man okay good good good good
good
don't get trapped get saved
long room i was set up for failure there
like i've only i saw someone say
let's go by the way i uh the baby let's
go
i saw someone say that five guys is
better than shake shack
i will own up to the fact that i've only
eaten that uh
one five guys and one shake shack but
it wasn't even close like the shake
shack blew it out of the water
maybe it was a bad five guys maybe it
was a great shake shack
but it was like it wasn't even a contest
bro i'm still gonna die what
ah he's the smartest man alive
saved
joanna won
new joanna just dropped
yeah like i don't know like i know it's
very like
north america is a land of um
contradictions
i guess you know it's just any time you
get a lot of people
there's a lot of opinions right
everybody eats
uh from chain restaurants now and then
but you have to like almost pretend that
it never happens or like you were forced
into it like you didn't have a choice
if you were ever like where do you want
to eat and you're an adult and you say
wendy's
people will get like in your face
they'll be like you can eat anyone you
live in a
a city with amazing food options you
want to eat at wendy's
like dude sometimes a spicy chicken
would just hit the spot
this is highly scary
straight up i'm like outback she's like
chili's so then finally i suggested
taylor's
which is the place i knew she wanted to
go anyway
and she was like if that's what you want
dare roll i looked that woman right in
the windows of her soul
and i said i can't i can't do the thing
where i don't look at the screen
i'm gonna die
what am i doing what it worked i'm alive
i'm great
that's the thing like i do i love a
chain restaurant
it's not it doesn't make up the bulk of
my my food intake
i don't know what how to stop you okay
so if you could just
frick off um i named seven more
restaurants
no no finally i suggested taylor's the
place i knew she wanted to go anyway
anyway i like a i like a chain uh i like
a chain restaurant
because then like i've said it before
you don't just get a meal you get a
conversation too
because you can talk about the
restaurant that you ate at
with other people who have eaten at that
restaurant
instead of like you know in you know in
vancouver i could go eat it like an
amazing place go eat like miku or you
know bishops or something like that
now i'm talking to somebody that's from
south carolina i can't be like oh i
hated this awesome place
you've never heard of before you know
what i mean
i mean you could do it but it's very
like you know it's self-aggrandizing
you're just like let me tell you about
this awesome meal i ate that you can't
possibly have the same experience of
instead you go you go eat at a long john
silvers you could be like you know what
i had yesterday
long john silvers
they'll be like yo pog or uh
monka don't you know the ceo of long
john silver's 19 years ago
was on a news interview and he said like
he
uh hates charities or something like
that and you're like oh come on man
i did i didn't look that up in the full
audit before i bought the hush puppies
but it's pretty sweet right it's a fun
time
come on man
i just walked though i suggested seven
more restaurants
yeah i'm gonna be really mad if uh
america kills long john silvers before i
get to eat there
i guess they're not really in an
expansion phase right like they're kind
of
on the way out uh well nevertheless okay
okay that's something
i don't know why i'm like lying to
myself saying like there's any chance
long john silvers is gonna like
you know they're coming back man they're
coming back
i don't even know what you do like i
don't know what your thing is
how can like a a chain seafood
restaurant be bad
like if you deep fry almost anything
that came from the ocean
it tastes great i don't understand how
you can screw it up
the fish is fine joey's only is bad
yo you pump the brakes in
in my hometown well if in my in my
hometown if you're uptown
joey's that's the place where you go
if you want fish and chips if you're
downtown you probably go to the pilot
house or something but
okay okay now we're talking fashion
chops
shut up mom where's my fashion chops
oh the tower you know they buffed it
recently
for they've recently added more hops
take book of shadows it's actually like
a really good idea
that's like an insanely good idea also
an insanely good idea
what the heck
uh don't pick up the coin when you don't
need it
what are you doing come on are you
busking this is so tricky oh i do do we
have epiphora am i insane
we've had epiphora this whole time huh
would have helped us out on some of
these rooms that take 20 years
i.e every room in the game
so i know apollo's here so i'm laying it
on a little thick we did get a deal
okay i mean
i feel like charm of the vampire is
pretty sick here
uh holy grail unfortunately is not good
for us
unless i'm missing something but
holy grail does damage now it's
worthless now
it's good now
thanks i really appreciate it head eyes
i'm dead are you shooting are you
walking on metal
i don't know just take it hard to argue
with that honestly
okay i guess you know i'm trying to
think it is nice to explore
because if we get more money like oh we
only need to do this
this menagerie one time right like
if we could just get
a like a combo that just wins the game
for you
it'll really go a long way well this
would be bookworm
or it could just be a key as well that
could be stolen from me cool yeah
yeah brimstone would hit the spot no
doubt about that
dude every every
youtube uh run of isaac is either
let me rephrase every stream vod that
ends up as a standalone episode on
youtube
is either 80 minutes long or 21 minutes
long there's literally no exception
it's just it's it's madness
it's a war of attrition
okey-dokey
just a wee bit of trolling i mean i'm
not upset about the
the holy grail situation we it's fine we
got keys
we spent some money on something we
didn't need to spend money on that's not
that big of a deal
okay not secret rooms possible secret
room
that's really good that's very valuable
i'm begging you
i'm begging i know you're
you're not like the best demon judgment
we could ever ask for but you're the
demon judgment we got
chaos or otherwise
i'm keeping the salt mostly at bay
because i you know
that's not really like who i am as a
streamer it's like let's just complain
about
things i mean like i complain about
things in real life when it comes to the
games i'm like the games are precious
don't don't uh don't insult the games
um that being said like i'm
there's been a couple repentance runs
where i'm like
who hurt you
it's your favorite thing to complain
about it's definitely like people
not like i don't know
it's very minor i would never try to
suggest like it's good
like or a healthy frame of mind the
number one thing i complain about
is is in this recurring theme of people
like being so lost in their
own world they inhibit other people
around them you know distracted drivers
people asking for you know too many
samples at the deli counter
stuff like that is like you know
something turns you into the joker but
like in a
in a very pedestrian sense
please don't give me hope no key beggar
you know what sure just go for it man
just just go for it man
oh don't even get me started on that on
the ante masters dude
and now like we got they they shut down
indoor dining
in the uh vancouver but so now they
took the they made patios but then they
closed in the patios
so they made the outside inside
but it's like apparently that's like
some kind of loophole or something like
that where the virus is like oh
we can't do anything they made the
inside outside
exactly we made the outside inside
yeah everyone everybody knows like the
virus
is powerless if you're on a patio
especially one that's been closed in and
has literally no ventilation
and if you're in a classroom like it
just it simply can't hurt you
all the science is it points to this
this one conclusion
but mostly like i mean i i'm not trying
like we can just stay inside like i you
know that's
we're blessed in that sense that we can
essentially just
look it's mighty tempting i don't think
we're gonna lose our uh
i don't think we're gonna lose the knife
in the process this might be a genuine
re-roll here
i think we do it
i have no idea what this is but it's
actually
freaking sick let's let's try it out
um
i don't know it seems pretty good
we did lose wooden nickel that's pretty
bad
[Laughter]
yeah that's that's optimal
um but like i
i think we're on the cusp of things
getting like pretty bad in canada again
hopefully it's like the last time they
get pretty bad
um because the you know vaccination
obviously is like ongoing but
it's like on the cusp of like real
badness here again
like this genuinely i'm not trying to
like bring it down but like
in bc and ontario right now like this is
the most apprehensive i've been about
kovitz since like last
march or last april maybe
the the spread of the variance here in
particular and
you know that that combined with the
fact that like absolutely well i
shouldn't say nobody
but like so few people seem to actually
be doing
precautions anymore because they're like
uh my grandma got vaccinated so the
whole thing's over
you know as soon as like vaccines
started happening like oh now now that
everybody in south dakota
can get vaccinated like why should i
have to wear a mask in canada you know
like it's it's getting a little uh
a little spicy up here again for sure
but we can just uh you know we're lucky
we work from home
okay that's pretty sick we can mostly
just hang out at home and
you know ride it out till we get
vaccinated which seems like it's
probably gonna be
hopefully in may but maybe in early june
which is still like i mean it's it's a
ways away but it's
you know the finish line at least you
know
part of the finish line is on the
horizon
yeah we must have curse of the or not
curse we must have dog tooth
okay what's our
do you think we still have guppy no do
you think we still have brim
no do you think we still have the ankh
that's what i was trying to say
because we have an extra life but i
don't know what it came from
how did the u.s manage to beat canada at
vaccines
well like aren't i i was gonna say
aren't you but like
oh the green one i'm following me you're
right isn't the us like making them
they if they produce it like it makes it
makes sense
plus and again this is like the overly
mature
response like obviously like i want to
get vaccinated but like
things were worse in the us it makes
sense from a public health standpoint
that they would get them
first although that's not really how
they're being distributed i guess like
in terms of greatest need
but it's it's kind of hard to be too
salty about it when there's still the
opportunity to just be mad at like my
own
uh fellow citizens for like
just not following the precautions at
all
okay hold on hold on
you can tap shoot it's a little slow
but i can tap shoot
we need to find a way to get some money
you know what just this card
now we're talking
let's go yeah exactly
this is definitely not gg i'm i resent
the gg call here
yeah i mean we have the same thing
because i don't we don't even need to
get into it like too much but
um
great damage okay this actually might be
gg
[Laughter]
doesn't matter what we take
just make sure you take the alt path
that's that's insanely good damage
that sucks thank god we had the justice
card backing us up we we still need some
form of defense like i'm not getting my
hopes up too much yet
i'm shaking saved i told you like nobody
cares about the defense man until it's
too late
we need we need like one more thing here
to really get it going
um but yeah we got like the same thing
going in uh
in vancouver where there's like a few
restaurants that
are like no we're not gonna shut down
and then they've become like you know
rallying points for
uh idiocy to be fair
and uh and it's just like oh it's just
like i
i'm just like exclusively my my only
reaction is like i'm just
i'm just ben affleck.jpeg you know what
i mean like i'm just
i'm either picking up a bunch of dunkin
donuts on my front step begging the
paparazzi not to take a photo of me or
like
i'm smoking a cigarette on my front step
just being like i'm so sick of this
nonsense like you could just
wait you just wait like like two months
the government doesn't want you to have
sangria on the patio i'm like i just
just just two months just do it in may
the weather's not even like nice yet
the government doesn't want you to have
mozzarella sticks with your friends
okay we we need bombs for sure
oh
[Laughter]
no not yet not yet we hold them
we hold them and we use it as a uh
we use it as a desperation play
like there was somebody on the vancouver
subreddit i was laughing so hard like
they're
not all of them but like they're so
gleeful about like
breaking the rules and i'm just like
like somebody was like
hey don't want to make you guys jealous
but i have 18 friends over right now at
my house playing video games and they
posted it like
like on 10 different threads and i'm
just like
nobody cares loser you really you got 18
friends over your house and you're like
i gotta go
post about it on reddit like are you are
you stupid
also you've got 18 friends over at your
house playing video games what the hell
are you playing
are you doing like a full eu4 game like
if so like that makes me a little more
jealous than anything else to be honest
you're playing jack box you little
too full among us lobbies sorry paul i
didn't want it's your day off i don't
wanna
i was just like man you posted like like
a hundred times
it's it's just kind of humorous i've
never been in a situation where i've
like been at like a party and having a
great time and been like hold on i gotta
go post about it
on unread it of all places so hey
you okay this keep it moving
okay that's stocks in this business we
say stocks and then we head down to the
next floor
that's not good because we really could
have used something that gave us a
material advantage instead of merely
some currency but
it is what it is
it it just reminds me of like that um
the nathan fielder picture
this like you know having a great time
with my friends they're all here
laughing just out of frame
like it's like i'm having me and my
friends are having such a good time you
guys are so owned right now like living
in fear watching netflix
i've got 18 of my closest friends over
playing video games just out of frame
you think does yamaha give us
a coin as the keeper or a fly
it probably just gives us a fly
you know what we got money we got keys
like we might as well test it yo it
gives us a coin dude
it gives us a coin or nothing but it
makes me think that it's giving me a
coin
oh yeah i forgot you live
i'm telling you though like and this is
like i'm apologizing like on behalf of
canadians okay um to to my american
countrymen because if you're like
american
or from the uk and you're getting like
vaccinated already and you're you know
17 or 20 or whatever your canadian
friends are gonna be like a little
annoyed you know i i find myself even
getting a little annoyed
it's it's not a uh it's not a nice thing
to say
but it's like you know even like a
couple of weeks ago i was like i'm happy
for people
but i really wish that i was getting
vaccinated too
so that like i could go out and eat
dinner
and now like things are getting kind of
bad and now i'm like i want to get
vaccinated so i could not
end up in a hospital with that p1
variant
so i i really do think that we're
getting into a position where like the
the vaccine fomo is going to hit like a
fever pitch for a bit
just i just ask you to like be nice to
you know canadians recognize you know
it's not your american friend's fault
that
you know you're not vaccinated yet and
then uh you know
americans recognize if the shoe were on
the other foot you'd probably be a
little annoyed as well
well let's give it a try man
i still see us getting hit
use it oh no okay we get hit one more
time we take the pill
please
he can keep getting away with it
it's still hard man is still hard
i lived somehow where's my coin
saved
i'm alive again
okay let's do some exploring
[Laughter]
this this boss is so freaking hard dude
you got something for me
i would have lost my freaking mind
i would have i might have uninstalled
you might have caught me in a moment of
weakness and i might have uninstalled
right there
freaking sexy mimics
it's so difficult you know don't
we need it we i mean i i get what people
are saying like put bombs out there but
like
even i mean i i i think it's like one of
those things where i'm just like we're
still gonna get hit
like
[Laughter]
and try as i might like the damage
output will help out a lot don't get me
wrong
it's gonna be worth something
unfortunately assuming the okay that was
one up so we actually
can't get
there's no point really the playing the
blood bank
we could use that for one extra like hp
in a moment of weakness but
the blood bank has has low value right
now okay
i don't know man i feel like we're we're
still better off with yum heart than
than book of belial
like i still feel like defense is the
name of the game like we're not going to
be rushing this guy down to the point
that he's gonna like
like i don't think having like super
high damage output is gonna get us there
that's what i'm saying
isn't the blood bank free okay now now
you're gonna make me lose my mind up in
here
up in here because uh
i mean it's something we covered like
right at the start of the run
come on
i can't do it it can't be done
can't be done can be done
i can't do it right now
we gotta give ourselves a try i'm trying
to think of what card it could even be
that would really
send us and there's some stuff that
would be half decent
but then there's other stuff that i'm
like i mean i don't think it would be
enough to move the needle
i think the best way to move the needle
is to not die
sonova for no reason
try to get it moving drop some bombs in
there
drop some drop more bombs in there
i think we're on one hit i'm one tap
he's one tenth
i walked into it we were gonna die
anyway
but that's not the way you want to go
[Laughter]
the odds of me not getting hit in phase
two were pretty low
dude this run is uh is hard it's



hey uh we're gonna try to like i've been
getting my butt kicked in isaac on
stream today so we're just gonna play as
isaac
and try to go to the the secret door
which i think i understand how to get to
but uh we'll see
i mean you can try to roast me in chat
for not having done that well today but
like
we we exclusively swung for the fences
we were mainlining like the hardest
characters trying to get to the
the alt path exclusively so i'm not like
too upset about
uh about today
i thought we did a uh you know you're
gonna you're gonna break a few eggs if
you try to make a sick omelette
yeah plus we crush trivia so no sweat
dude
so i don't think we need to go
to um the alt path on this one i think
we well in fact i think we have to not
go to the old path because the secret
door is like only in the depths i think
golden bombs you guys remember that song
uh
golden scans by the clack songs what the
heck were they talking about you know
what i'm you know what i'm saying
what were they talking about in that
song is they're not saying i'm saying
they're saying that golden scans are
well
you can't look at your future like what
were they saying man
we put bombs in your bombs
it was golden sands it was not you look
go look up the song it's called golden
scans
i have an encyclopedic knowledge of all
musics
i can't believe you would try to to step
up to me on this one
in incoming oh sorry my bad
don't worry i'll wait okay we don't want
to buy blind items here
like it's not a bad song but i'm just
like i just don't know what they're
talking about like what the heck is this
is a golden scan man
like a radar scan or like what are they
saying
i never know i don't know where this
bit's going
it is yeah okay i see what you're saying
they do say ooh a lot in that song
oh i don't maybe that's what a golden
scan is maybe it's a type of like gold
leaf you can put on a pizza
i'm embarrassed with myself but you know
what it happens from time to time
uh let's look for secret rooms this is a
secret room play
wait is that chibly's
he's gone too far
oh it's justin's oh they got they got a
two-parter emote
those geniuses
we should do more emo team-ups
or teemo eat-ups you know if we can get
ross to get down with it
um like you know they do like
brand uh partnerships like they'll be
like hey like louis vuitton is gonna
make lightning from final fantasy 13
wear like
you know some kind of leather bound book
or something like that
we should do that on on stream like yo
new new nl cross uh ludwig just dropped
that'd be pretty sick i could just make
a papa emote without even asking him i
[Laughter]
suppose
that's that's garbage that's garbage um
it's garbage
probably the best bomb i've ever placed
it's up there at least
yeah like apollo do you want to do like
we should do some kind of team up
like there's got to be like could you
could somebody draw the among
us in a in isaac style and then draw
isaac in the among us style and we could
we could swap son of a gun man
we could swap him
that'd be pretty sick he's still talking
to apollo he was here i saw him say
lmfao when i got when i
couldn't figure out how to add two
colors together
kate if i gave you two colors of light
and said what do they make when they're
added together would you be able to
answer the question
i can't take these items or i will be
killed i'll take that one but i can't
take uh
i can't take the other one i think it
was cyan okay we totally could have
taken it
um it was like oh it was green and blue
green and blue yeah is it like purple
it's cyan this is what i did when i saw
the question

all time and he still gets into
he still gets into trouble
why is it hard they basically enemies

they shoot faster like old enemies have
like faster attack patterns
um and then some of the new floors are
like
a new enemies i should say you you gotta
have like a phd in tuhu to understand
what's going on
touhou tuhu touhou
big summer blowout
anti-pog there's some anti-pog
technology there
hey
all right kind of a tough run here
i don't know we can fly flying's pretty
sweet
i think i'm ready moving on
it's so cute when she smiles i think i'm
gonna cry
ah
i think we got a good chance here
when baby smiles i smile too
i'm just surprised you know i don't want
to ruin the moment i'm surprised there's
nobody in chat like oh
baby you're eating your hand wrong the
way you should eat your hand is
just making a joke
um have you ever considered eating uh
your other hand instead of exclusively
that one maybe godhead is inside your
other hand
hey goo yeah she probably said shut up
that's fine
she's not wrong
yeah she's she's a grown baby now
she's six months old
it's like six months and one week and
then like
i mean this is spoilers for like i mean
it's not really spoilers for eyes like
it's spoilers for the commentary
but um i had her in the playpen when i
was recording today which is just behind
me
and then i heard her going like oh oh
and then i looked behind me and she had
rolled over
like onto her stomach and was like just
chilling there on her
on her hands and knees and i was like
what the heck
you can do that now and then i
oh she's a very happy baby right now
then i you know she's having some
trouble like rolling herself back over
i looked over like five minutes later
and she was just like passed out on her
stomach
like with with no power in her muscles
left
but
usually like when she laughs she's like
she's very
laffy you can go oh
there's a knock on the door on easter
sunday no less
what's up with that
oh there's another kid could close my
office okay i'm gonna
just be one moment please i'm just gonna
put us on break for a moment just in
case
all right i'm back it was just the son
of god
love that guy i was like hey i forgot
it's your day
and he was like he's very gracious about
it but
he was like yeah it's only once a year
you know you could have at least put out
the nice uh cutlery
do you have a minute to talk about me oh
that's a good bit
hold on people keep saying is what the
heck is modulatory
i mean the game says it's the directory
is right for me
seems like you may have a pep cac issue
on your end
okay keep it moving i was like wait a
minute oh jesus i'm sorry i forgot it
was the 40th day from the
vernal equinox my bad buddy
i gotta get some mileage out of that
joke before it becomes completely
irrelevant
i forgot we had passed uh petrarch's
apoapsis
he's so good uh you're alive his worst
enemy in the game now
this guy worst enemy in the game full
stop full stop i hate you
why is everyone so pog about easter this
year
i don't think it's i don't know i i
haven't noticed a disproportionate
amount of easter pogging
it is in my opinion the first real hot
really
oh you gotta shoot down here okay
i think it's the first real holiday on
the calendar right so like
he has risen
well yeah i sure hope somebody got fired
for that blunder
what about new year's day i don't know
like new year's eve i think is like a
real holiday new year's day i'm always
like i'll take it
it's like when they give you a fortune
cookie after your meal it's like i never
would have ordered this for myself but
like if you're gonna give me a day i'm
not gonna say no
obviously it's kind of nice to have the
day off
apart from that i'm like you know i mean
we get into the cool holidays now
you know christmas is pretty close
uh oh dude okay so rune bag like isn't
as good anymore but that's still
freaking sick
it's like free tortilla chips at a
mexican restaurant
i hear you
there are perks of like eden in man like
it's very minor like obviously there's
other
negatives about covid but i'm still like
i'm beating the same
drum there are some foods that just
don't deliver as well
and i i miss them a little bit i haven't
had a good hamburger in a long time
i mean honestly i could be making my own
to be fair but
you know i i just me personally it takes
a little bit more motivation for me to
like
make a hamburger than it does to just
buy one from like a when you're eating
out because you gotta
it's you know you you buy enough ground
beef for like one burger
probably not right in one bun you're
probably gonna end up getting like
a bunch of burgers a bunch of buns and
then you're like am i really gonna
eat like six burgers in two days i kind
of only wanted one
i mean it's not i'm not saying it's like
super negative i'm just saying
you know for me personally i'd rather uh
give me the ace of clubs here man i
could use these bombs
you know i treat eating out sometimes as
an opportunity to eat things that like i
don't want to
make for myself for one reason or
another i don't buy burger stuff that
often uh
for myself uh just because you know
usually i don't want like six burgers
usually i just want like
maybe like one and a half burgers
we have a freezer but like
i'm gonna put like fill up my actually
you know we have like the ultimate
freezer excuse right now which is
there's literally like
you know 20 liters of breast milk in our
freezer so
there's really no space for like
anything else
but uh you know once we work our way
through that
i don't know i'm surprised of the people
who are like oh you know
just use your freezer you have a craving
for one food you buy like eight times
more than your craving and then freeze
it
and then what do you do oh well you know
wait until you can't put anything in
your freezer and then throw out the
seven burgers when you move or whatever
can you actually freeze breast milk oh
kate we forgot to look it up in the
rigorous
uh analysis we did before having the
baby
cage chat's got it off chat
as the very we looked it up it's fine
i wouldn't sweat it okay i'm gonna go to
this curse room real quick
do we have we don't have a reroll
pedestal
i will take these i'm not scared
just never really thought of it i mean
like why would you right like
[Laughter]
is that an easy hack to get regular milk
you could just buy
ice cream and let it melt i think
there's a there's a catch though right
which is that like ice cream
uh is not just milk
and then the second catch is that is
sometimes more expensive than milk to
begin with
oh just what i've always wanted rocky
road milk
i'm not this is like one oh dude new uh
new animation just dropped
it's one of those things where i'm like
you know i remember where i lost a lot
of uh
optimism for the internet is like when i
first heard what a life hack was i was
like this is gonna change everything
like before life hacks you had to just
like hope you met
somebody that had some kind of like cool
secret way they're like oh here's the
trick to like doing this
and then you know you would spread it by
word of mouth i thought the internet was
gonna like revolutionize it i thought it
was gonna democratize
those neat little tricks and then you
know we all learned how to like fold a
t-shirt properly in four seconds
and that was the only one like every
other life hack is actually
it's just useless it's just not good
we'll take it we'll take it
like i i can't even the only other life
hack i can even think of is like the one
where it was like
you know hey life pro tip like you're uh
you're peeling bananas from the wrong
end
it's like nobody cares
what do you mean the wrong end i've
never like peeled a banana and been like
oh
it's reversed you know it's just a
banana
i love that one so what so you like you
know you peel the banana from like the
nub instead of the
the thing at the top how does that
change anything though
i don't understand i also i used
i did that for probably like six or
seven years i peeled my bananas like
that and was like one of these days i'm
gonna like master
it and i i really i just went back the
the maybe like three or four years ago
and i was like i think that the tab is
actually just better
i think the tab is uh i i prefer to use
the tab
having done both quite a lot
anyway it's not a problem either way i
mean i can you think of like a life tip
you've learned on the internet that's
actually
like helped you out there's probably
some i'm not saying there's none
but
none okay maybe there's none
i feel like like like meal prepping is
like
a nice life hack that really spread
even wider after the internet got on got
onto it
that that's a positive for sure
brushing my teeth in the shower
i mean i guess it's a life hack
people are going to be mad at you for
that one but i i say live your life
is a waste of water for sure
i remember sheryl crow saying that she
only like to save the environment she
only used one piece of toilet paper
anytime she wiped her butt and then like
everybody was like ew and then she was
forced to give a statement like a couple
of weeks later where she was like
i was just joking about all that i just
thought it'd be funny
and i was like i don't think so
okay tomo wants to come in all right
okay hey tomorrow
hey buddy like here's a live pro tip for
you a life hack
uh buy an air fryer it's freaking hey
don't get into the cords don't ma
get in the box buddy yeah yeah the box
there he goes
oh when you use too small a slice
yeah i'm a folder not a not a crusher
i mean it might be like tmi but
the crusher let's not call them crushers
let's call them crumplers
i understand it but i'm a folder for
sure and i got to tell you again this is
tmi as well but like
the baby since she started eating solid
food like if i could go back to that
witch game i would wish for the baby
poops to be
as gentle as they were when she was on a
pure milk diet
because other parents warned me
100 percent they were like hey you know
i know you're
thinking that all the diapers are like
totally fine right now but like wait
till she starts eating solid food and i
was like uh
whatever they were totally right like
the poops have become like cataclysmic
i mean it's still not that bad like you
know i'd rather have like
nasty poops but get a good night's sleep
which is basically how things are going
right now but
they definitely got worse
don't take my eternal heart or i'm gonna
be mad okay
officially not mad
and then re-roll it for free why not
you're right you're already here re-roll
it for free
dude dude red candle dude red candle is
pretty good
now that's an item
i got to think about this for a sec
did you read that they nerfed orbitals i
didn't see that but i did see that they
recently added
more hops
one two three four you know what i i
think we can let's let's
just chill for a minute actually we can
just buy a battery what am i thinking
here
that's pretty sick we could reroll that
too though
oh but we can get the double reroll
i'm re-rolling i'm re-rolling sorry red
candle
you did your best
hold on hold on because doesn't this
give
one full heart every time you use it now
dude that's amazing
converter is is is pog now
confirmed pog now we'll get a charge
we'll re-roll again i mean i don't mind
if we have to roll skinny odd mushroom
and then do some some re-rolls that's
fine although now i don't know if i can
get
what i needed because there's no enemies
left apparently
yeah i don't know if i can actually get
a charge now in fact i'm
one two three boss can't get into the
uh special room there's a mini battery
there's a mini battery thank you
i need enemies please
i'm gonna risk it dude
let's go well worth it hopefully
it's an attempt was made
it is mini mush yeah yeah but minnie
mouse is like it's
minnie mouse it's not that bad minnie
mush is okay
i got no no negatives to say about it
it's not that good but it's terra bad oh
come on don't call it
don't don't make up a new word by mixing
two words together
it's not that that level of badness come
on
charged key is it
i don't think that's a charged key man i
think it's just sparkling
let's let's test it that's just
sparkling
it is okay hold on oscar
nov would you like to explain yourself
there was no asterisk in your message
there was no um
i could be wrong there was no i think in
my opinion i'm guessing etc etc
just said it is
please explain yourself posthaste
welcome to chat court i didn't know
apparently i stole this bit from lemmy
but if you're gonna steal
you might as well steal from like the
funniest person on twitch and if you
can't steal from chibley then you might
as well steal from lemmy
yo pear throw now we're talking um
funny
i still think like because it's a
passive i still think it's pretty good
to reroll these instead and this is
catacombs two catacombs and i'll be all
right kind of
catacombs and i'll be all right
we'll take this because it's fine
and then i think we'll just take skinny
on mushroom it is not terrible
it's actually terra good like terrific
and good instead of terrible and bad
and then we got a per throw for a good
devil deal chance here
hey eat this
take one of these dude pyro with these
bombs would go a long way
1000 gift subs or i reroll brimstone
just kidding
[Laughter]
how funny would that be though anyway um
okay
okay we got it we need a teleporter we
need a teleport card right
i which makes me a little upset at
myself because we had a bunch of
teleporter cards and then i turned them
into uh
ace of clubs which is pretty funny
in hindsight not a good uh
oh the devs two will always have one
okay now we're talking
thank you
very helpful yeah yeah yeah
i think thank you i appreciate those i
thinks
also drop a bad trinket in an item room
really
for what purpose
to to what end dude i'm having like
omega
deja vu right now i feel like i've
already had this conversation before
that's for another thing i think
no need not needed yet okay
not needed yet you think and i think
thank you i think i will say
thank you
yo that's pretty good
and l you look wonderful today i think
thank you chatter
i think you're right also thank you
because
we put you on chat trial last week and
that's a very positive message i
appreciate it
yeah why not
i know i just would look was it did i
bring that up just so you'd realize that
i don't forget your name yes
it was a flex i don't want you to think
that i've
you know your name will ever escape my
mind so just be on your best behavior
i think
yes sir there we go yes sir
okay what around depths one it's too
late i've already seen everything
i'm a new-ish chatter yes sir
welcome you picked a good time to buy
in the rocket ship to the moon is gonna
start any day now
i'm new here smile apollo don't make me
go through your unban requests
i actually check them like i check them
maybe once every two days but
i i assumed that from
the among us new map there would be a
lot of uh
on band requests but there were
literally zero
which i think is a good thing
my perthro yoink
okay tinted rock this is my favorite
game can i
find a tinted rock chat was calling out
yes because they told me where it was
that's a charge key i think
[Laughter]
have you ever watched bojack horseman so
here's the thing and you're
nobody's gonna be happy with this okay
so we might as well just get it out of
the way
um i've heard the show is amazing
i watched like episode one season one it
didn't do it for me i hear it gets a lot
better
this was like seven years ago or
something like that um
but here's what i'm gonna say here's the
part that's gonna annoy you okay
an adult's cartoon for me
has to be like 10 times more good
than a uh a live action show
for me to get over the animation hump
and it's ignorant
i can't i have nothing to say in my own
defense it's merely that like i feel
like i've seen
so many adult cartoons in my life that
like i'm just done
like i just roll my eyes right even
though i hear that bojack horseman is
incredible
like it i can't remember like the last
uh triple takes i don't know if strength
matters
like i i just i can't remember the last
time like
i opened up netflix and was like oh pog
an animated show for adults
i've seen like bob's burgers like i i've
had an okay time watching some bob's
burgers but
i don't know just i think i'm just out
of it like
i think the show is good but
so what i guess
i don't know i'm always like i'm having
like a pleasant time watching this like
i'm
modestly relaxed but it just doesn't get
the blood pumping you know
yeah not like something like rick and
morty something for intellectuals
dude i can't keep riding the lightning
here
our damage is good we got brimstone we
don't need to take
death's touch our hp is in a dangerous
spot what you do instead
is you re-roll and we take nothing and
we say
we say thank you we say thank you and we
move on
we're going to need some hp for whatever
the heck we're doing next
yeah exactly like bob's bro not bob's
brain bob's burgers is like it's pretty
good but it's
freaking how is it supposed to compete
with that hbo documentary about the life
of luciano pavarotti
i'm not joking either like tinted skull
real dad ours i mean i just think it's
remarkable like
you know the man he had a great voice he
lived
he lived a crazy life
isn't he gonna freeze himself
cheryl crows sang opera with pavarotti
once
look you know nobody's perfect
charge baby
you know h john benjamin is a great
voice for sure
why the animation negativity well it's i
don't know it's
honestly like the irrationality of it is
that it's just like
literally the most popular shows of well
it
literally is doing a lot of work there
the most popular shows
for my age group when i was growing up
were like cartoons but they say swears
sometimes
and i think i just literally from 2002
to 2009 that's like all i watched
and now i'm just kind of i'm just done
with it i like i want to see real human
beings now
um give me a re-roll you know what i'll
don't try that
excuse me can be in conception give us
incubus
let's go the baby let's go
and i will also say like i feel like
family guy really ruined it for the rest
of
the industry
like my my distaste
for family guy has made me not want to
watch
old simpsons futurama
like
i'm trying to get blood bag here even
though they're different shows it's like
it
it's like you know you ever like i think
some people out there they like ate
lettuce and got food poisoning and
they're like that's it i'm not even
gonna eat like arugula in the future
and i feel like that's like that's what
happened to me with
animation probably the 17th time that
peter griffin got in a fight with that
chicken
i was like i'm just i'm sorry i'm just
done
i think i'm out
it was the third time for me i remember
little brim baby
plus like i'm gonna watch like a lot of
cartoons
without a doubt as the baby gets older
like you know it's coming
i'm gonna be up to my freaking eyeballs
in cartoons i think uh
oh that's pretty good
dude this i don't know what happens once
we get past this next section but
i have seen a little paw patrol
like not not enough to form an opinion
on it because like i'm sure i'll see
enough to form an opinion eventually but
yeah yeah yeah it's for the baby exactly
i'm not trashing bojack horseman you
know i just said it didn't do it for me
i acknowledged that you know that
it's a very critically uh acclaimed show
that hurts or does it
it's just you know it's not for me
like you gotta remember like that's not
hp okay
you gotta remember if i was like hey you
know make sure to tune in to bloomberg
news canada on mondays
larry berman's always on at 8 a.m uh
pacific time he's got great in uh
insight as to what etfs are well
positioned right now
you probably tell me to shut up right
and i would just accept that because i'm
an adult
um but if i say like i don't really want
to watch bojack horseman people are like
i want you to die
it's like come on that's too far
i mean i get that bojack horseman is
like you know deals with mature issues
but like so does larry berman
on market call you know like what's
our canadian financial stocks well
positioned right now they got a lot of
cash in reserve
and presumably interest rates are going
to come up that's a mature discussion
let's let's go
i think we might we might get some
momentum here
yes but does he have a drinking problem
i wouldn't
prognosticate honestly like if he does
he keeps it outside of the scope of the
show
it's subtext
you should get the tinted skull as well
though
okay but why
okay hold on we definitely take we
definitely do not take
get into the habit that's fair that's a
good point
tinted skull tinted
skull
tinted just hold up it's tinted tinted
skull
brimstone bombs oh cause we got we got
weirdo bombs okay another fool car
oh right yeah cause we just blew up the
yeah yeah yeah i knew that
are you jerk
lemao under case lamount the the best
reaction you could
you can prompt from chat

i'm shooting
squeeze
send it man send it rune bag plus alges

stratosphere i'm ready for it
okay maybe don't go to the curse room
we got the wafer oh yeah this is doing
numbers
good book please oh baby
oh baby so there's bookworm
i think we definitely freaking at least
want to
use satanic bible it's probably good to
hold it as well
but on the other hand we could freaking
suck it up dude you're never gonna get a
you're never gonna get a suck
opportunity like this
you know what you take the satanic bible
you suck them up it was
actually not that good to begin with so
i'm glad we got some hp out of it
that's the play for sure uh
let's go
he could do it this is like
i mean isaac is a lot like dark souls
right like
if you give me a single enemy
the the other final boss not accepted
or accepted i should say um
i feel pretty okay if you give me a
large room with a bunch of little
marties on it that's where i
get frightened
get killed well they just make a button
you can step on
and it kills all the enemies
i thought this game was supposed to be
weren't people complaining this is
too hard
[Laughter]
tooth and nail you feel prickly maybe we
do contact damage to enemies or
something
i don't know great item trash item
of course well the thing is we don't
really need the coupon
so i think we'll just take tarot cloth
i guess i guess if you take coupon into
the devil deal
you could get uh the boss item
for free
i'm i keep turning gold
i keep i keep turning into a statue
there will be no deals anymore oh come
on man not even from the boss
oh cause i got spikes when i stand still
maybe i don't know
hold up hold up hey
the generosity knows no bounds golden
razor has appeared in the basement
yo tarot cloth is going to be sick here
too
spikes give you immunity from demon
judgment
i'm kind of kind of scared though
oh we have the wafer we can do it like
this because i don't know what how to
trigger the spikes
just take it i'm not a coward shot speed
up that's pretty much game winning
thank you they come and go every five
seconds
who do they think they are things from
sufjan steven's most popular song
chicago
bret okay hold on
give me some red hearts please
try just try it i don't know what i
don't know what that means
to to to play us out what does that mean
waiting for the spikes to go to go away
i don't know what it means
don't hold on okay every five seconds
okay we get
okay and then you get one play on him
every five seconds okay you know what
now that i thought about it for two
seconds that makes sense
isn't that going to take 1 000 years
though
that's too much time this like i don't
know man that's like
15 times the average human lifespan
i still took damage was i just too slow
appear to still you trolled me oh you
[Laughter]
you got me
no when when you get me that good that's
not like
an occasion to ban that's an occasion to

saint stevo okay
it's at least some demon hearts i'm not
too mad about that
a little trolling's okay yeah i don't

even larger horn

dude it's just it's flappy bird
i'll have you know i uh possibly one of
the greatest flappy bird players
you'll ever see in your life
also i don't want to brag pretty sick at
cuphead as well
some cuphead-esque elements here just
dodge the bullets for him
my god he's good okay what first
horseman of the apocalypse no problem
dude it's just contra yo it's
a little bit of aladdin on the genesis
vibe here huh
it's pretty sick what happens if you
can't fly here surely they give you
flight right
and i'm not talking about irish spring
green green green
they give you flight okay well as far as
i'm concerned they should give me super
flight then because i had it in advance
oh they show you in the cutscene yeah
that's a good point that's a good point
you just fall in the larva
he grew wings in the cutscene oh is that
cannon i didn't know
don't tell kathleen kennedy
toasted
dude speed is like an incredible stat
here
use your bombs
well dude that is actually pretty sick
yo whatever you do to the bombs they get
like multiplied by the lava
oh no i have scatter bombs oh you're in
a world of hurt
i think it's fair to say this is a very
instructive run
we're learning a lot
just juggle them just juggle them i
don't want it dude dude
oh i gotta leave one
i imagine if you kept them going the
whole way though super meat boy
keep shooting pick your moments
now it's aladdin
you're gonna oh okay okay okay
just make sure you keep shooting you
know you get the dodging down and you do
the shooting
you get the dodging down you get you do
the shooting he's gonna spit them all
out okay you should not have stood there
it's just super hexagon okay you should
probably stay up on that one huh
you're gonna chase me back the other way
you son of a gun
i knew it
i'm pretty stoked we ended up getting
the strongest run of all time
i'm also very stoked that chad told me
to take satanic bible
were it not for that i feel like uh
i feel like life would have been pretty
tough that is awesome though
this is like you know if you've ever
complained about the late game bosses in
previous isaac's just being like
incredibly
tanky like you know snoozes not
not my words but other people's words
less discerning customers
this is me
this is a a total inversion
of the of the formula i think he's dead
man
then suddenly the sky above cracked open
and a white beam of light reached down
that's me
smiting the mother of harlots asunder
and setting the blood lake
to a boil as the beast descended down
into the lake of fire
isaac ascended towards the crack in the
sky and as he flew he could see echoes
of his past before him
he saw his mother mourning the loss of
her son
he saw his father leaving them without
turning to say goodbye
he saw his mother sleeping and his
father taking
money from her purse he heard the
late-night
fights they had that kept him up at
night and the guilt he felt for what he
believed he was causing
he felt the pain in his stomach during
those sleepless nights
found himself in a hotel room closet
waiting for him
as he rose he felt his fears drop from
his body
his shame his worry pulled from his
being
as he became lighter his ascent became
faster he saw his one true companion
alive and well he saw his mother and
father together again
holding each other he felt his mother
kissing him on the head after he had
said his prayers
and the comfort in knowing someone was
watching over him
he saw his own birth and the faces of
his parents
filled with joy and optimism
and then he saw nothing
are you sure this is how you want this
story to end isaac
you're the one writing it it doesn't
have to end this way
here sans how about we tell it a
different way
maybe a happy ending okay daddy
good are you getting sleepy yet
yeah okay so
isaac and his parents lived in a small
house on the top
a happy ending they fight they've
revealed the
it was a all a game within a game
that's a nice positive way to kind of
leave it
until until the song
i gotta wait for the the netflix
original series to understand
is this what i sound like when i sing
yeah plus uh i just killed the devil on
easter so
get owned satan
believers win again
well they say h-e-l-l
options question mark
what the what the heck



we've never seen before in isaac
i i have not spoiled myself on you know
what happens with this character at all
or this side of the game at all
it's it's a world first at least in my
world
more options less rooms let's give it a
try
basement one would you like to go to the
store
i don't okay okay hold on
this is not news to me i know what's
going on here i don't know what my hp
looks like but i do know scorpio hey
that's not a bad item
so i think what's happening is that i
would say
more more options less items so we have
here's my guess okay for what we got
going on as uh
as like tainted isaac here my guess is
you can only hold eight items
but in exchange
you get a choice of item on every item
pedestal that seemed because we've
already seen this mechanic with another
item in the past
okay that seems neat and dude i'm just
realizing like we got
the reason we started with no just
chatting today i'm realizing like
you know i'm my stream is not a rib eye
steak right now
you know we we don't have any fat we
don't have any bones like it's pork
tenderloin it's gotta be all meat
now i know what you're gonna say a
ribeye steak is better than
than pork tenderloin you'd absolutely be
correct it's not even
uh close i agree i would much rather
have the ribeye steak
however we got to stay pretty lean here
because you know we've only got
uh five hours on stream three hours for
isaac and
uh about a billion things to unlock
[Laughter]
so let's give it a try
what about beef tenderloin though no i
uh do it honestly like i know beef
tenderloin is maybe the most expensive
cut
i prefer a a cut that has a little bit
of fat on it though
i mean as long as we're talking about
beef like you know tenderloin's great
don't get me wrong
i'd rather have a you know a filet i'd
rather have rib eye
i might honestly even rather have like a
i've really come around to the short rib
lately
you know used to think like you got the
choice between like sweet and sour
chicken or like beef garlic short ribs
when you're at a
an american chinese restaurant
eventually started you know
testing out the beef garlic short ribs
and i'm like wait a minute these are
delicious
i've been i've been missing out well you
know what we don't need to go all path
here yeah freaking steak baby
why'd you do speed honestly can i tell
you why i got on the banter
coefficient and forgot that the items
change uh
and then i just picked it up okay we got
chaos and dad's ring
so here's the thing um dad's ring
is probably better but chaos could be
super cool
when you also consider that we have uh
the double
item pedestal so let's get chaos
no no we hit friction
sonova
[Laughter]
the chaos play hello bear taffy by the
way hello
yo what's up with the library on this
version of isaac
the books do be moving
we definitely just want this
this book doesn't matter please don't
change my
satanic bible on me thank you appreciate
it
easy win good luck
on your runs brother mine were poopoo
dude i
i honestly have nothing to complain
about like yesterday we we had very few
wins but we had like a super win
at the end which has led us to this
situation we find ourselves in
um but we also tried to do like the
hardest things in the game yesterday and
when it doesn't work you're just like
okay fair enough
but my my luck has not been really bad
like dude earlier today i had a bethany
run
where i got let it rip the beyblade item
i had no idea like what it did at all
but it was so good when i figured out
what it did
it creates basically because it has like
a zero room charge on it
it creates like an infinite um amount of
wisps but they go away
as soon as you let go of the space bar
okay both of these i say no to because i
like satanic bible
yeah so if you have rubber banding we've
been through this before but
if you have rubber banding really big
band
here's what you're going to do you're
going to set twitch on
auto instead of setting it on a quality
preset
is that correct chat we've been through
this a few times
or is it vice versa you have it
backwards okay
whatever your stream setting is on
adjust it
how about that if it's on auto put it on
source and if it's on source put it on
auto
and if you're on 1440p
try you know 360.
it'll serve you right i promise by the
way i'm stoked after reaching like peak
covered malaise yesterday
uh i got a beautiful text this morning
at like 7 30 a.m
my parents were like hey
we got our vaccine appointment and it's
tomorrow
and i was like that's poggy woggy
very excited for them
and very excited eventually that i can
rub in their face that they're probably
going to end up getting that astrazeneca
[Laughter]
i'll end up i don't want to flex but
probably with like a johnson and johnson
or something
um okay i think we go dark bum here
no big deal this is a tough choice
though
i love a run that makes you uh it makes
you make tough choices
yeah dark bomb is nerfed but still like
nerf this okay they nerfed this
apparently
dude you know why not uh why not
go with the alt path you know
why not go with the alt path
we don't want to blow those up 10 chance
more pedestals equals more more pog i
couldn't agree more more pedestals
equals more pog
at some point i'm gonna need like a
damage up
but you know we got time
did you actually say poggy woggy to your
parents no but so i didn't say poggy
woggy i'll admit because they wouldn't
know what that means
but i did actually on text chat i typed
let's go with like six o's i think they
can do the math on that one and figure
out what it is
they know what let's go is i'm sure
let's go i was gonna type lfg but i
don't think they know lfg
hey
yeah like the baby i do it look hey man
i was i'm i'm taking some heat for
saying i think that the
the baby meme is uh lazy low effort
insubordinate and shirlish just keep in
mind who was on the
the baby meme last year and everybody
told me to stop pretending to be a
zoomer
every dark souls randomizer tick-tock
death compilation i made
had the song in it you gonna die
you gonna die you know you're like dad
you're embarrassing me
now everyone's like let's go
it's the same thing i i always go son of
a
son i always go back to that uh
tweet i made where like
oh we have a key now thank god uh
everybody gangsta till the memes come
out
no i always go back to the tweet where i
was like um people will actually like
make fun of uh
a little kid for dabbing but they were
doing praise the sun for 10 years yes
hello
okay
just did just the daily diaper news
briefing
leprosy okay that is not what we're
looking for
we're in a we're in a bit of a spice
situation but we do have a 100
devil deal chance we we haven't used
satanic bible yet hold on i gotta think
i gotta think
i like my odds against the uh
bosses more oh never mind
i was gonna say well i was right yeah i
was gonna say i like my odds against the
bosses more than i like my odds against
the enemies but i really wanted to fish
for the charge
all right let's try again you know rome
wasn't built in a day
the great the the easiest marker of a
great isaac player is not their ability
to finesse wins it's their ability to
to let a loss just kind of roll off of
them
it's a marathon
what is the goal the goal is uh is
beating the game
okay tough choice
yeah the goal is uh is is completing the
game if possible
you know i'm gonna i'm gonna respond to
this because you know it's one thing if
you see it show up
20 times in chat on one day it's another
thing altogether
if you see it show up on a second day
that somebody who very much wants their
question answered and i
i respect the tenacity the question is
nl do you watch the olympics the answer
to this question
may surprise you i
um don't uh
it it depends on the time zone right
i'll make time to watch some aspects of
the winter olympics particularly
iced hockey uh summer olympics
maybe mildly controversial i i don't
even get out of bed
if the if the summer olympics were
happening down the street i don't know
if i would even get tickets
okay cool they can run fast like
like i can't imagine like what happens
if you buy
tickets for like the 100 meter dash
right like
are you paying like a thousand dollars
for a race that's 9.6 seconds long
i i feel like you're you're paying just
to say like you know i was here you know
what i mean
they do multiple races on the same day
yeah but nobody's there
like oh if you get a hundred meter dash
tickets guess what like i'm also
throwing the shot put for free nobody
everyone's going to the bathroom during
the shot put section
i went to the summer olympics in sydney
it was pretty fun yo did you see the
thorpedo
ian thorpe with a size 17 feet
i remember essentially one athlete from
from every summer olympics but i will
from 2004
until uh 2000 oh i want i want this
yeah from 2004 until 2016 it was really
easy because you could just say like
uh usain bolt and michael phelps
michael phelps that kind of works right
oh
oh really what about the 1952 finland
olympics
um was the guy from the winter war who
accidentally like
uh boofed all his methamphetamine in one
go and then woke up like
three weeks later in a ditch was he in
there
i feel like he could probably like run a
marathon yeah
the winter soldier bucky barnes
bucky salani
he's a legend look it up i didn't i made
up one part of that he did not
boof the the meth but he did
consume his entire military-supplied
box of methamphetamine in a single dose
and then
you know basically live out jason
statham's like
life from uh crank high voltage i don't
know what this is
and rubber cement is cool but we're
gonna take the new item
oh wait hold on i've seen this in uh in
anti-birth i'm sure
spore tears
when our instant pot carnitas back on
the menu straight up
oh dude that's pretty cool instant pot
carnitas are dead for the time being
um
simply because like we have the lunch uh
deliveries coming instead
and then also like the air fryer has
killed my desire to temporarily use the
instant pot
but right now like my lunches are
handled
so i don't have uh i don't have an
insane
need to use the uh the instant pot
perhaps one day it will revert i do love
to make a nice soup stew
or curry but the air fryer is like is
sick nasty man don't even give me so
don't
even get me started
because you know how this is gonna go
you already know
how this is gonna go you know it's
blowing me away actually and this is not
even like air fryer discourse
um this is old bandage 101 that's not
old man did you fool
there you go somebody in the discord and
you might be here right now it's not
mean-spirited in the slightest
okay i can't follow this i simply cannot
follow this
i think we just take mom's knife even
though it probably ruins our uh
our spore tiers and i think we just
leave and keep our hp somewhat high
um but
not a secret room huh somebody in the
discord
was like i don't even understand why
people preheat their oven
and i was like what are you talking
about and they're like i just put the
food in
like when the uh and i turned the oven
on and i put the food in
immediately and i was
dude we got to stop the muscle memory
because we almost took a tears upgrade
instead of the rune bag here
i would describe myself as as
flabbergasted i think that's oh evp
tom thank you for the gifted
subscription thank you
oh there's a freaking double tinted rock
there man
just add like two minutes to the timer
i'm jealous
oh my god i'm jealous of people who have
uh an oven that heats that fast
because our oven i mean it's a new oven
but
it takes probably 15 minutes to preheat
to like
400 425 450. um
oh yeah we can only hold one more item
i don't know if it's like a difference
between
i don't know it doesn't matter that much
like the thing is i don't really feel
like you're um you're winning
you know by putting your stuff in the
oven
oh we can cycle what item gets taken out
huh well that's an easy choice
um i don't really think you win by
putting
stuff in the oven before it preheats
like don't you just have to add
almost the exact same amount of time to
it in order to get it cooked properly i
mean i get that it's
raising in temperature as you cook it
but like oh
evp tom thank you again thank you it's
less effort
it but it's actually like not though
what do you mean
you're hitting the same amount of
buttons you just you might open the door
one last time
um i don't think we need this i think i
think we're gonna take a little risk i'm
gonna take fake mulligan
that's fine
you have to walk to the kitchen an extra
time you guys are putting your stuff in
the oven and then just leaving it like
unsupervised
is that how i end up seeing all those
pictures where like
the pizza has melted through the rack of
the oven
[Laughter]
and that is like all over the base
that's crazy talk
i yeah i'm i saw somebody in chat i very
much agree with this take
i when i need to start cooking i start
the preheating
and then i start chopping vegetables i
mean i get like with the frozen pizza
it's kind of a different story but
i use the preheat i i group the preheat
time
and the uh preparation time
simultaneously
you know it's it's a lumped task
you sit there for 30 minutes and stare
at the oven no but i stay in the
vicinity you know
just every once in a while i'll turn the
oven light on and then like take a peek
at it
oh out of these two you obviously take
supper
i mean we have to i can't not take
brimstone mom's knife just to see how it
even works in this
oh we've okay and we've dropped supper
hold on
please remove spore tears that
presumably don't do anything for us
right now
or you know you could probably get rid
of tough love
and then give me my supper back okay you
don't get the double pickup well if you
don't get the double pickup then
then get rid of the hp yeah yeah
and then okay we already got rid of that
one all right i understand i understand
so if you remove hp you don't actually
lose the hp you just lose the
the the look of the item that's
extremely good intel
so hp is still very you know precious to
receive
we will purchase a spirit heart black
roon is such a good get too
get rid of old bandage then excuse me
old bandage gives you a chance to get
red hearts
uh we need to buy a bomb uh gives you a
chance to get a red hearts when you
get hit
now just let me we might as well try to
do the full alt path
so just work with me here
we're gonna suck this up
it became a nice damage upgrade we're
gonna use two bombs
mirror mirror i mean i you know you're
gonna you're gonna make me lose my mind
up in here i literally just said we
should do the alt path
and then people were like has he thought
about the mirror is he talking he's
gonna forget about the mirror
like three seconds ago i was like we're
gonna go through the mirror
everybody chill out good lord
i don't want you to miss it
i was talking about this uh
and again this is gonna come across as
bitter but i mean it more as like
relatable
i was talking about it in a youtube
isaac episode and i was like you know
there's some things like i prefer to do
on twitch there's some things i prefer
to do on youtube uh
long isaac episodes 100
i prefer to do on youtube because like
you could be
balls deep in an anecdote like about to
build to the first punch line of the
stream so far
and people people are like tinted rock
and you're like i don't even have any
bombs and they're like yeah i just
didn't i just don't know if you sighed
and i okay just just chill man it's okay
don't worry about it
we're just it's it's not my first rodeo
we got
we got 3 000 hours in this game you
might make the occasional
like the sub optimal play but like just
just slow your roll relax a little yeah
we're still in control
you know like when you backseat drive
like you don't go like oh you should
have taken that turn
at like a slightly different angle
you're like please slow down there's a
guy behind you who's too close
you know you gotta you gotta pick your
moments okay
now i'm thinking i think we get rid of
sport tears they do nothing for us at
the time being
and i'm actually gonna take the evil up
just to give us some more survival for
the time being
yeah you got maximum eight items evp
tom thank you again thank you
yeah we gotta like so i i've gotta think
now the best thing i would love to do
would be to cycle hp upgrades like trade
hp for hp
hp for hp and hp and hp and hp and hp
and so on and so forth
um but we really don't need anything
else right now except
like if i could get rid of
either
like tough love and old bandage can go
and then replace them
with um something that generates spirit
hearts
would be pretty cool that's about it
that's all i got on the on the noggin
right now
if chess was in the olympics who would
be canada's athlete
um it's a tough question i i don't i
don't know canada's top chess player
right now to be honest with you but
um i do know we we would get
you know we wouldn't do very well
it's my guess
not not the worst we got a pretty good
chess uh culture in canada but
you know not as much as like you know
some eastern european and
asian countries and then we also
definitely suffer on the population size
as well
anything can happen but
you know norway russia america
probably be looking at some some very
china some very stiff competition
speaking of which because they're bones
get it
i'm thinking about moving to canada
thoughts um
this comes up now and then i never know
how to answer it right like
i don't know it would are you are you
like a
like a fossil fuel like billionaire or
are you like barely a
making ends meet it makes a pretty big
difference
but i do laugh sometimes people are like
hey i'm thinking of like
uh moving to the country where you've
chosen to live your life
do you recommend it i don't know what
you what are you what are you asking me
to say you expect i'm going to be like
absolutely not
i am bill gates thoughts
i i allow uh bill gates sure
i i'd sign his approval letter i'd be
like sure come on bill
you know what we can now get rid of
safety pin as well we don't want
stranger tractor but we could
we could get rid of safety pin 24-hour
ban
permanent
okay i'm just thinking we're safe for
now
we can only hold eight items you're
gonna have to make some serious serious
plays to get me to take a strange
attractor
what do we got synthol great item very
happy with the swap
let's use awas immediately
and let's just uh we'll just head down
to the next floor yeah we're fine
i don't mind i'd rather get out of the
curse for now
what are your thoughts on on monday
steak
um yeah baby monday steak
baby yeah freaking monday steak baby
uh whatever the day
make it your day f yeah baby
monday effin monday steak
something along those is that what
you're looking for i did watch the video
about 70 times last night
it's just he's got it i and then i
thought i got mouth really good when he
was like i don't see what makes this
video so
like enticing for you and i said oh
right i forgot that's just how people in
ontario talk
oh [__] rights bud [__]
[__] moose head in my muskoka chair
on a long weekend may 2 4 bud [__]
yeah baby
[__] a bud
okay i don't know what this item is but
we will take it
stitches bait and switch
it's an active item okay okay hold on
it's an
active item
what do you do we swap we teleport okay
we hit those let me see what we got here
uh like
neither of the these items are super
good
uh but we definitely oh we
i'm just just looking for a sec just
just give me a moment
tough love does nothing for us i don't
mind swapping it with steam sale
it does very little for us let's put it
that way and then my kind of hope is
that we can use steam sale
and then on a shop
we'll buy some things half price and
then swap to them
i think that would be that would be cool
i also would not mind a new active
like i i would say for the time being i
don't have a a problem
because we didn't have an active to
begin with but this active is not uh
requires maybe a little more uh brain
power than
i consider myself likely to have okay
well we should
work steam sale over to get closer to
spun
and then swap immediately back
i wonder if that'll work i i hope it
does but it may not
sack alter and guppy's eye
i mean sac alters mighty tough obviously
we have some things it could take
but it would also uh like kill us
probably so let's just not and say we
did
um
yeah i think we're gonna just slow our
roll here
cursive of darkness is no joke anymore
guppy's eye allows you to see uh what's
inside of variable outcome
vessels and instruments such as a
a chest or even like seeing which fires
have uh
have spirit hearts in them and i don't
know if you can see like what mushrooms
would have like magic mush or something
like that
it's a good item we're just you know a
little low on hp
okay let's do our yeah let's do our test
we can do that
i don't know if they're gonna let me
teleport here but we'll give it a try
nonetheless
three more cents baby yeah baby freaking
money baby
steak baby rib eye okay sorry
yeah you can choose which item to switch
just by using uh control to
to target
whichever item you feel is lowest yield
you can already fly so it should be a
cakewalk
here we go again
okay
and now what do you think about the
cleaning mode on ovens
i don't know what kind of answer you'd
be looking for here
um
i thought we could get out of the way of
that one um
i'm i'm forum i guess is what i would
say
i mean doesn't it the way i understand
self-cleaning
on an oven is that it just gets like hot
as hell and then when it when it's done
and it cools down you just kind of
scrape the detritus out of it
it burns away all the all the badness
but i do have a i have a question
like i've used it but like when your
oven is
that was not wise when your oven is
dirty
like one of one of the reasons you don't
want it to be dirty
is because when you're cooking the dirt
kind of burns and it gets all like smoky
and stuff right
but like since self cleaning gets so
hot doesn't it cause like an incredible
amount of smoke when you use it
uh i am i am i stuck i'm like
i'm so confused oh okay no no no i
didn't see that
that one tile there there we go
thought we could squeeze yo you take a
full heart huh you're not joking
[Applause]
getting a boneheart would be sick so
here's what i'm thinking
we don't need steam sale for this room
why don't you just
justice me and then give me this bone
heart
and i'm hoping i'm not a 100 percent
confident
oh come on man well there goes the bone
heart
[Laughter]
i was hoping it would let us keep it
after the room but
okay i gotta remember like we just
need to use range knife
like we're totally fine as long as we
just don't
try to get in their face with mom's
knife against enemies we don't
understand
do we lose the tears up we do
i think losing the tears up is fine i'm
just trying to think if there's anything
i'd rather get rid of
and i don't think there is i think we'll
accept that
old bandage you guys are like actually
like i know how this is gonna come
across as like toxic i think you guys
are just wrong
we can have a civil disagreement about
it but like the amount of
hp that you need to do like alt path
wins
is is quite high i feel like you are
incorrect
i mean i was watching and and i know
that there's more people and it's a
different
amount of people as well um or a
different group of people
in general i didn't go through the right
door
um okay you can make fun of me for that
one for sure
well presumably we get to keep the bombs
right um
but i was like watching in dan's chat
like dan was like hey what should i do
like on this shop
and the consensus take was like
unbelievably bad
almost every time like i was losing my
mind
like i can't think of like specific
examples but just like they
dan would walk into a shop and be like
what should i do here and people would
just come up with like
like overly complicated things that were
like a flex
on what they could do but actually were
just like to prove how clever they were
but make their run worse and i was like
what are you what are you doing to my
poor daniel here
why don't you just tell them like like
do a that's it just say do
a don't be like well first you're gonna
buy the dice shard and then
i would consult the wiki on this side
i'm like you guys are losing your minds
just hit it just tell him to buy the map
i'm a firm believer in my own ability
here let me put it that way
i've gotten this far with a seven day uh
backlog
on on back seating
just do a well what i'm doing i'm buying
king baby
just temporarily like in the hopes that
it would get us closer to conjoined
and then um
definitely don't feel like the peeler is
is in our
it's in our world view today a little
bit light on hp
like i'm a firm believer in the idea
that like isaac oh we could just
teleport there maybe
although this guy's not moving oh oh
cause we move him
he doesn't float around by himself or
match our movement we actually place him
okay okay oh plus we can fly
[Laughter]
you're not wrong but i'm a i'm a big
believer in the idea that like isaac by
committee
like just doesn't work and moreover like
you know take offense if you want but i
also think it leads to like
the most boring like smoothed out
possible isaac you could ever ask for
it's not my vibe like it's been fun
don't get me wrong i've had a great time
streaming isaac
um especially like discovering the new
stuff like
there's no like secondary there's no
replacement for that you know like
seeing something new with an audience
for the first time but then there's also
like
like there's been a lot of days where
i'm like thank god
it's over
[Laughter]
just to be honest because i'm like oh my
god like
i would have thought that the uh
that the back seating would be like
better on a game than i played a bunch
because people would be like
hey you know he's played so much of it
we don't need to tell him like he forgot
like a single key back there when he's
already got like 40 keys or something
like that
but it's actually so much worse because
i know what i'm doing that i take it
harder
i think is the the way i would describe
it
okay well let's just do
let's do basic path we'll take the
polaroid
like the back seating like hey you
forgot like this thing is
is warranted i appreciate it
let's try this this will be interesting
but the back seating that's like hey
you know you i know you got 80 cents but
like 10 rooms ago you forgot a penny i'm
like please
stop for both of our sake just
i'm just asking you to just just chill
just be on the level
if we die we die we're playing the game
for a billion years anyway i would don't
worry about it
okay hold on i'm gonna pop alges i keep
i get too close
we get hit by an explosion not a good
vibe
we play wheel of fortune
no i don't think like i mean there's no
antidote to to like backseating i think
i think you basically just have to
choose like how you uh
deal with it as a streamer normally it's
not so bad honestly
because i i feel like a baby like
complaining about it but it really is
like
it's got the vibes like all askew for
the past few days
for sure like the only thing you can
really do is i walked into red poop
oh that hurts the only thing you can
really do
is like um is just start like
you know having like a zero tolerance
policy and i don't want to put the mods
through that when we have like 9 500
people in chat
but we are close like we're we're close
to like all tapping to the discord and
being like
there's a chance or that's true macros
we could put it in uh
we could put it in via emote only mode
aka only vips can talk



we're back checking out more alt path
in case you missed it some common
questions who is this character this is
um
tormented isaac what's up with the
inventory he can only hold eight items
simultaneously
what are you trying to do beat the game
there you go the three most common
questions answered right at the top of a
video
this is not your average youtube video
where you google you know how to do an
outline in photoshop
and then it starts with this 3d art
coming in
off the side of the screen
tilted gamer 913. what's up everybody
thanks so much for all the likes on my
last
tutorial how to click the record button
for saved actions in photoshop today
over the course of this 45 minute
tutorial
we're going to give you a a very brief
and easy way for you to create a one
pixel white stroke
in um why not in uh in photoshop
but first if you could go check out my
uh my gleam campaign if you
if you could go like my post on
instagram
we got a new tutorial up for the patrons
how to enter your credit card number
into patreon if you're
if you're a patron you get access to
that tutorial 24 hours before
the youtube audience you already know
the vibes
well i mean of these pretty easy choice
i don't want to disrespect abel but
we're gonna
we're gonna try some different stuff six
keys already too
i'm familiar with the youtube game you
know i was watching youtube the other
day and there was like um
so the thumbnail i'm not gonna lie it
caught my eye
it said big ed takes another l and
little did i know when i clicked on the
video i would actually
be introduced to a completely new genre
of uh
youtube video evp tom thank you again
um it was clips of the
character slash real person big ed from
90 day fiance
with commentary as well about like how
much he's screwing up or whatever
uh but it was interspersed with this guy
making uh big ed characters
in any game ever made that allows you to
do
custom character creation and then like
showing him like
and look at big ed like he's taking a
fall in tony hawk's pro skater 5 just
like he took a fall on 90 day fiance
and like the video had like like over a
million views
i was losing my mind i was like this guy
is like he's
he's he's found like spider-man and elsa
for gamers
like it's just it's algorithm rocket
fuel
i was impressed i wouldn't say entertain
no
because i was i mean it was honest i
mean i watched 90 day fiance and i like
make fun of the people on it in my head
and occasionally on stream i'll you know
maybe go a step too far and then feel
bad about it but he was like you know
this guy's such a freaking loser and i
was like oh my god
this guy's he's out of his mind he's
going too hard
hey
too far be that as it may
what are your thoughts on jovi from 90
day fiance
you know uh
not positive leave it
at that
seems you know not not ready
um not not taking uh his pregnancy
seriously let's put it that way
or his his fiancee's pregnancy but i
haven't seen that much of this season
i'm just like every time
they show a clip of jovi he's like i'm
at the doctor
and he's holding like a bud light in his
hand at the doctor and i'm like
dude come on just for like two seconds
did you get like a water or something
this is serious
okay we love a tears upgrade
nail only gives half a spear at heart
but it's a nice damage
boost at the same time
being able to fly is also quite nice
i think i will take the nail though and
then on this side i think i take nothing
i think that's the play oh yeah it's
it's been nerfed but you know i mean
half a spirit art is still
especially if you're trying to go alt
path i really think that people are
underrating the the value of hp even
still
and you're gonna make me be a chill
again but i'm like dude honestly
the um any item that generated a
guaranteed spirit heart or demon heart
in six charges was
actually an instant win before uh
that was a weird one so i wouldn't i
don't want to say it's a nerf that's got
me excited
because i do wish that i had that extra
cushion but
they were very strong oh hello
it looks cute to me
the first blue outfit of the baby's life
hello baby
hey
welcome baby blue baby
it's it's perfect it's isaac themed
there you go baby they're not making fun
of you it's a reverential tribute
ahem plus we can step
right i'm trying to think
thoughts on banana pudding what do you
think kate thoughts on banana pudding
yeah same i've said it before i don't
think i've really
consumed much pudding in my life to
begin with
i wouldn't say i've consumed zero but i
think i've consumed close to zero
pudding in my entire life
every time i say it people go like no
you haven't and i'm like
you know like when you're a kid what
goes in your lunch is just like what
your mom or dad decides to put in your
lunch right
they never put snack packs in my lunch
ergo i never uh
i never uh experienced pudding until
you know maybe i've had it for a dessert
when i got a little older but
um
did like i tried some and it did not
taste like
your typical chocolate from chocolate
bar right
okay like more creamy and i thought like
people are weird what do you mean these
people
it's your own your own classmate brought
it in
yeah but they're not korean oh i see
i mean it is weird to bring in chocolate
pudding for the whole class to
class to share she just my friend just
shared one
thing because she's like oh in korea you
don't have this and she thought it would
be like
i see i thought she brought in like an
industrial vat
of uh i mean it sounds like it's gross
either way i don't know i'm getting
painted as the bad guy in this situation
you already said it the first thing you
said when you described it is a big tub
of
the s word which by the way we're trying
to not swear so much so we don't get
demonetized on youtube
no that's mathis he doesn't know what
he's talking about it's really
that's not the rule no all these
youtubers they join like you know these
youtuber discords and then like somebody
hears a rumor that's like it's only the
first 30 seconds
and then they say it in a video and then
all the other youtubers go like they
must be true that guy said it in the
video
um okay hold on we're taking hp of
course
and then all the users get the same
thing the users are like well that
youtuber said it in the video so it must
be true and i'm like that's
source dude just trust me
it might be true though i don't know
ahem
oh baby cucumber
and beef rice goodbye baby
i gotta tell you i think i said this
yesterday i might be repeating myself
cucumber it's one of my favorite
vegetables
i know that it people are like it just
tastes like water and i'm like
yeah i mean we've been through this road
before
but like i i enjoy water
no nutrition oh do you normally pick
your favorite food based on its like
you know composition of phytonutrients i
don't think so you probably pick pizza
like everybody else
i just like i like the texture man
the texture like a cooked cucumber no
thank you but like a raw cucumber
it's delicious i think we're always
going to want to buy spirit hearts
is crunchy water yeah it's why it's deli
it's refreshing
okay we do want key piece this run could
go all the way
i do um i prefer cucumber to zucchini
which is like
again it's a little bit controversial
but i think it's just like i ate
so much cucumber before i ate zucchini
for the first time
that like zucchini tastes like it's
covering cucumber to me
like it's trying to be like hey i was
inspired by cucumber i wrote a little
song for
you and i'm like it's okay but it
doesn't hold a candle to the original
cucumber sandwich not so much no not so
much
there we go i knew what was around here
what are you talking it's just i mean
i'm getting baited probably but what do
you mean they're completely different
look at him are you are you kidding me
what are you talking about it's the same
it's the same vegetable man
they taste a little different for sure
and uh
zucchini much better at being cooked
cucumber does not respond well to heat
it's kind of like me
but apart from that they're the same
vegetable
i will say you could i unlike the coke
pepsi thing
i honestly think that the average person
who's consumed a lot of both
would have like a i would say a 90
chance to differentiate them if they did
a blind taste test
so i'll give you that i don't disagree
on that
100 no the people would get it wrong you
ever see like hell's kitchen like
sometimes they
they feed these people that have worked
in kitchens like their whole lives
they feed them garlic when they're
blindfolded and go like hey what is that
flavor
and like two-thirds of them are like
that's garlic chef
and then like one-third of them are like
i think it's ginger and you're like
like you're a chef and you don't know
what garlic tastes like and you're like
hell's kitchen is the good show like
hell's kitchen is the one for the chefs
that actually know how to cook
they are the you know they're not always
sending their best but it's better than
kitchen nightmares
chef is that chicken and banana have you
gone mad
i did a blind taste test with a friend
and i couldn't identify strawberries
i mean i honestly am of the opinion that
like a blind taste test is
is hard that's why like i want to do
them more on the
on the stream like if oh by the way
thank you for the dna raid
equals face bracket like i i would love
to do a blind taste test because i think
that people are overconfident in their
ability to identify
foods strawberry i will say i'm like you
know come on
but but maybe who knows maybe i'm
overconfident in my ability to identify
strawberry as well
it seems like it should be a pretty
obvious one but
okay here you go we're taking the spirit
heart is nice but i mean when you take
damage you got to take damage
there are some foods i don't doubt that
i could identify with near 100 percent
i'm telling you coke and pepsi like i
know i mean i i guess what i would say
is like i i just disbelieve people
sometimes
like when people are like 100 i could
tell the difference between coke and
pepsi i'm like okay then let's you know
very simple case let's go down to the
grocery store
for two bucks you know and then a
blindfold we can
we can test this empirically for
ourselves
i don't think if you gave me
a 100
like one let me like 100 sample size
coke versus pepsi challenge i do not
believe that i would produce a
statistically
compelling case that i could identify
coke versus pepsi
i think it would be indistinguishable
from like a coin flip for me
it's true i guess you don't need much of
a blindfold they do they do look pretty
similar
they're so different i don't know man
i'm like
you know i kind of feel this is like i'm
gonna take a a a page out of dan's book
and be like you know check give me a y
or n
do you think realistically you could do
the pepsi challenge
and i'm not talking about a one-off i'm
talking about like
you know if i gave it to you 20 times i
don't expect you would go 20 out of 20
but do you think you could do like 18
out of 20
yo oh my pancake thank you for the
gifted subscriptions
no any anybody saying 20 out of 20 like
i actually just
that says more about you as a like on a
psychological level than it does about
your ability to taste
that is a person if i'm doing a job
interview and i ask
this question and you say 20 out of 20
i'm not hiring you to be an actuary
let's put it that way
maybe you can man the cash register
i am an actuary then you should not be
saying 20 out of 20.
you you know about probabilities
yeah exactly heywood would get 20 out of
20. that's why he's stuck in the shelf
i i think i would get like i bet i would
get more than 50
but you know the barrier to actually
producing a convincing result is much
higher than
you know 50 percent
i don't know i i feel like uh
i feel like people are overconfident i
mean i might be wrong
i just feel like people are
overconfident in it i definitely feel
like if you went uh
with a vegetable taste test like
the average person would get
way more wrong than they think
and i'm not even talking about like like
lettuce
and and kale i'm talking about like
you know like radish versus apple
i'm just i'm i'm playing like we don't
have the space here but like
i would love to to do a stream where i
like uh
actually do a blind taste test
i'm not afraid to put my pride on the
line i'm unconfident about my ability to
do as well as people might think in a
blind taste test
simply because i've i feel like i've
watched so many good mythical morning
episodes
where you know they're like oh i think
this is like a grape
and they're like that's not a grape
that's a cherry tomato i think when you
don't have access to your eyes
it's like way harder than you think
the pepsi challenge isn't even close i
drink like
like a diet coke
that's that sucked pretty bad i drink
like a diet coke
every two weeks i have no i don't i
can't remember the last time i
had a pepsi on purpose
okay
i don't know man i i would be interested
that's all i'm saying
i'm not saying you're wrong necessarily
because it's equally fallacious i would
say to assume that
you know i know how you would respond to
the taste of these two
foods you know
you might you know be the you know the
ceo's son or something like that maybe
you're drinking so much cola every day
you've got the most refined
pallet of all time
okay we can dump hp any hp
we got roid rage i can live with that
for the time being
but i think my my hypothesis
on this at least is that
the average person is more
they would do let me rephrase because i
want this to be highly specific
my hypothesis is the average person
would
underperform on a blind taste test
relative to
what they would anticipate they would
get
that's my hunch
i believe the average person would would
think they were better at a blind taste
test than they are
now they might do better at the blind
taste test than i think they would do
but i think they would do that was bad
timing there but
i think they would do worse than they
expect to do
like i just knowing that dan came in and
said said why
for the pepsi challenge i'm like i want
him to do the pepsi challenge
like do it do it on stream i trust dan
by the way like i don't need an arbiter
to be there
i don't think he would be the kind of
person that would be like
you know we're gonna like cheat the
system um
i just want to see him do it oh this was
unfortunate
i'm trying to think about like how i how
i feel about a restock
and i'm not sure how i feel about it i
know it's been nerfed
but i don't know how nerfed it's been
you're right you know we can get rid of
matchbook
just to hold restock for the future
that's a good point see that's good
backseating
okay i'm just trying to think are we
we've already picked that up right
yes it was not good it was a snack we
did not pick it up i was wrong okay
and we're heading down to the next floor
saved saved
save did we go to our item room maybe
not i don't know
it was roid rage what the heck's
happening it was that was your old snack
okay
[Laughter]
sorry i was talking about the pepsi
challenge
we did okay i've been in this room like
10 times that's the old bandage now
or the yeah yeah yeah super bandage all
right
i got it
what was the last boss that's an unfair
question because i don't know the names
of any of these
uh bosses right now
i'm a fool okay take me down yeah rock
larry jr
or the rock diagonal flying guy but i
don't i never knew the diagonal flying
guy
his name to begin with so again that
that doesn't say that much
that's jerry lunier
george glass
no blister please
what's the last boss's birthday i
couldn't tell you unless you told me
what adam sandler movie is their
favorite in which case
i could uh i could figure it out
like the other thing that like if my my
dream style of non-content
is uh not just a blind taste test
but like self reporting what i believe
my favorite fast food chicken nuggets
are
and then taking a blind taste test of
every fast food chains
chicken nuggets and seeing if my actual
perception
lines up with my experience okay
now now we're cruising
like i'm not afraid to find out that my
brain has been lying to itself
i think that i prefer mcdonald's chicken
nuggets
to burger king chicken nuggets
but you know when i taste them and when
i when i dip them in a sauce
maybe maybe it'll activate the different
sections of my brain you know
am i actually you know experiencing the
flavor when i think of what my favorite
chicken nugget is or am i just telling
myself like i'm recalling that i said
mcdonald's chicken nuggets are my
favorite so i gotta that's what
that's my answer
i gotta be honest with you techx uh
damage nothing to write home about just
yet
my grandma's homemade chicken nuggets
are the best
like i'm just gonna be honest with you i
doubt it
like if i put your grandma's chicken
nuggets up against mcdonald's chicken
nuggets
i bet i would prefer the mcdonald's
chicken nuggets
even having not tasted your grandmas i'm
willing to take a
take that bet for sure
yo this is pretty sick okay we got a
heck of a run here we can also suck up
all the passives we don't want for
actives which is incredible
oh no his his his grandma's grimace
no no
i don't know like to be honest
there's homemade food that tastes better
than store-bought food
no doubt about it however
there's some things where i'm like you
know if you want chicken nuggets
i don't i don't want my my grandma to be
like dredging
chicken thighs in in flour and putting
them in the deep fryer and stuff like
that i just
i want the paste man just give me the
paste
sometimes you just want the paste
it's the same with burgers you know like
every once in a while a homemade burger
for sure
it hits the spot but sometimes you're
like i just want like a
a beef patty that's like as thin as a
fingernail
and i want like whatever the mcdonald's
seasoning packages
you can make the paste at home with the
food processor i honestly don't know if
i have the stomach
don't you have to put like beaks in
there
this is not a bad faith bit i i take the
the fake uh concern trolling is bad
faith quite honestly
people are like is he okay sometimes you
want a homemade burger
sometimes you want like a like the fast
food garbage
they occupy two different spots on the
star chart for food
could a boomer do that i don't think so
chat's all like when i grow up i'll
never eat fast food
bro let me tell you like a dirty little
secret about adulthood
when you grow up based on like just like
the
us census like i mean there's adults i
know that eat fast food like six times a
week if anything you're probably going
to eat it more because you
you got things going on in your life
that suck up more time
i'm not saying you should in fact i'm
saying
you shouldn't but it does happen
that's just you just gotta accept that
you just gotta take that one
yeah don't be rude to apollo he doesn't
eat fast food
there's and this it might sound like i'm
being i'm trying to make a joke of your
expense apollo
there is a difference between delivery
and fast food you can get a little bit
of both
obviously the delivery food is probably
not as healthy as the homemade version
but you know there's a difference
between like getting an acai bowl and
getting like a
you know a big mac
i'm saying i know people that go through
the drive through like six times a week
okay hold on yeah yeah suck it up
now we're talking by the battery charge
apollo i appreciate you being the
guardian of chat by the way
i always enjoy having more streamers in
here
it just i feel these kindred spirits
the higher one streamer being in the
chat like
yeah thank you as well jay one one
verified streamer at the chat
actually provides like a thousand
viewers worth of desalination
so we got we got dan jay and apollo
at least temporarily they would they've
been here
we need six or so we need eight more
streamers
you know it's a quality problem to have
i suppose
i think we want actives i think we want
unlimited actives
my nearest mcdonald's is 50 kilometers
away okay that's look acceptable
but all i'm gonna say is i'm if i go
through your chat history
and inside of your chat history is a
bunch of comments like i never eat fast
food
then 24-hour ban
permanent because you got to bake that
part into the you know assumption
if you don't if you don't have the means
to to travel like on your own
you know go to a restaurant or something
like that and you're like i never eat
fast food it's not that hard i'm like
you know
still spiky spiky don't likey
i'm like yeah if you gotta ask your mom
to drive you to wendy's you're probably
not gonna go to wendy's as often
as if you've only got yourself to blame
help
there's no fast food places in your town
honestly that's pretty sick
i mean like i'm i would prefer if there
were some
fast food places in my town but the idea
that you live in a place that has
no fast food whatsoever is kind of it's
interesting to me
was this was this by design from the
town
like did they did they institute some
kind of policy or something
oh my god plan c is going to screw this
whole thing up for us huh because i
can't suck up all these items now that i
got plan c
uh i've decided i'll keep tech x
[Laughter]
hold on and probably keep the nuns habit
as well
at this point where are we go gahanna
won
i don't mind getting rid of the the
steam or restock for now to hold nuns
habit because we do generate
spirit hearts off of it
okay
plan c got buffed yeah it's
you know it's one of these days you know
like on
on a low impact run sure this one
it's a little spice plus like just
because things are
better now doesn't mean they're not
still
trash you know
like the new rebecca black friday remix
the hyper pop version like it's better
than the original friday
it's still really bad
it recently got buffed but
it still sucks like a big in a big way
yeah new justice league just got buffed
i mean i got nothing
look i'm not if if you're i feel like we
should be more optimistic about
um dude what if we just suck up
the items like that's so risky but hear
me out i i think we should be more
positive about
uh the justice league
the man's a genius because
and i just give it a moment here
nobody really liked the first version of
the justice league
they had a chance to get up in the
undercarriage
they got up in the undercarriage what
happened they made a better version
everybody should be stoked
i don't it's not my cup of tea but i
think it's still cool that they got to
they got to make the movie they were
going to see
or they wanted to see i should say
i don't need to dunk on it i mean it is
four hours long like
i can't do more damage to the community
than they've already done it themselves
just by
watching it
sorry sorry um
you know what i mean
i'm trying to delete it freaking monday
baby freaking steak monday zach monday
baby
freaking superman batman wonder woman
cyborg monday baby
frick yeah
a tears upgrade or a tears upgrade i
choose to take a tears upgrade um
nuns have is really good dude we could
get rid of the speed range
okay headed down to the next floor i did
see that there was a
uh there's a 20 hour
cut of uh once upon a time in hollywood
like that's a little absurd
again like you know you like what you
like
i i enjoyed once upon a time in
hollywood the first time i saw it
and then it had to sit with me a little
longer until i realized that i actually
liked it quite a bit
first i was like it's kind of like is a
fun slice of life
but i don't really understand like
what's the point then i watched it again
on hbo like six months later and i was
like you know what i actually think i
like this movie a lot the movie's just
like a vibe
and then like some slapstick at the end
but uh 20 hours no thank you like i
think
about three hours of it was enough for
me
two times
i wanna do just suck up all these items
you think the dearth of film releases in
the uh
last 16 months has been noticeable
depends what you mean i suppose
noticeable
yeah like in the sense that uh
like i've noticed
like has it had like a demonstrably
negative effect on my life no not really
i think
i think because the thing is like it's
it's gonna like pay dividends
speed down huh it's going to pay
dividends uh
later because all these movies it's not
like they go bad
unless it would be funny in in some way
at least
uh and not in others if a movie had like
taken so long to come out it had
actually aged poorly by the time it was
released
not just in terms of cgi but in in terms
of the you know
cultural norms
like i imagine if you were making a a
comedy movie about some kind of like an
infectious disease
admittedly kind of a uh unlikely uh film
but i imagine probably it's not in a
great spot for you right now you're like
ooh
just gonna wait wait for this all to
blow over so that my uh
my gross out pandemic comedy comes out
in the right kind of climate
okay well i mean like blankets pretty
sick
even just to get the spirit hearts for
now
and then converter is pretty good but i
don't want to suck it up
i want to buy it or we don't have any
money
i would have but i didn't have any money
i mean i think that the nuns have it is
of extreme importance i'll
i'll give up a little play there and
then
suck this up like so then get another
battery charge
and then buy this
ouch
are you gonna read dr disrespect's um
autobiography don't be ridiculous
it's 2021 i'm going to get it on audible
who reads
stupid it's a dumb question
oh no you didn't you see the message
deleted message deleted message delete
i just think it's funny
hold on permit card no thank you i'm
really looking for some batteries
i've taken some bad damage
no question about that yeah move on is
doing the lord's work
it goes
yeah i i have an internal bluetooth
headset uh
when i met elon at the filming of joe
rogan's podcast he hit me with a brain
implant on the house it's pretty shocked
me a couple of times but for the most
part it's been pretty good
um and one of the big things about it is
that it uh
converts everything i read into
text-to-speech in my head
so it's uh that's that's why i'm like i
just wish chat would slow down because
it's actually like i feel like professor
xavier right now in more ways than one
check this out they won't teach you this
at jay's channel
okay this is mausoleum mom right
fighting the boss mom and the mausoleum
what's the other reason one reason is
obvious bald
the other reason is um
that if you haven't seen the x-men
movies in a while
professor xavier builds a machine called
cerebro
that uh amplifies the thoughts of people
in the real world
so he can search for them and find more
mutants for his mutant academy
and and that's how i feel right now with
the text the elon's text to speech
neuro link going on in my brain right
now
is it really called that have you not
seen
x-men i mean you should watch x
x-men and x-2 like those are those are
really good movies
i mean by superhero standards at least
x3 no you don't is it's so easy dude you
watch
it's called the machete order okay you
watch x-men
x2 skip x 3 the last stand it's a
complete piece of garbage
um watch x-men first class
watch days of future past skip
x-men apocalypse and skip dark phoenix
there you go the machete order
and logan yeah okay watch logan logan's
really good
and then you can you can also watch
deadpool 1 and 2 but
but not x-men origins wolverine
dude this is not so hard like
get me out but you i had the right idea
you got to admit
that what the heck is that dude
i'm i'm sweating
papa technology now i'm sweating we have
so many tears upgrades
something's got to give okay we either
get rid of a tears upgrade because i'm
not using my maximum rate of fire anyway
or
we use our maximum rate of fire those
those are our two options i don't think
we should be tap
shooting to be clear but i think we
should shoot a little faster
there was a tinted rock in this room
okay
you know what you're absolutely right
thank you that's quality backseating
it's even a double tinted rock
easy choice okay now we can't get rid of
nun's habit i actually think we get rid
of
one of our tears upgrades
nun's habit is is pretty valuable for us
right now
get rid of the mulligan you're crazy man
you're freaking crazy
i love you but you're crazy
you're not wrong shots shot speed down
might be a positive for us maybe we get
rid of the screw instead
it's worth giving it a try
or the soap for that matter
old school from 2003 that's true
speaking of movies that haven't aged
well
that being said i i refuse to be taking
the task for enjoying the movie old
school
i saw it in theaters when i was 13 years
old and i laughed
like blame the adults who made the movie
it's not my fault it's baked into my
nostalgia as hilarious
okay hold on sir does serpent's kiss
still generate
demon hearts it doesn't spawn
demon hearts anymore what okay i'm
giving up another tears plus shot speed
just to take the stapler
only if you do contact damage
f heavy f energy
plus 0.83 damage i got to be honest with
you you got me rethinking this
but i i do feel like our damage has
improved but these might just be weaker
enemies
you're not wrong the guy who directed
old school did also direct
joker
i actually saw i saw the uh
the last 20 minutes of joker on tv today
when i was you know hanging out with the
baby
and i was watching you know the scene
where uh
you know he's at the late night show and
i was like uh you know that
i didn't really like joker that much but
he's like chewing up scenery and
you know it's kind of fun to watch at
least and then he was like uh yo what do
you get when you
cross uh mentally ill loner with a
society
and i was like oh right uh uh change the
channel really quick we put on bloomberg
news real quick
he's done it
and look away look away
it reminds me of when i saw joker with
my friend we missed the first hour
uh you know i wouldn't say you missed it
you know like in um
the first naked gun movie where like o.j
simpson
uh who was unproblematic at the time
uh tries to raid the drug deal
but instead he just constantly ends up
like pratt falling backwards like and
then he puts his hand on like wet pain
and he's like
ah and then he like steps on a mouse
trap
that's basically what the first hour of
joker is like except with like hurt
feelings
it's like he's like i love me and then
people are like oh no lol wait you were
serious
there i just i saved you 60 minutes
i gotta see this now hey man look i'm
not
super like anti-joker like mostly
because i'm anti-joker but like a lot of
people really loved it and i know what's
good for me i don't want to cause any
problems
for myself you know i already got enough
going on with the back seating as
previously mentioned
um but if you're talking about the naked
gun
yeah you should see the the naked gun
like that's a great movie
i do need to uh point out
it does hypothetically star
a murderer but
oj is not in it like that much
he's he's pretty important for the start
of it
but then quickly you will realize why
his role is diminished
later in the film
allegedly yeah yeah exactly allegedly
he was proven innocent well
i mean that's not how court works you
know
he wasn't proven guilty criminally
but he was held civilly liable which is
kind of like
you know
[Laughter]
it's like we can't quite pin it on you
but if it were up to me
you'd be taking the rap for this one
no oj's lawyer is not on the phone cause
johnny cochran died like
15 years ago
i mean i don't know enough about the oj
trial to the comment on it but i
you know i mean what can i say dude dude
what could i do the glove didn't fit
dude what am i supposed to do
you heard him
let me out
it was the inspiration for the chewbacca
defense yes
correct
hey n.l i think my parakeet might be
obsessed with you
why are you so obsessed with me
constantly texting me
you're a parakeet corpse xl this sucks
really bad
we're going to die
on the other hand maybe that's what it
takes to truly
know what it means to live
damn damn didn't ask didn't
ask didn't ask i felt like i was in like
a zero g
turn there just showed him
that was intense man hp you gotta give
me hp
okay one heart final boss

oh papa yes yes and the other do it for
you might
i i have seen the video where the guy
eats the wasps nest
i haven't thought about that one for a
while
no we did we talked about that one on a
stream
when it was contemporaneous you know i
also watched the full video today
of um your flat you got no talent etc
etc is so good
how does the the the angry man maintain
such an unbelievable string of dialogue
improvisationally like the things that
he says are
are of staggering like i wouldn't say
merit but just
the construction of the sentence is so
impressive
he's like you're not an artist you got
no respect
a real artist
i mean let's be honest we were toasted
but he's like
a real artist has respect for the
silence that serves
as the foundation of creativity
and i'm like this guy is like losing his
mind he's so angry
but it's provided him with like laser
focus
for what he's saying
it's it's insane he's like
i'm an nyu a film school graduate
san francisco academy of arts
i watched bob dylan i walked him out on
stage in 1975.
who are you you're everything wrong with
society
you got no talent if you got talent
go go rent a studio and practice
it's like it's it's madness man
yo thank you thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
why do you sound so much like him i
don't know man i just watched the video
it's one of the most important pieces of
architecture in north america
okay did i slash them



do the same thing
but don't go out pat this time let's
just get some momentum
let's get some momentum
why am i crying in the club right now
cause you got no talent
you're you're not an artist an artist
respects the silence that serves as the
foundation of creativity
i toured with the grateful dead in san
francisco in 1971.
you're nothing like them like it's i
don't know how
he he's able to string together this
this coherent screed over and over
you watch the video you're going to be
like this guy is
that impression is pretty good
yo dope francis 2 30 thank you as well
for the gifted subscriptions thank you
you know let's just say you love to see
it
suppose hypothetically you love to see
it
yeah i don't know what the video was
called but if you just type because this
is how i found it if you just type into
google you're flat you have no talent
i believe the video was called something
like weird angry man in new york city
i and you know the older i get like the
more i find myself actually like a
little bit
um jealous in some way of the angry man
because when i get angry i just end up
being like
oh yeah like i just do that but his his
argument becomes more clear and
clarified
the angrier he gets
which is you know i don't think he's
using it for good but it is kind of a
superpower
oh look you're doing right now yeah
okay well that'll come in handy uh
eventually
yeah he's like the the argumentative
hulk
okay there you go that's that's high
octane
i think that's a video dan would love
i also i mean every once in a while like
dan and i i don't have any like
group texts or anything like that but i
i treat my conversations with daniel as
if i have group texts from time to time
so i i saw a funny video of a guy
getting knocked out by a grand theft
auto style punch outside a burrito place
in los angeles
and i was like come on man i got to show
this to somebody
so i showed it to dan and you know i
think we're kindred
spirits there
yahoo
i saw that video i mean he really
like he gets hit by a single punch
and he just folds like his legs just
like
he he folds like a binder like it's it's
crazy
nice try buddy
me irl hmm
yeah i'd rather have the damage i've
decided after one second of thought
um i guess we should go see the card
otherwise that one guy is gonna lose his
mind
it's up here up in here up in here
y'all gonna make me get the world up in
here
up in here y'all gonna make me
buy a key
up in here up in here y'all gonna make
me smelt my trinkets
up in here up in here
yes
by the way i want you to know um
dreamcatcher shows you the boss
and the item room that you're gonna get
on the next floor
in the interstitial cutscene
between the two floors i wanna bring
that up specifically for the guy in the
youtube comments who
on my first run ever seeing dreamcatcher
i
didn't know what it did somebody in the
comments told me what it did
and then somebody replied and got 150
likes
and said oh so he'll never figure out
what it does
like you're doing right now like you're
doing right now
anyway sorry i i shouldn't have taken
the alt path but i do love
dub items i got i've got an itch and the
only cure is dub
items huh huh like you do it right now
charge baby no thank you
sure showed him i don't even need to
show him he doesn't even have an avatar
thanks for enjoying my content for seven
years you d-hole
okay now i gotta tell you this
invincibility
is probably what i'm looking for even
more so than trinket smelter
i'm gonna take it i'm gonna take it
default avatar guys are the best posters
look i'm gonna get in trouble for this
but i've noticed whenever i've tweeted
anything about kovid
everybody who calls me stupid because
like i
believe in science uh their avatar is a
picture of their dog
i don't know if anybody else has noticed
this phenomenon
but like i've i've gotten to the point
where i almost have like a little ptsd
if somebody
if somebody replies to me and their
avatar is a picture of their dog i'm
like already wincing before the words
even
enter my brain
i wish it weren't the case i'd like i
who doesn't like dogs right
i just finished the video and your
impression was so good oh thank you i
appreciate it thank you
speed upgrade baby speed no speed
upgrade baby freaking monday baby no
speed upgrade baby
no smell no smell required
i mean it could be a picture of somebody
else's dog like i'll tell you it's not
fair okay because like i'm sure there's
great people
that don't want to use their own face or
a cartoon version of it uh as their
avatar i understand
but i implore you like to some extent
if your if your
twitter avatar is a photo of
your dog or
you in a truck or your truck or car
or you holding a fish
the quality of your discourse
better be awesome because like i'm i'm
i'm not saying you shouldn't
be having that as your avatar that's
your right
i'm just saying like i get a
disproportionate amount of negativity
from that kind of avatar
and i don't even tweet controversial
stuff
yeah if you're like a normal person that
loves fishing i feel bad for you
because i feel like you know the a lot
of the
the the fish guys are ruining for
everyone else like dick hammer he loves
to fish
uh yeah i'll probably go with the
pentagram on this one
my twitter picture is my dog and i'm the
person who sent you the upside down
sausage video
okay you know what you're you're good
can i ask you another question is your
dog a boxer
and i don't mean like like logan paul
because i i have noticed and it's not
the dog's faults
but a lot of the negativity also seems
to come from the
the boxer photos i've known some
some amazing boxer dogs in my life
it's just something i've i've noticed it
doesn't mean it's causative
it's just a correlation but
my avatar is my boxers i mean that might
be fine
i've never really had a problem with
with the
i mean like here's the thing the horny
twitter accounts
the worst they're going to do is is kind
of you know
skis me out right i don't i i'm an adult
i can get over that
i've never had someone with like the you
know 18 plus thing in their twitter
handle tweet me and be like i hate you
i was telling this is it this is an
ancient story i've told it a couple of
times
but like in 2014
kate and i took a trip to san francisco
and i didn't wear sunscreen
so i got a nasty sunburn on my head
and it also for anybody who wears
glasses they know like if you get a uh
if you get a sunburn or a tan while you
have your glasses on
you get like a pale glasses
outline where your glasses are right
so it looks kind of funny so kate took a
photo of it
and then posted it on twitter and was
like lol like look at
the sunburn on my husband's head and to
this day i've still been trying to
figure it out
but we got like a bunch of tweets from
from people that i
follow like people that i know
at least them acquaintances of in the
industry that are like
lol i know what those marks are don't
worry you two your secret is safe with
me
and i'm like i don't know like so many
people
left that style of comment and i and
we were like no it's a sunburn and
they're like yeah okay
i still to this day have no idea
what they were talking about
i i brought it up in the other uh
in in the discord with justin and corey
and justin was like is there some kind
of like horny lamp i don't know about
and i was like that's where i'm at
i have no idea
i still i still have no clue what it
could possibly have been
that they thought
 mask but i don't even know like
how would that give me a glasses mark
on my head
i would like to apologize on behalf of
all dog profile pictures
hey here's the thing because you are
apologizing it means you don't have to
apologize
maybe you were wearing the mask on
the beach like that's the thing it
required i gotta go through like so many
hoops just to figure out like
it's a mark it's a heat rash
but your glasses saved the purity of the
skin
under the under the frames what
it's basically just like a bunch of
people that i never
in my life wanted to know like you know
what
what they're doing in that avenue of
their life we're like by the way
we're into some some stuff that's a
little unusual which is fine but i'm
like oh why you
why are you telling on yourself just
because i got a sunburn dude yo
brimstone
a parasite look at that
that's pretty cool i'm hip i'm with it
okay no alt path anymore
i don't think it's that useful but still
yeah it it that's an amazing way to
describe it
it involves far too many layers of horny
math
like it's not one operation it's like 10
different operations like oh you were
wearing
a mask made out of leather
and then also like getting hit with the
riding crop or something like that it's
it's too many there's too many damn
pages for any sane man to understand
i don't i don't have a degree in in
erotic calculus like i don't understand
to this day i'm still just confused i'm
not
offended but i'm just like i swear to
you
i promise i don't know what you're
talking about which i know is in there
like yeah i
bad wink wink and i'm like no please
like don't put me in the group chat
because i
i'm you know i'm like a double agent
i don't think they were trolling me this
is before trolling existed
honestly i feel like i explode all the
time give me give me one of these host
hats man
i get the picture host hat you were
wearing a host hat
and then engaging in water sports
help
i got nothing
i was just like i mean it wasn't it
can't be
here's the the problem okay it can't be
that specific
of like a horny thing because more than
one person
replied and was like wink wink
so either a lot of people are into some
very
specific corny stuff which i suppose
could be true or it's like a
base level like entry degree of
horniness but they're just
mighty confused like i i don't even know
what they're doing but i think they
might be doing it wrong
hold on i can leave yeah cause i'm just
it's just a normal run i can leave
it's a bit bro like you're sunburned but
it looks like a hickey
but like no this is like it was the
glasses marker
it's like i it's like i got a hickey
on on my on my ears but like in the
shape of my
exact glasses i don't know man it's just
it's just weird people are people are
too shameless these days
back in my day i grew up in a little
town maybe you've heard of it it's
called pleasantville
we didn't talk about those things
maybe clamps people putting clamps on
the sides of their head
it was really dangerous man
like on their temple
that just seems reckless that's like
something out of the cell dude
bet they thought you had a ball gag on
i'm sorry i couldn't
complete the sentence without laughing
because i was like i was just imagining
having two ball gags on your eyeballs
and you would look like whoa
[Laughter]
thank you thank you kate i'll check the
oh no not for me but i appreciate the
the the check okay do you remember this
i'm talking about how like when we were
in san francisco i got that uh
sunburn and you tweeted a photo of it
and then a bunch of people replied to us
and we're like
you know i get what's going on there you
can't
get one by me and we were just like i
have no idea what the heck they're
talking about
bounty alert no it's i checked i don't i
don't have one but i do appreciate it
perfection luck way up don't lose it
okay we'll roll that for now
i'm gonna leave that for just a moment
maybe they thought you were just a
big old uh you know what for the sun
that's a good way to
i do like the sun my mood has improved
greatly
um since daylight savings man i know
i've said it a few times but
did you go to the devil deal no i was
still i was too busy
trying to figure out what what like
doing the horny sherlock holmes bit
donkey dunk dunk dun dun
little freak i know what you're into you
freaking sicko
put your glasses inside the microwave
and then put them on
would your glasses melt if you put them
in the microwave probably
i no i'm not gonna try it i can't
uh nuke these glasses it'll be like that
twilight zone episode
because i can't go to the optometrist
until the freaking vaccines are out man
it's like if i lose my glasses i'm i'm
stuck
well thankfully i've got these
prescription ball gags
with oh i get what you're talking about
yeah yo
you're a sick freak you like to go out
in the sun and wear your glasses
you're you're bad you're naughty
i thought you were like pretty straight
lace turns out you like to
occasionally go outside without taking
the necessary precautions and then
you know you get a sunburn on your head
you oh you're a
you're a bad boy
freaking sicko freaking
freaking sexy blind egg
anyway just it's something that's
haunted me forever
there is a bit there hold on do we even
want any of this
i would say no neither of these matter
the bit is like they're into like
you know oh you didn't oh you tell me
you oh my god you did it without
protection
not even like an spf 15 or anything
you're so bad
it's like there's it's there's no
barrier between the sun's harmful rays
and like my delicate skin it's like
they're
they're right in contact with one
another
okay hold on i'm sorry in some ways
uh i dude i can't i can get rid of
explosion immunity
for infestation too no i'd rather get
rid of this
light bulb for infestation too
oh but now i can't see
[Laughter]
oh well
the bit was brilliant and horrifying i'm
just glad we finally got like a single
joke done
been a long stream with like no jokes i
wonder if we'll keep the bone hard we'll
keep the bone heart probably we keep the
bone hard
we lose the tears upgrade but no big
deal actually a huge
problem but we got the hp anyway from
supper so no big deal
the devil deal still open wow chat
wow bet you're happy now
actually lump of cold could be pretty
sick here
well the world may never know
why can he only hold eight items you
guys ever see the
um mr show sketch the pre-taped collins
show
missed flight irish spring green green
green green green
no uh no reason
honestly i've i've been a proponent for
a long time of the idea that flight is
actually not a good item
it's overrated it breeds bad habits
i trolled you
get trolled by the master king of the
slams
nope maybe we'll see i mean
i feel like when you when you can only
hold eight items
a uh
a re-roll room like that is pretty
terrible like even worse than usual
okay hold on hold on hold on hold on
this is this is actually sick dude
so prayer card something don't get me
wrong but uh
you get rid of your speed upgrade you
take brittle bones
you then walk into some spikes
like just take some damage to get a
little tears upgrade
do we have red hearts we can't get in
there just give it a sec
just just hear me out on this one we do
need some red hearts to make this work
take prayer card oh man this guy's
living in the past you hate to see it
okay he's gonna be mighty upset in a
couple of minutes
oh dude oh it didn't work there
red hearts please red hearts i think i'm
happy to go back
now we lost two we got a sizable well
we got a decent tears upgrade
and now where's your headroom at the air
cam's a little droopy
i had to uh i had to raise my chair
because honestly the way i was sitting
i'm just being real with you like the
way i've
been playing isaac
my elbows hurt by the end of a stream
which i know is kind of a weird thing
to say but like i'm putting
too much pressure on my elbows when i
play on keyboard and mouse
so i had to raise my chair and as a
result the top of my head gets a little
chopped off by the
the webcam but we'll uh we'll adjust
you know what i'm talking about
it goes it goes
okay here we go not at all
uh it's it's called um
the arcade fire sweetheart look it up
uh that's pretty good we will be taking
this
amazing arcade fire cover there i could
i could make it go longer if you wanted
me to
oh
again again
we're good um because somebody's gotta
sing the fifth
huh okay sorry
encore encore looking for a city you
will
will never die when the city millions
never say goodbye
my grandma's in the next room yo you're
making chicken nuggets over there
yeah yeah yeah
good call back thank you thank you
appreciate it try to have a few
every stream on our shows
excuse me i should still get my tears
upgrades there in my opinion
this would have been very helpful a room
ago
more songs please
oh item rooms i forgot we smelled did
that thing like 10 years ago
um i do i love to sing
songs man all the time
who doesn't right
one of my favorite songs i sing it to
the baby all the time
it has no words i think it goes
it's pretty good i would recommend it
it's a classic
um i'm gonna be honest with you for
considering what we have right now i
don't think we want any of these
and then you know all night every night
i'm just going uh
you're not wrong one of my favorite
parts of a mexican restaurant is fresh
tortilla chips
i really think like a hot tortilla chip
is like
it's just the best like what else can
you say right
it just a hot salt just tastes good and
then if you get a little lime juice on
there as well
and the damage is not as poggy woggy as
i thought it would be
yeah i bet if you heated up doritos
you'd probably they'd i bet they'd taste
even better as long as you didn't
make them soggy
if you just like if you put doritos in
the oven for like a
on 200 for like five minutes i bet
they'd be freaking
delicious man
use a book of shadows on the demon
judgment thanks i'd never considered
that
uh possibility before
so is this a new mechanic did they just
add this into the game
this must be this must be new i've never
seen this
yo yo you can do this
i want neither judge
okay what's your secret for this one
how's the back seating going it's fine
i've just chosen to be the bigger man
and
not get mad about it and instead just be
very passive aggressive when people are
trying to help
but i think it like to some extent it's
justified because like some of this
stuff is basically like hey
you know use your diaphragm muscles to
like inspire
and respire and i'm like yeah i got it
don't worry i've been doing it for years
don't sweat it the vibes have improved
from the first run
no doubt about it but it takes like
honestly again
you know i know i've used this metaphor
a few times before but it is from one of
the eminent
creative works of our time you know like
when thor uses his muscle mass to hold
open the forge
of the dying neutron star in infinity
war
um void's tempting
how do we even take it i don't know man
i don't even know
i mean it's probably good but anyway
like i feel pretty confident here let's
just not throw a monkey wrench into it
but that's how i feel like trying to
maintain banter
when there's also like uh
i mean literally like 5 000 comments
about like
you know missing a key or something like
that or like consider using your tears
to shoot enemies in the face
i'm like i'm like captain america in in
civil war
like holding on to the
rudder of the helicopter to to get it to
like not take off
i'm like we're talking about chain
pizzas right now i
hey did you go go go to the item room
i'm do and like the veins are bursting
but instead of bursting out of my arm
they're like bursting out of my forehead
like
you know what i'm talking about this guy
definitely knows what i'm talking about
your forehead is not as buff i apologize
you you don't have to apologize for
being wrong i got one of the
probably one of the strongest foreheads
in the game
look at this thing dude
no online casino on earth has enough
money to pay for this kind of real
estate
press spacebar to use your active item
but what
when you say press you mean like
like like a journalist right like a like
a tv reporter or something like that
how am i supposed to get a a journalist
to look at my
space bar and what's that gonna do for
me oh you you want me to use the tendons
in the in my fingers and and hand to do
it but like
but hold on though oh i thought this
would work
i mean we're going to take it anyway but
get rid of host half for now i thought
this would do like a cool
parasite move if we're well we're going
to stick with this we might as well get
rid of the parasite yes
that's a valid point that's a valid
point
keep moving up
maybe when you hit something that's true
maybe when you hit something
but how am i supposed to use the tendons
in my finger and and hand in order to
do this you want me to send out a signal
from my brain
but how oh you want me to to shoot an
action potential down the axon thus uh
opening the potassium and uh sodium
channels
where do i get the potassium and the
sodium from though
oh ingesting like like eating matter
okay i just ate a rock
i i don't feel any better oh food all
right
okay okay i mean we could just keep this
going forever but
keep it moving keep it moving
bananas dipped in salt mmm the
patrician's choice
it is saucy i was talking about it in an
isaac episode today um
because that's all we're recording right
now i was like i i have a hunch okay
and it it's steeped in economic theory
so i apologize for this
i think you always get a dilemma at a
barbecue
which is do you want a hamburger or a
hot dog
i posit the theory that a hamburger is
better than a hot dog
but because your opportunities to eat
hot dogs are in my experience at least
much rarer than my opportunities to eat
hot dogs
i find myself more likely to select a
hot dog
simply because of the artificial
scarcity
i can get a hamburger anywhere a hot dog
is like a
it's not a rare occurrence but it's much
less in abundance than a hamburger i
would say
just get one of each i don't know what
kind of barbecues you guys are going to
it's a pandemic
oh no what have i done i've swapped too
many items around
no this is actually completely fine
because we don't care about sad bombs
give me that
one of each is the standard not not in
not in this neck of the woods in this
neck of the woods
you could get one and then maybe 15
minutes later you could try your luck
and get another one
if you went up to the grill master and
you were like hey give me one of each
he'd probably tell you to sit your ass
down he'd be like come on man there's a
big line
like why do you get to get two things
before everybody else has even had one
i don't i don't buy the question marks
everybody gets one before anybody gets
two
and people say i don't talk about my
political beliefs on the show
i don't think so
that is we're treating vaccine
management here too you're not wrong
which i think is trust the
epidemiologists on that one but
especially because it gets me my first
shot a little faster but
okay
how's canada's economy doing i gotta be
honest with you like it
i don't want to say it's doing too good
but the canadian dollar is too high
right now versus the american dollar
it's harming our ability to export
i don't know i mean i have such a
rudimentary knowledge of like macro
economics i don't really know how like
the dollar value of a currency relates
to the strength of the economy but
that's all i got yeah we're at like 80
cents man it was like 68 cents last year
all i'm saying is ed you couldn't you
couldn't have just released
repentance a year earlier huh and maybe
like in november
instead the ad rates man
i'm starting to think edmund had no
consideration of youtube cpms
when he when he came out with this game
like he didn't even ask man like hey
what's the best month for you
to play this game he just like he was
like when it's done
everybody can like buy it oh i mean i
guess there's one way to do it
quantitative econ major here your hot
dog views are terrible just get both
this is what happens when you believe in
the invisible hand
excuse me uh the state could i please
have
one of everything instead of being
forced to make a choice
that's what you sound like right now
the sausage was upside down why eat
why choose between hamburgers and
sausages might when the
grill master will do it for you mate
freaking monday baby hot dog and
hamburger monday
frick yeah freaking monday no matter
what day
it is make it your day get a hamburger
and a hot dog
frick frick baby freaking yeah monday
you got no hot dogs
you're flat who are you
i interned i was the sous chef for
colonel sanders you're a nobody
you're nothing
you're everything that's wrong with this
world why should you get a hot dog and a
hamburger
when nobody some people haven't even
have their first hamburger yet or hot
dog they haven't even had the choice
anyway void boys poggy
poggy oh no he missed the hush oh no
all i can hear is frank costanza
i got a lot of problems with you people
sorry i lost my train of thought
okay yeah yeah yeah so what are we
fighting here i dude i haven't fought
this guy
in one billion years
i think he's oh wait we fight every boss
in the game we do a little boss rush
mechanic that's right
and then we we go to the largest room as
late as possible unless we feel like we
got the win
stacked up
okay so we do lose the lives i mean i'd
rather have the lives in the explosion
immunity
here's the thing like normally you don't
want to fight
delirium early but if you only have
eight item pedestals
you kind of like might as well
it's not like we're gonna have too much
of an accretive impact here you know
what i mean
oh yeah that's right delirium he does
some explosive damage right
maybe we can get rid of
probably meats
record collections little meat and
potatoes liz
plus it makes you look cooler
apollo how you doing what's what's going
on in the world of apollo today you
having a good easter
how's your rna doing you got any extra
ask him for a friend
okay all bandage there's value
i think it's my rna you can't have it
napoleon
give me some of your rna
no idiot get you wrong
freaking stupid
this is an honest question right so like
apollos had his first
shot
if he spit in my mouth what
level of protected would i be from
the coronavirus
like i'm not expecting it would be like
you know 80 but
zero well
what the heck apollo you you tricked me
you said it was it's just as good as the
vaccine
you freaking d-hole
we do a little trolling
we do a little trolling here monday baby
freaking rexy baby freaking pfizer baby
yeah
freaking pfizer yeah
a platter full of syringes in front of
him
yeah baby freaking monday we got
got the pfizer we got the moderna we got
the astrazeneca
f yeah
whatever you can't hit me gonna live
forever
this is what happens to your brain by
the way like when every isaac run
is is an hour and a half long like this
is absurd
i can't believe i've been live for two
and a half hours
i've done like one run and we're almost
done with our time
baby
by the way apollo on my front page today
uh uh
some among us streamers we're playing
geoguessr i'm gonna need you to relay a
message to that discord if you can
um is say my name
so if you just pass that on that would
be great steve
loves geo yeah and johnny loves chachi
but does chachi even give a flying frick
about joni
let me guess what's yeah what's next oh
we're going to start the show with
little sporkle in the morning
and then following that um we're gonna
do a little
we i found this cool website called
bracket fights where we can choose
the best sandwich of all time and then
we're gonna play golf with your friends
and talk about what we ate for lunch
nah just among us okay my my condolences
my condolences
yeah baby
freaking sus baby freaking monday baby
yeah tasks
tasks electrical baby where were you
hard clear baby
freaking mangas babies
so i'm so sorry
i don't know i don't know what's what's
wrong with me what the
heck is every food oh doesn't this cause
the items to all become hp
like they all flick back and forth
between hp that's insanely good
because hp is like one of the most
valuable items we could get right now
but we gotta hold it instead of
something else
and all these items are pretty good okay
i'm taking a leap of faith on this one
temporarily okay we're going to get rid
of tech x
just briefly
protect tech point five i should say
oh my god there's this is getting out of
hand now there's three of them
dude getting all this hp is really good
though
at this point we could dump nine lives
definitely do not give two hoots about
the compass
no reason not to stick with that they do
the same thing
forgot binge back there oh we got lucky
okay you're right i forgot binge eater
back there
just got insanely lucky
when you're when you're good it's just
how it goes man
i'm just gonna keep nine lives instead
of tech uh 0.5 and like
you know what the reason is you know
some point you just gotta say like
enough is enough man
you just gotta be like yeah
you know you just you're like a guy
you're like you know
it's like i could but like
i will yeah i got no problem with that i
will admit i'm too lazy to go back
the the flip side is i also think it's
the infinitesimally likely to make a
difference materially on our run
but i think this you know i'm i'm
prioritizing things that have a that are
that are much more likely to cause
material gains
plus with boss armor i don't even know
if tech.5 does like anything at all
use the arrow keys to shoot enemies it's
an interesting thought
um have you considered
pressing z or r twice to do a barrel
roll or alternatively using the boost to
get through
have you considered
bears beats battlestar galactica
i do have to go to the bathroom that
that i'm not going to deny that
would you rather die to delirium nine
times than have a better chance to beat
him once
would you rather uh say you were invited
to a barbecue hypothetically
uh get a hamburger or a hot dog you
can't take both
i answer your question with another
question
hamburger really see you you've poked a
bit of a hole into my theory
because my theory is that a hamburger is
better but a hot dog is more enticing
because of the infrequency of its
offering
i also think it's time for a hot dog
revolution
i think we should start having covered
buns
especially as they get uh fancier and
fancier they get more toppings
like on them the toppings are so likely
to either squeeze out of the top
or like roll off during consumption
what about a covered bun man it's just
more bun
and it keeps the stuff like locked in
there yeah like like
like a corn dog exactly but like instead
of being deep fried you know be like a
big
bun instead of like corn batter
okay we're gonna have to hit the enemy
at some point here it's my advice to
myself
whoa whoa whoa
now that's some dodging
don't really know what what a man
supposed to do about that
okay or or that for that matter all
right i i must admit we are about to die
and i i long for the the sweet release
at this point
if you just stay in that phase for a
little bit
light it ovum dude careful
saved isaac foot mom's foot
mommy's mommy's foot
i hate when he gives me the finger dude
it's like don't care didn't ask
plus you're a boss
help
i'm just gonna say it like i thought
this game was supposed to be hard
achievement unlocked spin down dice well
like it's
it's supposed to be tricky or something
[Laughter]
maybe apparently it's supposed to be
difficult or whatever
freaking monday baby freaking wait did
we not
because that was like we unlocked a lot
of the post-it note there
oh you don't unlock
other characters by doing things in this
mode you do the alt path or the the
super
secret path in the flip side and then it
unlocks the tormented version
okay that makes sense i thought maybe if
we got like enough hp
or something it would unlock maggie in
this one um i think we're gonna take
like a short



in here very simple we got a very simple
practice we're about to do we want to
unlock the redacted version of every
character
so let's try to do the redacted path
with some of the redacted characters so
that we can get a redacted uh
ending and after we do the redacted
ending we'll unlock the redacted
character and i think the best way to
start this is definitely to start uh
with eden why not why not
we start with one thing don't know why
it does even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind when you decide how
hard to try
exactly to hp though i'm not
super i'm not super stoked
so i do have one question to ask about
redacted by the way
uh
when you
go to redacted you need to
sleep in redacted
in order to get redacted or do you just
have to leave a redacted behind in a
redacted in order to get it
leave the thing in the thing okay and do
we leave it in the item thing or in the
boss thing
look i'm trying to spoil anything okay i
don't know what birthright does with
eden we're not gonna get the money
either way
uh jay you you got you guys swept away
man you guys swept
what it is jane knows what jade derived
this himself
jay is like walter white and i'm like uh
gill i'm just i'm following in his
footsteps
i'm like jay you got a beautiful recipe
i'm just trying the
i'm just trying to copy it and as long
as i keep my boss
uh gustavo fring happy then i i've got
nothing to worry about he's definitely
not gonna oh hold on there's a knock on
my door
that's right gail gail not uh not gil my
mistake
okay we're not gonna go to that room
just yet
okay okay yeah of course we're taking
this don't make me laugh
spoiled uh breaking bad look gail is a
very minor part of breaking bad
plus like if you know anything about the
show you already know that as soon as
you see him he's destined for uh
great things
exactly
what's the first grade on the redacted
character i actually don't know
i i mean i we gotta in order to get the
textbook we have to unlock them
you do already know the vibe yes sir
it's a tears upgrade you'd love to see
it now there's no reason
like we have to uh go to the alt
path but it does give us the chance
to get an extra item on the i mean we
get better item rooms
and we get uh better we get a chance to
get a second boss item on the mirror
floor so i'm gonna give it a try
and now what are your thoughts on
supertramp
um i don't dislike
the songs where they sing in the funny
voice
like i think those are pretty catchy
what what a shot
but songs like goodbye stranger where
the guy uses his normal voice
are actually like 10 out of 10.
how do you think aaron rodgers did on
night one
jay i gotta ask what the hell you're
talking about my man i don't know
i know who aaron rodgers is i don't know
what anything else uh
i don't know anything else about what
you're talking about to be honest on
jeff
oh aaron rodgers was hosting last night
oh
but dude let me tell you something and
i'm sure i'm preaching to the choir on
this one
couldn't be any worse than dr oz dude
like i didn't think it was possible for
someone to be like that much of a
charisma black hole
but
like on top of spreading like you know
anti-science disinformation
like on top of that he's just also like
not very good at those
sorry to say um okay
we got brown heart or a question mark
brown heart i don't think is too bad but
i'm a uh
i'm a right side man here
okay i sadly i think we still go
pandora's box
i think dirty mind is not so bad
but if you'll excuse me i wish i
had picked up dirty mind last room
i'd should love to have that dirty mind
right now oh
we we hit a couple notes in there
mozart's been real quiet since the new
steely dan isaac cover just dropped
confirmed did contain notes
okay we're probably i should not have
taken the alt path surprise surprise
secondarily i think
we must accept at some point we may have
to pandora's box
out of self-interest but we'll we'll see
what oh no he's excited and he just
can't hide it dude
what the heck just poison him
i wish not to use my bomb
oh let's go let's go tears up
um hold on hold on
i don't want to use pandora's box on the
other hand
it does give us spirit hearts
i mean i just got to say it i'm a madman
like
i don't know if this is the right way to
do it but we did we succeeded in
something
uh and that that something was belief
that's what's known as a high
testosterone play
i you're gonna laugh i actually think
that it was kind of worth it as long as
we don't die on this floor
we're leaving dimble behind for redacted
purposes
i wouldn't concern yourself with that at
the moment
only all i'm gonna say is if you know
then you know
okay we a test was was made here
it's very simple you come in here now
you get a red chest it has some pills in
it
you get a health upgrade you get a shot
speed upgrade
you cherry it out so you don't die you
go back to the boss room you pick up a
red heart and all of a sudden you're
kind of like you're good to go
i'm telling you he's he's an amazing
gamer
you could take it all the way to the
mausoleum though yeah but then like the
odds are
like i it's it's the kind of thing like
basically you're telling me like not to
do a chore when i have the
the mental preparedness for it
i appreciate that snooze much
appreciated
happy to happy to be able to provide
some second monitor content to the
people
you know doing the real jobs and keeping
the economy going right now
like uh i i'm taking it whatever who
cares watch this
i'm invincible um but like
i uh i want to leave the trinket behind
early and maybe we'll leave it behind
often as well
because like i don't want to create a
situation where like later i'm bantering
about like how
square pizza slices are underrated and
then all of a sudden like i get uh
i get distracted and i don't leave the
trinket behind where i'm supposed to you
know what i mean
twitch streamers are the backbones of
the economy
you know i used to believe that but but
some of them aren't even out there like
paying their electric bills
if you're not if you're not paying
utilities like
come on you got to step you got to put
on auto pay or something like that
what's your take on square pizza so i
i'm
look i know i'm getting baited here but
i'm okay with it because it's a self
bait
um i do like
uh around who doesn't love a round pizza
right but i'm
kinda like from memory cause it's been a
long time
i think detroit pizza is highly
underrated it's the only kind of pizza
that gives you a corner slice
and when the edges get uh get crispy
like that's a beautiful slice a circle
pizza can't give you that
now i'm not sometimes you get a square
pizza and they're just cooking it like
in a sous-vide or something and then
sending it out to sodexo to
you know make up school lunches that's
not really what i support
that's a bad pizza a pizza with
literally zero crisp is
is something i don't want a part of but
a crispy like detroit style pizza
and the pepperoni becomes little grease
cups now we're talking
jay you're not wrong now that i think
about it how messed up is it that pizza
is a circular food
with triangular slices that's served in
a uh
in a square box
did you know i i watched because like
i'm 100 years old so what do i watch on
youtube when i'm all done
reading about like you know boeing is
gonna like possibly cut their dividend
um i watch uh this show on cnbc called
make it
it's on their youtube channel and it's
basically just profiles of like american
businesses you're probably familiar with
they did an episode on domino's and i
was like man dominoes is crazy
when i was a kid it was the worst pizza
you could buy then they did their like
you know
campaign where they're like we're gonna
use real ingredients and now they're
pretty good now that they've got like
they got patents
right now to like get self-driving cars
that have a pizza oven in the car
and then you just put the uncooked pizza
in the car it drives to the delivery and
cooks the pizza while it's driving
that's so scary
it is though don't get me wrong it's
also like really sick
but i don't know if you should be having
like uh
you know like an oven on the road
like especially without any kind of
supervision in the vehicle like
no like so i guess the way that it works
or it's supposed to is like when it
arrives at your house
you it has like a qr scanner or
something is the idea
and you would like enter your code or
scan your your code from the phone
and then it would just open up a little
slot and you would take out the boxed
pizza
i guess this is a good point like how
much worse could it be than just an
internal combustion engine i didn't
really think about it that way but
that's a good point
when you have brownies do you like the
corner piece
yeah i like pretty much any food that
has edges
i always like the ones with the most
edges and
the least interior space i'm in i'm a
corner
first then edge then
inside piece
but i'm glad oh hello i'm glad there's
uh there's differences of opinion i
don't think i mean i think if i had to
guess edges and corners are probably the
most
common to begin with but um
i do think it uh it leads to like an
equilibrium right
where hopefully we can everybody can get
more or less what they're looking for
corner pieces freaking out monday biddy
i mean the inside piece don't get me
wrong i still eat it right but like
it's not at the top of the the power
rankings
i can't believe like we're still doing
well here okay i think at this point
we'll probably
not continue with the alt path because
the only reason i did it in the first
place was hubris
and we will also not take the uh oh what
a that's just embarrassing right there i
also
okay well uh you know i also think we
will not even get the knife
i think we're gonna go main path again
oh we got momentum here
hot sauce ranch or extra marinara
that's a really tough choice you know i
uh
here's what i'll say
i use pizza hut used to have
a bread stick crust that you could twist
off
and then you could dip it in the
marinara sauce they provided like a cup
of marinara sauce on the side
i ate so much of that pizza between the
ages of about 11 and 14
that like i think i ruined it for myself
ever that was the
it became the default pizza everybody
fell in love with up here at least
um okay you know what we should go to
the shop we got a dime there
but i gotta say like for
for crust dip ability i always
put a little frank's red hot sauce on
the on the top of the pizza but i would
rather have no hot sauce on the top of
the pizza
and then dip the uh the crust
in in either a ranch or a marinara i
think that's that's my two cents
i value the crust dip more than i value
the hot sauce
but i do want both i also
want the the crappy like fake parmesan
and i want the chili flakes like if i go
to a pizza place and they don't have
fake parmesan and chili flakes on the
table i'm like
this isn't legit
i want them all
also it needs to have a mayonnaise
smiley face on it and the letters papa
otherwise i won't even consider eating
it
i mean real parmesan sure but like you
know
i'm not out here trying to pay like you
know
seven bucks a slice just so they can
finance the real parmigiano reggiano
like i'm okay with the fake stuff in a
by the slice place
yeah i need a little of the sawdust i
will say because people are probably
uh you know they keep asking me every
day
um i did use the air fryer last night
one of our hello freshes was like a
a breaded turkey scallopini
with potato wedges and as soon as i saw
that it was like cut the potatoes into
wedges i was like
we're using the air fryer for this and
it turned out
beautifully
using the air fryer a little shed
uh i was using the air fryer
it's pretty good but i i will admit so
it also had uh
broccoli and i was like oh i want to do
the broccoli in the airfryer
oh i do like this but then it also had
that turkey scallopini that was
you know it's breaded right so i was
like oh i gotta do that in the air fryer
but the airfryer is not large enough in
order
to fit all these foods you know it would
take me like two hours in order to be
able to make
everything in the airfryer so i did use
the oven for the turkey and for the
the broccoli but for the wedges it went
very well
i'm telling you i'm like we i'm probably
not
like here's the deal right i want to use
the air fryer because it's convenient
but in order to get maximum convenient i
would need to rip out my oven
buy another oven that's in just a large
air fryer
and then reinstall it which is very
inconvenient
so in order to get convenience i have to
be like markedly inconvenienced first
so i'm probably never going to do it but
i totally understand why people buy
those like
you know air fryer ranges and stuff
i get it 100 percent
but i'm i'm fully a believer then like
another another
recipe we have for the air fryer enough
for the air fryer but from hellofresh is
like
yeah i'll do it shrimp and and pesto uh
flatbread pizza and i'm like you know
that's going in the air fryer
a hundred percent well you think i'm
just gonna put that stuff under the
broiler are you insane
yeah we also got a great one chicken and
banana served alongside prawns in a
chocolate sauce
i'm pretty stoked for that
hey can you shout out my stream hello
malf hello
it's no problem by the way that you
you're not streaming today so you
couldn't raid me
like i thought we had kind of an
understanding but
i mean i guess like you had important
things to do or whatever but it's still
just kind of
i like i walked out as he was paying out
oh that's what i deserve
i deserve it for the bm
what do you give this stream on the
mouth scale
i mean honestly we're like a minimum
seven and a half out of ten on the
stream so far
the energy is good the games we played
with dan were fun
and we're having an interesting run here
it's going to take us 12 years to
accomplish anything because we have no
uh
damage but that's fine on the mouse
what's the seven and a half on the mouth
scale i think it's l right
live laugh love or laughable lovable
f is fun i'll settle for an f
mouth did you watch bad trip yet i think
it should be required viewing for you
and sips before we play rainbow six i
think
i don't like i've i don't know sips
as well as i would like what is bilbo
said and i know twice as many of you
half as much as i wish that i did
like some i know too many of you half as
much as i wish that i didn't and i'm
like what the
this guy is he's the real wizard a
wizard of words
but anyway um
something about talking to sips and then
also watching bad trip
i feel like he would love it anybody
here been watching sips for a long time
can you can you support or reject my
hypothesis
can confirm he would love it
i thought i don't know i just i gotta i
got the vibe from sips that this was up
even when i was watching i was like man
sips has got to see this
oh it's not a documentary he does love
the documentaries though i wonder if
he's
because he always talks about those hbo
documentaries i wonder if he saw the
the weird pseudo documentary about john
delorean i was talking about
i like less than half of you half as
well as you deserve yeah exactly
hold on i think we would
like to get uh the blanket i feel like
this greed
is gonna pay out man like
not greed this judgment but i do want
this this is such good devil deal tech
behind the curve is still a top tier
documentary i
always love like documentaries about
weird stuff like behind the curve is a
great one
yeah take it why not
you ever see the queen of versailles
that was a
fantastic movie as well documentary
it's about a uh like this
unbelievably wealthy couple
uh because the husband is like a huge
executive
and then uh it all comes crashing down
over the course of the documentary and
she has to rebuild her life as like a
working class
individual it's a great movie great
documentary i should say
have you seen the death of stalin check
this i've seen it two times
that's that's how much i like the death
of stalin that was probably my favorite
movie of that year
that's a great movie i i also
i i have indeed seen the theranose
documentary
that is crazy man for anyone that
doesn't know theranos was
they they were a san francisco base or a
silicon valley based
company that was gonna uh revolutionize
uh well disrupt really the world of uh
blood testing
so instead of having to go to the doctor
and they run like a little tiny
uh you know blood profile on you that
that oh we don't wanna go this way what
am i thinking
we're just out of here costs a lot of
money and they only test a couple of
things it takes you a week to get a
uh a result back they were like hey
we're just gonna invent a uh
a device where you just put the blood in
and it just spits out your profile in
like 20 minutes
and then they obviously like they got
multi-billion dollar contracts from
pharmacies in the us and it turns out it
was all a scam
they never got the product to work for
one and
their prototypes were literally just
like
they would buy their competitors
products that they were trying to make a
better version of and then just
change the branding so that it was it
was like inside of a theranos housing
and then they'd be like check it out and
then some of them they were running the
blood
like they were doing blood tests at like
cvs
and they told people that uh
like we're putting it into the therinos
machine but then what they were actually
doing is like taking the blood and
shipping it across the country to
california and then just running
conventional blood tests on it and then
sending the results back
but also the results were wrong like it
was it's just terrible
i have to watch that we work documentary
too because like
i mean it's the same thing right like
who look i'm kind of like
you know we're streaming on twitch right
now don't get me wrong
uh there's always things to lampoon in
in
startup culture even though i'm also
kind of like a part of it it like only
tangentially but still
um but i'm i'm into all those
it's just crazy man
dude
yeah i have hbo they play documentaries
like 24 7.
yeah i don't understand we work like
like there's
two or three enormous
like corporate i think we work buildings
in
in vancouver so i'm like kind of
familiar with some of them
or like i was sort of watching the like
the business as it was coming up and i
just didn't get it
so they they were like airbnb for
offices like if you had empty space in
your building
you could be like hey we're going to
turn that into a we work like shareable
office that people
can use but then they started like
buying buildings
and then just renting out the offices
as we work and i was like that's just
it's just real estate i think
again i'm kind of like ignorant for like
how the business operates obviously but
i'm like i'm pretty sure you just
invented like like real estate
but i'll i will also tell you one time
and it wasn't uh wework
it was like uh it was some kind of
similar
deal but i had to get a uh an electronic
uh key copied you know like something
you'd use to buzz yourself into
like a secure room in this case uh the
room that stores my building's garbage
[Laughter]
which admittedly you do want to have
locked down um
but uh when i was in there like i went
to the
the guy's office to get it copied and
i walked in and there was like a meeting
room with like 12 people
having meetings and then like i turned
the corner and there was a little closet
but it was actually like a recording
booth and some guy was like recording
his podcast in there or something
and like i i'm pretty sure i was in like
a wee work office
without knowing it really but i was like
you know this is
this is wild man
i don't know i could i could sort of see
it but
i do there's only a couple other things
i know about wework
i don't want to i don't want to ruin a
uh you know potential sponsor deal with
wework at some point but uh
i i do know that they had a huge meeting
where they fired a bunch of employees
and then like literally minutes after
they were like
by the way run dmc is here and they like
came out
playing tricky or something like that
it's just like
it's like actually a moment from silicon
valley the show
that's all i got though it's it's a lot
like going under right
yeah can you imagine cleaning out your
desk everybody else is in the conference
room
it's tricky to rent an office to rent an
office that's not on the traditional
property market it's tricky
we working working i don't know they
might have just you know
who knows man they they might have just
sang the original song
i have seen wild wild country as well
also
an insane documentary netflix has a lot
of good ones
like i think they've lost their touch a
little recently with like the
uh the cecil hotel and stuff like that
but
wild wild country is incredible evil
genius is
is insane
i mean like you know now that we're a
year removed from it maybe people
aren't as like upset like tiger king is
genuinely like
i mean it's like a one-of-a-kind work
let's put it that way
like
and a lady gets her arm bit off in the
first episode man
and it only goes up from there
i have i've seen one of the fire
festival documentaries
oh that's the like if you actually
respect yourself you don't want to watch
trash tv
um the uh the staircase is the best for
sure
hello
staircase is very good
okay damage please um damage please
just a a wafer thin spot of damage
please
speed i mean if that were damaged that
would be pretty good
hbo's the jinx oh don't even get me
started but
here's what i'll say about the jinx i
don't i don't i think the jinx is very
well done
but it's only mildly entertaining
except for the ending which is one of
the greatest twists
in movie history which is equally insane
because it's a documentary
like the ending to that series is iconic
i'll base i'll just spoil it for you but
basically they've been investigating
this guy for like murders he got off
from let me rephrase murders he was
acquitted from
uh in the over the course of his life
and then they really started like they
they basically get like a smoking gun
uh where where they're like hey we're pr
and he's like a super billionaire like
son of a
hedge fund owner or something melvin
capital et cetera et cetera
um so
they get a smoking gun basically like
incontrovertible proof
that that he was behind these murders
and they
summoned him because they've been making
a documentary about his life over the
course of the investigation
they summon him to an interview just as
like a postmortem to be like what are
you up to now
and then they ambush him with the info
and he's like
you know whatever like see you guys
later like he's not mad he
sort of thinks like he got out of it
maybe and then he goes to the bathroom
with his hot mic still on
and he he goes like you know like he's
like
borderline like crying in the bathroom
and stuff like that and he's like why is
this happening to me
uh oh right because i killed all those
people and you're like
what he just
like he just admitted to it at the end
basically and that's like
you know it it's it's an all-time great
tv moment
i've been working on this story for six
years and
you just tweeted it
i i have seen the imposter as well sus
by the way sus
but it was a long long time ago isn't
that that's the movie about that
french guy that like tricks a couple
into thinking that he's their long-lost
son
dude i realize now i've seen a lot of
documentaries
i didn't realize you see man on wire man
on wire that's a wonderful movie
by the way get get ready because like i
mean this is the kind of banter we're
gonna get
on a run where we have no damage
we're gonna be talking about this for a
long time
i oh i have watched the lobster i
i don't know if i would say the lobster
is one of my favorite movies but
i was i was i think about that movie
often and i was enamored with it for
for quite some time i can fly what am i
doing
because i bombed them all of course
not not a documentary yes although how
weird would that be
but i know i have not seen the killing
of a sacred deer yet
did they use that song killing of a
sacred deer gun
the those who kill
a sacred deer are doomed and cursed by
the
i don't know i basically know the
premise but
books baby they're books baby did that
hand just grab another hand what are you
jealous
quarantines got everybody feeling
isolated
okay i mean i'll always take bad phd
dude i got no complaints there
health down it would give us a damage up
dude i'm
i'm just the kind of weirdo that's
capable of doing that like that doesn't
bother me
let me know when you see that tinted
skull by the way
oh uh don't don't oh you could give him
that one now that's right oh
i don't know i don't know
i still can't get in huh
my kid just said quarantine has got him
feeling blessed
honestly if your kid tweeted that they
would oh there's the tinted skull
um they would be just they would delete
their account within 12 hours they would
be cyber bullied to oblivion
but what i'm gonna say is instead like
you should protect that attitude at all
costs
that's that's a very like personality
rich thing for a kid to say
like even if your kid was like eight or
younger
like people on twitter would be ruthless
well it must be nice that your dad's uh
in the middle class
i mean this is the actual like the
perfect example of a straw man because
this has not happened but like
you know they would they would actually
bully that eight-year-old i guarantee it
and then when people were like why are
you bullying bullying an eight-year-old
they'd be like uh
their dad works from home so
it's praxis we're gonna get the skull
everyone just chill out okay i'm just
exploring the floor first
just doing a little floor exploration
let hold on let me write your next
comment for you
how much do you want to bet that he
forgets
nice little damage upgrade by the way
nice little damage upgrade by the way
i mean you're not wrong working from
home is pretty pog
i'm i'm very grateful for that
cheers to the new golden age of content
oh thank you
a toast to the isaac to the isaac to the
isaac
to the king of retail to the key okay
that's you got to shove one hamilton
reference into every uh
episode i guess but
i have been i know i talked about this
before i have been
kind of like increasingly like um maybe
i'll just like
never go to twitter again
like it's not there's not really been
like a single moment where i was like
hey we gotta like you know like oh i'm
done with this app
it's just like an almost like an
auditing process
where i think to myself you know like
okay i was on twitter for like 20
minutes today
like did that time improve my life or
like take away
from it and it's like almost exclusively
a net negative
i see some funny things but then also
like my mental state
is like worse having been
on the site if that makes sense like i
see some things that make me laugh but i
only ever leave the site like anxious or
angry and i'm starting to
starting to get to the point where i'm
like why would i keep going to this site
don't get me wrong the funny things are
funny and then i do get some uh
take it for now i guess we should take
the the the pills oh but then we'd screw
up our fool card
yeah we'd probably screw up our full
card so let's not do that
don't take the baggie yet we can take it
when we leave i think i will take this
too
it did lower our damage but it raised
our rate of fire i'm not too upset we
can get pills like crazy
no it's not like i mean people are like
you follow the wrong people i don't
think it's really like that
like i honestly think it's just like
i think the app intentionally or
otherwise
realize that the formula to like come on
tomorrow in the box please
in the box in the box please my son
in the box please the the formula for
like
max engagement is like anger basically
it's not really about who you follow you
got to keep in mind you know like i
i get tweeted like 500 times a day
which is not a flex it's actually a
curse excuse me
and you know don't get me wrong i i get
people that are like
you know that's great intel or like like
i loved your video today or whatever
but also i mean it's really like i'm
kind of reaching the point
where like the older i get the more i'm
like i don't want
people to have like a a one-way way to
contact me
yo como you gotta get in the box my man
okay
like i think that the uh especially like
the more i've been like reading
after i read like i feel good
and then i'm like ah before bed maybe
i'll just go on twitter for five minutes
and then it like erases that hour of
reading
[Laughter]
i think honestly like i don't think i
would like delete my account but i have
been
thinking about deleting the app for sure
there there is the downside of like not
uh
being able to like you know send out
announcements and stuff like that but
i'm also like
i don't know if i even like maybe that's
not even that big of a deal
okay so we've already left the trinket
behind is that correct
we left one behind does it count maybe
i should leave one behind in the item
room though
just to be sure why not myostosis i'm
not i'm not too upset
to lose this
but chibs on twitter yeah i got i got
chib on uh
on discord i got a main line
anywhere on the floor and it would be
fine
i mean it's mostly i'm just uh i'm just
spitballing it's not like a super
negative thing it's just been on my mind
where i'm like
i mean let me put it this way like
people are like oh and you think tick
tock is good for you no but it's it's
like
different i think and it's going to come
across like a flex but it's really the
opposite
it i think it's different as like a
public figure you know like
on tick tock i'm predominantly like
and i don't even use the app honestly
but i'm uh
just consuming content whereas like on
twitter i'm like
i'm just kind of like on duty as myself
[Laughter]
or as my brand uh so it's like the
difference between like
you know turning uh tick tock for me is
like turning on the tv
and twitter is like actually like
sitting down
at like a table and being like all right
come you know tell me like your praise
or your grievances and it's just like
you know grading basically i'm wondering
like as i get older i'm wondering more
like as especially as my time gets more
limited i'm like does this actually
serve me
and i don't know if the answer is yes
okay we take we leave
we consider possibly buying some hp
before we leave
we consider possibly you know a little
baggy i think we should get a little
baggy yeah
i support it range down love it been
drinking it for years
the fool i don't think so
it's no longer the fool now it's retro
vision
thank you so much for the black heart
yeah like honestly i um and we talked
about this forever like as it was
happening
but like i didn't delete facebook until
like last year
i was always like i know i should but at
the same time like oh how's like my
grandma gonna
uh talk to me and stuff like that and
then i was just like you know got her
phone number and i deleted facebook and
like it's way better it just like
instantly was was removed from my life
and was just a positive to begin with uh
let me i'm just going to try to get to
the secret rooms then we'll get out of
here
so i'm kind of like in the same boat
with twitter like i've been thinking
about it for long enough that i'm like
you know maybe maybe it's time
yeah i like i i think twitter makes a
lot of sense
or it makes more so i mean i i get how
this sounds by the way
um but like if you're
not a public figure you're just the
consumer of twitter
i think it's a lot easier to tailor your
uh
your experience but if instead you're
you know you're you're kind of like a
satellite
receiver you know as a public figure
is like everybody else is like if you
have an audience of like
a hundred thousand people and then like
point one percent of them have like
serious problems those end up getting
like reflected to you and it's just
annoying
like i know how it sounds i'm like i'm
sorry that like things are
messed up for you but also like i have
absolutely no part of that whatsoever so
if you could just like
stop using like the fact that we
uh like have a parasocial relationship
as an excuse to dump on me like that
would be
that would be beautiful i think
there's an item in the challenge room
yeah i don't think i can get
into the the challenge room right
like via the secret room the door was
locked
yeah see dan's got it all figured out i
mean i'm sure then
i mean this is just real like see
um this is like uh it's check the wire
talk dan
if you bomb it it's good no
come on i was born at night but not last
night
um i'm sure like you you went through
something similar last year with
with uh big brother dan like that's kind
of why i'm surprised that like uh
you you have dms open i'm not trying to
open up a can of worms but i guess like
you know maybe maybe we're just built
different in the sense that like uh
you know what one like weirdo dm could
like
annoy me greatly um whereas for you
maybe it like rolls off your back a
little bit more but i'm like
i'm just surprised ignore the jabronis
and pog the normies
i hear you but and yeah i mean that's
the idea right but it doesn't always
work out that way
pog the normies
[Laughter]
okay we gotta do the mausoleum
i i really do want to take this health
down i think we can get away with it i'm
just letting it simmer for a bit just in
case like my brain
processor decides that it's wrong but
for now i think it's like
it's right anyway again this stuff is
it's not actually
it's not like i had a bad day on twitter
or something like that just like one too
many days of being like
like 60 of the time i use this app i'm
not enjoying myself and i'm like okay
well then why the heck am i using it
just a pad jack dorsey's uh
net worth
we'll see anyway we'll see just step on
the button
okay i'm gonna take it i mean it's a
very sizable damage
up evil eye hopefully buffed but
perhaps not there's also a tinted rock
next to the button that's good
backseating thank you thank you
there is indeed
your tweets are pog that's all right
like here's the thing
i think it's a false dilemma i always
repeat my incredible jokes on stream
anyway
sometimes many times you wouldn't you
wouldn't actually be missing out on
anything i think
like a joke starts like when i'm in bed
and then i like use it in an isaac
episode and then i tweet it and then i
tweet
or then i talk about the tweet in the
stream and then i talk about the
reaction to the stream inside of the
the next isaac episode like it's all a
big like water wheel that goes
goes around and around
yo have you noticed how many views your
twitch vods have been getting
uh i haven't really i mean i see them
every day i didn't notice anything that
like
it it blew me away but i might be
misjudging i guess i am publishing like
three a day they add up pretty quick
but um also that you know we're in that
bubble right now where like
anything isaac related is gonna like go
to the stratosphere
[Laughter]
which is why like i admittedly there's a
little voice in the back of my head
that's like you need to do
more variety because of the fact that
the uh
you know like i look at my youtube page
and it's like oh isaac and i'm like
well yeah but like if there's any time
for that to happen it's like right now
where they're doing like 4x
uh what every other piece of content
does oh like on
on twitch proper yo that's pretty
amazing
those you know it's like wild it i think
it just goes to show you
like not maybe not that the grass is
always greener
but it's very like psychologically
interesting for me
what the when when a video gets like 50
000 views on youtube i'm like that's
pretty good don't get me wrong i'm happy
with that
but if a video gets like 20 000 views on
twitch
i'm like that's incredible i'm in the
stratosphere now
it's the same it was funny like you know
i i never got to the point where like
tiktok is uh monetized
but uh i was trying to get into that
like tick tock partner program
i was like making if i could even make
like fifty dollars off of my like one
million or two million view tik tok
that would be like worth more to me than
like a week's pay
on twitch not because the numbers are
bigger but because of the fact that it's
just like
it's so novel you know i'm like well i
didn't know you could make money doing
this
donkey dunk donkey duck
that's true because i feel like um
uh twitch videos have to be searched out
they don't get recommended naturally
like via the algorithm
like it's almost more flattering because
people come to twitch
to watch it i guess instead of being
like
you know they just get sucked down the
rabbit hole or they fall asleep
have you looked at the analytics on leg
breaker recently
it's been getting recommended in my
youtube feed a lot yo i'll check it out
because like you guys were bang on about
kooky yomi
kukiomi got like a it got a good deal of
attention it kind of slowed down which
is you know
natural but i see leg breaker a lot too
you know this is one of my favorite
stream segments
let's go take a look okay leg breaker
he's got legs he knows how to break them
i'm looking at the graph holy crap
the graph is like normal
flat you know and then it's flat for a
year
and then as of um what day is this
as of last sunday it goes from flat
to straight up oh my god okay check this
out
sunday march 28th it had a total of 208
558 views 208 558
that was last sunday as of today
april 6th it is
291 446.
oh my god it's gotten like 80 000 views
in a week
that's crazy man that's like
that's that's more than the new videos
get in the week they're published by far
that's the thing like and this is again
like
uh it's check the wire adjacent right
but it's like a nice kind of inside
baseball right like i don't think people
are upset by that
um but every youtube video like it's a
lottery ticket and you never know
i mean it may never pay off but it also
might pay off completely unexpectedly
like
years down the road like it's it's very
weird but that
honestly like i feel like a genius
because that was like the whole
one of the main like content slash
business reasons for uh
northern lion tries
was like um you know
all these games like you never know
which one's gonna which ones are gonna
pop
uh pop off and which ones are gonna be
uh
a little snoozy okay you cannot leave
that's my mistake
youtube algorithm is super weird yeah
but i'll tell you know what i'm not
gonna do
i'm not gonna do what i did with kukiomi
and change the title to say like
number one platformer of 2000 and 2021
there could have been other factors
but uh when i when i changed the kuki
yomi's title it was like the algorithm
was like
no now you're toasted
it was like the title was doing the work
for me or something
no but that's like um first off one of
the reasons i do so much variety on
twitch is like
that i just i would much rather play 20
different games
for an hour each than play one game for
20 hours with the notable exception of
something like this
but then secondarily you know you get
more
and i was telling this to dan in the
back channel you get more lottery
tickets uh
on youtube as well like you never know
you know if you're gonna do
like a full playthrough of like what
remains of edith finch or whatever like
you know you you know episode 20 is
never gonna get sucked in
he forgot the key i actually don't
it's not that i forgot the key i'm just
unaware of the
the mechanic here
so you oh whatever you leave behind you
actually have to go back
and pick it up
okay so we will just go back to the the
downpour or the dross one
and we'll pick up the uh
we'll pick up the trinket we left behind
way back there if we get a chance
you need to go to the room you left the
trinket on all right
it's good to know but yeah like instead
of playing like you know 20 games of the
same
series although obviously like we do
that all the time um
or semi frequently at least you know to
play 20 different things because you
never know in
you know 2024 if maybe somehow
wanted raccoon is going to become like
the new hotness and then like uh
a new group of egg maniacs like find out
that you exist
that's why you leave it in the boss room
because that's where you spawn and you
can't miss it
yo i mean that's great news because on
the dross one we did leave it on the
boss room
so i think we're still okay here
yeah draws one baby unless we end up
on basement one
like you might because i don't know i
don't know what i'm talking about
i'm like the dross one comes after the
basement so we should be fine
you might be screwed oh what a shot
because cracked key is considered a rune
so little baggie might mess it up
would be it would be a modest annoyance
for sure
but we'll see we'll see
health down little little spicy but
we're not really using the health anyway
so you know what give me the extra
damage
why use it we got we got anti-phd so our
damage goes up would rather at this
point i would rather have 12
extra damage than uh
one extra red heart i think that's i
think that's an acceptable trade-off
wouldn't it be funny if he died
uh if if me dying in this game makes me
funny then
i mean honestly you you just gave me the
greatest compliment of all time
because i die all the time in this game
so you just called me this the strongest
comedian in earth's history
thanks for the compliment
the bean
you have about a 68 win rate excuse me
sir toasty any any number that shows up
in chat we need to have a repeating of
course after it
68 repeating of course i think it did
screw it up
because we're we're on the uh the
downpour
and we we got uh
we got a pill instead of the key that's
that's heavy
uh i'm upset energy
you know what now we know that look i'm
not gonna promise we're never gonna make
that mistake again
all i'm gonna say is uh i think that's
at least the kind of mistake where you
can be like you know what that's pretty
reasonable
so you don't just get the item that we
need by
sleeping in the bed and then opening the
the chest
only the first time that's only the
first time oh
man maybe we'll just get lucky because
it's a random item right like what if it
it's just the item we need
just believe as long as we believe
there's nothing to fear
one in 700 chance
okay good to know though for the future
what the heck is this by the way
i can't believe i'm excited it's still
active
it's like a 1 in 13 chance it's not that
bad dude i think we're gonna do it we'll
probably
die to the first version of the boss but
still
give it a try anyway clip farming
the dad saying i'm sorry gives me chills
your music saved me
okay we're good
getting too cocky and taking unneeded
damage
bro it's just it's just hard it's
it's just tough
[Laughter]
it's not an easy game here it's not a
i don't think it's like a mental state
issue i think it's a uh
it's just a it's a difficult task f
mom's wig
um all right well we'll we'll try to
kill static electric boss but we're uh
we're probably toasted
dude i wonder if we'd gotten our health
all the way to zero
oh that's tough to dodge man
if we'd gotten our health all the way to
zero i wonder if we could have slept in
both beds and gotten like six spirit
hearts out of it
godhead tears mommy
this really like drives it home how
strong we were when we came through here
for the first time
like when people were like if nl does
this first try he's a legend i was like
it's not even hard
i've been back here a couple times
spoilers and uh
i'm like now i'm like okay i understand
why people were like it's so impressive
that you did it the first try
that was close though that was a good
run we can try again we can try another
eden run there slash marker
first attempt over and then we're not
going to put that until i hydrate
because it makes it easier to splice



about it many times it's not one of her
top tier movies
but i understand his stars adrian brodie
and
he um makes like a
a super being that he then
copulates with
all of those movies that are like
allegories for being spermjacked
are like the ultimate scary movie right
alien species
splice
i don't know what it is man they the
people involved with the creation of
those films need the
they need therapy for sure
but not until they finish their magnum
opus
i don't make the rules annihilation
yeah it's still like i don't know that's
like my hill to die on i still don't
really like annihilation
i thought it was cool um but
not that good like i mean it doesn't
hold a candle to captain america the
winter soldier
but obviously like it has some amazing
set pieces and ideas
chills when he says don't kill me i'm
the winter soldier
oh man chills
when caesar the the chimpanzee from
planet of the apes
goes no oh man
flames on the side of my face
have you seen high life okay high life
is like
if someone watched uh annihilation it
was like it's not already enough for
me i actually and i i've so rarely do
this but i've talked about it before so
i apologize for repeating myself but
high life is one of the very few movies
i've ever just been like you know what
i'm just done like i turned it off like
half an hour in
i was like i get it you're smart like
okay you're i i consider myself like i
have a fairly high tolerance for like
like higher than normal at least let's
not say high tolerance for like art
house nonsense
like the lobster i enjoy myself greatly
i had a great time it's
abstract but it's also entertaining high
life i was like just come on man
just like like literally like do
anything
anyway that's all i got
the do anything challenge
failed items are pretty pog here for
sure
no question
i thought i hit the space bar instead i
just got really lucky
high life is genuine french art house
which means you're actually not supposed
to enjoy it
well let me say in that case they
accomplish their objective
with uh with the plum
i'm not use like i i'm not using that as
a dunk like i absolutely believe that
that's the case
that instead of actually like enjoying
the film
like it's it's actually just supposed to
maybe even just
unnerve you maybe is a good way to
describe it
um but uh
i'm very much not one of those people
that's like uh
the movie made me feel like a negative
emotion and movies are supposed to be
leisure so i hate it
uh but i mean i was just bored like
that's really what it came down to yo
ghost pepper
is like insanely great
we gotta try i mean if we're going all
the time
saved if we're going all the way we
gotta try
the paw play don't call everything the
blank play 2021 challenge oh whoops you
failed
yet again
curse room then i don't know what my hp
is like so i'm
i'm scared i'm a little frightened
relatable
you know kind of what happened on
twitter yesterday and i'm not like this
is not like a major catalyst or anything
but i i i tweeted something and i'm
putting somebody on blast here so i
apologize to them
in advance um but like i tweeted the
dumbest thing of all time right
i tweeted like if you sent a chicken
nugget back in time
to the 16th century would
uh queen elizabeth the first think it
was the most delicious thing she'd ever
eaten
i just thought it was a little funny
okay and then
somebody like quote tweeted it and was
like based on
the way that this is worded it was sent
back in time and not placed in front of
her it simply appeared in her mouth
so she would choke on it this is why it
matters the way that we
uh like word things and then i was like
what are you talking about
and i clicked on their profile and their
profile was like i'm a phd candidate
in like semantics and linguistics and i
was like
what and i was i was like
really
like i guess i'm i'm so detached like
from academia like i don't know
like like what are you doing
i don't unders like is is there a class
in that phd track that's also like um
how to talk to strangers
that you've never met before but like uh
you know how to like be nice and not
come across
like so kind of weirdly aggressive in
in the first tweet i've ever seen you
make like
okay i need to get a trinket and then
drop it in one of these rooms man
we're gonna drop it in a boss room so i
can't miss it that's that's the game
plan
and and that's i think that's a really
good microcosm
of like why and i've been struggling to
come to like a clear point on this but
why twitter like kind of sucks
as you grow larger on it is because
instead of being able to like
i don't mean like say whatever you want
without consequence or anything like
that
but like the more people that follow you
is like the
the more what you tweet doesn't matter
and the more like
somebody else's personal problems become
you know what you deal with all the time
[Laughter]
instead of being like i made a funny
joke it's like
it has to instead be uh you know
you know like well if you filter the
joke through the legacy of 13th century
colonialism or something like that and
i'm like
i said consider that when i had the
mental image of
queen elizabeth eating a chicken
mcnugget my
mistake i'll delete it
like i get it it's not it's not that
you're wrong
it's like i just
just didn't look at it that way
anyway moving along yes dear
honey it's 10 times a day time for your
tweet to be filtered through
karl marx is dos capital again yes dear
i'm sorry i would one one slash question
mark i would like to apologize
to anybody that filtered my
previous tweet through the lens of karl
marx's dos capital i did not consider
when i made a joke um do you think
lex luthor would buy a tesla i forgot
that like it's problematic that
lex luthor and then also lex luthor made
me think of zack snyder and zack snyder
makes me think of
henry cavill and henry cavill has me he
makes me think of army hammer for some
reason and then army hammer has me
thinking all sorts of thoughts now
no lex luthor would not buy a tesla lex
luthor is a
tesla okay drop the trinket
is this a chat rant literally like not
at all
were you listening okay let's not make
the same mistake we made last time
dude i gotta be honest with you we got
plenty of time to get
hp
so i'm gonna get a little spicy here man
i'm not afraid of getting a little spicy
we got a tinted rock back here
you definitely get this
how do you tell where secret rooms are
no what you say is tell me you're a
secret room without telling me you're a
secret room
yes sir i got rooms on multiple sides of
me
yes sir options there might be options
build a little bird house in your soul
easy take i don't know what it does but
can't forget the bomb yes sir
yes sir no possible blocked entrance on
any side yes sir
you already know the vibe
but that didn't answer your question
tuesday baby
does that answer it tuesday
and now watch a new video to quote i did
watch the entire
um angry man in new york video the other
day
twice actually once before the stream
and i mentioned it but but once again
last night
i wish it weren't three and a half
minutes long
because it makes it hard to remember
absolutely everything but
there's there's a lot of great stuff in
that video
but then people were saying
that it's actually fake which is still
like
look just because something's like a
staged video
wouldn't make it unfunny to begin with
it would just be different you know it
would be a different style of
entertainment
um but
like what's what's the evidence that
it's fake
he looks at the camera a lot yeah but
when i'm out in public i look at the
camera all the time like if people are
taking a
photo of something i'm always like
it's like human nature
you just say i'm classically trained i'm
contemporaneously trained
you're nothing you can't even hold a
note
it's not fake but he did cameo brother
in a safety
brothers film see i can see why you
would be confused but the safety
brothers have a history
of uh using non-actors in their movies
for example adam sandler was in their
last one
so they're not afraid to really get
people that
don't have uh uh any history in the in
the medium
leads to some raw performances sometimes
hyo got him got him
adam sandler just went oof ouchy
somewhere
and he doesn't know why
excuse me can i have some keys please
this run is really good
i'm glad we leveraged absolutely
everything let's not throw it away
though
he's wiping his tears with hundred
dollar bills you wiping your tears with
bitcoin you lost shot happy gal mar
belly madison
you know what would be a cool item in
isaac what if there was an item
where like you could call it materia
and when you used it it played the
entire
knights of the rounds uh animation from
final fantasy vii
and then did like 9999 damage to the
boss
so that when you were in the middle of a
run you could pop that it would be a
space bar item with with a large charge
for sure and then you could you could
use it and then go to the bathroom in
the middle of your run
day
okay sorry but i stand by it
i do um i played a lot of
final fantasy vii man
that's all i got
no this was before anime was invented
so you cannot call me that that
four-letter word
the the only anime that existed when
final fantasy vii came out was astro boy
true thank you i saw one person say true
that's all i need
yeah they were still they had done half
the intro for cowboy bebop they were
still working on the actual show
take the new door in the depths too what
do you think guys
by the way what happened to my my chest
there
what do you think let's let chad vote on
it sorry
oh what all my stuff is disappearing man
you have a choice of of loot to pick up
after a room
that's what i'm learning here they give
you two pieces of loot you can only take
one
ah dude that's a great item right there
too
i had this with contract from below and
it sucked that that does sound terrible
so it pays out with like four chests but
you can only open one of them
we got to be mighty careful by the way
with this loot cause i i am in the habit
of just running over it as it spawns
no thank you oh but we can only pick up
one of these things right
oh never mind
the loot's gambit dude don't even get me
started
on netflix man they really dropped the
ball
come out with good shows like how hard
is that
but like seriously come on man like come
out with good
shows
we already did this bit yeah but i think
of it every day
pogba
guppy guppy pog
tweet them with some new show ideas we
can't do it during covet but i'm telling
you
the the ultimate dream show that i have
for netflix mal for you still here
the ultimate dream show that i have for
netflix is still an exact copy of the
simple life
but with me and mouth instead of
um paris hilton and nicole richie
so they just have malfoy and i go to
like local businesses like maybe we
could like i don't know
work the back kitchen at a burger king
one day or something like that
i think it would be good because i'm
just gonna be real with you like malf
has
more skill in almost every aspect of
what could possibly be considered labor
than i do
but i'm really good at not letting dead
air take over
so i think it would be a great
combination
and i i always give i give my all
that's what i'll say about that i give
my all
i i know what you're gonna say but i'm
not convinced it's worth the smelter
here
i i give my all and i also think i make
mistakes
in in very unusual ways
if that makes sense like i very rarely
when i do something wrong
do i do it wrong in a boring way
kate will tell you that for sure too
like sometimes she'll be like like we'll
be holding like a a
like a box for example and we gotta fit
it through a doorway and she's like
just twist it and i'm like what are you
talking about twisted there's an
infinite possible number of ways that
something could be twisted
in three-dimensional space you've got to
be more specific
i really feel like the average person
when someone goes twisted they go
oh yeah i got it and then they just
oriented in the right direction
in order to fit it through the door but
i don't i don't do that
my brain doesn't work that way for some
reason yeah i'm bill o'reilly there's no
words on it
what do you mean to play us out
yeah i kind of want like xyz coordinates
take your left hand
and raise the thing up a little bit
that's that's i'm i'm not being
insincere like
that would be like the perfect input for
my brain
i it's very unreasonable to expect
another human being the interface
at that standard but
but in my head i'm like
you could twist it a variety of ways
yes
what the
i don't understand yeah please give me a
a carternian a quarternion
i don't know
uh that's pretty good that's a pretty
good item
terrific item okay please shout when you
see that
never mind i've found it of my own
volition there is the tinted skull
this run really does have almost
everything i will also say
people are like how come i see that uh
every time i see this guy he's got the
most overpowered run of all time
this cause you know you can go back to
like floor two where i was one hit away
from death and still did
amazing diagonal walking to to leverage
my advantages for the future
you could also go back to the part where
we blew up a mushroom accidentally and
it was uh magic mush and then also the
part where
um you know we got nine lives for
nothing and also the part where we just
got cricket set in an item room but
alternatively like
you make your own luck so i've always
said it you make your own luck
i learned that from tiger woods and
that's a man who knows a thing or two
about getting lucky
according to the documentary
okay we're good right we're good to
leave yes we have the full card we can
do this
yes sir i've been using that joke since
like
i don't know probably like 2013.
look at the damage man in a bit like
ghost
pepper scales with luck now yo can i go
into boss rush
and then full card out like it should
still work right
you know what i'll i did leave a trinket
but i'm gonna leave another one why not
you could totally do it all right let's
do it then
yeah babe
doesn't it sound like alexander hamilton
and
am i crazy or not
that's what it sounded like to me i was
thinking it too
see
i thought so i thought so
i was thinking it but you're crazy as
well you're crazy for this one
we're in boys okay down to the mausoleum
i'm just a notch on your bed post and
you're just a line in a song
mouth how's your day going by the way
you're having a good day
no dragons please thank you for the the
gifted subscriptions
much appreciated would you mouth are you
like jazzed out of your mind because
your two favorite nhl teams are actually
like sick this year
i haven't been following too much of the
nhl since the canucks
uh roster is literally like a hundred
percent coveted positive right now and
will never play hockey again but uh
i noticed or i saw jack campbell
has won nine games in a row to start his
career
that's pretty sick
are you hoping the canucks are in trade
talks for taylor hall
um i think i would i would take like the
uh
i would take like the opposite approach
i think the canucks should be
uh sellers at the trade deadline for
sure
we have no reason to buy
yeah this one's pogon last time it took
us 40 minutes to get here
but last time we did also have um
let's go we did also have 1.67 damage
who do you think is gonna win the cup
this year i don't have a good answer for
you but something in my heart of hearts
is like it's
this is the leafs year okay so like i
see this
and i have the cracked key is that how
this works
no that's not how it works that's just
lore
okay fair enough good to know
that would waste it you have to use it
on the okay so maybe it's like a secret
room
hug that you can only use it on one time
something like that
i don't know there's just something like
i don't have a good answer for you
like i i don't know i mean if you knew
who was
he's the greatest gamer of all time hold
on could i could i do it anyway
[Laughter]
yes the man is a genius
my god and look at that so high value
we got to slip in between the walls um
five head move it's just like you know
if you knew who was gonna win the cup
you would be like a a billionaire right
you would just you know double your
money every year
or more than double but uh
i just something in my in my heart of
hearts so i'm like it feels like the
leafs have got it together this year
but i'm mostly admittedly only following
the the north division
so i don't really know what's going on
with the rest of the league like
the lightning there's still like a
powerhouse i guess and uh
f the uh hurricanes are doing amazing
bruins are frustratingly good as always
colorado's good don't don't talk to me
about vegas please
this is an anti-vegas community we do
not allow golden knights
uh fans to show their faces around here
log off thank you
okay if you live in
nevada doesn't even have to be the las
vegas area
if you live in nevada
then you're allowed to show your face if
you live in like manitoba and you're
like i'm
i'm a lifelong fan of the golden knights
goodbye
and by goodbye i mean you know you're
entitled to roof for whoever you want it
is it's only sports at the end of the
day
what if you're two years old
don't watch my stream if you're two
years old because
advertisers don't pay good rates you're
screwing up
my whole uh my demographic data
by putting a bunch of like you know
babies into the
demos i in particular i honestly i don't
think you should watch my content
unless you're 55 and older and you're
really into sailing
i think i've cracked the code for how to
get high
cpm advertisements and i i
really need if possible some boating
enthusiasts
like if you if you have a boat that you
named after
like you know raquel welch or something
like that
that's five people in the world yeah and
i want them all
hop in my yacht dude so honest
honest uh not even question
honest sentiment if you gave me
infinite money i'm still not sure i
would ever get a boat
i know that they're expensive and that's
like a predominant reason a lot of
people would not consider them
but it's also just i don't know it seems
like a lot of maintenance
you know like if i if i had infinite
money
100 percent and you can be mad if you
want 100
i would get a country club membership i
would
i would go hang out at the like i would
just emulate larry david's life
and play golf like five times a week and
eat club sandwiches that sounds awesome
but like i don't know a boat doesn't
like
doesn't really appeal to me i've been on
them it's not
unfun being on the water but uh
i don't know it just i i don't i don't
think i would ever be like oh do you
want to take the boat out for a spin
i just i i can't picture myself saying
it but you know things things change
i guess
would you get a private jet i don't know
because like
i think if i was insanely wealthy
there's a there's a
let's call it a
25 chance i would try to get my pilot's
license
i like the idea of flying for sure but
somewhat paradoxically would i get a uh
would i get a private plane i don't know
because i feel like
um i'm also a pragmatist
and i know how this sounds like this is
inviting problems into your life
but like major european
north american airlines are very very
safe
you know whenever you hear of a of a
terribly bad crash it's usually
a a private plane or a chartered plane
or like a regional
uh airline so i don't know i mean
i think if it still existed i would be
and we're talking you know
like you got like i don't know what's
eight figures maybe in the bank or
something like that
um i think i would be more likely to try
to get on that sweetheart deal
where you know i know they discontinued
it but you pay like a million dollars
and then you can just fly first class
wherever you want
that's more my my ticket okay tell
tell me in no uncertain terms how to do
this
you it doesn't matter you just you just
use it there
should i sleep or not sleep does it
matter
doesn't matter okay so and then this
chest this chest i just open it and i
have fun because it's a free item
is that correct
yes okay all right here we go
we open it it's mom's key welcome
we sleep in the bed because we can i've
been told not to skip this transition as
well
that's spicy okay then
we see this we use it
reach out and touch faith we have
unlocked eden and challenge number blank
doki doki literature club wait is that
so we unlocked
tainted eden yo
now we're talking i thought i thought
you had to beat the super boss
in order to get it oh they're just
giving them away
how about that dude the damage is so
much better
you need to try that oh i see i see i
see it punishes you for moving fast
now we're learning it's amazing how much
more you learn on a run where you're
uh actually strong okay i remember this
yo i think i speak for everybody when i
say this mf spitting
heavy rad jam energy too yeah try
dodging that actually is over confidence
that's that's just bad play
so i'm apologizing here but we're
skipping because we've seen this already
now we're in cuphead hours
don't no we've seen it
i haven't seen it you will see
go to jay's channel jay always uh he
plays all the cutscenes
i i very much respected jay he he
appreciates the uh
the cinematic nature of the game more
than i do by the way thank you han solo
good good day at the track
much appreciated okay they're bouncing
don't hit me
just notice the horseman chilling in the
background yeah
yeah well we got it it's like kill bill
you know we we killed two of them now we
got to get the other two
yeah they did a great job on this stuff
like it's
this is so far like above and beyond the
expectation of what like
you know the end of the game would look
like
oh you thought you were slick huh
that's not that's not good that's not
good i am i'm slightly skeptical about
our ability to win
but i'm still optimistic although with
nine lives i'm a little scared
that we're gonna die and have to do the
fight over again
and just instantly die
oh nine lives is super carry on this
fight oh
so it doesn't start us over from zero
that would be devastating
or if it started us on like the tv uh
on the tv boss
okay the flappy god has logged on
never forget people are still saying to
this day thank god
nl didn't get flappy bird in the
semi-finals against hafu and champions
of fire too
otherwise he'd probably still be in new
york in the time life building right now
playing
and you know what who am i to say that
you're incorrect
i do have a i have a knack for very
mechanically difficult games such as
flappy bird
and pac-man 256 all right that was not a
wise move
whatever
isaac on the other hand i'm still
working on
flappy bird on the other hand i'm still
working on
flappy bird let me be honest with you i
was glancing
whatever easy wind
the sky above cracked open and a white
beam of light reached down he's done it
again
don't get super excited i'm cause i'm
gonna skip it
i apologize but
it's like four minutes long man we can't
be watching that at the end of every
single run
i think i've got like adult onset adhd
like if i'm not doing anything for two
minutes like i gotta
i'm losing my mind okay slash marker



all right i mean we just unlocked
new eden there is a
i have to play as new eden i'm
people are also requesting the challenge
okay you know what
because there's so much chat unity let's
do that new challenge
what which one was it
you gotta hold all the way down oh it's
like hidden at the bottom here okay
interesting very interesting indeed
so is isaac with no music yankee with no
brim
here we go
this is gonna take 10 years doubt it
that's uh leo but it got hit by
gamma radiation
temporary damage consolation price
i don't know what's happening yet but
that's okay
uh i seem to be incredible at the game
censor peace be with you some nobody
knows okay
so i like everything's randomized
that seems to be the case
something along those lines pardon me
like everything you buy is 87 cents
everything you buy is not um
what it looks like and when you pick it
up it lies to you
okay i'm down with that idea let's let's
give it a shot
everything is everything yeah you're
darn right lauren hill baby
excuse me a little rude
any item could be plan c yeah but except
plan c which could be brimstone
this is not my damage up letting the
pogs wash down
let the bubbly keep me cold
into the bubbly again just got the
peachy flavor
once in a challenge
water flowing underground
press m twice and you'll get extra music
i don't know that seems like one of
those things that's like hey you know oh
your iphone broke just drop it in your
swimming pool and
you know it'll fix
we don't know what it is and that's fine
it'll be fine
we got music again look at that no no no
problem man i fixed it myself
i'm not gonna use it until yeah because
i want to see what we we got kamikaze
but also i think it gave us a bunch of
spirit hearts
thy enemy
blood recharge
i i throw my head yo it's it's cool
scissors
also i i have bone tears now
you know i think here's the thing right
like
i think this challenge appeals to me
because i very rarely know what i'm
doing in isaac like to begin with you
know what i mean
so the fact that like everything's mixed
up it really plays to my own strengths
i'm not concerned about this i'm so used
to the chaos and not understanding like
hey why does this happen
like i didn't know i did that jacob and
esau run and i had no idea
um
what was causing me to take so much
damage and then
you know it turns out that it was like
shard of glass
i had no clue man i picked it back up
and i still thrived i also still lost
but there was thriving being done
jj6 wooden nick
we might as well see what it does nobody
knows
um
d6jw pills plus baby
okay that seems horrible although it did
give us a temporary stat increase
but then we go down to the next floor
it's like the same thing like everything
gets randomed again
how far do we go oh my god chad don't
tell me
what enemy is does this go to
that's blue baby okay that's not so bad
i thought that was uh hush
i was upset you know what take some
pills man it's not like it's gonna get
any
like zanier although i should know
i was just gonna say if we ever get any
stat down like
that's a problem okay you literally just
don't take damage
okay literally just don't take damage
stop taking damage
yeah we got something out of this like
oh my god man
we got it we got a stat up out of this
blue bossy
uh is the scissors again
that's okay i'll pick it up stat up and
the loss of 4 hp
it hurts but oh your item is partly
guppy's paw
it's easy man this is an easy game
i'm probably gonna be fine
all items are random items combined into
one another
kind of like the movie annihilation when
you think about it right like when they
go inside of the shimmer
you know what i'm saying this guy this
guy watches video essays he definitely
knows what i'm saying dude
yo yo yo yo yo are you telling me the
only rock
that's untinted must be tinted
i really thought that that's how that
was gonna work i thought it was gonna be
like because it's zany
an untinted rock is the way this is the
way
there is a tinted rock in the other room
though
is there
i mean it's like it is a different color
is it tinted that does not look tinted
to me
i agree on not doing that i confirm
don't do that
easy too easy in fact
you thought this challenge could kill me
you were you were highly wrong
all we need to do we killed the boss
that shouldn't be too hard
after we kill the boss we get an item
that's it contains
abaddon well this one's got holy mantle
somewhere in there analog
s
arnold s oh dude we got some uh passive
abilities there this is pretty good
we got a health upgrade we got um
we got booger tears i think or some kind
of tear effect at least was in there
only when we use it though
i don't know man i gotta stop thinking
about like the way that we do this
and just do it instead if you just like
don't take damage
you're set
i guess every item comes with passives
yeah but they only get
used if you
if you they only used if you press the
space bar on that room or something
i mean beating blue baby is not that
complicated
you gotta think and not play okay just
thinking don't play
don't speak i know what you're feeling
and i don't need your
reeling just tell me because it hurts
how about less talk more play
tell me about avril lavigne i have no
ever levine stories really um
she did grow up in the town of greater
napanee which is uh
a couple of towns over from where i grew
up so it was like a big
hometown story when complicated started
getting played on the radio and then
you know she became one of the
biggest recording artists in the world
but obviously not really like my cup of
tea from a musical department
people think she's dead and her
doppelganger took over
oh you didn't know that's true yeah like
she did
she did die and her doppelganger took
over that's something we covered it at
like a
at a city hall meeting way back in the
day
she's been replaced you know why because
she got too uppity
she started to think she was too good
for uh for greater napanee and she's
like oh i'm going to move the
i'm going to move to california oh yeah
well guess what pod person
get potted
it's quite complicated in here please
explode thank you
have you been replaced yet oh dozens of
times
but they've swapped so much that i'm
back around to the original
you ever see invasion of the body
snatchers
what i see sack alter
donald sutherland exactly
i see sac alter
and i have no knowledge of anything else
i don't think we should have this
the sprites mean nothing
maybe that's why i'm built different
could have been boxes spiders
it does do plus h that's my favorite
stat h
how much
uh yeah i have no concept of what this
item does
i once every two rooms i get
disappointed
now i know how my mom felt when she went
to every parent-teacher conference in
high school
could be you know what it could be a
dice you're not wrong
it could be some dice element there
that's just uh that's not even corrupted
that's just a single item
t-melt lunch hp
purple cowards crystal what the what the
you can't steal my charge
uh am i insane this seems like really
good
monster manuel and a ton of spiders
every room
that's not bad certainly better than
what we just had at least
team out just dropped a new item piece
up team meltdown
t-melt is a an r b singer most famous
for his use of manual tune
and his his most popular song of course
uh
can you buy me a drink
do you know any father john misty songs
does father john misty sing the alex
jones parody that's like
hillary's in the creepy weird sick stuff
man
that woman number one is ugly
imagine how bad she smells man
that one that's not that's not is it in
the style of
father john misty
why do you know the words dude i've
listened to that at least 50 times
it it slaps and it's all so funny it's
like what weird al yankovic
wishes he was it's a heck of a bop
you could farm spiders in empty rooms
you know
normally that's like a cowards uh
mindset but for now
i think you got like a i think you got a
great point to at least do it for a bit
what's the biggest fire you've ever seen
in person
it's a great question i don't have a
great answer though
i've driven by some cars on fire i guess
and probably some houses on fire i don't
think i've ever seen
like uh like been up close and personal
with like a blazing inferno though and i
consider myself very lucky for that
t-mount is broken man oh yeah one time
to my surprise
a hundred stories high
people getting loose y'all and my boogie
starting to flow chain reaction
i don't remember the rest of it anyway i
heard somebody say burn
baby burn disco inferno
oh yeah maybe you've heard of it it's
called the sun
we're sticking with this did it say nl
board spectral nl
wasn't even looking team melt is like
it's one of the most overpowered items
in the game
can you banter about banter i mean it's
not you could banter about anything
including yourself like it's not like a
it's not a paradox
friend control a passive item i
actually did not know that there were
passives in the game
the thing about banter is that people
like sometimes and
it happened it used to happen during the
nlss all the time but people will be
like
you know oh stop talking about the game
start bantering
you really can't like just finesse
banter like that like you can't
deliberately create it
in my opinion at least or at least you
it it's a struggle to do so
um i think what you got to do instead is
just like be in the zone
if you're in the zone you can banter
about anything once you're out of the
zone though it takes a while to get
yourself back in like there's a
different set of rules to talking about
something coherently and seriously than
there is to
to bantering
like i watch some other streams and and
this is not a knock on them
you can take multiple items passive
items they exist
but like there are i don't i don't know
if there's a tinted rock man
to be honest it's a six continent
but like some other streamers someone in
chat will be like what's your favorite
kind of pizza
we got we got money tears and they'll
just be like new york
and then just like then there's like 45
seconds of silence
and i'm like that's not what your
audience wanted they want to argue
like they not in a negative way but they
want you to give your opinion
so that they can be like pog or
alternatively
what the you know dan's game
why are you just answering them with a
straight question you got to answer them
with like a little
it's got to be a little tease on it
afterwards
yes sir exactly what the
dan's game exactly
that's it that's what i i came to terms
with this when i was
thinking about tearless you're
absolutely correct
as i realize that the reason people like
tearless is because
they get a chance to argue like no one
has ever
looked at a tier list and their initial
reaction is
another passive let's go dude why not
right like
why wouldn't i it's not like
no one's ever i see it all the time
because people put like hey here's my
like cereal tier list
nobody's ever like nice list it's always
like
how dare you put raisin bran crunch in
this tier versus this tier et cetera et
cetera
as long as you embrace the fact that
that's the energy for the
for the tier list i think you're fine
if you're gonna be mad about it then you
know
you gotta cultivate a different vibe
yeah i have no idea what's happening on
this run but like
i we i don't think there's anything to
tease apart i think you just got
ascended
don't be silly i'm just gonna send it i
have a bone
uh i don't know what's happening i am
cash register noises it's like i'm
playing king of retail again
you're t melting fools man ain't that
the truth
dude i'm mad so somebody reminded me in
check because they said i'm still mad
over
uh pulled pork over italian beef or i
don't know what it was but
something similar um so i you know we
have this lunch delivery service
i got two different lunches delivered
this week
and i didn't realize that
i was like oh spicy ginger chicken rice
bowl
that sounds up my alley
received it at my front doorstep looked
at the container a little bit more
closely
chicken is spelled c-h-i-k-u-n
and then the number one ingredient is
uh soy
that's really bad and i lost tea melts
which like i'm not anti um
soy but
like i mean you know my position on this
i just
prefer if i'm gonna eat vegetarian
cuisine thank you monkey's paw by the
way
that it's not like hey we tried to make
the normal dish
but without the key ingredient i prefer
if they were like
sometimes they throw in like some
falafel and i'm like that's sick
and then i'm trying to think there's
there's other like oh you they make like
these awesome like chickpea wraps and
and lentil wraps that are on like
grilled naan and those are fantastic
but uh when they're like hey we turned
like
soy protein into something that looks
kind of like chicken i'm like
not so much it's just it's not it's not
my vibe
so i gotta knock that stuff out i mean
i'm not telling you to stop it i'm just
saying like when i go to the app later
today i'm gonna be like
please remove these from my cart
okay so i've been told every time we use
our space bar
that's sick every time we use our space
bar
we take damage to get a big damage bonus
that's spicy i gotta we're just chilling
for now
come on just just stay alive okay
i did that with a can of tuna once i got
to know by mistake
that was such bad damage i i was so
flabbergasted by the idea of something
called tuno
[Laughter]
i.e
tuno is real i i also like it's not
fair right like and i'm not trying to
rain it down on on the vegetarians and
the vegans
because i'm sure there's times where
you're like man i could really go for
like a you know japanese rice bowl with
some chicken in it but i
can't eat chicken so i'll take like
something that's kind of a reasonable
approximation of it an actual tinted
rock exists
um and i'm sure like there's some meat
replacements that are pretty good you
know
like i haven't had the impossible but i
heard it's awesome
uh the beyond is pretty good i heard
justin's been talking up
soyrizo he says that it's it's quite
good
um but like i just
it irritates me once like when i open it
and i realize that it's
the vegetarian or vegan version and then
it
a second time irritates me when i read
it and it's like you won't believe
it's not chick dash on not real chicken
chicken rice bowl
and i'm like bro
i like i was already mad you didn't have
to write it
in such a way that it makes me even
madder
because trust me like i'm gonna
no is not chicken
because it doesn't look like chicken or
really tastes like chicken
dude you're right we should pepsi test
it
chicken baby yeah yo apollo another
partner streamer baby partner streamer
tuesday baby yeah
i saw you playing it takes two apollo
it's kind of hard though like because
you must have been playing it like
single player right because
like i was really looking forward to
that so you were just testing it out for
like when we're gonna
when we're gonna check it out
right like i'm just waiting
for your reply
oof baby yeah oof baby tuesday cringe
baby oof yeah freaking cringe baby
freaking ooh baby ooh look at this look

bob had a baby it's a boy
what the heck i didn't get hit by
anything
jerry jerry i'm getting hurt
what was that
i think it's bad but i don't have any
control over it
because it was a passive
okay rock tinted i'm gonna need you to
be real loud since new floor just
dropped
excuse me
team held curse the run i wish i just
wish i hadn't gotten rid of team out
like a fool
i didn't know how good i had it man
i don't even know what i died to okay
but now that we know what we're doing
slash marker second
try all right we are back
on on this challenge we're on the cellar
one
also known as the dark room

the mobile blues again

off-the-cuff parody of my life i was
like that was genius
yeah also let's go the baby let's go

zoomers and the uh

what track one is

tracks instead if you're into that
i think it's good early one morning the
sun was rising

tangled up in blue baby yeah mama's
homemade dress baby you you know the
vibe
wait a sec just wait a sec i walked bob
dylan
about on stage
this must be the straw and something
else
academy of art and design san francisco
i'm an nyu film school graduate
feed tea ah i'll give him baby
you just told me
jay all right
um yo we got sulfur
we got cool sulfur i see your cool
sulfur pogging through
that's pretty good i see your cool
sulfur that's why i pog a
tinted rock back there you know what
i've decided hp
might be important so sure in the l room
oh cool tinted rock
look at that yes sir
okay sorry i'm gonna stop saying it
my friend went to a bob dylan concert
and he just played keyboards
look i've i've said this many times i
got a lot of respect for bob dylan
you know blonde on blonde blood on the
tracks
uh highway 61 revisited even
some of the old the newer stuff like
modern times is really good you know
that martin scorsese bob dylan
documentary that came out was was
fun as well what am i doing i'm bad
dragonreborn614 thank you for the gifted
subs thank you
wamana helping her but what i am gonna
say
is uh lock up baby question mark luck up
what i am gonna say is i uh
went to see a bob dylan concert he
played in my hometown
in uh maybe 2008 and it was one of the
worst concerts i've ever been to in my
life
but what did i expect
going to see a concert of a man who's
literally 80 years old like
i expect he'd get up on stage and start
you know like smashing guitars or
something like that
rip sulfur somehow that's fine maybe
maybe we never had it to begin with
we do have full mapping though
somebody check on that guy in chat and
see if he's okay i walked bob dylan up
okay we sorry you can't um
yeah it was it was not a great concert
but like if we're being honest like the
reason that um
which one the guy who said hahaha in all
caps it's funny because he old he old
it's hilarious hahahaha
just make just tap them on the shoulder
and make sure that like
yo buddy you alright just a quick
wellness check
um
most of the reason i feel that everybody
went to see the bob dylan concert was
like not
that bob dylan was gonna um
like tear the roof off the place it was
just to be like you know
i live in a somewhat small town or
at the time at least we don't get like
super
huge artists like ever it's a once in a
lifetime thing
so you go see it because he's because
he's there but then elton john played
once too
and the tragically hip uh did their last
concert there
which was uh more of a bop i was not
there but i watched on the cbc
much more of a bop than that bob dylan
concert
hey hey okay baby elton john baby
bridges
now we're talking passive item bridges
so basically except for the tragically
hip
everybody that plays there is 30 years
past their prime
no um but the famous people who play
there are 30 years past their time
what's happening
that that much is absolutely true
i mean like i'm just being real with you
like if you're
like a big time uh
artist and they're like hey do you want
to play like a gig between
toronto and ottawa
i think when you're like you know at the
top of the world like when you're taylor
swift
you're probably like no
but when you're doing you know my 75th
farewell tour for real this time no cap
i can see through walls
then maybe
i i can't see anything please be dead so
i can leave
the walls the floor so
is the floor they pull your
hair up but not out to turn into a
mannequin another
shot at life if they pull it out they
turn to
bones
sorry i wasn't trying to be negative all
right
apology accepted
it's no problem no harm no foul ah
but ah okay look it's got a one room
charge i'll give it a try
yes sir you already know the vibe can i
get a bomb a
bomb and bomb on a bomb yes sir i can't
forget the bomb you know i gotta cop
that bomb yes sir
i gotta admit it is pretty sick
hey dog i heard you like
bombs so i put a bomb in your bomb so
you can bomb your bomb
absolutely hate this
i would let me out
[Laughter]
the real isaac starts here what the heck
man we got isaac's heart now and he's
chilling
oh he took damage though oh but can you
oh you can kind of get him to stand
still look at look at the dodges man
this is the item people were like is
asked here oh isaac's heart is actually
like
run winnable now it's just like a little
familiar that's still
risky i mean better but
come on man come on
get me out of here look at the door's
not even working
edmond what are you doing the shadow on
the door got broken by data miner
i'm not a discerning consumer but some
people would be very upset by that
could you rotate twice yeah but in what
direction
get bombed guess what guess what
get absolutely bombed
get bombed i'm bad
get bombs don't don't tell harry thank
you as well for the gifted subs
hallowed grow our back fantastic
peter don't tell harry
i got the relic baby once every four
rooms i got the relic baby
and i don't have isaac's heart and
there's a tinted rock in the fight
that's pretty useful
okay i'm calling it right now i will
actually give out
100 gifted subs if we get this 0.3
double deal chance
i'm willing to risk it all
saved i do it it gets my heart rate so
spiked
cl
[Laughter]
so close yeah you don't even understand
like it's not about the
money it's about like having it look my
wife in the face and say i spent 700
canadian dollars on subs to my own
channel
i mean i guess you'd rather give them to
your own channel like from a
financial standpoint but
is kind of like pointless for sure yes
sir
okay infinite bombs might save us here
and the occasional bone smack
mr bomb back there
you think about everything don't
beautiful bomb look at that
great story mark and tell you a story
i used to know a girl she had a dozen
guys till one day
one of them found out beat her up so bad
she ended up in a hospital down on
guerrero street
tommy wiseau's reaction
what a story mark whole
i am a spider
i don't know if this is any good but
we're here anyway did i get a spirit
heart out of that
hey
i'm still a spider
this challenge should be called i might
as well the run
that's kind of how i feel again like
this i i'm having a good time i can't
stress enough the fact that i don't know
what's happening is a very
usual feeling for me
so this is just this is normal what'd
you have for breakfast this morning
i had a kind bar um and then for
lunch i had sichuan style
spicy pork which again
because the meal prep service is
operating on very thin
margins
it uh it's about two pieces of pork and
10 pieces of
uh tofu but that's okay
you know i i as long as there's a little
bit of meaty flavor in there i got no
problems with the tofu it's merely when
they try to replace it
you know buy one of these real quick
tofu is kind of pogged you know like i'm
not an
anti-tofu and and when i was uh a
vegetarian i ate quite a lot
but i really i genuinely believe like
tofu as
tofu is fine tofu is a meat substitute
it doesn't appeal to me that much
this is gonna take literally a billion
years
unless ladies and gentlemen we kind of
got him
ladies and gentlemen we got him again
i've decided yes i've decided i don't
care about dodging anymore
why don't you just come over here and
i'll hit you with a bomb on the corner
it's i mean this is pretty bad
no this time i would not give out any
subs for uh
for a devil deal i mean that's just
asking for trouble
so like i'm just struggling right
because like i can't
i'm i'm having some trouble hitting you
i do appreciate these corners like i
never knew how valuable the corners were
on this boss fight
come on come on
stay still we're closing in
unblockable undodgeable
brimstone laser
and this setup is pretty bad man like i
don't even
don't don't beam me come on don't be
me bro i can't the spider is the
strongest enemy in
gaming lore when is screw
attack gonna rank single spider
in the binding of isaac repentance
saved by the way god he's good
okay no sweat
internal d6
okay i gotta admit hold on this seems
kind of sick
i don't know what it does but it seems
kind of sick
this challenge is insubordinate and
churlish
confirmed guaranteed signed and
certified and
validated by a notary public
i watched the video that you said where
the uh
the guy says an artist respects the
silence of creativity the
the silence that serves as the
foundation of creativity
uh and the guy seems like an a-hole i
feel betrayed
oh yeah like i don't know maybe maybe
this is on me i didn't make it clear but
like
the whole point of the video is that
guy's an a-hole for sure
that's the entire point
he's not a nice guy
he did all he i i do love and i know
we'll tease this apart over the coming
weeks when we analyze the video
i do love that after being like insanely
uh formally verbose
he does say i'm an nyu film school
graduate
sucka
still still classic okay so corey i see
that you're here hello corey
perhaps you could explain to me what the
heck's happening and why
uh laser-guided missiles are spawning on
and every time i pick up a consumable i
take damage i guess
[Laughter]
to terry gg laser tees
get me out of there dude
gg laser d
just give me some money dude i got i got
bloody penny give me some money
hold on guys adobe creative cloud has an
update
did you hear about this
nine cents the floodgates
what does this mean
i take damage every time i touch it man
but i need red i need money to get red
hearts dude
what the no
the polaroid fate chosen heal me
healed but hurt but healed
invincible invincib enemies endless
enemies
no
it's like okay i i'm starting to tease
it apart every time
i pick up a consumable it
spawns enemies
and hurts me but also now we have the
polaroid
and the bloody penny we need to get it's
like i can't pick that up if i pick that
up i'll get i'll get hurt
it had an attempt had to be made him
we need we need that red heart
i'm invincible pick everything up pick

er
okay we're going in mom fight please
don't create consumables
tinted rock no
if i even touch the golden chest i'm
gonna get hurt dude
sonova
i think we stand no chance like this is
this is truly formidable
on the other hand imagine
imagine that the glory
focus brief radio silence never hurt
anybody
remember if you pick up anything you're
gonna die instantly
just place bombs
you never know when the feet are coming
down
going on flying guys okay here we go
again
i mean that one was essentially
impossible
i don't know how you like we we hit a
level
at that point where it just couldn't be
done hello chibly
what are you talking about red flag
hobbies
i was right by the way like i was being
honest with you
hold on i gotta see what you say here
slash marker
you know if you're telling me to split
up the videos a little bit more for
farming let's do it okay slash marker
clip farming run
um i forgot what i was saying
oh chibly red flag hobbies like a
hundred percent
if anybody uh in their twitter bio
says that they love like rationality
it's an extreme red flag because those
be the most
irrational people i've ever met quite
frankly
i'm like really you're like in love with
rational thinking and then you're like
sitting here arguing with me
over like you know what size shoes sonic
the hedgehog wears and you have sources
to back up your data like
that's like the most irrational thing
i've ever heard of
size six
i'm just enjoying this part of the game
where like everything's normal
is taxidermy a minkus hobby
um i mean like it would it would
definitely surprise you a little bit
um i guess because it's unusual but i do
almost feel sometimes like uh
like so like it's the same you ever like
see an interview with somebody who's
like a funeral director
they actually with a few notable
exceptions
seem like the most normal people on
planet earth
it's like they're they recognize they're
like i'm just doing a job and it doesn't
really gross me out so i think
you know i was the right person for it
uh rady and vic by the way
nobody tell apollo nobody tell apollo
that
the dyer have been real quiet since this
new cursed item just dropped
we also do have full visible
red flag hobby is somebody with no
hobbies
i mean like i i actually you're gonna so
much of chad is gonna be upset because
they're gonna feel seen right now
but there's some truth to that there
have been times in my life where i've
really had no hobbies
and like as soon as you find yourself
putting like watching movies as number
one in your hobby
you better have like an hbo subscription
you better like have some criterion
collection blu-rays because if you're
just like i do it sometimes
that that should not be number one in
your profile
six gj uthpicks this is a 12 room charge
demon baby my reflection the co
what the heck
tears that seems pretty good
viola mercurius
oh that's so good
mercury is that's incredible man
me can do okay i mean we okay
we gotta test the actives man so let's
let's walk into our first room here
oh okay we'll be i'm telling you
we will be rolling with mercurius
although succubus is quite nice
i don't mind that vilka
mercurius
oh that seems fine
what's your hobby i mean right now like
my hobby is like
investing for sure and i'm not bringing
it up
as like a flex i just it's it's like
less
what your hobby is and more about the
fact that you have like something
outside of work that like you're kind of
passionate about
it can be a red flag if you want it to
be i'm not looking for friends
we're full up right now
you ever see the cable guy you can just
call me matthew broderick
why
i don't have friends they disappoint me
run good don't pick up any more items
no come on you can't do that it's
cowardice i think like
almost any hobby except like well what
about
murder okay obviously not murder i think
almost any hobby is cool if you're like
cool with it
you know that being said i'm like
you know warhammer's kind of a red flag
but you could you could buck the trend
i'm not i i know some cool people who
who are in the warhammer i do also
i've had some people that i know they're
into warhammer and i'm like
you kind of ruin it for the rest of them
but it's a box oh
vum slash hmm i wish i didn't take it
quite frankly
i think any hobby can be cool if you're
cool with it
good thing i don't have any questionable
hobbies
look here's what i'm gonna say apollo
you're you're at a stage in your life
right now i
i support i i get the joke by the way
i support your the way you're
valuing things right now you know
you're on a wave ride it you know that's
that's my advice
but as you get older and they're
releasing uh among us
27 repentance the really final one for
real
this time edition by the way i have no
idea what's happening but this is
incredible
you know you might find yourself in a
position where you're like now i gotta
cultivate like a life
sort of like outside of what's going on
inside of this computer or i'm gonna
like lose my mind
it's kind of like where i'm at right now
that's why i'm like reading more books
and like taking walks
hoping something strikes me you know
so we make familiars when we kill things
i think we don't take any more items
since well i mean of course we're going
to take them
out of damage plus hp up feel forever
i choose to take nothing here
saved
what have you done to this video game
that it suffers so
um
we uh we're doing a challenge that
doesn't exist
and like i i really
don't know fully what's happening
but i do know that this is actually
an incredible setup right now and i'm
not going to mess with it
leostam huh no thank you
well that's what i like when people i
mean and you know look
the rules for are for the not for me
right
like i uh i'm i have the permanent
banter license which means i can
gatekeep as long as it's in the service
of entertainment
that's why like a secondary reason i get
annoyed from uh
time to time when people are like oh nl
used to be into
programming and you know then he was in
the lifting and then he was in the
investing it's like i can't trust this
guy anymore well it's like you know
you got to understand it's harder for me
to find a hobby than it is for you to
find a hobby because i can't just be
like watching myself
you know and and have people instantly
know that i'm a man of uh
positive taste you know i got to
cultivate some diverse interest because
i can't just consume my own content to
carbon copy your personality
i got to read the jack schwager's
seminal novel market wizards instead
watching nl huge red flag huge red flag
yeah you know what else is a huge red
flag canada's flag switzerland's flag
red flags some of the best
flags denmark
japan
just read the intelligent investor no it
i mean i i own it i've read a little but
it's boring as sin
i'm sure it's packed to the gills with
interesting data
but it is like it's really boring
it's truly it's a tome
saved get him
fun investing book uh yolo your life by
the winklevoss twins i think that
that one taught me a lot
rich dad poor dad rich or dad poorer dad
um
by the winklevoss twins that's a good
one
diamond hands
diamond hands was a classic
i mean if you have diamond hands is a
foundational work of
of the current investing movement so
like if you haven't read that like
i don't even know why you're watching me
of course we'll take it m return no
thank you
who is diamond hands by
stonk lord
i know how to do this
told you um
you read any novels nl no but
last night i did read
the wikipedia synopsis for all three
books in the three body problem series
and i gotta tell you i couldn't put the
i couldn't put them down why
because this long like the books are
long man
in the original old english
i'm just gonna take damage i've accepted
it
saved
and i understood what was happening
have you read anything on five factor
investing oh man like if people thought
investing talk was boring to begin with
wait until we get into the idea of five
factor investing which is underpinned by
the
hypothesis of the efficient market
theory is actually correct
and then you know the only way to get
extra returns is to uh
maxim or increase your risk and risk of
course in this case is not the risk if
something goes to zero it's merely a
measure of the beta which is the
uh correlation that a stock or any kind
of equity or
you know financial instrument really has
with a broader market
and then you know how do you maximize
risk-based uh
risk uh adjusted returns well it's very
simple you simply have to find
you know the smartest betas and sorry
i'm sorry but yeah i've been listening
to a lot of the rational reminder
podcasts it's very interesting i think
they do
i think they do good work not just
because they're canadian apparently i've
been
i've picked up an item and we're going
to die um
but i i kind of think we were gonna die
to begin with
to be honest so i'm interested to see
how this goes
i'm interested to see how this goes
ooh car
[Laughter]
this is a bad start
all right well



all right finally after getting
sidetracked
a little bit yesterday with with the
zaniest challenges
it's time to play a zany eden oh no
ever changing so maybe we're still gonna
be
uh zany i thought this might be a little
bit more conventional but i'm not sure
that's the case
i'll tell you though we do start with uh
with sacred hearts so there's that
i don't know what happens with this
character we'll figure it out
over time um maybe every room she
changes i don't know
we'll find out is so zany
zane incoming not every room
confirmed not every room uh
nl did you see the post about the
seinfeld
impossible hallway i did see the post
about the seinfeld uh
impossible hallway
i i mean it was it was a curious thing
to look at
uh and and what were my thoughts at this
point
of the seinfeld impossible hallway my
thoughts are
you know it's filmed on a soundstage
it's not filmed in a real building in in
new york city so
uh of course it's uh it could be an
impossible hallway but i
admittedly i had never thought about it
it does kind of break your brain a
little bit right
no way filmed on location
this seat is cracked i'm feeling pretty
good
i mean like i don't know where the run
goes from here but i mean like even the
shops are
are coming up milhouse right now he said
the thing
like look at this man this is crazy
that was debunked it is possible bro how
can you like a debunk
a a fictional hallway
like how can you debunk something that's
not in real life
it's not like did they did they visit
the real seinfeld
building i don't understand how can it
be done
to a space two of clubs no
judgment yeah justice yes
hero fun yeah two of clubs
not yet not yet we say not yet
every time you take damage
everything changes okay
okay here's the thing though this run
is actually still really good
you know i'll take buddy in a box
because my my thesis
is that everything changing means the
more items you have the better off
you're gonna be
oh you can still get breakfasted now
that's an interesting
that's an interesting theory
yeah i wasn't planning on taking damage
today anyway so no no big deal
no you can't get breakfasted even better
yeah yeah dummy guess what we already
ruined our
our cool little run there but we do a
book of revelations now
donkey dunk
i'm still feeling pretty good about this
like the more items you have the the
easier this run is going to be i think
only items you pick up count towards
breakfasting re-rolls down
all right look that's all well and good
but this is like it's beyond my level of
expertise
i'm mostly like a like a like a dodge
the bullets and
uh shoot bullets
kind of guy when we get into this talk
about like interest rates and bond
yields and stuff like that
i just hit the snooze button i go back
to bed
i asked this question in dan's chat
but who do you think would win in a
fight
uh derek you or edmund mcmillan
i said this in dan's chat as well i
think it's one of those things where
like if you're putting it in marvel
terms edmund mcmillan is like the hulk
like i think it's very difficult to do
damage to him and he's got incredible
hurting
power but then derek is like doctor
strange
like i think derek could concoct a world
of
of subterfuge to
play mind games with his opponent
now who would win in a fight between the
hulk and doctor strange it's not even
close
uh dr strange would win because he would
just make a portal
when the hulk punches and then like
slice his arm off but
they're not really the the hulk and
doctor strange they're merely analogous
to the two
so the way i look at it is it's like um
help it's like imagine if they were in
the ufc
octagon i picture like derek is gonna
rig up
like punji sticks and like explosive
traps and stuff like that everywhere
but edmond's just gonna keep running
straight through them like the jug or
not
he's gonna be he's gonna be like only
modestly affected by the explosive
damage
so i i honestly like i've been playing
it out in my head i think it's like an
eternal battle
i i don't think i don't i don't think
they could hurt each other
i don't think ed could get close enough
to derrick to to do damage
but i also don't think that that derek
could do enough damage to
to dissuade edmund i'm gonna get weird
like let's
he said it he said it let's take as many
items as possible right
let's take as many pills as possible
like i'm walking on sunshine
yeah unstoppable force versus a movable
object
they don't allow punji sticks in the ufc
well yeah not until
uh well but something something if dana
white got his way
[Laughter]
um
we take as many items as possible we
wish to live i don't know anything about
dana white
except he's not the same person as joe
rogan
but it does seem like they were built
off of the same
blueprint you know what i mean it's like
a like a pepsi versus coke sort of thing
they should that's how your eyes should
actually be be tested
it's like at what this at what distance
can you reliably
discern dana white from joe rogan
because i'm telling you if they were if
they were 250 feet away from me
my eyes would see them as the same
person
if they were six feet in front of me i
would 100
i'd be able to tell every single time
there's six inches of height difference
yeah but i don't know who's
uh taller probably probably joe rogan i
would guess
i was confusing dana white with vanna
white i was actually gonna make a joke
about how like they should get married
by the way like as long as we're
carrying like this manic
energy in here um i still
and i'm not mad at you guys but like you
kind of screwed me
um i still think that one of my most
underrated tweets of all time
is when i said you expect me to be
worried about automation
taking my taking our jobs away when
vanna white still has a career
i mean literally like she just taps
letters
any student could uh you know write a
program to do that in in no time
flat and then people were like
not people but like a couple of people
were like uh her job isn't to hit the
letters her job is to like be a hottie
and i was like yo bro
you're jerking off the wheel of fortune
huh
well you know any any port in a storm i
suppose but i don't know if i'd be
openly like admitting that stuff on
on main or whatever nice self-report
yeah exactly
okay we'll take it i told you i'm not
taking any more damage
caught suss dudes who are down bad
red flag hobbies
how'd they catch you in 4k
this is indeed tainted eden
money is cool but that sounds like a
miserable job heavy disagree energy i
would love to take
vanna white's job i mean like
look are you are you generating like a
ton of satisfaction
from uh you know hitting the letters
probably not
but you're doing the task like sometimes
it's just fulfilling to do a task
successfully even if it is easy right
that's why i always talk about how like
my dream would be to just
okay i didn't i didn't think this
through but it worked out beautifully
my dream would be to like be allowed to
go back to
like fifth grade and just be the
valedictorian
easily like i it wouldn't be that
challenging
but like at the same time it would feel
good to just be the best you know what i
mean
like i think that would be a ton of fun
by the way i don't know
in fifth grade some fifth graders might
have a better knowledge of like
uh mathematics than me at least fifth
grade mathematics i'd have to like
relearn long division maybe
but i will tell you something guaranteed
nobody's
coming even close in uh public speaking
if we have to do some public speaking
like
they're getting thrashed you ever
even the best like fifth grader when
they give a speech is like george
washington
was the first president of the united
states he is noteworthy
for uh establishing the precedent of two
terms as being the limit uh for
american statesmen and i would get up
there oh my god i would have like a
i'd have a whole song and dance plant i
could i could filibuster
okay we out here
would you be like you though or younger
yeah like in my head it's like a
neurolinx sort of thing right
like like i would be
my brain but in my own 10 year old body
which is also doubly good because i
would still have hair
i mean we're going all paths we're going
to try to go alt path anyway
why not we shop wednesday baby
how much american history do canadians
learn um
the the smarmy answer that's definitely
also
real is much more than americans learn
about canadian history
but it's it's not as much as like you
might be led to believe
like most of the american history i know
is via either having lived through some
of it
at this point in my life um or like you
know
listening to podcasts and audio books
and
you know stuff like that and and then we
have a lot of like shared history
with with the us i mean i look don't get
too
no don't get too big of a head over this
but like
over the 20th century a lot of work
and well actually from like the 18th
century onwards a lot of
world history has an overlap with
american history you know
like it's it's hard to tell the story of
of what
you know the earth is like over the last
300 years without talking about the
united states as well
so there's you know you kind of learn
some of it ambiently just because it is
a country that has a
you know disproportionate effect on
world affairs
so you learn like not a lot but like
it doesn't matter what you pick up here
and that's all i got really i don't i'll
be honest i don't think canadians learn
enough about canadian history
i feel like i know substantially partly
my own fault by the way
but i feel like i know substantially
more about american history than
than i do about my own country's history
hmm i i i recognize him getting hit more
than i'd like here
think we just leave
yeah the canadian history is like and
then you know
at the same time that they were like
doing all this nasty stuff in america
everybody in canada was getting along
except for the british and the french
and then something something fur trade
you know something something and then
and then all then we invented basketball
like that's been
pretty much canadian history in uh
at least when i was in school
it kind of it mythologized being
canadian for sure
but i think that's true of uh you know
most countries
i'm guessing at least certainly some
in england the british empire never gets
mentioned in history class
how how can you do that though i don't
understand
what's british history then i mean i
gotta be honest like
it seems harder to be a student in
europe because like aren't your history
classes like 10 times longer
like look you can get as as broad or as
narrow in the history as you want
i i support this reroll but like at the
end of the day
you can cover like the broad strokes of
canadian history in like a couple
semesters
i feel like if you you know you're from
france like
isn't it like a lifelong experience that
you're going back to like you know
the roman era you're holding the grudge
against caesar for
conquering like trans alpine gall
canadian history at least like the way
it's taught in school
is like basically starts
in like i don't know like the year 1800s
what the heck is even that
i mean this just let it roll man it's
brimstone bombs of course
he did conquer part of gaul yeah i know
i i listened to pi i told you i'm i'm
very intellectual i listen to
numerous podcasts
i'll have you know i've listened to over
300 confirmed podcasts
your survival in this debate is not
guaranteed
my brimstone bombs
where does illuminati rank
i don't know what i must have had sharp
plug i guess because when i hit the
button i rerolled
um despite not having a charge uh
that was weird anyway uh don't don't
tell mathis i've never listened to an
episode of
chilluminati it's just not uh and i
don't mean this in a negative way it's
just not in my
interest realm you know
like i it's doing great stuff he he
seems to be very happy doing it i would
never be like don't do it but
i'm like you know all this stuff's fake
right doing an episode on like the
sasquatch come on man
people are dying kim
there's some episodes about true crime
oh now we're talking
now we're talking
have they done an episode about bitcoin
yet
i don't even know like is that a dunk i
have no idea
because i've never seen an episode
i got no clue man oh what the okay the
the mimics i have to start blaming
myself
i do just keep walking into them
no you don't even want to know like the
i literally like so i listened to
um hardcore history i haven't listened
in a while but it's a very entertaining
podcast
don't even know what this item does but
sure oh you you shoot blue candle tears
that seems pretty good
um
it's it's historical veracity i know
people have like
some people at least have an issue with
it but it is very uh
it's entertaining at the minimum um
and i listened to a finance podcast
called the rational reminder podcast
that i'm gonna tell you like
one percent of you listening right now
are going to be like that's exactly my
jam and the other 99
are going to be like this like if you
listen to it for five seconds you're
gonna fall asleep
apart from that i just been listening to
a lot of audio books like i got debated
last night i
i finished uh i finished thinking fast
and slow by daniel kahneman
and it was like people who like daniel
kahneman also like this book by daniel
kahneman
and i was like a pog a daniel kahneman
book that i've never
uh i've never heard of and then it's
because that
it doesn't come out on audible till
freaking may dude
baited
is nl trying to die nah man
even harder i'm trying to live
remember when people read books instead
of listening to them so
who's the boomer now chad like i don't
know what's your point
or is the point just like you know why
do we walk on a or why do we park on a
driveway and drive on a parkway
like remember when like you took like a
horse and buggy
to your office instead of like driving a
car
whatever happened to the good old days
man
remember when instead instead of sending
your friend a text
you you wrote your message down on a
piece of paper and then shoved it inside
the quiver
uh wrapped around the ankle of a carrier
pigeon
and then uh whispered something into his
ear
and then threw him into the sky and then
hoped that your missive would be
received whatever happened in the good
old days
okay we we were committed to doing this
alt path
but my commitment knows about
come on man like get me out of there
that's just that's too much
that's too much i mean we might as well
try to do
the the knife piece that's not gonna
hurt us too much
i'm just saying man like you know i saw
it reminds me a little bit of like the
sparkling water debate
people were like you know sparkling
waters trash i saw it was middle east
one person out of 6 200 people but one
person is like
audio books are trash like just get over
it okay you don't have to feel like so
strongly about such minor
things i promise you it's going to make
your life better
it's a very strange opinion to have like
i like
i don't even want to ask you about like
what you feel like your evidence is for
that like what's
because it seems like it's not even
based on the quality of the
the audiobook is like a piece of art or
a you know a
knowledge or a you know a textbook or
whatever it's more like oh
like a guy who listened to audiobooks
stole my girlfriend
or something like that it's just like uh
it's like a heavily weird
energy man like it i gotta tell you if a
guy who lives in the audiobook stole
your girlfriend
like the person whose fault it is the
least
is the audiobook it's probably mostly
your fault to be honest
but also your girlfriends and possibly
you know the guy as well but
i just saying you got to examine your
own role in the
in the system as well you can't just be
blaming you know
random house audio book productions
send it send it don't send it walk it
back receive it
that was just terrible but jokes on you
you just rerolled me into something
amazing
probably at least it doesn't reroll the
knife piece
so i'm gonna i'm gonna get insane you
wanna see how insane i'm gonna get check
this out
i thought that would hurt but that's
fine i realize
now i can fly i'm about to get loco dude
look at this
what the heck it's like all of our stats
went down but the run seems better
it happens it's more likely than you
think
go ahead take it
the only way you lose these runs
consistently
is if you stop getting zany if you
decide like you're gonna try to control
the zane
you're already dead what you have to do
is just
rank your zaniness above the coefficient
of zayn
pardon me twice of the of the game
if you can be zanier than the game and
roll with the punches you'll win
it's like driving you know on ice okay
if you start this skid and you hit the
brakes you're done for
you lost all control if you look where
you want to go
and i'm looking where i want to go which
is the alt path if we can survive long
enough to get there
um if you look where you want to go
and you gently push the gas in the
in the direction that you're looking
you got a chance to steer out of the
skid
dunk dunk yeah exactly it's ashby's laws
of
requisite zane
the run can stay zany longer than you
can stay solvent i disagree
the run can probably stay zany longer
than you can stay solvent
but i'm the universal solvent
be like water jeet kune do okay
don't get too attached to that one
what the heck is this can we hold on
what is this
there's a golden ladder here
i've never seen this before in my life
go up it's an angel store
what i have never seen that before
that's
incredible
what the heck we got a judgment in here
where'd you come from
i'm i'm buying i'm buying don't sweat it
dude i'm i'm buying
and orlando amazing chest ahead
alges close enough it's because you got
that sick ladder in your inventory yo do
i get that every floor then
if you get that every floor that's
disgustingly good
that's amazing until you give up all of
your money to
uh get nothing in return but uh and plus
we're gonna get hit and lose it but like
you know it's the principle of the thing
the tower
i'm not afraid
yo it's not the best run we've ever had
but the shots are pretty strong no doubt
about that
we got the full key as well
i don't know man we could fight mega
satan we could do the super alt path i
don't even know what's happening right
now
this is crazy
anyway that's my thoughts on audiobooks
is like
they're i like them i've been taking a
lot of walks with the baby
and like podcasts are great but
sometimes you run out of episodes right
and that's where you need an audio book
to
to fill the to fill the gap hello
it's baby time
baby time hello it's the baby
hey
baby baby
no
it's the baby um
i know how this is gonna sound i i
honestly don't think i can be killed on
this run
because getting hurt benefits me
so like how are you supposed to be
killed it's like that katy perry song
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
yeah yeah exactly
she knows it that's not katy perry who
is it
oh kelly clarkson from 40 year old
virgin
i can't can i oh no can i hit you with a
controversial take on kelly clarkson
uh since you've been gone great song
nobody's debating that
see she knows she knows um
every song she's done since then
insubordinate and churlish
party party in the usa that's miley
cyrus
this is my fight song take a back
my live song that one
not a good song i have insubordinate and
chirlish
wasn't there chad can you help on this
one
kate says kelly clarkson has a party
song
her christmas song is a bit of a bop
heavy kelly clarkson christmas
she won american idol one
came in first be justin guarini made a
movie that
was kind of dumb
she's not loving it how many times have
i gotten mom's coin purse dude
i i mean i sing all the time i sing a
lot of the similar songs i would say
frog likes to hop hop hop comes up a lot
you know flat
that's that's what i remember that one
the baby seems to respond very well to
the beta band
and uh mom's knife mom's goodbye mom's
knife
super knife to the beta band and also to
steely dan that's my baby intel right
now
if you need the baby to uh
i i thought i heard something that's
some heavy can you close my office door
on the way out please
thank you because i think it might be a
conversation happening there
if you need the baby to calm down you
play some stilly dan
let me just see what's going on out here
oh it's not it's just an
amazon package no big deal i mean like
again i
i've talked about this before
many people are under the assumption
like i'm not one of the best isaac
players on earth
okay show me how one of these like uh
22 year old speedrunners does when they
get interrupted six times a run they're
reading a thousand lines a second in
chat
and also the doorbells ring in uh
you know they're they're looking the the
their baby like
in the eyes and feeling like that level
of spiritual fulfillment like it
it just has never happened you can't
show it to me oh crap small ants here
smaller you know what i was with it and
then
until they changed what it was and it'll
happen to you too
how long do you think those pencil
sharpening muscles are gonna last
you know you you can't stay young
forever even peter forsberg had to
retire eventually
my brother recently got a kid any advice
for us
um so like when you say god
what do you mean
it's amazing that in the english
language
my brother recently had a kid
even though had is the past tense of to
have
is how it's supposed to be god which is
like to receive though
is like you go oh no no no no he did not
recently get a kid
english is weird man this has been your
daily uh
this can't be done i think this has been
your daily
um english's weird take
look there's probably a better way to do
that but
science hasn't figured it out yet
acquiesce there you go acquiesced
now i'm the semantics phd king look at
me
i'm the phd now bro i was reading
something online yesterday
tell me if this is true so somebody was
like hey i have like a good job right
now but i need financial planning help
because i'm about to get my phd
and i estimate it'll take five to six
years
is that true
five to seven i honestly thought it
i honestly thought a phd was like a
two-year marty
i thought you got like a four-year
bachelor's two-year master's two-year
phd
is that not the case
not at all that's crazy man
oh another tinted rock look at that it
it's closer to four to four that's wild
that is adorable yeah i too thought it
was adorable when i
exited the comfort uh warm bubble of
academia
and and set out in the private sector
to improve the tax base of my nation i
thought that was really adorable
when i left the bosom of of school and
instead
entered the real world i thought it was
adorable
don't try to academic gatekeep me i'm
not a phd but i've been reading books by
doctors okay
and not medical ones
do your research sweetie yeah
hey hey i wa i may not be in the real
world now but there was a brief moment
when i taught english as a second
language in south korea
and well no when i worked at a summer
job as an insurance company not as an
insurance company but how sick would
that be
um okay tiny plan is doing some stuff
for us here i get you know i'll just
take it
okay grandpa let's get you to bed
yo we still have sci-fly
how the heck did that happen yeah you
know that's a great point do you do they
have dr utker
in in america or in europe for that
matter
or in the other parts of the world that
are not north america america and europe
because like dr utkert doesn't even make
sense to me how can you be a doctor
and sell frozen pizza
isn't that like a conflict of interest
by the way i don't think i left the
trinket behind anywhere i don't know if
we can actually do
like the alt path but here we are oh
wait this isn't even the all path anyway
i'm just going to the corpse what am i
talking about
yeah i never could
oh just a dumb dog is online on
origin dude he's gonna
dude maybe he wants to play it takes two
do you think we should send him a
message see if he wants to
because i've been looking to start the
game maybe he would be interested in
playing some with me
he wants to play with steve
um my name is ryan you seem to have me
confused with
somebody else
steve is an isaac item not a real person
f f
dude this run is actually going oh right
we got to fight all the waves
look more like a mark
don't get up there i don't know what you
do i was in the pool
your name's steven too no that's why i'm
so freaking confused
no this is not balls this is somebody's
elbow joint
show some respect
it's an elbow chat chad it's an elbow
trash
it's satire
take it anyways for the reroll no
because i actually feel like
and comedic timing could get me pretty
good here but
i don't want to take it because like
seven seals could hit me
and if it hits me i'm gonna re-roll but
all right well i could have taken it in
hindsight
by the way i have a triple digit money
counter um
and brimstone what's what's up with that
what's happening that's deep pockets now
they changed it
did they make it so that the donation
machine doesn't pop in a single uh
hit did they recently add more hops
all right well this this should be a bit
of a
a spicy fight but i'm i'm excited either
way
pop it there you go get in there do
something drop some bombs you never know
what kind of bombs we got here
i know it was coming hey you know what
i've i accepted what the
heck
what he's playing pong with me do it
again lemonade pitcher
okay does this mean we get all alt path
weirdo here which means he starts
summoning enemies instead of doing
brimstone stuff
nope by the way i think we have marked i
really
yeah we have marks i've been hit by
by something allegedly
holy mantle holy mantle's the ticket
cannon corn
can of corn just remember what would
malf say mouth would say can of corn
can of corn baby isaac's heart thank you
for leaving
you're okay oh that was a good one too
my hp
i lived get the heart oh
frick
not like this
no respawn me no not outside the room
not outside the room
we are dark judas temporarily well i
don't even know what his health is at
but it must have been so close to
him being dead because he was like
40 dead by the time we pivoted off of
spider spidermod
and this is an amazing run
but we know we're gonna get hit so again
you know i gotta remind myself
we kind of just gotta like okay well
that does not help
um oh cause we're not super eaten
anymore now we're dog judas so we don't
reroll the whole run
which means word oh no
yeah we didn't get any unlocks because
we didn't do any i mean we left it all
on the line for the corpse unfortunately
um we could we could have definitely
just
you know gone to like the dark path or
something like that
but you know we we left it all on the
line and i'm not afraid to have done
it judas unlocks then
yeah but like i mean we're gonna die
[Laughter]
this is a bit of a it's an attrition
play
we got great dps but the the dodging is
not what it used to be
it's all right still a good run
regardless
i mean i think we got our we got our
zane sorted out we can try to do like
some basic uh
basic unlocks you know some some stuff
uh i mean i'd really like to knock out
some of the challenges
just like get some positive momentum for
sure yeah 0.7 speed is not
is not amazing i wouldn't dispute that
are mostly pretty tough yeah i don't
know if i want to go straight back to
the zayn
uh oh dude i don't know
we're pretty sick here um so yeah i
think we should i think it's a good idea
let's try to unlock all the old
characters
challenges are fun but we can do them
whenever
donkey dunk
dunk donkey dunk you know what you
asking ye shall receive try to try to
unlock tinted
bethany after this
why not
we can give it a try
tainted kane is cool too
wish me time to cane
can a corn mashed wine kind of corn and
i'll
i just wanted a can of corn master right
i broke it that can of corn
that's michael kane but he's he's edgy
he's like the joker
we live in a society
i know the impression is trash because
nobody's talking about how bad it is
they're just talking about isaac instead
which just means they're
they're bored you know artists
an artist
an artist respects the silence that
serves is a foundation
for creativity you know artists
i'm muted i'm dead head eyes i'm dead i
mean if you could just give me like a
couple spirit hearts
couple spirit arts i might be all right
it's probably better than this
you're no artist terry you know i'm
something of an artist myself
that's not this sounds nothing like
willem dafoe
do bombs hit
buttons bombs buttons
battlestar galactica this is a foolish
endeavor do not do this
okay
send them we can dodge this
i don't know what's happening because of
sensor it's slowing the tears
not not by much not by much
but it's something
just when i i generated some hope oh
dude that was not that bad
that did not take as long as it as it
could have
there's some belief to be had here
i don't know what's happening
yo the slow is actually like it's it's
just enough
the dps is also pretty disgusting
i knew that was common but that's fine
we got we have plenty of hp still
plenty of hp to back them up
i can't believe it i can't believe it
[Laughter]
all right i mean i don't know who this
will i guess it'll count as an unlock
for judas but i think i already did this
as judas
done all right i don't think it'll be
tainted judas because
that was just dark judas but still hey
you know
heavy slash marker there slash marker
who'da
thought



trying to unlock tainted bethany it's
just that simple no
no rewards on that last run but well
played regardless
who would have thought that the uh
that the bomb judgment would be like our
ticket to victory right
not me
[Laughter]
i don't mind
so we gotta unlock special character
to unlock special character we can just
do a normal run
yeah just make sure you leave a trinket
or an item behind that's it
you leave it you leave a trinket or an
item behind
and you're doing great
i can't use my space bar item oh because
i have no money all right hold on
hold on i don't know how this is gonna
work
and money is like of it has some value
we might as well use it on a room with
actual enemies
of course but
okay now we're talking we we got a
pseudo money synergy here
we got golden fires remember that song
golden scans
yo when they die they give their money
back
what the heck
that's an unbelievable synergy it's
busted
i don't even know i don't even know what
what to do but it was very positive
though
like so every time we lose a money wisp
we're gonna get the effect of the item
ended brand new money
wisp that seems incredible
actual pog confirmed
stocks
wisp laundering yeah the money wisps
they still shoot too
so this is like i i've had very little
negativity to say
book of virtues is a game changer it's a
lot of fun
and also like i love how it turns some
of the like truly useless space bar
items into something that actually like
has some merit
go ahead break my wisps
dingle break my wisps then go break my
wisps
okay i don't i don't like to lose the
blue ones though
if possible hey what the heck it didn't
create a penny on that one perhaps not
as busted as originally thought
now watch me whiz no we're not gonna do
that
now watch me nae nae watch me sip
my shot in nene remember that
thanks bad thanksgiving parodies on
youtube
it's my mashed potatoes it's the one
dish everybody hate those
money please
i don't want to take damage yet but i do
want to pick up like at least some of
these for sure
trying to pretend you didn't just say
that say say what s-h-i-t
a streamer saying something embarrassing
what site do you think you're on
i'll have you know this is a very
reputable platform you can tell because
the tonight show is making uh
is is opening their hands to join twitch
in uh
streaming among us
jimmy one of one of the top 10 jimmies
for sure
jimmy carter he's he's you know he's up
there i guess
part of no he's not part of the bottom
10 jimmy's come on
top 10 might have been a little much
this seems like it's going to be nuts
man
but he's definitely not part of the
bottom 10 jimmies
there's got to be some terrible jimmies
there's got to be at least 10 jimmies
who have committed
murders there's probably like a thousand
jimmy neutron yeah exactly he invented
the atomic bomb
james gandolfini committed a lot of
fictional murders
on the sopranos i i think i've never
really seen the show
so the fictional murders i'm going to go
ahead and say it not as bad
as real murders but at the same time
might have led to a culture that
normalizes murder and as a result
in many ways he's one of history's
greatest monsters
this guy this guy i want those man
i freaking want him twitter do your
thing
jimmy eat world hey that's the end of
the joke
very true bucky barnes also known as jim
exclamation point quotation mark bucky
quotation mark close barnes
he did a lot of bad things but he
regrets it so i feel uh
i feel you know honestly like he's done
his time
jim halpert so good at selling paper he
single-handedly
uh deforested the amazon way to go jim
way to go
good job jim wow you really you're so
good at your job you
ruined a bunch of carbon sinks on planet
earth but you feel really
proud of yourself buddy
anyway that's all the jimmies i know
it's probably all the jimmies that there
are
let's move along
i don't know jim halberty sucks as a
person i don't know about that
he seems like a like an okay guy in the
office i'm trying to think
okay look he does torment dwight
okay but dwight
i'm not saying he deserves it because
he's a nerd but dwight deserves to be
toyed with because he's like have you
ever seen the episodes where like a
little bit of power goes to his head
he's got to be knocked down a pedestal
best canned fruit
you know it's a great question
i uh there are some canned fruits that
are
much worse than their fresh uh
counterparts like for example like
canned pineapple so much worse than
than uh fresh pineapple hold on a moment
please we got some work to do
we can also generate a bunch of wisps
off our spirit arts temporarily which is
very nice here
um but i'm i'm gonna tell you canned
pears
like canned bartlett pears
are so freaking good
you could just like swallow them they'll
slide right down your throat
peaches as well at canned peaches they
get that
something about being canned in syrup
like it just
a canned pear is better than
a fresh pair 99 of the time
because i think the canning process
broke down most of the
the matter for you so you don't have to
eat through the bark
and honestly like i'm fairly pro pair
and pro pair accessories
what kind of pairs are you eating dude
sometimes you get you get a good pair
it's a little soft sometimes you get a
pear and it's like eating a piece of
firewood
with like a little modest sweetness to
it
oh we're playing a little game it's
called uh what's being printed it's been
a while
if you'll excuse me i just need to go
over to the printer here
just give me just give me a moment oh
i'm on top of the baby
toy here that says if you remove this
tag punishable by up to
90 days in prison it is a shipping label
who had shipping label
monday baby
you ever had a poached pear before i
have i i do like uh
i do like dessert pairs
that's my shipping label i doubt it this
this bad boy's headed straight to amazon
returns i don't even know what it is
yo here's i no i shouldn't even say it
what if you just read a book off
amazon really fast and then returned it
you ever come up with something and you
think it's like a great scheme and then
you realize it's actually just a crime
like i'm pretty sure that's just called
fraud
i think i just invented a very very
uh minor type of fraud
just go to the bookstore and take a
picture of every page
genius the perfect crime that's why they
won't let you have your phones out in a
bookstore they're worried you're gonna
take a photo of every page
just brought my portable scanner with me
dude i actually thought we got a deal
there with our like 0.2
chance and i was gonna be like thank god
i didn't offer gift subs
you could just get books from the
library
yeah but what if um you want to keep it
right
did you i was listening to a podcast
about blockbuster
did you know that uh you know when
blockbuster was still
in business this is just before
like things went really bad for them
like something like 35
of their revenue was generated by late
fees that's
insane man
i would it cost you like eight bucks to
rent
a vhs tape for three days how the heck
did they generate
so much money off of late fees
that's crazy
i knew it because i worked there for a
bit
that's how credit cards work too yeah
but i mean credit cards make sense
like you know for most credit cards
literally like nobody's well i
shouldn't say nobody but rarely do
people pay much of an annual fee
you know so you're like when you look at
the visa corporation you're like of
course they're generating money from
like interest and like processing a
point of sale and stuff like that
but a blockbuster you're paying like you
know you're paying to rent the movie as
well
son of a
used to be so complicated man they used
to rent like four movies and it would be
like okay
well the first two movies are new
releases so you have to have those back
by
sunday at uh noon
but then these other two movies are old
and busted nobody cares so if you could
just get those back by like next
thursday
that'll be fine you still you have to
like schedule it into your daily planner
freaking isaac baby yeah baby
in your palm pilot yeah oh dude i don't
some of the first little uh like snippet
of responsibility i had
was uh you know my parents would drive
the movies back to
blockbuster or the jumbo video in canada
and they'd be like hey can you take
these and put them in the
the drop-off slot and as a little kid i
would always be like so paranoid i'd be
like
i hope i put them in right then like
because i don't want like mom and dad to
get uh
you know dinged with the late fees
you know what you're absolutely right we
do need to drop a trinket in the boss
room
that's my mistake
as a kid you're kind of like you're
irrational like that right
you're not wrong that was like one of
the most pog it's not even a chore it
was a privilege as a child
because you got to put them in there and
then it went like
you can hear him like hitting all the
door all the walls on the way down
in winnipeg we had pika flick you know
don't don't ever tell daniel about that
he'll he'll never let us live it down
but
i do kind of miss the video store like
there's no denying it on like a well no
i okay i've decided i don't actually
miss it at all
now that i think about it because like
the vibe inside of the store was great
like if i was walking around and there
was like a video store i might go inside
and be like oh
popcorn stale stale popcorn and like
dirty carpet smell
you know i would never rent anything i'd
be like are you crazy six bucks
just get it on netflix for free
you want me to pay six bucks for this
like on netflix if i if i saw it i
wouldn't even
give it the time of day i'd scroll past
it in two seconds
okay not free but for the price of a
monthly netflix
subscription
for quad four doing some heavy lifting
implying
what more did you learn from the book
thinking fast and slow
dude honestly like i would recommend the
audiobook it's not even like
i mean it's kind of to some extent it's
underpinned in like behavioral economics
but i know just by saying that people
are gonna like self-select out of
reading it but it's just a really
interesting book about like you know
biases and and heuristics in everyday
psychology
like it's it's an it's just a fun book
one of the things i learned that gave me
something to think about is like there's
a thought experiment in it that's like
um
you know what would you take if i gave
you a
guaranteed 900
or
a 10 chance to get zero money
but a ninety percent chance to get a
thousand dollars
which one would you take and then you
flip it on its head you find that most
people want like the guaranteed 900
bucks right
then you flip it on its head what if i
said
i could guarantee take a thousand
dollars or so let me rephrase
guaranteed take nine hundred dollars
from you
or a ten percent chance that i take
nothing from you but a 90
chance that i take a thousand and even
though obviously like in both situations
the mathematics are roughly equivalent
most people
take the guarantee of the of the smaller
profit
but take the risk of a greater loss that
also carries a small chance of
of having no uh loss associated with it
so the the the hypothesis then or even
the conclusion that's drawn is that you
know when it comes to things that are
gained
you know people are kind of risk averse
like they're risk averse when it comes
to
profit but they're actually like risk
seeking when it comes to loss
which is maybe the opposite of what you
would normally expect
it's kind of an interesting it's an
interesting thing to think of you know
and that's just one chapter
we're going to swap these but
just an interesting book that's some
boomer okay go back to reading like
hunter x hunter vol
10 000 where the dudes like you know
four foot uh one but somehow you can you
know beat up giants and stuff like that
it's on hiatus that's a low blow
[Laughter]
sorry sorry i didn't know
i will say kate was like you know if
you're gonna like
because she reads some she reads like
some light novels and some manga and
stuff like that
um this is probably like six or seven
years ago
she was like hey you know maybe you'd be
interested in this and she
gave me like the first volume of hunter
x hunter
and i read like half of it and like just
like a little kid fighting a bunch of
like
praying mantises or something like that
and i was like i think you know
i i read maybe like an hour and i i gave
it a fair shake in my mind at least and
i was like you know what
i just don't think this is for me
i got nothing against it but like i i
really think like the more
the more people tell me like this one's
gonna be the one that's gonna send you
the the more i'm like
i i just don't know
it gets good a few thousand volumes in
well
you know i'm happy for the people that i
mean that's that's true like
uh for everything right like i've been
reading a lot of books
i i try to force myself to read the the
preface and the four word and
chapter one which is never like actual
information it's always like
six years ago when i was living in ann
arbor why had a thought what if
you know a fish was actually a unicorn
and you're like oh my god just come on
get to the point right
but like the first the origin story
never tends to be
like the the best right it's only when
they it they usually peak around the mid
i guess
or at least like shortly after the first
volume
yeah except for moby dick they said call
me ishmael
changed my life dude to turn that
boat into a whale funniest thing i ever
seen man
xl oh my god this run sucks
oh wait wait never mind it's awesome um
i thought this run was better than it
was but we have no damage upgrades which
is really bad
we did leave a trinket behind yes no
fear
but anyway yeah like i'm definitely i
mean wait now that i think about it
it seems like daniel connor is really
popular
so do people here know did his book
actually come out and it's just the
audiobook that doesn't come back
or doesn't come out until may because
i've only got one book left in the
hopper right now like i could uh
i could just pick up a physical copy
instead of waiting for the audiobook
no not noise right yeah noise
noise
he did win a nobel prize yeah but he won
the nobel prize in economics right like
it's
somebody wins the nobel prize in
medicine or like literature
or peace they're like a celebrity
economics is like
like didn't the first uh
nobel prize in economics go to the guy
who invented like you know
buy low sell high
freaking nobel prize baby
noise is out as an audiobook what the
heck man
i do have a kindle and i i like my my
kindle
um but i also like i'm trying to build a
bookshelf and
it's like this is the most boomer take
that i have but i would just like i
would
you know i mean it's the pandemic still
so i'm not gonna apologize for like any
hobbies but i'm like you know
i feel like having having a bookshelf
full of books i've actually read
it'd be pretty sick i could look at the
bookshelf and be like yeah man i read
that
it's a good feeling
that's yeah in your 20s you get you get
a bookshelf full of funko pops
now i'm replacing the funko pops with
with books
because i can just get the funko pops as
as nfts
i recently got captain uh marcus phoenix
nft one of one
it goes very nicely with my crash
bandicoot figure number 29 of 65
blue hyena crash he's holding the wampa
fruit
say and the nft chip is inside of the
base of that one
you do not have my permission to press
print screen
or to make any clips for the next 90
seconds
this is my intellectual property
i will litigate against you to the full
extent of the law
too bad i already got one
i'm gonna find a place i'm gonna find
the jurisdiction
that will punish you to the greatest
extent and i will pursue you legally
speaking to the ends of the earth
okay now this is how we win all right
we insanely disrespect our donation
machine
run and just pick up
a ton of money for infinite wisps
eventually
you know that's pretty good i don't want
to take it too much further than that i
mean we we hit it pretty hard
i'm also like dude portable slot might
be in a similar boat here
like it seems very similar to magic
finger but i'm gonna try to generate
wisps
slowly so we can get the maximum benefit
the
fool on the run
you know what i'm talking about the fool
on the hill
the beatles no i don't really know how
the song goes
to be honest with you please i need a
speed upgrade this is no longer humorous
i'm not laughing anymore
[Laughter]
oh sorry sorry sorry is it good you ever
see skype laughter chain though
no
it's a great video skype skype laugh
chain
it's not that good it's pretty good i
mean there's no hunter
uh x hunter uh from volumes 18 to 21
which is when i hear it really takes off
for real this time
but it's like it's pretty humorous
maybe a little cerebral for the average
person
excuse me sir could i acquiesce the
slightest bit of damage please
you know what that's that's great intel
you can take the negative
and you'll get a little damage
thank you for the the feedback i
wouldn't have thought about it otherwise
fool me fool me once shame on you
yeah but you lose it in this next room
what are you talking about willis
we're free we're free go ahead you're
gonna lose it immediately what are you
talking
about
maybe you'll lose it but i think you
already know where i'm going with this
one
something something built different
step on it oh dude gimpy
mommy
yeah um like so i'm just being straight
up with you guys
i don't see how we uh how we stand even
a slight chance to win this run
i think we have both default tiers and
default uh damage
[Laughter]
so uh
you know we got a little time
that's true it's not about winning it's
just about unlocking uh
the other characters so i guess we treat
this as a win but we do still have to
beat
um the bosses like we gotta live
which i don't think is gonna be too much
of a challenge but you know
we'll see
i have been quoting the joker a lot
because i find it humorous
oh you think the joker is funny like do
you think it was funny
like all the crimes he did
right dude doesn't he say we need a
better class of criminal i've been
saying that all the time
apropos of nothing at
you all to know how i got these scars
it's just the thing they i oh man
i just wanted it i give anything to get
vaccinated so i could just go to
comic-con and
be at the joker cosplay meetup do you
do you want to know no do you want to
know how i got you want to know
how i got these scars
do you want to know how i got the how
did i get the scars jerry
how do you get the scars george nobody
minecrafter boom um i mean
i feel like maybe this will make like
some explosive
flies and like or wisps i should say
yes it doesn't i don't know man it
doesn't seem good enough
hold on we can at least use our spirit
hearts
you can have what
the heck is that that's going on out
there
my god he's good they're gone
jerry they're gone
sure man sure puzzle master puzzle
the master of puzzles has logged on
give me combat please like this is
getting absurd
they do anything do you do anything
you're not doing anything
wait
they don't do anything
oh if you shoot them they explode ah
okay that's way too much uh
there's way too much elbow grease for me
i didn't want to shoot because i was
worried they would blow up
okay yeah yeah yeah no i'm not even
sweating it like this is honestly one of
my most
the most comfortable positions i think
it could be in except for the fact that
i got a
quite a full bladder right now
let's go back and get some hp okay i'm
stuck
that's fine we'll live here
this is my favorite song
found myself screaming in a hotel room
evils of lucy was all around me
your music saved me
i remember you was conflicted
something inside that you wanna say
say it right it'll be okay it'll be all
right
we left it behind don't worry about it
nl singing over these parents in the
background it's a little too close for
home for me
just start singing some brady bunch

candy corn we'll be all right let's all
go for a walk outside now the summer sun
calling my name i hear it now just can't

that the brady bunch were the greatest
band of all time but sunshine day

family
they were people even though their names
were birds
there was a father and a mother and
danny bonaducci
he went on to box other celebrities
and now here's a story
danny let's go
we're free uh
did he drop a trinket
okay we're using bombs for like
everything man
you need more money no it's about it's
not about the money it's about sending a
message
and we need the messages that we need a
better class of criminal
um tommy needs trinky
gone off the bubbly oh
what do you get when you cross a society
that hate the demonizes people that play
on easy mode
with a developer who's not afraid to
make people pay
you get what you freaking deserve
oh my god dude do i have 3.5 damage have
have mercy on me
whatever i'm not scared

would have been awesome it would have
been totally fine actually
um so yes
and then you pop this algae's rune
i mean this bff makes your does it make
your wisps better
does it matter because we don't have
like wisps anyway
oh baby is speed upgrade
okay i'm trying to do i don't know man i
guess like we take bff and nothing else
like tarot card or tarot cloth is close
but
we don't have anything that works with
it yet and we're also not trying to live
we're just trying to live until we can
unlock the new character
nice something sunshine day

just like trying to get her to stop
crying i'll sing like smith and jones
forever by the
by the silver juice and it gets her
going because it's right in my register
it's not exactly in my q zone is it
okay good stuff good stuff
still alive keeping it going
you don't have to hit me with question
marks you can just type it into google
and it will bring up a band
it's not a bad word i think people use
it in a bad context a lot of the time
it's not a it's not a bad word in and of
itself
do star trek
no that's not the one don't scram that
star trek to boldly go where no
man has ever gone before
i can't i can't find it i can't i can't
find the star trek next generation song
in my head
all i got is the theme from the rockford
files which is actually like
i gotta admit quite a bop
but it's definitely not star trek
what about andy griffin you're actually
the youtube audience is gonna
like leave they're gonna leave over this
one but you know they should know by the
way if you're watching
on youtube like i mean come on i got
base damage and we're like an hour and a
half into this run like it's crazy
it's like a dude
i i mean i could whistle it but i don't
want to flex
also it sounds like really uh whistling
does not sound good at the best of times
but especially sounds bad uh into a
microphone
bro just like let me out this is crazy
i've already told you
as well my opinion on whistlers
can't stand them i i'm a good whistler
but like whenever i come across somebody
that like
you know they're in the grocery store
and they're whistling i'm like wow
somebody's got a high opinion of himself
i think i would want to hear like you're
out of tune uh
whistle along to like bad romance or
something like that
like just just respect the silence that
serves as the foundation for creativity
can of corn baby can of corn you know he
can't whistle
don't even try i'm a gaga stand dude
don't even try with me
what about this ski resort i could take
it or leave it okay
honestly i could leave it right now
because they're responsible
for a lot of the spread
we sleep we open
and then we hit the cracked key
saved saved saved
we needed to wait that would have been a
that would have been devastating
if we hadn't actually gone through with
it
time to die um look we've already been
we've been through this
um i mean i think that this run
really proves like
come on man if if you could unlock this
character
on this run you can essentially unlock
this character
on any run i mean to be honest their
space bar was actually
pretty sick
i'll give you that the space bar was was
had some heavy pog energy
for a while at least we're dead
you gotta music is the space between the
notes call
uh um debussy
claude his name is not carl debussy
[Laughter]
dead all right well dude honestly like
i'm pretty
i'm pretty content with that run like i
thought we did a really good job all
things considered i can't i can't be too
upset about that
all right we'll put a slash marker in um
end of unlocking
tainted bethany



here we go we unlocked tainted bethany
on one of the worst runs i've ever seen
in my entire life
uh we start with -1 hp so that seems
pretty bad
blood power and weaker items and then
the item is called let me get on lemme
jettin
all right well the good news is that uh
items can't get any worse than what we
just had
can i run something by you i'm scared
you know what liz
that my item is in the bottom right
corner
what's up with that little loki
okay i
i don't know why the book is in the
wrong corner
and it's it's freaking me out man okay
so every time we use
let me get on
oh cause it's a permanent active item
okay
um every time you use the item you get a
use the book you get a random item um
you seem to get it for maybe the whole
floor
maybe it's like monster manuel style
and then yeah i was just gonna say let
me guess red hearts charge it and you
can't get any red heart containers
now we're talking 24-hour active item
permanent baby
all right i'm i'm picking up what
they're getting down here
well red hearts drop a lot more than
spirit hearts so that's like a that's a
positive
it's permanent until it breaks the wisp
catch the spirit break the wisp duh
whisper don't know sorry okay we don't
need to sing because we
we sang a lot on the last episode um
but that was when we had no items so we
had a good excuse
so it beats me how this is gonna work
but that's fine
rat jam yeah ratchan by the way
this seems really cool
thus far i don't what do you do with
this item again like
i i can't remember i always get it
confused with golden teleporter
okay so once every six room teleport
that only takes you to weirdo rooms is
that correct
oh that's uh the wrong button and that's
just terrible news but maybe we'll get a
teleport out
oh okay hold on
hold on teleport me
love to see it teleport me
they did it they that is right they did
it
we might as well do a diamonds because
we're not sticking around
saved it also charged up our space bar
item there that's interesting
never punished oh check this out never
punished
yet again i remain unpunished
hey now i just watched episode 7 of
repentance
i just wanted you to know there is a 100
chance macho man randy savage says
play time and not me time i appreciate
you coming to the side of reason uh i i
couldn't agree more
he absolutely says playtime you can see
his lips come together
in the the telltale plosive of a p
instead of the the muted nonsense of a
ma
we will take matchstick i mean why not
go alt path man
alton path
i always thought he said pain time it's
one of those things this kind of like
is is sending me for a loop
because of the fact that to me it's so
clear that he says play time
but other people are like i heard
different things it's is
it's like the yanny laurel like or what
color is the dress debate and stuff like
that
do you still talk to your college
roommate um
no but it's not like i mean it's it like
we're not estranged or anything like
that like he's part of this like
you know google hangout that's uh
like mouth and josh and i are in of
people that you know
we've been friends for like over a
decade
um
sure why not uh he just he doesn't
talk in it
but he's like he's in it he's doing it
don't get me wrong he's busy
like he's he's doing some big time stuff
but uh we're not as strange it's just uh
saved we have we haven't spoken in a
while yeah he's a lurker
he's not as always online as as uh as
many people
myself included
ever since you got tapped to direct the
new spider-man film
it really is like that group is like me
josh
mouth and then like two other friends of
ours and even mouth doesn't talk it
much anymore unless you like if you add
him
he'll reply but he's like he's a little
lurker he's got heavy lurker energy
it's a pretty good run so far you
talking it i
i probably am the most talkative in the
group chat
that's because i have the most to
complain about
doesn't surprise me
yeah stop pinging us i hear you
but it is interesting to think like you
know it's it's like a gwyneth paltrow
sliding doors situation
i think of like a couple of different
like moments in my life that i didn't
know at the time had like a massive
impact on on how my life would go
there there's a few for sure and you
know everybody's got some for better and
for worse
but like one of them is uh when i was
about to move in
with uh like my friend from high school
after i came back from korea and then he
was like by the way my
uh my girlfriend's pregnant is that okay
and i was like no
absolutely i mean it's okay that she's
pregnant but i don't want to live with
you
anymore so that one
uh i want none of these by the way uh
that one was like
that had a considerable impact on my
life
and then the uh another one like i was
gonna live with my college roommate and
another friend of mine from college they
both lived in toronto i was gonna i'll
pick up the red hearts pick up the red
hearts you're not wrong i was gonna move
from
my hometown to toronto to live with them
and then this
this is like a sag moment so i apologize
but one day they were just like hey we
found the place but it's two-bedroom
only and we're gonna take it
so like you know basically like fu
and i was like all right i was i was
i was hurt for sure but uh as a result
of that
you know i was like well i don't want to
live at home any longer
so i moved out to to vancouver much
faster than i would have uh
expected i think i'm gonna blow you up
maybe this always gives you error rooms
i'm not sure
double double tap dash no thank you not
not in the spiky room
um
yeah so i moved out to vancouver
probably like a year or two faster than
i thought i would
it's interesting and i honestly think
that like doing that
like completely changed my life for a
number of reasons you know
one of which is like who knows what
happens you know if i hadn't
in in my personal life but then
secondarily like once i moved out of my
parents house and i had like
so many more responsibilities i
basically started
like not making one isaac video a day
and then playing dota with the other 10
hours
[Laughter]
but then like maybe i could dedicate
like a little bit more time to
work on a daily basis and then like i
think as my responsibilities
stretched you know so did my capacity to
meet them and and i think it's
uh i think it's changed things for the
better i think about it from time to
time
yeah instead i was like oh if i'm going
to play video games i might as well be
recording like all of them
yeah that was when like i and i remember
this happened a couple of times right
like
i mean this is very self-inflating so i
apologize oh baby
when i first moved back from korea i had
like no expenses whatsoever
so i was like dude if i like make one
video a day and that's good enough then
like look at how much leisure time i
have like that's crazy
but i think there's something to be said
for like having too much leisure time is
actually like
obviously having too little is bad
but having too much is almost bad as
well because you just get bored and like
don't appreciate it
as much um that's why i think like
people in retirement
sometimes you know they suffer because
they're like i got nothing to do like
i'm
the good times are killing me right so
then i moved out to vancouver and i was
like yo i'm like out on my own
obviously like paying for all my meals
and stuff it turns out like life's kind
of expensive
so i i you know started working a little
bit more then we moved into like a nicer
place in 2015
and i was like this place is crazy man i
can't afford this
even though i could but i was like i
gotta like adjust my work again
and then the same thing when we took on
you know this place
pick up the red hearts
and then the same thing with the baby
actually it was which has led to this
like new
uh you know twitch streaming schedule
basically
it's like you always gotta like
constantly be uh
reworking it in the face of of how your
life changes you know
don't no wait don't take my wisps
you took my cool wisp in fact you're
taking like all of my wisps
i have i have no items left i well i
have the passives i suppose
but still really good now that i think
about it like i actually
now that i'm looking like from a broader
perspective i feel like uh
how could how could tainted bethany not
be good you get all the items that you
would normally get plus the wisps give
you temporary huge buffs
like this is this seems amazing
yeah plus you can save the you can save
the red ones for a rainy day here
put it in your pocket for a rainy day
singing song and you know you're wrong
now you know what i'm talking about the
beta band
i don't remember the name of that song
though a plus b
equals equals pogs something like that
um
i'm going in
i'm happy i did
we got damage come on we got a damage
upgrade in the
form of synrobes and then also on top of
that we got this dang perthro man
okay we're definitely doing like full
alt path if we can
this is the strongest character in the
game right now dude let's go
what's the deal with the weird active
item okay but please rephrase and
try again as jerry seinfeld
what's the deal with this character
she gets wisps she gets items
it's weird that's not good
that's not good oh i mean you haven't
taken damage in two floors oh in that
case carry on with the compliments
isn't it just that vancouver is crazy
expensive by canadian standards
i would say yes and no um
i like all of canada is kind of like
screwed from a real estate standpoint
right now
it was kind of just the cities and then
like
you know scattered parts of the of the
country
and then like this year i mean i saw us
that
uh help
that's not what i meant to hit oh geez
louise oh no dude
oh god oh we still got teleports we
still got teleports
okay you hit this hit q
a couple of times to get strong there
you go take the fortune cookie just for
a moment
might as well use it but don't use it
more than once
and then pick this up you lose
we're not the lost anymore though so i'm
trying to think of what okay hold on
we because we're not the last we're not
the lost i'm not owned not the lost okay
um i i can at least yeah we can go true
ending we could try true ending that's
fine at least there's other ways out
um but i like i sent this stat to kate
that was like in 2020 like home prices
were up 30
on average across canada or something
like ridiculous
um but then like there were some stats
that were
almost even more insane like last uh
you know what we could do boss rush too
thank you
like there was a report that came out
that said
vancouver housing prices were up five
percent
between february and march which is just
like
you're like nah that doesn't make sense
that can't possibly be true but it seems
like the data bears it out and you're
like that's
that's too high even as as somebody that
you know has some equity i guess that's
uh
that's too high that's high enough to be
worrying
i get that like interest rates are for
the time being like
insanely low but still
i don't know what i was hit by
i'm not suggesting anything untowards
i just don't i don't know what hit me
do you think they'll crash dude i had
come on like what do i know
many many smarter people than than me
have uh
have already grocked the fact that it's
very difficult to predict this stuff
all i'm gonna say and this is not like
advice for the future
but the culture in vancouver in my for
my generation has definitely been like
since
2014 or 2015 people were like if you buy
now you're an idiot it's gonna crash
like you're gonna get toasted and it's
it's really easy to buy into that for
sure
because you're like the prices are
irrational like how can they stay
at this level like who can even afford
this um
but if you bought into that and waited
for like seven years
you set yourself back by like you know
multiple decades if you were able to
afford in the first place
like if you weren't able then it doesn't
matter too much because
you know what can you do but
you know if you had the means but you're
like i'm gonna try to like time it
properly then uh
like you missed out on a crazy run
that's for sure
we could try to fight mega satan as well
i know there's so much stuff to keep in
mind here
trying to just recall don't take my
charge
we've lost sack dagger
so we're trying we want to do boss rush
we're slow just quite frankly we're slow
for boss rush but we might be able to
squeeze
a little bit of time off um
by using
unknown it would have to like i at least
want to go to the
me in please i at least want to go to
the item room
and then we will grab this hit the space
bar immediately
did not take me to the error room
unfortunately but took me closer to the
boss
and there's a chance here we'd have to
go pretty quick
but let's give it a try and then why
don't we do like dark path
mega satan that seems
oh oh dude we just got okay so boss rush
dark path mega satan that's that's my
dream
curse of the tower okay if you could
remove that that would be sick
and i think we save our red hearts for
like for more charges later we don't
you know what we need to go fast save
them for boss rush
put it in your pocket for a rainy day
you could do hush hold on it's been so
long can we do
hush and then still continue on
no because i want to do alt path no and
i don't want to do alt path let's let's
knock out as many things as we can so
we're drawing it up all right i'm
drawing it up in my head right now
boss rush
dark path if we get to
the door in under 30 minutes hush
then we go full dark path kill the lamb
if you're still alive kill mega satan if
you're still alive
maybe you'll have a void portal and you
use that void portal to go
fight hush then you get an error room
that takes you to the alt path
and then you beat the alt path and then
you respawn
as you do a victory lap respawn is
another character
yeah yeah i'm starting to pick it up i'm
starting to understand i think i got it
all figured out
step one though is gonna well that's not
true okay hold on we're kind of screwed
right because if we try to go to boss
rush
if we do boss rush we're not going to be
in time for mega satan or uh for
for hush it's not possible
it'll probably take us 10 minutes to be
to be done with boss rush to begin with
robo baby 2.0 baby yeah baby monday baby
robo baby baby
stars card see ya later 2020
that helps you teleport out of boss rush
yeah but then we don't get the unlock
brother we we're here for the unlocks
please tell me this is the right way i
dude i haven't been hit i still have 10
luck that's crazy
four luck oh how about 10 luck oh buckle
ramone's voice 2020 20 20 20 20
20 20 20 20 23.
that is not how that word works but i i
think it's clear my last two brain cells
are like just barely
holding hands right now oh you can get a
uh
and get a bone hard huh
oh geez saved 20 20 20
until i go
still saved like whatever dude take my
boneheart like see if i care
nl have you had mini cadbury eggs yes
i am of the opinion though
oh it's going to be gone anyway i am of
the opinion that a mini cadbury egg
is is better than the large creme egg
not everybody supports this this
consensus but
yo does get out of jail free open boss
rush
yes okay well we could do that because
we're not going to make it
to uh both like we're i don't even think
we're gonna make it to boss rush
unless it no there's no chance uh so
we'll use that to open boss rush
hush too yeah but i i can't do
because i'm gonna have to use it to open
boss rush it will no longer exist
for hush you know what i mean
i mean we have we have 30 seconds to get
there
so you know what i mean
no okay that's fine you know we'll just
we'll figure it out
i do still have the luck how did that
happen
you ever notice how much let me get on
kind of looks like chet lemon if you
just cross your eyes
hello did i just realize did i just read
pac-man 99 comes out today
you did indeed um i'm very excited to uh
check out pacman99
it doesn't come out i think it comes out
at 6 00 p.m
and i honestly just genuinely don't know
if i'm gonna be able to like fit it
into the schedule this week but like
it's it's so
on the radar that it like the radar is
just one big blip you know what i mean
we got a bit of a quality problem right
now you know like the
the kind of problem you want to have
people love playing or watching isaac
like the numbers are
out of control they also love the
variety right
so we got some variety coming on
thursday via rainbow six siege we got
some variety coming on
uh friday via the overcooked twitch
rivals
but i gotta i gotta keep a steady diet
it's like the food pyramid
you know like sixty percent of my daily
intake has to be isaac
it won't last this way forever you know
like
in fact it's actually lasted longer than
i than i thought it would
be because like the the dlc is so robust
that was bad the variety will return
i i'm still updating my my twitch
schedule spreadsheet i'm adding new
stuff to it at all times
variety will be back we're gonna have a
second variety boom
thermite is then i still don't buy it
like he doesn't
thermite doesn't really look like dan
but 100
and i know i tweeted this already 100
pulse is pete weber not just the glasses
but the the hairline
the face like you can just look at his
mouth
i'm pretty sure they they actually
modeled pulse
on pete weber the bowler who said who do
you think you are i am
there's a little bit of an age
difference for sure
the cheeks the button nose
how's new dad life you look like you're
getting some sleep yeah like i
dude i'm basically we're just bragging
at this point but uh
there i want to start with the negative
okay the negative is that
she doesn't nap which is frustrating
during the day because you're like
you're tired she's like trying to
scratch your eyeballs out
um but she won't sleep during the day
unless i like you know take her out on a
walk then sometimes she sleeps
um so the days are like quite busy
she she requires some maintenance during
the day at night
literally we moved her into her own room
uh maybe two and a half months ago now
she has literally not woken us up once
in the middle of the night which is like
the kind of thing where you're just like
if another parent had told me that
before we had our kid i would be like
you're not
being sincere like you're just trying to
make us feel better
but she genuinely like as of right now
like she sleeps through the night
every night and what's crazy when she
doesn't
sleep through the night like let me
rephrase when she wakes up during the
night
she actually just like smacks the the
button on her mobile and turns it on and
then watches it
so like it's like the way that if you
woke up in the night you might like look
at your phone or something like that
[Laughter]
she she does she's she's got the giga
brain man and it allows us to sleep
so self-soothing on a whole new level
okay so i will say
somebody in uh in chat just posted the
wiki for get out of jail free
and the wiki says you can't
use it to get in but you can use it to
get out
this is going to strike some debate
up in chat for people who think they
know better than the wiki
and they might know better than the wiki
however
first off we're gonna go back and get
the card because i'm not even holding it
right now
but then we're gonna we're gonna use it
to get the hush instead
why don't we just use it to get the hush
instead
you are holding it oh because i can hold
two cards now yeah you're absolutely
right my mistake
i was looking at uh
i was looking at all this stuff like on
the map and being like how the heck am i
gonna
get in there
okay so we're not so in that case
i mean as long as the run is strong
i don't see a reason
not to pog out of our gourd right now
you know we i don't i don't think we
spam our red hearts for a basic mom
fight
absolutely not i think we
we load up and then use this on the more
difficult fights later
no deals though okay so we're going dark
path i remembered
i'm like i have not forgotten to the
best of my memory
once over the course of repentance which
is
is amazing for for my standards for sure
okay forget that man so okay what are we
doing
we are quite
simply we we're going to kill the batman
we need a better class of criminal
i gotta refresh my memory here okay no
matter what after we kill
um
it lives
we're going to
use get out of jail free to see if it
opens hush if it does it does if it
doesn't it doesn't
we're also hoping for an angel room so
that we can get a key piece and go find
mega satan
if it doesn't that's fine we got nothing
to worry about
so that's why i'm not using the error
room to try to skip they're using
uh unknown to try to skip this floor by
the way
i don't think it's necessary you know
i'd rather
get our angel chance here use bombs to
skip rooms
what are you what are you talking this
is a it's a good run
we still got qriket's head thank god if
you're using bombs to
to skip on this one like
oh i guess you're saying just to get to
the just to get to the boss quickly okay
i never mind i see what you're talking
about
now
i was about to accuse you of cowardice
instead you made
an equally uh dangerous sin
ambition
hey nl do you think the red hot chili
peppers are overrated
yes
i think you can think that they're good
and
i i still think you're gonna have a hard
time like disagreeing with me on that
one
like
is there anybody out there who thinks
they're underrated
probably but like oh what a what a whiff
does anybody out there like this guy's
not getting enough respect
i'd be surprised
whatever man sure that's awesome thank
you
it has to be done
if we don't get into the hush fight we
don't get into the hush fight mega
satan's more important
in fact i can promise you we're not
going to get into the hush fight
mega satan's more important can of corn
and i'll be all right
okay full key piece please thank you
take me down
i don't know here's what i'm thinking
okay teleport me to a second secret room
that's an error room
okay teleport me to a second secret room
to it to a second secret room
teleport me to the boss but hold get out
of jail free
he's done it the greatest gamer of all
time we got a minute
spam some things out there
we've only got four red hearts left oh
my god
time's not doing so bad here we're
losing the wisps don't get me wrong
thank you mom's heart for killing your
own minion please please
oh my damage
i really don't want to use it again
because we desperately are going to need
something against hush
done it don't don't don't don't don't
okay okay okay okay
um i really though i'm not sure i see us
beating hush
but dude what do i know it's been a long
time
we're here at least so we still have get
a chill free for
like nothing but okay definitely no
clicker
um certainly the speed is more valuable
than like an extra charge
what the heck is this flat file no more
spikes
we got enough bombs i'll i'll take a
stab at it
just use nod leaf
forgot about that conjoined
conjoined shower handle
okay hold on hold on
no no no i can't lose that
money
money
mommy we do have 13 red hearts now like
that
alges pear throw
f f
that hurts we also do have 10 luck which
is pretty sick all right
all right let me in please i think i'm
ready
like just just spam me dude
squeezy mommy
so i think for the time being do as much
damage as you can
and then if times get tough literally
i'm gonna like
put on uh
nod leaf with an orbital and i'm gonna
go crack a bubbly and we'll just have
some conversations here
the only positive thing i can really say
i mean the runs not bad but
the positive thing that i'll say about
this right now is like
at least none of our wisps are integral
to our success
we have like two tiers upgrades i think
so losing those doesn't set us back too
far
which is really just a polite way of
saying like
the runs kind of not great so we're
we've got less distance to fall when
things go wrong but
you lose the wisps if they take a
certain number of hits or maybe a
certain amount of damage
or usually like on contact with enemies
as well
but we're definitely not going
pardon me we're definitely not going
full
nod leaf strats just yet because i mean
come on like i got i got something to
live for here
you never know fart baby fart baby could
do it man
you always drop some bombs in there
does it doesn't do nothing
it does something
there goes one of them ah it's pretty
minor
my luck stead oh we we broke the bug
whatever that's fine we have a
matchstick out there
hush is a tinted rock bro do you have it
look i know i tweeted this earlier today
you're you you might have a really good
question nl did you tweet this because
you had goldfish crackers for breakfast
yes that's correct
um why because they didn't have anything
else
in the house that struck my fancy but
goldfish crackers
and cheerios
almost the exact same ingredients one's
a little bit more
sugar forward one's a little bit more
salt forward
if you eat cheerios for breakfast
everybody's like so true
if you eat goldfish crackers for
breakfast people are like frick off i
don't believe in that nonsense
like i don't understand why like what's
the difference
it says a lot about society that's what
i'm saying
thank you farting baby
would you eat goldfish crackers with
milk no but i wouldn't eat cheerios with
milk either so
it's kind of a false dilemma for me as a
result of my
uh bespoke way of being built
not wise not wise not wise
i gotta move i gotta move
starting to starting to not be too happy
with this but yeah yeah just go just go
just go
yeah yeah if you live go to shoal thank
you thank you
you lactose intolerant you little i'm
not lactose intolerant
i just don't like milk
gaming
almond milk though i just like i i don't
know i
i i reject the notion that cereal is a
is a package deal
i think you can just eat dry cereal and
i think it's fine
oh yeah this is doing numbers
really i just i resent the milk lobby
for tricking people into thinking it's a
healthy beverage
what about plain yogurt you can do
whatever you want just like get off my
lawn
saved okay
we go down the shoal okay now we gotta
live
that's the next step we gotta survive
so the way we're gonna do that is get
this guy to pay out with some delicious
uh hp and then he's gonna take that hp
and we're gonna re-roll it with pear
throw
and we're gonna turn it into the ice
cream scoop
can i get some confirmation on what this
does
[Laughter]
worst item the item room though
literally
like i mean come on this is like mere
seconds ago that we covered this
like did you not read the syllabus
okay down the shoal
it's damage up in peeper's eye for a
room
i'm not anti that
the wafer oh
just when i thought i was out they
pulled me back in
now it only lasts as long as the wisp
lasts but still
great movie by the way
dude
sorry i said no singing but that was
before i realized that this run would
also be a little bad
as per usual yep we got the world card
but no map yes sir
my wafer's gone no no no i see it i see
it in there
big chubby
what the heck when did nl start getting
12 000 viewers
it's it's finally the cream has risen to
the top
uh the people on twitch have recognized
that
like i'm the best streamer so it has
absolutely nothing to do with like
industry forces outside of my control
i'm thinking a lot of them came in from
that yahoo news article that was written
on uh
like a couple of weeks ago
that one did a lot of work for us i
think
twitch streamer comes up with hilarious
response to light troll in chat
my wisps yeah i don't want to i don't
want to do this room um
okay i've decided i will do this room
i mean we beat hush
i'm thinking i can sell cds
satan should be no problem dark room
plus mega satan
as of right now looks pretty ambitious
is that a jay z line it is a jay z line
you've got it correctly
you've correctly identified the tune
we i think we still have the wafer man
did you have any weird tas in university
um not really
i can't think of an example where i
where i had like a
a ta where i was like this person's a
little weird
i will say this this is ancillary this
this is secondary okay
but um on spring break one year i was in
like
10th or 11th grade
uh and ins because like i lived in the
suburbs right there was nothing to do to
begin with
so my parents sent me to like at the
local university there was like this
week-long
like enrichment course that you could go
through so like i went to it and then
there's kids from all over ontario there
right
hot shots from toronto yoko's from north
of highway 6 you know
sorry north of highway 7 it's been a
while um it was a great mix of like
you know cosmopolitan sensibilities we
had a great teacher you know taught us
a lot of stuff over the course of the
week and stoked our fire for learning
um and at the end of the
course one of the kids like took out her
nikon cool pics and was like hey teacher
can we get a group photo for the memory
bank which i guarantee they have never
looked at again
um and uh he was like yeah sure but can
we make it quick i just got a phone call
that said my best friend just died
and we were like oh
we like still took the photo though
which i'm not saying like we shouldn't
have it was just like i'm not even mad
at the teacher like he was obviously
like kind of
like shell shocked or something like
that but i was like man that's like a
lot of
that's a lot of emotional baggage to put
on like
75 16 year old kids
anyway hold on yeah q that's the button
five bombs baby
yeah we still took the photo
i mean they'd already warmed up the
nikon cool pics
takes half an hour to cool down
no no not not not to these guys not to
spout the spiders
did it come out well i don't know man
they went back to their hometown
afterwards i never saw it
i'm not i'm not a sentimental guy when
it comes to like photos or anything like
that okay hold on this this is where
things are gonna get
mighty interesting send it
god he's good random bombs
mommy bombs
okay you know how to fight satan it's
all about unlocks man
yeah it was it's like a curb your
enthusiasm or like a peep show bit or
something like that right like you're
not
laughing at the fact that his friend
just died or that he just got the news
but if you can't at least admit that
there's like some humor to be had in
that situation
i think you're kidding yourself
like we didn't know what we were getting
into man
good bomb good bomb
keep it rolling still going well
mix up the directions from time to time
saved
incoming deals with the devil here we go
i can't believe we're still on this man
oh the red hearts
okay so these will just kill us dead um
it's it's a long trip back to the start
it's actually that was a good teleport
we didn't get great items but the actual
room is pretty sick
do we we do not still have bombs
or we we have bombs we don't have
special bombs which takes away a lot of
the merit
buying a john merritt's remains you all
damn crazy
animal bones if i had a little damage
people come on daniel you're out here in
chat type and defeat the lamb first
look at look at this run man
[Laughter]
we we honestly did our best given the
circumstances that were available there
okay
slash marker end of
tainted eden one



we did unlock some stuff on the post-it
note we didn't get any unlocks for it
oh sorry tainted bethany but yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
mom's eyeball you need to beat the whole
dark path to get an
unlock bro that's like deflation
yeah we're tainted bethany i look i
don't know i've been streaming for two
and a half hours it's not that long
um i'll admit but like sometimes you
know the old brain
like words just spill out and they're
wrong and i just assume that like you
know what i mean
like if i can figure out what dan is
saying just from context uh clues i feel
like you should be able to say what what
i'm
or know what i'm saying say what i'm
knowing from context clues
we don't need wisps yet just chill no
wisps required
unlocks are weird for these characters
you need four ticks on the post-it note
in order to get it
we do but whoever reads your slash
marker might not i'm the one who do you
think's reading the slash markers man
they're for me we don't even call them
anything relevant
it's usually like can of corn can of
corn the streaming of isaac
repentance episode 73
so you're gonna concern troll don't do
it on my behalf
goodbye we didn't even get the tinted
rock man
slash marker mouthing
yeah don't tell the straight a student
how to take his notes or me
ball baby can of speed and i'll be all
right
okay so now i'm like what the heck do we
have to do here because we
kind of did the alt path
no we didn't do any of the alt path last
time we tried to do true path
we could try to do boss rush this time
boss rush plus anything else
boss rush plus no we did boss no we did
boss or boss rush
no we tried to do boss rush last time we
failed okay yeah yeah yeah
i got it i got it so many freaking
unlocks in this game now man
i feel like thanos i'm on my quest for
the infinity stones so i can just get
back to
farming anecdotes uh doing light path
runs over and over
yeah we're good take me down to the next
floor
boss rush hush would be an unlock so
boss rush is a good idea
okay okay we've already done hush all
right yeah yeah yeah yeah
i don't know what it is feeling like
pablo means i'm just gonna say it
is he talking about pablo escobar i
don't think i've ever heard this song
i mean i the last kanye west song i
heard was
lift yourself and and honestly like i
know that the history behind the song
but it's like it insults me that it
exists
so i like it he took like an
absolutely beautiful beat and then was
just like
guess what like i ruined it deliberately
does it go this is you know poop the
scoop of these scoopity poop
poop scoopity scoopity poopity scoop
that was on purpose yeah i know you
could it's not the talent to purposely
ruin something though
the beat was so good i mean i think i
stole this bit from cory even but the
bit
is so good or the beat is so good i
should say and then uh
he just took a dump all over it out of
like some some sense of like ego
you know if you're gonna get in a beef
with another rapper
write no vaseline or something like that
don't just be like check it out i ruined
your beat like as a joke
he's just trolling lol epic epic meme
lord
hello dude well
got you you mad you mad he ruined his
own song
lol epic owned got you okay hold on
dude i i've never been like less afraid
huge huge value
absolutely enormous value i know you're
going to say book of the dead is better
but i have to i'm chasing my losses
right now
i have to get my money back that i just
spent on this
so if you'll give me a moment please
we might be added for a bit but oh you
got to get the boss rush too that's
right
mr ryan's you know what this is only
going to take us like 90 seconds
i think it's worth it i keep using my
red hearts though that's not worth it
no skulls do you like kanye though
um i mean i was really into
uh
i shouldn't do this um on the other hand
i never had a choice
i was really into um college dropout
i was really into late registration and
then i kind of like
fell off after that
but i i mean my beautiful dark twisted
fantasy of course is a great album as
well
throw the dude you throw the dude but
that's like that's all i got
i said i i haven't listened to anything
kanye west has put out
since at least intentionally like since
2010 or something
it's been a while
still alive huh
but i don't listen to like any albums so
that's not really an indictment of kanye
west
pretty much i'm set in my ways
did you ever listen to kendrick's album
d-a-m-n
uh i think i listened to half of it
on a flight and i fell victim to like
the classic uh
bias which is like i thought i wanted to
listen to new kendrick
but what i actually wanted to do was
just hear the
the songs i already liked because it's
easier
than trying to like decipher whether or
not these ones are as good as the other
ones instead i was just like i already
know i like the other ones so i think
i'm just gonna like
i think i'm just gonna listen to those
instead
blessed penny a wealth of purity i don't
know what it does for me but
i'm interested i'm enjoying the bony
companion don't get me wrong
yeah just play the hits
soul hearts on coin pickup
i was just testing it
and it appears to not work the way i
thought it would
look i'm here to tell you like people
are asking me questions about rap music
i'm not your guy like i listen to
some hip-hop vanilla ice
uh mc hammer you know like all the good
stuff
nerd core rappers mostly um
but like all the modern stuff like like
the snoop dogs and the
the ice cubes and the easy ease and the
m.c rans and the
dj yella and stuff like that like i'm
not familiar with all that contemporary
stuff like public enemy
just don't know i i i fell out like
here's the thing i was really into rap
music when grandmaster flash was like a
hip
and then he said a hop a hip hip hop and
i said
you lost me you blew it yeah you had
your chance
let's go okay saved
good bit exactly that's hip hop
who i'm talking about y'all is hip hop
that's that's from a rapper ironically
named common
because there is nothing common about
the erudite nature of its lyrics
if anything they're quite noteworthy
la mao so i really like john wick
and john wick 2 and john wick 3. um
but have you ever seen john wick 2
because i was just thinking about it now
you remember that scene
where um common and john wick are in a
gun battle and they're walking through
like the subway
taking little sneaky shots at each other
from under
under their jackets
oh come on man
i never really thought about it until
just now but i'm like
that's come on it's a little silly right
it's a little goofy
it's all kind of goofy which is like
what i actually
part of the reason that i like it and
you can also
you can tell that uh
you know john wick has had an enormous
influence because the most recent
episode of uh
falcon in the winter soldier was just
like you know
wearing that influence on its sleeve but
that that scene in particular is kind of
hilarious
oh marvel talk here we go
here we go marvel talk here we go marvel
here we go
here we go marvel here we go i did laugh
like if you ever want to know like who
takes themselves very seriously
just go to one of those posts like i
quote tweeted it yesterday that was like
um
you know you can only remove three movie
franchises which ones do you do
everybody's like get out of the way get
out of the way i have to say marvel
cinematic universes uh
i gotta say marvel cinematic universe is
worse than avatar i gotta
say people have to know that i take
myself very easy and i'm like dude
freaking james bond is on the list
it's been around for 50 years there's
like eight good james bond movies
and you're not you're gonna like stan
james bond
i so there's a few bond movies that are
like really good
don't get me wrong but most of them are
not
and it's been around so long
like in my lifetime there's been three
good james bond movies i'm 32 years old
goldeneye casino royale and skyfall
and even skyfall i'm kind of like
gold tonight yo don't even hit me with a
question like that's bait goldeneye is
sick
goldeneye is an amazing movie it's baby
time
hello yeah you could take a shower
you put the baby in the bouncer bob had
the baby in a bouncer
she do be rattling huh you don't like it
she has bells on her socks
um i'm sure she's not gonna kick that
much it's kind of cute hey baby
and then just sorry just make sure she's
in a position where my
my broken toe can actually uh hit the
bouncer and we should be good to go
securing the baby
hello hey
yeah so i don't is broken toe is like
look i don't know if i actually broke my
toe
i can't say that with authority so don't
give me the valor
that you might think i deserve but i did
i
stubbed it like really really
really badly two weeks ago
and then like it snapped the nail off
something fierce right
and then it has like a super weird
bruise on it
that i've like i don't think i've ever
seen a bruise that looks like this it's
just like
it's not like a huge like
black and purple and yellow uh
thing it's just like a little like
crimson dot
and uh like it's still it's been two not
two months it's been two weeks
and it it hurts like a son of a gun
don't get me wrong i
can't really bend my uh my toes down i
can bend them up no problem if i bend
them down they like
they hurt a little bit but
no i've been icing it now and then it's
not so bad
but i don't want to go to the hospital
because i don't want to get the
coronavirus so
you know i'm in a little bit of a pinch
there i also i i think like
for a broken toe they just kind of tell
you to like go home right
oh take an x-ray with your phone x-ray
app
now we're talking
anyway like it's not done look i'm not
trying to flex
it's not that bad yeah we're good to go
like i i stubbed it literally like
maybe 15 minutes before a stream started
and all i'm gonna say is that nobody in
chat was like hey
you're like talking a little frantic
today is it possible that you broke your
toe before the stream started
bless you
if it's broken they can set it properly
that's fine i'll just have like a weird
toe
i would go in to get it set properly if
they would give me my vaccine as like a
two for one deal but i don't think they
will
unfortunately so as a result i think um
i mean really it's the hospital's loss
i'm not gonna show you my feet
unless you're giving me that johnson and
johnson
plus i already got the like scar tissue
in my knee from the torn meniscus so
like
my legs already hurt when it rains like
how much worse could it be
look when you live a high impact
lifestyle like me you just accept that
injuries are part of the game
torn minkus you know what
i i do hate these enemies why don't we
just do one of these
whoa
just received my hoodie and there were
35 canadian
import charges on it thanks look okay
that does
suck but it also
isn't my fault that's one we we gotta
we gotta take that up with the canadian
government man
they're getting me on everything too
like they're i don't know i didn't
realize like we we we sold out our our
vaccine uh
production facilities in like 1993 for
20 bucks and like a tim hortons gift
card
but the canadian t-shirt industries are
like they're like we must protect them
at all costs
but i i do i mean that sucks i apologize
just know that like you know you and me
were on the same page on this one
in in my life i have probably spent
i'm gonna say like between 500 and 700
on import charges for things that
publishers have sent us in the mail that
i never even asked for
yo rafi roo
thank you for the the gifted
subscriptions thank you
is there someone we could talk to about
this could we like uh
talk to justin trudeau and be like hey
man can we like chill out on the import
fees
for t-shirts like we're just trying to
we're just trying to operate a business
here
it actually now that i'm thinking about
it too i'm like it is kind of messed up
because i'm like
the money is going to a canadian company
the shirts just happen to be printed in
america
i'm not trying to laugh at the at the
negativity here i'm just saying i'm like
it's like quintuple taxation
next time we'll just send them all to
justin and then he can address them as
gifts
i agree that does blow though i
apologize
does this even work not at all
yeah it's like the it's the irony of the
situation that's humorous not the
situation itself
ah frog
likes to hop pop hop
he jumps in the water
splish splash
i don't know if you can hear the baby
she's going ah
he's not making boss rush oh crap
okay you're absolutely right i don't i
mean
at this point i accept
that you could not be more correct
why am i using this item like this man
come on
oh i thought this was the one this is so
like when i said does it work
someone was like it's clearly working
low i actually thought these are the
ones
that i took offense by the way i took
that personal you you've been added to
the chat ledger
i thought this is the one where the
shots had to hit each other in the air
to create like that one
super shot that does uh extra damage
like the the accretive shots or whatever
it's called
this is one where it's like booger tears
but but it also
grows i understand okay
oh dude absolutely okay we got
30 seconds to make it to the boss rush
it's not
impossible we just need to blow you up
and you're gonna give me a card okay
you're gonna give me an emperor card
right here that's the only way through
super magnet
or mama mega we can get mama mega in the
shop can of corn
dude i don't know so cracked crown is
like it's pretty good but blessed
penny's been doing some great work for
us as well
hey baby
if we don't make it that's fine we could
just do i mean i guess we could do
lightroom path just to maximize the
number of unlocks we could get
surely cracked crown is better
you best be careful you're still on chat
probation okay
i know you're probably like he
remembered my name yesterday and a week
ago
but surely he's forgotten it by now
common misconception that's locked up
there forever
excuse me i thought you were dead
ice cold it's not ice cold i'm not
saying
like hey you know hey
i'm i'm just saying i got my eye on you
you're a known entity
it's not a threat it's just like hey you
know
it's like when someone's on probation
you know they get a speeding ticket they
get put in prison for life it's called
the criminal justice system
succubus you're doing great work
i was dude like i might even pitch this
to twitch i think it's so
unnecessary but it would also be a lot
of fun um
what if when you did on band requests
you could put people on
like probation
like what if you would be on
here's my thought okay with an
unban request you could either give
somebody
a full pardon you could unban them
completely or you could give them
one week probation and probation is just
like you can only type one message
every uh 60 seconds
which is probably like more
than most people chat to begin with
but i still like for some
like yeah personal slow mode exactly
or i i also do think a badge is a great
idea
like a badge that's like this person was
unbanned recently
and they couldn't choose whether or not
to display it
yeah and they have to report to when
they're on chat probation they have to
report to a mod at the end of every
stream
and and go over all of their chat
messages and explain themselves
could be fun right could could be a lot
of fun
poor mods ah you know
nevertheless
it would be very funny for me though
i mean i hate to say it we could just do
the alt path are we realistically gonna
live
probably not
i don't think so
nl are you a tech fascist um
i don't think so no not really
i don't know what that means
i'm one of those people that's like i
think if i don't know
what like the the political system
you're describing is
it doesn't i don't identify with it i
think they've come up with worm
with words for most of my political
beliefs
yo diplo is pretty good like some i
i don't know if i was accused or
suggested of being an anarcho
anarcho capitalist sorry anarcho
communist on my own subreddit
and then somebody said that's based and
i was like i don't know what that
means man i
i like i can't take either praise or
offense to it
until you explain to me like what that
is
not based based based in grill pills
isn't that the opposite of based d based
i don't know man
well it's just like i and we're getting
into like
maybe it's a little too close to home
for some people
but like you know somebody made a post
on the subreddit that was like what are
nl's political beliefs and then somebody
was like he doesn't get into it that
much and then
they wrote like it's sad i you'd think
someone as smart as him would want to
live in the real world
and then i just of course i went through
their reddit post history and it's all
on gotcha
mobile games but you know
the good news is it was downvoted to
oblivion before i saw it anyway
okay just give me a sec we're still
farming up a little bit here
it's not a it's not a bit at gentian
impacts
expense okay
but it is a bit that takes it pokes some
fun at it
but isn't gentian at uh it's a good time
for it right
because of the fact that uh aren't
people boycotting gentian impact now
do i not find myself on the right side
of history yet again
i saw on twitter hashtag boycott gentian
apparently i'm just gonna keep walking
into this room over and over i think i
think i'm gonna take the five room
let's let's get insane here
they wanna boycott it because it's
nefariously monetized
that's what i've been trying to tell you
man
that's what i've been saying
that's not why oh okay never mind
hey
that's not why at all i don't know i
don't read the i only read the headlines
right life's too short
tubbo imprisoned on dream smp tells me
everything i need to know
based yeah man exactly
a card can a can of card and i'll be all
right
i've lost control of this run
like i don't know where i am
ever since i took 4.5 volt i'm like i
don't know what i'm doing
i feel like there was about
10 rooms in a row where i didn't do any
combat
but we can get back in here for sure
now twitter's been pretty good lately
like i tweeted that thing about eating
goldfish for breakfast today
and uh it's a new item and then somebody
was like
you know this argument would have worked
a lot better if it was for bagels
instead of for uh cheerios or instead of
for goldfish i don't really know i
didn't read it that closely and i just
went you know what
muted why shouldn't i why shouldn't i
have it i don't even i don't think they
meant any
offense at all but i didn't know who
they were and the comments sort of
annoyed me
so i'm trying out a new thing which is
everybody gets one strike
and you might say what happens when you
follow that to its logical conclusion
and no
you don't get any tweets i think that's
the dream maybe i think that might be
the
the end goal that you're kind of looking
for
here comes twitter cord dude that's a
good idea
good ending twitter yeah it's the dog
ending from silent hill
yeah we'll get that new item just just
relax just chill we gotta get some
semblance of like
uh like purpose on this run like i still
don't really know what i'm doing
anytime a run goes this long i start to
get twisted up a little bit
i'm sorry i annoyed you with my spatial
awareness for dummies tweet when you
were playing
kerbal space program
i hope i'm not muted if i so what i'm
guessing is
there's a chance you tweeted me
uh like a picture of uh for dummies book
that said
spatial awareness for dummies and said
hey i've been watching your kerbal space
program episodes it seems like you could
use this
your apology is accepted but your
punishment is unchanged
i respect your contrition um
and i believe it is genuine but you will
not be unmuted you had your chance
it's not like it's a major punishment i
don't see your tweets
big whoop you know it's not quite a
black mirror episode
might be a stark realization if you've
tweeted me like you know
a hundred times in the past few years
and then you start adding up in your
head oh my god it's like hours of my
life that
i just threw away for nothing but like
you know as long as you don't think
about it in that sense and and let that
like creep in
and you got nothing to worry about
how do i know if uh you see my tweets
that's the thing man that's the thing
you never know yeah that's true it
if you tweet me uh during my uh
oh why did i do that just to get a full
card if you tweet me during my off hours
and sometimes i click the heart on it
then you're safe if not you're living in
uncertainty
yeah or i'll recycle your joke for use
in a later isaac episode it's that
simple
but then like i will say the other thing
about being muted is that it's actually
not like as much of a punishment as it
seems
because it doesn't just mute
it actually like it
it puts like a little box i don't know
if you've ever muted somebody on twitter
and then have
had them reply it gives you a little box
that's like hey this tweet is from
somebody you've muted
would you like to see it and then
there's a freaking sexy button
that's like yes there's like a little
like
like sadness loot box
where you really should be like i'm not
gonna
like click on this but then i click on
it anyway and it says like you know
you know lol egg lull forehead lull egg
sad egg green hat egg and then i'm like
why did i even click on that man
marbles fantastic okay so i gotta tell
you
i think we should take the alt path okay
can i tell you why
it's very simple we have
57 red hearts stored up
i feel like we could make the run strong
enough
no don't do it all right i'm not gonna
do it
do it all right i i sucked up the
trinket dude that's incredible that the
marbles were so good
i'm gonna do it what do you think do it
don't do it do it
don't do it okay i'm not gonna do it do
it all right i'm gonna do it um
give me invincibility
i gotta use my space bar item at some
point though dude
okay give me this lord of the pit
yeah yeah i'm gonna do it we sucked up
an amazing trinket
dude i'm gonna be honest i know you're
looking at this and you're like the
man's just straight up lost his mind
wrong we're gonna get so many spirit
hearts
thanks to swallowing that that trinket
that i think we're we're in the clear
man
do it just do it
it's an ice bucket challenge it's an ice
bucket challenge you know what i'm
saying
yeah any venue fans out there
nope all right it's an ice bucket
challenge it's
no all right he sings it's my life do
whatever i want to do
i am a very good bad boy i forgot the
baby was here for like this whole
episode
baby i guess what i'm trying to say like
is don't use social media like
i was talking to dan about it and not in
like a spiraling
sort of way but i was like i really
don't see like
like i don't understand the future of
facebook or like the future of twitter
like if you're my age or younger like
don't you look at those
like social media as like something that
has made the world a little bit worse
that's kind of the way i'm starting to
look at it
so then i'm like well like how does
social media sir if that thesis proves
true
how does social media like stay alive in
the future and i'm like well i guess
like maybe
like i guess like i mean it's selfish
right but like
you know these these are apps not jobs
right like you they should serve you
instead of the other way around but like
i was thinking like my my dream like
social media platform is just a place
where i can
like leave little micro blogs and nobody
can reply to me
which i guess twitter is kind of getting
to right like you can
you can set your tweets as being like
only repliable
to by people who follow you but like
whenever i see someone do that i'm like
you're a coward but then i'm also like i
think i should
like do i think my life on twitter would
be better if i did that
oh you're welcome
hmm
dunk oh i can stop balancing okay
yeah man i just want to grill that's
what i'm saying
oh she she was smiling she was happy she
made like no noise at all
she was having a great time yeah thank
you baby i'll see you later this
afternoon
i know like i apologize because like
we're like i've talked about social
media too much but like i have been
thinking about it
like what here's how i described it to
dan because i said i
i said point blank to him that i think
facebook has made the world a worse
place
and and i count twitter in that as well
i don't consider like twitter
um to be superior it in well
i think it's better but like it's it's
bad in the same way
and he was like why do you think that
and i was like because i i think that
like
i underes estimated like how much of a
mental drain it is
to have unfettered access to the
thoughts of ten percent of the dumbest
or the the bottom ten percent of
intelligent people on planet earth
whatever they're thinking at any given
moment right
like you just constantly i'm not even
worried about like uh
you know oh like instagram reality where
people are like photoshopping their
butts or something like that like that
doesn't
it could be a problem but it doesn't
really bother me specifically
instead it's just the constant brain rot
from like
an endless font of the dumbest people
you've never met
talking about things they don't
understand over and over
like that's the that's the thing that
gets me
and some of those people by the way
probably think i'm the dumbest person
they've never met for the record but
i mean only one of us can be right
and we'll just leave it at that
i mean so someone said you should pay
attention to the run you're spiraling a
little bit
it's like just a situation where like i
wanna not spiral
but it's tough because i also want to
see
what's happening in a room and
unfortunately that's not possible right
now
but i actually think as long because we
got an item room in a shop
i think we can pull ourselves out of
this
why is your map so big thanks i get that
a lot
um but anyway yeah there's social media
or as i have grown to refer to it no
thanks media
so what media is it yeah social media
or as i like to call it so what media
have you heard what people are saying oh
the bread on my sandwich is too hard get
over it get a job
come join the rest of society the
water's fine
i'm telling you man people these days
they're crazy
i was at the mall the other day and this
girl was like
people are being mean to me on social
media i said well you know what i call
it
so what media people got a problem with
you
so what sorry sorry um
i got we've already been to our item
room okay hold on
oh check this out man check this out
i thought that was a good bit
free bomb
and i'm skipping the dishes yeah but i'm
taking the garbage out
i'm taking the garbage out
10 times a day it was a good thank you i
i'd love to hear it it was a good bit
thank you
thank you appreciate that
now i must be more cautious
although i would love to take this i
think that
we're unlikely to maintain the hp base
required
what how long have we been on this run
oh my god
oh my lord occur
it's cardi b right
reverse spiral yeah yeah yeah
i always pull myself out of the spiral i
don't know like i feel like uh
i feel like and this is honest built
different i feel like i'm a little
different than the average person like i
always feel
and you ever hear something called like
an internal locus of control
i feel when it comes to my unhappiness i
have an internal locus of control
so things that i'm unhappy with i feel
empowered
uh to actually
change them you know i feel like for
most things
i have the ability to influence like my
own uh
my own enjoyment of life in that sense
so whenever i'm complaining and people
are like are you okay i'm like
yeah i'm just like i'm i'm
self-diagnosing more than like spiraling
like if social media doesn't make you
happy then you
then you bounce by the way hold on
how am i gonna get the red key
you don't need it
because you're already an alt character
yeah yeah yeah you're absolutely right
but then what am i doing
i thought i was gonna take the light
path on this run
all of a sudden i'm you beating the boss
okay
oh yeah cause i was like i'm not gonna
do it i'm gonna do it i'm not gonna do
it i'm gonna do it and then i did it
okay that's right that's right
now i remember now i recall can of corn
baby internal locus to control can of
corn
i said you gotta admit like it's a hard
game to keep tabs on you know there's a
lot of things going on
use the book i will not use the hold on
hold on
hold on am i not charging
lemmington unless it's actually like in
the active spot here
yeah it had to be in the active spot
that whole time oh no
i'm calling it lemmington it just did
like
out of the corner of my eye that's what
it looks like
let me get one let me get a
yo ox don't do it don't don't do the
whole thing
bacon egg and cheese salt and pepper
ketchup
may want to roll yes sir yes
okay okay that's spiraling that's
spiraling
64 red hearts may as well use them see
that is what
an intermediate level isaac player
would suggest as an advanced
uh theta
level 74 isaac player
i know that the proper way to use them
is to
generate wisps on the static fight
the lacroix fight
and to lump them all in
lemmington won't charge unless you lose
book of the dead
bro but why when you say lose do you
mean replace with another space bar item
or do you mean just like
have it disappear it seems like it's
charging slowly yeah you know what
i bet i bet some idiots set these up in
parallel instead of in series
that's the problem
i i am very smart i know a lot about
electricals
did your dad ever do the um the thing
where when he was like fixing something
electrical or like you know
going to the fuse box or something like
that to replace a fuse
he would like stick his arms into the
fuse box and then go like
so my my dad didn't
but i've seen a few videos like it is
it is kind of hilarious i gotta admit
also like terrible because you you
basically
if you really the the prank is that
you're making your kid think that
their dad died which is pretty messed up
but it is also kind of funny
like in a second you're like like once
you get over the fact that
like you know you thought you were gonna
be like an orphan
then you start to really see the humor i
would say
and that's why you always wear
electrical resistant gloves
dude my grandpa was a real prankster
i should do it tomorrow on stream that'd
be sick my grandpa was a real prankster
like
you'd be driving along with him at like
not highways
we lived in the country so there wasn't
a lot of traffic but you'd be driving
along like 30 or 40 kilometers an hour
and he would just slam on the brakes
as hard as he could and you'd be like
what the hell happened and he was like
oh i was just testing to see if the
brakes work
you're like it just it really got the
adrenaline going
can you be killed no okay
yeah he also pranked me with his uh bald
gene
thanks a lot
we do a little trolling
is granddad powers
yes sir
my father had great hair i'm 24 and bald
as heck
so like i i'm wary of the fact that i'm
becoming like a
correlation equals causation that's not
really what i mean
i'm i'm wary of the idea that like maybe
it's confirmation bias i guess but
um i've always heard that it's
your mom's dad that passes on the
baldness
uh and i would say in my own case that's
it bears out my grandfather balded young
and and as did i
i don't know how you know you know
whether that data bears out over a large
sample size
oh it won't charge until book of the
dead is fully charged so we should just
have book of the dead like fully charged
but it's like way too late
it's fine though okay okay okay yeah
yeah yeah
where do you find things like yeah baby
steak and yes sir and ooh
papa literally a hundred percent of them
are stolen from chibley
it's like i'm not gonna pretend right
like
yes sir ooh and
steak baby are are all chib originals
by which i mean he didn't make them but
he did find them
where does he find them i don't know
chibs chips twitter is an interesting
place
like i don't know how he finds all this
stuff
like he knows let me rephrase people on
twitter seem to know chibley
like sometimes chibly will like quote
tweet a tweet that he was not
actually added in where someone's like
wow this has like chib energy or
something and i'm and then i
check and i'm like does that person
follow me and they don't
and i'm like chib's like he's he's like
a twitter
star
no idea what that is
so what's the name of this boss oh they
haven't
they haven't come up with it yet they're
still working on that
got him yes sir oh that could be good
that could be good
yes sir you can only have six wisps at a
time right so i'm not trying to like
blow up my spot here on wisps
what the heck
okay you should have should have gotten
out of the way of that one
you can have 24 what the heck am i doing
dude
i'm trying not to use um
the book of the dead simply because i
think we'll charge
faster on lamington
if we oh dr fetus baby dr fetus dr fetus
and we got all these bomb synergies this
is sick dude
that's an easy win
what talking head song is this
this is at the end of um cross item
painless when he's like the facts are
crazy and effective
the facts are on time the facts aren't
late i know
i know what you're talking about i'm
picking it up
a little low-key baby okay we got an
issue with the
with the doctor fetus bombs it's very
hard to hit you
when we get the chance though i mean
look at that
golden bomb
we got tears we got tears yes yes yes
sir serpents kiss
yes sir mini mush yes sir
ghost pepper i don't know what our luck
stat is but
oh no dude you can't lose your wisps
like this like
because we've only got i think two
charges of lemmington left
succubus is doing great work though i'm
not spamming let me get on because we're
gonna lose our wisps in like bullet
heck and then we're not gonna have any
wisps left when things get a little
tougher
come on man like you're dead
we got to get those ghost peppers in
there there we go
oh yeah dude imagine how good book of
the dead will be after we press the
space bar finally
that not smart
also very dumb
distant admiration not what i'm looking
for i would get this is like a 50 50
right now
i'm feeling pretty good i also have
never taken damage on the cuphead
section
i'm thinking this is about 50 50 though
that's good x placebo good spores
great damage
get yourself a little safety little
lamington yo epiphora i'm doing a lot of
shooting in the same direction here
what's that what are you doing you're
charging something up
yo lemmington is actually like a sick
item
you got no head anymore you got no
respect
for the silence that serves
as the foundation of creativity
all right i think he's toasted like are
you seeing this damage
i'm kind of surprised he's lived this
long
we have lost a few wisps but that's okay
because we're charging up some good
lamingtons
what the no no
no
cupid's arrow what the i thought you
died
brimstone is that a brimstone shot what
are you doing there

all right slash marker
next run



had some good runs some bad runs and and
some runs where we honestly had no idea
just to be straight up with you what we
were doing at all
i think the time has come to try to get
anything but mom's heart unlocked no you
know what screw this
new tainted character just dropped okay

right this is normal kane yeah
is i don't have tainted kane uh unlocked
sweaty
mr mister that's i was gonna say
culture club
i knew it was it had some form of
alliteration i didn't mean it was just a
straight up copy
when will youtube catch up to this stuff
um
there is i mean there's a little bit of
a backlog right now but i'm publishing
like
minimum two and a half often times three
hours of isaac daily
uh so it should only be like maybe
three days or something like that like
there's a lot of
there's a lot of isaac coming down the
pipeline
no question there
yo you know kate was uh telling me
yesterday we we talked about how like
the youtube algorithm sometimes blesses
a video
so far after its release like it
happened with kukiomi and then
uh chat was like hey is your backs uh
not backstabber um
leg breaker video is your leg breaker
video doing well it's been recommended
to me a lot and then we found out that
like uh
you know it's got plus 80 000 views in
like the last week which is insane
uh kate was showing me like her youtube
recommended
it was like 30 of my videos
[Laughter]
i have no idea what what caused me to be
positive in the youtube algorithm lately
but i mean obviously she's getting
more because she probably watches my
stuff to begin with but
i don't know what happened man youtube
likes you lately
you know what it is is that every time
they change the algorithm there's a
chance that it it hits on the one metric
that i crush
everybody on and i know how that that
sounds egotistical
but like it's not that my content is
better or worse or
particularly juicy or whatever is is
that the watch time
anytime i've ever talked to someone
about youtube analytics
the average watch time of the channel
is just absurd and the reason it's
absurd
is because the videos are too long and
for
years that's been an extreme negative
yeah we should be using the active
you're not wrong
but if they make watch time every time
they move watch time
up in the like importance factor it it
benefits me
now who's laughing
now who's laughing
okay we're out of here never got the
tinted rock don't want to go alt path
don't want to go all path because we're
hold on i'm running
through my brain all the things they say
running through my brain running through
my brain
drop the trinket in here thank you chad
i appreciate it
and then just go straight down yeah yeah
and now have you seen the abomination
that is
coca-cola and coffee i'll do you one
better have you seen the abomination
that's
sunny d and rum yum yum think i'll go
and get me some
ooh sunny d and rum yum yum
i'm actually i'm kind of into the
coca-cola coffee
i don't want to get like you know to
review bra
about it but uh sure why not i'm not
scared
i i kind of like the bitterness of the
coffee
is cut by the sweetness of the of the
coca-cola like
i kind of like it
it tastes like pepperoni i don't know
about that
i don't know about all that pepperoni
slander
what about coffee beers i'm for him
i'm forum
two bit it is a double dose of
bitterness but like
i'm not gonna be like insane i'm not
gonna lie to you and say that bitterness
is my favorite flavor
but i guess it's not you know what i
mean my favorite taste
spectrum of flavor but i i like
bitterness
i like a stout or an ipa i like coffee
medicine paint
all that stuff dude all that stuff
black licorice poison all all the stuff
in that kind of
in that grouping wanna swig
have you been drinking pain again i
can't make this happen but how sick
would it be if i went no and then i
stuck out my tongue and it was like
beige
that would be an amazing commitment to a
bit
i wish i had in the bathroom i wish i
had rehearsed this and and gotten it
you know so we could do it
the final bit
[Laughter]
oh there was probably yeah it was not
worth it
the forbidden bit
show your toe no because chad's just
gonna tell me to go to the hospital and
i don't want to get
covered i don't know why everyone's like
go to the hospital and get covered just
so they can tell you yeah your toes
broken dummy
send it just get vaccinated i'm freaking
trying okay
okay i gotta be honest it's a little
spicy
but i'm going to do it anyway
and then we will go to the shop
i was i'm stoked though i mentioned it
yesterday my parents finally i don't why
why am i awarding this like it's the
start of a stand-up routine
you know my parents got vaccinated
yesterday and then the audience goes
like
thank you thank you and now i gotta tell
you their internet reception is off the
charts
four bars everywhere
but seriously though
we're moving on
i can't wait to rub it in though man
they got that astrazeneca
in six months when the johnson and
johnsons get released for
30 somethings i'm gonna be flexing i'm
gonna be flexing
my dealer's gonna give me some of that
good stuff
hey yo man what kind of vaccine strain
you looking for
i'm looking for like a heady high
i know look i would i would choose
whatever they wanted to give me
but if i had a choice
i don't know probably the the johnson
and johnson one because it's only one
dose right
all other things being equal i'd rather
be a one doe smartie
i mean why would you know you'd rather
only have to get the jab one time than
two times i guess
vaccine manufacturer tier list when i'm
telling you so like i know i've talked
about this
a couple of times on various like you
know platforms or whatever
but i come mighty close to like
you know tweeting pfizer moderna etc etc
and
just saying something like hey uh
release the recipe
2021 challenge i don't know like i'm
worried that they would actually have
some connections to twitter and be like
you know 24-hour band permanent but
plus it cheeses me off because i'm a
pfizer shareholder
like shouldn't i get early access to the
vaccine
it'll bring it up at the next uh
annual general meeting
you're a class b shareholder i don't
know if wait that's probably true
i didn't know they had uh they had
preferred shares my mistake
what a way to go though yeah yeah yeah
exactly
it's pronounced puffizer nope
not true nice try next
that might work on some streamers but
not on me
all right six cards this is not this is
not how you want to use diplopia okay
here's how you want to use diplopia you
buy it
it's actually pronounced p fister
come on chad i need some better jokes to
steal
just a lot of people talking about
medicine right now for some reason
can't imagine why
that was me i'm sorry
i have a sad story by the way if you've
been following the airfryer uh sequence
you know it's a bad story
because like normally i talk about the
air fryer stuff right away
but uh boy
look at this now we're rolling look at
that range upgrade and the shot speed
baby
um but uh
i want i was talking about how we had
this shrimp pesto pizza to cook from
hellofresh
um but i so i was gonna cook it in the
airfryer was so excited to have air
fryer pizza
but then like the flatbread they gave us
was
at least three times larger than the
than the size of the airfryer basket
so i had to cook that stuff in the oven
like a
like a peasant
sad so i had to cook it in a big
iron cauldron over a fledgling open
flame
i was like what if i felt like i was
alive in like the victorian era i was
using like a pot belly stove
everybody from the town came and and
brought the vegetable that they grew
at their hometown farm and they all
threw it in and then i was like i just
threw in like a little rock
and then they said what do we call it
and i was like stone soup
[Laughter]
and they were like it's good i was like
i know
it's pretty sick basically i
own them
sea salt is popping off on youtube
really dude hold on
kay was telling me the basement
collection's popping off on youtube hold
on
okay this again is one of my favorite
segments analytics deep dive
because i don't watch my own youtube
videos so i never know what gets
recommended to people
sea salt pikmin meets hp lovecraft sea

week
after getting 2 000 views in a year
that's that's cool kate told me the
basement collection was pogging as well
the basement collection video is so old
it doesn't even have like the analytics
built in
[Laughter]
it's from 2012.
i opened up the analytics it's all it's
all just triangles
it's like caution caution this might not
be like accurate okay fair enough
all right i don't know man like all
those it's funny
all those northern lion tries that i
made last year
for this exact purpose are actually
paying off but like a year later than i
thought
that they would
oh yeah that's the other thing i'm gonna
check one more i apologize if you're
watching this on youtube but this is
dynamic twitch content and what
there's not enough isaac for you um kate

appreciate the heads up because like i
have no idea like
again i never see this stuff
the only time i really like uh
notice how well or poorly i'm doing on
youtube and this is this is honest but
like
is when i get paid and like there's some
months where i'm like well i don't know
why
that number is high and then there's
some months where i'm like what the heck
i've been busting my butt
and it's like why is the number so low
yera ansus it's it's a weird business
yerriera on the wall

please i'm begging you stop saying effin
steak baby

anymore
recently your top 10 sexiest isaac
characters video got recommended to me
you must have me confused with indy
mouse
i don't do a bait like that
i don't do horny bait i exclusively talk
about boring things like
the efficient market theory and the
capital asset pricing model
until my audience begs me to stop
it's a system i can't understand why but
it's just worked for me for as long as i
can recall
and air fryers yes sir um
so i'm not taking blood rights i'll tell
you that much
so i'm not taking anything
sorry i forgot to take pills too yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
i have to tell you i go to business
school
and the uh oh that was cool by the way
do you see that uh
experimental pill only has positives
when you're
when you're cane i thought it would
still have a negative but someone said i
gotta tell you i go to
finance school and all the finance talk
has got me pogged
that's why i do it it's for all the
little uh
arbitrage maniacs out there
and that people keep it you know they
and now stop i'm gonna beat you up i'm
gonna take your lunch money if you talk
about
uh you know beta anymore and i'm like
you can't stop me
i'm doing it for the love of the game
man
people have got to know about the five
factors that account for the pricing
differences in stocks and efficient
capital markets
and they're like i hate you and i'm like
all right no
i've seen your tweets
i don't know man finance guys or freaks
wait what do you mean though you mean
like like you know we're the freaks of
the industry
if as if you see me backstage be
prepared the g
you know that song by the way hold on
freaks
of the industry it's by digital
underground
my my manager publicist and and
personal friend uh david miyazaki
anytime i'm around him he's always like
check this song out
okay so it's a song that live narrates
um
um uh intercourse right
i don't know i shouldn't even read this
stuff but uh there's
some of it gets me so good
like okay i i'm just like
if you look at the lyrics they're
literally like a thousand words long
okay here it is um you're lying on your
back
with your head on the edge of the bed
the booty's two feet from your head
should you a take the time to find a
prophylactic b you walk right over
and you pound them c
tell her that you want your love well
the answer is d
all of the above so you're freaking
the furniture squeaking she's tweaking
saying that she's weak in the knees
cheek to cheek and pound for pound
you're taxing it and waxing it and
working it around
till the booty starts making that
clapping sound
which is cool but your friends are
chilling in the other room
the clapping's getting louder you don't
want them to clown you
in this situation what do you do a
you plain and simply back up off her b
you hit it just a little bit softer
okay i'm not gonna say what c is but
d is what i do so yo listen up i put a
towel on the floor by the two
inch gap under the door now they can't
hear me anymore
anyway i would highly recommend it
you ever have that situation where
you're
you're tweaking and freaking and waxing
it around
but then the booty starts making that
clapping sound and you're worried that
your friends in the other room are gonna
laugh at you for having such wacky
sounding intercourse
well it's very simple all you do is you
get that towel by the door and shove it
in the two-inch gap
it's that simple hello dan
dan you were a little overtime today huh
how was uh how was the eddy
ed and eddie
you picked a great time for the raid by
the way
because i mean quite frankly you just
missed some extremely little brother
uh uh commentary
possibly the most little brother
commentary i've ever done
at least in 2021 but i didn't invent it
that's it's just from a song
man
can't be little brother if it's from a
song yeah that's what i was thinking man
it's like for one
you know what kind of house does this
guy live in
where he's got a two-inch gap under his
bedroom door
like that seems too large
and that how big is two inches it's like
it's like that that's that's crazy you
could like crawl under that thing man
don't even get i was thinking about the
blade review the other day if you
if you're not familiar okay so there's
this website called
ain't it cool news i'm not gonna read it
it's so bad
but like so this movie you know blade
about the vampire hunter stars wesley
snipes came
out later um blade two came out and
ain't it cool news and their flagship
reviewer
harry knowles got uh to watch it at the
premiere i think
and the language he uses to describe
blade 2 is just so
laden with unnecessarily specific
horny imagery about how like you know
is that and then guillermo starts
working his
tongue on your you know what getting you
like
so close to the edge you're about to
burst and then he says no
not yet and then the club scene and then
you're like what are you doing
it's blade too man it's not like
like the whole movie is like his fever
dream about getting eaten out by
guillermo del toro
he does say he backs off like 10 times
he gets the audience right to the edge
and then he backs off
it's terrible man
it's like people are getting like their
heads exploded in the movie and stuff
like that i'm sure but
nothing in the movie will ever be as
offensive as the review
please don't do not mods don't ban them
but
do not post the text from the review in
chat i hate it
this is isaac after dark despite it
being bright outside but uh
justin was also telling me he was like
he really likes
kevin smith except kevin smith has like
one tweet
that like drives him insane with how bad
it is
and then i had to google and like it's
so easy right i just googled kevin smith
terrible tweet and then it's like a
tweet from 2011 or something that was
like
can't believe i've been married to this
hot piece of
a word for 10 years heard her
pink her brown and her taint still pee
own my dick
and i'm like it's so
tate that's paint and brown area yeah
it's like it's so bad man
it's like why would you come on why
would you even
think that in those words
but then also like
write it and then after writing it be
like yeah this needs to be sent
but then also there's like a secondary
layer where he was like
um hey just so you know like we were
just having a laugh like my wife won a
bet to make me tweet
the worst thing we could possibly come
up with
and then i i don't believe it
and i'll tell you why i don't believe it
is because that sounds like something he
would write
for his movies you know like i've i
watched mall rats recently
and i'm like that sounds like something
out of my rats
you're telling me you couldn't see that
you couldn't see jason muse being like
her taint in her brown area
do the schmovie movie am i you know what
i could tell like it just it sounds like
kevin smith so what i think happened
is that he thought it would be funny and
made the tweet and then people were like
gross and he was like oh yeah it was a
bit and i'm like yo
david hello
plus he did write a glowing review
of star wars episode 1 as an adult
which just calls all of his future
judgment into question
i heard the freaks of the industry bit
you know you know what it is
uh good artists boro great artist steel
i i heard it from uh from a friend of
mine
i just like it's just a horrible tweet
though man like it's
it's insanely bad
i'm 37 and i love episode one all right
look you're
you're you're a civilian you're not held
to the same standard as kevin smith okay
kevin smith works
in in film
this is like a doctor being like i'm a
doctor and i think smoking is good for
you right
like if you're like a roofer and you're
like i think smoking's good for you
like i mean obviously i disagree but at
least you don't work in the business
right
i'm saying i disagree
fool card yeah yeah can of corn can it
can can a bubble and i'll be all right
tell me where the tinted skull is
take pills you know it's a good point
that's a good point
yeah jason muse i know he streams on
twitch now because i saw him stream with
uh
apollo room before room before boss okay
thank you
um and i was like i wonder if apollo has
told him that he hasn't
uh ever seen a movie not like just
any of his movies but any movies in
general
i wonder
pills okay okay room before the room
before the boss tinted skull
it hasn't come up fair enough
he wouldn't believe it you haven't seen
any smoothie movies my duty
you got to fill that blu-ray slot with
the dvd my man
i don't know i haven't seen enough to
to do an ad hoc on the fly impression
my brain is like so fried i'm like what
am i doing and they're like oh just pick
up any item
like literally it doesn't matter you're
going to steamroll the rest of the run
and then we're going to do a beautiful
run as tinted cane
i'm sorry i don't i don't mean to be
rude to
jason muse is it the
the view is skewed universe the
universe as as uh ask universe
it's never really appealed to me i saw
clerks too
and i was like that's kind of funny
and then i saw clerks one and i was like
that's pretty
good and then every other kevin smith
movie i've ever seen
oh no that's not true when i saw a dogma
i was like that's pretty good
but every other kevin smith movie
i've been like ah
i'm not worried about yera i think full
health is more valuable here
that's true i did hear chasing amy was
good too
i've seen red state i wasn't impressed i
saw maul rats it basically turned me
into tip or gore
i was like this movie shouldn't exist uh
jay and silent bob strike back i i mean
i don't know
nobody's gonna be happy with what i'm
about to say like i
i i saw when i was like 12 and i was
like this movie's too juvenile for me
if you like it you like it i'm not
trying to like you know police your
your fun i'm just like
i will say though if you gave me the
choice between
the average adam sandler movie
between
let me just see what this is ancient
recall
between 2008 and 2020
and any kevin smith movie i would
definitely watch
the kevin smith movie 100.
help i'm come on come on man how you
supposed to dodge that
did you dan did you ask ed did you ask
him
i have one specific question it's how
are you supposed to dodge that
it hurts no it doesn't
all right agree to disagree
would you rather watch 2001 a space
odyssey or a kevin smith movie
i would rather watch only 2001 a space
odyssey for sure
but we we it's my psychological problems
are well known
i take my myself too seriously and i
don't have the intellect to back it up
it leaves me in this awkward position
where i'm like i'm too smart for this
movie and then i try to watch like a
you know a smart movie and i'm like this
is boring
you know that's why i just end up
watching austin powers over and over
again
did it
great stuff gold member or an adam
sandler movie
i would rather watch an adam sandler
movie i've never seen than gold member
again
gold member is is offensively unfunny
i think i can't believe that gold member
is not considered
it's look it's not as bad as the love
guru
but i am a little surprised that gold
member most people are like uh it's kind
of funny
when gold member is genuinely
just a notch above the love guru
the love guru is is truly like an
affront to
i mean just about anything you could
think of filmmaking
comedy all of mike myers earlier work
it's like it's offensive and also not
funny at all
so you're like well why are what was the
point of all the offense
it's it's horrible
something is wrong with me because i
really like the love guru
did you like the part where um one of
the hockey players hits vern troyer with
a hockey stick
and then he slides down the ice and ends
up going into the net
and then the goal horn goes off
yes i did okay well then you know what
fair enough
funniest thing i ever saw
[Laughter]
honestly that's my favorite part okay
fair enough
i love the look of it the smell of it
unfortunately i lost my wedding tackle
in an unfortunate smelting accident
how are you so good at this game it's
honestly like the nicest thing anyone
said in here all day
look at that you can't pull that jimmy
fallon ascii stuff here
you see that wasn't even auto mod that
origin got that in like
that was so fast oh my god
i actually i didn't think that that was
uh
i thought that was algorithmic
it was like pre-typed or something
that's good that's crazy
oh okay nightbot got it and then you you
hit him with the band
okay fair enough still though he's that
mods are on x games mode dude
i haven't seen don't mess with the zohan
but i will cop to something uh
i i saw the trailer
for don't mess with the zohan i think it
aired in front of iron man in theaters
and i laughed at the trailer so that's
that's as much as i'm willing to cop to
i was 20 years old at the time so it was
like
it was a while ago but still
pogba
master of the skies also pretty bad
i'm also extremely bad
like i don't know if this is true but i
heard
and and this is something you got to be
very careful about this stuff because i
want it to be true
so badly that i don't subjected to the
level of
academic skepticism that i should but i
heard that the news of the events of
september 11th
was broken to the cast and crew
of the master of disguise on the day
that dana carvey was dressed up in the
turtle suit
and they did like a moment of silence
with him dressed up
in the in the turtle suit
which is not funny for obvious reasons
but for other obvious reasons namely
that it's a very solemn
somber moment but he's dressed as a
turtle
is possibly the funniest moment that's
ever happened on planet earth
i mean like can you just imagine him
like bow in his
his head you know like with the turtle
outfit on
no for a moment of silence i mean it's
just like
it's just a it's just a very funny
juxtaposition
yo mercy what up all right we
at any time i'm always happy to see when
we got another streamer in the chat
i don't mean to make you feel bad chad
but like one
partnered streamer with a check mark on
display
it's like is worth 750 chatters right
there
but only 10 mods
we're in i saw fast five in theaters
how old am i i don't know the answer to
that question
but i have an anecdote to spin off of it
that i again i apologize because i've
told it several times
um but
when i worked in korea that's that's
when i think it was fast five that's
when fast five came out
one of my co-workers saw it in theaters
and uh
i said how was it
let's go mission accomplished and she
said it was pretty good but vin diesel
got fat
and then i looked up because i i was
like well i guess he's getting a little
older
i looked up a photo afterwards of fast
five
and he's actually got like four percent
body fat and
30 inch biceps she had no idea what she
was talking about
i was offended on vin diesel's behalf
he's like what one of the actors in
hollywood is probably like in the best
shape
she was like yeah i don't know he got a
little fat he's like jeez
ladies you know we got
there's no hope for the rest of us if if
vin diesel is fat
okay saved
a girl i knew said that chris hemsworth
had an average male body type
maybe marvel movies are bad
by the way we're going to die but we
might get to enjoy some of life before
it happens
yeah no kidding right tough crowd uh
is is he cute ah he's okay he looks like
uh thor
be dead saved saved
not saved what the mutually assured
destruction
okay that's good though it doesn't
matter we unlocked the character which
is what we were looking for in the first
place



yes all right
tinted cane has been unlocked
look at this no destiny and a bag of
crafting
i'm ready your mind will become dust
here
did he play the bike mission yet you got
me
that's a callback i barely remember oh
okay
i tried to pick up an item
and it turned into nothing
well no that's not fair it turned into
consumables
it's minecraft kane use use the bag
okay oh yeah okay yeah yeah all right
all right easy
easy so we're gonna we're gonna use the
bag
suck things up and combine them
okay not really
well dude they really outdid themselves
with this dlc
like this is crazy
i feel like i'm i'm playing hero in
smash bros
i'm hoping if you get eight consumables
and something becomes an item i'm gonna
be insanely pleased
watch this you ready you ready for this
try me let's go
who needs the forgotten dude who needs
the forgotten
yoink i honestly could really use that
key but
um uh uh yoink
yoink uh it has become
something
how do i i have made a beyblade
a zodiac baby hold q and it'll give you
the item
bro that's insane also this item
freaking sucks but
whatever this is cool check this out you
ready for this
i was trying to use bag of holding
i don't think that does that much damage
yeah i can't even figure out the the
crafting recipes in minecraft and they
gave you like a book in the game
that's like hey
here's the recipes so i don't have a lot
of hopes for myself
here but
all right let's just just do normal
stuff man just do normal stuff
don't get it twisted up why don't you
just do like a normal run
and try to try to stay
you know ahead of the curve here don't
melt your brain it's the last isaac run
of the day in all likelihood
oh it uses value okay i see
i see last one well it depends you know
if this is a short one and it's only
like 80 minutes long then then we'll see
how the mood strikes us after that the
isaac streams do go by
so fast
like i
that's what i was saying yesterday like
i was happy to get some variety in
with dan but like three hours of isaac
was not enough and then
dan probably streamed like five hours of
isaac himself today
we have oh dude that's a great
invincibility thank you
virgo i guess like they did an awesome
job with repentance
and the runs are just like really long
milk
well if it's got to be done it's got to
be done
i mean dude blood banks are like
insanely good now huh
all right
so i'm starting to pick up what's going
on here
we want to hold the spirit hard for
potential deal with the devil access but
now i'm realizing hold on
we don't care about deals with the devil
because
uh we can't pick up items anyway
[Laughter]
press control and you can cycle oh what
okay
to to what end
oh you can swap items out of the bag to
get different items
okay so like let's test some theories
all right
what if we got all red hearts
just keep it moving let's see what
happens
are you supposed to be able to win with
this character mercy this isn't like
rocket league okay this isn't like a
game where you can just
uh put 1500 hours in and then do like a
sick
twisty flip and then you know what's
happening this is a game
you gotta constantly stay on your toes
they're constantly hitting you with new
stuff at all times
you know what let's put a little
seasoning on this one
oh now we're talking little mysterious
liquid why didn't you say so
that's a great item
it's a one run
i don't know there's something like uh
yeah so people talk i i follow some
rocket league people on youtube
or on on twitter i should say they talk
about things sometimes
i do also mercy i'm not going to ask you
to answer for your
industry colleagues but i do see it
is it normal in the rocket league
community for
uh sponsored players like people that
are on
um you know esports organizations to
like openly put their teammates on blast
in screenshots about how like they
queued for half an hour
to to get a game and then their teammate
wasn't up to their standards
and then the chat log is just like them
endlessly ragging on their teammate
and then they post the screenshot to
twitter as well is that something that's
like that's the norm in the rocket
league community
because it seems like a lot of the
people that i follow
uh from the rocket league community make
a habit of doing that on the regular
no i i choose not to take this item
i know we don't have an oh but it could
generate but we never pick up money
but we could pick up money but we
wouldn't we'd use it to fill bag of
folding
i respect by the way because i've done
this before all caps lmao
is like i'm not going to answer but i
see what you did there
so i i i respect your uh
obligation to plead the fifth and
we can move on i'm not trying to ruin
anybody's
blow up anybody's spot i was just i was
kind of like a
man like i already i just put myself in
the shoes of the normie where i was like
all right like i'm really good at rocket
league and then uh f me i guess i got
matched up against the pro player and
the pro player is like mad at me
sorry oh we shouldn't we should just
pick that up
and then like in in all the screenshots
it also seems like there's like
solidarity
between the like both teams like the pro
is like guys can you believe i got this
trash teammate and then the other team's
like we're sorry dude it's not your
fault and i'm like man
it's really like raining it down on this
person right
but bro was it me is matchmaking dude
match matchmaking made me toxic it
wasn't me
okay just keep it pog okay there we go
there we go
i don't mind hp okay
oh hello apollo another verified
streamer

good item
[Laughter]
delightful
yeah that's probably prudent
okay still going strong
do it do it
edmund's back there pulling some levers
i i can't even think about like the way
this is set up man
in the in the in the back end like
i guess it's just i mean i don't know
there's a lot of items in isaac but
how many different recipe combinations i
guess it's based on value that's right
that's right that's right there's item
codes
i'm not good with phases okay don't just
pick things up just to pick them up man
there are 26 different types of
consumables is this some da vinci code
stuff because that's
the same number of consumables that
there are letters
in the english alphabet
did you ever think about that edmund
edmond edmond da vinci
pills well dude let's mix it up
minecraft sim uh his name is steve
[Laughter]
all right this is a pretty absurd item
i i'm just gonna let it ride we're just
gonna have some fun
do minecraft i you know what's crazy man
you know microsoft was in talk uh talks
to buy discord

amazon for a billion dollars
minecraft was purchased by mojang
or by microsoft in 2014
for two billion dollars
instagram was purchased by facebook
two billion dollars
discord there's a good item
discord supposedly
a 10 billion dollar valuation right now
that's crazy dude
yeah the instagram one i mean like a
this that's a steal in hindsight but
10 billion i mean 10 10 billion dollars
is a lot of money
on an organizational level and on an
individual human being level obviously
for a company it's not that crazy but it
also i'm like
it really puts it into perspective and
i'm like man
twitch on it for a billion dollars this
seems pretty
this seems pretty cheap
i i honestly think amazon got a really
good deal quite frankly
it was it was a billion dollars eight
years ago okay you're not wrong but
got a spare billy lying around no but
you know neither do they they you know
probably gave up a decent amount of cash
and then a bunch of like stocks but
twitch has high costs yeah but it's a
tech company it doesn't need to turn a
profit it just needs the promise to turn
a profit later
and then you can just keep getting
investment
look i don't know anything about silicon
valley but that's
that's my assumption of how it works at
least
like isn't it worse once you turn a
profit because then you have real
numbers
before you turn a profit you could make
any with when you're profitable you can
make infinite money
nobody knows man the sky's the limit
that's that's incredibly accurate let's
go
um i got an idea what if we suck up some
lucky panties
mom's purse
sad onion now we're talking
that's why discord's worth 10 billion
yeah i'm like dude how many people have
nitro
and then you start to think and you're
like well if it's not for nitro what are
they getting out of it and you're like
i don't want to think about it
[Laughter]
yoink
can't suck the sack
i guess they just get like i don't know
they get ownership of like the biggest
communication platform
i thought people were like who cares
right like i know you're like talk about
austin powers again
i thought people are like actually
pretty happy with microsoft right now i
know
obviously like you don't even have to
say skype to conjure the image of skype
in your head but
um i thought that people were very
cynical about like the
the linkedin acquisition but then they
mostly just like left it alone
so i understand it at least
it's what i've heard
just take it bill gates can keep his
hands off my shorts man
but be that as it may
dude that's lust it's not that good
because i don't take any damage but
it's the thought that counts here
mmm kappa face i gotta say we gotta
bring back kappa man you you don't hear
that much about kappa anymore right
like the what happened it used to be the
king of the emotes
because smiley face is just better okay
sure oh what the heck
we need to have like a like a in
memoriam for emotes that people don't
use that much anymore
what do you think apollo like
i feel like hey guys doesn't get used as
much as it should be anymore
kappa doesn't get used that often frank
or z doesn't get used that often
i feel like i'm reeling in the ears
yeah i don't even know what the heck
ella giggle even looks like anymore man
i can't even conjure it in my head
when are you supposed to use frank or z
honestly like whenever you feel like it
is my answer
if you think it would enhance your
enjoyment feel free just pop a frank or
z in chat
like sometimes you you know on twitter
you're like oh i'd rather just like see
didn't we buy a phd oh wait but we
couldn't get it now we got it
something's wrong i don't think so yeah
something's wrong
you're not in my bag right now
you know how on twitter you're like i
wish people would just post like more
dog photos
that's what frank or z is it's like you
want to feel included
but you also want to
you don't have anything to say just put
a dog in there man
put a bird on it hello chibly
how are you
are you having a good day
i was i was gassing you up earlier chip
you probably weren't here because it's
like early in new zealand or something
but
i was like chip is like a known entity
on on
twitter it's like people know who he is
and like tweet about him
without adding him in the tweet which is
i think the sign of being
like a known entity is when people start
tweeting about you but not at you
i had 15 000 followers on twitter before
i streamed
yeah like how did that how does that
happen
you be funny no it hasn't it doesn't
always work
next
lil nos x tweeted at him once really
chip did you get in his mentions because
you were mad about the shoes
x follows me on two accounts what does
that even mean
he has two accounts that follow you or
he follows two of your accounts
you know what i will say so and again
like
this is deep lore okay there have been a
couple of times where i've seen
chib like a tweet and the tweet that he
liked
i'm like that's that's chip i'm like
chib liked his own
alt tweet for sure for sure
but i've never felt comfortable
saying that until you just self-reported
because i've been like there's no way
that like this is too much
energy like the the the energy is
exactly the same
between chib and this person who's
supposedly not chip but is definitely
actually chip
a little sus exactly i sussed it out
i don't know what you do so sure
pennies and hearts don't make the bag
pog that much okay
let's store up some stuff man let's get
some stuff stored up
try to get a high value item
dead
we need this though
his other account is at dank easily
yeah like that was that from your alt
chib the tweet that said why do all the
hot girls follow
chib space lee or was that a real tweet
from not your old
i mean that's a better item man i could
definitely take that
coupon's pretty sick
i will if i can get to it in time i will
try to suck a troll bomb you have my
word
i wish it like i could see if chibly was
talking like if he was typing right now
typed you missed his message
that person doesn't follow me that you
didn't answer my question with the yes
or no though which is a little sus
yo pultratude polka thank you thank you
like you okay no all right so not your
alts
dead yeah so anyway i mean the mythos of
chip just gets deeper and deeper
but i have i i've successfully defended
myself against two ratios now
and i i think i'm starting i'm like an
uh i'm like an immune system cell like a
t
cell i'm starting to learn how to defend
myself against the chibli ratio
i didn't want to pick up that dime dude
come on that would have been
that's a high value card i got the ratio
vaccine yeah
exactly
nope
yes i i
wish i didn't suck up the dime dude
lucky penny is actually the best
crafting component you know what i had
no idea
i had no clue
remember the days when nl had a couple
hundred viewers and now he's on the
front page
pog look there's a very nice thing to
say
but i do have to say
you have me confused with somebody else
we kind of i don't know like i got
really lucky
genuinely and when i started to stream i
kind of like imported my youtube
audience
at a time when not that many youtubers
were also streaming so i had like
disproportionately low competition for
attention
which is sick and i recommend it so we
never really went through like an
awkward period
where like things were
you know we're trying to build up that
audience it's kind of it kind of started
at one spot and then stayed there for
like
seven years and then at the start of
2021 has
has trended upwards for the first time
ever so it's uh
it's an interesting era
yeah i just i simply inherited a few
thousand views from my father
one simple way to pay off your student
loans
in five years step one make your own
preserves let's go
step two return
your recycling to the recycling depot
for the deposit
step three live with your parents
rent free and then have them
give you all the money you need for a
down payment on your own place
let me out
say it say the line bart have your
parents give you a loan
at zero percent interest
yay i do love those
so that bit in case you're not as online
as chipley is
um that bit is like there's these
newspapers and
and like online magazines that always do
these articles like
how would this millennial paid off uh
all of her student loans in four years
and then it like there's all
it always starts with like bootstraps
bootstraps bootstraps
and then like the last part is like and
like my dad made me a vice president at
his company
and you're like oh it's very relatable
thank you
she live she simply lives in a humble
cottage on the grounds of her parents
estate exactly
come on man just do some damage come on
come on just get two steam sales
forehead
yo trolled
don't even give me i tried i tried
[Laughter]
don't even get me started on the like
that that stuff annoys me for sure okay
but um the other thing that annoys me
ten times more is that vancouver couple
who said they were living waste free and
they only made one bag of garbage a year
and it turns out they were just like
peeling their bananas inside of the
grocery store and then leaving the peels
with the cashier like that
every time i think of that post i i want
to just
become the joker i simply wish to become
the joker
it's not hard you know just simply
create garbage and then give it to
somebody else
but then don't oh dude i could do like
how much i could do 25 minutes on
recycling freaking right now
this is you know we have a shared
recycling room
and it's always like sometimes the room
gets
too full you know people are getting
vexed
they're they're partying which is fine i
don't care as long as they're not like
breaking
you know the noise laws or whatever
right um
hold on not good enough we will take a
bomb out of here next
um so like the the recycling room fills
up like
super fast and then people start
bringing
their recycling down to the recycling
room
but the bins are full so they leave
their unsorted recycling
in garbage bags next to the recycling
bins
and the the waste management company
refuses to take it
and sort it because of the fact
that it's on it's not that's not part of
their job description right
so as a result of that like it just
creates this like recycling death that
just gets carried over week to week
because nobody
like wants to do it for themselves is
is is extremely frustrating
and the smell i just take that as par
for the course
any time you go down into that room like
you know in the summertime you just
get ready for flies man okay hold on
hold on
glitter bombs is okay
but it could be better
now we're talking
don't care didn't ask plus those weren't
glitter bombs okay
okay dude this is a heck of a character
where are we on this right necropolis
one
are you crazy okay
we gotta we need this key
we need look it's seven cents to fill up
the bag
i consider that big positive
it's just another two hour run
honestly not being able to go to the
item room is not that bad now that i
think about it like who cares man
we're just missing out on consumables
maybe maybe you get better consumables i
don't know but
i'm not sweating it
anyway so that's my complaint the other
complaint
is um we have like a large
uh dumpster that cardboard boxes are
supposed to go in
but people like don't flatten their
cardboard boxes before they put them in
so we can only fit
like one eighth as much volume as we
otherwise could have been able to
if they would just click the or they
would just break the boxes and then
flatten them
very upsetting just flatten the boxes
and like i'm not gonna lie to you okay
i've never done it
but there have been times where like
sometimes they'll like
leave their like personal information
labels
on the uh on the box
and i'm like if you're gonna be uh
like lazy maybe i'll just
take this box and i'll drop it like back
up in front of your door it's a guppy
item
let's go i'm not gonna do it because
like
i mean like i have
i just don't want it i mean like come on
it's just one of those things it's like
a fantasy you have in your head right
where you're like
yeah i'm gonna one man wouldn't they be
sorry if i did this but then you don't
actually do it because it would make you
an insane person but
but i've thought about oh dude that's a
great item
yeah the jerk store called and they're
running out of you
we could record it and post it as a
prank
there's three items in there oh dude
that's pretty good okay
give me one of those give me two of
those
we have a key now too okay hold on
what's the difference
you're their best seller
dude honestly maybe you're right maybe i
should just become the joker
i've been flirting with it for a while
this whole joker business
i don't know what you are but i'm gonna
take it anyway let's do it
two oh okay every five seconds we get
prickly
i'm my dude what if i just showed up one
day in joker makeup
apollo would you still support me
you can do curse rooms for free now
let's go let's go all right
don't forget by the way you're here
forever no all right well
just it's kind of ironic right if you
didn't support me
when i became the joker you would just
make me that much more likely to
continue to be the joker because
the reason i became the joker in the
first place is because society
rejected me i appear to have taken
damage
you gotta be spiky you gotta be spiky
society loves you dude yeah only because
i'm a clown who makes them laugh
sound familiar
yep nope all right it's called the joker
is directed by the guy who directed road
trip
gripsy it's been a while
the joker isn't funny though uh did you
miss the second act of the movie where
he hones his stand-up routine
and he says i was at the mall the other
day
and this woman was like all these people
are being mean to me on social media i
turned to where i said
you know what i say so what media
i mean come on have you seen some of the
things people are saying on there
it's crazy like you ever consider maybe
getting a job instead i mean geez louise
pogba thank you thank you i had to
rescue the punchline out of somewhere
come off it man joker's awesome the
thing is
when i told my friends i wanted to be
able to stand up
when i told my friends i wanted to be a
stand-up comedian
everybody laughed at me well nobody's
laughing now
you're right f f
you can say that again you could say
that again
don't care didn't ask plus your chat
okay hold on hold on
no not yet not yet
looks like not even
close
ah let's go let's go
come on man i need some red hearts here
oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
no no the eternal heart has got to be
better than than
the or the golden arts got to be better
than coins
sorry for doubting that's all right that
thank you for doubting
starring aaron eckhart and rob lowe
yeah i think i could play the blood bank
for free but like i'm not sure like
it's like what you ever hear if like if
something's free
that you're the one paying for it
i gotta be honest this this kind of
appeals to me here
you can't all right well i'm glad i
didn't test it
boy i sure hope you're embarrassed for
that one
blue bossy's only friend
i don't know what i'm doing
yeah this run is gonna it's gonna be a
little long you know i
what are we at here it's necropolis two
okay and we wanna go alt path
not not all path true ending okay okay
okay
no no we just want to do normal run we
just want to do normal run okay that's
fine
we can do a normal run
you need hp i couldn't agree more are
you saying that i should not take deals
with the devil for no reason anymore
because that's kind of a deal breaker
for me
look at that we want that duble michael
duble bomb
what the heck is this members only shops
right
cool cool shop cool shop every now and
then
it's not worth i trust that i trust that
so we're going to replace a key with the
coin key with the coin and i'll be all
right
i just picked it up i literally just
walked into it
that's all right because we're gonna get
a better consumable here anyway yo what
if you could suck up the icy boy
what i stepped on creep coin with bomb
that's really good
but try to suck up the icy boy
oh i thought that could kill me man i
thought that could kill me
okay okay good stuff
secret room
saved not saved dead
decent decent
we need to take that eternal heart for
temporary survival
yeah i'm being a coward okay like it's
tough
that's that's good enough that's good
enough
he's calling the bonehearts eternal
hearts now oh son of a
you know what i mean look i've been i've
been live for too long five hours that's
on by this
side standards that's a marathon man
let me out
no don't kick it don't kick it
you were even less coherent one hour in
look there's a sweet spot okay
what if we tried to go the back way
you ready
[Laughter]
why just for memes just a simple
a simple meme
do not try this at home
other gamers you know they're out here
like oh what
i put my whole credit card limit into
the game and i didn't even get a gold
star sofia
i'm like hey man
i just dodged through the spikes
backwards
you ever consider getting good
chip what are your thoughts on that
what do you think of levar burden
wanting to host jeopardy
after i'm done with it uh
they can give it to whoever it'll never
be the same
i don't need the shop i don't need the
shop
better than dr oz no question no
question on that one yes sir
play judgment is spikey boy yo that's a
genius idea also you can go to the curse
room for free thank you right we're one
item away from becoming guppy thank you
thank you
donkey
yo yeah what if we put the rune in the
bag or better yet what if we use the
rune to double even more runes to put in
the bag
better yet what if we just press q to
double this card because we forgot that
we didn't have bag of holding as our
active queue
hey buddy you know what i think about
you all right carry on
that seems oh right we can't pick it up
anyway
i'm gonna be honest like we need to hold
the spirit hard
you can suck that up you can suck this
up you can get chemical peel easily
nine percent chance of a deal with the
devil never tell me the odds
never tell me the odds rip the item room
item room is is worthless
shop kind of hurts though because we
could get all these sweet items out of
it
like all you get out of the item room is
consumables
i don't blame you for not remembering
because i continue to forget as well
oops okay
yep fair fair but now you're stepping on
spilled milk so i bet you feel silly
don't lose the bone heart don't lose
the bone heart there is a tinted rock
you're absolutely right we're taking
them both and we need them both
take the polaroid okay we're still going
they at least let us take that i
appreciate that
nl i just engaged in the consumption
of uh a drug that is legal in much of
the world
what's going on in this run bro you
don't even know what's going on
in your mind right now
dude
don't even worry about
the run
dude you got worried about
your own business man
wouldn't that be i was i was like maybe
we should turn on slow mode
it would have really brought the bit
together
i shouldn't mess with them man like
walls are probably warping and changing
colors right now and everything
he's probably listening to some freaking
trippy stuff like the beatles or
whatever
getting freaking suited
it's very satisfying
call me crazy i think i'm gonna live
cool uh



hey everybody i'm excited
we did this yesterday but i i can't get
him out of my head
boy your bag and it's all i think about
we're gonna play
tainted kane because i very much
enjoy uh the bag of holding
i find it to be funny have we done we
literally have done nothing on the
post-it note that's a beautiful scenario
because we uh literally whatever we do
it's positive check this out
[Laughter]
already added one rune to this
dude i was dying yesterday i was anybody
watching jay's stream
jay might even be here as well hello
it's not meant to be uh negative towards
jay it's just
it's just very humorous uh he was
playing tainted kane for the first time
and like he couldn't figure out
what what he was doing with it we
definitely want a dime
let's try to make a super item okay
let's try to make a super item
so first he was like trying to pick up
items and all the items turned into
consumables and he was not very happy
with that
um still bad
but uh then people were like jay you
gotta like
use the bag so he would like use the bag
like he would he would press the bag
button and then like try to walk into an
item and it wouldn't do anything
and he's like what the heck is going on
like are you guys trolling me
and then we were like you got to use a
bag plus a direction
so he was holding the bag up and then
like trying to walk in a direction
because we weren't being so specific
it's like that classic uh
meme i don't know if anybody else had
this uh
pog i don't know if anybody else had
this assignment in
like elementary school but uh
in sixth grade our teacher was like hey
can you write a recipe or like a series
of instructions
specifically for how to tie your shoes
and uh you know everybody thought they
were so smart right they were like
just tie a bow on your shoe and then
like you're good
and then the teacher would just not put
the shoe on his foot
and then tie the tie the bow and like
the bow wasn't doing anything obviously
you know what
let's give it a try yeah he it was
i like i don't remember there being a
point to a lesson but obviously in
hindsight it has a lot of parallels with
like
uh with computer programming right like
the
the computer does exactly what you
wanted to do or what you tell it to do
nothing more nothing less
but yeah at the end of the day you got
to get so specific you're like first
you know open the tongue of the shoe
and then place your foot inside of the
shoe
make sure your toe is all the way to the
end after that
use your right hand to grab the right
shoelace and like so on and so forth
help me it's called the tongue don't get
mad
that's how i felt watching jay yesterday
we were like who's the
space bar item plus a direction and he
was like
you know space bar item plus a direction
and i was like
next to the consumable dude i was losing
it what i i
asked in his chat i was like what's the
the pepe emote that's like really angry
pepe with a wiggly tongue
but he doesn't have it enabled so i just
had the keck w instead
but that's the keg w still you know it's
pretty funny i can't be too upset
or just download the shoe library
somebody else developed that's true and
then
dude coding is so simple right like all
you got to do is type like tie shoe and
then in the parentheses you would like
pass
reference to the shoe object you want to
be tied like it's so simple
okay nickel good enough we're not doing
alt path we're trying to build
like a beautiful item here
i so i know you're looking at this right
now and you're probably going like he
hasn't gotten anything yet
you're not wrong but this could
potentially be an incredible item today
at least our first item being incredible
has me mighty
interested garbage pure garbage
pure garbage thursday baby
now we're talking add a rotten heart
into the equation i don't know what's up
with that
what does the sac hud describe
so the way that this works you can't
pick up
you can't pick up items as this version
of cane
what you can do is pick up consumables
and then when you get eight of them
in your bag of holding it creates an
item
the item is influenced like its quality
gets better
the better the quality of consumable
that you grant it
so you know not all these items are
created equal i'm trying to pick up some
of these like low value consumables and
only get high value consumables for now
but can i tell you as well like my brain
is destroyed today for the last uh
i would say the last hour the only thing
that's been rattling around in the old
bird cage upstairs
is you know that video of the guy
playing the bongos and going
it's just that over and over i i don't
know
what's going on psychologically there
but oh
excuse me i would like this rat jam yes
indeed rat jam i did not yeah jay's
subscriber notification exactly
i uh i did not see ed's most recent
tweets
but i will say i owns daniel today um
and uh he doesn't even know it and
that's the best part
but ed was sending me some discord
messages i was sending him some discord
messages
and then ed said until i was on
dan's stream i didn't realize like how
hard it is to carry on a conversation
while playing the game at the same time
and i said you ready for this one don't
be so hard on him he'll get the hang of
it one day
[Laughter]
oh like get on dude like get absolutely
owned because he was talking about
himself
obviously but then i made it the older
edit switcheroo
i made it seem like he was insulting dan
oh
hmm okay hold on oh baby
this is a top tier two dimes a rune
a nickel two bombs and a rotten heart
i gotta admit i'm not i'm not taking
anything out of the equation on that one
that looks pretty good
that's that's a pretty good item
you can't suck up a troll bomb by the
way one of the most common
questions can you suck up a troll bomb
we're gonna now we're just gonna go for
like mass effect
we're gonna suck up as many of these as
we can and maximize our items
we have we have some coins back here
you can actually troll face we do a
little trolling
poly famous is eight gold bombs holy
crap man
that's tough d12
like honestly that might not be that bad
because we don't have uh
we don't have a space bar item but
i feel like we can do better like what
if we replace
coins with hearts
battery pack i mean like in a certain
situation i could say
let's just say what does civic to say
 baby
okay let's just say macbook pro baby
okay now we can't buy anything from the
shop
anyway so we might as well just buy the
items and see what we got there
freaking freaking monday baby yeah
check this out yoink
got him okay uh garbage but you know
what
it's garbage that could contribute to an
early item so like
i'm not gonna be too upset temperance is
kind of interesting
i think let's pop this down here
suck it up baby yeah
ventricular razor how about no scott
how about no speed upgrade
how about yes
it's not so bad i can look at this and i
can be proud of myself i think we did
pretty well on this floor
could always be better but excuse me is
there a no that's not a secret room
this feels like a secret room to me and
also swallowed penny
an attempt was made
i'll use a bomb just one one
simple bomb
well anyway we out here this is two
galaxy brain for me
dude i actually like ed did me the
greatest service
you could ever imagine he basically made
a zany version of every character
like that's so nice for me
can you suck up friendly spiders
get away from me go on get out of here
yo oh that's cause we got hit by a greed
head i thought i was a genius
for a second i was like oh my god we got
like swallowed penny or fanny pack or
something like that also known as
infinite items okay now i'm realizing
things are a little touchy here but you
know what getting hit by these guys
it's not so bad we're going again we're
going for mass effects right now
who thank you secede oh no i'm gonna die
instead don't no thank you
give me some red hearts please i will
live easily
you need to unlock tainted judas he's
incredible i thought i
did but i don't remember what he do
i'm not sure but yeah basically like
they made every character in the game
have like a zany version
which is quite exciting yeah you can use
ev
every item in the game has its own
unique recipe
as i understand it at least so you can
indeed a
charged key you can indeed make the same
item multiple times
how's your toe today so after being
gaslit by chat yesterday
i looked um up some photos of broken
toes
and i would say that my toe is not
broken
it may simply be a bad bruise
which is a positive i think
i mean it's still like it hurts fairly
i mean it's not that i mean i went for
like a two hour walk yesterday so how
bad could it be right
on the one hand as we've established i'm
just built different i don't feel pain
um but on the other hand like
can't be that bad if i went for such a
long walk i guess we will never be
leaving this room
never mind we'll just take the top path
go to the doctor at least i broke part
of my leg and didn't go to the doctor
okay i mean that's like
look don't i'm i'm
just being polite okay that's insane
like when you break your toe you're kind
of just like you know you're along for
the ride it's gonna hurt for a bit
maybe they give you like some
painkillers you break part of your leg
like that's
crazy
you gotta obviously you gotta go see the
doctor
okay good item i take
let's try d1 you know what
this actually seems like it could be
very good
i feel like you could take a d1 double
amazing consumables and get a
consistently higher quality of recipe
i'm actually just stupid
officially an idiot
okay just grab that you're good and then
you know what
no i like the toe has no swelling it's
uh
it's just it just aches a little bit i'm
not too worried about it
i know like and i'm not just saying that
like oh you know i'm so tough but i
genuinely think like i think it's just a
combination of of
stubbing it really bad uh
plus being older than i've ever been
so taking longer for you know injuries
to recover
if i was a kid i probably would have
been back on my pogo stick the next day
hello cobalts hello cobalts
check this out cobalt bet you've never
seen this one you ready for this
[Laughter]
he's done it okay i'm gonna go to that
special room because i think we can do
it here man
are you up to date with the latest chess
drama
um i'm i'm not might surprise you but i
am
not what did somebody play f5
the horror
yeah it's not with levy again is it it
involves a fist fight oh my god
dude jess is crazy
like that it involves a fist fight it's
like you're selling a netflix uh
a netflix original it
involves a fistfight a zoo
and the run for oklahoma governor
uh you know what let's suck them all up
this is an interesting one we got three
pills
a nickel a rotten heart and a bomb and a
fistfight
add that you know what let's drop it and
see what we got
it is five bombs but
i'm not impressed i consider myself
unimpressed
i i replace
that don't impress me much i replace a
pill
with a half red heart we get the eraser
hold on tomo would like to enter the
room
welcome my son welcome back
come on down you're the next contestant
on
get into the box please
come on man just get come on man just
get in no tomorrow just get in the box
buddy
what the heck is this stuff on the
bottom right
i guess you're not ready for that one
yet
but your kids are gonna love it
now i'm on top of them it's the classic
like
domino right here's the domino tomo
wants to get in the room
now i'm on top of my headphone cord like
it it just never ends
do you drop your space bar item whence
you craft a new one
um yeah i don't know it's possible
i assume it probably gives you an item
pedestal
or does it just get rid of your old
space bar item i don't know
no it gets it just gets replaced it gets
turned into consumables
okay there's there's some temptation
there then
my cat bites my feet i hear that dude
my cats do not do that but if they
if kate wasn't around to keep him in
line who knows what kind of mischief
they'd get up to
yo by the way kate bought a weighted
blanket
and you know i i always love to talk
about products
on on the stream that i love like the
air fryer for example i've been talking
a lot about the air fryer
um i'm here to tell you
on the flip side weighted blankets are a
scam
and by a scam i mean not a scam but like
not for everybody first off and you're
gonna be like
no duh but that son of a gun is heavy
like to an insane degree
check this out check this out
like it's i i knew it was weighted but i
didn't know it was that heavy
for one uh
i don't know what i'm doing here yeah
keep it moving
secondly it just like i don't know
it it's i so kate used it for a night
and then i woke up in the morning and
saw that the blanket was folded
uh up on the like nightstand and then
she had just you know gotten back under
the shared duvet
she was like i hate it and i was like
how bad could it be maybe i'll try it
and then i put it on and like 20 minutes
later i was like i gotta get this thing
out of
off of the bed i just found it very
uncomfortable
i was like it's not like it's a it's
kind of heavy
and b like it's not a good
blanket i guess and again if
if you're uh if you use it and you find
that it works for you i'm not trying to
say like it doesn't work for you
all i'm saying is that it it did not
work for me
is way heavier than i expected to like
folding that thing i was like this is a
workout man
is it like the snuggie no it's not a
joke like the snuggie
maybe you need a lighter weight well
yeah i do need a lighter weight like the
weight of my existing duvet which which
is apparently like perfect for me
i i i mean i i didn't get one in the
first place
it's my my wife's uh she's on the the
weighted blanket wave but
don't come on man don't steal my charge
me a second here
i did i was thinking like a heavier
blanket could make me a little bit
stronger but
you know because you're kind of like
passively lifting while you're sleeping
right like i mean it's just it's like a
full body workout i'm not saying it's a
good one but
it's something
um i mean i really want items
i guess so we might as well give it a
try
you can always cycle that out golden
razor
how about how about no scott how about
no
maybe if you wore it as a cape dude i
don't even want to think about this
that's crazy
i'd never recover oh hello hello
what's this what are you
uh we're gonna suck up some eternal
hearts i'll tell you that much so here's
how you do this
you pick up everything your d1
you get rid of a single penny it becomes
hp
heavy sleeper energy we get rid of a
single bomb
it becomes trinity shield
i think they did buff the spirit hard
chance in the last patch as well
so trinity shield is pretty
good but
what if we could make it even better
dude
yeah yeah you can't get me there's a
blue fire
idiot oh breakfast means
oh crap breakfast means you don't have
that item unlocked
now that i did not know
starting to think i should have popped
it like at the start of the fight
hey hey hey hey what if you
stopped being a loser who was pp in your
pampers and you started
uh just getting trapped in the corner
where those blue fires can hold you
nice try i couldn't tell you the the
enemy tells
all i can tell you is that they're baked
into the dna somewhere
oh freaking shanova
okay what do you got for me good any
it's literally just a key piece okay
uh i think i'll take trinity shield
[Laughter]
i didn't that makes sense it makes sense
that a key piece would do that okay
um you know what kill me you wouldn't
look at that the man's a genius he's
actually one of the smartest gamers
most people won't admit it because
they're scared hey ninja zombie thank
you thank you
appreciate the gifted subscriptions
thank you
triple digit iq confirmed not trying to
brag
i mean i don't want to make anybody feel
like
you know like they're not worthy here
but i do have to say
i scored 100 on my iq test
[Laughter]
so if you want to talk about
intelligence uh
you should know you're dealing with
perfection here yeah yeah we'll try at
least
why not right
suck them up no don't hit me
bro the minions are harder than the boss
thank you for your sacrifice okay okay
can you pick up troll bombs you cannot
pick up troll bombs i know it's going to
be a commonly
asked question
it has been attempted
um not not just by me but i should it's
been attempted by twice as many of you i
should know half as much as i would like
to
and half as many of you i know twice as
much as i'd love to

hand crafted bespoke bits
we don't just do the thing where like we
repeat something
and then like you laugh because you
recognize it
we don't do that anymore we leave that
to the lesser
uh twitch channels that are unable
to create bespoke bits
like we don't really endeavor to make
you laugh here we endeavor more than
anything else just to make you think
like that's if i if i could inspire like
just a few viewers out there to
to really like reach for the sky

secret room's gonna have a bunch of red
hearts in it
we're gonna easily live oh
no
i'm in a very cursed position for a
father right now
i hear both crying baby and vacuum
cleaner like what does that leave me
with
how do i handle this situation
leaves me in a pretty tough spot quite
frankly
just keep playing isaac just bomb the
donation machine that's a really good
idea do you have a bomb
you could give me like maybe you could
like courier a bomb
to me and uh then i could execute the
plan that you're so confident in
perhaps you could you could just have
one post mates to my house
then i would be eager to uh to fulfill
your request
until then we're kind of we're kind of
stuck here
yeah okay don't i've decided don't post
mates a bomb to my house
[Laughter]
i've decided it's a truly terrible idea
okay i'm gonna give up hp for nothing
oh and and you know that's probably
going to lead to a good recipe but we
got to strike a balance here
battery i don't think that's like
i don't think it's good enough man i'm
just going to pick this up for now
it's it's not good enough with our
existing space bar item
i think okay grab these let's replace a
coin with a bomb
that's just a slap in the face and we'll
move on
nl who's your favorite tv chef you know
who i like
i don't know his name but he's a very
fancy
lad uh he he's very
like he has a high opinion of himself
he has well manicured gray hair
and he always wears a suit
no it's not gordon ramsay i i mean no
like
stop suggesting obviously incorrect
answers
i i won't even know his name if i hear
it quite frankly
you're gonna have to find it for me
does the order of the items matter it
does not
is not jacques pippin i know jacques
pippen some of you weren't around uh
for the food streams and it shows let's
replace a key with a
with one of the uh x-ray you know
honestly x-rays probably pretty sick
because we can get more consumables out
of it
is it zakarian okay does zakarian look
kind of like stanley tucci wearing a wig
from the hunger games
not exactly but does he have the
resemblance
of stanley tucci wearing a wig from the
hunger games
kind of i think that's him yeah i think
that's him
i think you got him i'm not gonna look
it up i would rather
oh my god i would rather uh i would
rather just live with the idea that it's
that we got him
okay no coins we're doing a no coin run
here
should be safe for now look him up
i'm not no i'm not going to look him up
because i think you guys found it so why
waste my
my data cap on a google search
okay that's a little i'm a little
annoyed
what the heck is even that
alabaster box a sacred offering
okay let's use it i don't know that'll
be interesting
oh at first i was like it did nothing i
was highly upset
and then it gave us breath of life and i
was even more upset
honestly okay this is no
coin percentage
we don't need to protect our devil deals
let's build the item of the century
that seems yeah so it's like uh sack
alter but it doesn't sack anything and
it gives angel items or maybe it does
sack something well it didn't sack
that's for sure
free alter with a with a big charge
can you put troll bombs in your bag
nobody's ever tried it and i'm not
i'm not gonna be the first
that's a mystery that will remain until
a later day
because i i don't have the stones to try
to accomplish it
don't hit me you jerk
dude this is gonna be a great item this
is gonna be
a grand item are you seeing this thing
no coins well i mean when i said no
coins i meant no pennies
nickels are built different yes sir
you know what's nice is that like when
it gives you breakfast you know you just
move on to the next item
oh-ho-ho that's not too bad that's not
too bad
can i live with this is this good enough
to live with
i don't know yes it's been buffed now
recently as well
okay even better thank you chad big
brother's watching
i know it's cause he finished the stream
early today because of the punisher
tournament
little brothers watching i hope not what
if we just
suck up a bunch of red hearts i bet that
gives us hp
it's it's science it's as simple as that
oh baby
you're right oh frick
that is sick or young heart honestly
yamaha would hit the spot right now
sunny d and yum rum rum
an item fit to eat
yum yum yum yum
no no don't say it
me and my yum
what the all right that's good it's good
excuse me exclamation point recipe
people are trying to give recipes in
chat can we please say exclamation point
recipe
thank you thank you it's okay like i
don't want people to
you know be upset i'm just saying
exclamation point recipe will tell you
everything you need to hear
we're just chilling we're just chilling
exclamation point zakarian it posts a
photo
of stanley tucci from the hunger games
too
you know what this could we could use
some electricity
it's like uh woody harrelson says in
venom
when i get out there's gonna be carnage
dawg come on come off of it man
you can take the card too yeah i'm
fishing for for just red hearts
or well red heart spirit hearts and
charged keys it's a very complicated
recipe
you might have to go to whole foods to
get it
it may not be available at your local
store
hmm
yeah we're not gonna do alt path on this
one i think uh
or a true ending i should say we're just
gonna go straight to uh
maybe like the the default path i don't
think this run is that good
so basically we don't care about the
tinted skull because the tinted skull is
just uh
oh let's go it's just um
the uh the fool card
might have a heart in it that's where
you're wrong brother that is where you
are wrong
excuse me it's not just a range up that
should be a tears up as well
it is still a card to suck all right
you're right and
you know by the way you're now breathing
manually as well how does that sound
i just didn't want you to do anything
even simple inconsequential stuff on
autopilot i want to make sure you're
like
handling it yourself um as a result
because that's the only way to make sure
that you optimize absolutely everything
is that you're constantly aware of it
and you handle yourself
heavy heavy teacher energy i'll admit
you know if no one's going to admit to
it then looks like everybody's skipping
recess
looks like everybody's breathing
manually now
saved
i always breathe manually it's more
efficient i i hear that oh what
i was doing so well too i uh that's
i i try to blink manually as well for
efficiency's sake
i find it actually like helps out a lot
i save probably like eight percent
caloric intake a day
by not blinking more than is necessary
stop talking
all right but then stop calling out oh
you're 17 rooms ago there's a card on
the ground you know
we're trying to i'm trying to banter
here all right i'm trying to have
conversations with people and
people are like you know don't care
didn't ask plus there's like half a red
heart six floors ago just
just chill out poindexter sometimes the
teacher's gonna spell things wrong on
the board okay
you know don't don't be the person who
corrects their uh
the teacher and says oh i thought you
were going to assign some homework right
we're trying to get into some jokes here
we're trying to get into some life
lessons and we're trying to
dare i say maybe like heal a little bit
maybe heal the world
maybe just do what little i can to try
to you know make this big blue marble
that much better
i just got here what's the what's the
deal with the the sack
uh the the sack is the bag of troll
bombs
it's a new item uh that allows you
with with a little bit of finesse
this new shot speed it's exclusively
sucks up troll bombs
and then turns them into beautiful items
not the bomb oh
all righty that's that's a good item
i really needed
you guys to die a little bit faster
sorry i was i i will admit i was meaning
at your expense
this is the bag of holding you can look
up on
on wiki feats what what bag of holding
does
it's uh it's a very interesting item
it's a good item
it's a lot of fun this one like
specifically when i came into today's
stream
you're okay i i said to myself i want to
play more tainted cane
i want to learn something
okay almost got killed there no big deal
red hearts please
i mean that's really good if we live
how does this guy know about wikifeed i
read that article that was like uh
i think it came out yesterday we gotta
try that's that's actually pretty sick
um about like this journalist kept
finding like as soon as she posted
photos on instagram they always ended up
on wiki feed
like seconds later uh so she interviewed
the guy
who for some reason like agreed to the
interview
about like why he keeps posting her feet
and he was just like
he basically just owned it you know he
was just like i just love
feet man and it's like uh you know
it's i like to share the photos of feet
of beautiful women and
i'm like i guess i can't really blame
you
no it is hilarious like apparently
wikifeed has like a rule
that like um you can only
uh post the feet of people who are well
known enough that they have an imdb
page
so every time he wanted to i knew it was
coming too
every time he wanted to post the photo
he had to like go check
imdb
yeah mouth has one there you go
we can't get to those because the spikes
oh wait hold on
hold hold on though the spike hitbox is
a little
it's a little spicy but i mean i don't
know
hold on no this this i'm a genius yo
glass cannon's
sick now right yeah yeah glass cannon is
cool now
that being said i'm still scared to use
it
at least until i know what it does
and sadly it's got to be done
you don't get screwed until you get hit
with it
be scared of what happens when you get
hit
maybe we'll just never use this item and
instead just say that the reason we took
it temporarily
was to um get a reusable
amount of consumables from
that was very nice uh from the
candle when it popped although also like
i probably don't need to tell you this
losing the candle is a pretty big loss
but
we got some good stuff going on
nonetheless let's go
there's no downside to using it the risk
is just holding it
oh man like that's great intel but i
also
kind of wish you hadn't told me because
i felt so safe and now i'm scared
now i realize i'm not safe
also that's not true you've just been
trolled okay
no it is true you've been anti-trolled
i've been super trolled it beats me man
i got no idea like
i mean here's the thing i plan to not
get hit so like
it doesn't matter if you get trolled as
long as you don't get hit
no it is you've been anti-anti-troll
repent what the heck
i thought this was mom and i was like
what's going on
why is she up against you really think i
won't spawn up against the wall
why not man why not
when you have it you just take double
damage for one hit
what the heck that's not bad at all it's
like that's amazing
i did i i saw some people talking about
this item and they're like oh new glass
cannon is actually like run winning
i mean this is really good
i can't see the tears but that's not
true that's a lie
come on man
i don't know what's happening
we're moving up though
it's lies all the way down
me
hold on you guys just chill for a second
okay
you know i mean like getting five bombs
is not the worst thing in the world
come on
what's the sack item called uh it's
called
bag of hodling it's for diamond hands
only
hello hello
okay baby's all right i'm glad to hear
it
i think she's just going through a phase
of i need to have
mommy
no that's what i so i was talking about
it in isaac episode today
i apologize because it's a little crass
okay
but hear me out on this one oh my damn
glass cannon broke
i was like i think that the baby sleeps
better
with me than like if it's just the two
of us than if you're around as well
because you're also like
the baby's food supply and i was
thinking like man if i was like sleeping
and there was like a bag of uh like
potato chips or something next to me
i probably wouldn't sleep as well either
because i'd be like in bed and be like
oh just one more handful right god
i don't i think that by removing the
temptation to eat that's what makes the
baby sleep better when when it's just me
and the baby
i think it's possible i think
that's nice to hear
oh that's nice
that's a nice sentiment
that's an insane theory uh you know what
else is an insane theory on uh that
maybe you've heard of it's called
gravity
yeah it wasn't so insane once the apple
fell on isaac newton's head
see
insanely smart thank you what an
insanely smart idea
hey sorry i don't want to scare the baby
i'm dead hey
that rub fell apart pretty quickly



all right well we we failed yet again
with tainted kane but
uh we do have tainted samson unlocked i
think it's time to take a look at this
uh i have no idea
what uh tainted samson does let's figure
it out for ourselves here
first off he's bald curse of the blind
as well
he's not bald he shaves you know what
you got to try something
i figured you know like he's
he's getting more and more red every
time he takes damage
is he is he growing more hair did the
hair get bigger
hmm hmm i mean he
oh no dude he do be looking
quite red right now this is
this is where you start the whole dar no
i'm not a coward like oh my god dude
he's so freaking red
what the heck
it only lasts for a temporary time okay
um oh so he's got like almost uh like a
a taurus or something like that sorry
i'm a taurus
sorry sorry i just took out my tibia and
smacked you with it
i'm a taurus you know what tauruses are
like
that's his bear zerk meter would you
like to simpson run berserker
donkey's jawbone that's pretty cool um
we don't say that word around here
i but i would agree with you that is
pretty pog
well yeah get him well you gotta get get
him
hey hey to you sir
no no no no no no no no no no no no
dude i gotta tell you i took the baby
for like a two hour walk yesterday
it was very fulfilling got a little
exercise got a little uh
fresh air
feels good the only time
that it's scary to have the baby outside
is when i went to the grocery store and
then you get in like a lineup
it when you have to stand still the baby
is not happy
so you gotta like stand still
but leave enough space around you to
constantly like move
the cart back and forth just a little
bit
otherwise she goes like freaking
thermonuclear
no this time i i did not see dan baijar
also known as uh destroyer on my walk
this time
but ev every day i hold out hope that i
will see him yet again
who destroyer um one of canada's
greatest recording artists
a vancouver legend
permission to go home so my face isn't
beat red for my family photo tonight
no i didn't meet him but i'm like 75
convinced that two weeks ago i saw him
when i was walking around
what's my evidence i saw a
six foot five man with
salt and pepper curly hair and a beard
who looked
exactly like him and he was also wearing
cool guy rockstar clothes
and i was like i'm pretty sure that's
destroyer
but i didn't say hi because i was like
it's covered but it you know
post covered i get vaccinated maybe i'll
oh you know
if i see him all walked up i've been
rehearsing what i'm going to say i'm
going to walk up to him
and i'm gonna say hey what's your
favorite destroyer song
and he's probably gonna punch me in the
throat and then be like
you know shut up but
yeah and then i'm gonna he's gonna start
complaining about the electrical
inference oh like you're doing right now
look at that genius place
i'm really hoping
hey what stitches does damage what what
excuse me
uh saved
like not a ton but it's something okay
it's
it's actually pretty bad but on a room
like this where i can't get close enough
to hit enemies anyway like
it's something
just just there you go
please hold r i'm not that kind of gamer
like
if that's what you're looking for like
you you know you can find it elsewhere
i'm not the kind of gamer i can say this
because he's live playing among us right
now
i'm not the kind of gamer that would
like start playing a hotly anticipated
uh
piece of dlc hold r until he got a good
item and then quit the game as
as soon as he discovered like one
mechanic that he was unfamiliar with
that made things slightly harder on
himself okay i wouldn't do that
i have i have too much respect for you i
have too much respect for the game and i
have too much respect for myself
this is it's just not the way i choose
to run things okay
we're not gonna hold our instead what
we're gonna do is uh
you know suffer through this run and
then eventually it'll look like we're
gonna win and i'll be like oh i'm the
greatest player of all time
and then i'll lose and i'll be like man
we should have held our
that's that's the that's the egg way
okay
telefrag does a bit of damage um i i
hear ya
but i feel like it um may also do like a
little damage to me
when i tell a frag so i kind of don't
want to
do your dirty work no more
it gives you iframes
sure okay it actually gives you iframes
all right with an orbital that's
actually omega sick and you see
if we had held r we wouldn't have known
we wouldn't have known we never would
have interfaced with anything that
presents even the slightest degree of
difficulty in our lives
and we would have lost this never mind
it would have been for the best
nl you were just talking about someone
being scared of new mechanics and here
you are
refusing to use a new mechanic and then
there there i am using a new mechanic
seconds later and then calling it out
making you ashamed of your words and
your deeds
look at that i mean literally seconds
like you geniuses hold
on hold on oh
okay it doesn't fully work but that
would have been cool
what makes a man turn neutral
okay we take we
take
we take dan giesling is
phil dunphy tell me i'm wrong i can't
tell you you're wrong
uh but i'll pivot you know i think
phil dunphy is one of television's
all-time great dads
whoops how did i not get hit there
modern family especially as it went on
not a uh a wonderful show
you know got got a little like snoozy
for my taste
but phil dunphy one of the best
modern contemporary television
characters
hey annel my grandfather my grandmother
gave me a two foot by three foot
norman rockwell what should i do with it
in my college apartment
um you should just put it up in your
in your uh like on top of the toilet i
think
is really like that's the like where you
would put the
the george costanza on the couch
photo just put it there
got him i think it's the best idea yeah
next
next to the photo in my opinion the best
place for it
would be to put it uh next to
that poster of all the the girls
uh sitting on the the deck of the pool
and their banks are are painted like the
pink floyd
album covers alternatively
if you're looking for something a little
spicier you could put it next to your
tony montana shooting a machine gun
poster
right next to the foosball table and i
think that would give people something
to look at when you're
when you're uh we put them in probation
because they wouldn't stop spinning
even though we said you're not supposed
to spin you're supposed
we don't allow you to just spin on this
table
or the fight club poster
so i talked about my college roommate a
little bit yesterday for real when i i
moved in
to my dorm room by the way this is
before it was cancelable so just give
cut him some slack here
i moved into my dorm room my roommate
was already there
and he was putting up a movie poster on
his uh
on our concrete wall the movie poster
was
harry potter and the philosopher's stone
also known as harry potter and the
sorcerer's stone in the united states of
america
and i was like i so i
got like the cool roommate huh
[Laughter]
yeah there's a freaking freaking sexy
pin up man
why not why not
yeah why not i i don't know what i'm
doing here
but i think like the telefragging with
stitches has now become
the theme of the theme of the run not
the theme of the run
i did have a poster on on my uh
wall as well because i was like oh look
first off people are gonna come to my
room and they're gonna think i'm not
cool because we got this harry potter
poster
so i went to this record store in my
hometown and uh i bought
a flaming lips yoshimi battles the pink
robots poster and used scotch tape to
just put it up on uh
on my wall and then instead like
you know what i thought is that people
would come over and be like oh my god is
that a flaming lips
yoshimi battles the pink robots poster
that's awesome that's so cool
what instead happened is that people
came over and went like
hey what's that poster is it from like
an old video game or something
and i was like no it's
a band called the flaming lips called
this album called yoshimi
uh battles the pink robots and
they were like oh okay cool harry potter
poster by the way
oof pain
okay did we go to our item room on this
floor yeah we got trash bean
we've not been to our shop though
that was the first step of me turning
into the joker
[Laughter]
cool if you'll excuse me i was not even
close
just walked right into it i had a
gorillaz plastic beach poster when i was
in college good times
you know what that would have been sick
because if i had that poster when i was
in college it would have meant that i
invented a time machine
isn't that weird i was thinking i was
like man we're like old
oh i got taurus in the item room which i
know is like obvious
but i saw a tweet yesterday that was
like um
did you know like 20 years ago today the
song butterfly by crazy town
was number one in america and i was like
man 20 years
that's a long time ago like i was alive
for that i've been referencing that song
forever
um but it really put it into perspective
when i was like you know
now crazy town
and their song butterfly
is closer to the release of rush's
moving pictures than it is to the
present day
and then i started to think like
i'm the smartest man in the world
then i started to think like you know
what
else is weird oh oh
send them he's so smart
is that like overtime
things get like uh truncated and
flattened you know
like my parents grew up like they were
teenagers in the 1980s right
but in my head like the talking heads
and the beatles are basically from like
you know just a couple of years apart
that's how i conceptualize it
but for them it was like it's completely
like they're like oh the beatles are
like my parents generation
and the talking heads is like
contemporary but for me i'm like nice
all
grandpa music cool grandpa music but
grandpa music nonetheless right
so i guess what i was trying to say is
that like in my
in my daughter's head she may
think that like tom sawyer
by rush and crazy town by butterfly
basically came out at the same time
which is i'm struggling to deal with as
a human being
these are the thoughts i have when i
brush my teeth one one fully formed
coherent thought
i did see the take that outcast is
greater than the beatles
i'm gonna tell you i disagree but i
don't disagree by that much
i think bizarrely outcast is
actually like beloved but still kind of
underrated because they haven't made
much contemporary music over like the
last 15 years
like speaker box and the love below is
actually like
i i like them but they're closer to the
bottom of the outcast
discography than they are to the top
and those are like the ones that people
have the most nostalgia for
get them okay we really need like some
kind of stat
up here i think i mean i think we could
do this run but
we gotta we gotta pay maybe slightly
closer attention this could help
i don't know this might have been a
little foolish let's just buy some
spirit hearts
yeah dude big boy is like so underrated
too don't get me wrong andre 3000 he's
like
uh you know he's he's aerodyne
we freed our tears shot speed up luck
down i can live with that
um nobody's trying to disrespect andre
3000 but
uh
big boys is disrespected
i'm a genius just because he raps about
like the more
earthly carnal pleasures and
you know andre 3000 is a little bit more
like you know he's got some
some kind of prince in spot inspiration
going on there
i'm like hey man if you look everybody
loves
three thousands verse on uh the artist
storytelling part one but if you can't
respect
shine blockers off of sir luscious left
foot then like
honestly like i'm starting i'm inclined
to believe you don't know what the hell
you're talking about i'm inclined to
believe you got bad taste
like peter jackson peter jackson's debut
film my man
i'm inclined to think that you don't
respect
the silence that serves as the
foundation of
creativity i tried to teleport
come on man
yeah shine block is it's an amazing song
for one
and then also the music video is so good
because it they filmed it in such a way
that it seems like uh
gucci mane is dead which he is not
um as of the time of this recording
but every time they uh
they have a gucci mane verse in the
in the song they play like old uh
footage of him in black and white i
don't know he it's possible that he was
incarcerated at the time
but
it's just humorous that's all i'm trying
to say
okay you know what perthro hey guys
there's nothing wrong with that
nope
[Laughter]
no thank you
i will not i know what you're gonna say
but but
but but but when it works it i mean you
could tell a frag with it and it's not
no dude no i know like i know it's
changed i know it's changed
i've changed too though a lot
it's marginally better now
they buffed it
i love the stitches man
are you a wizard actually makes you
shoot straight for uh
a bit now it's true we used it about i
would say 90 seconds ago
and remarked upon the same thing
it was it was a pivotal moment
yeah no i don't want iv bag i'm happy
with stitches man
although wait is iv bag isaac's heart
infinite money i don't think so
i don't think so
not anymore thank you appreciate that's
good intel
they nerfed that we nerfed those
yeah there's only one way to find out
you ask chat
mission accomplished
i this is gonna sound insane i think
we're gonna become guppy right here
good start
saved
that could have gone terribly wrong
let's do it again
saved
i can't believe you didn't die to a
single orbital
i don't have invincibility why am i
running straight into enemies
okay just chill
they've nerfed orbitals a little bit are
they closer to your body now i thought
someone did an interview and they were
talking about
orbitals are like closer to your body
now
hitboxes are smaller too told you
we're guppy in spirit
i lived
[Laughter]
uh this is spicy
yeah i'm i gotta be honest like i'm not
trying to say it's a negative
to a huge extent yet tainted samson
i don't think he's all that in a bag of
potato chips just yet we we haven't
really been playing him
uh well and we did get
uh dunce cap and we're basically just
trying to use stitches to do everything
but he is a little
uh i'm just going to say it man
a little unzany right now but i think
that we can
we can work around it i mean this run in
in many ways this run is in the perfect
position
it's a it's a great time to buy low
plus i also i'm just gonna go ahead and
clip farm and and call it
i think we're going to get a tractor
beam in our item room
i just have i'm hooked on a feeling
not this one but like the next one
this should be a good time
it's pretty fun because like if you just
make like a single mistake
you're dead so let's
saved saved i walked into i walked into
the spikes okay
walking into the spikes uh the the rock
better than getting hit by the spikes
danke a board
i don't know i think he's about to pay
out
we we do what we must because we can
anyway
this cake is great it's so delicious and
moist
look at us still talking when there's
beans to be
eaten cause they are so good
beaten and it did
let's go let's go
gone and done it again y'all
i have no idea what we're doing
dude portal 2 came out uh 10 years ago
it's pretty crazy and like there's still
people out there that don't even know
that the cake is a lie man
which is why i keep bringing it up like
like
what you do you say frick life take your
lemons back you make life take the
lemons back
baby cave johnson baby portal
glados the cake is a lie baby
still alive
sorry thursday baby glados baby uh a
spirit heart don't mind if i do
don't mind if i do um
don't mind if i do you knew it was
coming
when was the last time you played
rainbow six siege
i'm gonna guess that it was it was
probably
two months after they added dokeby
oh spicy spicy room
we're gonna kill him like this i hate to
say it but
oh we could just kill him like that even
better
late december back in 63 exactly
oh that's true yeah when they did that
zombie event i played i played a little
bit of the zombie event as well
there is an operator who looks just like
uh
hassan mods haas mods
if you got it spam it i'm not gonna pay
15 to unlock them but uh yeah yeah it
looks just like that
i'm trapped and screwed
you knew it was coming but we're coming
back anyway all right well um
slash marker tainted
samson sucks question mark



all right let's do it judas
true ending beat the boss win the game
step one no fear
fear is the mind killer step two die
all right start again it was worth it an
attempt was made
oh no i'm a streak
but imagine if it had been good dude
imagine if it had been good
the clip farming the potential would
have been through the freaking roof
is it xl not an exo okay so we're doing
it then clip
farming
i'm telling you okay you're gonna say
this guy just keeps throwing the runs
like what's his problem
i have no problem you're about to have a
problem with how good i'm doing
for example did you see this
and guess what now we're in the shop for
free
you're right this this is not tainted
judas this is merely regular judas
one of the strange things about
repentance okay i mean this is just rude
but now i can't stop myself
um one of the strange things about
repentance is that you have to unlock a
character to play as them which is what
we're going to attempt to do here
i apologize it's unbecoming of me uh
there was no need to
to be so so snippy but once the sentence
was constructed fully formed in my head
there was no getting away from it
hold r i dare not i dare not
i do you're not wrong i think little
chad is actually like
like very good now game is harder
red hearts are more valuable little chad
is now
giga chad
he's done it
did you hear i don't know if this is
true but let me take you on a journey so
the first thing i'm going to say is
i saw a tweet yesterday that said did
you know gigachad is a real guy
and also he refuses to do any uh
interviews and he doesn't know what a
podcast is
uh but then like i i disbelieved it but
then i saw another tweet today that was
like are you aware of the fact that
hugh grant's middle name is mungo so
literally he's named hugh mungo grant
and then i was like that can't possibly
be true and then i looked
it up on wikipedia and it's freaking
true
his name is hugh mungo grant i mean hugh
john mungo grant
but it's hugh mungo grant
like it's close enough and also then i
saw
like if you go to his wikipedia article
look at his
uh look at his signature
like what is this guy getting away with
like do you see his signature it's just
like a single check mark
like i get it he's a popular actor he
probably has to sign
like a lot of uh art autographs and
stuff like that but like come on dude
anyway long story short
learning a lot on twitter these days i
did also see justin's pharmacist name i
dare not repeat it but it is uh
it is unbelievable i i looked at the
tweet
and i laughed and then i walked to the
fridge to get some water
and i just like i did the thing they do
in like a tv show where they
like think about the joke and laugh
again i did that like five times
oh it's great stuff
i mean his name is just it's it's so
good hey come on come on man
there we go worth
have you heard about the guy who changed
his name for free sushi and then can't
change it back
what did he did he change it like like
it was a consumable item
farticus 12 thanks for the gifted subs
thank you
spartacus
good appreciate it he changed his name
to salmon dream
i look it's not a name i would choose
for myself
but that's actually not that bad
there are worse names like that's just a
celebrity name
oh taiwan only lets you change your name
three times
it seems like a way to keep the you know
wheels of bureaucracy turning
i guess so now he's i mean salmon dream
is not that bad
it i mean i would let me put it this way
where my name
sam and dream i would probably use one
of my three
wishes to change it but
i will also say like with all due
respect to
mr dream uh it seems like he's changed
his name
three times in the past he should
probably be familiar with the rules you
know
like it would he can't really go in
front of the court and like plead
ignorance
okay so this item is bad but like i
don't care because
i'm a legend
it's not good anymore it's actually good
no they they buffed or they nerfed it
they they buffed its bad sides
they got rid of the damage upgrade and
they got rid of the ability to spawn
demon hearts the aoe is kind of okay
i'll give you that one
but i don't it gave up a lot of hp
for it hp's been real quiet
send it
he's the greatest gamer
wait no but hold on he's no he's a god
gamer officially god gamer status
look at that
you know what and then just for that
just for that
we're going into the curse room we're
going to spend half of that on the curse
room
that gives us a bomb to access the other
tinted no to access the other double
bomb setup
we're fully in the isaac flow chart now
hey
to bomb marty confirmed
confirmed this is a second secret room
too so i'm pretty stoked
ice cold baby oh dim bulb finally a
reason to use our item
regular secret room the man is like
he's nonstop
oh sam and dreams mom changed his name
as a kid without him knowing
my two cents that should count as one of
his mom's
infinity stones instead of one of his
to me that seems like perhaps it should
be
refreshed at age 18 or something like
that
that hardly seems fair
it's dry baby baby
yeah refresh on level up
i so we've established like many times
i don't know much about the law
however i know they say like
pleading ignorance is not a valid
defense right and i think that makes a
lot of sense when it comes to like
murder
but you can't just get in front of the
judge and be like you know
sorry i didn't know murder was like a
crime
um
but like what about those really obscure
laws this like you know
no riding the horse on saturday i feel
like sometimes you could
couldn't you just walk into the
courtroom and be like honestly your
honor like this law is like obscure
come on you got to cut me some slack on
this one
those aren't enforced i mean
that sounds honestly like were i a cop
i would probably be the best cop because
i would enforce
only laws like that that nobody has a
defense for i would be overpowered
i would generate more income for the
city than any other officer of the law
ever
they'd probably have to nerf me to be
honest
excuse me sir uh your right shoe
is untied on a major thoroughfare that's
six months in the
in the joint buddy
guess what they would fire you yeah like
to the top of the employee of the month
power rankings
in all likelihood
i sends you to six months hard marriage
like dennis miller did to ashton kutcher
and brittany murphy in the film just
married
help
that hurts that hurts
would you enforce the unmowed lawn
statute
if if if it's in the book of horcruxes i
have to enforce it i don't make the
rules okay
i'm not gonna do the homeowners
association's bidding for them but
it was cameron diaz but whatever hold on
movie where sentenced to marriage
ashton kutcher dennis
miller the movie is called what happens
in vegas you know what you're absolutely
right
wait no is it i i believe you're right
what happens in vegas
2008 romance comedy
cameron diaz ashton kutcher hold on i'm
spiraling right now
wikipedia what happens in vegas does it
star dennis miller it does all right you
got me
we'll take the l on that one all that
for a drop of blood
i was confused because he's all ashton
kutcher and brittany murphy are also in
a movie called just
married he's really cornered the market
on movies where he was recently
engaged in the act of exchanging
nuptials
24-hour vip permanent
dude i'm getting hit too much
it's like an episode of beat the geeks
man you just you just beat the
the movie geek
wasn't he one of the friends with
benefits movies okay like so now you're
very you got me very confused okay
because there's a movie called friends
with benefits and then there's a movie
called no strings attached
and then there's a movie called
just friends which are all very
different but star
a conglomeration of people who in my
head are very similar
just friends i believe stars ryan
reynolds and amy smart
and then there's no strings attached
justin timberlake
mila kunis and then there's friends with
benefits which is like
mila kunis ashton kutcher i've never
seen any of them for the record
friends with benefits is mila kunis
justin timberlake
worth it natalie portman and jason
sudeikis
okay i should have known dude
i shouldn't wrong no it's actually
ashton kutcher
ashton kutcher and jason sudeikis look
i'm never gonna remember this i'm not
i'm i'm choosing to
to snip this conversation where it
stands
yeah then there's so confusing man
because there's bad grandpa
as well and then dirty grandpa
but in bad grandpa he's dirty
so bad grandpa i think is the johnny
knoxville movie
where it's like half pranks half
scripted
and then dirty grandpa
is
robert de niro which is just insane
like why the heck is robert de niro in a
movie where he plays like a horny
grandpa
he's been in like 17 martin score says
he films
why not you know that's a good point i
think if i was like an independently
wealthy
and like critically acclaimed actor at
some point you would probably reach
a level where if you decide to continue
to work
it's much less about uh
you know the quality of the project but
also like hey i can get paid and it'll
be fun
that's a good point
like i know that this is like a uh the
forward forward forward re
forward forward like everybody knows
this from til
on on reddit but like that michael kane
quote rings true for me
where he was in like jaws three or
something like that and it's horror jaws
four and it's horrible
and then someone was a reporter was like
hey how do you feel about your movie
being garbage and he's like i haven't
seen it
but i have seen the house that he bought
and it's marvelous
what is it michael kane's not
responsible for like jaws 4 being bad
i'm inclined to believe that if you go
and see
the fourth jaws movie you probably like
deserve
to be ripped off quite frankly
like you got to exercise some media
literacy or something like that
i mean he's he's just a mercenary yeah
that's like i'm sure he did his job to
the best of his ability
it's not like he wrote it said michael
kane writer director and star of jaws
four like they were just like hey here's
like
you know three million dollars and he's
like oh
the shark oh no
the shark is quite prodigious
you're gonna need a bigger boat
we're going to need a bigger boat
something like that you know i've never
seen it i never
will but i would love to tour his
vacation home quite honestly
it sounds it sounds nice
all right we're saved told you we're
guppy wait this is from last run
he's a shark and he eats human mate
haven't you seen the lost three films
okay this runs popping now dude this run
is popping
we don't need to go to the shop
anyway it's like why why should he care
oh farticus thank you
again for the subscription why why
should
michael kane care if uh if jaws four
is bad like i get that there's actors
that do like daniel day-lewis is like
he refuses to be in bad movies but i
also think that
uh hypocritically wasn't he in like
valentine's day
he's in one of those i think maybe i'm
thinking of jeremy irons i don't want to
slander
daniel day-lewis without
cause he
he's in daniel day-lewis is in
ghostbusters 2016.
hold on as as a cameo as himself or
did he play one of the ghosts
jeremy irons no alec guinness
genuine class all right lisa your turn
uh jeremy irons uh
jeremy's iron
hey we got this nice little ball here
for you look at that
necropolis one we're good to go okay
clearly i remember ironing on the board
seemed a little wrinkled shirt ooh
but we flattened the wrinkles
applied some heat some weight and then
we spread
how could i forget
i mean we gotta take these so we can
become guppy
oh we were so close to
peak clip farming we were almost there
stem cell
would have been a great clip yo that's
pretty sick that could have been
well no it couldn't have been a guppy
item now that i think about it would
have been a great clip dude
okay i need your help to call out tinted
rocks because we are low on hp now
because i
i'm shooting for the moon it's a really
good run
who almost stepped on it
anyway long story short if you're still
holding the grudge over michael caine
being in jaws 4 like get over it man
i know like it's been on a lot of
people's minds but you know this is a
time for forgiveness
cut him some slack okay
toasty i always appreciate the banter
attempts
i'm gonna i'm gonna plead the fifth on
that one i don't know if i have the
ability in in
my banter skills to make that happen but
i'll
you know i'm doing my best i appreciate
the attempt
don't forget to leave a trinket how
about you don't forget that we left the
trinket two floors ago
how about you don't forget okay
oh i can't believe i was worried about
hp we have a bone heart
if that took my bone heart i would have
been highly upset also that was a lock
down that gave us stats ups am i
am i losing it
i don't hate bluetooth no so like so for
people that are watching and like what
the heck where did this come from
sir toasty a mod friend of the channel
also uh editor of uh the most disliked
video in the history of my youtube
channel
not their fault but i i wanted to bring
it up nonetheless just to make just to
keep them honest um
said f mary kill bluetooth headphone
bluetooth speakers
uh bluetooth keyboard and i i opted not
to
interact with the discussion
however we're gonna go to the item room
yeah
yeah um however then there was some
discussion about bluetooth
out there you know here's my thoughts on
bluetooth
i have uh i have samsung galaxy buds and
and i think that they're fantastic i use
bluetooth headphones
ooh baby every day when i take a walk
with the baby
um but i'm going to pivot off of that
discussion to a new discussion which is
so many people out there still listening
by themselves
playing music on their speakers when
they're outside in public man
it's crazy churlish quite frankly i know
we use the word a lot but when there's
multiple and and i don't think a lot of
people would agree with me on this by
the way i think that i'm being
overly amelia tory if you will however
if you are in a group of people and you
guys are like playing music on your
phones
at least as long as there's only one
person playing the music
i genuinely don't mind i i
i wouldn't i would be like hey come on
we got to be uh oh god curse of darkness
man
you know we gotta we gotta be a little
nicer right
um other people are trying to enjoy
their time outside as well
however what really grinds my gears is
when it's just like
one guy and he's listening to his music
like i was walking the other day there
was a guy he was like a 55 year old guy
and he was listening to despacito and i
was like you really think
like you have to crank this we've all
heard it
no one's going to walk by you and be
like oh my god
what is that it sounds so good is that
despacito
like that no i don't i i guess i don't
understand what you're trying to get out
of it right like
you're trying to get some props or
something it jammed after five
are you kidding me
but i will say i and this is like a half
funny half sad
as in it's funny for me but maybe sad
for the person in quest
but there was like a like an older
woman sitting on a bench when i was
walking by and she was listening to
music on her phone
and uh it was closer by nine inch nails
so i was walking by and i was like what
the heck is that and
you get my car i want to feed you from
the
inside and like
she wasn't even vibing she was just
sitting there like
but she was i don't know she's cooler
than i am that's for sure
calmer than you are dude
what's your take on the who's getting
the best head meme
i had to mention it because i saw it um
i have no idea what that is but
i'd like to say that in principle i
support it
oh no i know exactly what meme you're
talking about
as soon as somebody said alvin and the
chipmunks i was like oh i've seen that
cursed image
yeah now i have decided i am not for it
i am actually
extremely against it
come on man it is theodore for sure
though
is he being felt from the inside
stop
got him
i don't have a joke there remember last
year when i was on tick tock and like
every time my tick tocks went viral
which was every time because i'm amazing
at zoomer social media
um kids got in my mentions and we're
like hey you look like the villain from
uh alvin and the chipmunks and i looked
it up and found out there's
david cross who's dead ass like 35 years
older than me
i guess we're taking backstabber
oh tinted skull thank you thank you
tinted skull
can you can you help me find this tinted
skull
and also help me get away from myself
it's the bottom room with the trinket do
care did ask
plus you helped thank you
david cross was mean to nardwar and
that's unforgivable
so like i'm gonna i'm about to say
something that might
uh i don't know it's food for thought
i definitely think david cross
is kind of a a butthole
but i also sort of think like
what do you expect you know like did you
if you if you listen to the guys comedy
like it's
cynical and it's sarcastic
um
like i don't i i guess i'm like do you
think that you would meet him in public
and he would be like i'm so happy to
meet you i'm sure he's like
he's probably like i just want this to
end so i can like get back to my own
company
we grab whatever
he was nice on harmon town well you know
that's the thing is like even when
people are like
you know maybe a little bit impolite
that doesn't necessarily mean they're
like impolite at all times
you know but you might catch him on a on
a day where he's like not having a good
day and he's like
you know i got things to do why am i why
do that
why would you do this okay hold on
where's my room
isaac
trinket's already been dropped don't
sweat it
yeah so both both sonic youth and blur
have have very bad
um interviews for sure
with with nardwar but i'm also like i
would
like to think that if nardwar
interviewed me
i would be like whoa this is a lot of
fun but i also think that if i
if i were not aware of nardwar
before i got interviewed by him i
actually might be a little
freaked out like i might be like
like actually how do you know stuff so
much stuff about me
i i think i don't think i would be rude
but i think there is a
chance depending on my mood that day
that i might be a little bit standoffish
you know
i if you know who he is then you're
rolling with it and you're like having
fun
but if he's like hey remember your best
friend you haven't talked to for like
you know
30 years well what did he give you in
second grade and i'd be like i don't
even know that man and then he'd be like
look at this it's a copy of uh
fifa 94 on the game boy and i'd be like
dude what the
i would be like the david blaine viral
video
cheez-its
so like i'm
i'm not trying to cut anybody that was
mean to nardwar like any slack
but i do also like kinda i i get how you
could be freaked out
i guess is what i'm trying to say but
like you know being rude
like the worst they're the ones where
they just treat him like he's a total
loser
there's one i can't remember no you know
what it's not nardwar
it's kyle from youtube who then went on
to uh
be on snl he's trying to interview like
some people from the
san francisco giants and i i don't
remember
uh if it's the most notorious ex san
francisco giant
um but he basically just tells like
literally tells him to f
off and is like you know calls him like
a nerd and a loser or something like
that
and you're like
dude no it was not barry bonds the other
[Laughter]
one
no no yeah aubry huff that's the one
you you got it
i don't remember if it was aubry huff
but i do
kind of remember seeing the interview
and then being like wow who's
this guy that's actually just being like
basically like
a huge bully not just like dismissive in
kind of like a cool way
i know how that sounds but like you know
blur
and and sonic youth kind of acted like
they were they were too cool for the
interview
um but aubry huff was basically like
go die i was like i think you might not
be uh
that nice of a guy to be honest i think
you might be kind of a jerk
blur literally pushes him onto the couch
you really think i won't
push you up against the wall
i think we're ready here
yes that's prison mike just
get over it okay here we go if you vibe
hard enough the feelings can't get to
your savings
the vibe so hard mf and felins try to
stop me
i had that michael scott line stuck in
my head all day
it is it's a great line you really
expect us to believe
you're someone else you really expect me
not to push you up against the wall
all we got to do is make it like as long
as we live
we're okay maybe we beat the boss maybe
we can't
hey prison mike what would you say is
the worst thing about
prison ah the food
every day they served us like a gruel
that that and the dementors
i do like rat jam that's sad and i also
like rat jam that's just thinking about
jammin
in prison you're somebody's b word
and you you my friend would be the bell
of the ball
we're just vibing nothing weird about it
just vibes
ryan from the office is a bad character
well
i don't think he's a bad character i
think he's kind of like a bad guy
but i honest and i like the office as a
show
catch i think it would have been
a show that's a little bit more up my
alley
if more characters had kind of taken the
ryan path
and just like completely gone unhinged
like uh like that's one of the things i
admire about peep show
is that they kind of like always
took it too far
you forgot the key shard did i don't
think so
i think it's in the next boss room um
but there is a tinted rock oh thank you
there is a tinted rock look at that um
right here is what i meant to say
like in peep show like you know
people die and i'm not talking about
like
ed trucks kappa getting dictated
i think they eat someone's pet in that
show
as well it's been a while i haven't seen
that season for a few years but
like they weren't afraid to like you
know lean into the the dark humor
whereas on the office i felt like you
know maybe because of the fact that it's
like on
nbc they kind of always had to give it
like a heart of gold
mind you it's better like the office
season one
where it was more kind of uncomfortable
was actually
worse than the office that came after it
at least up to a point
but i still think they could have gone
just a little
just a little harsher
scott's tots is actual torture though
see i
i everyone's got a different tolerance
for it but i never felt that way
i was always like you know i just find
it funny
i just think it's funny that i have seen
the british office
and i actually i mean it's hard to say
because they're two different flavors
right
like the british office i in terms of
its
quality versus density is much better
it maintains a consistent quality
throughout and is
like i enjoy it more but like
the regular the regular the american
office did also run for like
i don't know like 10 seasons and most of
them were pretty good
oh thank you for the tinted rock thank
you
how many episodes does the british
office have it's like one of the longest
running british shows of all time it has
like
14 episodes in a christmas special
there we go i stole that joke from the
good place which i have not seen
ha ha
oh baby
oh baby
uh it's all bad but it's the thought
that counts
so
yeah it's all bad i'm out
golden girls is one of the best shows of
all time you know i've never seen it but
it genuinely has
like one of the greatest theme songs in
in
television history it's like the
rockford files and golden girls up at
the very top
thank you for being a friend
mommy down the road and back again you
saw that huh
you're a friend and a confidant
oh baby what about fireflies theme song
firefly
fire fly for fire
fly fire fire firefly
what about arrested development arrested
arrested development
of rested development arrested
arrested development
hello you unlocked seduj
he's done it i told you we were gonna
make it man
bro did you see so that that post about
like jerry's hallway is impossible went
super viral we already talked about it
did you see though that somebody uh
basically that was really dumb um
showed like what frasier's floor plan is
like they mapped out the floor plan of
fraser's penthouse apartment
that mfer is living large dude
i mean i get it like he's he's a famous
uh psychiatrist and
you know he he comes from means but like
you see
he's got yeah there's like five
bathrooms in that place dude
it's freaking nuts i was not smart
i saw jay do this
i don't know how you do it and don't get
hit so i'm just choosing not to shoot
because i think i get
twisted up and confused
yeah they did an amazing job with this
boss i was talking about it in the
episode that goes live today
or sorry it goes live in two days i
think
the one i recorded today but like i
really think
that like one of the most common
criticisms of all the isaac dlc
was that they never really knocked it
out of the park
with the boss fights for the end game um
but this one is like they did an amazing
job
look he's surfing
why why just stand there man like they
did an
amazing job on this
i still think there's a pretty
reasonable chance we're gonna die
which is the hardest boss dude
like don't get hit saved
just tanked it right on the raid on the
freaking chin um
what's the name of the other large boss
that you get if you go
the full alt pathway
i still think full alt path boss is the
hardest right now at least until i learn
the patterns
that's mother okay okay
yeah bumbo's loving life down there man
we do have infestation 2
and i am one of the greatest flappy bird
players of all time so there is that
we'll see delirium's still tough for
sure
i mean even hush is like annoying man
not today
i mean apart from that i would say like
um
bloat
he's so tough dude hello bloat's so
tough
the memes the memes we've replaced all
of the enemies with bloat
i don't know the meme okay
okay spiders i need your help please
you gonna tell bumbo to stop being
useless you really think i won't
push you up against the wall
come on little chad
fair enough you got me
[Laughter]
whatever though we unlocked tainted
judas
so let's try one tainted judas run



one more run left in us before we start
playing some rainbow six sag
um we're gonna check out dark judas for
the first time he eats shadows and
dark farts hmm sounds like you should
see a doctor
okay uh let's go into the next room and
try this out i have not spoiled this for
myself i
i don't know what this does but we're
about to find out
okay okay okay so it creates a line
that does damage so we want to like
slice enemies up
maybe you're invincible oh you are
invincible during it
okay even better even better
they finally added an anime character
it's about time oh he pauses them too
when he goes through them that's so good
[Laughter]
that's really fun that he like freezes
them in place so you can do an oh my
shinderu you know what i'm talking about
you know what i meant maybe i didn't say
it properly but you know what i meant
don't even if you have self-respect
don't type it in chat
yoink destroyed
well i'm just going to be straight up
with you i don't really see how we lose
this one
i don't know how it could happen i know
like you're gonna say that it's comedic
timing setup that's not my intention
oh it wasn't ready okay that's how we
lose this one uh you know
you know what's uh an interesting idea
for this
what if we got
a sick little freaking speed upgrade you
know what i'm talking about
imagine if you got a speed upgrade on
this run
so you could hit like everything all
enemies
we also appeared to get stronger
i don't know what did it but we got
stronger temporarily there
oh it gives you full speed when you do
it okay fair enough good to know
the more enemies you kill with the dark
arts the more damage you get
okay okay we got it all figured out man
look at this
little lunch as well okay can't have red
hearts but that's all right
if you'll excuse me i have received some
messages on discord let's see what
people are saying in here
oh yeah it's uh it's a mess okay hold on
hold on
it's a message it's not immediately
relevant but we'll be responded to later
instant hp my man is a genius
too good to be true can't take my eyes
off of you
you've got dark arts in your hand
in modern discard would be banned
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes up
i love you baby
now that's a song oh dude now that is a
song
check this out you ready for this
is it a good song yes absolutely a good
song
i would stack it up against
i i would i honestly i put that up there
in the in the nine out of tens
i think it's that good
what else would be a 9 out of 10 someone
great
by lcd sound system
come together by spiritualized
tightrope by janelle monae
and of course my personal favorite happy
birthday
hey now ever since they legalized
cannabis in canada have you noticed an
influx of people
smoking it outside or is it mostly done
in private
it's a question that i think is like
impossible to answer
um in vancouver because even
pre-legalization
the whole city smelled like weed at all
times and i'm not even saying that in
like a judgmental way
people were just doing it like in public
anyway
like it was it was flaunted um
i will say i do see people
like i've been taking walks pretty much
every day as mentioned i know you're
like shut up about it quit bragging
um minimum i see like
at least three to five groups of people
walking around
you know openly smoking like every time
i'm outside for sure
i think we take nothing although i'm
actually kind of interested in the idea
of taking shade here
but just because we could walk into
enemies with it anyway
let's take shade but not take nine lives
yeah it could be interesting yeah i
don't think guppy's the right play here
why not well because we can't take red
hearts so i'm pretty sure that by
picking it up
we would indeed get nine lives but we'd
get nine lives at one spear at heart and
kind of like what we got going on right
now i think we've got a decent base to
build hp from you never know when
when spirit hearts are are gonna fall by
the wayside
you know would be sick with this i don't
i don't know if dark arts actually gives
the contact damage but imagine all the
people
living for today man
oh
now that song by the way not a 9 out of
10 at least not on my
scale can i tell you why
a a true artist would have told us what
that world would have looked like
instead of just being like imagined you
know
i wonder is anybody made like a implying
all the chatters
everyone agrees
implying we're a hive mind
a monolith on stream
implying all the viewers
sharing just one brain
imagine being a streamer
okay it's just okay sorry that's i
couldn't come up with the final lyric
faltered right at the finish line
oh well an attempt was made
that was pretty good though thank you
thank you throwing runs for zayn no that
does i mean i get what you're saying
but it to me that doesn't fit it was
gonna be so at first this starts with
the implying and it's like bad faith
arguments and then it was going to be
like wow imagine being a streamer you
know like in like there was going to be
a punchline that was like about how
embarrassed you would be to be a
streamer
you get the idea yeah
pointing at others for blame
couldn't be this streamer yeah something
like that
something like that man that could work
oh dude imagine gaming i'm gonna quote
tweet that again
in when e3 actually happens and is
actually gonna get like a billion likes
that's a tweet that was just not there
for the we we launched it too early
you're not ready for that one but you in
the summer is gonna love it
joint get sliced
anyway yes people do be partaking here
no doubt about that
dude the damage buff is sick as well
you should check out get lucky by daft
punk it's the song of the summer
i know what you're saying i get the
picture
nl with such great banter and no dead
air
would you have liked to be in radio
so i think like it would have been fun
to be in college
uh radio
like i'm gonna be honest with you i'm
not proud of it but i wasn't doing much
else in
undergrad i think running a radio
station or running a
radio program at my university could
have been fun
but like the radio industry is also like
totally screwed i think
like my mom used to work at a radio
station not as like on-air talent but
like in the administrative side
she said like you basically only
do well if you're i don't know maybe
like
if you're super amazing and like popular
and and you're in talk radio maybe but
also like
for most markets it's like if you're in
the morning show
if you're on the morning show that's
like the only profitable
uh or the only lucrative one and you
gotta wake up at like three in the
morning
in order to get to the show on time and
like the lifestyle seems pretty hard to
begin with so
i feel like we got kind of lucky
that streaming came about for me
plus yeah yeah because people driving
the work i think is the predominant
uh market for the
for the radio these days sorry it takes
a little focus here
plus you're bald exactly
i think if like streaming falls apart
like
you know there have been times in my in
my life where i've been pretty anxious
about that like that's why i went back
to school for coding
i don't know i don't know what the the
x's strategy would be now but probably
some kind of like podcast
like i mean it's not that easy you know
just start a podcast forehead but
i think it might be a pivot that could
be done
bring back check the wire that you know
could happen
i mean like it might i'm i'm really glad
podcasts exist
because when i was a kid my
favorite time on the radio was when um
there was a a syndicated little radio
segment called the rest of the story
and it was basically like really well
told like today i learned where it was
like a story you didn't know
like the real history of like how the
space shuttle came to be or something
like that
and it would always end with like and
that's
the rest of the story like the stuff you
wouldn't heard on the news
that was sick but you'd have to listen
to you know
12 uh hours of kenny chesney just the
hope that it comes out
oh there is a tinted rock here so a
podcast is basically just the ability to
summon that at any time
which is pretty sick
i think i i approve of podcasts
controversial opinion i know if anybody
was wondering where i stand on podcasts
i would place myself in the for them
category
what are you meat cleavers slice but no
dice
it's bad right ah
oh that's the dodge of the century clip
that
don't clip that clip it before i say
clip that it makes it seem
so much worse if i say clip that at the
end
him
i was watching the pokemon play through
you said you'd definitely do the eva
podcast
and that was two years ago i agree it's
been two years so
get over it
shinji get in the robot there you go
there's episode that's that's the finale
shinji getting the robot
done mission accomplished we watched it
just right i don't need to watch it
because i know he gets in the robot
chop the boss in half oh god you just
reminded me
i forgot that what this item does is
that it makes the boss
double or if whatever whatever you chop
you fight two of them that are half the
strength no thank you
yeah shades like pretty bad huh
the only what i'm trying to do now it's
going to get me in so much more trouble
what i'm trying to do now is uh
leave shade in the hitbox a little bit
longer
you could dark arts both of them you're
absolutely right
dude then just step in here with a
battery next time
okay you guys have got to line up okay
dude i actually think this is good i
know how it might sound
not not well done there but i actually
think making more enemies so we can hit
them all
is the ticket i think i think you got it
figured out i think you saved me
that's what i've been saying all right
fair enough fair enough then
that's what you've been saying fair
enough if that's what you've been saying
then i'm not trying to cause problems
your dark art saved me so yeah i'm like
i'm pro podcasts
i'm pro audiobooks as well but you got
to find the right one
like i've been listening i i think i've
exhausted every finance
audio book that's ever existed so i have
a bunch of
credits on audible um
and they were like hey people who uh
like the books that you're reading also
loved this book called surrounded by
idiots it's a book about like
you know how to talk to people when they
have different personality types and
good communication
like good strategies for communication
styles and stuff like that
and i was like i like to communicate
well and i got to be honest with you i
don't mean to like
you know insult the author or whatever i
listened to about two hours of that and
it was like
i think that they might have made every
single thing up in this book
because it was like they were describing
like personality traits and they're like
does this sound like anybody you know
and i was like yeah it sounds like
everybody i know
decisive but sometimes likes to make
careful uh
consideration you know quick to act but
also quick to deliberate and i was like
this
is everybody man that's just every
do you hear anything of your own
personality in this uh
i'm like yeah i i identify with all four
of the personality
axes that you've invented
i just i i don't know i i mean it has a
my professors hate that book i am a
minor in psychology dude
i i've never felt smarter because like
look i'm not trying to put an entire
uh country on blast here but on the
cover of the book it says something
ridiculous like
you know the a best-selling book in
sweden or something like that
and i should have known i should have
known
when something says new york times
bestseller you got to take it with a
grain of salt
if something says it made the top of the
swedish charts i think you can just be
like i like that that doesn't mean
anything
so i i think honestly i wasted an
audible credit on that one i'm sorry to
say
what up now swedes
i i'm familiar with the video
i'm from sweden i mean i'm not like
saying that in sweden people have poor
taste
i'm just saying the book was written by
an american
and as the book was written by an
american and presumably published in
america
the fact that it uh says hey this is
like the most popular
psychology book in sweden is a bit of a
weird statement you know
it's like avril lavigne being huge in
japan so i mean i'm inclined to believe
that this run
actually sucks
like why is this so bad now
i mean you know taking the shade was
like obviously not a good decision
but like we have no damage upgrades
you got no damage you're flat
i mean we have to take oh no we didn't
have to take it at all we definitely
could have used black rune
um but be that as it may
yeah no we're probably not gonna take
the alt path and just die as a joke
but i appreciate the insight
we'll see what happens you know we gotta
we got a long road ahead of us
temporarily
so anyway if you if i i was gonna say if
you have any book recommendations let me
know but actually like
don't worry i'll figure it out save your
keystrokes
i'll find something
because i don't want to just say no to
the expanse like 20 times
or read like you know das capital or
something
um anyway
uh moving on
it's very simple okay here's how this is
gonna go we're not shopping
we're gonna get a tinted rock on the
next room that's gonna carry us with
enough hp till we get to the shop
after we pass the shop there's gonna be
spirit hearts in there we're gonna we're
gonna purchase them
that's gonna give us enough hp to
survive and our item room is gonna
contain
magic mush i'm calling my shot
very good start to be honest with you we
absolutely need uh the coupon
it's gonna do some incredible work for
us sorry cleaver you had your chance
that could be interesting actually it
does do contact damage
have you read house of leaves you
reference it a lot i actually did read
house of leaves at uh
at probably like the best time in my
life to read that book i was like
18 and it uh you know it blew my mind
i think probably now if i read it i
would be like oh come on man
i get it non-traditional formatting
but at the time i was like yo this is
sick dude
it's a spooky book it's a little spooky
you're not wrong
there's there's a little spookiness nope
nope nope saved
gotta read the halo novels can i tell
you as a 14 year old i read the fall of
reach in one day
i was so uh enamored with it
i read the book in like a single sitting
it was like a like a 10 hour read or
something like that but
i like i started reading it saturday
morning
took a little break for lunch
and then uh we kept reading it took a
little break for dinner and then
finished it right before bed
hold on we need black roon no we don't
need black room we need the full card no
we don't because we're just doing a
normal run
so we can take black run what the
no no i'm a dummy i'm a fool
i'm the fool uh this better be good
that would have been a good item to
blackroon to be honest with you
it's all right the inventory management
in the game is it i'm giving myself some
some credit for that one yeah don't
sweat it like here's the deal like
pac-man
99 we're gonna play it if they wanted it
to be played on the first
show after it came out uh they shouldn't
have like stealth announced it
they know what they did because i i plan
some of this stuff especially with other
people i plan it like well in advance
so like we already had the thursday
rainbow six stuff set up like
oh frick a while ago
and then like you know i gotta play
isaac
because i love it and so do a lot of
other people but
saved and then on uh
um f
on friday we got the overcooked
tournament of champions
god he's good uh on friday we've got the
overcooked tournament of champions
and i also need to still like play some
isaac so i mean
on half of a heart it does that maybe or
maybe that's something to do with the
weird hitbox i don't know um
so again like if pac-man kind of gets
pushed a little bit here's what i'll say
though
we're gonna play it for sure i played a
little bit
um
on the couch last night
and i think it's fun right now i think
it lacks
uh some of the the pageantry of
pac-man 99 or of uh tetris 99
but i also think that how could i know
yet right
because i haven't played enough of it to
really have a strong opinion
i think it's it's fun like i was having
fun with it and starting to come up with
strategies
but i got a lot to learn let's put it
that way i got a lot to learn
yeah do it
compost no thank you
my merch showed up in the wrong size who
do i contact
you should at glass embroidery on
twitter
probably twitter is not the preferred
platform but
i will use my content creator resin to
get over that
f
i'm i'm digging the tears and all that
i but i wish like the foot would come
down yeah yeah yeah
i get bodied
get bodied again
i mean when we get the polaroid here
it's all over for you
when you see my body after summer
vacation you're all gonna be sorry you
call me chubby
get ready
you'll see who's chubby ashley
you'll all see
we're living yeah isaac i get it isaac
get some new material oh
all right well i'm gonna go to the bath



to try to get tainted as hazel yet again
we'll do our best and uh hold on i have
i have some
some messages on the old discord
i got dan sending me investment advice
now
we're both we're we're
i was going to say balls deep and boggle
[Laughter]
but it's not because that's a real
person that's not the way i want to
phrase it
all right sorry youtube sorry um okay
yeah so we got azel but don't take lil
baggy this time
that's the ticket
okay i don't mind undefined i always
knew nl was a bogle head
i you know there was i read all the
books on
stock picking and uh
i think i understand it i think if you
have an infinite amount of time
you could do a great job with it maybe
but if you don't have an infinite amount
of time it seems like you should just
really buy
you know like vti and and maybe some
bonds and then
you know just go like see your family
instead of looking at balance sheets all
the time
anyway that's that's that's my
investment bit for today
my two cents it's a little different in
canada because we we have like different
versions of the vanguard funds and stuff
like that but
next bit yo dude
hiko that's i've never seen it called a
cross rock before
that's a you know we could we could use
that
no long because tinted and tainted i get
confused now we could be
you know we could change up our
vernacular a little bit
i bought heavily into an esports
gambling ipo
later this week i believe in the twitch
chat gambling addiction
oh no is that i and i don't i don't
follow the
like new issues and stuff like that but
is that i've been seeing all this post
about like
this company called skills is that what
it is
i'm like in the exact opposite boat like
i don't i mean look you're gonna you're
gonna turn me into like a
a bad guy here i have nothing against
esports but i don't believe in them
as like a business and i could be wrong
which is i'm not like
anti-esports i'm just staying away
i was just thinking about whether i was
gonna do alt path
so like uh like sports gambling i you
know i don't i don't buy individual
stocks really anymore but
with some i believe in that i believe
that and the you know
america and canada are getting more
permissive about allowing sports
gambling
like i i believe in those 100 percent
but i've seen some companies that are
like we're going to make it so you can
like
you know bet real money on the overwatch
league and i'm like
like eight people are gonna do that
that's just again i just don't i don't
consider this financial advice that's
just in my head i can't imagine a world
where people are like i put ten thousand
dollars on
team dignitas but i they've been wrong
about a great many things before
but i will say on the flip side
i did buy into uh an etf
which is just a fund that tracks a
sector um
that follows the gaming industry and my
entire philosophy
like my the the only investment thesis
and evidence i have for it
is whenever i accidentally get to uh the
front page of reddit
being logged out 90 of the posts i see
are about mobile gotcha games
and i'm like these
people they're putting their life
savings into this stuff
and i guess i want to slice
some companies have a ticker for who's
gonna win
in space jam too that's pretty sick
what's going on with your active i i
forgot to use it
that's about it yeah i feel like i would
i would put the smart money on lebron
but could you imagine um oh hello sir
victor by the way hello
can you imagine if you were in the
theater watching space jam 2
and it appeared that the monstars were
going to win and there was like some
sweaty middle-aged guy behind you being
like no
i bet on you know
i thought wreck-it ralph was gonna hit
six three-pointers this game he's at
four i'm not even covering the spread
right now
that is that is great the the idea of
somebody
gambling on the outcome of a movie
this is how i win we could hold the fool
but who
who freaking cares man uncut jams it's
perfect
it's perfect
no thank you i had the over on lola
bunny free throws
that's that's a good bet you know she's
she's got solid fundamentals
lola bunny probably is gonna get the
most assists on the team that's
that's my take
excuse me
she's got hops you appear to be confused
with zootopia
very different movie
take a range though
use the fn item we don't say the f word
here okay the only f word we say here
is friendship and
fixed income occasionally you'll hear me
say frick but
rest assured i hit confessional up
afterwards
i have a lot of questions about
confessional okay
because i and we've been through this a
few times i know essentially nothing
about
any organized religion okay
if you confess to a murderer
to your priest in confession
is the priest obligated to report that
to the cops
just like thought experiments here he's
he's obligated
really so i don't like the same thing
like
what about like if you confess a murder
to like a therapist
or like your lawyer or something like
that right
there's a there's attorney client
privilege and like doctor client
privilege doctor patient confidentiality
i should say
therapists would have to report it
lawyer wouldn't
i'm not trying to like you know i don't
have anything to get off my chest
i'm just saying like where do they exist
in in the therapist versus lawyer versus
priest
uh continuum right
now okay if
a ceo of a company
gives insider information to a priest
can the priest trade on the information
without it being insider trading
[Laughter]
what if the inside information is that
the ceo
had killed their competitor
you see what i'm getting at here i think
we found a loophole
drop trinket thank you thank you
so is am i am i there's no
there's no priest
client privilege
is that correct
there is
there's clergy privilege
priests are not supposed to report
crimes what do you mean when you say
supposed to
like in the bible they're like you don't
have to or like
the law is like you don't have to or is
the law like
you can't which is another thing
altogether dude we're freaking going
we're going all the way on this one okay
hold on the r key is insane this is
gonna be an absurd run
i can't do alt path i could do all path
on the next one
okay here's what we're gonna do okay
we're gonna go
the back way we're going to go home
we're going to unlock tainted as hazel
we're going to use the r key and then
we're going to go back down the alt path
that's the ticket so we'll be we'll be
holding the space bar item for a long
time
prepare yourself and we're going home on
this one so this is fine
yes okay okay
they're held to the same standards as
doctors see that's why like i'm not
saying they shouldn't be
i mean it seems like you know being in
an industry where you rely on
people disclosing their private sins
like you would have to have some kind of
protection as the person receiving those
legally speaking
i mean it's an industry you can be mad
if you want
he's not doing it for free if he's doing
it for free i'd be even more freaked out
you get some good gossip i guess
our key doesn't work in home edmond come
on man like
okay well we can't go alt path
so i mean we can do home last the only
thing is like
you know why would we do home last
because the only other thing we can do
is the alt path
can we do no you can't do alt path and
then go home
i don't know man i think i think we'll
we'll stick with the greed strat we'll
use it after mom
and just get a super strong run
we can't we can't really do alt path
first we don't have a
we didn't get the first knife piece
do it anyway that's a spirit
um if you get mom's knife or
sharp key you can do the alt path okay
oh okay now we're talking if you get
mom's key
mom's knife i should say or the alt path
mom's knife does not work okay you know
what we're going back to the priests
discussion
sharp key sharp key okay
could happen after using our key dad's
note won't spawn either
that can't be true i i disbelieve that
part the wiki is wrong
the limit does not exist
priests are not supposed to snitch all
right
because i mean honestly like first off
there's like the moral
problem like if somebody confessed to a
crime
i guess you're not the law right like on
us on a citizen level
you might feel like you have an
obligation to like report it
but you're also like you know you're not
a cop you're just there to like take
after their soul right like shepherd
their soul to whatever salvation they
can get
but then um i also feel like that'd be
really
annoying like that'd be an annoying part
of being a priest if they didn't have
that right
like if they were if if somebody was
like they reported they confessed like
oh i stole
like uh ten thousand dollars from my
place of work or something like that the
priest is like oh great
now after work i gotta go down to the
police station
it's probably gonna take me you know
hours and hours to
go report this to the cops and then
they're gonna be like you got any proof
and i'd be like
source dude just trust me she said it in
the confession booth
anyway justin it's in just an
interesting uh
just an interesting kind of industry to
me
what if the priest was also a cop
it's a good question
seems like kind of a conflict of
interest right
although before the cop
murdered someone they could at least
give them their last rights to ensure
that they go to heaven
so that would you know iron out one of
the kind of
institutional inefficiencies there i
suppose
priest cobb
okay hold on hold on
are they doing like virtual confessions
now
because of covid like do you have to
call in like
you know scramble your name
or put your name in wingdings or
something your little father
did they could see like your family
photos behind you
and stuff like that your kids are like
running around in the background james
is that you
no okay
yeah yeah yeah send it send it
send it yeah yeah so we're gonna fight
mom
and then we're gonna use r and we're
gonna try to use r
on the boss rush yeah okay he's got it
he's got it
okay he's he's got it all figured out
man
don't priests generally know who's
confessing come on man
there's uh a wide lattice
between one booth and the other how
could they possibly know
there's like a little checkerboard of uh
of pine how could they possibly figure
it out
it's like superman's secret identity as
soon as you put
glasses on him he's invisible
confessions pretty wild
i've never like the the only on an
individual level the only religious
experience i have there's like a few
i was baptized when i was too young to
remember and never confirmed
so like as far as i understand it like
god's pretty ticked off because my
soul's still like on the books right
like it's still in accounts receivable
the funds have not settled yet
and then
i got tricked into going to bible camp
for like a few days when i was in
maybe seventh grade because i think my
parents
just wanted me like out of the house for
a bit over summer vacation
and my neighbor who had a kid the same
age was like oh yeah he loves camp
so like i went to camp and then all of a
sudden you know you watch
george of the jungle in the morning and
then they start sitting down and talking
to you about like
you know kane and abel and stuff like
that and you're like wait a minute
this doesn't seem like a normal summer
camp
[Laughter]
and yeah it's basically just daycare
i'm trying to think of what out that's
like that's it man i think that's it
i've been to some weddings at churches
like maybe
maybe like five weddings in my life and
that's
that's all i got
i'm racking my brain right now
oh you know what i've been to a lot of
like music recitals for
like kate and kate's parents ed
at uh at churches i you know what now
i'm realizing there is one more
so there's a really uh it's like one of
the two most important holidays
in the korean calendar it's called
chuseok
it's basically analogous to like a
korean thanksgiving
you you get together you eat a huge meal
that
takes a lot of preparation um
everybody more or less in the country
like travels back to wherever their
relatives live it's it's a big deal so i
went over to kate's parents house for
chuseok this is only like a couple years
ago
and it was like it's not their fault
they were being very accommodating but
it was so awkward for me because like
you know we we like knelt in front of
pictures of
like kate's parents parents who
i don't know died in like the 1980s
maybe
and then they pulled out like a bunch of
bibles and just started like singing and
they were singing in english because
like
i was there which they did not have to
do because i didn't know any of the
songs so i was just sitting there
awkwardly like
i wish i could help but i'll do mod
thank you
thank you for the the gifted subs
appreciate it thank you
sure why not
it's just kind of uncomfortable for me
it's not again it's their holiday right
like i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna impose but i was like
don't sing it in english on my behalf i
don't know
i don't believe in this stuff come on
because of those subs you have to answer
if modest mouse is
overrated or just rated well hold on
thank you to the danger zone as well
thank you um
so the only options are overrated or or
rated properly
um that's tough for me i i don't really
know
how well they're rated to begin with
i think i thought most people were on
the same page where they like
you know the stuff they did basically up
to good news for people who love bad
news
is really good and then after that they
fell off
but i i guess if you're gonna push me i
would i would say
that they're probably a little overrated
because i
really basically do not like anything
that they've done since 2006 or 2007.
um
and i know that there's people that like
love that so i would say overrated
[Laughter]
but i do i listen to to some modest
mouse for sure
it's just the older stuff
you know we've thought about this
question before like if kate confessed
the crime to you
would you report it it would depend on
the situation
you know
i wouldn't 100 say no i wouldn't 100
say yes but i would probably lean
towards no
it depends on what it was you know
if she like hit somebody with the car
and was like i just kind of
like pushed them into the ditch and then
drove off
i would be like we should really call
that one in because they're gonna find
the body
and you're gonna be in way more trouble
that's one you wanna like let's let's
just go in together on that one
but if she came home and she was like
you know check it out i like shoplifted
a
dvd or something like that i'd be like
whoa
i'm not gonna report you but that's a
little out of character
you want to like talk to somebody about
it
movie night hey okay can you go back and
steal some
some popcorn
hey tinted skull by the way
oh they didn't have any uh any comedies
you could steal
what if she confessed to capital
punishment um
no what if she confessed i got the bit
wrong what if she confessed to
jaywalking
capital punishment
what if she confessed the capital
punishment very simple jaywalking
oh man we're too late to get into boss
rush i'm a fool
and now i hold the fool but we don't
even need the fool card because we're
just getting out of here anyway okay
saved saved
this is from chad not from me by the way
i used to shoplift
when i was younger wasn't that great to
be honest
i'm look i'm look you make a mistake
when you're like
14 you're older now what do i care but i
am always surprised when people
like i've heard people say like oh you
know everybody has like a little
shoplifting phase like everybody's
stolen something once right and i'm like
nah i mean
i stole a grape from the grocery store
one time
but uh apart from that
i mean i was like three but
um our key yeah yeah do it do it
put them in 25 to life buddy no
because i stole it from a priest so
i i mean you gotta quantify the
difference right
because gabo the babo thank you
look at the gifted subs thank you um
people are saying like you never stole
anything from a self checkout
i did um and this wasn't even a self
checkout this is from like the real
checkout one time this was like less
than
five years ago i just forgot that i had
a bunch of stuff on the bottom of my
cart
and then just [__] walked out man
like i i put unloaded the top of the
cart onto the belt
and then the bottom of the cart uh
i just forgot it was there there was
like hard shell taco shells and stuff
down there and i just i i just
you know i only noticed when i was
loading that stuff into the into the
trunk and i was like
i'm not going back up there are you
crazy and then i i'll just never go back
to that grocery store ever again
but no at a self checkout i've i've
never done
um i've never just failed to scan
something
but i will okay chad's keeping me honest
i guess you know it's
it's a it's a form of theft
when at in my first year of university
when i used to
get the most expensive sandwich
at the canteen and then when i went up
to pay for it because it was all wrapped
up i would just tell
the cashier that it was uh
a hummus sandwich which is like 350
and the the actually good sandwiches
were like five bucks so
and i don't know if you would classify
this as theft
but every time i went down i would also
grab like a handful of those like single
serving um premium plus crackers
that were only there for soup but like
there's there was no rule at the time
that was like these are only for soup
it was like you know
here they are like the way i see it
like if you go into like a starbucks
and maybe they got like sugar packets or
something there no matter what you buy
if you want to take a couple of sugar
packets i'm not going to be
i'm not going to be upset with you you
know why should somebody else have the
ability to get some
sugar packets and then just because you
got green tea you're like screwed right
seems pretty unfair
there's some stuff i mean everybody has
their limit right
like i know that there's probably people
in this chat that like every time they
go to the
hotel they steal towels that's crazy
like like a towel is like a real thing
a sugar pack is like you know it's like
a
three cents or something like that
but i was i will say
um the last time my parents were here
every time they went down to the
breakfast buffet at their hotel they
took like a little
cereal box full of muesli every time to
take back to their room
and then they uh they never ended up
eating it so they just gifted me like
16 or 20 single serving muesli boxes and
i was like this owns
i also i don't feel like it's
stealing in some situations
if you go into uh and
i'm being half serious with this take
there's my
my take on this i'm being half serious
with this
if you're in a place of business where
you're paying a fee
and then there's like some discretionary
items that are also
around that's part of the game
you and that business are in like a
tango together
to try to up your margins you know
whatever
up each other's margins i should say
like if you're
at a buffet and you're not hungry
but you keep eating that's not stealing
right
no one would ever suggest that that's
stealing
so what if you you go up to the
buffet but and right before you're about
to leave you shove a little bit of
orange chicken inside of your inside
pocket and your jacket
is inside of your your sport coat no no
i can't go alt path because i'm
unlocking
tainted as hazel here i'm going to try
at least
we're we're going to go for that tanner
zaisel get
we do need to leave a trinket though so
what if you put some orange chicken in
your
in your pocket or something like that
you know what i mean
i mean what's the difference between
smuggling it out in your pocket and then
eating it later or
smuggling it out in your belly it's the
same difference
you know the restaurant would have the
it's the same breakage either way
i'm just saying
it's the same thing like i mean if
you're a subway
and you like use
tactics you learned from the art of the
deal to convince the worker to put on
more olives than they're supposed to put
onto one sandwich without having to
charge you for extra olives
that's not stealing they're making a
profit on you
you get the you're you're trying to claw
back as much as you can
you know
when we go to uh you know like get our
cars oil changed or something like that
they have you know keurig k-cups and
stuff like that sometimes i'll be like
over-caffeinated
i'll have like five or six cups of
coffee because i'm like
you know you're charging me for this oil
change i know this isn't worth like
you know 70 bucks
so i'll just drink like a couple of
liters of coffee inside your waiting
room
that'll show you
i'll show all of you that's
there there's a diff there's some
stealing and then there's there's
there's business as well there's
stealing and then there's business
business is really just theft with like
a contract behind it
in in many ways if you don't subject
that to any kind of intellectual
analysis
i stand by the premium plus i know that
they're put there for the soups
but at the same time just because you
order a soup it means you get some free
crackers
screw you maybe i'll get a couple of
premium plus crackers i'll put them on
my
hummus sandwich
why should the soup eaters get all the
all the privilege you know
why shouldn't i take it
they're factored into the price of the
soup i don't know i would put that
theory to the test
i i would like to see their their
itemized financials
don't don't do that i am not the type of
guy to not put the card away
i have i've talked about shopping card
theory before
i always put my card back i will also
put back
one cart that is on the way
that somebody didn't put back
probably not two and i won't go if if
if the parking lot is like chock full of
you know extra carts
i'm not going around to get all of them
but i will do my part and then i'll also
add
a plus one increment onto that for
for anybody else that needs it but
i'm i'm not going to say i'm a saint
that i'm cleaning the parking lot but i
always put mine back
pardon me um we need to trinket dude
dude where's my trinket
i should just diplopia should have
should have done that
ages ago um
i forgot what else i was talking about
what was i talking about
oh cart theory yeah i mean i the movie
theater
i've done it at the movie theater too i
think it's a little bit more saintly i'm
not asking for like the nobel prize in
mathematics or whatever that's a call
back by the way in case you're confused
because these episodes come out a little
different on youtube but like
in um in the movie theater like
sometimes you'll be sitting next to
people and they'll leave their garbage
in their seats
now and then i have been known to maybe
take my garbage to the garbage can
and also take their garbage to the
garbage can
i'm not gonna go through the whole you
know
row and pick up everybody's garbage can
or everybody's garbage but
you know if the people were sitting next
to me then i'll do it
it's too gross for me
come on it's like the outside of a soda
cup
now i probably wouldn't do it but back
then
sure yeah
don't you come on chad
over the past literally like this time
two years ago i was like you should wash
your hands when you go to the bathroom
people were like screw you
you don't know what the hell you're
talking about now i'm like yeah
sometimes i'll take a stranger's garbage
the garbage can
they're like are you insane do you want
to get the bubonic plague
i mean the world has changed to be fair
but i mean the movie theaters also
aren't open so
it's mostly a hypothetical right now
let's go it's a good trinket it sucks to
lose but let's go
oh we need an item room as well
dude also i mean this is like this is
more like rat life anecdotes but we used
to go to trivia night at this bar
in university and like usually
there was like the after like the happy
hour crowd was just
leaving as the trivia night crowd showed
up sometimes they'd leave like their
nacho plate when they left that
had all the stuff they didn't want to
eat and we would just
like me and my friend would just walk
around and be like yo look at this this
they left like all the all the olives
and we would just like eat handfuls of
olives off of their plate
when they were gone not like
while they were coming back like while
they were just in the bathroom or
something
i did the same thing yeah dude they're
good olives man
nothing wrong with those olives
is that stealing they were just gonna
put them in the compost anyway
what if they tried them decided they
were gross so they spit them out
um i i live by a very simple
principle when it comes to food in this
sense
if i don't know it can't hurt me
mostly like i i'm sure that there have
been situations where i probably ate
some messed up stuff from a restaurant
you know i you're not gonna believe me
but like i treat waiters and waitresses
with respect i'm not in the business of
like
you know being an a-hole so i don't
think that i would ever give somebody
like a vindictive reason to spit in my
food or whatever
but i'm sure that you know given the
amount of restaurant meals that i've
eaten
i've eaten stuff that maybe it was
messed with
maybe it fell on the ground and they
were like oh he's already been waiting
15 minutes just
you know send it out there anyway i'm
sure it's happened
if they came out and we're like hey like
you know your pizza fell on the ground
are you sure
you still want to eat that i'd be like
no i'm leaving
um but if they didn't tell me
i'm like it's delicious man this is the
best pizza i've ever eaten
so it's the same with the olives if they
ate them and spit them out
as long as i never find out then life's
good now i wouldn't do it now
but when i was like 19 i was like dude
olives are they're pricey
that's a pricey food i still don't buy
olives
they're expensive
what about hair in your food i don't
know how this works let's do it though
honestly like hair in my food doesn't
really bother me
if it looked like somebody had shaved on
top of my food
i would be upset but whenever i see like
one hair or something i'm always and
it's incredible i'm i just pull the hair
off and i'm like you know
s happens man
i don't i can't expect you to have 100
percent
control of like every single one of your
500
000 little hairs up there like that's
crazy
i just get over it
what about the feeling of it in your
mouth there's been many times where i
like bitten into something and then like
there's a hair and i'm grossed out for
like
i don't know like four seconds and then
i just go back to eden
i guess not everybody's in the same boat
here i'm not trying to say like if you
disagree like you're
wrong it is kind of gross but isn't it
the grossness that i feel is way
lower than the amount of deliciousness i
get out of the food
if i saw like three or four hairs in the
same dish though i would be like
i'm not eating this like something went
wrong
i found a staple in my curry once i spit
it out and kept eating
i mean like i i hear you i've never done
that
i would probably at least give the
restaurant like a call or something like
that
but i would probably also eat the rest
of the meal i think
i don't know just that i'm like if
anything
my brain's so messed up that i think
like once i
had the staple i would be like well
i'm super safe now because there's no
way there's two staples in this thing
like i would i would feel so protected
after that what are the chances
uh who ordered the the office supply
curry
oh that was me
anyway i don't get too grossed out by
food
like food safety stuff my
my philosophy is if i don't see it and i
don't get sick then
on i'm just gonna be real with you and
this is coming from a place of genuine
sincerity
if they drop let's posit a world in
which
like i am omniscient okay
i would rather if they drop my food on
the ground for a second
i would rather they pick it up and serve
me and don't tell me
then remake it i would rather they just
brought it out as quickly as possible
alabaster box
like i i would rather as long as i don't
know
like let's let's say you put me in the
in the position of not knowing
but i'm making the choice in advance
if someone if you told me it fell on the
floor i would be like no please do not
serve me that but if you're like if you
had me fill out
like an organ donor card or something
like that
and you were like i give you permission
if my food fell on the floor for like
less than three seconds to just serve it
to me
i would sign it i would sincerely
i'm being i'm being 100 sincere i'm not
saying you have to join me on this
bizarre take
okay not a soup a soup i would like
another one but they already had the
soup made so that like i'm talking about
something that takes a little bit more
time to cook
also if it fell on the carpet no thank
you
um how do you charge oh it charges on
spirit hearts
how about that look at that charges on
spirit hearts
okay we don't need the tinted skull we
already have
the full card in fact we have it two
times
how about that going in
i kind of operate on the principle that
you know obviously germs exist
but i think i i mean you're gonna it's
gonna get me in a little trouble here
for sure
um i want to preface this by doing that
i think that
food safety standards are like a good
thing
for sure like a i think they're they're
great love them
however i think if you forced my hand
and you said are they
too strict or too lenient
i would probably say that they're a
little too strict
the standards that i adhere to in my
home kitchen
are substantially lower than those in a
restaurant and i don't know if i've ever
gotten sick from home cooking
horrible take i don't know i i welcome
the
the opposing viewpoint
but you're gonna have to not type so
fast
because i can't
i can't read it all i do agree it's best
to over correct
it's better to have standards that are
too uh
that are stricter than standards that
are lenient when it comes to people's
health
no question about it but then there's a
like sometimes i'll look through like
the vancouver health department
whenever they give a citation to a
restaurant
um it it's public information they
release like a report
that you can just download that has like
you know what was shut down and like why
it was shut down
and like i look at it every couple of
months
and i'm like man i love that place i had
no idea they had a
rat infestation and never washed their
dishes in warm water
still as soon as they reopen i think i'm
ready to go back in i'll be first in
line
i don't know i don't think it's a bad
take i think it's just like a realistic
take
like i i think like most
restaurants like what are you supposed
to do
about stopping like a rat infestation
they're rats man like that you know you
live in a city
they show up everywhere sometimes it'll
just be walking around
it'll be like a rat will like scurry
into a bush or something like that
it's just city living baby
it's true dank i appreciate that
i mean you've see they made a whole
movie about it it's called ratatouille
maybe you've heard of it what the
neptunis
did daniel invent this
[Laughter]
the heck is neptunis
it is the first time i've i've had a
planetarium though
i've lived in a city for 21 years i've
never seen a rat
i i was like you once and you know what
my problem was
i was not very perceptive
okay if you vibe hard enough
the feelings can't get to you
no rats here where do you do you live
where
st patrick lived i can't remember yeah
why would you take a little walk around
at night that's where i see him man
scurrying and like there's scurry in
between like you know in the alleys
where
like restaurants are i'm not saying like
yo
poggy a rat i'm more just like you know
i understand it's kind of a
it's a hard thing to ensure that you
have like no rats
near your kitchen you're thinking of
snakes
i'd prefer if possible
to not have
snakes in the kitchen mostly for the
safety
of the um of the
of the staff
yeah really most animals i would prefer
to not be in the kitchen to begin with
don't get me
wrong including rats i'm just saying you
know
it's kind of hard to i don't know maybe
maybe i'm like anti-naive maybe i'm like
i'm i'm too grizzled i'm like a like a
beat cop from new york in the 1970s but
i'm like hey rats murder what are you
gonna do
there are some things that like when i
read the health report i'm like
this is pretty bad like when i see some
sometimes restaurants get shut down and
it's like uh no hot water
and i'm like yeah that's that's pretty
bad that's a bad one
when it's like past infestation i'm like
yeah you know
it happens
i guess the way i look at it is like i
see so many restaurants
get shut down well like
for like a week for uh pest infestations
nice places cheap places you know
all neighborhoods that instead of
thinking like oh man those must be like
bad restaurant owners
the only conclusion i can come to is
like all rats
all restaurants in the city have rats
and it's just a matter of like whether
or not
the health department came to visit you
that day
that's why like there's some times when
on kitchen nightmares where i'm like oh
come on gordon
there's never there's never been a a
mouse inside of a
of a gordon ramsay kitchen i don't think
so
i'd be surprised
hog
you're paying for a standard though i
don't know like
what what percentage of a restaurant's
uh fee
is protection from rats existing
in the kitchen i mostly look at it as
like an ingredients thing
yeah dude that's the thing like we have
a friend who works at the grocery store
and he told us like yeah there's mice in
the grocery store like now and then
just happens they do like mice
you know evolutionarily they
they do a great job of sneaking into
things that
are food and and not getting caught
i've i've preferred to take the stance i
suppose that i i co-exist with the with
the rodentia
and maybe on a personal level i think if
you're like
i don't i prefer a kitchen without rats
in it
i'm like yeah but me too don't get me
wrong but i think you're living in a
little bit of a fantasy world
but i do i wonder what percentage of
like
kitchens have rats in them and then when
the meal comes out there's like a kid at
the table that's like
oh i can't let the potatoes and the peas
touch
that'll be a good bid
where'd the key go check it out look at
it it's hiding behind the whole the the
full card
look at this neptunis gives everyone
a fire rate bonus except for his easel
ah
i was wondering
alberta has no rats that is actually
pretty sick
uh excuse me um you forgot about um
matthew kachuk
he's a hockey player got him
anyway no the so the the red room that
you see back there
you can access the the twin peaks
dimension
by using the cracked key but in all
likelihood
based on my experience with another
similar item in this game
um it will be a room with enemies in it
and then you'll have wasted your
cracked key in the first place and
you'll
be sad
i believe dude we got to play some
pac-man after this
i can't believe this is the last isaac i
always
err on the side of uh
like too much isaac instead of too
little because the one time i did like
i think it was only like two hours and i
was like this is not enough man
oh excuse me excuse me you unlocked his
easel
i could never handle rats walking next
to me at a restaurant
okay i mean like that's a different
story i'm not trying to say like it's
rational
there's a difference for me between
logically
assuming that the kitchen might have
rats in it
not like scampering around but you know
like living in the walls and coming out
to steal a little cheese maybe cook a
couple of meals from time to time
maybe make uh a food critic like
you know rethink everything he thought
about his attitude or something like
that
if they were like running free in the
restaurant i would be like we gotta go
and i would probably lower my tip as
well
but at first i'd be like can we get a
little box
for the rest of this i'm going to go
ahead and eat the rest of this food
in a rat less environment
yeah a little box we're gonna take the
rats home with us
that would be a good joke if you saw a
rat
in the dining room you could be like hey
what's the chef doing out here shouldn't
you be back in the kitchen
my um bon appetit my compliments to the
chef
hey plus you gotta hand it to him
he married for she married him for love
she loves money
squam squammy heavy squam
energy okay
all right yo bumbo he's like next level
man
i can't i can't hit you i can hit you
bumbo has obtained flight now you're all
gonna pay
i will say though it is fair to say like
first off i've never worked in a
restaurant but
it's always easier like the burden of
proof is different
like if you've worked in a restaurant
and you have a horror story
that carries a lot of weight in people's
minds right you can't work at a
restaurant and be like
uh i worked at a restaurant and there
were no rats people would be like wow
that's a nice restaurant
but if you work at a restaurant and
you're like oh the chef diarrhea into
the chili
they'd be like oh i'm never eating chili
anywhere ever again
but i will say i always
enjoy hearing restaurant horror stories
even for places that like i like to
visit
i just feel like it it makes me a more
informed consumer
like math has told me at applebee's
like everything is cooked in a bag
like that that comes in from like cisco
food services or whatever and it's all
microwaved
i've never eaten an applebee's but like
honestly that wouldn't stop me
there's got to be something to it if
it's still around
but i would if you have restaurant
horror stories i'd love to hear them
if you can legally share them
doesn't bother me at all
the tim hortons ice caps get poured from
a bucket into a machine
you know so so it's not like a iced
cappuccino
then with like some syrup or something
it's like it comes in a mix that's then
poured into like a milkshake machine
by the way i've been informed apparently
i was mistaken and they no longer use
the
uh the pink slime for chicken nuggets
they use all white meat now which i
think i learned at one point and then
just forgot
i have seen as well like
photos from the taco bell kitchen where
like all the
like the beans come in in these bags and
it's like dehydrated bean sand that they
heat
up in like a hot water bath honestly
wouldn't stop me i'm like i mean you
know what you're getting you're getting
four tacos for like two bucks
yeah but it slaps yeah exactly i mean
i've never eaten there but it wouldn't
stop me
yeah bumbo's doing some good work
yeah i'm sure there's some gross stuff
that like
lots of restaurants i i go to
what's happening no i i don't know if
i've ever had like this little hurting
power i don't think i've ever seen these
these attacks
i work at a mcdonald's and a dude dunked
his balls in the magic shell chocolate
all right so two things
he's a menace he should be in prison
there's uh
that's un unconscionable secondly
i wonder what it felt like i bet it felt
kind of cool
especially when you like you know when
it hardened and then you could like peel
it off
i bet that felt kind of sick
get toasted
[Laughter]
wouldn't that be weird remember when
there was a tick tock going around that
was like
down into the you're testicles are
connected to your taste buds so if you
dip your balls in soy sauce it tastes
like
soybeans and then all the videos
isaac ascendant nobody in the videos
ever
uh was like it works they or like they
would i could never trust them they
would like do it and then they'd be like
what and i was like is this the joke
there's no way this works man
i do not believe that this works
anyway um let's run some ads and then
i'll come back and play
uh an hour pacman99 if i run some ads i
mean
i'm not running ads just follow me uh
we're almost at 420 000



you for the gifted subscriptions thank
you all right
we're back we're going for tainted as
hazel also known as tinted as hazel also
known as tinted as
azel you know i never had a choice
i was gonna say they don't have the they
don't have the you know whats
to give me a uh a range downgrade
as a zazel they gave me like a little
like lip service they're like a little
slap on the wrist
i'm above the law what were we talking
about oh yeah like a pill that makes you
hungry right before you eat i'm telling
you
it would be a hit is it a little
dystopian that you know while we live in
a world
where people are still like dying of
starvation
people in the capital city of ponem
are taking a pill that makes them hungry
right before they eat unnecessarily just
to increase their satisfaction
maybe i suppose
would it get the people going yes and
in in some ways that's what really
matters
why not just wait come on man that's
like with with
rogaine you're going to be like why not
just grow more hair it's that's not how
it works okay where
did modern medicine
has accomplished some amazing things and
one of those amazing things
is just uh letting you take the easy way
out
like they already have meals in pill
form
what about making a pill that makes our
meals that much tastier
what about a pill that makes your hair
grow back
they have that pill it's called uh wigs
don't try to take a shot at me man
about a pill that makes your heart sing
if your heart sings for more than four
hours please call this number
yeah i'll take it i'm like dude i don't
know what to say on a run where i'm just
being a zazel
like i'm so used to
having to use literally 110 of my brain
power like i'm using brain on margin
right now
and when i get freaking margin called i
don't know you
i mean that's where you end up with
those videos where i'm just going like
number one baby woo yeah bacon egg and
cheese baby yeah monday baby freaking
baby ooh
papa ooh baby like over and over so
we gotta i i'm didn't get hit
i'm not used to to being able to kind of
just
chill you know what i mean like this is
very like low danger
what the heck is going on here all right
that seems like
actually really bad let's see if we can
get a
uh a trinket
that we can drop up here
is actually game-winning i've decided
that when i said it was bad what i meant
was
is actually game-winning
and you may have misheard what i said
earlier
you see that there this is i i think we
had a real moment i talk about this a
lot
i think we had a real moment this
weekend where a lot of gamers realize
they're old
and the moment was when sony announced
that they were gonna remake
uh remaster the last of us and people
are like what the heck that game only
came out like
four years ago but it actually came out
eight years ago
that's a long time in the world of games
i mean like what was the gap between
it obviously it's longer what was the
gap between
demon souls 1 and the demon souls
remastered
it's like 12 years that's only 50
percent longer
11 years yeah i mean it's only 50
percent longer i mean that's kind of a
lot but
this is a good point yeah okay you know
i think i've accidentally proved the
opposite of my point but still
only 50 50 is a lot boy i'd hate to see
your
transcripts
i guess it is the second remaster
it's a trinket that's exactly what we
wanted
it is crazy to think about yeah like the
the game boy advance came out
19 years ago
that's a long time ago i'm trying to
think of what else like
i started to see things i remember being
like
maybe 15 or 16 and having the
realization
that like wow i actually have like
distinctive
memories of things that happened like a
decade ago
that's crazy and now there's i'm seeing
things like movies i saw
in the theater like their studio is
posting tweets like
25th anniversary of the addams family
and i'm like 25th anniversary
that's not possible as i saw it in
theaters and i'm only 23 years old
so how could that and then it's you know
you start to do the math and you're like
no actually that's right
[Laughter]
you got me on that one
endless nameless my hat is like a
shark's fin
yeah when the last of us came out my
parents were still married
yikes it's dignity luanne
i don't want buddy in a box i don't
believe it
yeah i mean i know it's just how time
works but you know when you
when you're super young like you know
when you're when you're still in school
even even up to university you know life
moves pretty quick like you constantly
get new signposts so you're always
very aware of your age you're also
surrounded by people that are
you know mostly your age or within a
couple of years of you at the very least
then when you get older you kind of lose
that attachment to constantly thinking
about your age and you just wake up one
day and you're like what the heck
i'm like 70. i'm 99 years old i'm a
billion
i'm methuselah from the old testament
how did that happen
like this i i'm now more than 10 years
out of university which is crazy
because i also just started it two weeks
ago
come off it man quit being methuselah no
methuselah is awesome dude
might you why'd you grow a beard like
methuselah i just like them
i'm not old no i'm just saying i'm i'm
aging
everyone's a i i again i say it more
like not to be like oh i'm gonna be dead
soon because again like i know how this
sounds
like and people are gonna be like don't
care didn't ask plus he's a colonizer
but like when prince philip died i was
actually like
the distance between my age and prince
philip's
age when he died is more than two times
the amount
i've lived on planet earth which is just
staggering because i feel like i've
lived
a long time however
we dropped the trinket already we
dropped it on the last floor right
um yeah yeah
however i'm also like man that's like
it's a long time
99 years but i like to
remind the people in chat about their
age because they always make fun of me
for being old but that's just because
many of them started watching when they
were like 19 and they're like i'm gonna
be 19 forever
and now they're like 24 and they're like
uh i'm so
old and then i like to really freaking
twist the thumb screws on him
that's the uh that's basically the
spirit of this bit
is the people that made fun of me for
being old when i was not old
just because they thought they could
make fun of me forever because they were
a little younger now it's time to
like you know really make them feel the
burn it's pretty much what it's coming
down to
plus i think like the right time to
complain
about being old is when you're young
because nobody wants to hear like a 90
year old complaining about being old
it's just sad
it's just like uh
all my friends have like slipped into
the afterlife that you know
when when someone in their 30s is like
oh you know i
my back hurts more than it did five
years ago you can be like ah that's
you know you know that is what it is
someone's like you know
oh you know my the last guy from my
world war
ii platoon died today you're like oh
grandpa like
i'm sorry
no one wants to hear a 30 year old
complain about being old either
well um i got the stream dashboard
open right now and i just got to say
like i i think i beg to differ
i think we're gonna have to agree to
disagree on that one
me and 10 195 of my closest friends
share a dissenting opinion
i believe you but my tommy gun don't by
the way people
have been yeah ratio don't care didn't
ask plus your ratio
range up okay that's that's useful um
i know people have been following the
saga of my broken toe
that may or may not actually be broken
nobody knows myself included
um it still hurts but in
a different way and back to you
like it used it hurt in like a like a
a sharp way and now it kind of hurts in
like a dull way
but i think that means it's healing it
also if it felt like the inside of my
foot was like a little itchy
and i think that's like the universal
sign for
uh healing is when when something starts
to itch a little bit
either that or it's deeply infectious
um small rock baby
okay now this seems pretty cool
my arm still hurts from getting the
vaccine oh
i've been inoculated against uh kovid 19
but my
my army's a little ouchy wow she
freaking
just want to hold on a sec no i'm not
gonna ban that guy he's this macros he's
he's a nice guy
i'm just i've gotta pretend to be
slightly madder than i am
in order to maintain favor with my
fellow countrymen
oh
do you have any thoughts on the band
brand new
um i don't know brand new
except i had a roommate in university
who listened to them really loudly but i
don't hold it against them
but i always think when people talk
about brand new
that um they're talking about treble
charger because they have an album
that's called brand new low well i wanna
know
have i gone too far because i've
sunk to a brand new low there's nothing
to do
without you you know what i'm talking
about
uh it's a black market it's an ice
bucket challenge it's an ice bucket
challenge
i'm i'm insane i'll take it all man
no i'm i'm done i'm not taking any more
that's crazy
i'm done
i'm 20 and i got vaccinated in romania
what are your thoughts on this
my thoughts are that the phrasing is a
very interesting
uh wrinkle to that anecdote
because the way you've written it make
it the subtext
is that you're a 20 year old american
who went to romania to get vaccinated
which is kind of an interesting little
space to play around with
i think you're probably just from
romania
but the way that it was phrased it it
adds a little wrinkle to the
storytelling i think
twitter semantics guy is he's pogging up
right now
you know it's the the theoretical degree
in physics worse versus the degree in
theoretical physics
like what we were talking about like
last week right the difference between
uh me and my wife had a baby last week
and me and my wife
got a baby last week on some level
the sentences have exactly the same
meaning yet simultaneously you
you say one of them you don't say the
other one unless you're
uh i don't know trying to create an
implication or something
assistant to the regional manager i'm
crazy i'll take anything
oh no my per throw and then you turn it
into amnesia
you're a you're a you're a jerk that's
what you are
you're a jerk
doing some raisin arizona stuff yeah i
was gonna watch that this weekend
um because it's on disney plus
rip tainted version
what if what if we
drop a trinket now
they made it telepills the fool the fool
turns into telepills
yeah but but my my trinket from earlier
is not going to be cracked key anymore
or
maybe it will still be i don't know man
let's just leave some stuff behind
little baggie will turn all cracked keys
into pills instead
i think they fixed that well we'll find
out
it happened to us before we can be we
can test it
we can of course yeah you can always get
starter deck or something
i mean i don't know why i guess cracked
key isn't a trinket it is a card
it makes sense that it would be subject
to the same rules and regulations but
yeah we had a run where we screwed it up
or rather we took little baggie and it
screwed up
for us
because i can't accept responsibility
for that um
tainted keeper is a nightmare you know
we could try to uh
do some tainted keeper here we did
unlock him
spoilers wait no he didn't i i did the
alt path
we could try to unlock the tainted
keeper
take this tainted keeper and learn to
pog again
learn to park champ free
if you see tinted skull back there thank
you thank you tinted skull thank you
tinted skull monday baby
monday baby tinted skull sunday baby
when is the last time you got rick
rolled
um it i think it was like it was
probably within the last year
it still happens pretty regularly
and it's one of those things like the
less popular it gets oh evp
evp tom thank you thank you for the
gifted subscriptions thank you
um the the more the the more that rick
rolling falls
out of favor the easier it is to be rick
roll
because you're not um looking for it
and moreover like kind of being being
rick rolled is like
who cares man you know it's kind of like
a low impact
prank right it's worth a try i guess
like if somebody rick rolls me i'm like
you got me
it's not like a real prank
it's not like somebody you know threw a
flat screen tv on to my head when i was
sleeping on the couch
oh 10 years ago yeah you could throw
hands over it probably
are people still getting iced by the way
like like you know with smearing off ice
is that a real thing
use there used to be a whole series of
rules to being iced like you could uh
you know somebody the basic premise is
that if somebody came up to you
and presented you with a smirnoff ice
and they got down on one knee
you were compelled to drink it
and and by compelled i mean like you
know there was a code
basically people still get iced all the
time
really i've never been iced
i did see when i worked in korea i saw a
friend of mine get iced
i know how that sounds he's still alive
but
i watched him chug uh smirnoff ice
yeah i guess i guess we should right why
not
you also never socialize well yeah but
like i i think the
more accurate point is that i don't
socialize with the kind of people who
just carries
bottles of smeared off ice around them
on the regular
so like so many like nobel prize
nominees
and you know poet laureates and stuff
like that
they're more into like you know
louis xiii and stuff like that
and hennessy by the way and i'm not mad
about it but i do have a bone
to pick i was listing different types of
nobel prizes the other day and i said
literature
and at least 25 people in chat were like
yeah the nobel prize for literature
right
yeah the nobel prize for books so i was
very self-conscious about it
i looked it up and it's a real thing
there is one it's not just for science
obviously not because economics is up
there
and then i was like why did i ever doubt
myself i know it's a real thing because
every week on jeopardy there's a
question about tony morrison
who won the 1993 uh
nobel prize in literature
okay sneak it in here bob dylan did win
it
and honest i'm being straight up with
you i think joanna newsom's probably
gonna win it
they're they're gonna the the nobel
prize
committee is going to listen to east and
they're gonna be like we gotta give her
the prize for literature
she deserves it absolutely
now do you think if we
took if we took
the super key it would open the door for
us i also do not think so okay thank you
for freeing me from this
and car battery is kind of it's a it's
weird as
with the void i don't i don't know if i
like it
who do you think should be the next
nobel prize in mathematics easy answer
goodwill hunting
runner-up jimmy neutron
it's gone just get over
there is no i almost got baited
there's a math nobel prize for sure
otherwise how would they recognize the
the guy who invented
uh multiplication
there actually isn't really
it surprises me
oh the fields metal yeah mrs fields
yeah what the heck was up with alfred
nobel
you know he's like physics love it
economics yeah peace i'm for it
literature love to read
math who said that
who the hell said that i heard you
you said it with your whole chest a
couple of seconds ago
and now you're all quiet
so go ahead someone out here said math
what the hell i just don't know what his
problem he's kind of a jerk huh
he said matt you said yo you said math
though i
looked this nominee in the window of her
soul
and i said
daryl i suggested seven other
disciplines
no
no the feelings can't get to us they're
they're just performing a play right
now
they should make a chess nobel prize uh
honestly i feel like i would be in
contention this year
for um inventing
the theory of getting weird with it i
offer you a knight you give me two pawns
yeah i'm kind of hoping that maybe like
we can cheese it with telepills or maybe
we'll just
open the chest and the chest will have
the key in it
maybe you can give me the cracked key
somehow i mean i i can't imagine how it
would happen but
just just think about it
just think about it come on man
whoa uh month uh
14 of quarantine uh
got me feeling a certain kind we feeling
a certain sort of way about this
purple circle going getting increasing
and decreasing radius
rhythmically month
month 17 of quarantine
got me feeling something
what's the worst code you've ever
written
so i did uh i've told part of this story
before
i did a java assignment um
for my like
i mean it was advanced but i don't want
to say like it was like
on the cutting edge of java um
but it was like the advanced course at
my college and
i did the assignment but i was in
iceland at
my friend's wedding so like i couldn't i
had no resources
to like ask for help
and it was like the assignment needed uh
to use
this library i think it's called jdbc
that like
allows you to connect to servers and
then you know
so you you would basically it was a full
application that would connect to a
server
and then you would have it would get
records for you and then you would build
like an
uh an interface that would display them
and i just remember like
couldn't quite get it to work properly
without having
access to uh to my professor
uh but i got it like kind of working
but i just kept building on top of like
the bad uh
design in the first place and it
never came to pass anyway
like i'm sorry i don't have a more
specific specific example
but basically it's one of those things
where like imagine you built the
foundation of the building wrong and you
had no
time to fix it so i just kept like
putting masking tape over
the cracks to try to get it to stay
together
i mean i don't mind doing another zazel
run this one was was fun
certainly unfortunate that we won't be
able to well i don't know
we can still fight the beast right like
i would i would rather try to fight the
beast than
than use telepills but if we're down to
one hp we'll telepills
which is looking increasingly likely
revival
no longer vibing no longer vibing
yeah dude that personally
my two cents little baggie should not
function like that
i feel like a little baggie should not
ruin cracked key
it is so stupid um it is coherent don't
get me wrong like it makes sense because
cracked key is obviously like a
a it takes up the slot of a card or a
rune or whatever but
also just just kind of annoying
i feel like it's not working as intended
i think we're probably gonna die but
we'll see
anyway i forgot what i was talking about
for the most part i was
i was a pretty good student when it came
to coding
um but i don't think that means i was
like
pret or naturally talented i think what
it really came down to is having already
done
like a bachelor's degree in another
discipline i understand
time management better than i did when i
was 19.
yeah tough code never lasts only tough
coders
last
that's probably true right like so
someone in chat said the worst code
you'll write is the code you write as a
professional
i guess as a professional like as long
as it just works
like there's nobody there to like
uh you know get on your case about it
using three times as many like cycles as
it needs to or something
i always go back to like when the
celeste developers released
their uh
their source code and like all the
armchair reddit programmers were like
what a their character controller is
like a mess you're like you realize like
making a
a video game is like it's not about
writing the most
elegant character controller it's about
like making the best video game and they
did an awesome job at that
no i mean i look again this is stolen
valor because i'm not like a real
programmer
um but like
my code was readable if anything the
complaint that i got was whenever i
brought up the fact
that well no we don't even need to go
down this road
but basically any any time
you write uh at least to other students
anytime you write code that's very
verbose
they get annoyed and they're like don't
you know instead of using a key value
pair you could just
do like uh an inline uh tuple
instead and you're like yeah but then
like i wouldn't know what i'm reading
i thought we could get out of the way
there
so i i always aired on this i've always
i forgot that hit as well
i always forgot or i always figured i
should say
that the best code you could write
for readability is actually like overly
written
and like explicitly written instead of
just like check it out i wrote the whole
program in like one really long line
and i'm like that's very clever like if
if i saw it i would admire it
but if you were like hey the guy who
wrote this doesn't work here anymore can
you fix it i would be like
you owe me a million dollars well at
least we did
unlock little abaddon the run had some
some merit to it all right slash marker
tinted tainted azazel
attempt



jacob all right uh we're playing his
tainted jacob we unlocked him in the
last run i have no
idea what this character does but he
does have ana masola
han solo um and
what appear to be great stats let's see
let's see
ana masola
it recharges okay
that's pretty cool that's i would
describe that as heavily cool
so whenever you see an item in the uh
bottom right corner that means it's an
active item
but uh oh
what the heck it's an active item
but you can't get rid of it it's like a
permanent active
24 hour active permanent
i thought this might be how this goes
you got to run away
you got to run away from this guy for
the whole game huh
that's a lot um
maybe he gave up i thought he gave up
for a second
i i was you know what hold on check this
out
what if i what if i trap you what if i
trap you you son of a gun
um all right is does he
does that only spawn because of my use
of the
uh of the space bar item
no it spawns no matter what it spawns 30
seconds after no matter what
all right well in that case you know
that fly is screwed man
yeah so that's that's redacted esau i
understand now
don't waste your time shooting them
don't waste your time on him
his hp is so high you'll wanna
die
okay so if we don't
get hit for a bit
it's good saved
because we don't want to become the lust
if we can avoid it
maybe we could get him to do
contact damage to the boss speed down
was really not what i was looking for
there
um if we could get him to do contact
damage
to the boss maybe he'll take so much
damage
as a result of it that he'll find
himself in a world of hurt i don't know
i am stoked that our dps improved
as a result of uh experimental treatment
but
okay get him to crash into the boss if
possible
you know what maybe this is where we
don't
uh shoot baby plum and we get an item
instead
okay little little offended
you already shot him so it's too late f
f baby plum baby
f yeah
don't be shy hit the boss why am i not
shooting then why am i not
tell me chat why am i not shooting at
this guy what's wrong with me got him
got him
okay i'm just gonna level you this seems
like pretty hard
i was really hoping that it wouldn't be
a pill like that but sure
um yeah this seems pretty tough
you're not following me anymore right
yeah yeah then we get another 30 seconds
you know why not
i just so when you see people get timed
out it's a little
um s when you read
insanely quickly and you realize that
they got timed out for typing the entire
transcript of monday baby
you go you know what i i don't recommend
you do it because moobot's gonna
it's gonna eat you indiscriminately but
it is funny
it's a great video
come on man come on are you
you're like even faster now what's up
with that
rude
do we have more on band requests um i
think we had like one
but they're not gonna get unbanned so
i'm not gonna read it out loud
no it's not banal
panel still he's he's a vip right vips
are
above the law
yeah we got a couple in there but like
mostly like
i deal with the easy on band requests on
stream
the ones that are like you know i said
something i shouldn't have said
eight years ago and also like the chat
log doesn't even exist
those are easy enough
that was very nice thank you uh watch
this oh
baby
so smart
he's a genius a subscriber oh
yeah that's my triple collateral on
free-for-all
i don't know like i don't maybe i
shouldn't waste my time doing this but
he's already a voice inside my uh
he had don't you think apollo could do
a great mid-2000s pop punk
impression oh if you kill him you become
the lost
your point
your point being what's your point
you might as well kill him now but he's
gonna come back next time right like
he's gonna he's gonna come back on the
next floor anyway
and annoy me
you just gotta reclaim your soul kill
him now and you die instantly
if you'll excuse me i i do hear some
some banging going on outside
what's up with that oh my god
like it's like seven packages
[Laughter]
kate what the heck did you order
oh my god
i just hit him with the wave but like a
good lord one of them's got heavy on it
i don't know oh you
you don't you're not the lost on the
next floor okay that's good to know
this is doable i
i wish they were rtx 380s
do i i don't know like you know what i'm
gonna say it's gonna make you upset
we already got a 2080 ti in here
like i know the 3080 is like better
but i probably wouldn't even open my
computer to install it
maybe if it came with the ability to
super
heat via the power of convection
and make uh reheating crispy foods a
breeze i might consider it but
does that too i i thought that was only
the the kfc console that did that
dude there you go i no i don't think
they could do a pc and air fryer like in
combination
because it would combine like the two
most insufferable
uh consumer demographics in one
pc gamers and people who own an air
fryer like the amount of smug
i don't even know it would take years of
environmental uh recuperation to
allow the world to be able to breathe
normally again
i knew it was coming too i knew it was
coming
you're describing yourself yes this is
the joke correct
that's the you got it
you're just supposed to you're not
supposed to try to stay
say the punch line when you recognize
the punch line you just type
lull and then that's the easiest way
into the good books
you just type lull or la mao all caps is
really good
like earlier when bear was here earlier
okay that was sick when bear was here
earlier
he typed lull and i was like it's the
most flattering thing ever to see a
streamer use the lull emote to describe
your content
i was i was unbelievably flattered
what about what about lowercase lamount
still good i prefer uppercase le man
if you're gonna do lowercase lemal
you have to
help you have to do many o's at the end
you can't just do la mao full stop
you have to do like limo
otherwise it's considered an insult i
would say
yeah yeah put these chains on
put them onto the boss you know judas
priest
screaming for vengeance
it's a great album man
might go a little hard for you no it's
not for the
for the unfamiliar amongst us
oh let me in great album one one of
1977's best albums
no thank you
yes thank you no thing no thank you
he said among us this mf
said among us
edmund i just want to talk
try again okay
that that was not good damage i'll give
you that one
i think i understand i'm just i'm i'm
playing pretty badly
invincibility doesn't work against esau
of course how could i be so stupid
i should have known
who made this
this may be the hardest character in the
game now
false judas he starts with one hp
it's impossible no no gamer has gotten
to that level yet it's too many
dang it's too few dang hearts for any
sane man to comprehend
help okay so now i'm i'm realizing the
way we want to do this okay
rage is actually pretty good
what we're gonna do is trap him
and then release him
we're in a position where it'll hit
enemies and make my life easier okay why
am i shooting them
i think i'm starting to figure it out
that he's just like
he's basically like brimstone
like look at that he's basically like a
brimstone
laser that can also hurt you
okay he actually curved the bullet
such a high degree of disrespect shan't
be forgotten anytime soon
he's just a cool bob's brain i'm not
like other bob's brains i'm a cool bob's
brain
yeah yeah yeah run run up here run up
yeah yeah yeah great stuff great stuff
guess what squeeb um squead failed
get him get him saved saved okay i mean
we gotta try
freaking esau baby woo yeah baby
esau damage baby um everything got
better except shot speed we call that
that's an all-stats upgrade okay he's
getting it
it is a lot of damage plus we get a
little time to just chill
ah is a little hp down oh is that
supposed to be like scary or something
i would say hp is the less you have the
more valuable it is so if anything we
just had a big bonus right there
plus i mean it's the most abundant
resource in the game
so
f okay get frozen elsa
elsa
okay i'm just gonna just gonna treat you
like mushrooms
feed you crap and keep you in the dark
the freaking departed send them
not not worth not worth but we're
farming damage
how is this character any good isn't he
just strictly worse
um yeah i think like i think so
but that's not like a fundamental uh
like betrayal of the isaac design
philosophy i think there's a lot of
characters in the game who are
essentially just worse than others
in order to give you some variety and
some some difficulty as well
yeah plus this actually seems like uh
to be straight up with you not that much
more challenging
than the default version of the
character because at least you only have
to dodge
with you know yourself instead of with
two different characters
with some bombs man come on
oh you're toasted you knew it was coming
even before it happened great rosary as
well
probably we won't take the pills we'll
just get the heck out of town
do you play isaac mouse and keyboard or
do you play on controller
i i've always been a a mouse and
keyboard guy
i know uh jay is a controller guy
cobalt's a controller guy i think i
don't know about corey i think he might
be a controller guy as well i've always
been
uh well yeah not mouse just keyboard
corey as well yeah i don't what i would
say
is i don't think it makes like an
enormous difference
um i think it's just whatever you're
used to i definitely don't think it's a
situation where like you can do things
on the controller you can't do on the
mouse
or on the keyboard i should say maybe
when you pick up like analog
tiers it's you can actually utilize the
like 360 degree shooting but i honestly
don't know
a little easier to slow walk too that
makes sense
but like but what do you what does slow
walking even do
it makes you walk slow like i'll make
the joke for you but
why don't you just run at full speed uh
and not get hit when you go through the
uh diagonal walking to begin with
it's not that hard it's not what i meant
to do but i
consider myself lucky very nice
mouse with no keyboard whoa
nope i will be leaving now okay this is
another enemy that should be pretty
easy to destroy here
we're just chilling just getting our
charge
come on come
come on
he's a little tankier than i remember
who made this
save saved still quite painful but saved
no thank you hp is gonna be a very
valuable resource for us here
relatively clean fight keep the hp
common
anima sola
why in my head i was trying to think of
what jabba the hutt says and all i could
think of was
bobby cannavale mr solo
but that's literally just an actor who
plays
uh
ant-man's uh romantic rival in the
in in the ant-man movies
mr solo
got him yeah yeah it's a good idea
becoming the lost
to take a devil deal item for free it
seems like an extremely uh
actually very very useful tactic like
foundational tactic
and then we just go down to the next
floor asap so we probably i don't know
the devil deal might be uh
might be uh lost to us on this floor
we'll see when we go back into the room
but
we'll try to remember no keys huh
i got a little greedy give me a key
please no key
i mean it's fine because this is bombs
are key
i guess addicted technically doesn't
matter
still a dick still addicted to
taking a pill in the game i only take
pills in the game
when i get a little bored still a dick
still too well really i'm addicted to
like adult peekaboo in this game
dan's kind of right when he says like
the the pills are so much fun because
it's a little loot box every single time
whoa
[Laughter]
excuse me
also pretty good
24-hour dan permanent
excuse me excuse me
he's in free devil deal free devil deal
baby
uh is this item is actually i i prefer
not to have it than to have it but we
did get it for free
so there is that
[Laughter]
i'll just pretend i've not got it and
i'll just take the stats
and not aim my tears for now maybe
in some situations now i'm realizing you
know if you were really low on hp
to put yourself outside of an enemy's
line of sight and then just rain
shots in that seems it seems pretty
sweet
huge whiff
this run actually has the potential
though
so i think that the only other thing i
guess i would say that i've i
think i've learned on this run so far is
if we're gonna take the deal with the
devil
if we're gonna get it oh that's not
that's never gonna hit if we're gonna
get in the habit
we should do the boss room last so that
we can become the lost
on the room i can't believe i didn't get
hit
um we're free so that we can become the
lost
on the room and then immediately go down
to the next level
i think that's the ticket
incredible very well done taking damage
making flub out of nothing at all there
you go my brain needed
it was like it's been too long since you
made a joke
greedy
yeah dude i don't even want to like
think about
come on how we're gonna
do the alt path with this character
seems like it's gonna be a little
difficult
but for now you know let's not worry
about that there i mean there was a time
when you played isaac
it was like oh beating mom that's like
crazy
i don't even know if such a thing is is
pop
is possible okay um speaking of which
bad move on my part
well um i don't know
nobody to blame but myself for that one
really
kind of a tough room though when you can
only get hit one time
you know what would have been a nice
defense not getting hit one time at all
no this come on i'm not gonna hit him
with a slash marker after like three ten
minute runs of losing
youtube's in the habit they they want
like 45 minute episodes and
i'm making so much isaac i'm not in a
position to say no
okay there you go good trinket
yeah not we don't do three 10 minute
runs around these parts we do
four 10 minute runs okay i know that
this has a chance now instead of a
guarantee to produce coins
i'm so dumb i was like i'll just press
it and then dodge
it's all worth it it's all worth it for
the poop
yeah they really did a great job with
the with the tainted characters
so close
like it's completely transformative it's
i it's
so nice that it's not just like um
oh you know it's like they have more
damage but less hp
you know they're super uh
they're super different donkey donkey
donk
all right i can't fly anymore
the poop has been buffed yeah okay cool
you ever hear the expression you can
polish a turd
seems seems fitting in this one
anyway i had dude you know what's
interesting
so again you know weird flex okay but
for for lunches throughout the week we
have this meal delivery service
that the the purpose of this is not me
flexing but
you know there it is so every sunday
ten meals get delivered
and all i have to do is
reheat them let's go uh or
just you know if some of them are are
able to be eaten at refrigerator
temperature
and it teaches me a lot about how i
actually
feel about food preferences because like
right now i got 10
meals in the fridge you know little man
put those meals in my hand
10 meals in the fridge right now just
cleared out tomato town
et cetera et cetera um
so i get to make the first overall draft
pick tonight
and i got to tell you i got a lot of
options there's
chicken fried rice there's slow cooked
pulled beef which is a a very funny
word a very funny meal to begin with
pulled beef i thought uh hey that
doesn't sound like something i want to
eat it sounds like something
you something something
it's a joke about jerking it um
but anyway out of all the meals you know
there's there's a
fried chickpea wrap there's some chicken
tandori etc etc going on in there
why wouldn't i go to the item room after
that but uh
out of all the stuff that's in there i'm
telling you sincerely
what number one meal on the list
chicken caesar salad it's
it's gonna win it's gonna be first
overall
very nice uh
we're we're gonna say don't go to the
item room
go ahead and hit me
we'll take too spooky
and i'm not afraid we're gonna you know
what i'm gonna fight the mini boss we're
gonna go to the item room
out of all the meals and i i had to
think about it because when i was
loading the fridge i want to make sure
i'm loading up the uh you know the meals
i like the least i put them at the back
and the meals i like the most you know i
put those sons of guns
at the front okay so that i was very
scared that we ruined our whole run
there
um but yeah chicken caesar salad
i think it's it's winning the power
rankings every time the only other thing
i will say on the flip side of that
oh we were toasted is um
sometimes i would take maybe the
chickpea wrap
before the chicken caesar salad it just
depends whether i got time for a fork
lunch
or whether it's going to be a handheld
marty
chicken caesar salad and banana
have you gone mad
ever decide to just mix them in one meal
you asking me if i ever decided to eat
10 lunches at the same time i i haven't
a couple of reasons one is a lot of the
foods i don't think would go together
another big one uh like for sure
is that it would really screw up like my
mood for the rest of the week i think to
to not have access to meals i also think
it's just kind of like a little
overkill honestly you know 10 lunches at
once
i think i'm like a maximum three lunches
at one sort of guy
if i ate a lunch that was like three
lunches worth of matter or calories
i think i could make it happen but
10 is a little too much
for me at least
just move just move it just move it good
stuff
okay freeze them freeze them freeze them
i hate this room i hate it
the enemies are too strong they're too
close to me i can't kill the one that's
spawning
use bombs use bombs name a woman
that's gonna hurt
i i disagree with your take that too
spooky stinks i actually think
too spooky is uh i think it's incredible
freak you yoga mat name a woman
sorry
all time one of the top 10 youtube
videos ever made
you will never get this you will never
get this
until one day he got it
it's a great one when i say top 10 i
don't mean
it's on the list of the top 10 i just
mean that it's very good
there's probably like 500 videos on my
top 10.
and i don't think i don't i don't see
any cognitive dissonance as a result of
that
saved saved
dude this it's a little spooky you know
what would be like an incredible
uh item here just throwing this out
there in case the game's listening
uh hp of like literally any sort
yeah top 10's more like it's just a
feeling man it's just the feeling
the other thing that's interesting to
note is that music is a lot like
love it's all a feeling and it fills the
room from the floor to the ceiling
i don't know if anyone's ever thought of
that before
item room you're not wrong i i did just
get a key we're going back
end it makes my heart sing exactly
whoa hey man get out of here
i'm actually hooked on a feeling right
now what does that mean
i'm actually hooked on a feeling that
seems scary
what feeling is it because like if
you're hooked on like you know
love or something like that that's
pretty good but if you're hooked on
hunger
count me out man that doesn't sound like
fun at all
although you know what would be a good
pill
what about a pill that instantly makes
you hungry
and i know you're gonna say why would i
ever want that
because you could pop it 20 minutes
before you're gonna eat
and then your meal would be that much
more satisfying
because i think like the most satisfying
time for a meal
is like when you're hungry but you also
have to deal with the misery
of being well misery is maybe a little
heavy but you know what i mean the
discomfort
of being hungry for a time until the
meal is ready
so instead you could just freaking pop
it
right before you're about to eat and
then you'd be like oh this really hits
the spot
i haven't eaten for 45 minutes
that'd be pretty sick man i did see
someone in chad say why
eat if you're not hungry i too have
never met a
another human being in my life so
i'm interested to hear your perspective
on this
that might be too far i apologize but
come on
why eat when you're not hungry
because it's fun man food tastes good
why not why not
it makes my heart sing okay sorry we
can't
can't keep leaning on that makes my
heart sing line as hilarious as it is
zayn acquired yeah don't don't shoot it
the enemy right now you're good you're
good you're good
you're good scream
what about an anti-hungry pill seems
dangerous
seems seems like a potential way to
accidentally like
starve yourself to death
which i would describe as a negative
okay now you get your slash marker



take it to the door i don't think i was
making it to the button though
oh no all right let's run it back
jacob and esau always uh always fun
always uh
always a trip catch the spirit catch the
spit
i just it's the same problem every time
i'm always like we'll play it by ear
and if the run's good we'll try the alt
path and then i'm like well we got to
try the alt path we spawn with the key
and then i'm like well we got to
continue with the alt path because we
already
got we already suffered through the
dross not to mention the drachel
so we might just yeah i don't know maybe
we'll see we'll play it by ear
we'll see how it goes
see what our you know if our first deal
with the devil maybe gave us something
incredible that would or if we got like
teleported to one here that would that
would change my
my mind a little did you get your bubbly
yesterday king
so i didn't get any uh i didn't go to
the grocery store yesterday but i did
get subway and they they have
tall cans of bubbly so i did have 500
milliliters of blackberry bubbly
there's something about a a king can of
sparkling water i don't know how to feel
about it
it's like being like a a tech ceo
worth you know seven figures or
nine figures and then um
choosing to drink pap's blue ribbon it's
it's it's just a little
just feels weird i'm for it though
well sir smith 811
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
there's more king canes of bubbly i do
wish they sold king cans of
of bubbly like i guess if
we're gonna get into it like let's get
into it no i mean like in in the case
at the grocery store i think that you
know
355 milliliters or whatever the the
default you know soda size is
oh handsome pants thank you as well
looking forward to seeing you out on the
hard court
at some point thank you i think it makes
sense
for like a soda or a juice or something
like that
because you know you want to have almost
like an artificial limitation there
because they're not that good for you or
maybe even just not good for you at all
it's a better
and more accurate way to describe it um
but with like sparkling water
it's good for you or at least it's you
know neutral
um i'm like they could make the default
size for those 500 milliliters
355 is is is for babies
okay you know what let's not do alt path
let's be smart
yeah yeah let's do it take me down
your teeth are gonna pop off if you keep
drinking sparkling water
i'll believe it when i see it you know
what you are right now you're the people
that uh
you know with no scientific literature
they're like if you pop your knuckles
all the time you're gonna end up with
like arthritis
and then it's one of these like farmer's
almanac like
myths that persist despite the fact that
there's no science to back it up
i i looked up the other like because i i
get gas-lit by chat i'm like is
sparkling water bad for you
and then according to the scientific
literature
the answer is a distinctive and
statistically significant no
you got nothing to worry about now i
mean should you drink
12 cans of it a day maybe not i don't
know
for your pocketbook more than anything
else
give me a second on this one okay i mean
it's still
good it's still good
yeah i've seen that it's like the
classic like
dumb but hilarious scientific experiment
where the guy just uh
cracked one knuckle
or one hand's knuckles for like 10 years
and discovered or 50 years and
discovered there was no difference
like it's pretty hilarious
okay good good good one guy is
incredible
is you know one guy who tested it versus
like you know
one guy who heard from his grandma who
read it in a book that was printed on
like you know
cow leather back in the 1700s i'll take
the guy who's actually tested it
yeah exactly one guy who who lived the
experience versus uh
source dude just trust me i know i know
where i'm putting my hands in i know i
know whose hand i'm going in with
thank you um that is a pill it's a good
pill
i told you you can just tell it's just
you can tell by like the weight in your
hands
um i got a question for you okay i don't
know you might think i'm i'm crazy for
this one but it's not unusual
do you think when let's say you pick up
a jar
and the jar is full of jelly beans this
is just a hypothetical like thought
experiment
do you think you can approximate both
the weight
of the jar and the weight of the jelly
beans in it or do you think your brain
just sees it as one piece of
uh one one object with mass
because i was like you're
again you're gonna you're gonna think
i've lost my mind
i i had there was a jar with some ice
cream okay
and i'm telling you as soon as i picked
it up i got two pieces of data
one was the weight of the jar and the
other one was the weight of the ice
cream inside of the jar
and it kind of it doesn't make sense
but it also kind of makes sense because
i've picked up that
jar so much in my life that i know the
approximate weight of the jar
and i know the approximate weight of the
jar when it's full
you know i know what it feels like in my
hand so i think it was my brain was
doing like a comparative analysis
of that i think you can if you pick up
an object
you can infer the approximate weight of
the container
versus the weight of the things inside
of it
that's my two cents
how much does mr boom weigh that's they
haven't invented touch of vision
at least not in these games yet so i
can't give you an answer
this is another thing that i would like
to test quite frankly
um if you know once once covid's over
and i
no longer have an excuse to not make
creative content on twitch
i think i think we should we should run
a test along with the sparkling water
taste test and
the pepsi challenge
[Laughter]
i'm telling you i think there's
something to it
called v-logs turn text to speech on at
the restaurant and then like you know
say uh something terrible and then
people look at me it's endless content
i'm an artist go ahead take it take it
take it now of course oh
i'm baked ziti great name great name
um the irony on this run
without a doubt is that i'm looking at
what we have right now and i'm like
oh this is easy all path man i should
have gone to the alt path
what a fool
but as soon as we go to the alt path
we're going to be like what the heck we
got no hp
i really i want to do
a sparkling water taste test because i
also i have a theory
as well and again this is i i can't
stand by this
but my theory is that all sparkling
water tastes exactly the same
which i shouldn't say uh until we know
that bubbly is not sponsoring the
channel
but having having tasted lacroix
bubbly and uh president's choice blue
menu sparkling water
i give you about a zero percent chance
that in a a statistically significant
sample i could meaningfully tell the
difference between them
let's do it you keep saying it just do
the taste test already
we'll want to but like there's it's
gonna cost me
i mean not even the money really because
i'll drink all the sparkling water
but they only sell the dang uh bubblies
and lacroix in uh eight to 12 packs here
so in order to do a taste test i'm gonna
have to i don't know buy like
288 different sparkling water cans
i don't even know where i'm gonna put
them man but i'll figure it out
okay hold on who got number one you got
number one so you go ahead and take the
range up
and then oh you know what that's a good
point a gas station
at a gas station i could probably do
that yeah yeah
yeah yeah that's a good idea
i do whole foods sells individual
lacroix but i've never seen an
individual bubbly
but i i just need to go into a place
where either the pepsi or the coke lobby
has been
in order to get singles placed into the
store
shoppers are rexall as well you know
what i never thought about that's a good
point
donkey donkey dunk
you have to account for bottle versus
can difference i don't i
are there sparkling waters that come in
bottles
i got it well i guess san pellegrino
sure fair enough
um i got another hot take for you
sparkling water tastes better out of the
can
because i think cans and i mean as long
as we're talking about asinine takes
cans get colder than bottles
or maybe they just maintain their
coldness
or maybe they just feel colder to the
hand and it has like a psychological
effect but
there's something to it
like i know people like the glass bottle
uh cokes
i can't disagree with that but um
sparkling water in a can i like it
better than out of like those plastic
san pellegrino bottles
plus don't even get me started man san
pellegrino corporation is so episode you
know what
they sell 275 milliliter bottles of
san pellegrino sparkling water
it's like a thimbleful like what's wrong
with you want me to pay
three bucks for a 275 milliliter bottle
you're insane
like get over yourself you're no longer
the only
uh corporation with access to the
sparkling reservoirs
it's mineral water yeah but like
that's not why i'm drinking it
i'm drinking it because it's it it has a
fizz
it's the fizz baby
they're minerals marie it's mineral
water
be a good bit if they bring hank back
for breaking bad too
they can have him get really into
mineral water that'd be cool
it's not shelter marie it's mineral
water
she'd be like listening but in her head
she's just thinking about all those like
decorative spoons she wants
and now do you have any more viral video
takes um
apollo linked me to a vine that i hadn't
seen in a long time
that i thought was uh a very funny vine
it's the one where the guy walks in
through the door um
and then they startle him and he goes
and i forget what he says after he does
this
he gets in like his taekwondo pose and
then uh
he goes like i could kill you dude don't
even try or something like that
it's really good i'm not even worried
about it yeah that's it
that's good yeah i'm not using book of
the dead um
i mean like it's good don't get me wrong
but i'm also like enjoying the all stats
upgrade i'm getting from
the trinket you can't see that's behind
my head right now it's vibrant bulb
yeah yeah you can kind of see it here
i'll move out of the way i could have
killed you man i'm not even worried
about it
it's so good the things
like i if you want to hear the funniest
thing that could ever come out of
somebody's mouth
it always happens right after they get
either scared
or mad but at the exact moment they
realize that there's no reason for them
to really be mad
that's the that's the best
one of the best who do you think you are
i am that's a
great example so he's in an inflamed
emotional uh
state he says something nonsensical you
can kind of understand the spirit of it
but it comes out hilariously
i never seen this before it's the exact
uh
it's exactly what i'm thinking of when i
get scared i say some funny things i get
mad when i get startled then i realize
like oh there's no reason for me to be
mad but the emotion is still there it
takes like a little bit for your body to
you know buffer out the acetylcholine or
whatever
okay yeah it means a long life it's a
long life we should you know what we
should do
here's what we should do you know what
we should do jacob
jacob you take this for a second so you
can use book of the dead
and then esau you take that son of a gun
and then jacob you take this because we
love bombs
there we go
yo that's cool i i did not see that
isaac
set a record for uh concurrent players
but honestly like i'm not surprised
if you'll excuse me here um repentance
is actually like
so unbelievably good
i am i'm not surprised that isaac is
like
i mean you would think it would hit a
peak to begin with just because like
it's had so much time pardon me to
cultivate an audience
so you know assuming people weren't just
insanely tired of it in general
it makes sense that this would be like
the peak of its popularity
but then on top of that they did such a
good job with the dlc
so i can i can totally uh i can
absolutely understand it
is it your game of the year i don't know
man i don't know like
man do i do like
come on man i don't i don't know all
that stuff man i don't know
dang old game of the year and everything
i mean it's april the 11th
for one it's also like it's you know
we're in that
covet bubble where like nothing else is
gonna come out this year i don't know
like gaming this year is gonna be like
the movies were last year where
until like august people were like sonic
the hedgehog best picture
but we'll see i don't know i don't
really i don't concern myself too much
like what was my game of the year last
year i don't remember
deadly premonition too
ouch that hurts spelunky too
oh yeah yeah yeah it was probably
spelunky too
that makes sense i mean sort of spelunky
two is an incredible game
clubhouse was up there monster train
that's right yeah
monster train great game great game
really good game
really big game
come on come on got him
get bodied you stink you continue to
stink
was it not hades i don't feel qualified
to talk about hades because most of my
time and it
um was in the pre 1.0 version
it's an amazing game but i know like as
soon as i describe it it's like oh it's
my third favorite game of the year
people are going to be like don't care
didn't ask plus you didn't play 1.0
so my take is not required um
i'm being gate kept
i do like by the way that matchbook
always gives you matchstick now
it's a cool i mean it seems very
sensible
okay thank depp's one let's give it a
try
bullet ball extreme it'll catch your eye
that's a what
it's a bullet ball bullet ball
bullet ball that's a bullet ball
hot take monster train better than hades
hot take
um let's not let's not argue you know
like
it's all it's all good it's not really
that big of a deal like i don't think
anyone's gonna be like super upset but
like
can i hit you with a like a nice who
cares like you know if this
if that's your opinion that's fine but
like
i think uh it's an argument that doesn't
uh
doesn't lead to anything productive
there's no self-discovery in it
there's just uh there's there's no anger
in it there's no emotion of any sort
it's just uh
it's a masturbatory display of rhetoric
insubordinate and churlish
the only like the the game of the year
list that mattered like
here's maybe this makes me a contrarian
i don't really care about doing game of
the year list because i see them
kind of like um like tearless
in the sense that like people only read
them to be like my
game of the year wasn't at number one so
i'm mad and here's why you're wrong
um the the flip side there is that i
would much rather like argue about
sandwiches and cereals than about video
games because i just know more about
them
to begin with so i don't uh want to
discuss them anymore because i already
have the right opinion
and the dissent is just likely to make
me upset in the first place whereas with
sandwiches
there's a little bit more of a
rhetorical you know white space that we
can
we can explore okay hold on things are
getting spicy
however what i like to do is always go
to bed for the games that do
badly in traditional outlets game of the
year awards
and then like try to be their champion
like for example
when people like
they they disrespected tetris 99
because tetris 99 was a free game and
it's just
tetris and it you know it's multiplayer
only and it doesn't
mirror the effects of having uh you know
micro dosing on shrooms or whatever
um people they wouldn't put it in their
year-end list they were like no i'd
rather hey give me another sony
exclusive game where like
you know 10 seconds after popping the
game into the
console you can take your hands off the
controller and not put them back
on until monday when you hit the x
button to kill the final boss right
i'll always go to bed for a for a
mechanics driven game that that does
things well
that's exactly how i felt about slay the
spire as well it's like
i was like a slave aspire it gets a lot
of credit
but it doesn't get enough credit
[Laughter]
because people are like well i it can't
be game of the year because the art is
kind of not my style
okay maybe your fart is not my style
so stop talking butt head got him i
think
got him
so it's basically all i got i'm not
really interested in being like is this
the best game of the year and then you
like
the sigil of baphomet um and then you're
like no
actually you're a fool uh you know this
uh
i'm trying to think of what even came
out this year he doesn't he doesn't
respect loop hero
i'd much rather be like dude pac-man
though every time you kill an enemy you
get some invincibility
that seems incredible
okay i should have no get me out get me
out don't don't pay out with hearts
there come
f i hate you oh he still paid out with
the demon heart
f i i hate you even more than i hated
you a second ago
got him got him
now the only challenges i've actually
completed i completed the
scat man
this might be conjoined and i
finally completed um
blood rights is where uh bloody mary i
should say okay take me down take me
down
we'll do some challenges at some point
bloody mary sapped my will to live a
little bit
just to be straight up with you curses
baby curses
you're so money you know your mouth you
know what i'm talking about
swingers that's a movie you're so you're
so cursed
baby and you don't even know it
i forgot i was gonna say oh yeah so
hitman 3 came out in 2021
that the the critics did not put out a
hit on
hitman 3 but i am surprised like how
and it's just in like my own circle of
friends and colleagues right
i'm kind of surprised at how fast like
the game died
the streamers put out a hit on it i
don't know just to play minecraft
instead
sad
imagine implying
probably because it didn't innovate very
much i don't know
i mean if you that's not what i want out
of hitman is like you know
add in like a vault button
i'm a big fan of just like please make
more maps which is
pretty much what they're doing
did you play the demon souls remake i
did
and like we're kind of you know i don't
want to cause any problems here
but i'm like um it apparently is hot
take sunday
it's a good game but it's my
it's second from the bottom on my
soulsborne tier list
dark souls 2 is the undisputed champion
of the of the pile of drek
and um
demon souls was better
but still not nearly as good
as dark souls 3 bloodborne sakura or
or uh dark souls 1. wait dark souls
the other ones
the devil card and perthro i mean we got
to use perthro at some point
yeah no and i actually think like to
some extent i think nostalgia is like a
fair thing to like in a game
um although it gets a bad rap even from
me myself at times
but like part of the reason i like dark
souls 1 so much is probably a little bit
nostalgic it's possible that
demon souls is actually better than dark
souls 1 but
because i played dark souls 1 is my
first souls game and also
i played it when i was 22 instead of you
know 32
maybe i've changed as a human being a
little bit
and you know the the way i experienced
those games might have
might have changed the way i feel about
them
i don't know what this is
but there were a few areas in dark souls
or in demon souls where i was like i
hate this
but the game as a whole it's good i i
respect it and also like
it's like the anti-slave aspire it's
gorgeous
and also what else are you gonna play on
the ps5 except for that in crash
bandicoot 4
it's about time exclamation point crash
in the chat please
and bug snack sorry i forgot about bug
snacks
and like originally i was going to play
mlb the show and i might still play mlb
the show on it but now i'm like
and it'll be the show is ah
wrong button uh mlb the show is coming
out on freaking game pass
so why would i buy it on ps5 when i
could just get it
for free on on game pass
okay smelt me you smelt it you doubted
and then trade back
smelt me
and then hold it yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
leaving me hanging on ps5 i mean that's
the thing dude and don't get me wrong
this is like
extremely first world problem but like
my ps5 and switch are in my office
the xbox is hooked up in the living room
so like my choice is do i want to
tinted rock under shop oh tinted skull
yeah thank you thank you do you i want
to go through the trouble of swapping
the consoles to save
the purchase price of
mlb the show
i don't know i'm still discussing it in
my head to this day
i'm still thinking about it
hold on we could just get decadent and
then if anybody gets on our case
claim that oh sorry for stimulating the
economy during a pandemic
sorry sorry i guess i'll just let the
world um
economy collapse because you won't let
me buy the same game two times
you can always just do that okay okay
hold on we're good right we're good yeah
yeah
are we gonna get a road to the show
stream i'm really excited for the show
but i can already tell you what's gonna
happen
because it comes out like i think at the
end of this week right or maybe the
start of next week
um depending on whether you're willing
to buy the 100
uh super edition that gives you access
like three days
early or whatever which i have done in
the past
for sure um because i'm everything wrong
with the industry
however um
be that as it may i uh
hold on hold on this is an important
moment
saved saved
yeah you just completely lost my train
of thought to be honest with you good
time to hydrate i think
i don't think i left a trinket behind
anywhere
so i don't know we'll we'll figure it
out
either way um what was it always talking
about mlb oh yeah okay i remember what i
was talking about
i know that i will stream it
and then jay don't let this be a
cautionary tale i think we got different
uh
demographics you left the matchstick
behind oh thank god thank you thank you
i will stream it once
uh the analytics will be good for
half an hour and then terrible
and it will be endlessly uh
not not to be like too negative but
people being like
i don't understand the rules of baseball
um
and also i hate sports and then
know i'll be having fun with it but
it'll also be like poison for my twitch
channel so i think we'll probably play
it maybe a couple of times
and then that might be it but
i've accepted you know you you can't
always get what you want
i i'm i'm happy to you know stream more
isaac during my uh
my show time or stuff that works well on
the show at least it's not exclusively
isaac
and then also uh
pardon me in my down time i can just rip
some rip some dingers uh when i get a
chance
and now do you like basketball i wish i
liked it more than i do
is the answer because i think there's a
lot to like
in basketball like i really like the
the culture that basketball has of
actually like nurturing
i i needed um some hp but that's okay
the culture that they have in basketball
of like
um nurturing superstars instead of like
in the nhl there's no superstar culture
you know you just every player gets
sanded off by
um you know media training and stuff
like that
until they just basically they have no
personality whatsoever
okay this is this is dangerous here
so i wish
this this seems horrible
just like the kick a bomb down there if
you don't mind
bro really am i am i losing it am i
insane
i just like to shoot the statue am i am
i insane
i was oh because it's an unbreakable
rock
i didn't realize i i thought we were
i thought i just placed the bomb like in
its blind spot but yeah in the nhl like
the superstars have no personality right
is really what it comes down to it's not
that they have no personalities that
they're you know
trained and conditioned to have no
personality so they don't
you know during an interview say what
they really think instead they just
say oh you know we're going to go give
110 i appreciate that that
basketball goes in like the opposite
direction i think it's it's
a better look for sports that they uh
they let people's personalities shine
instead of just like you know he's my
favorite player because he shoot the
puck a little
come on man come on i'm giving it all up
here
so i wish i liked basketball but i just
don't enjoy watching the sport
that much
that's what it comes down to
it is hard to get into new sports
that was like almost my death
what about college basketball i do like
the idea that in college basketball
um you get these like crazy cinderella
stories but that's all i know about it
more or less again it's kind of like the
same thing
for me just i i don't derive as much
enjoyment from watching it
which is probably just because i didn't
grow up watching it but
it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy
yeah plus i don't know enough about
american colleges
[Laughter]
so i don't know who to root for i just
end up becoming that caricature of like
i just hope that
i've never heard of any of these teams
but i hope the worst one wins
okay we're living that's decent
doesn't matter who gets that
you grab that
i bought it as the wrong character i
bought it as the wrong character
you know what's the worst part is that
in my head i was like
oh like i don't know i thought i bought
a red heart but i guess not
and then uh i was like whatever
i'll just buy the spirit heart instead
mission failed successfully i i mean i'm
just going to own up to it like
it's my bad for one but if we uh
if we don't get
a red heart the odds of us beating
the final boss or the any boss on this
floor really not not just the
quote-unquote final boss
is essentially zero so
we might as well do our best to look for
a red heart
um
oh there is no boss till home
but yes uh the long and short of it is i
am excited for mlb the show
can't let me in there huh okay oh no no
hold on i got all sorts of ideas that
you
you wouldn't understand
they're from canada
good good spirit hearts he's actually
cracked he's a genius and then you
emperor out
the emperor
okay he's a god all this just to unlock
a version of this character that i'm
sure is just gonna be harder right
i'm in the corner watching you kiss her
oh actually way harder oh
sick sick
oh no i haven't watched for a couple of
days what the heck's going on
it's just isaac man you don't have to be
so concerned about it you get the idea
loving the robin references i mean i
don't know that much robin
honestly but i do know that song and
that song is like as a classic
i know that she has short hair so we
have that in common
and then also she's swedish isn't that
weird
definitely still wanted
okay we we did leave it trinket so we
should be good
that song got big everywhere except in
america
so the uh oh and canada i guess but
um the the first media event i ever went
to
was paradoxcon 2013
in reykjavik iceland i just remember
like one of the
events like after hours was like hey
we're going to like this
icelandic uh nightclub i just remember
like sitting
at a table with like a bunch of nerds
like myself
watching like two people in the group
dance
uh while the rest of us were just like
what are we doing here
don't get me wrong it was nice of
paradox to do it
but it was also like i think it's one of
those things i don't know if it if it's
like a cultural difference but like in
north america like
nerds don't dance in fact just in
general
i i don't want to i don't say like
categorically but like
the the culture here is for the most
part guys don't like to dance and
especially if they're
if they're big dorks i feel like in
europe i just have this perception that
like everybody's like
you know even the most like
straight-laced computer programmer type
or whatever
is just like yeah i can dance we go to
the like you have
more of like a discotheque sort of
culture and
and stuff like that
i don't know i could that's just wrong
it's fair enough like i was
basing it on essentially nothing at all
i guess
distressingly false oh okay
not in austria no not in austria because
every time you go to the
the clubs they're just playing mozart
right they're playing like some
harpsichord
it's like a wes anderson movie in there
that's that's a long time recurring bit
which is one of the only things i know
about austria is that mozart's from
there
but that's i think that was the first
time i heard dancing on my own by robin
and even while i was sitting there
sitting on my own and not dancing at all
i was like oh yeah this song's a bop you
know that that
uh meme that's like uh
oh yeah this is doing numbers when you
tweet something and it's not doing
numbers and it's just the guy
like illuminated by his uh computer
monitor
that's like me listening to
good dance music that's like me
listening to annie
i'm like oh yeah this is very danceable
in theory at least
okay all we gotta do like we're not
gonna beat
the super boss let's be realistic all we
gotta do is
is make it home get some red hearts
got to do something there you go well
done
this would be a great time for book of
the dead can of corn and i'll be all
right
okay so i have been watching falcon in
the winter soldier it's just it's just
come up no
let's just come up and chat um i haven't
seen the new episode yet i ran out of
time yesterday between all those
aforementioned post office shenanigans
i have been enjoying the show decently
so far i'm in a bit and it's not like a
huge
crisis but i'm in like a bit of a
like a marvel pinch right now
where when i saw the first few episodes
of wine division i was like
whoa what's going on this is like kind
of weird
and then now i'm watching falcon and i
thought the one division got better as
it went along
the less it adhered to the joke um get
it get it get it
uh but then like uh
falcon and the winter soldier i'm more
i'm watching it and i'm going like
it's almost like but my vibe after the
first three episodes
or two episodes i can't remember how
deep we're in i think we're three
we're just we're in four but i haven't
seen it yet okay so the first three
episodes i've been watching and i've
been like
it's almost a little marvelly for me
which i what do you expect
for sure
get me out but i do
like uh daniel bruhl i think he's it uh
almost as much as as steve bruhl
he's i think he's quite charismatic
not marvelly enough for the marvel club
marvel marvel
you should watch invincible i don't know
what that is but i've seen a lot of
people
tweeting about it so this this is your
chance
this is your chance to to pitch me on
whatever it is
what is invincible
it's a cartoon all right i'm out
you're you're a con artist
get out of here it's
it's a cartoon kind of like the boys hey
i'm
okay with cartoons didn't you hear me
talk up the simpsons
i was talking up the simpsons
all i want to watch right now is that we
work documentary
but whenever something comes out on hulu
in the united states of america
it's impossible to tell what it comes
out on in canada is it crave
is it amazon prime is it netflix is it
like it just no matter what it comes out
or
no matter how easy it is to get in
america in canada you got to go on like
a wild goose chase just to find it
same with the uk yeah i hear you
yeah sometimes it just doesn't exist
like i don't know if we ever got the
second
fire festival documentary everyone was
like which one do you like more and i'm
like the netflix one because they don't
have the hulu one here
and then they're like the hulu one is
way better
oh you're missing out
done okay you got something for me you
got something for me i don't want it
well i think we're at least gonna unlock
the tainted version of the character
anything past that is just gravy
and that's why a lot of people choose to
sail the high seas are
maybe yeah that's like the reason
that they say for sure
the reason that they feel in their heart
of hearts i think it's uh
please let me i need this i've never
seen dark bomb be this
disappointing for me
i think it's uh that it's is free
that's that's i know it's a slightly
controversial take
there's some high-minded ideals for it
but i think it's uh
i think the big selling factor is like
that it's free
you know what on this room i give you my
permission to take these
i know i'm not even worried about like
it's not even the payout ratio of uh
of uh dark bum it's actually just that
he keeps getting to the red hearts
before i do because
my brain is like you know ossified or
whatever
from from being so freaking old
why does esau only have six items he
knows what he did
he will be ashamed of his words and his
deeds control
q yeah yeah yeah okay
you got calcium deposits on all your
joints
we're gonna focus on building some real
hurting power
that's from rocky balboa the
third best rocky movie
never seen it if you're not into the
you know the idea of a sports movie like
that
then there's no reason to watch it but
if you've enjoyed
the rocky uh formula in the past
it's a it's a i think it's an underrated
rocky honestly
saved
i can't believe we made it back to
formula
back to formula
yeah one is great i remember like
almost nothing about two i think it's
essentially a rehash
three is not very good four
is either terrible or fantastic
depending on the mood that you're in
he's done it you unlock jacob
red redemption please don't tell me you
have to get
esau as well i'll be so upset
um
and then uh like five i've never even
i think i've only seen part of it
but balboa is one that has you would
expect it to be bad
because it's comical like the idea that
like a 60 year old sylvester stallone
could hang in the ring with like a
uh
with a contemporary boxer of a younger
age
but here's the thing they kind of like
you know they thought of that
creed's i haven't seen creed one i think
yet i've only seen creed too
i thought creed 2 was was um
i thought it was fine
certainly better than bad maybe a little
less than great i don't know what you
i don't know what you want me to do
there because my my dudes are too
separated
but i feel like that's always the the
problem oh
okay fair enough i'm still happy with
that run but
the problem with the rocky movies is
like sylvester stallone he keeps going
back to the well
right like rocky one is unbelievable so
he's like okay let's make five more of
those
with diminishing returns on them and
then he's like we're gonna reboot the
franchise with rocky balboa and that
that was pretty good and then creed did
the exact same thing and he's like well
then we gotta do a creed too and i'm
like
you you're just gonna go until you make
the bad one and then you're gonna have
to restart it again from the
anyway but i do like them i'm a sucker
for sports movies
unlock pog



and we are ready to um
lose a lot don't look at that win streak
that's that's youtube's win streak
you're not allowed to see that jacob
doesn't touch it
we basically any kind of ending that we
could get to as
jacob and esau who i'm just gonna call
jake from now on
because it seems like i mean like i get
that they're not
named jacob and jacob but it kind of
maybe they could be like jay and
jake you know what i mean no all right
weak start to the bits this week but
it's all right because i'm the master of
diagonal walking um
check this out dude
paul in chat can we touch this without
getting hit
[Laughter]
magnificent
on youtube i wouldn't have tried it i
don't think i would have tried it but
with an audience you know it leads to
some riskier behavior
sometimes and every now and then it
works out you know
i can't believe it
heading down to the next level here
heading down to the item room
um scapular
i one of these days like it's been in
the game for a decade i
still don't really know what it does but
we'll figure it out
you know you don't need to know that
that's a mimic by the way yeah you don't
need to know the caliber
of the item you just need to know the
sound it makes when it takes a man's
life
i am excited for today's show by the way
um i thought about no lifeing
repentance like because like here's the
here's the deal i only know the
the opening part of this week okay well
that's not true i know
some of it so i thought about no life in
repentance
because i'm like oh tomorrow we're gonna
do repentance
plus uh a little bit of rainbow six with
the lads
so today i could get away with playing
five hours of repentance
knowing that we'd introduce some variety
tomorrow but then i thought to myself
what what would
old you think
of the fact that they released a new
tetris 99 style game
and you're not gonna like check it out
right
around the time of its release like it's
that sacrilegious
so we're gonna we're gonna play some
pac-man 99 i don't know if we're gonna
play an hour
90 minutes two hours but we're we're
gonna play some pac-man 99
i have played probably 45 minutes off
camera
and have not won so you have not really
missed
uh much of anything at all i'd say
check the shop always check the shop
there's some other games on my list as
well don't get me wrong
but for now i mean like friday i don't
know if i even told
people um
let's try it man let's fricken try it i
don't know if i even told people but on
friday we're doing uh
a pummel party twitch rivals
[Laughter]
i don't know a hundred percent of the
cast
all i'm saying is i know chib's gonna be
there
and i also told chib
to ask lil nos x in the dms
if he would be interested in joining us
now do i think that the odds of that
coming to pass are are high no
but it would be hilarious there's no
doubt about that that it would be funny
funny
okay okay dude that's a combination of
pretty good items there
i'm not upset yeah so i know
like me chib
mouth justin
and jay and paws
how many people is that that's six
people right
it's an elite squad oh the only thing we
need to round it out
is lil nos x if we could just get lil
nos x to join us i think it would be the
it would be the perfect the perfect vibe
i really think that that he would fit in
nicely with that group
a stacked squad can you guys get closer
together please thank you
you shouldn't be able to make this many
flies there's too many flies
it's too many damn pages for any sane
man to understand
really i don't know why like i'm looking
at this like i'm indignant come on
booster pack
three never mind six cards
for killing a boss
disrespectful insubordinate you know
where i'm going with this
no okay it's actually i have i there was
no reason to get mad
um because telepills was actually not
that bad but i don't know it just threw
me for a loop
i don't have i don't have an explanation
emotionally i i felt a little shattered
there okay let's see what we got
the tower here's what you do with that
stomp it oh he got the tower dump it
maybe we can at least get some access
there
um
and then two of spades okay
it's not bad two of spades it's not bad
the empress who cares justice we use
injustice
what if the killer
from the new saw movie is
uh jim parsons who played
sheldon on the big bang theory you ever
think about this sort of stuff
perhaps a little bit more h2so4
well by your zynga captain
just just thoughts that have been
percolating in my head lately
because they are they made that new saw
movie right it comes i saw the trailer
can i hit you with a tank that you're
going to like this is like a dan
take but i kind of believe it
this is andy i i would like to be clear
it's from post
2004 only okay so like
longer than most of the people in chat
have been alive but still
not from the 90s and also not from the
movie
uh changing lanes the 2003 film changing
lanes
samuel l jackson uh and ben affleck
great movie
fantastic movie however
if and this is not it's a hard and fast
rule but you don't have to live by it
if i see samuel l jackson
in the trailer for a movie and there's
no superheroes in it
the odds of that movie in my head of
being good
go down to near zero there is a couple
of exceptions
and i got nothing against samuel l
jackson
there's a couple of exceptions the other
guys is one of the best comedies of the
2010s
no question um
that's true if in if samuel l jackson
plus tarantino
also equals uh it it nullifies the
law jackson's law
you've redeemed this opinion with that
addendum thank you bear i appreciate
i put thought into this and i'm open to
the idea of you know
adjusting the theory over time
kingsman
he's not in kingsman is he
such a weird time for that reference
because i referenced
the kingsman 2 the golden circle today
in the context of explaining how someone
might uh
make themselves familiar with elton john
oh in the first movie is the villain
yeah and you know what he does a really
good job
he he's good in that movie there's no
question there um
bro i don't know man like so what
happens if you take dark judas hello
bear taffy by the way
what happens if you take dark judas
and then could you have
jacob and dark judas and then still get
the
jacob and esau stuff probably not i
don't think so
so i think i'm going to ignore
everything and try to cultivate some
deals with the angel instead
my other bit from today was i posited
that nobody knows the lyrics to benny
and the jets
even uh elton so every time he sings the
song live he just sings whatever is like
on his mind
he's like he's got a moldy shoe
a handbag too you know we read it in the
quarterly
oh benny and the jets
okay hold on this i mean this is amazing
please don't sing you should look at the
new chat rules i
honestly i could get you incarcerated
for that take
and i wouldn't hesitate to do so uh my
brain
is broken i was like how does one do
this
hold on we don't even want to do it this
way just give it just give it a sec just
give it a sec
okay here's how it looks
you sidle up to it like this
this would be a great time to have a key
dude this would be a wonderful time
to have a key okay
look at that look at that and it was
worth it it was well worth it
two very good items
anyway that's that's my thoughts on all
things random so far
hey annel can you speak up i can't hear
you over my air fryer
all right you know what um that is
something i have
neglected hitherto to touch upon when it
comes to the air fryer
it is loud it is a loud
appliance i like it
in fact i might even say i love it but
it it do be loud
i i'm gonna go back for dirty mind by
the way i forgot that it's actually uh
pickupable i still wanna pick up dirty
mind
oh yeah you know
you know what i'm talking about steely
dan
i'd sherlock to pick up dirty mind
oh yeah
opinion on right hold on
opinion on rocket man
the movie or the song i have not
seen the movie um
the song i think is
good you're gonna and this is a great
item by the way i'm very happy to see
this
i do think is a little indulgent it's a
little long
i think that's one of those songs where
if he didn't have radio constraints they
could have just made it like
first verse chorus chorus and then ended
and it would have been fine
i i do think it's still a good song
though
okay so i'm gonna i am gonna
try to do alt path you never know how
it's gonna work out but
uh i'm gonna try
so yeah the the item we got i can't
remember what it's called it's like
buffet or something
um essentially
every item pedestal will over time
alternate with an hp upgrade
saved so any item pedestal
you have a choice between the item
pedestal
what's on it i should say and an hp
upgrade which is actually
really really nice um
for ensuring that you have enough hp to
survive like this is a really good
example i think
of a situation where you would look at
this and be like you know one of the
main reasons i die in repentance is not
having
i literally just bought ventricular
razor instead um
i am going to turn into the joker
if you don't mind if you'll excuse me
i'm going to become the joker
um i mean like the thing is
ventricular razor's like actually pretty
sick
but the odds of me using it when i
already have to like
split my brain in the eighths
just to understand what's happening is
like it's pretty low
it's not bad because you can get inside
of
i mean this is not amazing i guess but
you can get inside of rooms and then get
out of the room
uh we want jacob to take it jacob
touches it
uh like you can get inside of a mob trap
room or a boss trap room steal the item
and then leave do you like
aphex twin uh i do
for for a year like the year that i
lived in south korea
i would fall asleep uh whenever i had
insomnia to selected ambient works
vol 2
it's just it's got the ex the right kind
of vibe to just send you off to
dreamland
uh and then you know i like some of the
some of the apex twin stuff that's not
ambient as well
i wish the milkman would deliver my milk
in the morning okay you no no
look i know we got experimental
treatment and we could possibly work
towards spun we will not be doing that
i was thinking about that the other day
man like i've been getting into like
uh brian eno's ambient works because i
really do think like
like music for airports is maybe my
favorite ambient album of all time
um but i forgot like ryan eno's just
like a really good like
rock star pop star as well
like here come the warm jets and uh
let's just i forget the the the first
album
do we never talk shop about this you're
blowing my mind
brian eno's the business dude i'm all
about that kind of stuff you know me
same old g there's there's here come the
warm jets and then there's uh what's
what's the other one i'm trying to think
of you know what i'm talking about
he's getting another green world that's
what it's i'll find a place out there
in the valley i'm gonna sleep for the
rest of my days
you know what i'm talking about yeah
we're going down right
someday my dear bro love is gonna put me
through that garden gate
you know but dude that came up on like
youtube music shuffle the other day i
hadn't heard that song since probably
like my first year of university and i
was like dude this is
i forgot how pog this was
anyway that's all i got
[Laughter]
that's that's my thoughts on music
pretty much got it figured out
no it's not all my thoughts on music
because malf reminded me yesterday
of froggy fresh also known as krispy
kreme
and then i linked him because i i've
maintained
that his halloween song has no reason to
go as hard as it does i linked him to
halloween one
um and i was like this goes hard and
then i listened to it and i was like no
this is not the right song
then i linked him to halloween too
because that's the one i was originally
thinking of that
freaking it's so grimy dude like who
gave krispy kreme
permission to to get that dirty you know
i am going home without my candy
and my homie
it's crazy man
i saw him in concert it was sick
i wonder if i could book him to sing a
song when i get vaccinated
about getting vaccinated
in five months hey yeah i mean like i
yeah it's
hey shut up you're right though um no
probably like
probably two months two months and a
half maybe is my guess
okay i'm gonna pop it i'm not afraid
we want jacob to not grab this
emperor card okay now this is pog
we're good we're good best thing about
this run right now
is that we have a copious
supply there's no more bombs coming huh
oh they they spawn from the the mine
carts
we have a copious supply of of demon
hearts and
spirit hearts it's making life much
easier
a little little tight up through the
corner here beautiful throw
could have been better could have been
better i mean we have bombs there's no
reason to get so finicky with it
and that's exactly why we got it okay
you're toasted oh come on you're toasted
don't take my this is exactly what we
want okay angel deal
the relic has been nerfed but it's still
much better i bet if we
beat up the angel statue though okay
hold on this could actually go man
it's not quite that impressive yet but
just give it a minute
majestic because we we definitely need
this because i bet i bet we'll get a key
piece
or an hp upgrade and that i would
definitely take the opportunity to get
another hp
upgrade so i don't care who gets the
relic
i do know
uh that's you know look all things
considered
it's not that bad but the relic
definitely would have been better
you won't you won't find me trying to
run too much defense on that one
hey war god devil 2.
thanks for the gift of subscriptions
this is over and above
the call of duty in terms of generosity
thank you
much appreciated that this runs for you
i i knew we were gonna get hit
just the the spiky rocks there was there
was a limited chance of getting out of
there for me
you know why you're right i i've
forgotten about shooting all the poos to
get two pals
now this this is seraphim
is worth it particularly because
we know we're going to get
hp we're going to get so much hp that
items that are
that's also really good with infamy but
items that are
as good as this need to be taken
i also i'm gonna go ahead and tell you
with with
all sincerity on planet earth
rotten hearts are like some of the most
valuable items you can actually get
let me out oh god
being able to get all these flies is is
extremely helpful
that's you're chilling we're just
chilling man i'm like mojel and i'm so
jealous
that is true i have to remember they're
only half a heart but
you know every juice has its squeeze
brett michaels okay blue candle
or hp i think we definitely want to do
a blue candle and i have absolutely no
problem
picking this up on the unit that has
like ventricular razor
and i don't even want to keep
ventricular razor i know that there's
here's the thing is it the right idea
yeah probably but the flip side is
i think you have to reduce your decision
load
and i think for many people in chat as
well you might want to reduce your load
decision
just throwing that out there but we're
just trying to make the run as
as smooth as possible the less decisions
we have to make
the less ambient brain power
is wasted on things that are relatively
minor
the more we can focus on that which
actually matters
friends and family etc etc
selected ambient brain power volume two
dude that'd be a great bit what if you
just went live and you're like yo
my favorite aphex twin song it's the one
is is this one you ready
that's a good it's called distant
lighthouse
it echoes the sound of uh a lighthouse
over a
a foggy bay it took 14 years to make
and for some reason it i it moves me to
tears every time i hear it
[Laughter]
okay this is one i in my opinion we just
want hp
to double oh that makes sense if you get
one hp it would be two hp
no i haven't seen the lighthouse yet i
know i i know i should
instead i watched uh six episodes of
season eight of the simpsons
on on saturday and honestly like i
forgot
i've i've you know lost
so much favor for that show i forgot
that it's actually like one of the best
shows ever made
i i became ashamed of my words and my
beats
over the course of uh over the course of
watching it
like the episode i mean that and i
didn't pick these episodes on purpose
but
it was the uh it's the season that has
the one where milhouse's parents get uh
divorced
it's dignity luanne
don't you want me to talk i'll do you
want me to tell a story i'll tell a
story about a guy who inherited his
dad's cracker factory
then turned it from the number one
cracker factory
in springfield into a tie for sixth
place below
allied biscuits i want more hp man
that's the
that's the dream here
oh yeah when he gets fired from the
cracker factory
so that's it after 20 years all i get is
goodbye and good luck
i don't recall saying good luck it's a
good this is a great show
or uh it also has i don't know why this
made me laugh so hard
but like when lisa falls in love with
nelson
muntz and then she goes to his house and
there's the nuke the whales poster and
then
she's like surely you don't believe that
and he's like ah you gotta nuke
something
and then he sings the song this like
joy to the world the teacher's dead
we barbecued her head
what happened to her body we flushed it
down the potty and round and round it
goes
i'm like man this is i think i was
trying i was talking about it a little
in the isaac episode today but i was
trying to explain like
i think it it it hits you more as you
get older
because you realize like
it's not the kid's fault you know
if that makes sense
because i'm like you know when you're a
kid you're like ah that's funny he's
like saying bad words
as an adult you're like oh man it's
funny because like his parents are
negligent
and if you if you don't laugh you'd cry
some good episode it was also the one
where like um
the simpsons uh
or the springfield gets gets hit by a
hurricane and only ned flanders house
gets destroyed so he undergoes like a
severe crisis of faith
this is with with the classic quote um
you know we tried nothing and we're all
out of ideas
safe confirmed safe
did you see the not the gift of the
video
that that uh edmund retweeted of like
this is me running away from mom when i
get the second knife piece
and i'm i'm pretty sure it's from a
piece of adult entertainment but with
like some photoshopping done on it
oh my god no ah no
it's it's so good
oh man yeah when their house uh is
destroyed and they're like
uh don't worry i'm sure insurance will
cover it and they're like oh nettie
doesn't believe in insurance he
considers it a form of gambling
simpson's movie i i saw it in theaters
and have not seen it since but
i do recall it being way better
than i could have expected given that
the simpsons were already in like a
heavy decline
and had been for like a decade at that
point
i knew that i was thank god we got so
much hp man
dude i'm sorry that apparently this is
just gonna be like simpsons quotes but
uh
when he's like he's leaving kirk van
houden is living in the singles living
uh
center and he opens the door and they're
like that's jerry he's a big player down
at the sewing store
okay i think i think we're ready to go i
think we're ready to leave
i just realized like every uh
every simpsons episode that season is
actually a classic like there were a
couple
episodes i thought maybe i just got like
two in a row that were really good
and then uh it was like oh now it's the
one where like bart goes to
work at the burlesque house and i was
like this one's a classic too
and then it's the one where like marge
opens a a pretzel
wagon and like
yeah we're going down the alt path man
then homer like
gets her in with the mob so that her
business doesn't fail and i'm like this
is a great one too
it's all they're all classic
okay the mausoleum i'm gonna i'm just
gonna go ahead and say it
actually the hardest floor in this game
harder than the corpse
this this floor is a is is a disaster
for me
we got bombs
melee enemies are are insanely annoying
no doubt about that
this one might be a run where we have to
just pivot off of this we'll see what
our hp looks like after this floor
but uh if we do
i'm stupid if we do i will leave a
trinket behind
wait we don't have a trinket i don't
know what i'm gonna do then
yeah i'm like honestly like it it
completely justifies
the purchase price um get me out of uh
of disney plus for me right now i know
people are gonna be like oh he's
cropped wrong or whatever you know so
you can
so be it you know you could buy the
blu-rays if you want
don't let me stop you
press pause and check the toe the posted
note i'm here to tell you
um i need just about everything as this
character so
for the time being there's no need
how do you feel about steamed hands i
mean that the the episode that steamed
hams comes from is one of my
favorite episodes even before steamed
hams was that it was a heavy meme
like 17 short films about springfield or
whatever it's called that's like
it was the patrician's choice for for
top episode
okay charges we don't care about what we
do care about
living
hp please thank you
what about man gets hit by football it's
i mean
like maybe it's a controversial take
maybe this is the point of the episode
to begin with i haven't seen it you know
since i was like
11. um
man gets hit and growing by football is
better than barney's
needlessly um pretentious
drivel man gets hit by football deserve
to win at the film festival
and i'm glad it did
interesting delightful
magnificent of course i'm gonna do it
don't reroll my knife i'll be extremely
furious
um you can now take hp to stay alive
and i was told there was a tinted rock
and you're absolutely right there is
and round and round it goes and round
and
round it goes
yeah it only rerolled one character
and honestly the re-roll seems kind of
doo-doo
but you know the fact that you get
infinite rerolls
or as many as you can muster at least
it uh changes the game changes the game
in a big way
dd mega doo doo
i don't know if you take the knife
pieces
as uh the wrong character like if you
take one as jacob and one is esau
my hunch is based on isaac's design in
the past
that it it'll screw you that's my take
on it
um they combine even if you take them is
that's amazing
incredible
i like it hey annel how was your day off
bro it was jam-packed all right so get
this i don't know if you're ready for
this kind of like
the lifestyle i lead a lot of people
would they they honestly
they'd be begging to go to the cottage
like
by hour too because they can't handle
this so get this all right
i had to go to the post office yesterday
i woke up at 6 45 a.m
just because that's what it's like um
i had to go to the post office yesterday
right
figured the post office opened around
nine went by the post office saw that it
didn't open
until noon what's up with that dude so i
came back at 11
40 and i was standing in line for the
post office because i wanted to be first
because you know you know you want to
beat the rush
and then while i was standing in line
the manager of the store
came by and posted over the hours of the
post office
he posted li open today two to five
and i said what happened and he said oh
we had someone call in sick
and i said i mean don't get me wrong
it's a good precaution to take but like
i'm all
this is my second time at the post
office already
and now i gotta like uh i gotta come
back at two
anyway so i came back at around 3 40
and i'm like mailed that stuff
but that's not all man like that's the
end of the post office portion
but that's not the end of my my action
movie day
um like i got to tell you
we took the baby out for a walk get this
you ready for this
it was like really windy so we came back
inside because it was honestly so cold
that we were worried the baby would be
like a little
uncomfortable so it was like a pretty
busy day
i forgot this is also the uh the d10
this is a terrible run so it was like
we got up to some stuff man
so the d10 rerolls empty rooms now huh
um
okay here i got some interest here
because jacob has become the lost
but i i think it kind of sucks actually
i think it's not good then again we
can't do anything about it so let's just
live with it well that's what i did
when i said he became the lost that's
what i meant is not that he became the
last
i duh believe you didn't read between
the lines on that one all right time to
suffer through this undodgeable wave of
attacks
and hit you with uh an infinite number
of bombs and
still live still live okay we don't get
hp as an option anymore that's fine
we're really just trying to get a single
charge
what the heck are you just keep moving
as long as you keep moving you can't be
hurt
one of these days if we keep rolling i
got a lot of faith i'm not concerned
so anyway oh yeah it's good it's good
we got the mind this doesn't seem too
bad
hp is a little low but it doesn't seem
too bad
can of corn baby can of corn
uh you know we're probably gonna re-roll
you so let's take the hp on the unit
that has some level of
object permanence yo we got godhead and
like
either x placebo or or
mucor mycosis or whatever the heck this
item is called
okay dude you can look at that look at
that greatest end of my life
not to mention we got spilled milk it's
incredible
um i forgot what i was talking about
that was my whole day
basically
do you like chapman's cinderella what is
that like an ice cream flavor
chapman's chapman cinderella
i have no idea what that is
it's a cologne
i don't know i i i don't have an answer
i and i have i've stalled out completely
i got nothing for you i don't know what
you want from me
the lions like from the circus
and they were playing a game i'm just
trying to understand here
it's a song bro i don't know anything
about songs
my favorite recording artist for the
last 10 years um
pete davidson
that should tell you everything you need
to know
pete webber oh now we're talking okay i
always use this
on empty rooms i'm learning
did i just reroll godhead yeah i just
rerolled godhead you know why
so we have something even better than
godhead
the brimstone that ruins your game
completely it's actually really good
it's actually unbelievable
don't shoot me with the beam
okay and we got an angel room as well
hold on this this run could actually do
it
you definitely want both i don't think
we reroll man
i think we just try to get some degree
of survivability
on our other character
also known as jacob also known as the
main character
we don't care for a key piece
okay that hurts this run has got a
chance though
being a oh we should have gone second
secret room but uh oh
every time man just being able to swap
the items would be enough
and also i'm gonna need a new keyboard
after this but you know what
it is what it is
good tanking thank you esau good tanking
thank you did you see my anecdote by the
way on uh
that's not how i meant to do that you
see my anecdote on twitter i got some
coffee
and the um the barista said here's your
coffee and i said thanks you
very painful it was very painful for me
freaking idiot
 you're donkey that's not how it's
said
what if we just rerolled this run again
though time to find her new coffee shop
what did she say oh i mean she probably
forgot about it like 10 seconds after it
happened but
but it that's not the important part the
important part is it's going to stick
with me for life
you know the old m bison strategy
we'll see maybe next time i go in
they'll be like hey you know last time
you were here you said thanks you
instead of thank you like what was up
with that and i'll be like oh that was
my
twin brother who
doesn't know english
a common misconception
look at this yeah they got me up on the
wall
like i'm not allowed to go back into the
store what the heck
i actively avoid a shop because of a
dumb thing i did several years ago
i think it depends what the dumb thing
is
like i would never not show up to a
coffee shop because i said
thanks you
that's a little too far um
i'm trying to think of even what would
it take i don't know it would take a lot
i knocked over a gamestop display once
i oh no um just roll it man you got it
you need the hp
it didn't work good night control space
held up name a woman
it's still really good we just need to
survive oh
no no no
there's a button and everything it's
i could



we gotta try
i mean we did jacob yesterday who's the
kane don't even get me started okay
it's tinted judas right that has uh
that has the the katana
yeah okay we're doing katana strats
dolce and katana
we'll do some tainted cane don't get me
wrong either like i
i actually think tainted kane might be
like my favorite
character in the game
you guys are are you okay you're like
you're too fast man
it's too big for you i gotta watch that
that was one of my favorite viral videos
i haven't seen it in forever
guy in large car actually parks
correctly but gets yelled at by lady who
parked her toyota yaris over the lines
it's too big for you
it's a good video
tainted lilith is cool too
no trolling you're invincible in dark
form
we do a little trolling though
did you see the clip of the lady
freaking out over someone's pet pig
i did not i'll watch it
any video that is in the genre of public
freakout
i'll i'll give it a try at least
there's been a lot of vancouver ones man
no doubt about that
like vancouver might as well be like
it's a home game for our slash public
out lately uh kovid denyer gets bicycle
thrown in through his passenger side
window
um there's there's all sorts of them
no i wouldn't say vancouver's like the
florida of canada
like honestly i think it's kind of like
canada's los angeles
so you know you you get
i mean what do you want me to say you
get a cosmopolitan cross-section of
of society
you know how like in grand theft auto uh
five
you'll be walking down the street and
then like within five seconds three
different strangers will make you
make your head spin with what they're
saying to you that's pretty much what
it's like
good damage really really good and smart
damage here thank you for reminding me
we can
go into the curse room for free thank
you
what is canada's florida i mean the
funny
answer is florida like a lot of
canadians
especially like after they retire
they they go live in florida or arizona
increasingly
let's do it let's do it
yeah like that's it's kind of like the
the wealthy canadian retirement plan for
a lot of people is like they have one
house in canada that you summer in
and then in the winter you go down to
like your house in florida or in
in flagstaff so that you uh
in the wintertime you don't have to deal
with the snow
and then you say something like oh it's
not that i wanted to own two houses it's
just that you know
my joints something like that
anyway
we got hp we're chilling this we got to
get some more momentum i've thrown some
hp away i'm not proud of but we'll get
it back we were just a little heavy on
the banter there
i thought maybe i could like drag it out
it's nice in canada right now at least
in um
in vancouver it's nice right now it's
sunny but a little chilly but the geese
are hanging out but it's before most of
them
have had their uh their goslings
so they're not crazy yet which is nice
you get to walk around you'll see some
geese like you know drinking some water
out of a puddle or something like that
and you're like that's cool
but then when they have their goslings
they go freaking crazy
if you're like i get scared sometimes
when i'm walking around and i see
somebody walking their dog and the dog
goes close to the goose i'm like get the
heck out of the
out of the way like get your dog out of
there it's too big for you
um that's pretty good it's not good at
all
actually excuse me i've been ripped off
that was fruitcake that's right
what the
we don't want it it's too big for you
that's all i got yeah geese i don't know
but i maintain you know the thing is
like
um people say like geese are
a-holes i think the only reason that we
see them as a-holes is because they're
one of the few
uh animals that stands up to human
hegemony
no thank you no no thank you like if you
go up to if there's like a fly
or something like that and you go like
get out of here the fly's like oh
crap get me out of here
if you go up to a pigeon or a seagull
and you try to scare it
like they're they're gonna get scared in
all likelihood if you go up to a goose
and you're like
i'm the i'm the dominant species on this
planet they're like oh really
let's put that theory to the test
i respect it honestly you you learn
really quickly like as a kid you learn
that's a bird that's not to be trifled
with
are you stealing my you're stealing my
consumable or my item
yeah the geese they they're they're
chilling man i thought i could go over
the gaps with this
they are horrible creatures they make
the docks and the parks such a mess
wait are you talking about people or
geese look i'm not a geese
guy like i'm not gonna go to bed for the
geese but i'm like
you know they i mean they do poop on
everything they create a lot of poop
but i don't know what to say you know
like i can't really say like it's their
fault
you know what are they supposed to do
fly into the toilet
i mean we kind of took the goose world
away from them so i think
it's well within their rights to
to defecate as they please plus i mean
and this is
you know again canada's los angeles sort
of thing but
i see human excrement on a
semi-regular basis in the city so
i mean this is like a little too gross
there's definitely like one time caden i
went to a
a baby doctor appointment and the
literally like the parking spot that we
parked in there was uh
like a human had like taken a dump in a
sweatshirt
and placed it in the parking lot i was
just like
all right i don't know i guess i just
don't understand like why you had to
ruin your sweatshirt
to to do it but then also like um
we were walking the uh this was like a
month ago now that i think about it but
we were walking and
uh there was just a
human poo on the on the sidewalk
well it was like in the grass next to
the sidewalk
uh and it was next to like some old
plastic bags and stuff like that
and i honestly like look i know it
grosses people out i'm not really
worried about human feces right now
we're doing a lot of diaper changes
but uh i
i saw the poo and i was actually like
jealous because at one point i was like
i'm not
jealous because like i don't know what
that person did to like get to the point
where they're taking a poop on the
street
but like it was so like
solid and it looked so healthy that i
almost had like a medical
envy for it i was like what is this
person eating
that their their excrement came out so
like it it looked like the the 3d
model of the perfect poop
i don't think i've had one of those
since i was like nine years old
you i mean if you saw it you probably
would not think that this bit is as
weird as you'd think it is right now
here's the oh dude oh
human poop oh that comes out of my butt
every morning but now i have to see it
with my eyes in an environment where
it's not typical oh
gross me i'm like dude what are you
eating
can i i wanted to leave like a like a
missed connection on craigslist that's
like can i
have access to your nutrition plan
because i gotta i gotta know man i think
you i think you can make a lot of money
off of that
i'll confirm that that person was built
different
i'm not apologizing i think it's a
natural human emotion
i didn't go back to like take a photo of
it i was just in passing i was like you
know
that's human poop but at the same time
i'm actually just kind of impressed
okay why not
i'm realizing and let's not take this
too far down this road
but i'm realizing that there is like a
there's an urban rural divide
right like i saw someone in chat say
people are
that live in the city are just
desensitized that's like
we were talking about it with rats
yesterday i was like i see rats like
probably you know three or four times a
week just walking around people are like
that's ridiculous
i'm like nah man it's just way of the
world you live in the city
rats human poop you come across it on
occasion
also though like the best restaurants in
the world
what did kate think when you told her
this she was she was like
ew but also you're not wrong
[Laughter]
you know she's lived in the city as well
it's not like uh
you know it's for him for her she was
just like that's gross but also you do
have a good point like
it's a it's a healthy looking poop she
might have
she might have jokingly punched me in
the arm or the shoulder
oh hello daniel you you joined on some
little brother stuff but that's okay
we're moving off of it
i was just talking about um the time
where i
was walking around and i we saw some
human excrement on the street but i was
also like
begrudgingly admiring of the the quality
of the poo
you know like the structural integrity
and the
diameter and stuff like that i was
i was impressed anyway we don't have to
go too far into it i'm just saying
you sure it wasn't from a dog look
here's what i'm gonna say all right
it might have been from a dog but if it
was from a dog i'm even more impressed
than if it was from
a human because it was like
i don't know what you want me to say
like a half of the
diameter of my forearm
it could have been from a dog i mean
there's there's big dogs out there but
hello
oh thank you
okay ah i
kate's coming in to defend the bit it
was a person that had pooped
their jeans and then had left
their their jeans with the poop at the
side of the sidewalk
can you like because chad they all live
in okay look it's
too negative i apologize many of them
have not touched grass for a while
sorry that's too negative um they're
insulated
from the grime of city living
can you explain to them that there's
nothing weird about like when you see a
poop in public being like
at least it's a healthy one
kate said kate said i see many human
poops
she said it was a perfect cylinder
oddly crazily big human poop is what
she said i mean i don't know what to
tell you if you
are not at a place in your life where
you can look at something like that and
and have a little chuckle to yourself
then
you know you know
go go country like allen jackson said
that would be much worse like if uh
if it was diarrhea for sure
anyway that's all i got
yeah at least be impressed i'm at dude
the city
we already get screwed over with like
gerrymandering and now people are trying
to tell us oh you can't even have fun
anymore
like what's up with that
bro we're already paying like 1400 bucks
uh
a square foot for real estate just just
give us a chance to breathe out here you
know we gotta we gotta find
economical ways to have a laugh now and
then
can't even enjoy a secondhand poop
anymore it's crazy
cherry
anyway yeah i don't know like if you if
you walk outside and you're like oh
is that you know poop you're gonna it's
gonna be a long life
you know something you see it sometimes
you just gotta laugh oh is that poop uh
what's going on there
you ever you know what it gets me when
i'm walking around is like sometimes
you'll just be walking around
and you'll see like a shoe
and you're always like how does that
happen man how does somebody lose like a
shoe
or a sock bless you
all right that was that was pretty good
that was pretty good
i don't think it's a murder like
i i do think that yeah probably drugs or
alcohol plays a role
but it always it throws me for a loop
sometimes when i'm walking outside and
i'm like it's just
a shoe
there were kids bringing up what there
was one time i was intoxicated and i did
leave both of my shoes behind
but again i want to say two things of my
own defense one is
leaving both shoes behind is
more normal than putting one shoe on and
leaving but secondarily it also was not
at like a
an offside venue we were hanging out in
our friend's
hotel room who was staying in the same
hotel as us
and i left my shoes in their hotel room
because in my head i was like i'll just
come down tomorrow and get them
and then in the morning they were like
hey bro your shoes are here do you want
to come get them why'd you leave them
here and i was like i don't know
you got a very good point but
at the time it made a lot of sense last
night
anyway
what the okay probably shouldn't have
just shot at the wall for no reason fair
enough
yeah thank you for i i'm look not
everybody has the
scientific curiosity and decorum to
look at uh a poo and say like wow that's
a kind of a nice one
i'm glad to hear that other people that
live in cities are like yeah we see it
on the regular
i do i think it's a combination of like
you know
having done a lot of dissections in in
university
combined with like i'm you know we're
changing like a lot of diapers right now
that's a little different because it's
like your own baby's poo
but like you know poo
it doesn't gross me out on in the
slightest
i do get startled though like sometimes
i'll be changing the
the baby's diaper and like while i'm
changing it
she'll like
like fart and i'm i get it's like a
gunshot went off next to my ear
and i'm like hey what the i'm like hey
i'm working down here
put the safety on
oh yes please do
that's fine baby hello
it's not poop it's just food
excuse me this is gaslighting i did not
stop to admire
the feces okay i admired it merely in
passing
and remarked upon it
anyway you know everybody poops that's
all i'm trying to say
in fact i mean and you know we can turn
the concern trolling on its head here
if anything you should be looking at
your own poop more often
it's it's an important uh
part of maintaining your health as an
adult is to
look at your own bowel movements and be
like
you know hey does that look normal and
if it consistently looks abnormal
you'd be like maybe we could talk to
somebody about that
that's not the same as admiring a turd
on the road okay
first off it was not on the road i was
not driving along
and saw in my peripheral vision a
prodigious poop
and then pulled over the automobile and
said get a load of this honey
we were merely walking on the sidewalk
in the vicinity of something it was
unavoidable
everybody could see it to deny it would
have been
the equivalent to a shared delusion
there's not 35 000 feet
in the air inside of a boeing 787
dreamliner and i said pilot could you
please put us down
i spy with my little eye something that
begins with p
okay it merely happened to be
in our path as we were traveling
naturally
and i won't stand for this gas lighting
please put us down i see something brown
man if i had a nickel for every time i
said that
no i do not poop in the shower i mean
that's just
i you see how quickly things get out of
control online kate is crazy
one what one drunk person
pooped their pants we had to see the
poop and now all of a sudden i'm waffle
stomping
turds down our drain every morning it's
not the case
mostly because i usually have to
defecate in the morning
and then i don't get the shower until
after dinner so like
even the timeline doesn't even match up
unfortunately
that's invincibility baby
happen yeah i know i just got here
is she being serious
[Laughter]
okay hold on
strength card i haven't been focusing on
this rum for a bit
yeah like i don't want to be a night
shower
um it's not that bad but i take it as
like you know it
it's just the most convenient thing for
our lifestyle right now uh with the baby
otherwise i would i i like to shower
early in the morning but i i've pivoted
to night showering
just because we we have a lot more free
time between like you know
seven and 11 when the baby is asleep
then
this is a hot debate that kate's getting
into right now
a night shower does make a lot of sense
because it means you're getting into
your bed
clean or as clean as possible and as a
result
maybe your sheets stay cleaner longer
but it does make my clothes
get dirtier faster
i i do wash my clothes anyway we wash
our sheets anyway but
but
it's true i don't sleep in this clothing
so i mean i should
i i think my i've never had a strong
opinion on this either way i think
uh i think both night showers and
uh and morning showers are both fine
even a mid a midday shower is like the
worst of all worlds
you get like six hours of being a little
sweaty hello
hey and then you'd like shower and then
you go to bed a little dirty as well
but um if you if you just worked out of
course you gotta
you gotta do what you gotta do i mean if
you
look don't don't let the nft haters hear
this but i think you know
if you shower or you live in a very hot
or humid environment or sorry if you
work out or you live in a hot
or humid environment i'm not going to be
mad at you for taking two showers
on the occasional day i think it's
i don't i think it's better for your
body to take a shower after a
long run than to just leave the sweat
all over yourself but also
when chest is like morning shower is
better
yeah yeah
oh no oh no she's okay we're not doing
this anymore we're trying to maintain a
positive holistic environment between
streamer and audience
all i'm gonna say there are
uh occasionally stinky sweaty people at
conventions but
they're mostly um uh mouth fans
my my viewers historically have had uh
wonderful hygiene i've always been like
i i've complimented some viewers on
occasion remember there was a guy at pax
who was like hey can you pose like we're
having
like a rap uh we're doing a wrap cover
or something like that
and then when he shook my hand it was
like the strongest handshake i've ever
received in my entire life
and i was like oh my god you're so
strong
and then i looked at his forearms and
they were like almost as big as that poo
that we saw on the sidewalk
and i was like i was like what do you
eat
anyway see so that's the anatomy of a
good joke i would say
is the callback thank you thank you
i don't think that guy was trying to
hurt my hand either he just seemed like
one of those guys who was like
he's just uh he went to sfu
i don't even understand the joke the
joke is all about mim maxing how to
go to business oh oh i see and they go
when you do business you give them a
firm shake i
i am pr first off i have a couple of
things to say one is
i don't think enough people in chat are
invested in the
the vancouver university rivalry between
university of british columbia and simon
fraser university
and then secondarily i don't think that
business school teaches you how to have
a good handshake
maybe at the the mixers afterwards but
i thought sfu was a high school
no i just thought i would pile on
although i don't really the irony is
that the school that i went to for
programming when people decided that
they like wanted to get serious
oftentimes they're like yeah i'm
dropping out i got into sfu for computer
science
so i don't know if you're making fun of
sfu i don't know what the heck
you know bcit is all about oh i
shouldn't have been here
yet but that's okay we'll be fine
i think it's mostly like bcit as a
reputation as like a
a night school and a commuter school so
people that go there like aren't going
for any kind of
university experience they're they're
just going to basically get a job
which which is you know that's why i was
there
i got nothing against bcit is pretty
geez louise a couple couple of
professors that you know maybe
i would recommend staying away from but
apart from that i had some uh
i had some good experiences there
just for the record i did not mean to
pop the strength card there that's my
bed
okay sit down okay goodbye
yeah if you're if you live in bc i'd
recommend
oh it depends what you're looking for
but
you know if if you're an adult and you
want to learn how to program
and you're okay with it taking like nine
years for you to get your uh
your bachelor's of science in software
engineering or
your i can't even remember your
bachelor's of technology i think
by all means
i went to a school with a highly rated
business school
my roommate was in the business school
and he's the dumbest person i've ever
met
okay well look
first off rude secondly
i mean
look i don't know what to tell you
okay i knew some people that were in
commerce
and my my alma mater and
some of them were very bright and very
nice
a lot of them were kind of stereotypical
sort of like
pseudo finance d-bags who just got into
it because like
you know it's an opportunity to make a
lot of money and like you know look good
in a suit or something
but i i wouldn't suggest that like the
whole
uh the whole industry be thrown out with
the bathwater you know what i mean
plus we were like 19 you know
just little kids nobody you don't really
know what you want at 19 for the most
part
unless you want your bottle i want my
data does nobody else see how absolutely
fricked this is
i've got a genius idea check this out
yup you will not hit me
i'm invincible if i was invincible
get what i'm saying hey i wasn't charged
up yet
oh wait i already am some other time
all right i've decided this run sucks
and i have no tether to reality because
i was bantering about poop the whole
time
but we might be able to make it still
we'll see i mean we're too far to just
give up on this one
i would like to get some hearts please
oh oh uh
wow you can really dance
i went to mcmaster the same year pokeman
studied there that was pretty pog
uh i'm happy for you bro um that's cool
yeah well i went to queen's university
uh in the same period where
rojo caliente went there so i'm not
trying to complain either
bling bling and expensive things
that's rojo caliente
ayo you see this guy teleport
i bet it's weird now like if you're in
college
like surely
a percentage of your classmates
are streamers right
just give this a sec
or like youtubers or or aspiring
influencers or something like that
that's wild man i mean it's wild to me
but
this is very normal like for you but
some of them become youtubers literally
everyone that's
crazy dude i was talking about it with
kate yesterday we were walking around
um and there was like this lady we were
walking near
and she was on facetime for like 20
minutes straight
and then kate was like wow she's been on
facetime for a long time and i was
explaining to her that in my experience
from going on these walks
literally a hundred percent of people
are on the
phone a hundred percent of the time i
didn't realize like how many
important people live in society every
day
i'm just walking around like looking at
the sights and like
trying to live in the moment literally
80
of the people that i pass are like
involved in endless conversations
i was just like i thought that the team
i think it would have been better if we
put
i'm like dude oh my god it's like you
gotta
i mean i i've only never even met them
whatsoever in my entire life but i think
i can tell them how to live their lives
you gotta unplug from now and then like
to
take some time to appreciate the the
sites like for example
okay i'm not gonna call it back again
because some people seem genuinely
bothered but
but i'm like i guess there's just people
out there that like want to talk to
other
people on the regular whereas for the
most part i just get annoyed
i still don't know how i'm teleporting
you but like i feel like if uh
i know how this is gonna sound but just
hear me out okay
if a friend of mine called me
and was like hey do you just want to
chat
once i made sure that they were okay it
would put our friendship in jeopardy
you know we we can chat over like text
on discord or like
text on the phone or something but like
if you call me and you want to have like
a
like a conversation over voice
we gotta schedule that out like in
advance
and it has to have almost a purpose to
it that elevates it to that level of
of conversation otherwise i'm like
i like don't take this the wrong way but
i'd rather listen to a podcast
i'd rather i'd rather have a podcast on
and then be in the discord
like you can type and we'll go like lol
or something like that but you're
you're gonna occupy like the entire
audio side of my
of my brain i don't think so man
okay use dark arts you get a damage
upgrade
not a like i mean i know this is like a
classic millennial slash zoomer bit
it's not even just that i'm like not a
phone guy i just think that like
you know the the younger generations
which believe it or not i include myself
in
you know we're so used to like
multitasking
that the idea of of having to focus on a
phone call with somebody
no matter how casual is actually like
like it's something you reserve for only
the most special people in your life
what the heck oh no i know jar jar is
shoot fires
i'm scared of it though so i will take
this instead
jar is great son of a
so what i was gonna say is that like
maybe it's a coincidence that i like
don't have any friends that like
ask for a call on the phone on the
regular
but i think maybe it actually makes
perfect sense
[Laughter]
all right we might get a chance to fight
mega satan
i don't know you like really like i
don't know if you should put your age in
the chat but i'm like
i feel like uh i
i don't know it just it's surprising to
me that there are people that are like
you know you have friends that are like
i can we do a voice call right now
that's totally like that's that's out of
the pocket for me
my mom sure
my mom gets like special treatment you
know
my dad and first question
is mom okay second question could this
be an email instead
i love my dad i'm just so you know one
of the one of the reasons we get along
so well i think is because he would
never be like hey can we do a quick
voice call
he would just text me with like a an
object
oh look at the big brain on this guy
he would just text me uh like a a
complete document of what's happening
you don't miss seeing your friends i do
um to an extent and i know how that
sounds
i actually didn't mean that part as a
joke like there are days where i'm like
oh you know i would like to see
other people and then there are days
where i'm like i think i'm pretty okay
right now
which i think is normal for everybody
but especially like introverts
um like you you go up and down on that
sort of stuff right
but what i don't like i don't feel like
a phone call is
is a reasonable replacement for me
you know if i'm hanging out with
somebody i've made like a commitment
in advance that like hey we're gonna
like spend some time together today
we're gonna have some like we're gonna
have some conversations we're gonna
we've agreed to give each other that
mutual level of respect
if i'm just sitting there like enjoying
my my me time and someone's like hey can
we have a call right now
i'm like whoa or if they don't even ask
if they're just like
if they just show up on the caller id
i'd be like okay buddy you know
you better be dead otherwise this could
have been a freaking discord dm
24-hour band permanent exactly
exactly this call better be caller id
heaven
i really tried to hit the button
dude we're actually gonna die i'm
realizing
that's uh i hate receiving a phone call
it's the worst
if you know it's coming
whatever all right that was that was not
a good attempt
oh well we'll put a slash marker in
there regardless um who's that that was
tainted judas
failure yet again



all right nl's been real quiet since
tainted characters dropped i think
we have an obligation to finally i mean
like look at these post-it notes like
it's embarrassing right
we beat mom's heart as kane
we beat uh something we beat the
the light side path is isaac like this
is
and we did some stuff as bethany um but
like this is kind of embarrassing right
so i'm trying to think who's got the
cool
samson has the cool uh katana item right
anyway i wanted to maybe not
no that's tinted as hazel whatever
don't hit me you jerk
um so those star wars episode one cans
from back in the day
i can't really remember i remember boss
nas
was on the seven up uh can
and i can remember qui-gon jinn
being on a can but i can't remember
what can it was
so bulba was on one too well i mean i'm
trying to think of all the pepsi
properties that are out there right so
there's seven up
pepsi itself
diet pepsi mountain dew
the pepsi cam was pod racer anakin okay
no i don't think shmee skywalker
actually
anakin's mom i don't think she made it
on to a uh
onto a can unfortunately she was not
very well known at the time because
everyone was like whoa who's this random
lady and then like
later you're like what that's darth
vader's mom dude
mind if i roll shmee
craze spoilers by the way i still have
the looney tunes jam jars that you can
use as cups
it's funny like i i guess like every
generation is gonna end up having
different uh collectible merchandise the
the collectible merchandise that
absolutely everybody in my age group had
was uh
the hercules plastic
mcdonald's plates
when the movie came out in like 1998
mcdonald's released a line of of
hercules flatware that you could buy for
like i don't know like four dollars or
something if you bought a happy meal as
well
freaking everybody had him on planet
earth
also if you live in canada and you're of
a certain age
i would guarantee that you have seen uh
the montreal expo 84 or whatever year
they had the
the world's fair um i can
picture like every family you would go
over and if they were having like a nice
dinner
they would have like the the montreal
expo
flatware out it's crazy i've seen them
like a billion times in my life
my mom might still have ours i'm telling
you man
i had the shrek cups i think it's a
little
it's a little uh past my time there's
other stuff as well i'm trying to
remember like mcdonald's used to sell
at least in canada they used to sell
uh goalie helmets
like little plastic goalie helmets that
you could get alongside of a happy meal
and there was some pretty sick toys like
i think mcdonald's happy meals
let's just do a normal run are like
still pretty good
by like packing toy standards but
they're literally like
they were probably like two or three
inches tall or something like that it
was crazy
by the way thank you for telling me how
holy card actually works now i
appreciate it thank you
i'm not even hitting you with like a
back in my day because like it doesn't
feel right
because um i know that there's a bunch
of like 35 year olds that recently ran
out to mcdonald's to buy pokemon cards
that were in the happy meal packing so
clearly
they're still doing something right oh
hello hello jay
you're was this the guy that you called
the dad from american pie
i'm not trying to put you on blast it
did make me a little bit upset
that you didn't know who eugene levy was
because i mean he's one of canada's
greatest comedic exports
not just jim's dad from american pie but
also
uh you know many christopher guest
movies
including waiting for goffman and best
in show he's
he was on sctv which is uh
basically canada's version of uh
saturday night live except i don't want
to say it's better than saturday night
live
but because saturday night live in the
70s was also pretty sick
but it's uh oh no
my devil deal like people might not know
that sctv also known as canadian
saturday night live
it was star-studded it had john candy
it had eugene levy it had catherine
o'hara also from shit's creek
it had rick moranis who you will know
from
ghostbusters and honey i shrunk the kids
and spaceballs
it starred dave thomas not wendy's dave
thomas
not that dave thomas but rather dave
thomas who also you may remember
from rat race he is uh
john cleese's assistant in the movie rat
race
it also starred joe flaherty uh
who you may remember as either the dad
of the main character
from freaks and geeks or alternatively
the guy from happy gilmore who goes you
will not make this putt you
jackass
so you know like pretty much everybody
involved with that show
went on to to have some pretty serious
comedic roles in
in in hollywood
i'm trying there's probably some other
actors from it i don't remember but
definitely like john candy eugene levy
rick moranis
i think maybe martin short was on it i
can't remember
martin shaw yeah someone said martin
short as well would you look at that
kids in the hall kids in the halls got i
mean
canada had a pretty good track record
for sketch comedy man
like um kids in the hall
i i never remember all their names but
like
one of them went on to be the teacher
from the roses music video by outcast
no there will be no speaker boxing and
then they go
the love below when you go and certainly
there will be no love belowing
you remember that
also i believe that one of the kids in
the hall might have also been
the guy who played the lizard in the in
the tobey maguire spiderman trilogy
i can't recall completely though
they might just look similar now that i
think about it
okay um i guess we're just going
straight down this run still
it needs a little gas for sure the
lizard wasn't in those movies
um the lizard wasn't in those movies but
the professor who was going to become
the lizard appears
as uh as tobey maguire's mentor in
spider-man 2
and he says uh he he encourages tobey
maguire to give up being spider-man
without
knowing that that's what toby maguire
was talking about because he
at that point was just a mild-mannered
university teacher
i would like to say as well thank you
for your support in the long-standing
debate i have with my university
roommate
about whether or not uh macho man randy
savage says me time or play time
i received uh
hundreds of comments and and a handful
of tweets
that were like he definitely says play
time
and i was like thank you i appreciate it
very thankful
i knew i was right but i i still like
it's one of the most
like the moments of my life that has the
greatest betrayal
is when my roommate thought it was me
time
and then we decided to settle it by
looking it up on wikipedia or
on imdb quote page and then imdb was
like
nah it's me time i i maintained to this
day like he must have
changed the listing because he's the
only person i've ever met who thinks
it's me time
anyway we this is probably like the most
common recurring bit so we can get off
of it i just i just wanted to say i
appreciate the support
[Laughter]
this has been it's been on my mind for i
mean that was 2006 man
this is a debate that's been ongoing for
like 15 years
it's been a long time now talk about air
fryers
dude i'm not gonna talk too much about
air fryers today
but i will say we went to the grocery
store yesterday as mentioned for the
bubbly
and uh we bought some foods
this is how much we like the air fryer
we bought some food specifically to cook
in the air fryer
kate was like let's get some chicken
fingers and i was like i've never heard
kate ask for chicken fingers before in
my whole life that's how you know the
air fryer is pogging up
and she was also like you should get
some pierogies and i was like all right
geez you don't have to don't have to
tell me twice
so i'm looking forward to it
you know i really shouldn't
but i'm gonna do it anyway i guess we
should do it like this but
this does make it a lot easier so i
actually might think about
about pivoting the run here a little bit
this makes it a lot
easier to kill the beast maybe
maybe i'll consider killing the beast as
a result of this but we need a trinket
to put in the
in the room hello i'm new here i've been
on the look for a crash bandicoot
holding a blue wampa fruit number 29 of
number 65
blue hyena crash has anybody does
anybody have intel
um
i've never never heard of it what's that
is that like one of those uh etfs i've
been hearing about
well i hope you find it like i think
like personally if i had something like
that like it's priceless i would
probably like never let it go
so i if i were you i would just give up
even looking for it it probably doesn't
even like exist
out there
edf
that's all i got that's the joke
dunk dunk i want some hp man so here's
jay you're not gonna see this okay
in in in jay's chat jay's chat's been
real quiet since the pill play happened
look at that pretty fly hp ups coming
right in what did i tell you
that one honestly that's good because it
gives me a chance to think
and that one is just the price you pay
it's that simple
clip farm get clip farmed baby
[Laughter]
every no
every once in a while you got to give
the game the chance the clip farm
come on man come on man
worst enemy in the game confirmed so his
glass cannon it's like permanently bad
now or something
jay who won wrestlemania by the way
oh it has a four-room charge oh thank
you thank you
i saw that bad baby was in it
i didn't know she was a wrestler i
thought she was like she was just a
rapper
yeah bad bad baby
catch me outside how about that tables
ladders chairs how about that
you know what i'm talking about
no all right that's fine it was an
episode of dr phil a long time ago
where there was a um a rambunctious
teenage girl and uh she threatened to
fight
dr phil she got a very maybe it was her
mom i can't remember
she had a very famous quote uh cash me
outside how about that
which means like let's fight essentially
sure i don't see how this could go wrong
um bro that was two years ago
i actually think it was probably like
six years ago
um but then she parlayed that into like
a um
into a rapping career which is now like
things are very strange because the
artist
uh who i've worked with forever for
thumbnails and some emotes and stuff
like that dracula fetus
uh actually did a completely animated
music video for her
like it's a small world man
and now she just won wrestlemania so
like i'm i'm happy for it
drac can i get you to send a message to
to bad baby and say congratulations on
your victory in the royal rumble
could you i also i got chibs sending
messages to lil nos x i don't think he's
done it yet but
i'm like hey chib message little nos x
so he'll play in the pummel party twitch
rivals
you message lil nos x and if if he says
yes then i'll message
jug meat sing and we'll try to get the
the greatest possible pummel party
twitch rivals cast you could ever
imagine
sounds legendary
no unfortunately there's no space for
bad baby
maybe next time
also i don't know she has a history of
threatening
violence i don't know if i want to have
that kind of uh
energy on my show although i have
multiple times in the past couple of
weeks
threatened to pick up chatters um over
my head and then throw them through a
plate glass window
but i think it's it's very clear when i
say it that that's meant
as satire
at least that's that's my defense
yahoo
you should be able to pick up people in
minecraft can you imagine if you could
pick up
steve and just hold him over your head
and then throw him into the lava oh my
god that would be so good
he's no no
that'd be good stuff man
your honor it was a bit
oh that's an hp upgrade hold on
papa what the
i didn't believe myself
i knew it but i didn't believe myself
clip farming baby
okay we can't not not 10 minutes into
the stream okay
not 24 minutes into the stream that we
start like that we're not starting like
that just yet
monday baby clip farm monday tony
tuesday baby a
pizza baby one key that whole floor huh
really makes you think also no trinkets
still to this day
really makes you think
i gotta say i i love the uh
the knockback that you get off of uh
glass cannon
it really feels like you're hitting them
with a like a
you don't need a trinket you're not
unlocking anything oh yeah wait you're
right
okay never mind
nothing to worry about can of corn baby
can of corn all right that's all i got
i'm pretty much like bitless
although this is a secret room
and it has a key and then you will be
exploded
and then there is a temptation to go to
the dice room so i'm gonna do it
what's everybody's favorite bit i'm a 3
8 sort of guy
we actually went to home depot like uh
two nights ago we needed a
new drywall anchor for this cat tree
that we were trying to
uh to mount and it ended up being
uh i think it was a half
it was a one over two sort of bit and
then i was like dude this thing's
freaking huge
i had no idea how big it was
what's the formula for a successfully
landed joke
i don't know i mean there's there's a
lot of things that factor into it
you'd have to ask somebody who's made
one i would say
that's not bad like there's a there's a
lot of contributing factors
right like i don't know if i want this
man
i think it's just bad get out of here um
like funny is a good part
a call back is a good part uh
word play or words that sound humorous
always do a good trick
like for example if if you can make a
joke
in hour one of the stream
and then return to that joke in hour
four it doesn't even have to be funny
just the fact that it's a reference is
enough to get you a laugh
do you respect crinkle cut fries or do
you consider them
an abomination of a potato that's a
false dilemma
i've been watching a lot of rash
rational debate youtube channels lately
that's what's known as a false dilemma
it's a fallacy in rhetoric
um that being said
i did see that there was
a a viral tweet that was like which one
of these fries has to go
and it was like straight cut fries
crinkles
waffle fries and curly fries and like a
hundred percent of people
were on the same page that crinkle cup
that's upsetting uh crinkle cut fries
have have got to go
out of all those
straight cut can get out no man like
there's just like something's not
right with some crinkles like some
crinkles turn out
great if you if you put them in the oven
for like
or the fryer i guess for the exact right
amount of time
and they're like a little crispy then
that's great
if you don't put them in for long and
long enough they're like soggy mashed
potatoes
and if you put them in for too long and
i think it's literally like a second too
long
they turn into like they're like hard
they're
they're burned and hard insubordinate
and churlish
so i think i don't know the crinkles you
need to have like a michelin star to
cook them properly
straight fries they're good curly fries
honestly like i i think that they're
like the least consistent
uh in terms of like texture and
consistency like sometimes they're like
overcooked
sometimes you get one that was like
spiral cut but all the spirals are
sticking together
but i just love the zestiness has has
there ever been an unzesty curly i don't
think so
and then waffle fries they they have so
many corners
that they're delicious no matter what
and i think like we've talked about it
before but essentially the more
corners a cooked food has the more
delicious it is because it gets more uh
it has more crispiness uh
moments
there's more locuses loci of crisp
an onion ring has infinite corners i got
nothing against onion rings
i see what you're getting that's a
geometry joke or reference i suppose um
i would here's my my only problem
with with onion rings
is that so often you end up biting in
and then as you bite you end up pulling
out like the whole onion
and then you're just left with like a
hollow circle of batter
which is not that bad like there's worse
things in this life
just get him i'm just mostly saying like
i wish there was a way around it like if
only like they filled the onion with
like
mashed onion instead of just like a
contiguous ring so that when you bid in
it kind of like maintained the the the
turgor pressure throughout that would be
the dream come true
yeah you gotta you gotta do like a
shining motion with your teeth
you got to do a a sawing motion and then
it's exacerbated because people are
really taking liberties with like the
size of the onion rings that they're
making
i get that it's harder to make small
onion rings because you know
onions are a pretty large uh
vegetable to begin with but
yes why not
i regret everything for the record and
what do you got for me lover's car okay
hold on
two three
four one two
one two
saved it heavily saved
one of the smartest uh man on the on the
planet right there
i'm still so slow though 1.1 speed
could you make poutine with onion rings
it's an interesting question i think the
answer is no
because there's like an enormous hole
i just don't see how it would function
i really like i hate to admit it because
onion rings are kind of like the default
i think that the bloomin onion is a like
a smarter way to
deep fry onions you by having strips
instead of having
uh rings you you know negate the problem
of having the whole onion come out in
your mouth
i've never had one but i believe it's i
believe it they are obviously horrible
for you
because the the batter to onion ratio is
is just staggering but still
yeah i mean if i uh if i went to an
outback i think i'd get one
oh they're they're terrible for you
absolutely no question
the whole axe like where the fries
aren't there you go
you know what i'm thinking now though
now this has become mouth stream
apparently
but what i'm thinking now is like what
if you had an onion ring
but you turned it into like an onion
coaster
so yeah i know you're like what the heck
is this guy talking about
so what you do is you have an onion ring
but then also
a little batter floor
so you have like a continuous sort of
like container you know what i mean
and then you fill that with the gravy
and the cheese curds
so you could eat it almost as like a
little onion poutine
croquette if you will like a little
onion disk
yeah like a little miniature onion
poutine ring
you could really i think you could only
get away with it as like a food truck or
like a carnival sort of food but
if anybody's if anybody out there owns
disney world please let me know
i would love to sell my idea to you for
the cost of a one year subscription to
disney plus
home of such originals as the falcon and
the winter soldier
juan division and also forkey asks a
question
how would you make the the batter fill
the center um i don't know it's more of
a question for like the
the egg egg heads down in the center uh
the center console you know what i mean
that's not for the idea guys the idea
guys just do their best
they come up with things and then it's
the industrial light and magic that puts
it into action
let me tell you this is hp up right here
it almost worked even though it it
didn't work
it almost worked
one moment please one moment
walt disney but instead it's walter
white
it's a good bid jesse
we need to draw
jesse we need to outline we need to
sketch
you know mickey jesse mickey
i found pills smell my
fun gear
pete rat g like guma can die
say my name okay we've
gone off the rails this is what happens
when you have a long run here
okay okay okay okay okay
now we're talking
stapler is extremely good
it's so loud man
yeah it's just an example like hey we're
keeping it positive here
um it's an example of chat taking it too
far yeah i appreciate that
hey look here's the thing we all know
walt disney has a reputation
of uh you know not being the nicest guy
on planet earth
to put it politely
[Laughter]
at the same time you know whenever
anybody says the word disney
you don't need to slip into character
you know what i mean it's it
it's very ripe for being misinterpreted
hey what did i tell you baby clip
farming yet again
you've made me the happiest man in
springfield
oh not me friends uh but thank you he i
think he's talking about himself
monday clip farm baby how's this run
going
um at the present moment i actually
think is pretty good
we're we're aiming to defeat the beast
i believe that there is uh there's a
good chance
oh come on man um
but we got a ways to go still we got a
ways to go
it's gonna be a little close for sure um
by the way someone said nl what's your
favorite clip of yourself
i think about this from time to time
there's a few i really like
um i mean the the spray clip in the
gulag is hilarious i'm not embarrassed
by it it's just
it's just funny and then the reaction
like that naturally came out of my face
is just it's perfect
it's a great clip i can't be mad um
i also and i i
hate that i love this so much but the
clip
where we were playing apex and apollo
says he found an
anal receiver and i said what did you
find a mirror
but i couldn't even get the words out
without laughing
like i think back to that clip all the
time and i'm like this is
probably the funniest thing i've ever
said
it's it's even now it's got me
just got me going a little bit it's so
good
oh wow oh no
what the heck
silverfish clip is great yeah yeah yeah
you know what check this out baby
i'm not afraid anymore hey waz
just pop that fool card
donald duck donald duck's pretty good
why are you being weird dude it's donald
duck
there's a lot of good ones for sure i i
do like there's a lot of great dan clips
says oh
i use the full card
i thought i was being so smart okay
well maybe a heavy rip on that one
that's my bad
well if we beat the next three floors in
20 seconds we could always fight uh
fight mom or fight uh the hush oh you
know what you're right
what if if we beat mom and then
die in the room we should respawn
outside of the room
and then be able to continue on that
path now we'll lose
three heart containers to do it but like
you know
what what do you want me to do we're
kind of i screwed myself a little bit
there could be some telepills but again
it's like i mean we'll hold it and then
we'll use it later i guess and see
i mean that's true you know what we just
really need to do anything on this run
so why don't we just make this like a
light side run yeah we don't need to
we don't need to get any any freakier
than that
oh you know what you're right there is a
judgment out there
we could also bomb every skull for cards
but really i think that
realistically maybe it's actually like a
happy
accident believe it or not because i i
don't think we could beat the beast on
this run
it's quite nice
i think we might be better off just
trying to like unlock like literally
anything
we'll see i already
already handled that my bad sorry i was
glancing
yeah this is uh this is
tainted samson he's a cool dude who
doesn't afraid of anything
final skull attempts
we have golden bombs it's not like it's
a huge whiff
second secret room potentially what is
this early streaming
does nl normally stream early eu times
um since since january yes
this is a normal stream time that's a
good get right there man that's a lucky
get
i mean maybe it's not early by eu
standards but earlier than it used to be
i mean look it's been four months but
it's only been four months you know we
got people that
you know i i've been looking at the
twitter mentions and replies and stuff
like that and there's people i'm seeing
some avatars that i haven't seen in like
a few years
people are coming back a little bit and
on mass thanks to
thanks to isaac
what was it before before we had
our baby i used to stream
like late afternoon pacific time
and then like europeans in the chat
would just be like please start the show
it's 5 00 a.m
and i would be like no like
i i stream 11 to 4 now i used to stream
three to six that hurts
uh or two to five most days so like it
was uh
it was a much later start
and honestly like this is why i ended up
like eating lunch at like 6 p.m
many days and all right we've already
been there that's fine
yeah it went it went very late
wow i was just i literally just stood
there and ate it on the bright side we
did get a range upgrade
monday baby yeah i think the new
schedule is working out quite nicely
honestly
you know it's a side effect of like
having a very limited amount of time for
sure
um but i think it leaves me with like
you know
the sun is still up when i finish
streaming which is really nice
uh like for mood and
and also like running errands and stuff
like that
like it's much nicer to cook dinner when
the sun is still out instead of like
you know at 11 a.m
uh reykjavik visibility i i e pitch
black
no offense iceland shot speed up range
down
okay no disrespect
that's fine you can tell it's not fine
because i'm scratching my head angrily
but
i mean what no i gotta remember we're
just going the normal path
the normal path you could do it with one
hp come on
what like it's hard
need to work on your tells that's why
i'm not a good poker player man
in this economy
cobalt is shaving his head tomorrow are
you afraid
um i'm afraid of how cool he'll look
this is it's a bit of a strange question
i'm handling it in good faith though i
don't understand
i don't know i think there's a
contingent of people who think that like
like i saw one guy
in chat the other day this is not
negative but he was like i think being
bald has helped your streaming career
and i'm like what are you talking about
[Laughter]
i just i remember you could probably go
back into the vod and and find a moment
where i went like
and didn't say anything and i was like
what the heck is he talking about being
bald has helped your streaming career
it's part of the brand yeah but like
having hair is also part of people's
brand
when they have hair like look at ninja
i think it's it's just kind of a weird
thing to bring up
like every streamer like part of their
brand ends up being like
you know what they look like you know
they'll be like oh it's beard stream
beard stream it's dreadlock stream
dreadlocks get get your dreadlock smiles
out you know everybody's tim the tatman
yeah everybody's got like a
a characteristic that becomes part of
the brand i don't think the baldness has
anything to do with it
plus i wasn't even bothered yesterday
that was like the the most hair i've had
on my head in a long time i hadn't
shaved for nine days
yeah i got a haircut you didn't even
notice
saved saved
smack him smack him
hold on this this actually requires
focus because i'd also like to get this
devil deal
no it's all right i got 1.25 speed we
got nothing to worry about look at that
look at that which hair did you cut oh
oof oof um um oof
oof
i know when i start looking like elliot
spitzer that's when it's time to
do a little shave and also like dude i
don't know if other people
like when they shave they have the same
thing but like
i was trying to like so i trimmed my
beard with like the beard trimmers
um and then i shaved my head on like no
guard so i have a little guard on the
face
there was like one hair it was literally
like i feel like it was like eight
inches long
and it was it's kind of curly so it was
like curled under
um my jawline a little bit so it's like
you couldn't
really see it um but i could see it
and then i i focused
on trying to trim it for like a minute i
ran the razor over it like
30 times and it just would not trim it
was like steel wool
it was like a vibranium or something man
but anyway i got it out
i just i plucked it but
hold on hold on
keep it moving here have there been more
attempts on the hidden challenge
no not after the uh the accursed stream
where i played it for like a few hours
but we will get there like
uh we'll go back to it don't get me
wrong i just keep needing momentum
over and over every stream i'm like we
need some momentum and then i'm like oh
let's do alt path the hardest character
in the game and then i
get nothing done and i'm like a freaking
suck and then i come back the next day
and i'm like let's do
let's get some momentum and i'm like oh
this runs pretty good maybe we'll just
do all path
freaking dead you know it's like that
kind of cycle
we'll get there one day though
yeah like so people are saying you could
like use scissors don't get me wrong
like i'm sure that's the right way to do
it
but anytime like i've read some like you
know how to how to maintain a beard
articles online and it's been like the
best way to maintain your beard is to
use
uh scissors to like trim the hairs
individually and i'm like okay
what's the second best way because i am
not using a comb and a pair of scissors
to try to get
like every hair on my face to be the
exact perfect length
that's insane that's like some patrick
bateman stuff
like are you crazy
and then like the other way they're like
you just use the trimmer and i'm like
all right
i think i'm a trimmer guy i think i will
remain
trim focused then
okay just just don't get hit here cuz
like
we got it we got some good stuff going
oh that was a little spicy
don't forget about lil brim it's a
mighty helpful item in in
many circumstances okay now i'd say
we're kind of safe
safer whoa
what the heck you know what i
i haven't done this path too much i need
to learn the tell
for for that i know you can't stay in
the corners anymore but i didn't learn
what the tell was
merciful merciful you actu you just
dodge the light now
what the heck
it's like using scissors to trim to trim
your beard
i think i'll just i'll just stick to the
corners
i did say dream
it's very good like insanely good with
uh with good luck
that's also pretty sick
that's also pretty sick now the coins
not so much but everything else was
really good
it's a ghost pepper
all right you want you want some
momentum how did we not get hit
for that oh my god
five luck is gonna give us a whip
hold on a minute hold on a minute we got
nine lives for now i don't want to
potentially reroll us into devastation
okay i know it's zany but the runs
already got
a certain zane coefficient here let's
just
chill out for a bit it's not cowardly to
use glass cannon like glass cannon is
still really spicy
a rage makes you invincible okay
boy i wish i knew that at the start of
the run
that doesn't appear to be invincible
toasty
we do a little trolling have i been
trolled
no no no i got my information from chad
a likely story
you can't die during rage okay you're
gonna have to bait better than that
i've recently been hit by bait and as a
result i'm temporarily inoculated
against it
that one's true did i
stutter
that one is actually actually true
have you lost your damn mind
okay sorry
stanley your heart sucks and you crush
your wife during sex
boom roasted
dude no joke
if we get a void portal here i feel
comfortable
how's that for cowardice i feel
comfortable letting it ride
oh no i guess i can't
all right unlocks online wait no cause
you need four things to get an unlock
baby but
but on unlocks baby look at that okay
done done slash marker end of tainted
samson one okay we bubble



and all right i've i've had a lot of
requests to unlock
tainted lilith cobalt thank you for
being here please don't make fun of
where
uh my post-it notes are i'm doing my
best
and bro deity thank you for the gifted
subscriptions as well
thank you i'm just uh
well that's definitely part of it as
well so this is carrying over from the
previous
video where we were discussing um phone
call etiquette
and how surprised i am to see so many
people talking
when i'm outside uh but then you know i
i think this is definitely valid that i
also talk
all day so when i'm off
hours i really like i just want to be
quiet for a bit i turn into like a
little mouse
but i also just hate the phone in
general
like as a kid i thought it was pretty
cool but i think it's because i didn't
have any other options
now that there's other options i'm like
why are you calling me when you when you
you had the opportunity to hit me on any
other like low impact form of
of entertainer of communication you're
calling me
and just to give you an idea and this is
like it's approaching middle-aged bit i
guess but like
um you know
my mom texted me like last monday and
she's like hey just so you know we're
taking your grandma
or you're done ambulance is taking your
grandma to the hospital because she's
got like super high blood pressure
and i was like oh no let me know what's
up
and then she replied like oh they
already took her home she just needed
like a prescription or something
so that's the kind of stuff like my mom
texts me whenever she sends me a text
that's like hey can we do a voice call
i'm like what the heck's going on
and then sometimes it's like you know
pseudo serious stuff
but sometimes she's like hey do you want
me to bring
like you know your high school yearbooks
the next time i visit and i'm like
come on we could have done that part
over text
[Laughter]
i don't pay by the letter and even if i
did that's only two
bombs please two two of diamonds now
we're talking
yeah yeah y e y p yes please
i don't remember what this is so
i'm gonna buy it reds red stew
red stew it's an hp up that's pretty
good
wait this not an hp up
i i see the damage don't get me wrong
i guess we'll just leave man the keeper
with coins in their eyes have a good
chance to drop
nickels if they're blown up so i think
what you're saying is
look for the keeper with the
coins in his eyes and he's
gone dunk dunk dunk
keeper with the coins in his
rotten tomato
picture yourself in the stream
with the eggman he reads your message
sarcastic replies hurting your
feelings you head to the reddit
make a thread with eighty to reply
i'm not mad i just think that
it's funny
he's lost control of his chat
look for the keeper with coins in his
eyes and he's okay all right here we
let's get out of here that was too long
but we have an excuse to go fast now
because we got a red stew
this is even more so than just getting
like
a damage upgrade temporarily dude we got
an excuse that's like the most valuable
tool in the toolbox
why did i take book of sin now that i
think about it i was
a little lost in the in the in the lucy
in the sky with diamond stuff
it was a question mark oh okay thank you
for the reminder thank you
thank you
saved saved thank you
was that the deadly premonition credits
song i wish man
that's my suddenness
nobody can't yell me a rainbow
appears after the rain
i tried to varnish my scarf
i did it she's that's another clip that
is one of my
one of my favorites
dude i'm surprised that like so many um
and i gotta keep like some tether to
reality on this run don't get me wrong
i uh i'm surprised that
so many people that liked deadly
premonition one
or loved it even absolutely hate deadly
premonition too
it's worse and that's like apparent to
see
but i actually think like it's kind of
it's good in a similar way that deadly
premonition one was good
if you were into the the weirdness like
i
absolutely think it's worth playing i
hate to be like this ultimate gatekeeper
but like especially because i was late
to the party on deadly premonition
uh one but i'm like
inclined to believe that if you like
deadly premonition one
and cannot stand deadly premonition too
i feel like you didn't actually like
deadly premonition one man
i don't stand by that but i did say it
all right you can only get one of the
the rewards now i recall
what i would what i would stand by
good pick good pick good pick good pick
what i would stand by
is i feel like deadly premonition 2 is a
little underrated
it is also an absolute technical mess
that's kind of inexcusable um
but maybe the pc version will
fix that but probably not but
either way um
i still think it's worth playing if you
like the original
more than the first game oh yeah like it
technically speaking is
substantially worse than the first game
is deadly premonition on switch kappa
face cobalt i don't know how to play
that
um that meme there because it's it's
only on switch
that might be what you're insinuating i
don't know it's it's
mercurial
oh thank you by the way the reminder to
drop a trinket on the boss room
f we don't have a trinket yet but
least we stopped losing red stew
or damage as a result of red stew
red stew i mean deadly premonition one
is
is a classic i i would trust me deadly
premonition two is worse
i wouldn't try to make that uh
you know ridiculous opinion true but
uh mushroom trinket please still pretty
good
i'm excited for this run cobalt this
thank you this is so nice of you thank
you
i appreciate it
we out here pick up the bean okay give
me a sec i forgot there was a bean
transformation
i just want somebody to check to check
on sweary and make sure sweary's okay
[Laughter]
just hope he's okay feel like absolute
crap just want him back
you're snarfing saved me your music
saved me
i try to hide my sadness
bubbly of the day baby you know what
it's a good time to hydrate
at least a little bit
lips are still chapman and it's from the
overcooked stream which is
is comical but don't don't get me
started okay on the minion bubbly
i've already i covered it you know what
let's do it man because it doesn't do
anything with incubus never mind okay
they fixed that
um maybe it's always been like that but
lesson learned um
either way
i i bought even if kate even like
brought it up to me she was like she
asked me if i ever tried blackberry
bubbly
and i said not only have i tried it but
i think it might be my favorite flavor
and she said oh then why are you buying
lime bubbly
and i said because it has the minions on
the case so i hope it has the minions on
the can
and then when i opened it up it did not
have minions on the can
i was pretty disappointed to be honest
with you
i don't really care about the minions
but i thought it would have made for
like a pretty good
bit on stream if i had uh
if i had had a can that had minions on
it we've got a little bit of a minion
history here
but i was also like i don't know like
you can just do that like pepsi sells
sparkling water the consumer pays full
price
but then also now there's an ad for
despicable me
the rise of gru or minions the rise of
gru that's on the
that's on the box like why is there's an
ad on the box but it doesn't come with
any cool like minions cans
that seems like i feel kind of ripped
off
it's like i bought a commercial and i
didn't even get the cool minions cans to
go with it
i might give them a piece of my mind a
little bit later i'm i haven't decided
yet
that's marketing baby i mean i'm just a
little upset because like
i would suggest that
because like here's the thing is that
the minion was also like
we need a trinket pog the minion was
wearing a green outfit and they were
lime bubbly so i thought for sure it
would
have a minion on the can and then it
didn't can we at least see the minion
box
it's already been taken to recycling
town man
as soon as i here here's a little tip
for productivity you know i love the
self-help
when you buy a 12-pack of beverage
remove
all cans from the box break down the box
and put it in your recycling right away
rather than shoving the box into your
fridge
and then just ripping over a corner of
it as fast as you can
and then leaving the empty box in your
fridge for like six months afterwards
i will say though the other thing is so
when i was looking at the minion box
and it was like
minions the rise of gru only in theaters
there's no
date on it which i will say you know in
the era of covid kind of makes some
sense
maybe to be a little bit more open-ended
but i was also like didn't that movie
come out like
excuse me didn't that movie come out
like a year and a half ago or two years
ago
i thought they'd already made the rise
of gru and then i was like am i buying
old sparkling water and then i thought
to myself does it matter it's not like
it's gonna go bad
so i was just really confused
it just it got delayed for a year oh
okay
i was just mighty confused hey hey hey i
was glancing
maybe it would go flat i don't know
i didn't think it could go flat unless
the can was opened
unless the the the wall of the can was
breached but i don't know
they had to add teeth to the minions
how many though 60
that'd be scary right dan you might be
an expert
you've probably seen some of the the
minion movies right or or did they
did the first ones happen when you were
uh of an age where you wouldn't be
interested and then the later ones
happened when your kids were too young
i'm waiting
banter um i've i've hit you with the the
banter button
uh bruh minions are twinkies with eyes
never saw
have you thought about when you're gonna
introduce your kids to the karate killed
uh karate kill the karate kid franchise
now we're talking look at this man
anti-grav brimstone
drink it in the bathroom malibu
nights tangerine dreams
because it's time for some breakfast
it's time for some cheese
okay this is definitely highly winnable
i've kind of what shot me did i shoot me
i've kind of been memeing it up we can
do better though
bro did i do that
bro okay i'm starting to feel like
taking anti-grav
might not have been to play
it's a little bit of prep time we can do
it a little bit of prep time we can do
it
d.a.e question did you have all the
isaac trophies pre-repentance yeah i've
gotten
um like the one trillion three billion
percent whatever it is
prior to repentance i didn't have it on
this save file i think i think i was
missing like a couple of challenges that
i haven't
i don't know bro
bro
it's pretty neat how i've devised the
run here that requires you to stand in
directly in the line of fire to hit
these enemies
is this horrible like this this is
actually
brimstone has made the run substantially
worse which is not brimstone's fault is
anti-grav's fault but like oh my god
okay you know what yeah i think you're
right i think it's
i think it's time to start just dodging
i mean it's a little late let's be real
i got one hit left but
and then just leaving little like traps
around
hoping that maybe over time
we get to take out enough enemies to
maybe
have the ability to dodge
stop moving i'm not very strong against
uh mobile enemies
saved
okay
yeah it's one of those things where i'm
like we actually like dodged super well
that room
but the flip side is like i need to just
repeat that
until we get enough hp to just leave i
think like homing tears would do it
homing can of corn baby homing tears
would take me to a good spot
did you leave a trinket look i i
wouldn't concern myself with that
high level gameplay just yet
please stop moving out of the way of my
brimstone beam the answer is yes by the
way the non-snarky answer is yes the
snarky answer is i wouldn't worry about
it too much just yet
stop moving
i deserve that one i'm willing to admit
i deserve that one
got a little too zany
anyway like mostly i blame that one on
the minions cans
i'm still i'm a little bit disappointed
by the
the fact that and the other thing is
that pepsi has also not made a statement
about it
uh not pepsi not making a statement
about the minions cans i
uh just admit you hate gru and move on
have you tweeted about it no i don't
want to jeopardize our soon-to-be
working relationship
you can't drop that trinket and now
what's your go-to hot sauce
um
my favorite available most places hot
sauce is cholula
that being said i only keep one
hot sauce at home because otherwise i
wouldn't be able to fit the
six half empty bottles of the same brand
of mustard that we have
without them like breaking the fridge
shelf so i
uh right now i have to get through this
bottle
of frank's red sauce that we inherited
from my mom last time she was here
once i get and i like it don't get me
wrong once we get through that frank's
red hot sauce then i will be adding
cholula back into the equation
that's all i got you don't have to
refrigerate cholula
really that i did not know
yeah i think frank's it gets a bad rap
to some extent
obviously it's popular but also i think
you know because it's not that spicy and
it's very like
you know is a strong flavor of vinegar
people give it a little bit of
disrespect it's like the number one
thing that people
say about a hot sauce is there like it
just tastes like hot vinegar and i'm
like yeah dummy i love it
who doesn't like vinegar dude that's
what i'm that's what i'm all about
i like the tang you know i i think this
is true in like the uk
as well did you know in canada we put
vinegar on our
french fries
maybe this is like an eastern seaboard
thing as well in the u.s but
for real and not just like white vinegar
but malt vinegar sometimes too
like vinegar on fries is undefeated
absolutely i'm glad to see so many
people agree with me on this by the way
okay we don't need to make it an
anti-american bit about how they don't
have
electric kettles over there
which is not even true in america they
do have electric kettles
did i get it backwards was that was it
that they don't have non-electric
kettles
i'm here to tell you i think that an
electric kettle is better i don't know
like
that's the thing with canada is is much
like iceland
we're kind of like midway between uh
well iceland is like half north american
half european at least that's kind of
like the vibe i got
and then canada is like half american
half british so we're always like
straddling the line
there's some things that they do in
america where i'll turn to like you know
england and be like
check check out what the yanks are up to
today and then sometimes i'll look at
what they call like uh
a truck in england and i'll look down at
america and be like you see what these
guys
are doing up there what's going on man
crazy trinket yeah yeah can of corn
can of corn
yeah in canada we we play both sides so
we always come out on top
i can't imagine calling iceland north
american you got to look at the tectonic
plates
i didn't invent it pangea invented it
name a woman it's like my favorite
non-sequitur now
anytime you get trapped in a
conversation name a woman
um name a woman name o for one dollar
can you name a woman
a woman freak you yoga bag name a woman
i'm sorry
thoughts on the atom goddet trade uh
honestly
like um so this is like the trade
deadline in the nhl is happening
the canucks literally have not played a
game for like
i don't know like three and a half weeks
because of colvin
uh but we traded adam gaudette
who was like our fourth line center uh
all i'm gonna say
is uh you know adam we had a chance to
work together i tweeted you many times
when you were in the war zone and
streaming i said hey adam big fan
it'd be fun to do some content together
ghosted
and then i look at your mentions and and
your tweets and you're tweeting nick
merc's going hey nick i'm a big fan of
your content it'd be nice if we could
game together sometime
uh good luck in chicago
and that's all there is to it
seems like it might be a better
environment for you
savage it seems like a pretty bad trade
though over vancouver but
you know it'll be nice for me like the
locker room will be better for me now
because i won't have to be like oh my
god does he remember when i tweeted him
savage savage man
no we don't talk about honky i'll start
talking about hockey again when the
canucks actually get to play
as mentioned i am a basketball fan now
love the nets
lifelong nets fan i i love all of the
nets historical players
such as kevin durant and uh
james harden and also jason kidd also
they're coached by steve nash
love the nets nets baby
love the nets lebron more like le fraud
try winning a real ring sometime
this is this is what i gather from
twitter
i do this is not fair but i do love like
sometimes i end up finding myself in
nba twitter just due to that well that
does it i'm done being a lakers fan i'm
gonna head over to sacramento where
they had know what being a team means
but um
sometimes you like see a picture that's
like this is the competition lebron had
to play against and it's
basically like 10 professional
bodybuilders and then it's like
this is the competition michael jordan
had to play against and it's like a guy
who looks like me
with hairy shoulders and like a little
bit of a pot belly and i'm like you know
you're not wrong like professional
athletes these days
really they they're looking like like
spartan warriors man
michael jordan played against some
serious competition from what i
understand like
you know patrick ewing but patrick ewing
owes michael jordan a great debt of
gratitude as well because
he saved his basketball powers from the
monstarz after the monstars stole it
from patrick ewing so
honestly they're just about even
yeah tell me i'm wrong
anyway that's all i got i don't know
anything about basketball except squeak
squeak
squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak
squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak
squeak squeak squeeze that's the sound
of the shoes on the hardwood
on the hard cord playing some round ball
shmeesh
this runs not all that right now huh
yeah i don't know sports who needs a man
now that the canucks aren't playing i'm
inclined to temporarily become one of
those people who's like
um
the ae sports ball i only play fire
emblem three houses
no i can't stand up to that because or i
can't back that up
because we're going to um
play some mlb the show this week oh dan
you getting mlb the show brother
oh be honest are you are you buying it
day one or are you waiting to see if
maybe they they take a little sip of the
bounty potion again
plus 1.3 percent chance of a devil deal
poggy
poggy
bounty day one bye i hear you
i'm just like i'm so parched man for
like new stuff to play
on the consoles that's why i was telling
you to play some pac-man
i was like it's the biggest aaa release
of the month well okay outriders is also
pretty sick don't get me wrong
you know what's weird about baseball i
feel like
baseball superstars have except for
pitchers
have like the highest turnover of any
sport
like i i haven't really followed
basketball for a couple of decades
but like i know you know you learn some
names when they're drafted
they're going to be around for a while
like greg oden he's got to be crushing
it these days
but um in baseball it's like
i feel like the players take so long to
develop that like by the time
i hear of them they're already over the
hill
like the the last live baseball game i
went to
there was an up-and-coming superstar on
the boston red sox
i don't remember his full name but it
was long
and he was i think he played catcher and
he hit a home run
in the game um could you name some
boston red sox i believe his name might
have started with a y
as crazy as that sounds
it was not pistachio zoolander it was
not
salta laka makia
it was not your jimbo kevin you kill us
yeah
yeah yeah yeah okay so kevin you kill
his gossip that
gets up there i never heard of this guy
in my life you look at his stats on the
jumbotron he's got like a 433 average or
something like that
you kayla sorry sorry anyway he hits a
home run and everyone booze and they're
like i hate this guy
like two years later he's not even like
in the league anymore like nobody cares
about him everyone's talking about
the acuna junior or something like
everybody keeps uh they turn over so
fast
they weren't booing they were saying you
no this game was in toronto they were
definitely booing
throwing bottles onto the field flipping
bats and
punching the second baseman in the head
i know all the baseball memes i i see
sportscenter from time to time
i just feel like they they like they
haven't
maybe i'm wrong but i thought they had a
lot of turnover in baseball because like
if somebody gets drafted first overall
in the mlb
aren't they also like oh dude this is
cool i didn't realize we got the
rotationals thanks to this don't they
have this
like season in the miners until they're
like 24 years old
it does take a while right
like in the nhl if you're drafted in the
first round
usually you're going to play your first
game in the nhl and if you're at the
very tippy top you know you're playing
the next year otherwise it's usually
like two or three years and they start
to give you a chance
absolutely
which is also crazy because it seems
like baseball should be
okay like it's not like they change the
game that much when you go up a level
right like
well oh now i'm a second baseman oh it's
so much harder to catch the ball now
you know come on
but i guess it isn't like the thing with
baseball is that it's like a permanent
kind of like arms race it's like the
joker versus batman
like that the hitters right now are the
best hitters by far that have ever
existed
but the pitchers are also the best
pitchers that have ever existed so the
averages are roughly the same
historically or something
i'm not sure about um this trinket it
seems
cool but also bad
i don't know
i was i was going to say if my key piece
rotates
maybe maybe dude i think we should keep
rolling it because it's zany although i
would like some momentum today
hey the dgo thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
what drink it we can't see it is some
heart on a
heart on a necklace friendship necklace
heart on a necklace
can of corn can of corn and i'll be all
right
friendship bracelet thank you
i'm all i'm waiting for cobalt to weigh
in like i know you just did but
it's whenever cobalt weighs in i'm like
now
i can trust him otherwise do you and
again i'm not
look we're keeping the mood positive but
like sometimes i gotta remember like in
every other game
when i i'm dropping it in every other
game when i get back seated i'm like
chat's probably right
sometimes in this i get backseated and i
default to assuming people are right
because i'm used to being wrong about
games
and then i remember i've played more of
this game than like literally anybody in
chat unless you're here
so like that's the i i've gotta remember
you gotta
you gotta verify the credentials of the
poster first otherwise i
i default to my own wisdom
it's turning out instantly better here
look at this
there's bubbly sodastream flavoring so
i'm going to tell you
it's a real story okay i i was with the
baby the other day
i went to canadian tire
and i got this i put the baby in the
stroller took her out
took her into the front of the store and
i was thinking like maybe i'm gonna buy
a soda stream today maybe today's the
day
i went in through the front door there
was a little ramp because when you're
with the stroller
it depends on the size of the staircase
but if there's like a big staircase
you're gonna need a ramp right
so i went up the ramp at the top of the
ramp was a large staircase and i said oh
i guess i went the wrong way
i went down the ramp and there was
another ramp going down that i assumed
would go to an elevator
i went all the way down that ramp and it
just came to a door that said
maintenance
so i just went back to the front
entrance and left i was like i
legitimately i can't figure out how to
get inside of the store
so i i just i just bounced
was it meant to be
i was a little embarrassed yes
how much canadian tire money do you have
i have none
um because when i uh
when i get canadian tire money i always
pop it in the little donation box at the
edge of the cash register which is
really funny because it's like the
business is like donating
to itself and i'm always i always think
of that picture from
hot fuzz of timothy dalton standing in
front of the like employee of the month
photo and making the exact same face
like canadian tire is like thank us for
our support and i like uh
you're welcome
the tower huh can of corn
name an orbital that could be good man
that could be good
timothy dalton yo bro go look it up okay
i'm not trying to blow your mind it just
happens all the time
um but that is uh that's timothy dalton
dude that's james bond
any orbital name in orbital
frick you tower card name an orbital
whole foods here asks if you want a bag
refund or a bag donation if you uh bring
your own bags to the store
yeah i hear you i don't mean to brag but
you know i'm all about that
uh bag donation so
like if you just wanna give me the nobel
prize
right now i'll be happy to take it
that bad that bag donation is your bag
baby
that would be a fun little bit maybe for
like eric andre to do or something like
that
like imagine if you went to whole foods
and they were like bag donation or bag
refund
and then you just went
hmm
that that could be good man that could
be good
like how long do you think it would
they'd let you go before they were like
could you please leave i bet you could
string him along for upwards of five
minutes
it's kind of rude but if as long as
you're filming that rudeness and then
using it for somebody else's
entertainment later
it passes the test of utilitarian
usefulness
i think they'd let you go for five
minutes man
have you seen some of the stuff they
sell in whole foods they definitely have
the customer is always right as an
attitude right
uh can i get quinoa cheese
they if they didn't have quinoa cheese
they would get some for you i promise it
would
charge you through the freaking nose but
they would get it for you
excuse me no insults to whole foods
please they're part of the amazon
brand constellation
much like twitch and much like audible
i am happy to report as well and this
has come up a little bit
i have uh entered the menu meal
preferences section
of the lunch service that we get
and i have removed all fake meat dishes
no more will i be like hey what's for
lunch today
oh spicy chick dash yum bowl
um you won't believe it's not chicken
crab cakes crab is spelled with like a q
you know i i kept a lot of the
vegetarian dishes on there that i like
like the masala chickpea wrap on grilled
naan
that's fantastic but anything that's
like
you know you won't believe it's not meat
i'm like it's meat that i'm looking for
that is texture vegetable protein which
is fine but like why are you flexing you
know
like you're like a meat rebound didn't
fool me
i would like to go to the shop but like
on the other hand who cares
like that you know what that would be
another good um
another good i'll put it on the
spreadsheet along with the sparkling
water taste test and the pepsi challenge
another good uh variety streaming bit
would be can i tell the difference
blindfolded between meat and meat
alternatives
and you might think that i would be on
the lookout for like
proving that i have superior palette but
honestly like if i actually
came across some stuff that was
undetectable i would be happy to remove
the
that aspect of meat for my life for sure
i mean
again i've gone through this multiple
times i've been a vegetarian before
i love vegetarian food i just don't like
most of the time when it's like
you know hey here's a meat food surprise
it's
actually seitan you know
that's my yeah i don't like crab with a
q
if you if you chop up a bunch of
cuttlefish and then you use the
cuttlefish with a little bit of red food
coloring and make it look like crab
i could maybe get down with it but when
the crab
smells like a pinto bean i'm like come
on you're not fooling anybody
a trinket
name a trinket
i would like a key please
yeah it's like the end i i took some
heat for this before but i i gotta
remember like
i'm i'm a pretty enlightened individual
i've i'm very worldly
i've i've been everywhere man and etc
etc
thank you by the way for tinted skull
like when i when they came out in canada
with the beyond burger i
like the beyond burger we had it many
times i enjoyed it
but then they also came out with like um
the light life burger which is like 50
beef 50 vegetable
burger and i i went off for a little bit
where i was like
i just don't understand like what market
share this appeals to
and there were a surprising amount of
people that were like
actually like my uncle is like afraid of
vegetables but i got him to sign off on
trying a 50 50 burger and now he's like
a little bit more
interested in trying vegetarian cuisine
and i'm like oh you know
i guess it goes to show you like
i'm a snob it's basically
i'm just like judgmental i guess is what
it comes down to
but i was also like i'll admit there was
a part of me that i was also like what
if you just told your uncle to like stop
being a little baby and just like
take a bite of one thing that maybe he
won't
enjoy but maybe he will like
i don't know
this is good okay
yeah it's like i mean you're like 50
years old and you're like i don't want
to try this thing that was specifically
designed to taste as much like a burger
as possible but
anyway hold on i need a coin name a coin
the arcade that's what you do
yeah if you don't enjoy it you don't
enjoy it by the way people are saying
like what if you use faded polaroid on
the door
i'm just gonna be honest with you i
might be stupid i don't know what you're
talking about
i i know that there's a door what does
it mean to use a trinket
what a novel concept thursday what a
concept right
you know what i'm talking about russian
doll on netflix natasha leon
can of corn just walk into the door name
a door
what are you talking about name a door
okay this is good you use
regular polaroid on the door i don't
know what you're saying to me
what do you mean you use polaroid
i'm not being deliberately obtuse i
don't understand how
what what verb could you replace use
with in this situation
and also could you name a woman for one
dollar
approach approach oh i don't even have
the trinket hold on hold on hold on hold
on
how does this it works just like the
how the heck does that work oh because
it's the polaroid that unlocks that in
the first place
dude can i tell you something that
you're gonna find hilarious i did not
put two and two together
i actually thought the trigger to open
the door
was just beating mom and then like mom's
no longer holding the door shut
with her with her thunder thighs or
something
card reading a link to your future
for real i i thought that's how it
worked man
he's wicked messed up
it takes the polaroid with you what are
you talking about
puts the lotion on its skin or else it
gets the picture again
bro i'm just gonna tell you i want your
payout
i'm in too deep oh geez
okay saved
did you not realize that you lost the
polaroid or the negative every time you
went through that door
can i be honest with you i'd until you
you whatever good good gambian good
cambian
look at that look at what the heck is
this man
saved until you mention that i had no
idea um
that that was a thing sincerely
but god is my witness i thought turkeys
could fly
worse than the pod play so true so true
okay double up on this for no reason
and then the fool card all right we need
to find tinted skull
tinted skull
tinted skull is by boss okay bye boss
thank you thank you
for a dollar name a skull
i caved in i'm only reading this because
it's from ut edits this is dan's old
editor
you can't be toxic to them okay they
said
i finally caved and got discovery plus
oh it is right there are you still
watching 90 day
i do not watch 90 day
uh i don't make appointment viewing
if based on the flow chart if there's
nothing
cool on hbo because i'm very enlightened
and intellectual
um and then there's no sports that i
want to watch
i will go to tlc and often times tlc
will be playing
uh 90 day fiance but sometimes they're
playing some garbage
instead of a masterpiece something like
seeking sister wives in which case i
just go to youtube instead
i've been binging breaking amish on
disney plus
high tier empty um
so hey what's up with this bro what what
is this
left do not go in red portal left
left is it teleports you to the item
room maybe i'm so smart
but meanwhile an item will be like tears
up and then when i pick it up
and it makes our stats go up i'm like it
seems like it does nothing like
nothing's happening
hey you're not wrong the cake do be a
lie
stop stop with the name of woman stuff
chad
youtube for for nl um
nl annotated name a woman is a reference
to the youtube
comedy series billy on the street
starring billy eichner
you can go look it up for yourself it is
a
a a humorous show
and it's a great moment
one one of the all-time best internet
moments
next to jimmy fallon playing among us
dude we're here already there is a shop
on this floor
but have you ever considered that
shop this is bad
i'm in the corner watching you kiss her
oh i forgot we always gotta get some
vibes going here
anyway so that's i you know i got
nothing against the light life burger
if it if it gets you to try some new
things then so be it
do i look at it a little bit and say why
does this exist
nope not at all not even for a second
why does chad rat jam sag every time
i think it's pretty it's abundantly
clear right because it's a bop
it sounds like a john bryant on the keys
right now sort of did he but also it's
got some feelings associated with it
if you jam hard enough the feelings
can't get you
dude i love brian eno oh dude is bear
taffy here probably no he's probably
streaming right
all day long i've had um i'll come
running from another green world stuck
in my head
monday you'll see your dreams will pull
me through your garden gate
rasam
it's a great album i wonder if look i
know people are going to be like beyonce
but i feel like brian eno
might have had the most critically
acclaimed albums in the most
amount of genres
rock music pop music roxy music
electronic music and ambient music
that's a lot man
he's a multi multi-talented artist
producer
plus he made the windows 95 uh shut down
music
or the windows startup music maybe i
forgot
that's xp dude that's great windows xp
came out like 18 years ago
that's freaking crazy other thing is
pretty crazy
99 of officers on planet earth still
using it to this day
that big orange start button i gotta
tell you so
uh noted streamer jericho
tweeted um what i considered in the
moment to be a little bit of a hot take
he he tweeted the 1998
ford taurus has to be one of the worst
cars ever made
right in terms of its uh its styling
and he posted a picture of it and i
gotta say it's not a nice looking car
but my dad went my earliest memories
of my dad's car is he had a 1991 dodge
shadow
which was not a good car and then he was
so excited
he bought a 1998
ford taurus in candy apple red
from the local ford dealership i got a
lot of fond memories in that car
and i i let him have it a little bit i
said absolutely
false my dad had one of these and it was
like uh it was a bop
and then he posted another photo later
and said this is what the interior looks
like
and it brought me right back and i said
like if you find it the interior of the
ford taurus is genuinely
insulting like it it looks like an old
mp3 player or something like that
it's got big it's like the center
console is like a big
plastic oval and then it's got like six
radio priests like the things aren't
elated
or outlined in like a grid they're
outlined on like a
curve it's it's horrible man it brought
me right back
it's it's bad but i was blinded by
nostalgia
and i got to admit he's right it's a
pretty crappy car
but i will also say i believe that that
was the last
ford vehicle my family had a positive
experience with
no offense stan
crazy for taurus
please check the fiat multiplayer for
some truly r slash bad design
okay fiat multiplayer i'm gonna i'm
gonna look it up and just
just in 10 minutes when this guy dies
come on dude
okay hold on fiat
multipla
all right yeah that looks like the homer
simpson car
from the from the simpsons
what is it
all the ugliness of a van with none of
the functionality
the interior is somehow worst fiat
multipla
interior what
the hell is that
it's like it's budding man oh my god
that is that's one of the worst things
i've ever seen in my life
it looks like the fake car they give you
to drive at like universal studios
when you're in a ride it looks like a
it looks like a windows media player
skin or something like that man there's
love to have to turn my head
60 degrees to the right to see what my
speed is
it's a really good place for your uh
your gauge
cluster man that's horrible
that is is still sticking around in my
head that is horrible
oh the model 3 is like that too oh
that's true yeah because it's all on
that ipad in the center right
sorry not ipad proprietary elon tech
only do not steal
did you see the seats oh my god i didn't
fiat multiple seats
what the heck is this
man i don't know what to say
that's a real piece of garbage huh
well we might as
well use a cracked key here i suppose
see what we get it
is hideous man like it's yeah three
front seats and then it looks like when
you fold down
the middle seat in the front there's
like
10 cup holders on it like i
i guess everybody in the car can have
like two drinks at the same time or
something
like you ever be driving and you're like
oh i'm not sure which which wine would
pair best with my lunch
a red or a white well now why choose
just get the fiat multiple
named after the amount of cup holes per
person that are
available available come on man
hit by flies come on
that's painful for all the bubbly
anyway like it's i
look i don't mean to be negative i've
heard some bad things about fiat though
i'd like i've heard that maybe like fiat
and land rover have the
worst reputations of any of any auto
manufacturers on planet earth
for a dollar name a car
name a car
he's done it you've unlocked
the harlot
i would say it's probably one of the
most common
um i get hit at the start of this fight
like literally a hundred percent of the
time
the fiat 500 is one of the most common
cars you'll see in in vancouver
it's very calm excuse me excuse
it is fair to say this one's probably
not long for this world but
[Applause]
i i mean i can understand why you would
buy a fiat 500
in the city it is like one of the
smallest commercially available cars
i imagine you could park that thing
inside of someone's like p.o box
and and still have enough space to get
out without sucking in your gut
i don't know maybe we got a chance
goodbye goodbye succubus oh dvd
screensaver time i didn't even think
about it man
just just tank it i think i tank that
every time
i'm fortunate
look this hasn't been my finest moment
but we accomplished our goal
and to be honest i'm i'm pretty pleased
with the fact that we piloted this one
to success
there was some weirdness going on but we
made it work
did it did
anyway i just wanted to apologize to
to jericho and say that he is indeed
correct the ford taurus very ugly car
oh thank you thank you
pt cruiser is a hideous car i mean i
might say something that's like a little
bit
this might be the most controversial car
take that i have
um the reimagined volkswagen beetle that
came out in the
late 1990s and stuck around until like
2018
is uh is ugly
that car number one is ugly imagine how
bad it smells man
i i i do not like it as a car and i see
it absolutely everywhere
uh moreover i can't this was like it
might have been during the nhl playoffs
last year or like a couple of years ago
but they were like and now for like a
special announcement from volkswagen
and they did this like huge tribute that
was like
you know the beatles been there for me
for all of my life
and stuff like that i was like what are
you talking about dude it's a car
it's like a car that's like supposed to
look a little cute why are you having
like a funeral for it on the on this
broadcast
just it's just a weird energy
it's not a car man it's a way of life no
you're thinking about subarus
okay now this is pog
don't shoot
this is gonna be the first time
the for the first time ever he's done it
he's dodged it
there you go i just had to turn off the
banter muscles for a split second
now watch out these things will freaking
fall on you dude
dude i can't believe we actually did it
it's like easy and we bantered the whole
time
don't care didn't ask plus we bantered
you have unlocked zazekian um
slash marker name a woman



you're just joining us we've just
finished some jacob and esau
gig of brain co-op with daniel giesling
and i think that this is a unique
opportunity dan you didn't see that
i think this is a unique opportunity for
jacob and esau to not
mind flood us because we just had jacob
and esau
four of them on the screen this is the
one time
that regular jacob and esau will seem
insanely
easy to me we have to take advantage of
it
there's only one chance do not miss your
chance to blow this opportunity comes
once in a lifetime the training weights
are off
i i was like who gets this come on it
doesn't matter maybe it matters
maybe kamikaze unit should have it which
is for the best okay i'm gonna tell you
right off the bat
esau the world is yours it's mine it's
mine it's mine
yeah co-op with dan that'll come to
youtube um
it probably won't be uh
too far away from today
this is save yourself save yourself on
this one
pog we he's done it um
it probably won't be too far away from
today just because of the fact that uh
it's not cannon isaac as he would say
and as a result it's easier um to
to get it up in the pipeline a little
bit faster it was a fun section though
for sure i've done a lot of co-op with
with uh
kate before so i kind of i know the um
the basis and i know the understanding
for the most part i'm not saying i'm the
best co-op partner in the world i think
that would be
a misstatement oh help help
excuse me you know what
why not if i got hit by that it's time
to uninstall
we're playing a high risk
high risk high reward dude
the co-op with daniel is is heavily good
eats
i was telling i always tell you the the
non-sensitive stuff from the uh the back
channel
i thought last week rounds was a great
game
not 100 amazing for streaming for us
um and i thought can't drive this was
like the antithesis i'm not sure the
game was all that good
but for streaming it was like it was an
enormous bop and i think
isaac might have gotten the venn diagram
to be like a perfect circle it's
obviously an amazing game and fun for
streaming as well
the only downside is is the
technicalities but
we're uh you know working the turkey
through
one day they'll get fiber internet in
the midwestern part of the united states
and then it won't be as much of a
problem anymore
anyway moving on so we're leaving the
spirit hearts behind
send it we're leaving
really the spirit hearts behind for now
because we're just gonna go get him
later anyway we're gonna get him later
protect esau don't forget you're here
forever
dude dan if you if you are still like
doing stuff with jacob and esau let me
tell you
the double bomb technology is
actually like unbelievably good if you
have multiple bombs being able to use
them
uh at half price on the boss is like
it's incredible man the baby impression
let's go let's go
like that right almost knocked over this
bubble what the heck i didn't finish my
last can of bubbly
it's important because we haven't done
boss rush
oh warm warm bubbly versus cold bubbly
it's not even close man
give me that cold two of spades two of
spades
can of corn can of corn and i'll be all
right
warm sparkling water it's not all that
man it's not all that
you actually need a bubbly sponsorship i
think we got a great thing going on with
bubbly right now
um
every time i tweet about them
people get into their mentions and say
sponsor this man
but it is not yet at the level of
corporate cyber bullying
which is where i think you need to stay
if you want to maintain a good
relationship with the
with the brand
i think we're in a great spot
excuse me pardon excuse me
okay you should take this
no don't pick up the messages that's
what i'm saying we got it we got a good
thing going right here
sorry my eyes are a little offset from
one another it's hard to tell i i have
no idea what this fly is
but i'm happy to see it
i'm i'm all of a sudden unhappy to see
it because i think i'm not
gonna be able to account for how enemies
move but you know what
that's baby plum baby
baby baby plum
by the way thank you somebody on the
subreddit left a
uh an assortment of children's
television shows
that we may want to consider watching
instead of the bad television shows
when our daughter's old enough um
i don't know what greed sack does i
appreciate it
i have seen a little bit the most common
show that came up in the thread was
bluey
i have seen a little bluey it's about
like an australian family
there's like a breaking bad was up there
as well
it was kind of like um the episode of
bluey that i saw
was kind of like real but it was also
like a little messed up right
so in in bluey like the dad
he was taking his kids like they're all
like literal dogs
like you know because it's a kid's show
they're all canines
but he was like all right kids would go
into the dump and then he was like going
to the dump and he got distracted while
he was driving and like
you know almost cut somebody off or
something and his kids were like making
fun of him for not being a good driver
and i was like man it's like a that's
too real but then when they got to the
dump
he was throwing out like his old kids
drawings
or his kids old drawings i should say
and uh they like got caught in the wind
and then blew back into the car so the
kids realized that he was throwing out
their
their drawings and they were like dad
why are you throwing out our drawings
and i was like i was kind of in the same
boat
i was like yo if you're going to the
dump to toss out your kids old drawings
you didn't have to take them in the car
with you that just seems like
you know a recipe for trouble
also you should recycle this stuff mate
um
okay so here's the deal these are both
great obviously
jacob you need one of those jacob does
touch it i mean esau
esau touches it jacob touches that one
and then apparently
you get a stat upgrade
every time you buy something if you buy
greed's sack
if that anytime you buy an item or
anytime you buy anything
let's chat let's test it anytime you buy
anything
that's unbelievably good that's
insanity oh you got to buy it as
esau of course yeah my bad on that one
but still
that's like incredible that's so good
permanently 24-hour stat upgrade
permanently
might as well might as well it's
permanent oh my god
how did the episode end i don't know i
turned it off because i'm not four years
old
watch something for adults like 90 day
fiance
i apologize you're absolutely right
change the title
please revert the title to the balding
of isaac
and we're good to go all right this run
definitely has the potential
we got mom's knife we got great damage
on jacob as well
i've also i think i unlocked some on
youtube i think i unlocked some
tainted characters we could do some work
on
did you watch episode 4 of falcon and
the winter soldier
um if you'll excuse me i'm just my
headphone cord's shorten out here
there we go um so we will be buying a
new headphone cord
finally because i've been cyber bullied
by electricity into doing it
um i thought it was a good episode the
show
it's grabbing me more i go up and down
on the show i guess
i know like i apologize because i've
repeated the same take
a billion times oh the chimpanzee thanks
for the
gifted subscriptions you didn't have to
do that much appreciated
like i i almost find the show like a
little too
marvelly um
but i i it's not like a real criticism i
guess like that
the criticism i guess is that it's a
little bit too attached to the marvel
pacing and formula that i'm used to
um but it is also good
like i i like it's workmanlike is how i
think about it right now
you know it's not a show where you'd be
like oh you absolutely
have to watch it i think unless you're
super into the marvel cinematic universe
but it's a show where i'm like you know
i i have a good time every episode
i look forward to it every week oh mouth
oh beast first try baby
beast first try baby would you look at
that
he's done it now if you're watching
falcon in the winter soldier
what's your take do you do you think
that john walker is a
spoiler spoiler spoiler do you think
john walker is a spoiler spoiler spoiler
spoiler spoiler
hey excuse me uh i didn't get hit first
try baby dodge this guy first try baby
wormwood first try
but i i have a hot take okay
and it's it's a hot take that i think
actually some people will agree with i
think i'm slightly late to the party
um but my honest to goodness
hot take if you're ready for this
is that i think
disney plus will surpass netflix
in number of subscribers within the next
18 months
i think disney plus is gonna is gonna
usurp netflix in the streaming wars i
don't know
if it's gonna last forever you know
that's too early to say
but i think they are gonna at least it's
gonna become more of a fair fight
okay isn't it you make me spiky
i definitely believe that netflix has a
broader audience
for now loads of magnetizing tiers
i don't know if i should have done that
one but we'll see
but disney also i mean it's
the disney plus shows have been very
good so far
um for the most part or at least pretty
good
and uh
let's let's get both of these guys set
up
so so presumptuous you know netflix has
a lot of asian content you don't watch
so you don't know what you're talking
about excuse me my wife is watching all
those shows
this isn't on netflix it's on uh k on
demand
but if you want to talk to somebody
about the uh the hit korean show
the penthouse talk to my wife about it
okay
you think you know everything
okay hold on let's let's just have jacob
get it
are the shows good i'm gonna need that
person who accused me to leave the chat
first before i give you my honest
opinion
but i think disney plus i think it's got
a lot of advantages
like one is everybody knows disney as a
brand
and i also trust them to just like
basically milk every franchise because
that's what they're good at
but milk it in a way that is largely
like agreeable for people who
who actually enjoy the original property
to begin with
you know i think most of the people oh
don't get hit don't get hit
use the sun card if you can figure out
how to do it
most of the people are like you know you
watch the mandalorian you're like
i'm kind of being milked a little bit
but i'm having a good time you watch the
marvel
stuff you're like i'm being milked but
i'm enjoying myself you know it's an
enjoyable milking
i'll stand by that
and then like you might say what about
the live action like remakes they're not
for you
like not to be rude they're they're for
you know
undiscerning general audiences that
largely consist of children
so
yeah grab it then the other thing i'm
saying
is that they also
have a great selection of kids movies
including pixar stuff
and then secondarily i think people
really
underestimate obviously i have a kid so
i'm like in this uh
group now where i'm like nobody thinks
about you know what it's like to have a
kid but um i think people underestimate
the amount of
uh the the size of the audience out
there that basically just wants to be
able to like
you know pay 10 bucks a month and have
access to the entire disney vaults
i think that audience is large and will
continue to grow
and the other thing i'm going to say is
that i think people
underestimate the uh the actual back
catalog that's on disney plus because
they've you know rolled up every single
other
uh film company in existence up to this
point
don't hit me like that would be rude so
there's there's like a lot of stuff on
there man
i support it
i i think that disney plus will will get
closer to netflix than people think
i just watched monday's steak steak baby
monday's
monday's steak i'm just i i can only
base it on like myself
as a as a consumer i
very i number one thing i boot up is
cable tv so i can't be trusted
but um
i i look at netflix like last now
it just it it had its chance and then
like there's been like six months of of
just
as dry as a bone man
and then they had the audacity to raise
the price while it was dry as a bone and
i was like what are you
come on man i'm rooting for you here
we don't really want bumbo but we might
as well take both items what what the
heck was that other heart
yeah i don't want dry bones i want to
get
milked dude exactly
disney plus does indeed have scrubs
um if you're into that sort of thing
there have been times in my life where
i've been into that sort of thing
wait really yeah i'm assuming it's in
the u.s
as well but at least in canada disney
plus has scrubs
they also have all the disney uh
original series from like the mid 2000s
if you want to see like the origin story
of jake paul
and it i will say i i think i've been
talking up the disney plus movie catalog
a little much because it has uh
big trouble in little china which was
like exactly what i was looking for
however
i i went through on on the weekend and i
was like maybe i'll find a movie to
watch on disney plus
and i actually scrolled through the
entire list a to z
in like less than
10 minutes i would say from 100
uh and one dalmatians all the way down
to uh
like i don't even know xena warrior
princess
i got all the way to the bottom so
they're still trying to get some the
movie catalog needs a little bit to
to be desired for sure
probably zootopia yeah yeah probably
zootopia
but i will say hold on was um somebody
told me you should watch
like uh that netflix documentary
about the art heist can i get a a second
it on that one
has anybody watched that i i could
like can i can i tell you like how my
hobbies go
that one was good okay so like i've been
into investing
right i've read a lot on investing
online and both in print format
i've come to the conclusion i should not
try to beat the market and instead
should just invest in broad-based
index funds now that's awesome the
downside though
is that literally there's no point in
reading anything else anymore so i'm on
the lookout for
for new things to entertain me
[Laughter]
and uh as a result i've kind of lost my
hobby
and as a result i gotta figure out what
the heck i'm gonna do now like i i
but it's also the first time i think
i've ever had a hobby where i just hit
like an
end point that i'm happy with if that
makes sense
like i i i started and i was like you
know let's
buy some memes and then i was like
that's stupid let's invest in good
companies and then i was like
that's stupid invest in good funds and
now i'm like
no that's stupid just buy the whole
freaking thing man
so now i'm like why am i reading all
this stuff uh you know in my off hours
when i could be
you know cultivating another interest
this this is a little nasty up here huh
you're
you're a little nasty
okay cultivate soil i look mal i'm
jealous of the
of the value that you get from uh
gardening
i genuinely am oh we should get well no
we wanted that spirit heart with you so
that's fine
um i'm jealous of the value that you get
from gardening
i i don't get it like i mean but i don't
get it i i don't mean like i don't
understand it i mean like literally i
don't tap into the same feeling that
that you do
like uh when i when i'm gardening i'm
just kind of like
i'm just sort of annoyed like i just
wish i was inside
and it's not your is it you know i'm not
saying you're wrong on that at all it's
just you know different strokes for
different folks or
you know maybe i'm at a different place
in my life that's not not quite ready
for the gardening arc
but you know i'll i'll find it you know
or it'll find me
i don't have a lot of free time is the
other thing
i shouldn't make it sound like oh i'm
i've got a huge amount of free time that
i'm
it's really like the you know hour
before bed where
i uh have been reading we should just be
placing golden bombs this is like the
ultimate
nastyness there you go maybe we took one
out two out i'll take that
okay send it send it come on man
yeah the time when when the european
audience is watching the the stream
doesn't matter right
okay good stuff so far so good
you should get into the toronto raptors
if they move to the west coast i i could
be persuaded
dude this is tricky um
because this is a really good room
i think we have to get succubus for that
that
juicy juicy damage
no this is not the dan giesling uh
podcast we we don't need
uh a plebiscite for each item
i'm capable of of handling my own
business here
that being said i have been known to
make mistakes from time to time
[Laughter]
now and then and let's see if we can
just pump up some stats here
no bombo that's why you can't glance
you gotta live a glanceless existence
man
okay esau why don't you try why don't
you try that on for size
why don't you try this on for size
i mean i'm gonna get i'm gonna get
freaking funky man
no i don't so like i got no problem with
canada only having
one basketball team
i don't i don't worry about it all that
much like the way i look at it
vancouver like had their chance i don't
really know the
and i'm gonna leave kamikaze i think oh
we should have done that in the opposite
direction then but
um i don't really know the circumstances
that led to
to the vancouver canucks like not uh
existing anymore or having been moved i
should say
but at the same time i'm like you know
we had our chance that a team
didn't uh didn't pan out so be it
like if there were a basketball team
in vancouver i still would not
support the team
i mean i would support them i would be
like go team but i wouldn't like go to
the games or watch them it's just not my
scene
so the same with the white caps you know
i'm like i've still never been to a
white caps game
i hear it's kind of a party but
hasn't happened yet
nfl team in vancouver no like
i'm gonna here's something a little
controversial you know you won't hear a
lot of like west coast canadians say it
i think
if canada gets a sports team
in a league that they don't have a team
in it should like always be
toronto should always be first
they have a much larger population
there's no doubt
thanks for got it good luck with
highmore yeah i'm do it
honestly like got it he's he's the
better player in the trade for sure
um it is funny though like you know the
the canuck subreddit you know it's
supposedly full of like grown men but
there's like drama
because they're like oh uh did you know
beau horvath
as soon as the trade came in he
unfollowed
adam gaudette on all social media
channels and i'm like
and then they were like oh actually he
never
followed him on any of the social media
channels to begin with
and you're like dude we got to play some
games
like i understand why we're not playing
games right now because of covin
but at the same time like it's driving
the fan base even
more insane than they normally are so if
they could just like get over the covet
and then start playing some games i
think that would be beneficial
okay who you we we can get spun
on you forehead
i think we got to be a little more
cautious than usual here
donk donkey dunk dunk you know what why
not use the world card
and then hold this lover's card could be
helpful if we're going like full
alt path here blue jays are fun
man it's just like i mean you're gonna
make me say it again i just
wish real baseball was as fun as video
game baseball
if real baseball was as fun as video
game baseball then i would watch it
like every day
if you like it that's fine i'm not one
of those guys who's trying to like i'm
out for baseball like i want the whole
league to collapse i'm just like it's
just it's it's very exhaustive
it's a very exhaustive event
eight cents you know i mean we're doing
some rude things to our donation machine
and i will not
bro i needed that bro
excuse me bro please stop this
there we go dude all's forgiven bro um
i still want 15 cents
no no then we buy with esau
dude these are pretty nice stat upgrades
i didn't even realize
because i'm i honestly am a little bit
mind flooded which i think is somewhat
fair
let's just chunk these out of here asa
clubs
ace card is like good to just hold to
begin with okay the cards are
are doo doo um but ace of clubs is at
least like
there's some value there
but yeah that's that's my thoughts right
now i i'm i'm
well aware that once i finish reading
this like last investing book i have i
have to
you know go pick up uh
i'm gonna pick up some kind of new hobby
i'm not in a rush to figure it out
but uh we'll see reading's pretty good
man i've really been enjoying reading
i don't know if anybody else has
discovered this hobby yet
i'm not don't even get me started on the
people saying you should try reading a
real book
yeah so like a non-fiction book about
like uh a hobby is not real the only
kind of real books are about like white
walkers and
come on man ridiculous it's a ridiculous
take
try reading a real book stop reading all
that uh
a barbara tuchman all this uh
uh distant mirror kind of historical
nonsense
start reading the silmarillion don't you
know the all that barbara tuchman stuff
is made up
okay hold on ace of clubs two of
diamonds
two of diamonds well worth holding ace
of clubs the tower we say no to that we
hate it
that's a hp upgrade that's balls of
steel that's what i meant to say go
ahead and use it
okay go ahead and use it dude this is
it's too much to follow we do want
forgotten lullaby that's that's
for darn sure and then hold two of
diamonds okay
yeah yeah two of diamonds name a woman
sorry we we made it quite far into the
video before we said
uh name a woman which is that's that's a
distant uh
goal for us miss for a dollar can you
name a trinket
a trinket
maybe try writing a book nah
seems like uh like a lot of work seems
like the kind of thing that you would
like want to be all
in on before you
i don't think it's the sort of thing you
dabble in like maybe i'll write a novel
i think you got to have like such
unbelievable enthusiasm for it
that when you hit those moments where
you're like i freaking
suck so much i can't write a novel what
was i
thinking
that's when you then go like
you you use that reservoir of enthusiasm
that you had earlier to allow you take
like a night off and then you you get
back to it the next
day you know that's that's my take on
that
some youtubers have written novels bro
don't even get me started like
i don't know this for a fact but i'm
gonna say i'm gonna suggest that there's
a high possibility
many of those are ghost written and uh
you know if you've ever heard
kendrick lamar's landmark song
king kunta you should know how i feel
about that
i can't believe we didn't get hit there
you're telling me a ghost wrote this
book
oh dude really
what a rude spawn
this is a heck of a room with jacob and
esau man look at this
look at this look at this and yet we've
done it
all right oh they give me iframes baby i
love the iframes
i love to boogie on the disco
all right that was actually pretty well
done
thank you thank you for the claps
appreciate it hey mouth how about that
first try baby
okay now hold on hold on yeah yeah sorry
jacob this one's on you though okay
mausoleum sucks though
pog he said pog look at that yo you said
pog though
we really don't know what this pill is i
don't believe you
what makes you smaller one of the best
pills in the game bar none
the devil i mean two of diamonds is
better we're really just holding this
until we get the greatest cards money
can buy
for one dollar name a gamer
i can do this this is not even a
challenge
i it's a dead end it's not worth going
anyway
have you considered playing an
instrument as a hobby you know so kate
got a
like a an electronic piano a couple of
years ago
and i did think to myself maybe i'll
learn how to play the piano
i don't have a particular interest in
the piano but i do like music like i
know i've joked about it
i enjoyed music class in high school and
i i had a good time
um and i did win the grade 11 music
award
as well i might add and i did it without
supplementing it with band
which really just seems like private
tutoring on the taxpayers dime so i
think i deserve a lot of
credit for that as well um but there is
like
there's a catch this hobby that i'm
getting interested in
is it it has to be essentially
as a double to a diamonds baby reserved
for saturdays
it has to be able to be started and
stopped because of the baby for sure but
it has to be reserved for saturdays
and then it has to be done nights and it
must be quiet so that it does not wake
up
uh my baby so it's got to be something
like that
but i'm you know again i'll figure it
out for myself
but i'm just letting you know what's on
the list here
it would also be preferable if if it was
something that
i could do right before bed it would
also be nice if it's something i could
do
in bed
which is why reading is pretty close to
the top of the list right now
okay we're getting mighty low on hp here
what if he started a 40 season journey
through survivor
now we're talking now we're talking
a 40 season journey through survivor
before i do that though i gotta watch
all the medea films
i it's been on the to-do list for too
long
alert okay
bro this is like i needed a shop dude
are you seeing like all this money that
could be
no bumbo you don't get to have it let me
compound your money for you okay
there's something we could do we could
become addicted to gotcha games
okay i think the sun is worth holding
here's what you do
you two are diamonds control space
then you go back and you get the other
two of diamonds oh there's an item room
as well
my my
rainbow baby is not good enough
to not take the risk so we're gonna give
fruitcake
on jacob i'm not i'm not afraid
and then a little quad shot knife
oh baby a little quad shot knife
jacob doesn't touch it okay give me my
other two of diamonds please
and dude if our next shop has like a
reroll machine oh my god
he's on x games mode can i tell you that
i still think we're probably gonna die
to the to the boss here where the heck
was that other two of diamonds man
the heck was that other two of diamonds
it's on the left it's a large room on
the left can of corn
name a woman that's not a two of
diamonds
map oh left from the starting room
for a dollar name a corn
we were one room away
okay yeah yeah 80 cents that's good we
get the sun card
favorite kind of corn that's a great
question man like
pop is high on the list um
on the cob definitely up there but then
if you took away
the salt and the butter on the cob would
not be
nearly as good excuse me oh the sun
cards on the other okay
i just gotta you know you just gotta die
like you just gotta die quickly
just shoot
hey we're chillin
dude mexican street corn i've never had
it i would be
all about it i think i basically love
any food that's bad for you um i think
this would make us conjoined but i don't
think it's worth it
let's head down to the next floor
i don't want to do this room i'm i have
opted out i'm choosing to opt out of
this room
don't want it bro just go to a street
we don't have like okay i'll tell you i
see food trucks on the regular in
vancouver
there is a mexican food truck that i've
seen a couple of times
but it's not like um
it's not like what i want it's not like
tamales and elotes and stuff like that
it's like you know radish tacos i'm sure
they're good like i love a good radish
don't get me wrong but it's just not
like
it's not what i want out of street food
you know
stop stop moving stop shooting thank you
the heck is a radish taco
it's like a taco you know it's i mean i
just made it up like i'm not gonna
pretend like it was like a real
thing that i saw but you know i'm just
trying to
trying to spin some conversation here
you do have the radish on the taco
dressing don't get me wrong
like there's a i see a lot of food
trucks
on the regular like sometimes i'll walk
around and i'll be like hey
maybe there'll be some food trucks
nearby and then i leave and i almost
it's like i i feel like i'm doing a
social experiment like i have
money in my pocket and then i'm like i'm
gonna eat
the best street food that i can find
and then i usually come home with a full
wallet
unfortunately i i always leave with like
the best of intentions and then when i
uh
when i come back i still gotta i've
still got a full wallet
because i'm like i don't really want you
know
i don't really want like a a donaire
pita or something like that i'm mostly
looking for a snack and then they're
like what about like a wood-fired pizza
and i'm like i don't want like a
like a 12 wood-fired pizza to eat like
by myself
i'm just gonna take a chance on this
it's not bad it's not bad
there's a lot of and again this is like
it's not going to endear me that much
but it's the same thing as well where
like
a lot of the food trucks played to
vancouver strength and you know what is
vancouver's strength in that department
it it's genuinely like
you know meatless meals and stuff like
that so sometimes you'll be like you
know bet you won't believe
it's not a real hot dog and i'm like oh
come on man i don't want to
if you were if there was a hot dog cart
that i i came across
regularly i would probably eat
four hot dogs a week it would be too
much i'm not trying to say that it's a
good amount
i think i would just anytime i saw a hot
dog cart
i would be like let's get one
but when i you know the the street food
is like a little
sometimes it's not like there's a food
truck i walk by
now and then and it has like steps to
order like it's like how to create your
perfect
meal and it's like step one and i'm like
you already lost me i'm like
i'm just here to get something i can eat
with a napkin and all of a sudden like i
gotta have a
like a phd to understand what the heck's
going on here
i do love hot dogs man
i i can't deny that yeah i don't i don't
this isn't school just give me a
hamburger dude
okay this is this is nasty but let's do
it anyway
come on down oh dude we got the punched
here temporarily oh my god
okay the damage we're doing is is insane
whether or not we can actually uh
still finish the run remains to be seen
but just give me a second here oh my god
don't get sucked down to the void dude
i would i would never forgive you
that's my bed it's my bed
did not go super well there just chill
out for a moment the sun card is
insanely nice to have and i think
strength card is nice to have as
just well it just stop it okay just stop
it
they tried to suck me into the canada
portal i remember that reference
so reference to a little-known video
um called would you rather
we have no problem with killing power
like that's
that's no doubt if we could just get
some hero font cards like this one's
popping
that from a little-known video called
monday baby freaking monday
bro by the way i know i tweeted about it
but people have been like
last week people were like hey nl how's
your leg breaker video doing
i've gotten recommended it a lot um
and i checked on it and it got like a
little blessing from the youtube
algorithm
i checked on it again today it's
actually
on its way to becoming like one of my
most viewed videos of all time
which is kind of crazy
thank you
uh saved save yeah it's getting like
30k views a day right now
a little game called leg breaker um
where
you if you jump you uh let me put this
hold on this is like a whole ball of wax
man this is a whole thing
um okay
that's spun we also did not lose our hp
isn't that balls of steel
i'm not sweating that okay you still got
the sun card shell in here
um yeah sorry no you're right i left the
strength card behind
i have no idea what caused the algorithm
to bless me
um but it's
it's doing numbers man i even went back
and like i i left a comment on it
that was like hey if you like the video
make sure to subscribe every video i
make is exactly like this
just to try to capture a little bit of
the
of the the audience that's coming by
which i also think is
is uh why the video has like uh
a much higher dislike ratio than usual
is you're getting a lot of like
you know like let's be honest the
youtube audience
not just for my channel but just in
general can be a little bit
you know spotty and you know toxic to
begin with but
if somebody clicks on your video
to watch it because they like you
they're much less
likely to click like the the dislike
button
if somebody just finds you from the home
page they're
it's like they want to go in and be mad
to some extent
anyway but yeah it's still traffic you
know it's people that wouldn't
it's like an audition when i when i come
out with an isaac video and people are
like i hate it i'm like man i really
messed this up
when like 700 000
new people watch something and 10 of
them are like i hate it i'm like okay
that's 90
of the that audience that i didn't have
access to before appreciate your service
okay good stuff good stuff
yeah like i was watching a video it was
funny i again this is tangentially
related to
investing i apologize but it's on its
way out right
um but i was watching his videos like an
interview with jack bogle
basically the guy who popularized
index funds uh and it was like an hour
long interview with him sharing all his
wisdom
and it had like 3 000
dislikes and i was just like who who
would like
seek out this video like the only person
that would seek it out is someone that's
interested in it to begin with
and then they were like i uh
thanks for sharing or whatever but like
get bent
[Laughter]
it's just it's just you just humorous to
me
i just think it's funny oh my god okay
to get hit twice was bad to get hit for
a third time would have would have been
truly devastating
no i'm with you i think it was somebody
that like you know
their vanguard fund went down like point
four percent
in a single day and they're like this is
ridiculous
disliked that'll show that 96 year old
man
who probably like
has no idea where this interview is ever
gonna end up to begin with
okay okay we there's there's a shot on
this one but it's tough
it's tough man okay control q first
good stuff a little little q quickly
that i mean
if you dodge that you're the greatest
player in history
okay i'm trying to get the players
synced up a little bit
that was so much damage and remember you
you got a heavy control space coming out
that's the fastest i've ever beaten
phase one there i think
there's a better phase one than the
incredible hulk starring ed norton i'll
tell you that much dude that was so easy
i i told you what did i tell you
it's definitely the fastest i've ever
seen that done oh my god
you have unlocked magic skin all right
slash
marker jacob and esau alt
path



like a new character so i did unlock
tinted forgotten
oh you know what i didn't play as tinted
lilith last time
piping hot ice cold
but if it's for if it's freezing cold
oh my uh shouldn't it be burning hot
like oh my god this tea is burning hot
but that sounds stupid for some reason
can i tell you um i immediately
like this better than uh
than regular lilith
what can i say lilith has
in case you're not aware we have a
history like tom wilkinson said about
kirsten dunst
at the the pivotal uh turning point in
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
um i have a history with uh lilith
i uh historically don't do very well
with the character
um i i find just only being able to
shoot incubus kind of annoying
so this is like right on my alley right
now a little higher damage
oh you can also hold that attack button
out there for for a little familiar huh
it's kind of neat yeah this this seems
better to me you know what let's just
beat the alt path first try that'll be
sick right
doesn't seem to grab items unfortunately
yeah dude new characters oh man
i want to see some synergies with this
too it's it i'm not gonna say it's not
gross it's a little gross
i'll give you that grossness
i hate watching it and i can usually
stomach this kind of stuff
hey man like come on if you can't watch
your little cartoon
lady shoot her unborn fetus out of her
stomach to do damage to
you know little poops and stuff like
that that's pretty weak
i mean come on
i mean you're gonna have a long life
ahead of you if you can't stomach that
sort of stuff
have i told you about the poop yet have
i told you about the poop i found on the
highway
i'm just joking it's a call back from
yesterday don't don't be mad
or be mad that's fine too
oh what the oh you know what 12 cents uh
we don't have a key we don't have a key
to do all path okay let's go do alt path
wait let's go to the curse room first
congrats on the turd commentary clip it
has
lots of views how many views does it
have
because that will indicate to me whether
i
uh delete it or not
lots a billion that's a lot
it is a hundred thousand views
we gotta try this sack
well look at that it has 10 000 views
i mean you can i can always tell like
under
10 views is like that person made it for
like personal use which is fine
um 10
000 views is like somebody made the clip
posted it on the subreddit
and then the subreddit liked it and and
maybe shared it a little bit and thought
it was funny
and then uh when you see clips that get
into like the 50 000 plus
that's when live stream fails has has
posted it to the subreddit
that's where it gets like uh you can
always tell like you
you can reverse engineer eclipse
virality
it has one view it was uploaded at 6am
this morning yeah have you seen it it's
hilarious
what the um
i don't know what hit me maybe it's
some tier visibility thing um
but also i don't know what happened on
that room
i said it before oh poop through corn
okay
okay poop through corn i'll be okay i
said it before like i know live stream
fail is like
super toxic because but that's because
like
the the whole subreddit exists at this
point more or less to just funnel like
meaningless streamer drama up to the top
and you know create arguments for people
to waste their time on planet earth
but whenever my clips get posted there
it's like the exact opposite
because i'm not like essentially when it
comes to like the cool kids club of
streaming
i'm a nobody so for the most part i can
say whatever i want about any streamer
and it would never be posted there
you know what let's try let's try
something funky here
wow it got stuck on the spikes man so
whenever anything from me is posted
there it's just like
it's just a funny clip and people go
like wow i've never heard of this guy
but he's hilarious and i'm like thank
you you know they took the
literally the funniest moment out of
context
from a week's worth of streams and then
posted it
and people are like this guy's the
funniest streamer i've ever seen in my
life
we should have taken holy water that was
my bed
totally my bad on that one
funnier than most streamers oh
absolutely funnier than all
i don't know man hassan is his humor is
underrated he's a very good uh
he's got a quick wit and
he his uh his rp is is very good
i'm always impressed that it well i was
gonna say it doesn't just rely on him
doing an accent but i guess
he's not really italian in real life huh
i think there's some good moments there
i just can't watch the just chatting
portion of his streams because it
makes me feel like you know normal
people felt when they watched
uncut gems
like when i watched uncut gems i was
like this owns
everybody else was like i was i felt
like my whole body was like
with electricity and had ants crawling
all over it i didn't understand that
take until i watched like
hassan talking about politics and then
somebody in his chat was like you know
said something he disagreed with and
he's like hold up hold up and i'm like
oh no here we go
i'm like i gotta get out of here i don't
mom
mom can you pick me up
range that hurts
okay
mom can you pick me up someone in
hassan's chat just said if you don't
like
minimum wage why don't you just get a
job that allows you to make more money
i'm scared
he he stopped eating the reply to the
comment mom i don't think i have much
time anyway i
look okay that's a little too familiar i
apologize
just take the spirit hard and get out of
here streamer ranting
chib's funny too i'm like i'm still i'm
trying to capture some of that energy
i'm not quite there yet i'm i'm like you
know when jeff goldblum
tries to make that like clone machine in
the fly but he ends up you know
like turning into like a man made of goo
that's like my sense of humor right now
i'm i'm just not quite i'm i'm half
dennis miller howard stern
needlessly vindictive and like over
literary references that have like 12
footnotes attached to each joke and then
half like
um
i just you know you
get the idea
the inhale speech it did get me so good
when he was the that's one of the
funniest bits i've heard in a long time
when
he did the oh the mirror uh whatever
whatever we're bantering man we'll just
let's do a dark path remind me to do
dark path okay
what am i even doing down here now
thanks a lot chib well you blew it
53180
thanks a lot chib
when when when chip did the runescape
video tutorial bit with the internal
speaking i was like this i i can't even
come close to repeating it but it was uh
it was so it was the exact intersection
of my interests
funny voice plus youtube tutorials are
overly verbose
uh and and bad it was
and then it i forget who it was but like
somebody else in the call
was just like hey you know there's a guy
on ping and i was like yo
shut up this is gold
there's probably going to be a guy on
ping in five seconds anyway
you know you're we're never gonna hear
this again
tell me something i don't know there's a
guy everywhere
anyway that's all i got i think there's
some funny streamers out there i've i
haven't been shy about the fact well i
mean i won't name names but like
there's some streamers for sure when i
watch them i'm like what the heck why do
you have like
13 000 viewers you haven't even you're
just
you know eating chinese food right into
the
webcam you haven't said anything in
in four and a half minutes i'm gonna try
this i don't know how it works
oh dude it's like it's alien dude don't
think it's good for the record that i
think it's probably like
i don't know kind of bad but it is
humorous
that that matters to me yo atomic goo
thank you for the the outrageously
generous
amount of gift subs much appreciated
that is that's a lot that's ridiculous i
i do appreciate it
that's a great idea they should make it
so that
um give subs could also
go to like the same person like what if
one per you gave out
a hundred gift subs and like one person
just randomly got like 90 of them
that'd be sick dude oh and manak
thank you as well thank you
cool like we got one 90 month sub dude
wrenches i just came up with a great
monetization idea for you
what if people could pay to artificially
extend
their subscriber streak
you ever think about that
like right now there's probably some
huge egg fans that are like oh man
i was like nine in 2014 when this guy
started streaming on twitch i'll never
be a 60 month sub until like
53 months from now what if they could
just
buy 53 months worth of subscriptions
or hear me out here like a thousand
months worth of subscriptions
up front you ever think about that
it's a horrible idea yeah for you
for me is like i think it's pretty
sick it's quiet the the business people
are talking
that's very useful we're gonna die on
this run but that's very useful
nonetheless
wouldn't that mess with your monthly
paychecks it's a sacrifice i'm willing
to make
hello oh
my wife she hit me with like a a look
kate i have i messaged ross boom socks
about playing some league of legends and
he said sure
just hit him up with a time and you can
arrange something
what you
[Laughter]
i had a great time uh getting taught
league of legends by
by ross he didn't create a powerpoint
but he did get a five stack of people
together to like
to make sure that i had the best time
possible
which was very nice i'll
i i mean i think he's a pro in the same
way that like mercy's a rocket league
pro or
gotham is a professional chess player
look i i've already farmed drama with a
song today i can't farm drama with levy
either
that's all right no
no i just said i i like watching hassan
stream but i get uncomfortable when he's
in just chatting because he
he'll go off on a chatter usually
deservedly but still
i'm always like it it's like watching
you know the end of the
last episode of uh
falcon and the winter soldier hey you
were like oh don't do it
don't do it that's kind of like how i
feel watching hassan
beat down a chatter
down to the next floor
okay what do you think about my idea to
make it so
people could buy artificially and extend
their subscriber streak
so like right now you you might have
somebody that's like a one month sub and
they see like 60 month subs and they get
jealous
what if they could just buy
59 months raise you know
for for 295 dollars
they can do that wow you heard
no that would have been a
quite a controversial hospital
experience if this was what you were
doing in the hospital
all i'm thinking right now is how i'm
going to fill out the youtube checklist
and
100 say there's no sensitive content in
this video
[Laughter]
because they ask very specific questions
do you use firearms in this video
no you know is there do you pull a prank
in this video is there a mean-spirited
prank
nowhere does it say is there
some grotesque you know tim burton in
beetlejuice
imagery of uh an
infant yeah a little blood laser
shooting out of your
your womb not nothing nowhere in the
rules does it say that a dog can't play
basketball and nowhere in the rules does
it say this is not safe for work on
youtube
what
she she did a two-hour long nursing
section
session that's crazy that's too long
you're you're probably you're drained
right now in more ways than one
that's a long session no doubt about
that
we got to get all three items
that's still really good i can't be mad
but oh man the comedic timing really
knows no bounds huh
every single time
oh kate did i we we just had an
incredible run we unlocked new stuff
i mean this is this is a new character
right here
not sure if you can tell
i did play isaac with dan you know
oh because you and i have played
together before
um i think that might be true
honestly it he held his own i got it i
got to be honest
although i will i made the i don't think
it's dan's fault but just any time
you're
in co-op with something that you've
played so much yourself
like it's hard for me to keep my
emotions in check
because i'm just like what are you doing
you're not doing it the way i would do
it
no not at all like i i think literally
not at all
i hope
okay this this you never know you never
know look at this look at this
that's pretty solid i have no idea how
that's going to work with this probably
badly
you're welcome just you just need some
time to chill
i understand
dan cried after he left driving through
downtown detroit begging for the
location
of the heart room through text
you know what we could have joker
deviled for the present
it's not a bad idea in fact it's a
better idea than what i did
that's a good question oh no you cannot
use nod leaf with a little
familiar out i i just tried it right
there
that would be sick though
bro that hurts
that would have been incredible
i'm not shy about citing nba copy pasta
i believe that the national basketball
association has the best memes
out of out of any league
i'll be honest like and and there's so
many fans of the nfl this does not hold
true for everybody
but people who are fans like the number
one thing in their twitter profile is
being a fan of the nfl
or god forbid college uh football scare
the crap out of me
baseball fans my my stereotype of them
is that they're all
400 years old um but apart from that
just chill you know they're like for the
most part that you sit down you get a
couple of
sodas you know you watch the game with
some peanuts or something like that and
you're just
enjoying life right
college football fans like
all they tweet about is vaccines that's
it in in my limited experience of having
been online
since i was born um
of course i'm gonna take it
good stance go up band stance go down we
don't sweat it
i'm proud of apollo for for tweeting um
that people who are you know concerned
trolling about the
johnson and johnson vaccine are stupid
and
shut up i was laughing when i look
it's i don't know i mean there must be
like i don't know if it's a botnet or
something but like
there were like 17 hidden replies that
were like
stupid is that why you're called dumb
dog so stay in your lane you know stuff
like that i was like man what the heck's
going on there's like some kind of
sophisticated
operation oh there it is
it's a really good item man it's a
really good item
it's melvin capital there's gonna be a
short squeeze on astrazeneca
this is amazing intel
more fights happen at college football
games than at fight club
dude that's crazy i believe it
but you're not supposed to talk about
fight club i thought we mentioned that
um
this is kind of like the central tenet
of the
the club to begin with um
i don't like i don't think a sport like
turns anybody violent really i just i
don't know it's just when i whenever i
see someone
and can i tell you something else
occasionally i've seen it with people
who are like
their their
photo on twitter will be like of their
kid in like a high school football gear
and they're like proud mom of a texas
quarterback
and the stuff that those people i catch
him saying and
on twitter will make your head explode
that's it's actually like the younger
the football that they're interested in
let the scarier the opinions they're
willing to admit publicly
it's crazy people are just wilding out
you're like you got your kids picture as
your profile photo when you're saying
this stuff
i don't know that's
it doesn't mean if you have your kids in
your profile photo that you're like
a bad person only if they're wearing a
football helmet obviously i don't
actually believe that for legal purposes
but
i'm not drawing conclusions i'm merely
presenting anecdotes okay
yeah i don't know i mean like hey apollo
loves football he's a gentle soul you
know
unless you catch him on the wrong day in
pubg
or on airship um
so it's not all football fans
there's crazy hockey fans too including
like from
uh from vancouver vancouver fan base
pretty bad
honestly
probably already like uh tilted from
paying their rent every month
i mean geez louise have you seen the
rental market lately
we did have uh we did have a riot i did
i would
i wasn't there for that i i had actually
at the time that the rocket
or the the riot happened i had not lived
in vancouver yet
i hadn't even been to vancouver yet so
when people blame me for the riot i'm
like a good one i didn't live here dummy
those were all locals they've been
pushed out by the real estate market so
if anything
even if we won the stanley cup they
probably wouldn't even do a parade
anymore because
nobody actually lives here we just got
condos full of like you know
1200 square feet bank accounts
good alibi yeah yeah yeah
no people are not nice to each other in
vancouver it's it's the
one of the exceptions to uh
the canadian politeness uh
law vancouverites are not i mean they're
not
openly rude to each other i mean i'll be
honest with you like
a lot of the stuff that happens on
public freakout
you ever watch a viral video and see
someone get hit
and you say like you know good me
neither but like
were i to hold that opinion occasionally
there's a lot of videos that come out of
vancouver where the
the people who suffer negative
consequences
to me kind of seem like they deserve the
negative consequences like it kind of
seemed like they brought some of that on
themselves
it's like they bought a ticket um
to uh sit in the splash zone in sea
world
and then they said to themselves i
didn't know i would get wet
like it's it's in the rules and
regulations
skull is next to the item room thank you
thank you
yoink
oh yeah vancouver has the highest
percentage of supercars per capita
in north america um
it's 100 i see uh
on a daily basis just see like a
staggering amount of uh
wait i'm doing dark path yeah what am i
doing here thank you thank you
a staggering amount of nice cars
corey hey hey he they know about the
bugatti man they don't need to know
about the pagani zonda
okay like i'm trying to maintain the
illusion of uh
being in need here hold on i might be
able to donate a little bit
but you get like desensitized pretty
quickly you're like
like i don't turn my head for a porsche
anymore or like a maserati or
anything like that do you see a ferrari
though you're like oh
you're like oh a ferrari or a mclaren
that's where you turn your head
or i would for a fiat multiply
i would turn my head you can't miss it
how do you feel when you see right hand
drive cars in vancouver
i always feel that that's a person whose
favorite movie is the italian job
or alternatively like they're like a car
collector
like when i see like a nice car or at
least what i can recognize is a nice car
and it's right-hand drive i go you know
what that's probably
you know they either imported it or
maybe they used to live overseas and
they loved their car so much they took
it over
sometimes you'll see like like a right
hand drive honda civic
or something like that and you're like
what's your deal like
probably cost you more to like get that
than than the car's price to begin with
it's like sentimental value or something
i don't know
bass driver
okay we're going dark path dark path
saved i have not seen the video of uh
the guy sucking on his girl's toes at a
red light
where would it where might it be
possible for somebody to find this video
can i say something at least it was at a
red light
if that was on a green i'd be very upset
at a red
i mean look i don't think you should
tickle somebody's feet while they're
driving it seems like it has the
potential to go very very wrong
but if you're gonna do it i do
appreciate waiting until
the car was hopefully stopped
plus you're not supposed to eat while
you're driving
or be eaten probably but that goes
without saying
how do you feel about people brushing
their teeth on their morning commute
i'm like dude
you got to be careful about the way you
phrased this okay distracted driving
is like one of the the habits that
drivers have that actually
like makes me the angriest because
it just makes no sense to me
to the best of my knowledge i've never
gotten
bored while driving and anytime i've
been like
slightly bored i'll just like turn on
the radio or something like that
but i'll i'll be walking around and
people like or
i can see out my window like when people
are driving probably like
one in eight people uses their phone
at every stoplight that's crazy dude
like you i mean
there's so many things i have like a
problem with there
one of them is like you literally like
can't just sit still
for like three seconds at a stoplight
without like distracting yourself with
like oh let's see what's like on twitter
or whatever like that's crazy
and then like a smaller proportion of
people
uh
use their phone while moving and it's
that's like
truly crazy to me like i'll see them
kind of like they're pulling up to a
stoplight or something and they'll be
like looking down at their phone
and like adjusting it for like three
seconds and then they'll look back
up and i'm like dude that's enough time
for like you to get in some serious
trouble
now we're not talking about like you
know highway speeds here but you can
still
cause some serious issues
i'm like i'm i don't know man i don't
know if it's because like maybe
i again this is not a built different
bit but like
i learned to drive um
you know prior to the advent of
smartphones so that like
i mean if you distracted driving in like
the 90s you're actually just like
you have a problem were you reading like
a magazine while you're driving like
that's just crazy
can you imagine like getting hit by
somebody in a car because the driver was
reading
you know the economist
but or yeah stretching out their map or
something like that
i don't know i just like i don't get
bored while i'm driving i don't drive
that much admittedly but like dude just
get an audible subscription it's like a
lot cheaper than uh
dying
although if you have to buy extra
credits it might be worth just biting
the bullet and
leaving this mortal coil when you get
the credits for free
like for for free air quotation marks
that's one thing
if you gotta buy credits yourself i
don't know
we'd have to subject that to a more
rigorous analysis
i am going to say by the way if we win
this run
this is one of the the craziest runs
we've ever won
this it's actually really bad it's kind
of horrible
um the damage at least is good but the
actual like
tear effect is bad and i know people are
like why don't you just uh like tap
fire the baby well brimstone like raised
our minimum
requirement to shoot the baby it takes
like three seconds to
to actually get it to leave the
to leave the it's its carapace
brimstone did what to my run
there we go um
sadly bad but
magnus played what in response to e4 i
went the wrong way
this is not this is the kind of run
where i focus too hard on the banter
it's all right we can still do we'll
just do void instead
streamer's brain ruined his run
brimstone did what to my brain
you won't believe what she said when she
was asked to name a woman
i love the when people get like somehow
they end up
30 seconds behind in in the the
video feed dark path oh no
yeah even talking while driving man
like i obviously like i mean i here's
what i
i would like to think that i prioritize
the driving over telling a story so like
if i'm trying to explain something to
kate
while driving it really does it ends up
being like
you know hey what do you wanna like
maybe the drive-through and she just
pieces it together which i appreciate
but it's also like it's kind of hard to
like listen to a conversation and drive
simultaneously
there's been times where like i'll be
driving on the highway or something and
kate will be like what's
like 36 times 1.1 and i'm like
can we can we table this discussion just
until like at least until we get
off the highway
it's actually that was not that hard of
a mathematical calculation but when
you're driving on the
the mean streets of vancouver you know
even taking away a little bit of your
brain capacity temporarily can
it can cause you a mega problem man
it's not that hard my dad managed to
argue with my mom in the car for 30
years
i don't know well that's happy
anniversary to them i suppose you know
i don't have any like recent driving in
vancouver stories
there's one i can't remember if i uh
if i said it but like i i drove
uh a distance you know maybe like half
an hour away
and on my way out i saw somebody turn
the wrong way
into a lane so they were driving in the
head-on traffic and i was like oh that's
weird you don't see that every day
and then literally on the drive back
coming in the other direction
somebody did it again at the exact same
spot and i was like
that's where you start to find yourself
getting a little bit concerned that
you're like
i just saw two people in the same day
you know think that we drive on the
right side of the road
and then the bike paths are are are just
uh remarkable
like i've seen people turn into the bike
path with their car
which is like very narrow for one but
then now like the other thing i see all
the time
is i see like joggers in the bike path
and i'm like don't flatter yourself
come on like you you seem like you're in
good shape but there's no way you're
keeping up with a bike
dude like corey have you seen this like
it's like a new thing now people are
like they're jogging in the bike path
have you heard this have you heard this
one
saved still saved
did you see the lady who washed her car
with gasoline i did not see that
sounds like a thing people would do and
then like
the other thing is people like thinking
that the bike path
even though it has a picture of a bike
painted on it
they think it's just like kind of a
bougie sidewalk
you see them sometimes like they'll
cross the street and try to figure out
whether they're supposed to walk on the
on the sidewalk or on like the the
tarmac
with the bike painted on it and they
just decide to walk on the
on the bike path and they're like
holding hands and stuff like that and
you're like
look i'm happy for you you're you're
about to get clipped though
like and you know i don't know if maybe
they just take the attitude like well if
i get hit it's their fault but it's like
kind of not
click that clipped and shipped
good stuff yeah i don't like this shared
i mean of course like
it's like some places don't need it
right but in areas with like a lot of
bike traffic
i guess we're just done huh didn't he
want to do dark path yeah we caught
we covered this like minutes ago okay i
was bantering i was doing
ah and for thumbnail faces and i went in
the wrong direction
at this point there's nothing you could
do about it i could go play the
self-sacrifice room but i don't have the
hp base
to actually be able to play it enough to
possibly send me to the dark path we got
to find an infinite amount of spirit
arts which is why i went into the second
room over the course of the second
secret room over the course of this rant
okay anyway hold on lucifer was all
around me i we're not getting enough
spirit ours to play it i think i think
we're
i think we're toasted let's give it a
try though
good start good start
but like um oh duality
oh no well at least it only took half
let's go let's go pop the empress man
we're chilling in here
um like it's obviously it's better to
have like a separated
sidewalk and bike path but obviously
it's also like
that's overkill in a lot of places
probably um
but all that being said that
the solution that is very bad is you
know
bikes and joggers oh that was
that was amazing i'm a genius bikes and
joggers on the same uh
path uh
and a lot of traffic that's the worst
okay seven spirit hearts please oh
baby he's actually done it
i kind of can't believe it but he's
pogging the anger has given me strength
it's a bit of a zany run here
delete the reaction screenshot
greatest second secret room of all time
something like that
oh wait uh excuse me if you'll excuse me
there we go oh dude that's what a ripoff
man
what a rip-off then we got the gimpy
uh the heart from gimpy dude come on
i guess we'll just like i don't know
fight mega satan or whatever like it's
hard or something
um yeah sure that'll be fine uh
yo bro he's got a knife
i'm gonna be straight up with you i feel
like this is actually
uh never mind it's incredible at dealing
with a single enemy
at least
[Laughter]
not an amazing synergy with brimstone i
think i don't know
it's it's weird okay that's pretty nice
my baby's holding a what
name a weapon miss for one dollar can
you name a weapon
name a weapon any weapon a weapon
the meme synergy is being reached huge
item
honestly probably game-winning it's it's
so much fun it actually like
if i could double it i would d20
okay yeah let's let's do it man huge
huge item tears down is actually good
with mom's knife so
i wouldn't describe it as a mistake i
would describe it as
happy little accident
tomorrow hello my
my tomo son i'm gonna i'm gonna open the
door to let you in
you just gotta give me a moment okay
because it's a little
it's a little spicy right here tomorrow
how did you get out there man
hold on hold on come on how the heck did
you
how the heck did you get yourself out
here buddy
hey don't go in the courts okay
just get just get in the box man just
get in the box
reject the box box rejected
somewhere you can't as long as you don't
get into the chords i don't care you can
go anywhere
but the chords all right
no i i glanced i glanced at them
what is it about cats that makes them
like wanna get in the courts
i get maybe the it's secluded
oh he's in the box now it's the the heat
of the computer maybe
you think cats can see through heat
vision
i can i i'm gonna describe to you
how i figured out that cats have an
incredible sense of smell right
like i've always been told that cats
have an incredible sense of smell and on
a logical level of course it makes sense
however the
yeah yeah we take however the
reason really that i found out that they
have
the example that i give now
is why would you take that key dude like
come on
when i open our closet
joe care no
which contains our laundry hamper which
has clothes that smell like
caden myself um
from downstairs tomo tomo will
run up and try to shove himself
into the closet before i close it
and he's often successful and it usually
takes like
literally i don't know under 30 seconds
for me to get what i'm looking for in
there
okay you should not be getting hit by
that attack uh we've
we've come too far i would prefer not to
do a victory lap
you know what we can actually use nod
leaf with
with the the fetus hanging out now
my god
i don't know how we would kill i don't
know actually it just seemed
could i like i i could bring it out
close to me and just have it like that
but we're gonna try to do it the
old-fashioned way to start with
now you just gotta fight delirium
where the heck is the spawn room man
dude where's my spawn room is on the
left over here really
that's why i hate having these curses
dude it's too much
ah there is
okay get blasted there's no curse
well my work here is done you didn't do
anything
didn't i lisa didn't i
okay it's good damage man
if if you use it your your baby right
here
you can get the knife cannon
he didn't get hit he's a god
the greatest of all gamers has logged on
it gives us not infinite range knives
but certainly much
longer range knives like look at this
whoa no i forgot i've got strange
attractor wait that's awesome
able unsung hero this run no question
one of the better items they've ever
invented
that's why i said like i shouldn't have
said abel was fun because like i find
winning fun
but sometimes you know for the viewer
when you know a runs gonna win you're
just like i i'm kind of like
tuning out and this run has been like so
obviously won
and the path so easily cemented for so
long that like
i'm surprised there's still people here
interested in watching because it was
just
so clear that this was going to be like
a no-life win
pride before the fall i don't i don't
think there's too much of a fall coming
on this one i'm just being honest
and especially like check this out
you think this will work
hey come here here he comes
[Laughter]
clip farming baby luigi wins by doing
absolutely nothing
and now even this this is the problem
with humanity right
because i'm like this is an easy win and
yet i'm still like it's not fast enough
i want to touch the button
well dude that self-sacrifice room ended
up being pretty swell
and then we just got to go to delirium
would it be funny if the if the fly ends
up getting the lethal hit
oh confirmed
attack fly strongest uh character in the
game
consider yourself clip farmed clip it
and ship it baby clips enabled
we have unlocked fool's gold which has
appeared in the basement don't eat the
brown gold
strongest fly in isaac
teens like crocs now
slash marker



hey let's try the tinted forgotten
i love this bit i love this bit
so let me talk my bit how do you work
i can't swap
maybe
what oh dude let's go
all right all right all right yeah yeah
that's pretty cool so you throw the
character
he's he's like a an infinite red bomb
that's pretty neat
i wasn't joking by the way apparently
i mean i i saw it on cnbc so you know
it's true
apparently
the three highest
consumer loved brands by teens
are nike which makes a lot of sense to
me
i see nike all the time everywhere right
um crocs
and chipotle one of these things is not
like the other
nike makes a lot of sense chipotle
totally believe it i even i like
chipotle that's not an
age thing it's just you got to have a
refined pallet
um crocs though so it sent me down a
rabbit hole okay and you're just gonna
have to go with me on this one for a
minute
but it genuinely sent me down a rabbit
hole i didn't think crocs exist
anymore not only do they exist in 2020
they reported like 450 million dollars
in revenue
which was 50 year-over-year growth and i
was like i think
genuinely crocs are becoming cool again
they were out in a big way like in maybe
like the mid
2000s to the late 2000s like 2005 to
2011 maybe
crocs were everywhere there was nothing
you could
do to escape them it was just crocs and
ugg boots as far as the eye can see
and then they became perhaps the the
footwear that took the most public
derision except possibly for the
footwear
um where they look like gloves you know
what i'm talking about vibram's
five fingers
i would still make fun of those a little
bit more probably um
the finger shoes yes but get
this man crocs i thought they were like
jinkos i thought they were like a
fashion trend that may never come back
or if they do come back it's gonna take
a while at least
i underestimated them like crocs are
still they're still pogging up
somehow
one rapper did a collab with crocs
really
i've always i've heard two things about
crocs one is
you'd always be like dude you're wearing
crocs and then people would be like uh
they're really good for gardening and
i'd be like yeah man but we're at the
club right now
and they might be really good for
gardening but we're at the club right
now so
sorry every as a streamer you have to
repeat everything twice just figuring
out how i wanted to play this
um and then the other thing people say
is it's good for restaurant workers
which is fair
i i don't know but i never
i've never been inside of the kitchen of
a restaurant
oh no see this like the run's already me
enough
and i've seen a lot of crocs so like
obviously people are using them outside
of that context as well
i'm just confused i mean i'm not like
mad
i just didn't know that crocs were like
back i honestly thought the article was
kind of a meme
so now like you know i know our audience
skews maybe like a little bit older
but if you're like a teenager what do
you and your friends think of crocs
like is that is that study possibly
legit let's not worry about the
the methodology of whether or not
they're like you know
third place overall they're all right
i like them they're cool they're no
high school kids don't do things
ironically yet not not the ones that
pick up the phone and respond to surveys
i'm 18 and half my friends own a pair
dude that's crazy i'm i'm like so far
behind the times
one of my friends says they're her
favorite shoe it's crazy man
i'm like oh my key
like i said i'm not mad like people like
what they like i've never had a foot in
the race
but i think for a lot of people out
there like if you were cool
in 2012 it's probably gonna blow your
mind
that crocs are cool you're like uh
they're not cool they're the least
uncool they're the least cool thing ever
well yeah guess what you're not cool
anymore buddy
you got a college degree how cool could
you be
okay just there you go
it's impossible
i would like to pick up the character
thank you
i believe you have my character
yeah these rooms are a little little
spicy with this character but you know
what
where there's a will there's a freaking
way man
it sounds like the 28 days later
soundtrack
saved
can you still throw the bone
unfortunately i don't i do not appear to
be able to throw the bone
bone bone bone
tell me what you're gonna throw
when you got no tears to to cry
oh you mean god speed you black emperor
but you can oh never mind yeah yeah it
turns out there's like a whole meter
there and everything my bad
i'm gonna forget that in like two
seconds anyway
not only can you do it you've already
done it
i i have listened to some godspeed you
black emperor or as i like to call them
um give me a second here um explosions
in the sky for people who don't have
adhd
okay down to the next floor you can
throw yourself
into doors to move faster how about that
i do like to move faster maybe this is
our new speed run strategy
constant eating
dude look at the speed
that's very good we could also just fly
though
no i haven't heard their new album and
i'm gonna stop you right there
i haven't heard their old album either
but i have listened to
lift your skinny fists like antennas to
heaven
many times
saved saved saved
there's a tinted rock in the mirror room
are those good for this character
i'm just joking we'll go back we'll go
back you can't hit me
i walked into the spikes man i flew
technically oh yeah i can't pick it up
what have i done
gaming
gaming
okay hey come here steven
stephen
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just wait for
wait for it wait for it
come on i tried to shoot it diagonally
man
yes
[Laughter]
saved
please don't call him by my name uh
excuse me we don't talk about army
hammer here exclamation point current
events
isn't he like eden people that's all
right we don't talk about it here
i don't know anything about the the army
hammer saga
except i think he might be eating people
like i saw there was like you know
leaked army hammer
dms and i was like this is so absurd as
to
absolutely have a zero percent chance to
be real
and then there was a news story that was
like oh yeah the lapd
is gonna like investigate him for like
eating people
and i was like
the the skull places the the skull
places the bombs huh okay good to know
was there any proof of that or was it
just a meme i don't know man i think
he's like blacklisted
i'm not saying the memes that he might
eat human meat are real
but like he appears to be
being treated by hollywood as if he eats
human meat
okay that that hurts that hurts when you
do that
it was documented well in the texts yeah
but like i i don't know i thought those
were kind of like dubious i didn't
realize those were like
those were ironclad they caught him in
4k i guess
yo that's i never even thought about
that thank you
so dream catcher will show you both
items
on the item room so you can see what the
question mark is
that's cool
they thought about everything in this
game
i went at them this is derek you
derek you derek derek
you okay good good you did good you did
good on that one
you're just gonna insta-skip the cut
scene anyway cap
what happened
what he's so tiny
i don't know about i don't know what i
was thinking on that one
he's so tiny man
tiny bony you know that one in the wine
makes me feel happy makes me feel
fine you don't know it it's a goo it's a
good one you should look it up
it's tiny bubbles
i only know it because they did a
challenge on the
season one of the u.s mole hosted by
anderson cooper
where uh i i can't get to the
to the special room um oh we can just do
it next floor because we got to go to
the mirror room as well
um where they they left a guy trapped in
a room for like 24 hours and he they
played that song over and over
to try to make him lose his mind
oh can i just go through
absolutely i can look at that i thought
he was throwing me
did he lose his mind no he seemed like
he had a pretty good sense of humor
about it
i mean didn't big brother did that in
like one of dan's seasons right
like didn't they lock dan in a room
overnight and just play
like jingles over and over or something
oh jeez
oh no
just pick your moment
thank god they don't turn you into the
lost what the
uh i don't know i don't know what to do
with them
anyway yeah dude the mole was it that
was like my favorite reality cross game
show
it was pretty sick
i was back with dude when reality tv was
like an event
i know people are negative on reality tv
but when there were only like four
reality shows
on like in history
and everybody watched all of them and
you talked about it like at school the
next day oh man
that was the ticket that was the good
stuff
yeah like first few seasons of american
idol
amazing race ram scream
few first few seasons of survivor
amazing race is still pretty cool though
there's sometimes when that show's like
on i'll watch it a little bit it has
some amazing viral clips too like
did you see that shot
like when the when the lady wouldn't go
down the big water slide
and her her husband was put in a very
precarious position of like
you know wanting her to go down the
water slide so they could win
a billion dollars okay it's probably not
that much but still
but also like not wanting to yell at his
wife especially
uh on like an internationally popular
television program
yeah that's a thing right like i don't
know man like
i give her obviously the benefit of the
doubt
she obviously has like a problem with
heights as do i
at the same time i feel like you kind of
like once you're on the amazing race
like once you're doing the audition
process
i think you kind of gotta accept that
like you're gonna have to face your
fears
i know it's like if it's a phobia it's
not that easy
but like you literally signed up for it
like you you kind of
i would be a little mad if you didn't do
it after that
but then oh the the food is the worst
yeah when they're like
you know we we're gonna have you eat
like a cockroach
and then they're like i'm not gonna eat
the cockroach you're like then why did
why are you on the amazing race what did
you think it would be just like yelling
at taxi drivers
that's that's only part of the show
that's not what the whole thing's about
i did i gotta go get some bombs dude
this is see like and i'm not blaming
chap but it's chad's fault i'm blaming
chad
i needed bombs in order to
get to the other path but everyone's
just shouting tinted tinted
tinted tinted tinted over and over
so i lost i lost you you spoiled my
focus
i'm gonna try the d100 i'm just also i'm
hoping
maybe you know what i bet if we come
back the other way there's rooms with
some consumables
we can do it ten to ten detented
just go to the next floor i will never
instead i will get
bombs right here we already got one key
so that's a good start
oh he just made him mad
there's a tinted rock in the mirror
realm
barry if you don't shut up about the
babysitter
i'm gonna beat the crap out of you
really
yeah no
barry i'm gonna embarrass you
he's done it look at that
he's done it now hear me out blow out
the
blow up the tinted rock it could be two
bombs
it's something something family guy
something something it could even be a
something something
and just on principle i'm not going back
for that tinted rock i refuse
i refuse don't skip don't skip
um oh but i rerolled
yeah so i don't have dream catcher
anymore
wow
anyway i forgot what i was talking about
oh the amazing race you can go into and
out of curse rooms for free
fool um
you think we can save a key here i i
can't reroll my whole run because we'll
lose the d100 which is the ability to
reroll your run many times
but yeah i was talking about the amazing
race i mean just kind of like
i would never be mad i guess if somebody
was like i don't want to go on the
amazing race
but if somebody was like i want to go on
the amazing race and then they're like
you have to eat
like a snake and they're like oh no
i would be a little mad i would be like
you we i took three months off from work
for this
for however long it is
all you gotta do it like ah i guess
everybody gets grossed out by like
different things but
eating is the one where for me i'm like
it just
tastes bad you're not gonna die you're
gonna be fine it's just it's gonna taste
like a little weird
and you're probably not going to enjoy
the taste so what it's it's over in like
you know less than five minutes
oh no
i'm not locked in here with you you're
locked in here with me
it's simple we roll everything no he
died let's go okay hold on
i think we're just reroll see how things
look
what what what
cool cool
bone cool boneman
hey come over here
dude we got good range cool boneman
look at this guy dude you think he likes
reggae
what the heck was that video that mouth
tweeted by the way that was like
daenerys targaryen reggae
did you see that
and he said this is actually how game of
thrones should have ended
what the heck was that video man and
also what was um
what was she thinking when she made it
it actually slaps
look i'm not really like a reggae
enthusiast to begin with i'm probably
you know
like unless it's modest yahoo i'm not
really interested
it's just a rule i choose to live by but
stripped of context i had no idea what
what malph was talking about
what the
it's from red nose day
i don't know what that is it seems like
a that sounds like a british thing
like is that maybe that's just what we
call like christmas over here
i'm sorry i know what it is i just
thought it would be funny
yo this run is great i don't know what
it is but it's it's got it
look at this you're just smacking them
man hey
rude 11 damage yeah 11 damage seems
pretty good
hey hey stop it stop it you
hey i got an idea let's grab this
and then let's grab this and
mash the button real quick no we're good
we're still good
let's go to our shop dude this run's
going to pop
oh it's part of a skit you know like it
it blew my mind when um
i found out that the idiot sandwich clip
is actually from a skit as well you
think it's this should make
the bone twice as big f
the hanged man yeah i didn't know it was
julie chen at the time
now when i saw what it was actually from
i knew it was from
i knew it was julie chen but in the gif
format chopped and screwed i had no idea
don't tell dan
the bone is you not a familiar
counterpoint it would be fun
don't tell harry did i watch like uh
last 30 minutes of spider-man far from
home
a couple of days ago it's still a pretty
good movie nothing wrong with that movie
it was on uh was on the movie channel
it sucks hey come on
just agree to disagree
okay uh that's it's better but i wanted
seraphim
so we'll just call we'll call that a
quality problem
what was the last movie you saw in
theaters no joke it was uh and this is
not that
long ago when you consider that there's
gonna be people here in
in uh chat that are like i haven't seen
a movie since inception or whatever
but i saw parasite in theaters
in december of 2019
see ya
that was the last movie i saw in
theaters it's funny there was a viral
tweet the other day that was
like um it was yesterday i think
uh also known as red nose day in the uk
um
it uh it was like look up your first
tweet with kovid in it
that references like the coronavirus or
kovid and there's so many that are just
like
you know they're from like march or
february or april of 2020 and they're
like
boy i'm sure glad like this coronavirus
stuff is hitting before
halloween like i'd really uh
can you imagine like how bad it's gonna
be if if this had actually struck us
around halloween instead and you're just
like oh my god
we were so we were so naive man
yeah that'd be bad halloween 2023 maybe
this is why i buy my halloween
decorations what am i supposed to not
buy my halloween decorations
yeah so this run is tinted forgotten
he's he's a he's a bad dude who doesn't
care about anything
i think you can forgive yourself because
i saw someone in chat say like
their their first tweet about kovid was
like i don't think it'll be that serious
we had conversations about it like on
the show i remember rob being like i
don't think it was that
serious like i honestly think it was
kind of the default take at the time
in hindsight everybody's like nah i took
it seriously right away
but like january 2020 a lot of people
were like
i just it's probably just gonna be like
you know sars or it's gonna be like you
know
one of those pandemics that are one of
those epidemics i guess that affects
like
other parts of the world but like not
home and then like
you know turned out to be like very
wrong
the people thought it was gonna be like
a bowl i mean the same thing i was like
i think i made a tweet that was like
um
it was like uh uh coronavirus when it
sees you leaving the bathroom
without your without washing your hands
and it was that
it was jim carrey in the mask doing the
like uh
the cuban peep dance and even back then
like one person i think
left a reply that was like oh this ain't
it chief like it's serious and i was
like ah whatever
in hindsight yeah what people didn't
know back
not everybody knew back then at least
hey hey hey
that person they had it all figured out
it was probably dr fauci
hold on hold on i mean people will take
the next hey i mean i know that this is
like not as misanthropic as chad would
like to be
but i think there's like a like a
recency bias right
like growing up there were a lot of like
you know potential pandemics i guess
that just
you know it looks like they never ended
up uh
it i guess the way i would say it is
like it looked like
mother nature just took care of the
forest then it turns out like it was
actually the result of like great uh
public health
outreaches or whatever um
or happening to just not live in the
location where
it was really hitting the hardest oh we
could keep peacekeeping keep these key
piece
um but yeah like you know the the
narrative around like that kind of
infectious disease
like like flu variants and stuff for me
growing up was like is
it was obviously wrong but it was like
it's a part of the world that like or
it's something that doesn't
affect like north america it always
starts someplace else and it's always
fixed before it gets to like my hometown
or whatever
but obviously uh that was not the case
here but i can understand why people
were like uh
it's probably not gonna be that big of a
deal i've lived through this like 20
times before
and then it was like oh no never mind
this one's actually like this one's
pretty bad
oh dude
look at this easy money
excuse me i thought you were me
you know
my bad
please hold r excuse me
you're joking right
you can't hold r in real life okay
you get into a position in real life
you take an item it gives you minus five
damage
you know what you do you persevere you
go down on the next floor you dodge you
keep it together
what what a ripoff dude
this is good this is good
dude being able to fly here is is turns
out it's pretty valuable
i forgot what i was saying a second ago
not about covid it was about
it was about something else oh it's
about holding r
yeah um i saw someone say in chat like
if you hold r after the basement you're
a resin
using coward you know what that
statement uh means to me
that there's someone who holds r on the
basement until they get a seed that
they're looking for
it's just as cowardly to me it's just as
resinous
it's got uh it's got the same energy
that you're trying to push on to other
people but it's it's related to yourself
instead
however i don't care how you play the
game
at all like if you're if you're chilling
and you just want to have fun and you
walk into your first item room and it's
an item that is either bad
or does nothing which happens all the
time and you're like i'm out of this
who cares no harm no foul
i do and and when streamers do it within
the context of a race i don't mind but
like
it's not my flavor when people you know
do it uh
on stream and just are like trying to
finesse like the best run that they can
get
because part of the fun for me and isaac
is that is that variance
you missed the key a couple rooms back
listen dude
listen to your mouth you're not an
intellectual
sorry i got a little bubbly stuck in my
throat at that moment as well
okay we gotta this is finesse oh baby
he's a genius
i told you not to talk to me until you
have pictures of spider-man okay
the heck is orange champion dude whoa
oh lucky me uh i i will not
be watching any gps this weekend i i
don't mean that to be like
dismissive i just don't know whether
it's a magic the gathering thing or a
formula one thing and we also we we
don't need to drop a trinket on this one
we're going alt path
oh they're not gps anymore they're
called mpl
in magic i didn't know oh no it's
so i i shouldn't even comment on the
magic uh community anymore because i've
already said my piece and like everybody
apparently agrees with me it's like the
least hot take of all time they're like
yeah there's some jerks in the magic
community
um but i did see like because i
you know used to play a decent amount of
magic i follow a lot of like magic
content creators and
i guess like loading ready run did like
a pre-release stream where they were
gonna announce like a bunch of new cards
but they didn't announce them until like
the end of the stream and they got like
cyberbullied
and i'm like man i hate to say it but
that's like i'm not gonna say what you
expect
because that's not what i mean but i was
like it's just the magic community has
some people in it that are just they
lost their mind man
they're just uh view baiting they don't
to i'm only here to see the cards
but they don't want to release the deck
because they know that people are only
here to see the cards and then like
filling up chat with like toxic garbage
bro just go to bed and then wake up
tomorrow
and there will be the cards and you can
look at them and be like over
overpriced trash you know like it's just
crazy
okay i didn't mean to get that just give
me a second
yeah just like just just log off man if
you're good you ever find yourself being
like rude in a situation like that you
just got to be like
well it's their fault for putting the
stuff at the end
it's just wild man
touch grass i do love touch grass
i and i honestly think the other reason
i love it is because i think it works
man
sometimes when i'm upset about something
i like go outside and touch grass and
i'm like oh
i was upset about like nothing man this
is like
literally like you know it's just cards
bro just chill out why you so mad over
cardboard you work in the pulp industry
or something
hello edmund edmond the game
ah nevermind is fixed disregard call off
the dogs
dunk dunk dunk dunk
don't take my knife
they took my knife at least they don't
take
my my bone lord that'd be pretty
devastating
what are you doing oh no
you didn't release tulsi god of the
witches after things precisely noon
like you said you were gonna instead i
had to
watch you miss play with freaking tafari
okay okay moving on moving on moving on
moving on moving on moving on moving on
moving on moving on okay
moving on are you guys getting an insane
winter storm there
i don't even want to tell you what it
looks like here it's gorgeous
it's actually like one of those
maybe one of the most beautiful days
i've ever seen in my entire life
it was great i looked out the window and
i was like
it was it looked like windows xp's
default background it's it's gorgeous
there's a glitch in the matrix the rooms
are repeating
bc has actually just been beautiful for
like uh
for a little while at least like the
last four or five days
it's just been mighty nice
it's a little chilly then i'm not
complaining because we got it pretty
easy up here
it's a little chilly like you
think that you know you don't need like
a
a light jacket and then you go outside
and you're like oh i wish i brought a
light jacket but
apart from that
apart from them it's been very nice
oof damage mouth come on man
come on now were you here when i was
talking about the rastafarian targaryen
stuff

defense

same jokes
um how about that
check this out dude
i've been hit regardless
you're right we should go to the cursed
room that's my bed dude have you noticed
by the way i think the way that this
works is that
does electricity actually get the tear
effect
of of whatever your tears are as well
dude it's it's catchy bass
this is the danny mode i was trying to
explain to him
he didn't know what i was talking about
not quite i might have it confused with
another
just another emote
it's gonna be a tough one to beat the
the final boss okay
that being said
i think we got a chance
i think tainted forgotten is is a lot of
fun so far
i'm having a good time
with what health i was just thinking
like what if what if i got like a lot of
hp just like out of nowhere
like for no reason

i don't know what did the damage there
but i'll take it either way abaddon abba
cannicorn

floor is this
you guys weren't joking joanna it's too
hard man
nerf it oh he's having a hard time nerf

okay drop one of these
drop one of these one of these
cursed room cursed room yeah yeah yeah
secret room
mal don't say you're the rastafarian
targaryen
it's that i don't i just don't
get it i guess is what i'm trying to say
like what's the joke the joke is that is
bad
right
mouth did you were you here when we were
talking about crocs you're like my shoe
guy
apparently like crocs are super cool now
yes yeah all the all the teenagers are
in chat they're like crocs are cool now
who would have thought man
not me chib wears him i was going to ask
i feel like and especially i don't know
though like isn't
because they're in the southern
hemisphere isn't aren't trends reversed
in
new zealand
like aren't they all dressing like the
matrix down there right now
he's right and he should say it
thank you post malone sells a thousand
pairs of crocs
what does this mean
post malone can sell a thousand pair of
crocs
what do you mean like he has
like a he sells branded crocs
he has a he has a he has a
a brand deal with crocs he has collab
crocs okay
so he has sold 1 000 units
or he has 1 000 varieties available
him alone give me some of your crocs no
get your own idiot
still a great bit it's a great bit and i
stand by it okay
dude this i told you this run could do
it you see how fast that was
there's no way you do this i know i know
what you're gonna say there's no way you
do this i gotta get out of here
and we gotta make sure we do this
properly
bro how am i supposed to do this without
throwing them in the hole
oh like that
[Laughter]
donkey donkey donker
yeah yeah like that i got it don't care
didn't ask plus you don't own any crocs
they don't make crocs in my size okay
this is pretty good this runs gonna work
hey nice shoes do they come in adult
sizes
is a large golden rock
hey
i will say the only other story i have
about crocs
is that in my first year uh chemistry
labs in university
one of my classmates tried to wear crocs
into the laboratory because you need to
wear closed-toed shoes
and they they made her go home
which is actually just like
understandable
i mean it's for your own safety
so you don't spill like hydrochloric
acid on your feet or anything like that
or like you know trip over something
you're wearing shoes with holes in the
top i mean what are you thinking
dude we're spun we're spun look at that
we're go we're actually going to win
we're not spun we've already been spun
name a transformation
do you know that crocs are underwear in
taiwan
well i mean they do seem breathable
have you ever worn a clog
someone in chat's like forget crocs man
let's start wearing clogs
they in in my daycare in like i don't
know i was probably four or five years
old
they had clogs i always thought they
looked cool i put them on
they freaking suck like i'm very happy i
was not born
in an era where people were walking
around with those at all times like that
your feet would be bruised forever
i'm dutch i hate clogs
yeah you guys should start wearing crocs
over there
no wonder everyone's riding bikes all
the time i'd ride my bike more often too
if the alternative was like walking
around the city and
freaking wooden shoes
no wonder they were the first
nation to make cannabis legal they
probably just needed some relief
this boss i feel like we will destroy
them
easily
okay maybe not perhaps i was a little
hasty
we can hit him a few times on the way
down at least
i guess can we throw him up oh we can
throw him up there there you go
no thank you although
if if it went around oh dude i mean like
it's mighty tempting
i think we're gonna i think we're in a
great spot i don't think we need to mess
with this
i don't know what my hp looks like
either i'm scared okay i'd
all my time's up please get my die due
to my own aggression
okay
i also need to update you um the
vancouver subreddit
has noticed that jollibee
is indeed opening in in the city proper
however it's not all good news um
first off is still under construction
secondarily
it's located in a part of the city that
i
hate uh being in proximity to
so
i gotta i gotta figure i gotta figure
out how i feel about that
i don't know if anybody here is no it's
not a surrey thing i would drive to
surrey to go to
jollibee um but
it said granville and robson
which if you look at it on a map you'd
be like dude that's like the center of
downtown what's your problem
it's like i mean
it's just not a fun part of the city to
be in it's
like i know
like people are familiar to some extent
with like the downtown east side and the
reputation that it has
that's kind of what it's like up there
but it's i don't know it's just like
more
menacing
like in downtown east side i'm just kind
of like un uncomfortable because like
you know it's not nice to see people
living like that
but at granville robson i'm actually
like slightly concerned for my safety
there was a time kate and i were waiting
for a bus and we were just having a
conversation this is like right in front
of where the jolly bee's gonna be
we're just having a conversation and
like some
dude came up to us and was like do you
like this city and i was like
yeah and he was like yeah yeah me too me
too
i liked it a lot more when it was quiet
and then like shove this pizza in the
garbage can and just
like really angrily walked away from us
i was like
what the heck's going on there
so maybe i'll wait till they open one in
like metro town or something
like that and then all
then i'll i'll try that delicious uh
fried chicken from the philippines or
something
yeah somewhere more pleasant
i mean this is like a really uh
it's tough to imagine how we're going to
run into too much trouble here
who would have thought dude we had this
is like the most successful
run i've ever well okay the most
successful run i've ever had
but this is like the most successful
portion of isaac on a stream i've ever
had
like it's just endless victories okay we
deserve to get hit there
like we did we managed to make it work
as tainted lilith as well
first try oh we almost did it too
bro get closer i just want to talk
thank you
please dad more isaac i'm just happy
that we're like
you know finishing the stream in a
reasonable time frame
usually we're like we have to we have to
force it
look at that hollow heart
he's done it slash marker two kind of
weird runs too
slash marker



all right i mean we're gonna run it back
as you saw like we should have done
pretty well because we did have seven
megas on the last run but let's do it
again
more like you're dead dancing by the way
can i tell you and i know
like we've already done an air fryer bit
check this out man
spark mouth sparkling water i got it
yesterday
at whole foods naturally flavored they
didn't have any bubbly because bubbly is
too
cheap they refused to sell it at whole
foods instead i had to get
spark mouth live taste test
it's fantastic it's honestly fantastic
that's delicious hold on
people are telling me that mary
steenbergen
won an oscar in 1991 for a movie called
howard and melvin like this
is how you know the simulations crashing
there's no way i how is it possible that
i have never heard in my in my 30 years
on planet earth of a movie called howard
and melvin
dim bulb i think it's broken
yeah yeah dude it can't possibly be a
gap in my knowledge it must be the
mandala effect
let me guess she played one of the
barons stained bears
i'm gonna say this is seven out of ten
jay at little burr
jay at i love it okay it's a fun
challenge man
that's my favorite item hey bubbly knows
where to reach me okay i'm not saying
i'm a spark
mouth main
all right it's it's actually horrible
but our stats did get much
much much actually it's amazing it's the
greatest item ever
the hunt that's also
oh no that was dim bulb it was dim bulb
that gave me the stats
okay we're going with the hunts man
melvin and howard has a 91 on rotten
tomatoes i mean that's that's pretty
good
it's a this is a highly good score no
wonder she won the oscar
tammy's mushroom ours collected
tears blood of the marty
[Laughter]
that is nobody tell dan that's so good
even the game has started speaking to
english it's it oh
geez i knew it you know what whatever
we already got hit we might as well
blood of the marty
oh it's always good
i gotta be honest with you this seem
pretty darn good
it seems like there might be some merit
to that
it's a one tap marty how about that
come on 36 chance of a devil deal item
that we don't want anyway
you know what we don't go in and then we
get a guaranteed deal with the angel
afterwards
three cd t dollar sign o
i mean that also seems half decent
honestly but
i gotta say low to the marty i gotta
give it a a decent amount of respect
here just because of its
description
he's learning
i just love a lot of the marty man
what you drinking oh i'm happy you asked
it's uh
spark mouth sparkling water
this is the strawberry flavor bro
bro please smash mouth sparkling water
this is the shrek flavor
shrek berry green grapes shrek berry
frick yeah
what's your favorite back to the future
quote i
like in back to the future when doc
brown says we gotta go back to the
future
i think that's an iconic quote
the afi recently said that it's uh
one of the top 1985 quotes from back to
the future
i was gonna watch more of the the
episode but i ran out of time
love golden bombs baby love golden bombs
baby
marty did you leave your lud back in the
old west
did you leave your blood doc
donk i think i left my lud back at the
okay corral
all right marty then we've gotta go back
to the past
great bit great bit hey man like okay
i've
i mean if we're saying things like
we might regret 1980s
movie trilogies
overrated insubordinate and churlish
back to the future one great movie
classic
back to the future too decent back to
the future three as dan says the search
for more money
karate kid one uh
good movie i'm gonna stop myself right
there
karate kid two not a good movie
karate kid three never seen it
doesn't even star ralph macchio has
stars hillary swank instead
doesn't make any sense the search for
more money
teenage mutant ninja turtles one good
movie
teenage mutant ninja turtles 2 bad movie
yes i know about the ninja rap and i
stand by what i said
teenage mutant ninja turtles 3
absolutely horrible movie
azuma's revenge
it appears to just be a shot speed
downgrade and i have received no deal
with the angel
i mean a lot of movie trilogies suffer
from the same thing like i i
it gets me in trouble sometimes but um
you know matrix one is kind of a
different story
like matrix one is good matrix three is
horrible
matrix two is bad but simultaneously
underrated
secondarily
uh star wars
star wars one all-time classic
star wars two even better return of the
jedi
one of the most overrated uh movies of
all time
don't add me i've already trust me i've
already been added
i've been added many many times
in the past that's the thing is
people
whyja a bleeder
uh i don't know what was happening there
i'm gonna blood of the marty goodbye
something about this seems really good
why i don't know why i did it
indiana jones i'm not
i'm not enough of an aficionado
stabudzwa
i'm not enough of an aficionado to have
a good indiana jones opinion
everything else i stand by
john wick
one great two less great but still
pretty good three heavily underrated
and uh disliked
people who think that if they have fun a
movie must be bad
like i i genuinely think there are
people out there that go to the movie
theater and they're like i'm having too
much fun
this must be a bad movie
dan thinks prometheus is better than
interstellar you know
it's gonna sound kind of crazy
i disagree with him i think prometheus
is bad
but i do also kind of stand by him
and like at least help me
at least prometheus is like
i'm trying to think about how to
describe it
what it does like it goes hard
interstellar i i enjoy i think it's a
much better movie than prometheus for
sure uh this is upper plop
by the way
but i i can kind of understand dan's
position
i am gonna take flying metal plate
that is fan all stats up uh
all right i guess i'll be fighting the
the angel then uh it's endlessly
spawning
enemies
and i'm taking damage i i don't know
what's happening
i am enemies are constantly spawning
literally on top of me
maybe they spawn on top of the flies i
don't know
have a feeling that that this runs
probably toasted
that that must be upper plop yeah i
think you're right i think
i think that's up stop shooting stop
shooting yeah yeah stop shooting
what the get out of here
oh yeah this is doing numbers
oh dude tur cha-ching
whatever the heck that is all right um
let's see was it space bar that was
causing it
is it oh you know what it is
is it number two spawning
enemies
like i'm pooping bombs but instead of
bombs he's pooping out enemies
oh that's horrible man so i can just tap
shoot for the rest of the run i guess
but
oh man it's still pretty bad i'm gonna
be honest dude i'm out of here
see you never i know we haven't been to
the item room on this floor but i don't
trust our odds to win here
i did um i did see that rainbow six
siege is adding pickle rick
and that's actually okay come on man
all right this we're dead that's
actually what i tweeted
uh like i quote tweeted rainbow six's uh
twitter account
just keep moving and then they deleted
the tweet but i think they just had a
typo because they put up another one
like later
but yeah pickle rick is gonna be a smoke
skin in rainbow six siege
and uh there's another rick and morty
i mean what are you supposed to do
there's another rick and morty meme
character that i think is gonna be like
a mute skin
damage plus tears that seems pretty good
succubus rotten dogs tooth
i think i crashed the game oh it just no
just made it go very slow for a second
i did see um so like the way that corey
beat this challenge
he literally just uh press the space bar
and it spawned the trophy anyone
so i'm i'm hoping that maybe given
enough of a sample size
we can be so blessed as well
um it's just an eternal or just appeared
out of nowhere
all right trolls tears i mean
i don't know the other item i i can't
actually tell if it was any good at all
oh
no no dude what the heck is this
apple of sodom
the heck is going on here man i don't
know
okay
seller two
what maybe this is incredible
i have no um i have no space bar item
anymore
but i do have squeezy tears up
that's it's a tears upgrade hey man
that's not
like for nothing no it's not a tears
upgrade
okay
so there's that
i don't know like i don't think the
whole run started over because we're on
cellar too right
but your items are gone are they though
or were they ever there in the first
place
i don't have an answer for that
it's trolley tears oh come on don't
don't be like oh i know exactly what
happened
i don't believe you it's like um
hold on there's a great joke in here
about a movie just give it a second
it's like the end of it follows nobody
knows it it's like the end of
um it's like the end of hereditary
nobody knows what happens
just keep it moving keep it moving
keep it moving what are the best
artificial
flavors um i've heard that vanilla
is the finest of the flavors and if you
see the show then you know the vertigo
has got to go because it's so dangerous
you'll have to sign a waiver
i just love wretch um
x72 uh you you receive
x72 i receive 14.
my that's my trade offer
oh no it's elon's son's birth
certificate

chalet swiss although i like the sushi
because it's never touched the frying
pan
let me out please okay
this run i mean i can't say positivity i
can't say negativity yet we just don't
know
sorry i was walking in the wrong
direction spark mouth got me wildin
he does say because that show has got
the boom anime babes that'll make me

it was like 9 40 or something it's not
that late but
i was like pretty tired
i'm telling you i said it in the last
run but like chibs uh
chib stream actually tired me out just
to watch which i think is like the mark
of great entertainment
i was also chatting which really takes
it out of you
yeah plus i streamed 23 hours yesterday
v-notched toxic breath oh
nice tears downgraded um no thank you
oh chess rivals was exhausting to watch
i hear that chatting well
it is hard work i thank you
hold on my headphones have been acting
up actually you'll be happy to note
um we were kind of uh i had some
headphone
shorts yesterday um i i have
purchased the replacement cable for the
sennheisers
that is arriving same day shipping baby
well next day shipping come on but still
yeah i think i drove over them too much
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna pretend that
that's not the case
can you explain crazy time
so like um the way i would explain crazy
time
it's a live casino game that has a
dealer that spins
a large wheel the wheel has a few
different things that it can land on
okay one of the there's a one
it can land on if it's like a roulette
wheel okay if it lands on one it pays
out
one times your bet so you get your bet
back plus one it's based on the
probability of it showing up
um if it rolls on a 2 you get you know
2x your bet
if it rolls onto a 5 and you bet on it
you get 5x your bet if it rolls onto a
10 you get 10x your bet
but then there are four potential bonus
spins one of them is literally from
vegas vacation it's called coin flip a
reroll stats by the way plus 10 luck
oh baby um coin flip
gives you a uh
i do love justin with sunglasses
um coin flip they have a red
side of a coin and a blue side each one
gets a different multiple
multiple of your bet from 2x up to a
maximum i think of 100x
uh there is pachinko where you could
possibly
get up to 300x your bet
there's um coin hunt
where you can shoot a symbol on a large
board and then it will reveal the
multiplier that you will
receive on your bet and then
i will not spoil for you what happens
but the rarest spot on the board is
called
crazy time and
i i have been lucky enough to witness
two crazy times in my life but i would
would not do you the disservice of
telling you what happens in crazy time
i think it's simply better if you
experience it for yourself
but i promise you that your imagination
cannot do
the reality of it justice
i gotta say uh
brimstone bombs pretty swell
brimstone bombs that only spawn
after you've killed every enemy on a
room seems kind of useless
oh yeah and like the whole time that
this is going on
there's uh the most degenerate chat
you'll ever see in your entire life
uh just like cyber bullying the hosts by
the way glyph of ball
is what we received glyph of ball i
would really like to take the one heart
item
you know like know it do
the keeper saw
no come on sure why not why not
why not
does the casino profit um well i'm sure
they take
uh
i mean it's like a roulette wheel right
like there's
basically the the amount of money
they're paying out per spin is
statistically lower than the amount of
money that they're paying out per spin
it's actually in comparison to some
other more traditional casino games
it's actually harder to tell because
like it's what the heck
it's like more obfuscated which is why i
think people
like honestly it does like a better job
um
from the casino standpoint at least
of of confusing uh the player base which
i think is what they're looking for
yeah this this item seems to change my
face and then occasionally also
create rocket bombs i suppose
okay every once in a while it turns
all the enemies into rocket bombs which
seems pretty good
also i have a beyblade orbital
now i do not have a beyblade orbital
you ever see that episode of dragon's
den where those two dudes poured in
their life savings to invent a brand new
casino game
i have not um that sounds like my unique
brand of sad humor though i will
i'm not gonna be like that's sad you
know like
i suppose i should have just left uh
yeah i've seen bullet ball many a time
in my life uh
no question about that i mean i just
like i i feel like
you got to recognize that all casino
games are inherently
unfun the only reason they might become
fun is because of the
variable reward that you get from
gambling on it right
like if i just said like hey do you guys
want to like come over and we'll just
like
play roulette for nothing you'd probably
be like
that sounds boring as heck
okay texas hold him fair enough but if i
was like hey you guys want to come over
and like play
blackjack i think you'd i don't know i
did it you know i played some blackjack
with my grandma when i was like
you know 11 or something but
kind of without having some real money
on the line it doesn't seem to be
all that exciting um
but then if you're like oh geez man



like we've made no progress in isaac
today but we have made progress
towards giving people entertainment
and that's the most important thing
we're doing one more team out run this
is beard bombs
e now i don't re-eyes
really makes you think e now i don't
re-eyes
i'm gonna go ahead and say it that's
that's a blessed item name
actually one of the best item names
we've ever seen although come on t-melt
is hard to
hard to compete with what is this
challenge in this challenge
nothing is as it seems
uh i got hit and i got spirit hearts can
we do that again
yes what's happening
every time i get hit it uses guppy's paw
oh my god
i thought it was awesome but it's
actually
yeah is actually not pretty or is it
hit me come on i want you to hit me
yeah we lose our containers but still
you know there's something in there
there's something to that that's a lot
of hp
plus we got health ups in the pill
rotation
what music is this this is uh from
synvictor's band
dude you're absolutely right what if we
got converter on hit
infinite hp i actually don't remember
how we unlocked this challenge
but i'm sure it had something to do with
like uh maybe winning a run as
alt path eden or something like that or
unlock tainted eden okay so if you
unlock tainted eden you get the
challenge
you know bear taffy are you here before
i talk smack i want to make sure you're
uh
you're here or not here i will change my
my cadence accordingly the bear taffy
you
you can tell that repentance has brought
back some people that haven't played
isaac in a long time uh that's ipac
also known as ojnan
because bear was like in the discord he
was like you
i hate the haunt he's the worst boss in
the game and i was like you sweet summer
child
we we got an eternal heart we got hp
when we went down to the next floor
this this this this that this halloween
okay good good room very good room
he got you got the eternal heart in the
second secret room oh
so i did so i did you know on a run like
this though
you can't trust anything we do appear to
have lost guppy's paw somehow
i don't know how maybe we had missing
though somewhere
maybe we may we turned the whole run
upside down excuse me that's a double
tinted rock
which led us to get mayo wisconsin
and then don't even get me started on
this this is pepto poop
3e6y follower thanks to everybody for
following the stream i really appreciate
it
we will oh that doesn't seem so bad
we'll use it on this boss
we have poisoned all enemies and i think
shot an icicle through his
through his body
[Laughter]
i don't know what happened there
we're also dude we're creating creep
that seems pretty good
the creep doesn't do damage but it slows
and does it ever
lag creep packet loss
tell me you're from wisconsin without
telling me you're from wisconsin
i'm trying to do the john madden voice
to say brett favre but i can't say a b
how do you say a b in the john madden
voice baby ram
baby random boot 12 room charge maybe
random boo
we shouldn't have even come in here
because we want deals with the angel
brought far brought far
far
that's not i hate to say it i'm just
every time we pick up an item we do so
or consumable we do that which is nice
i'm i'm not doing the voice right
well like i can't do it man i don't have
the energy okay
i mean i don't have like the vibe you
already know the vibe but i don't
i don't want okay it's brimstone fine
i'll take it glow and splash
what the heck is this whatever man in
for a penny in for a pound let's do the
mw
project as well why don't you go ahead
and give me something too yeah just blow
him up dude
i guess sure fine what the heck
just happened the chest turned into a
bone
i have no clue what's going on
it's always farts dude i gotta be honest
though
this guy chewing on stuff
doesn't seem that bad
not sure it seems that good but oh yeah
i can fly too
thank you saved
it's my new thing is taking damage and
then saying saved
sure why not what could go wrong faster
explosions
invincibility okay so we probably got
empty vessels somewhere in here
that's not a bad thing
that's captain hook pb
challenge it's just farts
as far as the eye can see i might as
well stick with this 12 room item
i don't know what it does but
i'm sticking with it nonetheless
pb challenge we have the occasional
piercing tier there there is that
very helpful thank you
invincibility is nice too maybe can i
just like leave myself here and push you
guys into the fires no because i've
extinguished them like a fool
i think that's a great way to describe
it yeah this challenge is like if you
gave
josh the power to uh name all the items
and then
the engine tried to infer what the item
does from the name
you should do a peanut butter taste test
you know what that would be an
interesting taste test
i've really only had jif
natural peanut butter from kraft and
unnatural peanut butter from kraft
anytime i see anybody buy peanut butter
sing page 2 evg
anytime i see anybody buy the the glass
jar peanut butter i think it's called
adams i uh
i'm just like oh geez i didn't know we
had like a millionaire
in the grocery store today or maybe like
a billionaire
adams is super good do you think it's
worth the like
the extra unit price that stuff is
awesome
adams is asked it's s here
i'm i'm a peanut butter guy like
straight up i
i could absolutely be persuaded
you know what there's only one way out
of this we got to do a blind taste test
i have no idea what is happening every
time i use this item
i mean i don't know if you could make a
and i i like peanut butter
i like kraft peanut butter but i don't
know if you could make a worse peanut
butter
like it really is just like
industrialized or
in industrial processed peanuts and like
partially hydrogenated
fats or something i just said you know
it's it's
it just tastes good nonetheless because
of the ingredients that are involved
but i'd be willing to try a little atoms
i guess
i'll give it a shot
i like that we got two of these guys
every every time we use
this do we get another one of these
permanently because like if that's the
case this run
is a win actually a win
what about almond butter i if i've said
it once i've said it uh
once or twice i have never had almond
butter
it's the same reason i haven't bought
non-craft peanut butter i'm because
almond butter tends to be much more
expensive
so i don't know if i want to expose
myself to that kind of
you know flavor and then feel compelled
to buy it again in the future
bro just chill that's friends
k's become what's what's happening here
what's what's wrong with this guy he's
okay he's back
um did you hear that sound
was that in the game all the items have
become bones
i didn't know this game was capable of
generating that noise
i actually yeah i thought either my
phone was ringing or like my computer
hard drive died
tinted rock please please please
so my new philosophy for this run
instead of containing the chaos
is just to pick up as many items as
possible and
so far i i have no idea whether or not
it's working but we do seem to still be
alive
and i mean on top of that we did just
get immorte trinken bro
yeah that noise scared me man i don't
like it i love that it's in here but i
don't like that they use it against me
tears up lockdown i can see forever i
thought that used to be a full health
pill
but that's okay not full health health
up did you see apollo's run of this
challenge
let me guess
he pressed the space bar and he received
uh the trophy
okay take me down basically that's what
happened
no that was corey i assumed it was the
same for both did you see my run of this
where we were beset on all sides by
laughing farting moms that created more
farting moms
we won anyway and then the trophy turned
into a rocket bomb
that rocketed through the boss door and
blew up so i couldn't actually beat the
challenge even though i completed it
people will never know the struggle 90s
only 90s kids know the struggle of the
rocket bomb run
that's always worth it for the clip
farming yes sir
gotta remember we got faster explosions
we we really do have holy mantle or
maybe we're the lost but we have hp
either one is actually very good
so i still have no idea what this does
it seems to just generate
a single grandfather fly
not really worth it once every 12 rooms
okay
i do this a little fool's gold over here
okay
he do be pardoned lol he farted
xlx spongebob
i need a new space bar item man what the
heck is a space bar item
oh that's e-more trinket row you haven't
gotten in your game yet
it's pretty good um it's a 12-room
charge and it
uh blows up a random object in the room
and creates one fly that does no damage
at all
i would probably put it in the a tier
personally
seems very very solid yo careful he's
mad
careful he's mad dude soul epiphora
it's a speed upgrade hey that's not
that's not nothing dude
whoa hey chill chill
what exact is your problem dude
kill it no because i think it'll also
damage enemies which would be pretty
sick
he's just going through a temporary heel
turn
i'm enjoying his damage output uh we
just shot a bone
like i don't know what's happening but
i'm for it
don't kill my other dude i'll be so
upset with you
oh come on
yeah just hey no just let him do don't
antagonize him okay just let him chill
out for a second
he'll he'll be fine just give him a
second to relax
what the
nasty pill gupp okay it's another 12
room charge
it did give us a ton of spirit hearts
we take everything now uh why would you
pick that oh my god we got hit and it
turned into a bone
mad pain
secret room don't be mad at me you you
you freaking nerd
trophy's gonna turn into a bone if you
get hit you know i
i actually 100 think that could happen
we got the shovel i mean
that's not a bad thing we're not gonna
use it to skip anything because we want
the items but maybe we'll skip like the
womb
we still like i don't know every time i
do this challenge i just have default
damage
i'm also endlessly creating like weight
what out of my body that seems pretty
good
anything that triggers on fart is like a
recipe for just endless
like farming
every time you kill an enemy we get
weight what out of our body i mean that
seems
it's almost the antithesis of the last
run where now i'm like dude
if if killing enemies gives us
wait what any any boss that spawns
enemies is gonna be insanely easy to
kill
okay i guess i shot the item and now the
item doesn't exist
hey cockatoo thanks for the
thanks for the gifted subscriptions much
appreciated thank you
isaac
go ahead do what you got to do like i
really
don't have a lot of damage so
like mom if you don't mind you could put
yourself in a position where this thing
could actually do some damage to you
i bopped him on his little head you see
that
i think there's like a 100 percent
chance the trophy's gonna turn into a
bomb
that's if we even make it that far
make sure you don't accidentally turn
the polaroid into a bone
uh g best boo
what the heck is this this seems good
that being said i'm going to replace it
with our other item because our other
items the shovels so we can steal
something from boss rush
unless we turn all our items on boss
rush into bones
you're of the sulfur tea bottle of pills
all right all right all right hold on
hold on oh we don't have a charge on it
get me out of here i'm not i'm not
willing to do it i'm not willing to do
it
this challenge is great it's also a
little tricky
i saw did anyone else see like a little
fist in there
it looked like i farted like a hand here
you see it
every time i fart there's like a little
knockout drops in there
it's like a little baby's hand
it's so good
don't chase me i'm trying my best here
you know what we out we out okay dude we
got it
but don't use it on this floor cause on
this floor we gotta go to
the cathedral not the shoal okay yeah
yeah
yeah yeah like a baby holding an apple
hey how'd that get up there who put that
package of hot dogs up there
the little hand is great i just it's
it's it's a little surreal but i'm i'm
for it
it i also love how it stands
well like it's not stands but like it
hovers for a second
before it uh it leaves
just to be like hello it's like he's
waving goodbye
and if you're in pain from laughing from
this run i'm not just putting like some
some sauce on it the uh
the run we had just before we went to
curse of the dead gods is one of the
funniest isaac runs
throughout and also like with the twist
ending like it was
it was actually a 10 out of 10.
combined with the fact that like i
needed an audio cue to draw
to dodge an enemy but the audio wasn't
working for me
due to my own fault to be clear not due
to the game
one makes you small
very valuable very valuable pl uh piece
of intelligence there
hello hands
oh there they all make it to youtube
more or less you know the only thing
that won't make it to youtube is like
the bloody mary challenge that i did
last friday over two different parts
because the whole overcooked
uh twitch rivals was in the middle of it
but if you're unaware we did defeat the
bloody mary challenge
it did happen
the magician better than the fool
probably
okay well i what i meant to say is that
the
fool is the best card in the game don't
know has anybody else had like
more uh
difficulty on this challenge than i have
like i feel like i've been highly cursed
we lost the run with t-melt which should
have been like a guarantee
kobold had a rough time with this one
too
i was gonna say i'm glad to hear that
but then i thought about how that came
across
but what i'm glad to hear is that i'm
not alone
i felt the same for bloody mary but then
i have to remember that i
cursed myself on bloody mary like
the runs were actually like we had an
instant win
guaranteed and i just kept rerolling it
for sport it was like the classic like
sewing versus reaping
i don't know just oh we don't even we
didn't even get the shovel that time
this is gonna take forever dude please
i have no bombs please spawn some weak
enemies near me
we do look at this look at this dude
okay we
just we got melee we don't really get to
trigger it but if we get close enough to
an enemy we get melee
we got shielded tears i can't take an
item in here man it's
we'll die we'll simply die
on the other hand fabula
it i mean it had to be done i never had
a choice
what the heck it's kind of good i wanted
some bombs but
do hush
the fool for hush that's not how that
works but i
i appreciate your ingenuity
if it did work like that that would be
pretty sick
okay please shout out
tinted rocks if you see them they're
heavy restart what the heck is happening
man
rage
we turned every consumable into chaos
cards
as a joke
[Laughter]
it's a heavily cursed floor what the
heck is this dude
i can't even get to it the map's broken
you can't get to oh that's i thought it
was an enemy but it's actually uh
it's just it's simply my item on display
every item farts man
you are entering the minkus realm
even with the busted like um map
i can still tell where the secret room
is man don't don't mess with me
let's go we're back
i don't you think i need to see the
floor to know where i'm going i don't
even need to see with my eyes to know
where i'm going dude
okay i'm just begging
that maybe they will give us
a damage upgrade from this boss
this one looks a little messed up i
don't know this looks normal man
if you if you play isaac in a 640 by 480
window this is just what the game looks
like
all the time so this is
pretty much like this is a home game for
me
also a home game having literally no
damage upgrades whatsoever
i guess i can't really complain we are
you know a minute and 43 seconds into
the run
but
oh sorry my wall hacks on can you guys
see that
uh slobber flying bobby friends of
course bobby friends we'll be heading
down to the next floor
sue bobby oh my god
oh kiss me every time man gets me every
time the rocket bombs gets you every
time
but it's actually like pretty good now
that i know it exists
is pretty good
now we just get it it's very simple you
get a deal with the devil you take it
it also has the peeler effect on it oh
no
you're right um
that's a little spicier no doubt about
that
okay i mean we need to keep our deal
with the devil chance alive so
no no throws please as they say on
twitch no throw arenos
almost through
you do be spawning a little faster i
think
look at that look at that look at that
look at we got him okay now just chill
just spiders man nothing nothing to
concern yourself with
easy get rainbow six siege we all float
down
am i insane this item seems awesome
we're generating a bunch of spiders
i'm gonna go insane uh no we can't do
that
that's the new team out baby
new team out baby unfortunately we got
to finish the run in like five minutes
so as not to make my wife late for her
stream
i think it is impossible however i think
we can we can put a real dent in it
because this item actually seems to be
incredible three
iit that seems like it does nothing
i also feel like there's a high
prevalence in
uh this challenge of items that do
literally nothing
earth's immunity now we're talking also
known as guardian angel
no ursus anymore we're done on ursus i
mean an
orbital is a great damage dealer too
dude that's like
it's highly positive i think we're
entering into a pretty good equilibrium
here where
every room we're generating spiders and
then we're not using the spiders we
generate so they'll melt a boss super
quick
like this will be really fast
please in chat do not call me a career
gamer it's one of the most insulting
phrases i've ever heard
what did i ever do to you to deserve
that kind of treatment
this isn't a career i would call it more
of a professional hobby
a red flag hobby if you will i can't
believe we got all this and we also have
a damage upgrade like
what have we done to deserve this
how's your toe it's getting better okay
that's
it it's not um it's it's no longer
something i concern myself with
it reminds me of when i was watching
chip play uh
hold on damage up that's exactly what we
needed
and then we of course we'll take both
all this absolutely
make sure you pop this real quick just
see what it does
um when i was watching chib uh play uh
crazy time
there was a lady spinning the wheel and
she made a bad spin and somebody in chat
named jerry said
you know you make me really sad like
just is that your job spinning a wheel
is that all you can do with your
s word life i was just like man
jerry come on dude that's like it's a
little rough man just because you ran
into a bad beat you don't have to put
like veronica on blasts like that
oh when andy was spinning oh don't even
i've andy i hope he's doing all right i
hope he's well compensated
proptosis short r that genuinely seemed
like it could be proptosis though
hello hello
she did not enjoy bananas
new baby food just dropped babies been
real loud since this new baby food just
dropped
that's crazy though because i i'm a
banana fan you like bananas too
whose baby is this she likes bok choy
she doesn't like bananas
kate i might be
eight minutes late
how does that strike you that's like
three games
i know you've been playing a lot of the
apple games
i have not played any apple
i believe the apple game is a game where
you try to
make numbers some to 10. yeah
not as easy as you think i believe that
but we have been working on this
challenge like all day with the
exception of that curse of the dead gods
section have you seen this challenge
casing point um d-a-e final fantasy 14
is actually seven years old um
okay so like every item is cursed you
don't know what it does
this is a non-government affiliated
friend
uh it's a 0.96 damage upgrade
yeah wait k you play league of legends
they got me how do you say it don't care
didn't ask plus you play league of
legends
i'm casting oh
so true yeah huh so true
[Laughter]
it's pretty good right like i i feel
dismissed when you say it
this is tim trainers is it's uh you fart
and then you get a luck upgrade
nothing wrong with that
oh baby she's wearing a cool jacket
again
[Laughter]
the spring the spring shedding
what are you gonna do on your stream
you're gonna play league of legends
dude i've been dreaming about how to be
a better ganker
better ganker you don't understand i was
watching
videos i was dreaming about it
it's like that's all i can think of
right now
you're gonna play as miss fortune she's
not a gamer
uh she can gank she has high burst
damage potential
she definitely might be one of the
champions that actually cannot
she's got mobility
you can just take a take a mobility rune
if you take us uh a slardar rune you can
charge with your cue
she doesn't know chad she doesn't know
oh
so true
[Laughter]
okay i mean what floor are we on here
necropolis one
we're making great time that's what i'll
say about where we're at right now
oh oh hello baby
plus we're about to get a deal with the
devil right here so it'll probably speed
it up or maybe slow it down or maybe
just like completely ruin it
this is humbling buns with a random
series of text in front
oh no did it did it take my did it take
my item
it didn't take my item right no it
didn't take my item confirmed what the
heck is happening here
hey baby oh it was a passive
i was in the pool
thank you thank you oh we have money
equals power dude
do you think you like this game
kate literally i just got hair in that
room did you see that
it's like the worst time possible for
that joke
i had like like beautiful flowing locks
okay you can't use it like all the time
okay you can't use it
that often
is this the same run so i used to have a
run i can't remember if it's this one or
the last one
where um any time i killed an enemy i
farted
and when i farted there was a little
hand that popped out of my butt
and it looked like it was given a thumbs
up
this is this game like it's it's gone
off the rails this is
less shot oh let's
so shot but i am retired
okay then take a nap and then fire the
missile oh
baby
maybe you're putting this in a weird
spot because technically uh
this mommy's like in or off time right
now but she's very generously letting me
get a little further into this run which
i appreciate
i will this i'm sorry this is at wod
no it took my good item okay it took my
ex placebo state took my good item i'm
screwed
um the way i always think about it is
that like i'm like elton john
like i have a beautiful voice i'm a
great performer um but i
i can't write songs to save my life
right so like
i need you to write the song for me
so that i can become elton john and then
you can be the
elden john's friend who wrote him all
those songs out of the goodness of his
heart
and then i get nothing i think you they
split their they split the royalties for
like a little bit
until albany well eldon was like at some
point i think he was like i don't need
you anymore and then
that's why he hasn't come out with any
new songs since 1971.
he says new songs are like you know
playing the piano
playing the piano playing the piano with
funny glasses on
rat jam rat jim thank you for the rat
jams appreciate it
um what have i done
i've created a shop item on the ground
and now it's gone
baby she's like it's my walk time
what you know she doesn't have a choice
in the matter she's like
normally we'd be walking right now
baby maybe she just wants some ketchup
playing the piano playing the piano
playing the piano with funny glasses on
a man in the audience's play rocket man
i tell him to shut
up and everybody claps this is the elton
john
original song from the year 2009. um
so i gotta source my jokes now sort of
source
my life my wife
we're close here
source wikipedia source i stole it from
television a long time ago
oh then maybe that's why she was
maybe that's why she was unhappy
who played now i've got my own song
stuck in my head i
it's pretty cool how when i reroll
items they always turn into troll bombs
or the teeth i suppose
i'm sorry kate accidentally made this
run take longer than it should have
taken
but i do i appreciate that you're you're
giving me space uh space to breathe here
i'm probably gonna lose anyway in just a
moment
oh this guy's not so bad one you just
got to play 3 700 hours and then
you know i i think i used the space in
my brain that used to hold the day that
our anniversary is to hold his boss
patterns so
who oh take x
bob c
nice little speed upgrade though
what the heck is bob c dude
also what the heck is this item that
that replaced my previous
amazing item with trash
what age do you think the baby will be
able to orange justice better than me
hey why would you say that what the heck
is happening on this room dude
what the heck's going on with my run
dude
it's like the one time i want active
items
oh no
what are you going to do in your first
game of league cave who are you going to
play
you will be playing you have chosen
champion
usain bolt
his his q ability lets him run
the 100 meter dash in 9.43 seconds
his w is
eat mcdonald's before
the event his his e
is a passive every time he uh
uses his cue it gives him
one more gold medal and every gold medal
makes makes him slightly faster
and then his ultimate is to use a soccer
ball
but not very well
was the same boat was he a good soccer
player when he when he tried to play
soccer
i thought like in soccer speed is so
valuable like maybe he could be like
like you could just try to pass it to
him and he would outrun everybody and
maybe have a chance to score
he he couldn't he couldn't shoot at all
that's pretty bad
but if he ever got a handle on that man
[Applause]
uh the red room i wish i didn't come in
here
i would like to leave now okay okay
so you're saying there's a chance
remember we we go down to the next floor
we get four brand new items
i mean this guy is not even like a
challenge anymore like
all like all i can really say is i just
wish i had a space bar item that
literally did
anything like no no
no
[Laughter]
oh
save save save
what's your favorite rune in league of
legends cave
so true ah
so true double damage that's a good one
who said that so true
who said that it's so good all right
it's a good stream today i hope you had
a great time watching it we'll be back
to do some more team outruns



send it back
send it back but like literally just
being like
um i'm betting on nine uh and the
roulette wheel says
uh 22 oh man
w7 yv yo
though hey hold up here pointy rib is
something
how many game games are actually fun
without rewards
i mean i i disagree but i agree
as strange as that might sound if you'll
excuse me i'm gonna be weird for a
second and put on some put on some lip
balm my lips are very uh
they're very dry
like i do think that uh i mean obviously
there are games that are just
fun if that makes sense but i think
there are also games
that are part of their fun
is from a simulated sort of reward
system like
like a battle pass or something like
that where it it almost has
the same sort of mechanism but
without using real money as a casino
where people are like
you know instead of just playing the
game because there's inherent fun in the
game
they're like oh i have to drop it moisty
meyer six times so that i can get the
battle pass
to fill up all the way right so i do
think that there's almost like some
like with what you're saying i disagree
but i agree in like a different
sort of principle that makes sense
but not loot lake exactly
i don't even know what that said man
well i actually agree that like i feel
like most board games are not that fun
either
um at least most old board games
you know like like modern board games i
actually feel like are
really good but also
tend to be fairly complicated to learn
but like you know any board game that
was invented
it like between the year 1800 and
1950 is probably boring as heck and i
deliberately structured that to avoid
chess
but like monopoly is is like
it's horrible right you just roll and
move and then i've only
recently like come to terms with the
fact that like
i really i used to think i was great at
monopoly but i'm pretty sure it's just
because like when i played with my
parents as a kid
they just let me win every time like i i
statistically should not have won
as often as i did the only the only
thing that explains it is that my
parents just let me win because i was
like eight
and then you realize like that's your
job as a parent is to like
you know let your kid win monopoly it's
like hey man at least like let him
win like a game that has like some merit
to it right
like i had no problem like throwing a
game to let my kid win but can we at
least teach him something like you know
katan or something like that
katan's a good game dude i have three
spider mods
but i also can't see enemy hp all right
okay we skip we don't even go in lr
all right
you appear to be farting out different
spiders every time
all right i like that they were left and
right as well
i have no idea what i'm doing man
whatsoever
this challenge loves farting you're not
wrong you realize like how many
items are they're just completely based
around farting
that's just robo baby 2.0 man you can't
trick me
uh sorry i meant that 7m toot on co
what did i tell you it's all farts man
as as far as the eye can see it's just
farts
just farts all the way down
don't don't get me started because i can
already play the tape forward in my head
someone said
nl what if what do you think about
legal adults who complain about adulting
and then i can see where i'm going in my
head and then i can see where chat's
going after that
and i can see my responses to chat and i
can see chad's responses to my response
to chat
and then i can see the essay that
happens on the subreddit afterwards and
then
the echo essay that happens on the
subreddit afterwards and then
like it's it's just uh it's a whole ball
of wax you know what here's here's what
i'll say about that
more power to you you know best of luck
to you
positive vibes only
perhaps a little bit more sodium
chloride
next time
you really can see fart into the future
i've calculated the argument already in
my head and decided there is no point
live laugh love baby that's one of my
favorite
uh tick tocks there's uh a lady who
goes into i can feel it
coming in the air tonight
i have no idea what that was but
that was very spooky it's a lady that
goes into like um i don't know if it's
like
marshalls or something like that and she
just looks at all those
those plaques that they have in there
that are like
live laugh love and she says it in like
a funny voice
she'll and i mean it's a pretty simple
bit but
bless this mess would you look at that
it gives me every time
look would you look at this don't talk
to me until i've had my zinfandel
it's good stuff it's very it's very
funny
i don't know if i should stick with this
item but it do all be farts no question
there
rose all day what would you look at this
it's a clock
and at 9am it says coffee at noon it
says water and at 3 pm it says wine
would you look
at that isn't that special
i'm taking back 7m the bean tudonko
it's bad for my range but hey man you
can't argue with the plus .07 tiers
upgrade
and the fart of course
oh all right thank you um excuse me
where's my deal with the angel uh it's
mysterious multi-dimensional eden's
blessing
our faith grows why yeah yeah my
thoughts exactly man
all right is sulphur so that seems
actually awesome
our fart grows this one could make it
man
this one could make it
can of corn
always like when when kate and i had you
know moved to this place
we went to a canadian chain store called
home sense
i know i have insulted home sense before
and somebody in chat was like you don't
even know what you're talking about home
sense is sick
so i apologize if that person is here i
don't mean to keep
making home sense like um the butt of
all my jokes
it's kind of like a i don't know like a
bed bath and beyond type
store but for home furnishings but like
it always makes me laugh it has like the
most
like generic like
world traveling sort of like stuff you
can buy like an eight dollar
globe made out of like paper mache or
something like that or like
they have so many like framed photos of
venice despite the fact that i've got to
imagine like if you went to venice you
would just take your own photo but like
if you would if you bought it you're
just like i don't know i just sort of
like the way it looks and i
i it like it's just kind of weird
in my mind to like display
of a generic photo in your home of like
a place that you've never been to
it's like airbnb sort of decor you know
what i mean
like when you go maybe you get like an
airbnb in boston or something like that
and there's all these photos of like
boston up in the airbnb
it's like a little it's just a little
strange to me it's like you got you
literally got like stock photos up in
your house
or you can get like uh you could buy
like a weird like spy glass or something
like that
i don't know it's just it's very strange
if your goal is to furnish your
airbnb it's the right place to go for
sure
i told you before but it's so remarkable
to me i'm gonna keep saying it
the worst piece of art i've ever seen
was in my parents airbnb when they came
to visit us
you know just after the baby was born
and it was just
a framed uh picture
and on the picture was a map of canada
laid over the map was a license plate
that just said sorry just like truly the
the most like meritless piece of of art
i've ever seen in my entire life
played off of a dated canadian
stereotype
i would not want to meet the maybe i do
want to meet the person
that buys that for a place that they
actually live in like if
if you are buying a piece of art for a
place that you're doing for short-term
rentals who cares
but like if you are like for my home i
need this
because i love license plates and also
canadians are apologetic like
i just just gotta know it does look like
it's made by an ai
like it you could you could put anything
behind it and you can put anything on
the license plate
like i also have no idea why there was a
license plate on it at all like
it's not like there was a picture of a
car in the background i guess the idea
yeah it's a map of canada you could
drive there
i don't know man it's uh cool
it's pretty bad don't mess with
canadians born in july
hell hath no fury like an angry
bartender
yukari sister maggie for real for real
that's just sack head man you can't
trick me blood bank lil
what is happening
he's still talking
he's still talking as curse of the tower
man
a sacred heart d up damage down
honestly sounds like a fair trade to me
he's still talking i don't think i went
to the
shop on this floor but i actually don't
care
i mean by shop i'm in the item room but
i still don't care
like just get me out of here as fast as
possible
this is a a harm reduction situation
please lucky penny baby yes sir
dude i i do we have like compost or
something like or
infestation two maybe
please no chess memes in this channel
we we try to keep this a drama free zone
saved
oh yeah
okay we're just chilling just chilling
personally i think the queen is open
make me say it
don't make me say it
sorry tears dude i'm telling you
we must be living in a simulation i just
referenced a piece of art that says
sorry they give me sorry tears
that's all i got i don't know that's
that's all i know about art
i'm not saying like it makes you a bad
person but i do
think it's kind of weird i mean this is
an interesting question for chad
oh hello i think thank you for the raid
daniel thank you
here's a question for dan's chat and
also my chat
is it weird to
display photos of locations in your home
that you've never been to
like if you've never traveled outside of
like your home state is it weird to have
like a photo of
paris or like a photo of venice or
something like that
photo of grease
like framed and displayed i'm like i
don't think it's weird to like have it
as your
like phone background or your computer
background or whatever
i do think it's a little strange to
display it in your home
but if i mean if you're
if your ancestry is from there you know
your parents are from there your
family's got roots there or something i
can sort of see it
i also like the other thing is you can
display whatever you want in your home
if it just like looks nice that's fine
i do find it like a little unusual
though
like i'm gonna maybe i'll go over and be
like oh have you ever been to corfu and
they'll be like nah i just think it's a
cool photo
i wouldn't be like i'm leaving i would
just be like
oh all right by the way er is watching
we could actually make this run work
yeah that that's a good way to describe
it maybe it's like very slightly weird
at worst
you have plans to check out returnal
this month i actually uh i actually do i
think
we'll see like there's a lot of variety
that i i still need to inject right now
it's like every day is
like a lot of isaac don't get me wrong
sorry i have a little spark mouth burp
there we go um
so i'm trying to do like juicy saw i'm
trying to do isaac like plus
something every every day maybe we'll
get to the part of the
of our lives where it's isaac plus
something plus something every day
excuse me uh i think i think returnal is
a is
something fun to try out i i
every time i get hit it spawns wall
masters dude get me out of here
never get hit again
every time i don't get hit it spawns
wall masters
and explosive diarrhea i have no idea
what's happening
i'm walking over gaps i can fly
sorry i'm not home right now walking
over gaps in isaac
okay okay so here's here's what i think
is happening okay
we have placebo which means we have to
dump explosive diarrhea
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the room is
done i think
it's hard to tell sometimes
okay i'll just be hit if you don't mind
man
come on
it's the mic no
no no no no no
come on man let me go let me
go there's too much dude
i'm not going back no i'm never going
back
oh look at that though that's good stuff
but when you finish the room
you get wall masters let me out
i'm dead there's no chance i there's
there's no chance dude it's not possible
okay saved save to like such an absurd
degree
nancy bombs
good stuff okay look at these
consumables stop watch let's our faith
our faith grows is pretty good man our
faith grows is a very very solid pickup
just don't get hit by this please tell
me we somehow picked up pyromaniac at
some point
like what are you supposed to do then
what are you supposed to do
i know i don't think this is what makes
the wall masters
i think i think it was a passive that we
picked up from that library
what do you mean
every fart explosion makes them okay
so you gotta keep killing enemies until
they don't fart
forget the hermit card
we got we're trying to test the theory
but right now it's it's working out
stop farting
i thought i told you to stop farting
okay we need like
oh my god
[Laughter]
dude it sounds like i'm in twitch chat
right now no farting please
saved sure yeah yeah
i don't know i don't know what you did
man i'm
i'm a broken man i'm a broken man
now that's good stuff every time we pick
up a consumable
we generate like a crazy amount of
spiders that's
that's very positive
i i do feel like chib waiting for crazy
time
he will never get crazy time
all right okay give me some sulphuric
somehow 12 billion farts but no wall
masters
it's only it's only enemy farts okay
loving the spider mob by the way loving
the spider mods really appreciate them
oh here we go here we go
here we go yet again here we go
i don't know there's there's probably
about a thousand of these oh my god what
what i don't think we should do boss
rush um oh four by the way
that's not even what boss rush is
supposed to look like right am i crazy
or is this
okay so i will i'm not gonna do boss
rush oh we could do
awas on boss rush but every time we do
this
aren't we creating spiders or am i we're
definitely creating spiders every time
we do this
um of these items
you got burgergl
7.2 volt
security key for a hotel cool and then
shadow i mean
out of all these i gotta try this right
friend full hp plus temp
alexander hamilton okay that's cool
luna the moon's bleep i told you we're
living in a simulation man
oh well there goes sulphur
down to the next floor
yeah naturally this is utero one just
just like i remember it
[Laughter]
what's happening on this run yeah nobody
like really knows
um and it's impossible to know i think
just free me from this this prison dude
uh there's a few things i i i know about
what's happening here
um one of them is anytime you see a
green fart cloud
it spawns a wall master which spawns
spiders which are
very likely to spawn to spawn green fart
clouds
um
wow that's embarrassing uh also my space
bar item is not
charging oh cause i haven't completed a
room yet
fair enough
just open the door for me no farts
saved saved
i'm not even sweating that man i don't
even care
it created an item pup you feel pro
air strike it created another item
stock knee what happened to my
item though what happened to my
what happened to luna the moon's bleed
it's gone for good i mean we did get
three items all of my stats appear to be
default but you know i suppose you can't
always get what you want
all right
somewhere in that mix there's butter
it's like butter
we did have eight spider moths though
open the door at least
dude this default damage is saved
is so bad
ah just got to get red key can
can a key and i'll be all right we can
fly
oh no he's stupid um
the spiders are are saving this run
we are in a little bit of a death spiral
i won't deny that the death spiral is
taking place
no farts
i got knuckle tattoos they say no farts
room full of red hearts room full of red
hearts and i'll be okay
no wall master
look to la muna
love the spiders man we love to see all
these spiders
we also love to see we're one hit away
from death we're toasted we're gonna
lose again
we're gonna live forever don't come on
we're actually this is like the furthest
i've ever made it on this challenge
more spiders always nice red hard maybe
just the single red heart would go a
long way if you die on this room you
deserve to die
never mind i've decided i'm popping the
cherry because i got scared by the
muhaha
i can fly if that had killed me i would
have the disappointment would have known
no bounds
please please lovers the fool on the
hill
half a red heart is something
sick
there's a nice little damage upgrade
by the way
psych oh no dude i hope it was i hope it
was sick and not psych
that was very close no farts no farts
speed down no thank you oh you know what
okay we we can i mean i know we can drop
and then pick up but that takes so much
time
instead like when we get the opportunity
to do a swap
that's what i'm talking about so you
just stand here and you do this
and you do that and you do this and you
do that
and every time we do this we're
generating spiders
we're living
we get an item from the boss you never
know you get an angel item
we're back on our feet
i don't have the patience to do it much
longer than that but that was still
pretty good
this seems like infinite wall masters
are about to
come down
no no
yeah i think we hit a spider cap or
something
i gained hp out of something you're not
wrong
i know i picked up a little but i think
we got some kind of healing as well
tiny
um
your enemy
so i think i think what's happening is
we have like butter
and then every time we use our space bar
item it's disappearing
and then reappearing as something else
we gotta you know with a 12 room charge
we gotta try it on the next room
like
i don't know what what's gonna happen
here but if it if it's just like the
poop i'm gonna be very upset
i'll be very upset indeed the womb too
okay
uh uh uh infinite farming um
fusp of sin reusable item uh that's
where you're wrong
if you don't mind i will be using the
sun card for full hp
as necessary we do have fire mine now
it's got to be done don't don't risk it
oh my god the gamma dude
the gamma oh come on
at least we know where we're going

one of the classic
yeah dance chat if you weren't here we
got an all-time classic item called
blood of the marty
what did it do nobody knows and that's
why it's so intriguing
i know i could just leave but at this
point like
i gotta get revenge
i left anyway
i thought i would i thought maybe they'd
drop a consumable for me
okay okay dude that's a lot of spiders
that's a lot of spiders okay hold on
headphones are getting a little a little
messy again
that that next day shipping can't happen
soon enough
say we didn't get hit
we got hit dude the headphone is like
it's it's spotty so i i can't tell
i i can't hear muhaha's so i don't
actually know when it ends
i don't know when it ends
i need to finish the i need to finish
the room
no no i'm dying i'm
pop the death card pop the death card
pop of death now i'm sweating we're
still not safe the doors are not open
i i i saw some green uh
clouds which means it's still not over i
think yep
and there's still a spider i saw another
green cloud is still not over
no green clouds please
there's it's still not open maybe
there's just a simple spider
living somewhere
there's a cup no greens no greens
the doors have opened the doors have
opened
i can now oh
headphones fixed oh my god okay 14 bombs
i mean i don't think it's a secret room
based on the red door but we gotta try
you know maybe we have the tick as a
trinket we were generating this has got
to be our secret room dude
because it doesn't have the red door on
it okay here we go this is the ticket
what's our luck one
i can't even figure out how to walk into
the door
i had to walk into the slot machine
okay oh but we got we got infinite swaps
at least for you know we can we can get
to the spider cap at least
spirit heart um
i can't see spirit hard
yes sir death
card world card world card will pop one
world card
will hold the death card potentially for
the boss
how's the weather in vancouver today
it's it's gorgeous
maybe a little bit um still a little
windy but again i'm not complaining
okay that's the trinket for us now
hermit card yes sir
um
yeah like the this level of sun
and like visibility lately has been
amazing
it's gorgeous weather it's just just a
touch windy on occasion the shot speed
down oh it's your speed down okay
and then um i'm just gonna take the
the death card into the mom's foot fight
and hope for the best
please please please i can't see my
hitbox
you know what's coming
[Laughter]
the ride has just begun
saved saved saved okay
now simply two more floors are required
we will take our world card with us
weird foot look okay maybe i called it
mom's foot maybe i don't know what's
happening right now
i'm doing my best though it has been a
journey i will
indeed fight a miniature boss
you know what buddy freak you
saved look upside down purple tee
infestation flyery god tears
cat propulsion plus five bow on cussive
delicious r it's char
i mean i wanna open it
these headphones man the cord cannot
arrive
soon enough
it wouldn't be a problem if it were not
for um
the fact that i can't hear the muhahas
they're coming through on the wrong
channel
we're not free don't get tricked we're
not free
you gotta wait until you see the doors
open up man
watch that left door like a hawk okay
thank you
still can't hear the muhahas no green
farts
no green farts saved
alges hagalas or
options what is this a minecraft joke
i can fly
okay that seemed great
that seems fantastic might as well
gulp
empress justice might as well pop it
okay we're back
we're back in we're back in it baby
okay we got red hearts there you know
what that means that means we're
actually gonna go back we're gonna open
up this
uh mimic back here naturally it created
a blue fire
i know exactly what's up with that
makes perfect sense we will be taking
our hagala's rune for now and moving on
you you just operate on the assumption
that there's muhaha's okay
saved you go back and get the empress
card
okay now it's a very long trip until we
get to the
the boss fight i
muhaha's incoming you know what
what if we just leave dude what if we
just leave what if we use our bombs on a
room like that
we decide it's not worth it and we get
the heck out of town
there's some farting there's some
muhahas but there's also red hearts on
the ground so i wouldn't mind clearing
this room
saved
instant death card no mo many muhahas
okay
again we would whenever possible we'd
like to do the room
not saved yet keep it rolling yeah we're
not on the chest
i know your your eyes may deceive you
temporarily this is merely the cathedral
i see green fires every single time
we're losing a lot of spider
interactions okay i have been hit
so that all doors are open but i really
i'd like to keep this room open so i can
go back
no red hearts no no let's go let's go
okay
now we could we have a safe path to go
downwards
or upwards i should say to get to the um
to get to the red hearts should we need
them and we probably will
the sigil of baphomet
every time you kill an enemy you get
some invincibility actually seems
unbelievably strong in this situation
we can kill the wall master oh we're not
done yet
it doesn't matter we it's so much harder
to hit us now
this trinket is gonna like it's gonna
carry
and i'm i am also doing this it's not
with no sound
it's just with a very like creepy amount
of sound if that makes sense
i can't hear the muhahas but i can hear
like
don't you know like when your headphones
get a little bit
jacked up he's done it oh we got to do
this
this is going to spawn infinite uh wall
masters so
just settle in i have no idea oh nothing
hit me that's fine
yeah this is an unskippable room
that secret room sound came through
clear as a bell
no trust me i got the i i understand you
gotta you gotta
wiggle the cord a little bit it is uh
it's a it's a constant
struggle right now like if i find the
exact perfect spot
like it works but i don't i don't know
if we can do this man like i i don't
know if there's a way out of this for us
i feel like we're simply adding to the
amount of
wall masters that exist
we're also invincible which is awesome
but
is it am i crazy is it settling down
just a little bit at least
game will probably crash
we could always like leave and re-enter
but
dude i moved into some i just moved my
leg
and all of a sudden i can actually uh i
can hear again
i can hear the muhahas we're generating
like
like two a second
like i mean i know i can go into the
secret room but like when i leave i'm
just gonna be back here
dude lower lower percentage of muhahas
we actually lost invincibility which is
a wonderful sign
come on come on
come on ladies and gentlemen
[Laughter]
he's actually done it we've freed
ourselves from the room
okay okay
please god just like one emperor card
would save me so much trouble
we can go back for empress but like i
mean like
i mean i'll go back for it but like i
just
how how much impact do you think is
going to have on
this run to get like a small
stat increase for one room like
i'll go back for it but but the penance
is that i want you to tell me
what you feel like the the likely
outcome of getting it is
are we gonna pick up the chest items oh
absolutely
at some point i wouldn't mind having
more than 5.19 damage
i do like we're shooting the the blue
tears that's pretty good
we're shooting the blue fires i should
say okay
take me back here
i know you can use it to create infinite
spiders that's that's actually more
valuable
yeah you're probably right like every
room when we finish it we could just
drop pick up drop pick up drop pick up
if we have to
that's a good point it'll take a long
time but
uh it still could have some value
purple ice cube f the occults in a box
what that's just a theme dude
actually it's edges a nice little damage
upgrade
sacred heart own nugget fry
and pyromaniac it
well i guess we will not be using own
nugget fry
or anything else for that matter um
it was pretty cool for a split second
though you got to
admit it was pretty cool
[Laughter]
oh would it would have been nice to know
what that one did in advance
but it's okay saved okay one room down
dude the invincibility is really good
any enemy that spawns weak other enemies
is is the the worst enemy
that's how we get in that's how we get
in these endless
like spawn chains
okay now that i hate that that's very
scary
our hp is so high though
don't hit me with troll bombs dude they
only make me stronger right now
okay it's like all consumables are being
turned into
rocket bombs
which is actually like bad
but it does mean that maybe i could drop
the empress card
on the boss and shoot a rocket bomb
at the boss
maybe
also screws up our spider generation
quite prodigiously
it's a good idea we should try dropping
a bomb
okay that's a little little surprising
it
happens to simply be a bomb
thank you invincibility i really
appreciate it um
oh well nevertheless
yes okay so all consumables are now
rocket bombs that is a good room to test
at least
yeah i'm hoping that like the trophy
doesn't turn into a rocket bomb
so the whatever we picked up that
creates those rocket bombs
is actually screwed the whole run we can
no longer generate spiders
which is quite unfortunate but you know
what we do still have like great
uh damage like
i we got uh
the the blue fires they're doing great
work save
saved
yeah no heels either so like every bit
of damage we take
is permanent on the other hand we also
get like a ton of invincibility
more more more
you can't bomb your way through the
chest so we're unfortunately we're kind
of stuck in the
well we can use the secret room as a
shortcut but apart from that we're kind
of we're kind of stuck on this one
that was good that was good saved
thank you so much it's just the secret
room and it turns
into like
creates rocket bombs the rocket bombs
blow up the
the greed head the greed head creates
spiders the spiders create wall masters
i refuse i refuse to play your game
okay try not to stand in the middle of a
room
when it ends because you will you will
have to i mean you'll be invincible if
you just killed an enemy but you do also
have to run the risk of that rocket bomb
causing you some problems
we gotta be getting close man no muha
are you okay mom you've barely touched
your muhaha
i'm just hoping if this you know what at
this point
it might actually just be funnier if the
trophy turns into a rocket bomb
and explodes in my face and kills me
like that would be the perfect
i can't ending we're still alive
no i think i'm i think i'm actually
gonna pop empress oh my god it's the
boss fight
i think i'm actually gonna pop empress
on the boss fight for the damage upgrade
because i'm like
i don't know i'm loco
at least it didn't moo haha
come on
you're witnessing a man on his on his
last legs of sanity
saved saved
i don't know man are you just gonna pay
out with a bunch of rocket bombs and
blow me up
do
i mean it's not like i didn't see it
coming like
here we go here here comes the cycle of
muhaha
can someone please explain this
challenge this challenge cannot be
explained
it's a color out of space
okay i would say step one is probably
take out blue baby
bro that was the trophy
um i don't know
i don't know what to do
i think i think i'll go stand in the
room
save and quit and then reload and see if
it works
and then we'll move on like i mean it is
what it is
it's it's honestly just humorous like
i'm not mad
i think it's i think it's hilarious
i just think it's funny that i'm i'm
happy we got more excuses to do this
challenge man like
this is a lot of fun why'd you enter
another room
i don't know i was stun locked
i was psychologically stunlocked by this
i wanted one last muhahaha
do you see how small that was save saved
okay
i mean i don't think it's gonna work but
we're gonna come in here we're gonna
exit
game we're gonna continue game
nah dude i think we gotta i think we got
to accept like who
can say where the wind blows
where the day goes only
time who can
say something
something something it was one of my
favorite
runs that we've ever done though for
sure um
slash marker moo ha ha ha ha
um



all right by popular demand perhaps the
most
commonly requested challenge is to redo
the t-melt challenge i'm gonna do my
best
we're starting on the seller one this is
not a seller that i have seen before in
my life oh cause all the rooms are
different
because of t-melt so on t-melt
everything is
randomized um
so you can't trust anything so we're
just gonna banter the whole time
at least until we have some momentum um
i gotta tell my whole i'm being honest
my whole night got screwed up
i spent way too much time watching
chibley play
crazy time in the online casino i don't
know of anybody else
like i mean i saw a lot of people there
if you
i i expected literally to watch chibley
for like 10 minutes
while you know my baby shift ended and
and kate's picked up
uh instead i watched like
like literally three and a half hours of
ghibli online gambling
it was it was one of the most bizarre
pieces of content i've ever str i've
ever seen in my entire life
but i had a great time i would highly
recommend if you ever see chibly
streaming crazy time or it would just be
called slots but
um if you ever see chibley streaming in
the slots category and you're awake i
highly recommend it
um it it i'm not joking it's screwed up
my whole night man
it was all i had to like pull myself
away from the uh
from the stream just to set my videos
and then like i don't know like just
watching him gamble
made me so tired like i i went to bed 45
minutes before i normally did
it's crazy i also like it really put
into perspective for me like i
i know come on come on man come on
i know on a logical level that like
gambling addiction is a real thing
i personally don't feel the pull
of gambling addiction that doesn't mean
that it doesn't exist
but it really hit it home for me last
night when i realized that like in this
crazy time
you know live dealer slot machine type
game
there were people that were literally
like i saw one guy win like sixty
thousand dollars
and in order to win sixty thousand
dollars he must have placed a bet that
was like
at least two or three thousand dollars
sup it's just a luck upgrade what the
heck
and i'm like dude if you have the kind
of disposable
income to to bet like four figures on
a spin of a wheel in like a virtual
casino
i'm like man like a
that addiction must be real because you
could you could buy like some
some cool stuff for for a thousand
dollars or
for for four thousand dollars
maybe it's not disposable but i i mean
like here's the thing like to be able to
i don't i don't know how it works maybe
you can get like margin or something
from the casino but like
to bet four thousand dollars like you
have to have four thousand dollars
oh the chad was crazy man
like whenever there was like a a woman
spinning the wheel
for a dollar name a woman um whenever
there's a woman spinning the wheel
like whenever things went right
by the way ojk whenever things went
right people were like you are very
beautiful
i love you when things went wrong there
was like some guy in the chat who was
like
i actually feel bad for you imagine your
whole life
being just spinning a wheel is that all
you're capable of doing with your life
and you're like yo that seemed pretty
good actually and you're like oh my god
it's actually like twitch chat raised to
like the
the infinite power
pp dollar sign no comment pp dollar sign
[Laughter]
yeah so we deleted yesterday's vod just
cause like
all the content from it was highlighted
already but the vod was bugged and it
said it was 23 hours long
um i don't know where that sharp key is
coming from please don't make me shoot
my sharp key for nothing
so we we deleted it but all the content
is there you just gotta click on five
different things now
also no music f
help help me
anyway i forgot what i was talking about
it
it was just insane to me man like seeing
and there was like
some people that you would see i wasn't
there for the mythical paul
when when paul was winning like five to
six figures almost every spin
in chip stream but like
i i did see one guy that like routinely
you would see him winning like like
multiple thousands of dollars on like
nothing spins
and you're like dude like are you okay
oh my god so every time
i restart my computer it resets my sound
uh so i always set it so that the system
sound is at zero and the the computer is
like that's a mistake right you wanted
it to be at maximum
my mistake on that prob probably got you
a little bit freaked out wondering where
that was coming from
so if you'll excuse me i'm gonna pull
system sounds back down to zero and we
should be good to go
all right there you go i'm not gonna use
this yet i think it's better on the boss
we got a good space bar item
but like you know there's two ways that
that could go right like
one way is that that person is just
unbelievably lucky
and then the other much more likely way
is that that person is placing such high
bets
that even though you know they're losing
on
average they're still getting a payout
um that appears to be
so high and then you just start to be
like oh my god like
who are these people that are like um
that are literally putting like like
four or five figure bets down
once a minute while just like chilling
in this weird like
i don't know what to call it like i
don't want to say it's just for losers
but i'm like
i mean it's it's like twitch streaming
but like just
simply designed to take your money it's
like a twitch stream that that shouts
out uh subscribers you know
oh i'm going there it's crazy man like
yeah no chip was just there ironically i
i don't lump him in there
it also like oh ziwa tears
plus faith it also really
put in the oh there's the d10 in there
somewhere it put into perspective for me
like
how unemotional the casino is
like anytime uh busted out
you expected that uh
it's they said it hurt but i don't think
it hurt any time ship busted out
you expected that it would be like you
know the casino would be like
but instead he's just like all right
this is my last bet i bet on five and
then one comes up
and they're just like all right next
spin and you're like oh my god
they just they instantly like clip the
the dopamine cable they don't go like oh
too bad they're just like uh please
input more money to feel good again
it's crazy man
yeah they don't they don't focus on the
bad stuff
i am talking about crazy time i am
talking about crazy crazy time anyway
yeah
um i don't
feel comfortable uh you know do it i
mean i don't like gambling to begin with
but uh and i don't feel comfortable uh
doing gambling on my stream but i will
watch chibley like every time he does it
it's not even to watch him win money or
lose money it's literally just like
the the vibes are off the charts
i don't know like the thing with like
that's not a flex i actually just feel
lucky
like i just don't find gambling like uh
fun like in principle just watching a
wheel spin around and hoping it lands on
you know your number
or something like that i don't derive
that much pleasure from that
but different strokes for different
folks yeah plus it's illegal in north
america anyway
freaking nanny state
what about sports gambling now and then
but it's like
less about um the bet and more about
just like making the sport fun to watch
like when i say now and then i don't
mean like once a month
i mean like i've literally placed like
four
sport wagers in my entire life and every
single one of them was when i was in
las vegas and two of them were on the
same game
come on man come on
that could be your new hobby dude you
know i talked about yesterday like
chips got me going off about these like
red flag hobbies i realized like there's
so many of them
and by the way i guess i'll be shooting
my keys now if you don't mind uh
sorry i didn't need to go to the item
room anyway um
but sports gambling is another one that
scares me now han solo if you're here
you might not be
i know like you're you're uh a sports
gambler i s you know you might be in
dance streams still
i you're you've never been a toxic
chatter
at all i think you're the exception of
the rule for sure
but like whenever i see someone on
twitter and they have like a a bad uh
take or like a truly offensive take
there are times where inside of their
twitter mentions like within the last
hour there
is something like i can't believe that
you know ben simmons didn't hit that we
would have covered the spread
like just asinine
and there's a apparently there's like um
there's like patreons where you can um
like pay money to get access to private
discords that have sports gambling
advice i had no idea
it really is it's kind of like i guess
the stock part of the internet in that
sense but we don't need to get into that
it's wild man yeah i'm always like
gambling is still kind of i think it's
changing
like in north america the the norms
towards gambling especially sports
gambling
are getting like a little bit more
permissive i think
definitely the stereotype when i was
younger is like you're a degenerate if
you have like a bookie or something like
that like
you know you're you probably are on your
way to having a problem
but it is also crazy like um
anytime ed ed plus range up let's go
we got the developer
but uh anytime i'm in europe i'm like
you know in in uk in well i mean this is
literally just the uk and iceland really
i don't remember seeing them in sweden
but in the uk and in iceland like so
many like betting parlors and stuff like
that
like i don't even know what it is like
it looks like a pc
like an internet cafe but then also like
i guess you just go in there like bet
and watch sports maybe like it's like a
little sports book or something like
that
sweden has horse racing in some
supermarkets i had no idea
weirder
okay we at least got into the item room
a box what
all right uh i'm inclined to believe
that that's horrible
that seems really bad
oh well they have those in the u.s
too i guess like it's it it really seems
like it's spreading
i mean for the most i mean they have the
lottery obviously in the us as well
like as long as you're you know aware of
what's happening
i you know maybe it's controversial but
i'm like
if you're an adult and you enjoy a
little gambling
by all means you know sure this should
be fun
as long as you're like uh you know
tears uh if you understand probability
to some extent
we have it in bc i mean that's true yeah
i think you can legally bet on
you can definitely legally bet on
esports in bc
it is crazy so i you know i i've been
listening to all these audio books about
like
you know behavioral economics and stuff
like that and and how like
human beings are really really bad at
judging probabilities
like they they all tend there's a
statistically significant tendency
to overestimate the likelihood of a low
probability event occurring
like something that has a five percent
chance like to most people's brains it
actually feels more like
you know like a 20 chance maybe um
but they had like an anecdote that
really struck me
that i was like i'd never thought about
it that way um
it was like you know the odds of winning
a high value single payout american
lottery like the powerball
and being the only winner um
is something like one in 175 million
which you know you're like that's a lot
that's crazy
but then they contextualized it and they
were like
that's like picking taking all of the
time
from the founding of the united states
in 1776
until 2020
and then picking the exact second
that was randomly chosen and i was like
okay one in 175 million
is like that seems plausible to it
unlikely
but plausible picking the exact second
that has passed over the past like you
know
244 years that that seems like such a
gargantuan task that i think now i
understand
pageantry though if you got it right
though
the pageantry and i mean somebody's
gotta win right
yeah we got botfly here
yeah isaac without music it's uh
it lacks a little pageantry as well
um anyway
yeah it just becomes big number you're
not wrong just take it man
i'll take even bad pills i'm i'm loco
here
and i was laughing when when like in the
online casino
magic mushroom oh well i guess we'll be
sticking with this item then
what the heck we gotta we got a cool
little gastly following us around
um it made me laugh like whenever there
was a bad spin
when chib was playing crazy time like
some people in the
in the crazy time chat would be like
forget this
this game's rigged dude this game's
rigged
and i'm like what are you talking about
man it comes pre-rigged
it's a casino they don't need to rig it
you already know it's rigged and you're
still choosing to play it
like they don't need to put any extra
sauce on it
what is this this bubbling man oh you
think
it's void yeah we might have void here
anyway just just interesting stuff to
think about uh
i i would prefer not to you know what
hold on hold on
dude oh i was going to go back and use a
key on the on the door
no you would think based on this that i
would be like a poker guy but
i'm really not a poker guy the problem
is i'm
i'm so like uh black circle
i'm so risk-averse that uh
like when i play poker i'm the most
predictable poker player of all time
because i just i fold unless i have
uh good cards
and like i i i mean i don't have a
strategy except like
take the longest time possible to lose
is basically my my strategy
you know it if i ever uh
check you know i got garbage which i
know is like then the next step is like
but then every once in a while you gotta
try to throw them off you gotta
you gotta bet when you've got some
garbage so they don't actually get
uh so they don't get wise to you but
like i just i've never developed
any kind of poker strategy
58 and 48 cents okay how about no
how about no shop
shop evil oh don't say that
it hurts daddy when you say that
nice sale prices bro yeah hey items in
the shop making the
making the coinbase ipo look like a
steal am i right
fellow gamers anyway i'm not involved in
all that stuff
oh tomo you want to come in buddy hold
on
hold on hold on hold on hold on i'm on
my headphone cord hold on
hold on hold on hold on
hey tomorrow hey bro guy
no music dude
i have to uh
i have to apologize by the way dude the
self farting
uh there is and i find it hilarious but
inevitably some people will be grossed
out
there was a um
a moment in today's isaac episode where
i paused
and then i said like sorry
i thought there was a knock on the door
but it turns out the baby was just
filling her diaper
why u9q7 super bandage
please don't cost me my eternal heart
i don't know i gotta be honest with you
this actually seems pretty good in spite
of the fact that i'm a little angry
[Laughter]
cause i think it's gonna cost us a
little hp
maybe but it actually seems like it
could be
like pretty advantageous on tough rooms
yes clip that clip that all right down
to the next floor
don't the diagonal walking don't debase
yourself
by being surprised
when i walk diagonally like it's just
act like you've been there
i get half a red heart you get
baby plum i'm telling you man that that
meme
is that memes going to the stratosphere
trade offer
it's already kind of on the stratosphere
but it
it's still i mean it's a good meme nice
wholesome
wholesome-esque meme
uh i have thrown my key at an enemy
i also have dad's ring where did that
come from
trade offer you get one follow to i get
one follow you get an infinite amount of
pogs
thank you toasty i appreciate it thank
you
it's the unfunniest meme i've ever seen
bro come on you sound like somebody
complaining that
a post labeled not safe for work is not
horny enough for you
like if you you sound like one of those
people complaining
that you got like oh you thought you
were gonna get like a horny post but
instead it's just like you know
vaguely lewd cosplay or something like
that
come on well there goes my only key
no big deal
how about this for a trade offer you get
200 i get the greatest
kitchen appliance of all time it's known
as an
air fryer le tier burst
i don't know what that is
so i was using my air fryer yesterday
and
that's a drive to deep left field by
castellanos
home run that makes it a four nothing
ball game
i don't know if i'll ever step foot in
this booth ever again
this is such a good meme dude
step into the booth shinji or
castellanos will have to hit the drive
to deep left field
that's a home run and it's a 4-0 ball
game
can i get a context for that what
happened here
um yeah so uh
the radio announcer said something
horrible
like extremely offensive uh without
knowing that his mic was
hot
and then he got uh i mean obviously he
got caught on the broadcast
so then he had to come back and announce
that like he wasn't gonna be back
but in the middle of his announcement
castellanos hit a drive to
deep left field uh so his apology is
interspersed
with him having to call the home run as
well
so it's like in the in the middle of the
man's
self-imposed like career destruction
he has to be like and
he has to give this really sad home run
call
it's it's really good
yeah i mean it's even if you don't like
sports it's a great clip
by the way i would like to acknowledge
that
behind the meme has some new context for
the angriest man in new york history
i had no idea you know this is the your
flat you got no talent
apparently somebody did an interview
with them and they then it was posted on
the subreddit
apparently this took place
outside of like the living history
museum for the holocaust
and i actually think that it adds
like a decent amount of context to why
he was so upset
you know probably still shouldn't be
verbally abusing
the trumpet player but simultaneously
certainly explains why he's not
like why partly he's so upset and he
feels like decorum has been
uh shattered i guess
i okay look i'm not defending everything
he said i'm just saying the context of
the meme
certainly changes the interpretation to
some extent
like when he said that uh oh i didn't go
to the island oh i did go to the item
when he says like um you know this is
one of the most
important pieces of architecture in
north america i literally thought he was
talking about like
rockefeller center or something like
that
now i'm like that line makes so much
more sense when you
realize that it you know he's actually
not wrong
yeah the interview was posted on the
subreddit so you
i don't know it's in a post there i
think i'm the only person that replied
to the post
because i'm the only person with the
cajones to acknowledge when i'm wrong
now does that mean he should be talking
about how he you know
walked bob dylan out on stage in 1965
maybe not but i can certainly understand
why
he's a little bit more emotional rx
become the
all right um
i gotta say like become the
it this certainly seems like kind of a
horrible run right now
i don't know if we've gotten like almost
anything useful but
i'm i'm hoping that'll change
get a little deep
yeah this is the eden challenge thoughts
arrive like butterflies
and it goes to blue baby it's not that
hard
hey i've got stick-to-itiveness you know
i even though the run is kind of like
stuck here at default damage nothing
spectacular happening i'm still like
i always feel like i got a chance i i
also have no idea what's happening here
please don't make me use another key to
open my item
oh thank god okay what the heck is this
game
yo actually like
this seems
um i hate to say it
i wonder if it's a permanent upgrade it
is a permanent damage upgrade when we
used it yeah this seems this seems
better
let's go okay let's see if it actually
did give us
a permanent damage upgrade
f i mean
like i gotta be honest i think it's
still pretty bad but
just by holding it we probably gained it
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
you gain gain i gain nothing
yeah it didn't mean i don't know it
still seems okay
i don't know if it's as good as baby
plum will be against bosses but
i mean it's something
tap the fire button with the baby no
like it doesn't reshoot the baby
oh i think that's unless i'm mistaken
we'll check it out on the next tough
room
um it doesn't
uh reshoot the baby it merely uh
makes a familiar
yeah we don't need that tinted skull i
wouldn't i wouldn't sweat that
it's not in the purview for this
challenge
all right that's fine i didn't need a
key anyway
come on man you know what we got bombs
i walked bob dylan out on stage in 1963
i don't need to deal with this room
yeah at least the fly is like kind of an
orbital
i don't know man like this this one
seems not long for this world
much like my keys are not long for this
world
why do you think that videos made such a
comeback for you it's an
interesting question um i think that as
i've gotten older i've actually
realized that early youtube as a
consumer
was like uh that was like the golden era
and i know that this sounds like
self-hating
it's not like as a creator is way better
now
like a billion times better however
like it was uh let me just see what this
lemonade picture is
it's m i should have known it creates a
bomb
i'm not sold on it uh but
the era where there was not like the
economy of creators competing for
attention and it was instead just like
look at all this funny stuff that
like if youtube didn't exist you would
never actually see
i think that was uh that was a good era
for for entertainment
like just funny skits and you know
public freakouts and stuff like that
as a video viewer i think that was that
was a golden age
i mean we're not going to be able to buy
anything on the shop anyway we might as
well
just send it come on man come on yeah
yeah yeah yeah
landed landed
there we go little little damage
appreciate it i guess we will pop this
and as a creator no as a creator is a
billion times better now maybe not as
good as it was in 2016
but still like you know
would you still play isaac if isaac were
not bald
i'd have to think about it because it
does compromise like my
my values but
excuse me please yes thank you yes i
just wanted you to crush that tinted
rock so i could get access to nothing
i'm gonna go ahead and predict this is
gonna be an awesome item
why jelly certainly made
like it sounds like an airplane's
landing um what do you think here
green tongue or ready player one
[Laughter]
i mean green tongue looks pretty cool
man
it's plus four ma k another luck upgrade
just what i needed
why does everything poop like that's
just i mean not in real life obviously
that
i i got a whole four-year degree
dedicated to learning that
um but like why
every item i have just creates farts
ma the meatloaf that's the other part of
old youtube funny clips from movies that
you had watched but forgotten things
about
her husband died in a hang gliding
accident what an idiot
oh i'm flying i'm flying i'm flying i'm
dead
step brothers sweet child of mine car
scene
10 hour please tears
it's mom's b
well i guess we will be using mom's b
[Laughter]
i have no idea what's happening at all
flat so flat
that kid was a great singer you got to
admit
i mean i think this is it's the kind of
room where you just gotta like
you just gotta stay steady you know what
i mean
you just gotta recognize just oh my keys
man
you just you just gotta not get tilted
you just gotta roll with the punches
shot speed down that's pretty good
shot speed down
this is isaac after you put it in the
microwave i hear that man
why you 9q7 super bandage i think it's a
much better item
it's funny that the mom from step
brothers has won an oscar
not from step brothers of course wait um
has she wanted us that's ted danson's
wife right like i'm
oh frick
all right um that happened fast slash
marker
t-melt attempt one



everybody wants to see
new t-melt okay we're gonna we're gonna
do one
normie-ish run before we try to do
t-melting
um just because i would actually like if
possible
uh to to get the slightest bit of
momentum
um and and we'll see so one one thing
i've been trying to do is like hey look
at this blue baby
blue baby does not have an alt path
victory blue baby does not have a true
ending victory
there's a seed in case you are
interested
and there's roon bag the the best item
i've ever seen
and now please give me the pogs to get
through this work day i'm happy to be
your second monitor marty i'm happy to
be
um you know blasting through the airpods
when you got your phone in your pocket
however you you like to consume the
content i'm i'm happy to be there
i regret coming into this room though i
do
come on don't don't say i'm on monitor
one like that's a lot of pressure quite
honestly
anybody else have like a poop bias in
this game
like the poop that is on the ground has
the same chance to pay out as the poop
that you drop
but the poop that you drop you drop it
which makes it oh come on that much more
valuable like in my head i'm like it's
worth more
check this out dude oh no
that's all right i'm not afraid to to
play risky at the start of the game
because you know like at the start of
the game there's a very low barrier to
entry if you die you die nobody cares
it's not like we got a
a you know seven digit streak or
whatever going on here
we're not sweating it yeah live fast die
young bad girls do it well
my chain hits my chest when i'm banging
on the stereo
great song i dude i don't know if we
were talking about like
mia's best song
so i forget the name of the first album
i i'm just going to be honest
as a suburban kid with a biblical name
uh first album went a little hard for me
you know it was a little bit
it was confrontational i didn't know how
to take it it was like listening to
dizzy rascal
it was a little bit um too much for me
but then
uh the second album kala
i believe it's called so many incredible
bops on it
it's it's a unbelievable paper planes of
course took off in a huge way
but then you know boys is a good song um
is there is there a song called jimmy on
that or am i losing my mind
that uses like an abba sample
delete ddd that's a great song man
i haven't listened to it since 2007 but
it's a great song
okay tears up you'll love to see it oh
it's me
um you know what that is hung up by
madonna but that's also
jimmy um i'm going to uh i'm going to do
alt path because i'm not scared
i'm not scared at all
it's not a tears up it's just tears the
size is higher
the size is larger hmm saved dude this
library could save the whole run
it feels like my tears are better and
honestly like that's a buff
to feel better about your run alges a
was
me maroon um to feel better about your
run
is a is a buff okay if we could just fly
and get that uh
book of revelations we're fine just fly
get book of revelations can of corn
i will pop out of safety i do see that
we are now
we we have some potentiality here
and now how are you feeling about
repentance overall right now
uh extremely positive
every day that i stream
repentance i feel
more positive about repentance
i think that it it my my fervor toward
it has grown over time
it just gets better hey farticus thanks
for the gifted subs thank you
everybody in the youtube comments was
laughing
derrick you cindy
uh about how i every time i read your
name i i can't stop myself from
chuckling
derek you get you derek you
might as well get book of virtues too
hey why don't you
uh get into my game as if this was the
ytv television show
reboot and then why don't you just give
me a key
you know if you gotta if you got a key
you're interested in in giving me i
would love to take it off your hands
we are not going to look at the deal
with the devil because
then we'll get a deal with the angel in
the future as a result
derrick you derek you
i'm sorry did i miss the sponsored air
fryer bit of the day
it's not sponsored um i just like to
recommend good products as opposed to
most people who like to recommend bad
anime
you know i i consider myself a bit of a
consumer advocate
and as a result i am above reproach and
criticism so how about you suit yourself
okay we have no key we could go to the
curse room
hmm okay so because we we are unable to
get
curse of or uh we're curse of the
lockless
like track one side one on the shins
album shoots too narrow
um we have to
go in here see what we get
i was gonna a was out but just when i
thought i was out
they sucked me back in so check this out
we're actually going to create the
opportunity for a planetarium
because we're going to get bookworm and
we're going to have book of virtues
and the book of revelation stick
together here
now we're talking you know what i could
bomb into the item room potentially
let's take a look
no we can't wait yes we no it's over
here okay maybe i placed it wrong i
don't think so we're going down to the
next floor
ascended strategy thank you chad oh baby
sip of the spark mouth
oh the superior sparkling water brand
anyway moving on i'm not actually mad
but the more i talk about it
the more my my face gets hot and i
i feel like a certain tension in my
solar plexus is that what anger is
i don't know maybe
[Laughter]
yo spark mouth is so good glad glad to
hear the fellow
patrician in chat you can buy it
at uh canadian grocery stores or london
drugs the pharmacy
or at well.ca if you're a canadian uh
consumer
it's delicious i can't recommend it
enough i will note buyer beware
it does come with a slightly more
premium price tag but that's the price
you pay sometimes to buy a local
i i had to make a choice man uh instead
of supporting the pepsi cola uh
multinational corporation
that's a really good get we got super
lucky there
spark mouth has the best lime i'm very
glad
uh to hear that because uh i have not uh
had the lime yet you know the other
thing i really like about spark mouth
they sell
uh variety packs instead of buying a 12
pack of the same flavor you can get a a
four flavored variety pack that has
three of each
all the limes i loaded them first so
they're sitting at the back of my fridge
i'm excited farticus thank you as well
thank you
plus it is a cool name yeah spark mouth
awas
you know the runes so nice they gave it
to us twice
planetarium please
i have indeed replaced the headphone
cord thank you for asking
i did i i had some time uh yesterday and
i
you know it took four seconds
i think i also like we're doing like the
the headphones of theseus here
because i actually think like the jack
is a little bit messed up
as well so i think i don't know i'm
gonna try to buy like a replacement jack
but then i also i'm like at that point i
don't know maybe i should have just
bought like a whole replacement headset
or something like that but i imagine
the the most expensive part of the
headset is the
the actual headset itself you know not
the uh
not the the little cables that are like
interchangeable and
you know you could buy them at radio
shack if it still existed for like 10
cents each
derek you derek you
get some sennheiser's that's a good idea
i might consider it
speed up angel deal prayer
card which is actually not very good but
at least we do get a free wisp
and then we should have saved a bomb but
i didn't say a bomb save a bomb
i got so freaked out hold on why are you
slow
why was he slow i don't understand
yeah i could just buy a bomb or
something oh that's a good idea we could
just do a bait
tweet for well i don't know i don't want
to replace these i actually like these a
lot
but uh
if i maybe could i place a bait tweet to
maybe get like
circuit city or aliexpress to send me a
new
3.5 millimeter jack hey anybody know
uh a good company that sells three and a
half millimeter uh
jacks for audio cables just asking
go ahead slide into the dms can you
follow us we just want to talk
sears oh man now we're talking
one of my favorite stores to shop in
there's so much space for activities
because there's no customers hi oh
circuit city went out of business a
decade ago
um but they're just what i needed
excuse me hello hello thank you
this super small business called amazon
i've never heard of it are they related
to the company that does blue horizons
lee's electronics on frasier street now
that is a specific
recommendation derek you
if you look closely at sears logo it
looks a little sus
you know i don't even want to like um
explore that just to because i don't
know where it's possibly going to lead
us it can't be anything good
uh but you know what bothers me about
sears like they're probably like
sweating i mean they're like bankrupt or
whatever but
they're probably really mad because they
used to be called
the sears robot corporation and then
they got rid of the roebuck because
they're like oh i don't know it sounds
too old-timey or something like that
but now if they still had that in their
name
they'd be crushing it because people
would think that it's
related to roblox so all sorts of like
middle schoolers would come in there and
be like
you know they could even sell gift cards
or something like that like they could
have
they could have done really well they
just they you know it's a
bad timing it was a black swan event
i will say i was at the the post office
and you know the post office
uh is connected to uh
not a department store anyway it's
connected to a retail outlet
um the retail outlet sells
gift cards so i was looking at him while
i was waiting in line
and uh they had
xbox live gift cards no joke
they had uh the branding on them was
call of duty advanced warfare
which i'm pretty sure came out in 2014.
okay you gotta go yeah you gotta go
i will not be hit here
and it was like the the stack was full
it was like
it wasn't like they just had a couple of
extra advanced warfare ones like
literally
there were like eight or nine in the
in the area and they were all just you
know hanging out there
and the ones i do see that tinted rock
but we need to save our bombs for now
just just chill for a sec
um don't forget
the family jewels um
the the most the and it's hard to tell
right because maybe they recently
restocked
however the most empty
gift certificate or gift card that was
there was uh
roblox for sure like the roblox one only
had one
thing sticking in it and the fortnite uh
one had like two or three
all right all right
i'm not sweating that tinted rock right
now honestly
yes tinted rock correct yes you're not
wrong
that's smart money baby
we need the bombs yeah you got it you
got it all figured out
i used to work at toys r us and we uh
sold out of roblox cards all the time i
remember what it was like
to not be 18 and thus not have a credit
card
and have to rely on i mean even like the
gift card industry really
only kind of came up after i became
an adult age i suppose
but uh to always have to run
like buy because i had my mom's credit
card hooked up to xbox live
to always have to like run it by her
that was like hey mom i'm gonna spend
like 10 bucks on xbox live if that's
cool with you
and then uh she'd be like what's it for
and you had to be like
they remade teenage mutant ninja turtles
1989 from the arcade
and put it on xbox live arcade for ten
dollars i'd really like to buy the play
with my friends
so embarrassing man
it was before micro transactions really
hit though
mom do you release the new paris map for
project gotham racing 2.
no my mom you almost always said yes to
that kind of stuff but i do have to say
like i know how this this looks like
it's very self-aggrandizing
but i really didn't ask very often
like even as a child i was not like the
desire to purchase things was
was very low
i very rarely found myself being like oh
i need to buy like horse armor or
whatever
that's good now a real rune finally some
real freaking runes
oh you don't know horse armor
kids these days
now that's a call back
did not take damage we need we need some
extra support here
um like an item that is uh it helps us
do more damage in particular would be
very nice
i believe to the best of my knowledge
horse armor was the first micro
transaction
it's the first micro transaction that i
remember let's put it that way
that was not simply like more content
like
like more maps an expansion pack etc etc
now bethesda got uh roasted for it for
sure
what they should have done is simply
release
uh loot boxes that gave you a chance to
get something
including horse armor and then people
would have been like pog
it's like you know virtual trading cards
they wouldn't have said pog they would
have been like epic
what an epic idea bethesda
like a boss
you're yeah i was going to say there's
an enemy in there i i'm starting to
remember these rooms
i guess we should have per throat yeah
we should still go back in per throw
what am i talking about here
what am i talking about um
i don't know is this any good
um
people i'm here to tell you gamers you
gotta relax
on team cherry okay stop
stop bugging them about silk song all
right they'll get to it when they get to
it like just freaking chill out oh my
god
it's like i get it you want to play more
hollow night but just relax
man like it's like just a few people
making the game
probably reading that stuff on social
media like trying to figure out a way to
pivot
into the banking industry as quickly as
possible once the game's actually done
just chill out man okay i'm going to
blank roon first
that's awas my best best rune best
friend best room
i don't know it's it it looks cool you
gotta admit it looks cool as heck man
i'm just saying you know
i i would love to say don't annoy any
developers but like i mean
i don't know if i could uh stand by that
i mean i think in principle you
shouldn't
but there is in my opinion there's a
little bit of a difference between like
hey man like can i have a wafer thin
piece of news on elden ring
versus like
you know seven uh contracted workers are
trying to make like a dlc to
one of the most or not dlc a sequel to
like one of the most
uh surprise breakout indie gaming hits
of all time and if it's anything that's
less than 11 out of 10 people are gonna
lose their mind like
more curse rooms i say no
spirit heart i say yes
i gotta say red candle might be sick as
well but like i think i need more hp
i think book of revelations is the right
thing to take
star citizen waiting room
dude it is i was thinking about that
when i was watching uh
dan play zomboy today zomboid has been
in development for so long and
i want to preface this by saying it's
gotten
better right like the the game has
gotten better people love it
um however it's been in development for
so long
i literally uh played it for the first
time when i still lived in korea
which is absurd and then star citizen
is like just a year younger than that or
something like that
it's crazy
and at least like yeah dude i don't i
want to know like
what dan's star citizen uh
hanger looks like
i'm not knocking him i think he would be
the first person to crack a joke about
it to be honest but
i do i wonder if i i would
say 95 chance his star citizen hangar is
worth
in the four figures
i think that there's a a chance
anti-pog i think that there's a chance
it could be in the five figures and even
that
as crazy as that is it's not
that bad because there are people that
have like
six figure star citizen accounts
which is just staggering
but i don't know man like what's the
rate of return on those
could could you leave them to your kids
like in your
in your last will and testimony okay
well whatever thanks for the speed boost
it is a better investment than a car no
question there
on the other hand you also can't use
your star citizen spaceship to drive you
to work
so i don't know it's depends where
you're
what you're in for i guess
no i honestly like i mean if you
contributed to their kickstarter
whatever right like
i contributed to a couple kickstarters
we were part of a naive generation
i honestly think like i don't want to
say like we couldn't have known better
but like when kickstarter came out it
was brand new
everybody was just like you know the the
conventional wisdom was like game
developers
you know they want they have the ability
to make the greatest games of all time
it's just those
those nasty publishers are stopping them
from making a game that's like super
metroid but better right
um and then you know you you back a few
and then it comes out and you're like i
mean it's pretty good but it's like
i mean it's mostly just like
it's not you know you promised me that
this would be that even better than
civilization six
and it's kind of like just a nice little
time waster
nowadays i think people are much more
like deservedly skeptical about
crowdfunding or at least
let's not say skeptical necessarily but
like realistic
like i i honestly don't think i would
ever back a kickstarter now
i don't know why i mean like even if it
was like this game won't get made
if it's if you don't give us
look okay let me put it this way if
literally they pitched something on me
that was like
and i have contributed to some in the
past for sure like yeah it contributed
to four souls
um which turned out great but there's
also a couple of games that even like
i i i don't know i feel weird about it
because like
there there are some kickstarter games
where like i
played the game to kind of like
just to play it but also like to promote
the campaign like the developer would
send me
access to like the demo build and then i
would play it on my youtube channel
because it looked cool
and then some people would be like you
know hey i love the video and i backed
it and then you know that was eight
years ago and the game still hasn't come
out and i'm like
you know it's not really my fault but i
feel like i kind of contributed to the
to the engine it's not really a scam
either like you know
i'm sure the developer thought that hey
this will probably be like really easy
and then it's uh
you know seven years later and people
are like have you thought about adding
like a 3d version and they're like sure
let's do it and there's some good ones
for sure
some some great stuff's come out by a
kickstarter i think the ftl advanced
edition was a kickstarter thing
but anyway i'm just i don't know
if if you created a situation where it
was like
literally your 10 contribution will
decide whether or not the game gets
funded
i would fund a lot no doubt
the flip side uh excuse me angel deal
please
i have no idea how that will work but i
i don't really want to mess with what i
got going on here to be honest with you
the flip side of that though is like
if something's like a few thousand
dollars away and they're like well if
you signal boost this then it might get
made i'm like i don't know man i feel
like this
it's not really my uh that's not
i don't i don't wanna get all spider-man
one but i'm like uh you know
i miss the part where that's my problem
but it's like i don't know man
it's not my responsibility
what about an anti-kickstarter where you
could give them money to stop them from
making something
now we're talking it's an interesting
idea like
so daniel and chat's saying i uh i only
reported
uh on kickstarters that had already
crossed their funding goal
that seems like a good way of getting
around it for sure
i think we're good dead dead
dead dead let's do it
i'm just trying to make sure i'm not
missing anything i think we're i think
we're okay
i'd love to see a new game from the ftl
guys yo
you might i didn't go to the alt path
okay we'll go
we at least we still have true ending we
still have true ending okay
my bad
i even spent the hb
yeah anyway what i was going to say
before i got the uh cyberbullied for
being stupid
uh that's right you gotta gotta drop a
trinket man
but we can't drop a drink because we're
already here you can do it here okay we
can do it
we can do it here all right all right
all right so we'll do do we have to do
it on the boss fight or do we do it on
the
on the default room do it on the default
room
there you go this is fine
not fine you have to do it on the boss
fight
it's i or in the item room okay in the
item room i can do that i can do that
you can't just leave it in a default
room what i was gonna say though
is if you haven't um played into the
breach
it's the second game from the ftl
team uh and it's extremely great
and i i would it was well loved at
release
but i would still say it's like a little
underrated
you don't hear people like talking about
it in the same reverential
way that you hear them talking about uh
about ftl i think it's
a an unbelievably good game
and don't get me wrong ftl is great
anyway that's my thoughts on kickstarter
it's kind of like i don't know
like it really it's hard to put yourself
like back in the mindset we were in back
in like 2014.
indie games were like still pretty much
brand new
and the quality of the ones that came
out and got pressed was by and large
like you know like they were all
classics braid
limbo super meat boy you know like
for a while it was basically like now
that these developers have been freed
from
you know the the economic chains of a
publisher like they can truly make these
classics
and then like you know in the in the
intervening few years
the average quality is dipped as more
people have gotten into it i don't mean
that in like a negative way
but like you know there's there's a lot
of garbage that comes out
there's a lot of amazing games that come
out as well um
i think people are more oh dude apollo
raid thank you
dude apollo you love this part of the
raid this part of the stream we're
talking negatively about video games
hello apollo chad i've been spying on
you
via uh apollo's unban requests
any anyway so i was just talking about
how i will never support a kickstarter
again
and have not for many years but um okay
thank you thank you for the 9 volts
let's donate a bunch as well leave your
trinket behind in the item room that's
right thanks i didn't forget i was just
trying to make you
feel like i forgot
saved and i got you i can't believe
you're so
god
oh man okay and then we still need oh
can't fly that's right well you know
what let's go back and buy that spirit
hard
derek you derek you
star citizen is like a whole that's a
whole thing man
the games raised like like 400 million
dollars or something like that
there's the tinted skull and it's still
i don't even know if it's like any
closer to coming out
it was like a meme in
2016. okay
we need the card
i remember i i watched because dan was
watching
and reacting to like citizencon one year
not citizen kane that's a totally
different thing citizencon is actually
much better
um it's the star citizen convention
and uh
you expected that like one day
it would be like you know hey we're
gonna stop adding new stuff to the game
and instead we're just gonna like get to
work on like a release date
but that was not what happened instead
they were like hey
guess what we're changing the game
so that you can have like a track ir
you know something that like uh it
basically can track
your facial movements and then when you
talk over
voip your character's face will exactly
mimic the movements that you're making
with your mouth in real life and i was
just like
bro come on like
that's that's don't get me wrong kind of
incredible
and and immersive but at the same time
like
you gotta come out with this game at
some point man and then
they did like a demo where like they
they took off from like the
uh a port a spaceport okay maybe we
should
like focus a little bit uh they took off
from a spaceport and then like went into
outer space
went into light speed and then tried to
land on
another planet and then when they landed
on the other planet the game just
crashed and i was like
bro like i mean i guess like
maybe it's like a game as a service
where like
we're fine we just take we take the
polaroid because we're blue baby we
leave
unlucky now that didn't happen in the in
the pre-beta
builds and then we have to go back to
the item room now
or on the mausoleum
no later all right because we go to the
mausoleum and then we go worm
okay now i recall thank you thank you
dude i gotta tell you i'm not i'm not
like
really sold on the golden rocks one bomb
for a little bit of money maybe there's
like a cool pay out there but
anyway long story short like
don't believe the hype i guess but i i
do feel like i'm
i end up being like contra positions
versus a lot of the gaming industry
like my hype is at a maximum most of the
time when i'm like playing a game
and uh my hype is at a minimum when i
see like a pre-rendered trailer of it at
uh
at e3
wait until they come out with tetris 100
oh baby
so these are pretty good but are they as
good as pressing the space bar
unknown
yeah i'm not like other gamers i'm a
cool gamer name a gamer
spacebar undefeated something something
been
real quiet since the space bar just
dropped
apollo i don't know if you're here by
the way
but i i noticed you've been playing a
little bit more repentance
might be getting a little into it maybe
might might be starting to feel like
once bitten twice shy
excuse me
excuse me
do you have any friends that work in the
gaming industry um
i have i have but maybe like a friend or
two i would consider to
someone that i would consider to be a
friend that works on the indie side
i have some acquaintances that that work
on
indie and aaa but i wouldn't
like consider myself a source on like
how things really are in the gaming
industry
i just uh
well i guess yeah it depends what you
mean david miyazaki is a uh
is a close friend of mine uh and and of
course he works in the
he works in the games industry but
on the marketing side as opposed to the
the development side
actually you know yeah i guess i got
multiple friends that work on the indie
side but
um i wouldn't you know i i don't
consider myself like a source
all i have is like you know my
experience having
been around it for a while i mean i have
i've been around it for like a decade
now which is
like embarrassing to say
but i do i find myself often times being
like
i feel like i have the opposite opinion
of a lot of other people in the industry
like i even while we were talking about
this so i saw someone say like you know
well you can't trust like the gaming
industry because
it's trash and i was like man like i'm
in the exact opposite boat
i'm like i don't believe hype at all but
i think the gaming industry is kind of
amazing
just you know they're making toys and
then they're you know sometimes selling
them at a bit of a markup but i don't
you know i think that's just the system
we're in
you know i just i mean but then again
i've also said like
you know after watching chib's crazy
time
stream i now understand uh that gambling
addiction is like a real thing and not
merely something i intellectually know
exists uh so i guess like
i don't feel as comfortable as i used to
feel being like hey if you don't like
micro transactions like don't buy them
because now i'm like okay i understand i
guess what i'm saying is if you like
gotcha games why not just go to like a
real casino
because at least like if you win you win
something real
instead of uh something
uh fictional sorry but
at the same time you know what i mean
real casinos don't have cute anime
ladies they're gonna
one of these days they're gonna figure
that out
and then a lot of people are gonna lose
their life savings
like i was just going to say i've never
i've never been in like a pachinko
parlor but do they have that
they have cute anime waifus like at the
pachinko parlor
they don't yet they do okay
oh don't don't remind me of the maid
cafe man
yeah remind me to go to all item rooms i
just i'm not to risk anything we're
going to every single one of these
i still i i can't believe i've been
talking about crazy time for like two
days
but um i mean it was a remarkable piece
of entertainment
all credit to chip there but okay next
floor next floor
um
i was stunned that like on this online
casino
there were a decent amount of people
playing crazy time but crazy time is
like a real production
they have a set they have camera
operators they have uh
props you know they then they've got a
real like a cast of actors or dealers or
however you want to describe them or
whatever
oh there it is it was under my items i
got so scared
um but then also like on the casino
there was a lot of like um games that
were
literally just like tomb of the pharaohs
and then when you boot it up it's like a
1994
like 386 kind of graphics that are just
going like
they're dirty and you're just like
really
people are i mean there's not there's no
overhead associated with that website at
all
it's crazy okay
if you vibe hard enough the feelings
can't get to you
like again that's oh my god
sorry sorry i felt the tilt coming on
that you were like funny joke but can
you focus on the game for a second okay
i got out of it i got out of it
i i felt the i felt the emotion rise
inside of me and i swallowed it and i
i mentioned it and then we're moving on
um
hey really entertaining and all but i
don't come here to be entertained i come
here to get the dopamine that comes from
a victory in game
okay here we go now that we've made one
snippy comment about it we can move on
but i mean like if that what the heck is
this guy
if that doesn't have you believing that
like gambling addiction is a real thing
that people are literally like i will
use the
absolute like most boring game of all
time
as a vessel to create good feelings like
it's kind of crazy right it literally it
just looks like super nintendo graphics
like spinning five different reels and
you're like pog
like i got six osirises
at least crazy time had like a there was
like a fake social element to it as well
that's why i'm like i'm surprised crazy
time has not swallowed more people's
lives
no i've been to vegas a few times i
really don't i mean i
again i talked about it even yesterday
so i apologize but
i uh
i wouldn't say like i'm immune to the
positive feelings from gambling but like
i don't feel the pull at all
like when i when i see someone eating
doritos i'm like man i could really go
for some doritos
when i see someone that's like on a slot
machine or something like that i'm like
i just i don't know i if anything i just
want to remove myself from
the casino as soon as possible
f doritos dude you know what i did have
um
saved you know what i did have is uh
at the same time that i bought that
spark mouth
um sparkling water the superior
sparkling water brand
i bought is that what it's called
very spicy
chili lime tortilla chips and
they were they were delicious
not tackys it's p-a-q-u-i
not takis
oh they make the one chip challenge i
didn't know
i was eating them and i was like you
know what
these are genuinely like not so spicy as
to be like intolerable i mean
i heard the one chip challenge is
obviously designed to be really bad i
didn't do that
um but uh
actually like more spicy than you would
expect like a
a snack to to be
one chip challenge nobody's ever
succeeded
watch merely one chip stream can't be
done can't be done
you know what we can do now that i think
about it on
is what level is this downpour one if we
go to the library and we have a full
charge
we might be able to suck up all those
books that we left behind and create
more more wisps
than have ever existed in humanity
before
excuse me sir you should be dead you you
can't have this much hp
does the library stay i don't know i
will assuage chat and i will go down to
the uh
the item room here i'm gonna do it the
only thing is
if the item room is empty because i
already picked it up you owe me
a million dollars
what the heck fair enough
[Laughter]
i don't want to suck it up though
because golden teleporter is going to
screw us
so i'm just going to take this and hope
it works well with static tears
yes and no
oh because we didn't get to go to this
item room because of uh
yeah because of the planetarium
oh it gives you miniature isaac's when
you get hit that's right that's right no
thank you
rippy thank you for the gifted
subscription as well thank you
i did just use um oh the library didn't
stay anyway
i did use my charge which i shouldn't
have done yeah thank you
rip g
dude anyone here from vancouver i know
that like
we've talked about this in the past but
uh there was another viral video from
vancouver today of a
white bmw driving uh on the pedestrian
path
of the sea wall did you see this
i was laughing is so good
and then like so basically the sea wall
is like this really nice
it's right on the edge of the water and
it goes throughout like the whole city
um there's a bike path there's a walking
path
you know jogging path sort of thing um
and it's very clearly marked again
there's like
you know i pictures of human beings or
pictures of bicycles and stuff like that
um but i was i've been talking about it
i talk about with corey a lot
about how like every once in a while
you'll just see like a car
somehow find its way onto either the
bike path or the pedestrian path and
people are like
i don't believe you go watch the video i
think it's number one
on our vancouver right now and you can
also see
that most people that are just walking
by
are not even that concerned they're just
like this is something that happens
maybe once every six months
and i see it but i was laughing because
in the reddit thread
there's like uh there's a little bit of
apologia
there's people that are like like one
guy i saw was like
okay so he shouldn't have gone under the
pedestrian path but like
in his defense why is it so hard to get
off of the pedestrian path
once you're on it and people are like uh
because
it's you're not supposed to get on it in
the first place if they made more spots
to get
off of it it would be easier for people
to accidentally get onto it
like it's it's it's just hilarious so
people are like honestly
like a lot of people are like haha this
guy should have his driver's license
taken away
which i kind of agree with because he is
literally driving into like you know a
crowd of people
um and almost reversed into a guy a
couple of times
but uh the other thing is like there's
some people in there that are like
man must be nice to be a redditor and
never make a mistake and you're like
well i mean i've made mistakes while
driving don't get me wrong but i've
never accidentally
you know taken a wrong turn and ended up
uh
you know on the pedestrian path
that's not like that's even worse than
going the wrong way on the road it's
like
because you're casual confirmed
confirmed casual
oh baby
yeah yeah why not look at that
look at that scale of one to ten how
easy is it to accidentally get onto that
path
the soiled has been unlocked um
i mean how easy is it to do if you if
you wanted to do it it's like probably a
two out of ten
you would have to make one turn that's
like a little tight
we're chilling to do it
accidentally i mean i i don't know
i think i i can't really answer how hard
it is to do
what i can answer is how easy it is to
avoid
and the answer is very easy
like i i know this is kind of like a
recurring topic of conversation but
like i see people turn into the bike
lane all the time accidentally and i'm
like
bro it's pretty easy to avoid finding
yourself
in the bike lane here's the thing a
it's like narrower than the width of
your car
and then secondarily it's the lane with
a bike painted on the ground
if if you're if your car is a bike you
can go in there
but didn't you wonder why there were
like you know
no other cars there but lots of cars six
inches away from it i don't know
i did dude i it's kind of like my
anxiety nightmare
but i i do have to admit that i was kind
of loving how people were punking the
guy in the car
like i get it he made a mistake
but the fact that like people were
crowding the driver's side window and
like taking his photo and stuff like
that
i was like yeah get him deserved
done okay
i thought we got more spirit arts there
uh there there go my familiar oh every
time every time man
i will say i saw slim dirty dizzy i saw
you talking about
in seattle there's cars like in the bus
only lane
i must admit like i think when i'm in
seattle i'm driving properly
but there are times where like the lane
says bus only
it's it's painted like you know red or
whatever
but i'm like i gotta turn right so i
just get in the lane and turn right is
that's this that must be what you're
supposed to do right
like i can't imagine they're like nah
turn right from the center lane
or is it literally like sorry you just
can't turn right there
you can turn okay save saved
and then the other thing is every time
i'm in washington i have to like
go through the exact same thought
process every time which is
is this a place where you can turn on
right or a place where you can't turn on
right
and i i still do not know
usually i just hang out at the red light
until
uh i'm gonna die for certain
i hang out at the at the red light
yeah yeah sorry on red on red um
i hang out at the red light until
somebody behind me honks
if they honk i'm like all right i can
turn my bad
sorry it wasn't that i don't know how to
drive i was just like looking at my
phone or something
it's nothing embarrassing um
and if they don't honk i'm like thank
god i didn't turn i could have broken
the law and be thrown into american
prison
most places you can like america
i mean i'm not gonna say it's weird it's
just like you know it's different i've
told this story before but like when we
were in portland at a magic the
gathering tournament this was a long
time ago at a different point in my life
um we had to get gas before we drove
back to vancouver
and uh like i went to the gas station
and i was about to get out of my
driver's side
and then this guy who looked like axel
rose came up and like
knocked on my window really loudly and i
was like what the heck's going on
and then i was i didn't even roll down
the window i just went like
yes and then he was like can i help you
and i was like
you knocked and he was like what kind of
gas do you want and then it quickly
dawned on me that this is one of the
parts of the world that
has other people pump your gas for you
i guess oregon is a is a full-service
gasoline state
well we're gonna we're gonna have a
chance maybe oh no we got one more here
oh in oregon they've they've made
fricken
they've made self-service a thing now
okay all right but
i mean full service is stupid but you
know
it i'm just being honest if it helps the
economy
then so be it like every time i'm in
japan they've always got like a bunch of
senior citizens
standing on insanely busy roads with
those like click counters
and i'm like bro they make sensors that
could do that in like 10 seconds
for a dollar um but at the same time
you know if it keeps the if it keeps the
economy rolling then so be it
anyway slash marker um
we lost but we unlocked
new blue baby



all right
i i promised tainted as hazel
you shall have tainted as hazel
is weak walking azazel
lil brim how come my brim looks like
this so that hers can look like this
i don't know what else i got to say this
video is over
do a half charge whoa what the
oh that's kind of cool you got a little
you may find yourself
shooting little shotgun blasts
oh hey hey
dude no joke if we're talking
10 out of 10 songs once in a lifetime
it's got to be up there
i don't think i've ever heard once in a
lifetime and been like man turn this off
i'm sick of it
good song catchy tune good message
danceable look naive melody is a great
song as well this must be the place
um i think i think it's a beautiful song
there have been times though
where i've been like you know what i
don't need to hear this again
once in a lifetime if there was a
serious xm
satellite radio station that played once
in a lifetime
24 7. i would turn it on now and then
i would probably let it play like four
or five songs
then i would change it but any time that
i could just
knowing that i could just turn on the
station and and have it whenever i
wanted
that would be worth a lot to me
i will say i don't know what the heck
he's talking about when he's like
you know there's water at the bottom of
the ocean you're like yeah dude
duh tell me something i don't know go
back to telling me about a shotgun shack
david byrne hey david why don't you get
brian eno to help you
shore up the the lyrics on uh verse
three
all that work for for bum friend huh
there's this new service called spotify
you should check out
um all i do
is i go to google play music and then it
goes go to youtube music so then i go to
youtube music
and i type in dry the rain
by the beta band and then i click the
three little
um like the hamburger menu next to
dry the rain and i say start radio from
this
and then it starts trying to play me
like a bunch of stuff like um
it's like hey do you want to listen to
carry the zero by built to spill
and i'm like nah i kind of just want to
listen to like dry the rain no
disrespect
so i just keep listening to like that
over and over
yo this little shotgun brim it's got
some good stuff going on
look at that blast them
i said don't get me wrong i had nothing
against built to spill carry the zero
the plan you were you were wrong
randy describes eternity like there's
some classics in there
i feel like yankee with no brim here
dude look at this like this is
this is crazy help me
help help help me
john dude i'm telling we need some
challenge in our life let's try it
i'm not scared
no
i'm extremely scared we don't have the
kind of power to take out these enemies
before they take us out
i can't believe i didn't get hit are you
kidding me
accidental greatest dodge of all time
also i don't have spotify i think i
talked about this before but like
i either linked it to my um
my university email account or i linked
it to my
facebook account one of the two i no
longer have access to my university
email account
and i deleted my facebook account so
like i'm pretty sure i created like a
ghost
record on the spotify database and i
can't get back in
but now so basically like to use spotify
i got to make like a whole new email
account just to log in
that's a lot of work man
i don't want to talk to customer support
that seems like it's annoying
just listen to once in a lifetime it's
horrible
absolute trash my god
it's quite a this is a strong opinion
you know what you should do if you hate
it so much just try listening to it
again because it
it's not a one you don't really get it
on the first listen it's only the second
listen that
that really i think it really starts to
hit hello
chicken look at that it's the baby
it's the baby it's the baby wearing
purple it's the baby
it's the baby wearing purple
yeah go ahead bomb friend out of the
goodness of my heart you can have these
but don't drop any items here drop them
here thank you thank you

watch

moment of peace

i might i would lose my mind for sure
that when when the alert goes off you
feel stressed

a new email like every morning that's
the worst part of my morning which is
why i do it first i wake up and check my
email
people don't contact me
unless they want something
be that as it may it still hurts
i don't want them to message me though
that's why i don't that's why i don't

reply they're gonna message me more
i didn't even want the original message
it is a me problem you're not wrong
jerry
i'm like i still like i'm stunned at the
way pr works i know i do this bit once
every three months but i'm still like
every once in a while i'll get an email
from somebody that works in the industry
that i've never heard of
and they're like breaking news under
embargo
please do not talk about this until like
17 days from now and i'm like i don't
even know who you i didn't agree to this
you could you can just get an email from
a stranger that's like here's a secret
by the way you can't tell anybody
i don't get it i don't i don't
understand but i'm for it
sometimes i tell secrets
oh yeah they tell me all the time oh
all the time

super handsome and i have a big crush on
him

already knew that
i was like i knew it
man you know like hey
lord help me you're going to make me
cyber bully again

creativity
sorry we got a damage upgrade

this dude killed himself for death's
list excuse me um
in this stream we don't call me this
dude
we call me uh egg or hey you
papa etc etc something like that
mark mark is another word you could use
to describe me
i don't understand i didn't see it in
time i suppose
it's mister this dude do you ah so true
okay i hope you know that like what
you're doing right now with the baby
interrupting focus
is like imagine if you were in the
jungle and then like lee sin
came in there and was like uh oh hey
here's my meepo bombs
and you were like i gotta dodge these
but also like i gotta be a mom
right now and you're like cons i can't
hear calms because uh
like the baby's going like all the time
and i
have to keep talking because i know
you're just waiting for when i stop and
you're gonna go haha so true so i gotta
like just keep spinning this endlessly
not give you the opportunity for you to
respond to it because i know you're just
going to respond with the punch line
uh
[Laughter]
okay no no not yet not yet not yet
i'm a genius what he didn't freeze when
i did mom's bra
oh because he's not moving it's the
track that moves
wait it's the minecart that moves it's
the cigars you smoke
derek you derek you
i i can't believe it we actually got a
good item
that's kind of an amazing item that's
kind of
a guarantee that we're gonna go down to
the
uh the alt path dude we have to like i
need the damage
but if we go to all paths we're
definitely gonna die but on the other
hand like
if we don't do it then like we never
truly lived
you know what i mean you don't have the
knife
nevertheless
so dead haha so so true
saved dude bob's brain brimstone bombs
dude
bob's brain brimstone bombs little
pac-man ghost
let's wait for bob's brain to come back
okay hello baby
um i'm in trouble
don't shoot dude stinky
now we need yeah sad bombs and homing
bombs and we're out of control
land it land it it's going to make
death's list tougher but now that i
think about it like why do i care about
death's list anyway because it's
the worst item in the game
what
oh yeah so like somehow
you're gonna laugh and i'm dead okay
you're gonna think that i'm putting on
airs but the our knife sharpener
like i tightened it two days ago because
i felt it getting a little loose
and then like it's it it came off in the
knife rack
so like we just have a handle and then
we have like a metal
cylinder stuck in the knife rack so i
don't know like what the heck we're
gonna do about that
what did you tell me i don't know it's
not like a red alert
you know i just saw like a handle
floating
[Laughter]
and i said what's this yeah we got knife
piece one here
so i guess yeah we got to get like a
magnet and pull it out or something like
that
there you go you can take that back all
right i'm not sure
about you know like while we're here why
not why not
let's let's just run it back slash
marker
tainted azazel but good this
time
baby it's okay you're all right sweetie
i will say i'm not trying to like start
anything with this
but remember there was like a week ago
where i made that uh thinly veiled
comment where i was like
it this the baby time is overlapping
with stream time
more and more over time
i i feel like the message was not
received and now this is the second
stream in a row where
my stream has become complete
babysitting time again
you know baby
[Laughter]
it's like i don't i don't really mind
but like it creates like
an echo effect for me where like you
know then like i have a little trouble
concentrating and then these
come out on youtube and there's people
that are like you know why is the baby
crying in the episode and then i'm like
i you know she's a baby that's what
babies do
as a whole creates a situation with a
certain degree of
antagonism potentially would be the word
i would use
it's okay baby frog likes
to hop hop pop she jumps in the water
look at the duck of the duck splish
splash
woo
frog likes to hop up
i'm a hippo that's friendly look at my
big tommy
push me pull me tickle me i'm so much
fun
you will see there you go stun locked
gets unlocked baby
she do be saying oh oh though she do be
saying a lot of oh
oh i think singing to the baby has made
me
a better singer i'm just going to go
ahead and call it
honey what's wrong
baby's a great co-host don't get me
wrong
you know if this killed enemies a little
faster
i would be into it but it
what do you sing to her i had
i go this is the definition of my life
lying in or sometimes i go um you know
baby mario rpg
baby the hedgehog baby kong 3 adventures
of
baby one and two baby baby baby foo
baby moon
link baby pokemon baby and earl in panic
on baby tron
ninja baby one ninja baby two
ninja baby three baby usa
sounds like the barons who like raymond
barone or robert barone
more debra
your voice so beautiful from italia
that's that's a reference um oh cockatoo
thank you again thank you
it's a reference to the crazy time
in-game chat from
from chib's stream
if you're from italy do you call it
italia is that
is that like um the italian word for
italy
yes okay all right i thought it was just
a flex
like they're just putting a little extra
sauce on it like check it out i'm from
italy
and in italy we say italia
i thought it was like a brag
baby
if you sneeze enemies into walls they
take double damage
that's pretty sick oh geez i charged it
up too much uh that's not sick
oh my god it's amazing oh not the barons
the band baroness i thought you were
talking about rubber
man
okay so like i've ruined it by taking
mom's knife
but i think i've also in doing that made
it much better
so i'm not sweating it
one of my favorite bits is uh responding
to the baby's comments
with something that makes you think that
i
understand what the baby said
like during the stream not the stream
today during the youtube
recordings today the baby made some
noise and i said that would all be well
and good baby but who's going to pay for
it
and i was like that
oh that's a fun that's a funny bit
anyway oh frick
who so so true
we're doing all now that we got mom's
knife you have to do alt path that's the
rule
haha you think about everything don's
you
talk stocks with the baby baby did you
see v eqt was up 0.94
today it was a banner day for the broad
market
she's like i don't care yeah you have no
reason to carry your resp is in
xgro so like you know it's an astute
baby right there
yeah that's right my baby holds 20 bonds
you got a problem
this is a good pill i'm just
i here's how confident i am that it's a
good pill
i was gonna pop it on the room and i did
oh what the
is not an okay pill let's just be honest
it was bad but that's fine
does the baby watch mad money it's her
favorite show
right after bluey ends she's like daddy
can you put on jim cramer
but sometimes like honestly and i was
gonna tweet this because i think it
could do
it could do numbers she said
daddy does it ever surprise you that jim
cramer
has a career in public media relations
despite the fact that he admitted to
being a market maker
when he was a hedge fund manager and now
as a result his attempt to style himself
into kind of the people's champion
and a populist investor falls on deaf
ears because of all the money that he
took from the everyman
you know during the 90s and i said wow
baby kids
kids say the darnedest things you know
the mind of a child is a is a
fascinating thing
i will take spider mod thank you
i mean we gotta try to get the knife
piece here why not
she said ruth conda forever
wait what this this creates a peeper's
eye right
you know a song i haven't heard in a
long time is when
uh that one that goes oh with my naked
eye i saw
the falling rain pouring down on me
with my naked eye i saw
what set it off could it be you know
that one i haven't heard that one in a
long time
i haven't heard that song in a billion
years
how do you know who that's by is it's by
luscious jackson
how do you know that who is that
luscious jackson is great do they have
any other pieces
it's an older song
do you remember when also they do not
okay thank you
do you remember when there was that song
that was like
it's sampled you're so vain and you
couldn't escape
it but it was like i bet you think this
song is about you
i bet you think this song is about you
oh you're so vain i bet you think this
song is about you
don't you don't you you remember that
there's a lot of songs from that era
that have just been they've just been
abandoned
ah the baby is like please make a
punchline baby i'm trying okay
i'm trying like another one you don't
hear
at all anymore is i'm only happy when it
rains
i'm only happy when it's something
she's like you love that one
she loves it that's literally by garbage
yeah like i said it's no good feel the
rain on your
pog no one else can feel it for you
you know i'm just trying i'm spinning
whatever i can get out of this
feel the pog on your skin no one else
can feel it for you
oh you're welcome
i did own one now cd i don't know if
canadian now that's what i call music is
different
from uh from american
in track one here you can you can
reverse engineer it track one
was new radicals you get what you give
great song
track four was the sweetest thing by
youtube
it also had jennifer page's crush on it
it's just
just a little crush crush the gezero
every time we touch it also had
uh robbie williams millennium on it
um it also had
there was there was some good stuff i
think it had the boy is mine
by monica featuring brandy i can't
recall
who who
okay see we'll do
see you in 30 minutes that is now that's
what i call music two
how about that no now four
sounds more right to me i seem to recall
now
for maybe there's a little like final
fantasy thing where it gets like
you know as it crosses the border it
changes it's different in canada and
america i don't know
i mean back in the day the now albums
were like
you know it's not very artful
you know you know it's not it doesn't
respect the lp
as a uh as an art form
but if you were only buying albums for
the singles
you basically got like 20 radio jams
for the price of one cd you know and
that's way better like
you'd buy an album and it would be like
i i really only wanted
the album for the single every other
song on it's a piece of garbage
you know happened all the time back in
the day
like bewitched self-titled debut album
some people say i look like me da are
you serious
uh oh
i would never be upset as a child if i
received as a gift and now that's what i
call music album
hm
i support it with my inner eye i saw
in january they released now that's what
i call music 77
it's a lot but like what are you gonna
um
like it's not like you can say like it's
oh
they're just pumping them out there like
it's obviously a commodification you
know like it's
it's devoid of artistic intent
it's just the compilation of of music
if anything i'm kind of surprised
they're not on like 177 by now
appreciate the money thank you
how do they compete with streaming that
i will say i have no idea
i don't understand how artists make
money anymore
at all like if you're getting like
millions of streams a month on spotify
maybe
what a shot but like apart from that
like aren't you just screwed
touring i guess well you know in the
before times
sure
advertising
advertising makes sense dude if i was an
artist and i was in a position
where um you know i could sell out and
put my song in a commercial i would do
it
freaking no time absolutely
i would put it in a commercial for like
you know the department of defense i
don't care
give me the bag
wouldn't bother me slight in the
slightest i would much rather sell yeah
no
see that's where i'm at 10 out of 10 i
would rather
sell out my song to like applebee's or
something like that
than make a single christmas song to pay
the bills i would do either if i had to
but if you're like hey would you rather
like give outback steakhouse
the rights to your music to sell bloom
and onions or would you rather
make a a bluesy parody of like
santa claus is coming to town i would be
like let's pretend we don't exist
let's go two out back tonight
two seconds i i honestly i had that
e-signature over to you before it even
settled in my inbox
i feel like you don't hear people talk
about selling out that much anymore
when i was a burgeoning snob in the mid
2000s
it was always like people were like oh
they sold out and i mean
we didn't invent it we inherited it but
i feel like now people are kind of like
oh they still do
okay well it shows what i know
i thought now people were like man you
know artists got to make money
shiny
don't forget the family jewels
now it's all about industry plants i
don't even know what that means are you
talking about like echinacea
or or grass
are you talking about grass
billy elish i don't know what that mean
people are just typed billy elish as if
i know what that means
related to the phrase industry plants i
have i have no clue what this means
what does it mean like i know what the
words are i just don't know what
they mean when they're put together like
that
her brother wrote bad guy okay
so what i
you know why don't you call me if her
brother is a bad guy and then maybe i'll
have an opinion
oh she was a pre-planned musical project
disguised as a hit from nowhere okay
i understand like an avril lavigne sort
of thing
i thought it was like because sometimes
you can have like a plant in the
audience
at like a a magic show so i was like
what you have like
i was still trying to work it through in
my head i was like you got somebody in
the audience over concert that's like
this
is the best song i've ever heard and
then everyone's like
yeah i get it
he's absolutely right
yeah i don't know anything about all
that stuff basically
do you know i read that this was maybe
like a year ago
i read a written history of the
production
of uh
oops i did it again by britney spears
so like as far as i know
essentially all of britney spears songs
of her first two album
first two albums i should say were
written by this
swedish consortium of uh songwriters
there's a sentence for you
and they were so successful
that after the first two albums like
after they wrote
oops i did it again they were actually
like we hate being famous
and they just retired that's crazy man
it's like when a superhero retires you
wrote like some unbelievable jams but
you're like i'm too powerful
and i will go to say or i'll go to bed
and say
oops i did it again
a consumable slice of pop goodness
oops i'll never do it again baby
let me i don't think i got hit i don't
think they counted it
let's take send it send it
we have so many knives it is funny
though right like
when i think of you've got a great
example i'm gonna steal it and then
pretend it was my own
i picture the writing of california
girls being katy perry sitting down at
like a desk
or like in a recording studio and being
like
what's the best state to sing about
california new york okay the
empire state of mind just came out we
can't do that california girls it is
okay and then
we got to get some innuendo in there
they'll melt your popsicle
popsicle kind of looks like a you know
what when it melts it gets a little drip
going down it
people don't even know that they're
being incepted but they know that
they know what they're thinking when
they see it um
but really it was written by like a
middle-aged husband and wife
swedish business
just picture them like on a on a dim
stockholm day the sun has just risen
it's 1 15 pm in november
california goes is undeniable
there's more german than swedish but i'm
doing my best
sun kissed skin
bikinis unlock
and then they're eating some like
they're they're doing fika
because that's that's when you eat a
cinnamon bun right i know i know things
about culture
we can we can make swedish jokes they're
asleep right now it's late there
don't hurt me okay this is a good run we
got good momentum
what up now swedes whoa we are not
asleep
actually i wonder what
um i wonder what
makes sweden have such a history
with english pop music you know abba
robin annie
other swedish artists
such as peter bjorn and john
etc etc he's so good
he's so good he's so good he's so good
i'm trapped
you've summoned the swedes um peter
forsberg peter forsberg peter forsberg
okay
that should keep him at bay for a bit
do vancouver and sweden have a
connection as far as i'm concerned
genuinely how did we not take damage
genuinely thanks to the vancouver
canucks but uh
i uh i got nothing against sweden man
marcus nazlin the the sedin twins elias
patterson
alex adler jacob markstrom
sadly jacob markstrom uh had to go back
to his home planet
of sweden he no longer his career in the
in the nhl is now over yeah volvo i
don't know what that has to do with the
canucks but he's right volvo
do the canucks have any finnish players
um do we
uh we have perennial draft bust only you
a levy trying to finally crack his way
uh into our the top the worst top six
defense in the nhl right now for his
17th year in a row
i forget who else we must have other
finnish players i don't know
how's holby doing uh
below replacement level nhl backup
and uh being paid like six and a half
million dollars a year
but that's not i'm like i'm not blaming
braden holtby like
i mean everybody on the in the canucks
fandom was like you know
we kind of know that that's a real
percentage chance
[Laughter]
because that was not an unlikely thing
to happen so i don't
he seems like a nice guy like braden
holtby he seems like he's a
he's a cool dude i'm not going to be mad
at
a hockey player for like how much a
general manager decided to pay them
i choose not to take it
set up the item room quick
donkey
like people are really mad at louis
erickson i forgot we also have louis
erickson on the canucks
one of the greatest empty net scores of
all time um
people are mad at him because he gets
paid six million dollars a year and he's
actually like
extremely bad and they're like if i were
him i would have retired to save the
team some salary cap
are you kidding me if i was getting paid
six million dollars a year to
to sit in the press box i would
i mean you'd have to freaking
i didn't case myself in the building
you'd have to
chisel me out it's actually a dream job
he's getting paid six and a half million
dollars a year to pay
to play hockey and he doesn't even have
to play hockey i don't even know if they
have him going to practice
don't do think of the team though dude
won't stay think
think of the dude absolutely not it's
not like you
bully the the general manager hey nerd
give me a billion dollars you know they
were like would you like a billion
dollars and you said sure
it is people are they're very
anti-players sometimes
i always love when like a player takes a
pay cut
to take a uh a no trade clause
and then when they you know age into
badness
and they want to trade them for some
draft picks and the player uses their no
trade clause they're like he's not a
team player
and you're like what are you sorry
there's a tinted rock somewhere bottom
left
bottom left name a tinted rock oh frick
like they they took a pay cut and
they're like wow i love him took a pay
cut to
get on a team friendly deal we love it
and then they want to trade him for like
a third round pick and they're like
screw you
i would oh that's an item that's not an
enemy
i would totally like i would rip my kids
out of school in order to
just play six extra games of hockey in
like you know
minnesota instead of the beautiful
pacific northwest no offense minnesota
no offense
no offense minnesota no offense but like
if you had the choice
no offense um
offense taken
we're good to go i just want to make
sure i'm not making a crucial mistake
here
hey i've been to minnesota once on our
way back from apax east there was an
incredible snowstorm that kept us from
taking off from minneapolis so we got
stuck
in in the twin cities for a night
i have nothing negative to say about
minnesota honestly
except for the fact that the airport is
pretty nice
you got a good airport in minneapolis st
paul
um and then i mean i don't know what
else you want me to say
it was cold i was only there for like a
day
but it was definitely cold i think that
you you come by that stereotype honestly
but i i have said a few times
were i to choose um an american state to
live in
minnesota would not be on the top of the
list because it's
uh cold predominantly
um but i think it would be within the
top ten
which is the top 20 of the united states
nothing wrong with that what's number
one i don't know like probably
washington state
it would be like i just have to be
honest like it would probably go like
washington oregon
california i don't know like if you
if you uh
if you factor if you take price out of
it it does also alter things as well
like i don't know i've never been to
hawaii but it does look pretty sick
palm trees beautiful bikinis on lock did
they melt your popsicle
texas would be on the list believe it or
not i mean
it i think it would also be in the top
ten it's a noteworthy state i mean
like i just you know you're gonna
it's rude okay but there are just
some there's states that you could come
up with like good reasons or bad reasons
to move to
washington is a culture is similar to
vancouver similar weather to vancouver
the place i already live in you know
then there's a lot of stuff to like
in that range for myself okay california
big state lots of you know cool stuff to
see
the weather's pretty good better if you
like hot stuff i guess
if you're in the southern part of the
state say oregon somewhat similar texas
you know texas barbecue
stuff like that it again has a unique
culture that you know is you can
probably only get there
but then there are some states and now
here's where you start to be like please
stop please stop and i refuse
there's some states where you're like i
just can't think of a reason
why you would want to live there or not
want to live there
like they exist in the neutral case like
for example
indiana i don't know anything about
indiana
like i don't i literally i couldn't tell
you a single thing about it
it's i know it's next to illinois and
that's all i got
like i don't know like is there like an
indiana food or something i bet it's
probably like
a pretzel yeah we got indiana pretzels
you put barbecue sauce on them instead
of mustard like it's just
i don't know it doesn't i don't know
anything about it and as a result it's
very hard to rank
name the capital i knew it at one point
because it's just indianapolis right
i was hoping he wouldn't say indiana i'm
sorry
but like
i'm a capital it's just like
it's a state where i just like i don't
know anything maybe maybe that's me not
knowing anything about it
we got good corn here i'm not even
saying it's a bad
place to live it's just very hard to
rank you know it's like ranking
you know like zinc
versus calcium you know i don't even
know what they do like i
if they do have balls state you're not
wrong
i forgot we can't do that
anyway i mean that's all i got
i apologize if you live in indiana but
then
even like now people are like indiana's
famous for corn and i'm like oh shut up
don't try to take iowa's glory corn's an
iowa thing dude you can't have it
indiana's famous for corn yeah but it's
not as famous for corn as iowa is famous
for corn
we're ready we're ready we don't have to
do anything we're just leaving we're
going all path we're safe we're good
this is the corpse we're good
iowa's also famous for slipknot
iowa's potatoes that's idaho man
that's why idaho would be higher up on
my tier list
than iowa because i like i like potatoes
more than corn
and idaho's also right next to
washington
there's some states i would not i think
do well in
i think we don't need to even name them
you probably know what they are
i think there's some states that like
all i can picture if i like lived in
alabama is that you know
people would be saying stuff to me and
be like right and i would be like
i would be torn between agreeing with
them to not create conflict
and thus going back on some of my
principles or
you know having to get into an argument
and
perhaps you know be slandered as a
communist or something like that
you know what i mean
michigan you know i think michigan would
be you know it would be in the top half
i feel like because michigan is a lot
like um
it seems a lot like ontario
and you know mouth don't be mad okay
like i ontario to me just feels like
living
in a saltine
like it's just completely neutral
toronto
i will admit has has some culture
when i think of the rest of ontario i i
and i like it to an extent at least but
i do feel like it's
uh you know hey
you got a real canned center here we got
a real canned center what the heck you
got a real can center we got a real can
center does yours have a future shop a
starbucks
uh and a best buy in it yeah does yours
have a denny's no ours has a montanas
you know
you want to go do karate in the garage
that's michigan as well see that's what
i'm saying that's
and that's why i think i would do okay
in michigan
no no no not three times on the same
attack please
we're safe we're safe look at look at
the damage
you look at the damage you know we're
safe can of corn baby
saved
dude i can't believe we did it so easily
you see how high maintenance he is hey
okay you know what that's not fair cause
like
uh guelph's pretty cool and i mean i
like kingston actually i don't like
ottawa
okay so there's like a few parts of
ontario that i
i would take that back we got a zazel's
stump
slash marker azazel's
a zazel stump



people are saying we should do the pika
challenge i can't keep that up
they say pika is very funny i don't know
what it does but i know that pica
is um the condition where you feel like
you sh you want to eat things that are
not good to eat
so i'm assuming maybe like
every room we complete we eat a trinket
or something
no um
when you get hit maybe you consume a
trinket
bro when you get hit you consume all
trinkets
okay now we're talking hold on you
should not do this
but i'm doing it um
no you come on man you can't ring worm
come on and i'll just take it seriously
for two
dude take it seriously for two seconds
please come on dude
i am taking it seriously i'm seriously
gonna win
easily because ringworm is actually a
huge buff
look at how look at the distance that my
shots travel
how how could this be bad i'm not bad
i'm just drawn that way jessica rabbit
who framed roger rabbit 1991.
i thought apple of sodom made it so that
we couldn't pick up consumables and
instead we got spiders
swallow ringworm and also check this out
look at that
one sub guaranteed
with full health red flies become uh
red hearts become flies okay
got it apparently it's from i apologize
apparently
who framed roger rabbit is from um
1988 not 1991 i apologize
many people are asking me did you use
your vcr
to freeze frame jessica rabbit no
the last time not to say anything of the
first time
the last time that i uh watched
who framed roger rabbit i was still too
young to be horny
now on the x2 dvd
did i use scene select to watch the
scene where mystique
comes into wolverine's tent and then she
tries to seduce him and then
she's like i can be whatever you want
and then she becomes like lady
deathstrike and then she becomes
jean grey maybe i rewound that one a
couple of times
that's that's more contemporary for me
but jessica rabbit no not so much
bop if you know then you know
an honest man oh dude shot speed up just
honestly i got respect for that one dude
i mean how could you not right
how could you not
streamers who are down bad
no still like a little young uh for for
the lola bunny
stuff as well i think that's more of
like a zoomer thing
or maybe like if you're like oh no wait
the opposite i'm like
more of a gen x thing
or also a zoomer thing i think now that
i think about it
yeah come on cg only around these parts
hand drawn i don't think so man what do
you take me for
i'm a zoomer what the heck is lola bunny
it's what happens when capitalism meets
horniness you know as a zoomer you
should be well aware of the
context surrounding this
i'm one year younger than you and i saw
space jam in theaters
and lola bunny was chef's kiss
okay so you were born in 1989 you saw
space jam in theaters space jam came out
in 1995.
you were six years old maximum at the
movie theater you were getting horned up
for lola bunny i don't believe it
i don't believe you
i it doesn't handle the the simple back
of the napkin
mathematics
anybody born in 1988 or 1989
did not hit puberty until the first time
they saw the hit me baby one more time
music video
it's science
i lived through it i i have the battle
scars
my god he's right
the more rooms you do the more items you
get absolutely
you know what i didn't know though until
i was in college like
you know girls have these conversations
maybe like behind closed doors in high
school
in college you get a couple of apple
teenies in you and people start losing
their inhibitions
i didn't know how many uh people out
there were horny for the fox robin hood
the disney robin hood fox from like 1992
or whatever
i had no idea that that was like a thing
that
i mean i don't know if i'd say it's like
a universal crush or whatever but
multiple people were like i know that
fox made me feel weird things and i was
like
you're making me feel weird things right
now
like i thought i knew these people i i
thought you know we've broken bread
together now you're talking about being
horned up from a children's movie in
1992 like
i i have to admit i wish i did not take
ringworm
i've made a mistake
that's from the 60s what
it's from 1973
that's crazy i thought it came out in
the 90s why am i being pink don't worry
about apollo we're just saying
how much i love among us and love to
watch you play among us
on wednesday
blessed penny is pretty sick
you know what now now that you put it
that way and you say
look at how far your shots are traveling
you're not
wrong now that i think about how far my
shots travel it's uh
i feel a lot better about this run
no what we were talking about is how uh
i didn't realize until college and i
started hearing it from people
how many people had a crush on the fox
from the robin hood movie
i i didn't mention your name at all for
the record
chad just picked that one up themselves
hey hit me hit me hit me hit me hit me
please
hit me
i'm telling you dude i bet if you
googled it like you would find like a
community around it
i i would personally guarantee it
he's right i googled it and the first
result was why everyone has a crush on
disney's robin hood
i'm telling you dude i don't just make
this stuff up
no i i said they had a crush on the
robin hood not that they wanted to be
the robin hood it's two different
communities
okay i think we do want the spirit heart
here
gotta just prepare ourselves
good to go anyway that's all i got
same community i don't know man i don't
know me
i think it's one of those things you
know that all rectangles are
all squares are rectangles not our all
rectangles or squares
have you ever had a dream that you
wanted to dream
you wanted to dream it so bad you could
dream anything
i held our i can't do it it's too much
it's even for me that's too much
hit me please thank you
i mean come on that was that was insane
that was that was my one mercy restart
i don't even know what these are man the
twins i'm seeing double four trinkets
ice cubes stay frosty
please hit me you freeze some enemies
that seems pretty swell
look at that we got we got two brother
bobbies too
what's the story behind that video
because that's another great video but i
would you know without context you never
know what you're getting into there
right
the one that's like you ever have a
dream that
you dreamed that you wanted him to dream
you so bad you could dream anything
i always thought that it was like an
edited video but
apparently it's it's real
take whipworm absolutely not i refuse
maybe we'll see i don't know i'm
thinking about it
it's a wonderful video
the canucks return got delayed again
honestly good
i was very proud of jt miller for like
i mean i hate to say it like it sounds
rude to him but i was very proud of jt
miller for
uh using common sense and speaking his
mind when he was like hey like
half of our team had covered why are we
expected to get ready to play a game for
friday
and everyone was like wait a minute you
can just say that you can just like go
in an interview
and and say the truth
i didn't know nope not today not today
yeah like we're gonna miss the playoffs
anyway like the least you could do is
just
let them at least recuperate from
kovid before they get the crap beat out
of them by like toronto and edmonton and
winnipeg
anyway that's my hockey discussion now
we're talking this is now this is an
item
get some hp head down to the next floor
can a corner and i'll be all right
can of corn and i'll be all right no no
no no no
why are you taking damage i'm realizing
now that
um oh now i get it i'm realizing now um
why this run is so confusing fine i'll
take it
for some people um i
am covering up my trinkets but every
time i get hit i suck up my trinkets
so i'm getting hit to deliberately suck
up my trinkets um
okay now this is pog
do the streams go by too fast
repentance streams go by too fast
i can't believe there's only like an
hour and 45 minutes left
it's i'm not being facetious either like
my the last two or three weeks of
streaming have gone
have gone by so quickly
i now finally after 12 years understand
why the average person on this website
streams until they end up with like
medically low blood sugar and has to go
to the hospital
i used to think that i was just built
different i i'm just i'm
finally playing like the first video
game i guess i actually enjoy
for the first time ever man 24-hour
stream-a-thon
no those days are are behind me
so that's a name i've not heard in a
long time we we leave that now for the
people who were born
in 1996 and later
more power to you i'm on a new wave now
best of luck to you
yes three hours is like i here's what
i'm gonna say okay
i have long been a proponent of the idea
that streaming burns a lot of calories
and i realized like after well two
different things one is once i started
eating lunch
uh i got a lot less hungry which
probably is not too surprising
and then the secondary thing is um
that it takes less calories to solo
stream than it does to do the nlss
it's i don't think it's that streaming
takes a lot of calories i think it's
just like arguing
and joking takes a lot of calories
i did a read the other day that
apparently like
your brain represents two to three
percent of your overall mass
for most people but it takes up
20 of the energy expenditure or it
represents 20
of your energy expenditure which is
pretty amazing to think of
and you know with streaming you're
really using
why not like nothing but your brain
does this seem fair to you now you're
talking
two percent of the human body uses 30
of the calories and the brain
is in control of what we eat does this
seem fair to you
the fingernails must receive some
recompense from the brain
i'm losing the bernie impression the
more i get the
the angry man on the new york sidewalk
the closer i get to that the further
away i get from from bernie
you have no respect for the
thermodynamics that represent the
foundation
of metabolism you don't understand
metabolic effects
heavy pog
heavy pot not heavy pog not confirmed
not heavy pog
um i'm gonna be stupid let's do this
yum yum sunny d and rum yum yum
i think i'll go and get me some
i'm thinking about my door stop when
you're gonna ring it when you're gonna
ring it
how much money would it take for you to
do a
um a 30-day subathon
the number probably exists but it's not
on my radar right now
but honestly like i i'm not saying i was
early to the party but you can hear for
like
from two months ago when i was talking
about watching some other streamers on
twitch
and i you know i don't name names but
like sometimes i'm like i watched a
streamer that had a lot of viewers and i
was like i don't really get it
but i was very open about the fact that
i i watched
ludwig stream for the first time maybe
two or three months ago and i was like i
totally understand why uh
why this guy is popular i understand why
people watch him he's a
he's a very high energy entertaining
streamer you can tell he puts a lot of
effort into his content as well
i totally get it
kind of like you well it's like me back
in the day where you know
occasionally i go off on a wave and be a
little bit you know like like
very high energy very acetylcholine
driven
then we went through some time where we
were like dopamine driven
um i think now like honestly is we got a
little serotonin energy going on which
is totally fine i think it's like a
natural uh
evolution you know i think i'm a little
like sleepier now and it's uh
you know we just you just roll with the
punches on that one
yeah i'm more of like a put you in the
couch sort of streamer now instead of
like a heady high
ready for the dmt arc oh now we're
talking i i will say i was walking
around yesterday and there was a
a brilliant piece of graffiti i saw that
said free dmt
and i was just like i didn't even know
they were locked up man
i'm way behind at times
what the heck is that we gotta come back
for these
will push you up against the wall kind
of streamer you really think i won't
push you up against the couch
indiana jones and the tail of the
crystal key

not like a drug guy to begin with except
for

like apart from that
uh and um crocodile okay but apart from
those
three you're you're never gonna catch me
on psychedelics man
who do you think i am john mcafee
what the sure i'll take it but give me a
second here
have you heard my takes man i'm already
like so far out there
i'm like whoa dude you ever just think
of like making a budget and then
investing all of your supplemental
income into a broad base in the
index fund that tracks the entire global
marketplace
like dude a lot of people aren't ready
for the stuff i say when i'm sober
like i'm not sure if i could afford to
get any more any any crazier dude
should've just gone into the fire
hmm
shut up grandpa i'm in coinbase
i need to find a way to get hit give me
a moment here
tinted rock in order to pick up the
trinket you should be forced to answer
what it does in a multiple choice format
well um that'll be the last
something's wrong trinket we take then
from this point onwards
this is a fun challenge though like i i
get it i am hip i'm with it
i will say there's like you know six or
seven amazing
trinkets and we haven't seen too many of
them so far but still
in 2013
i was convinced that you were high all
the time i'm gonna give you a little
secret and it
you know it's like a i'm i'm not i guess
it's not a self-report because i'm
reporting you
but um people who
consume a lot of marijuana
are always convinced that everybody
that they enjoy is
also partaking all the time i don't know
why the phenomenon is true
but like people who smoke a lot of weed
are always like this guy
smokes weed and i'm like i really like
you know no like i got nothing against
it but i'm just like this is just how i
talk man
this is my personality like off drugs
called out i'm just saying
but as a street i don't even know what
this does do but we're definitely taking
it
it's a broken re-roll your dest
yeah right dude right yeah
chib oh yeah dude definitely i mean do
you hear chibi has six peyronies
the guy's crazy don't take it too late
man too late
too late too late look at that it's too
late
it's already been gotten
as a streamer though you get accused of
doing like every drug
if you come into a stream and you have
high energy or you happen to like sniff
because you have allergies people are
like coke nose
and you're like what are you talking
about man you're like
just i'm just trying to play like you
know mario kart without being like
harassed or something like that
this guy loves ibuprofen
i was losing it like um i didn't realize
like what percentage of
i guess planet earth has done those
drugs
[Laughter]
but like people you know like six months
ago they would post
um you know like an interview that
donald trump jr did on
you know fox news or whatever and
everyone would be like look at the way
he's
look at the way he's like biting his
lips i remember that and i'm like i
don't know maybe but like
i didn't i had no idea that this is
everybody's like so aware of what all
the symptoms of
of narcotic use are i must be naive dude
i got like
no clue at all
i'm just like man this guy sure is
talking really fast
he's talking a lot faster than i do
you see the post nasal drip you do you
see him he's horking up a lung there
yo that okay that's very useful thank
you
i had no idea
dude it preserves your eternal heart
that's pretty sick what
okay laos the last in the isaactorium
hp please right can't get items
all right about that
i have no idea what's happening i'm an
er doctor so i hope i can recognize it
okay but you notwithstanding i'm just
like
i will say i was i mean maybe this
speaks to my naivete
but it was also like a little earlier um
in
the internet's lifespan where which is
where i assume most people learn about
this stuff
uh we went to a party in university and
then
some guy that i had never met before was
like hey we're gonna go
do yayo in the bathroom do you want in
and i said
nah i'm good and at the time
i didn't even know what it was
i had to look it up later and be like
that guy was trying to it was like tony
montana
i don't know what he was trying to do
there
it is it's a rimworld drug but it's a
it's slang for uh
for a real drug okay so we don't have
mom's box anymore
we have book of the dead
i'm assuming that happened because of gb
bug
but i don't know if that's like a bad
thing i don't know i still feel like
pretty good here
didn't you know what yayo was because of
gta 3. bro i didn't play that much gta 3
okay i played a lot of vice city
keepers bargain i don't see what could
go wrong there
i meant vice city gta 3 was all crank
i mean i played a lot of vice city that
uh i'll
i'll admit that's a great i mean that's
probably why i like 1980s music so much
oh we have a new space bar item again
that's probably why i still have a soft
spot for the song i ran
by flock of seagulls what am i doing
didn't you know what it was because of
tony yayo bro you're actually like oh
every time we use our spacebar item it
changes
you're actually blowing my mind every
time we take damage it changes every
time we do anything it changes
um i only now realize that tony yayo is
named after
cocaine i thought that was just the
man's name
swear on my life swear on my life i
thought that was his name
his name is marvin i see why he changed
it for a little bit of street cred but
that'd be a good bit for uh for a band
right
what if you were the band that all i'm
tony yo yeah and i'm johnny beer
welcome to where g
unit i'm tim coffee
that's a good trinket okay so i don't
know i
have no idea what's going on on this run
um we're just letting it
we're just letting it fly
bill tylenol dj bill tylenol
that's all i got i mean we could keep it
going forever but
when are we getting some dj funk in here
i mean chib is like
the this you ever hear the expression is
better to burn out than fade away
i take the opposite position but i
understand the appeal when i watch
chib stream
like i i don't think you can maintain
that kind of uh
look between the rooms i don't think you
can keep those kind of uh
you know habits going on stream without
getting the mcat at some point
but uh the the the sheer
fervor carries
it makes for compelling viewing every
single time
yeah that's it that is what i said you
don't have to be open for 12 hours every
day when you run a michelin star
restaurant
a lot of streamers are
you know they gotta stream 12 hours a
day because they you know
might take until hour 11 before they
make their first joke chib on the other
hand it's like
ev every course is a winner
straight gas 24 7. what's up with that
rock in the item room
it's a little golden
it's gold it's one
like i'll just tell you straight up yo
that was sick
um basically they're tinted rocks that
are bad
they drop a little coinage
that's about it occasionally like a lot
of coinage but usually just like a
little coinage what the
okay hold on this is amazing great item
pretty good it's very solid hold that
don't take that take that
yeah pretty good all right solid
pretty good
that seems like a good one to hold dude
your range is so high right now you're
definitely
like on drugs look at how high your
range is
every time we use our space bar we get a
new space bar
first episode of queen's gambit be like
good one actually i get i understood
that reference i was still paying
attention to the show in episode one
i have gulped my trinkets
help me i'm trapped help me get away
from myself
what does electrified key do i have oh
it gives you a full charge i thought you
meant the trinket that was a cool
looking key and the answer is i got no
idea
i'm just i'm just hoping they'll give me
mom's knife and let me escape
i appear to be stuck with the breath of
life
maybe when we go down to the next floor
it'll it'll
alter the terms of the deal because this
is not a very good uh
item for us to have or for anybody to
have because it's bad
it's just unaffected by m
what's m
hold it all the way to the bottom um oh
you know what you're a genius look at
this
what the
this incredible intel help me
we do a little trolling no that wasn't
trolling though that was good
what happened to this run why why run
used to be good now bad
because you spent all your money i do
have money equals power that's true
i consider myself like i'm kind of like
a rock in the ocean
like i'm unaffected by the turbidity of
the waves but there are some times where
i'll like
you know be like man it sure is kind of
like wavy out here you know what i mean
like the zayn i you know i'm for it oh
that's pretty good
but oh no
but on the other hand i'm also like you
know it sure do be a little wavy out
out there boy it's true wavy today
oh a ship yeah oh hey look at that
there's a champagne
now we're talking
now we're talking what is up with this
room
why is why is this room framed like it
was
made by a24
okay i'm gonna place a bomb down here
and blow you up
and then i'm going to do the same thing
good joke thank you i know i do it i
know the zoomers they love the a24 baby
who does i mean they make good movies
they they have a certain
you know idiosyncratic element to them
of course but
they make good movies
i have no idea what you're talking about
yeah dude a24 come on
nar 240
yeah they distributed knives out uncut
gems hereditary
mid-summer etc
i will not jump yet now i will jump
i might as well hold it i don't know
maybe we're gonna win
i don't know we do have like uh
essentially zero hp
this is we're only 23 minutes in
i actually thought we were like 45
minutes into this run
no mention of moonlight it's because
i've not seen moonlight yet
i only watch uh best picture winners
wait it did win best picture right
it did okay um
hold on we're not we're not stuck yet
okay we're not stuck
because here's what we can do okay
you can use that and get a better item
you use this
you can use this
just give it a sec as long as we get
endlessly recharging items just give it
just give it a second man
doctor's remote oh no
saved saved look at that undefeated
technology
it is a little resinous i'll admit but
i'm i'm glad they put a little out in
there
i appreciate it
plus like it's one of those situations
where i'm like i think if we held r
it would actually make our life easier
so
i think that if anything people can very
much understand where i'm coming from on
this one
pop fit
extremely good dude no joke we're going
to win this run i i'm
surprised i'm as surprised as anybody
else but
i think now we are going to win what the
heck dude what is this blue key and why
is it stinky
i've never seen the cartridge work this
well
all that for a drop of blood now you're
gonna lose
wrong highly wrong excuse me i thought
you were dead you were behind an item i
thought you were dead
now i have smelted my trinkets you enter
doors
for free however you have to go through
hush rooms
how many times have we gotten filigree
feather dude
you see the dodging though i mean come
on if we're talking about classics
do my name get brought up does my name
get brought up
thank you for the money dude we must
have like a damage multiplier on top of
money equals power like that's
that's pretty sick
full health well worth it the
hyrule fans
that's not how you walk okay i'm losing
some focus i think i'm at zero spark
mouth right now
that's my problem i've also been leaning
forward in the gamer hunch
for hours now
there you go pull your back back into
the chair move your
move your microphone back towards your
mouth
i was all shrimped up
chad you want to play movie trivia name
that movie
i will see you in another life when we
are both cats
you don't want to play movie trivia okay
forget that i said that
forget i said that it's not from the
movie cats but i could see why you would
be confused
it's not from dogs either is is also not
from cats and dogs or robin hood or
knives out or terminator or falling down
starring michael douglas or the burbs or
the machinist
pierre day i see that you have said
vanilla sky pierre day congratulations
you've just won
the first inaugural episode of movie
trivia it was indeed
the movie called vanilla sky
remake of the spanish film abra los ojos
starring tom cruise penelope cruz jason
cruz
soundtrack done by radio crews directed
by cameron cruz
ted cruz yeah ted cruz is in it
dude these don't even get me started on
these red rooms these these red rooms
are like
not they're not good they're just not
good
they don't respect the silence that
serves as the foundation of creativity
plus two movie trivia bit is a good
thing dude that's the first time i've
ever seen plus two i'm very familiar
with minus two
minus two is when you make a bad joke
right
did you know according to twitch stats
you're actually the
20th ranked streamer for most number of
games streamed in 2021.
dude i gotta be honest with you
considering the amount of streamers out
i know i've jokingly called myself
number one
20th is pretty good especially
considering i've i've been maining isaac
for a couple of weeks here
that's that's quite high on the list i
would say
i'm proud of myself
i had to remind myself like i mean
whatever you want to stream you want to
stream right like
it is what it is um but i was like man
i've been streaming a lot of repentance
lately then i looked at like my
spreadsheet and i'm like i'm pretty sure
even in the throes of repentance mania
i've still been streaming a greater
variety than like the average
variety streamer
it's trended down for a couple of weeks
don't get me wrong but
i'm like i've you know we played a lot
of overcooked last week played some
pac-man
i'm just trying to get you to step on
the creep please
and not once have we touched among us uh
recently or grand theft auto
role-playing this is it's all holistic
all right music by the way isaac
please please pop out
at least we landed some creep there like
like this is miserable dude
why is this so slow
you know damage is not amazing but it's
not that bad
i guess our rate of fire we have taken a
tears down pill
you got no damage you're flat oh my god
mom's knife please
that's pretty good that's still pretty
good who needs hp
man i've never heard this song loop
before
yeah more like money doesn't equal power
got him i mean we our damage gets really
good the more money we get
like i think it's even better than uh
than the average
you're supposed to get like 0.04 percent
i think we get 0.05
it's a 25 increase that's pretty good
man
we also have two rotten babies hey man
how about that
can of corn and all that can of corn
yeah that's the problem i think we've
got non-fungible tears
if they could simply be funged
everything would be okay
you should fund those tears that's the
problem i can't once they're
non-fungible they can't be fudged this
game doesn't have right click save image
as
if they ever added it though like oh man
hold
gonna play canasta with your grandma
then i'll make the whole blockchain my
my slave i'll make the whole blockchain
my safe
incredible incredible chain reaction

4-0 ball game i don't know if i'll ever
put on this headset again

yeah dude don't even get me started
because like now you're reminding me of
those companies that like named the star
after you
dude are you telling me that was a scam
the whole time
because i'm straight up there were like
two years in a row where my grandma
named a star after me
i'm gonna be real cheesed off if if any
of you guys own like you know
lewinthal epsilon seven because i was
told that that was gonna be named
ryan what on earth have i oh my god i'm

joke i don't understand
what's wait dude or hold on

without looking at the screen
no problem wouldn't be the first time
appreciate it appreciate it
appreciate it appreciate it
it looks normal to me not
all those who wander are lost you ever
consider that
nope me neither
live laugh love how about that can of
corn
number magnet
you missed a dime back there i'll go
back for it but
it must be top of the line if it's a
dime that's not top of the line
i'm not that interested oh it's
literally
right there hey man that's not a dime by
the way
that you feel silly
or is it bet you feel silly
you use the bomb when you have 26 keys
you know
you may be right i may be crazy
but i might just be the live streamer
you're looking for
what the heck
i'm here to weigh in on the sparkling
water debate put some respect on topo
chico's name i would be happy to put
some respect on topo chico's name
if they would make their way to canada
i'm not like trying to put them on blast
i bet it's one of those things where
like you know things that are approved
for
i know how this sounds but like things
that are you know
approved for consumption in america they
got to go through a different set of
hoops in canada
but uh you know i'm sure it's a
a lot of work for a relatively small
market but
i i oftentimes find myself unable to
relate
as a result of the fact that we don't
get all of those cool american or
european food products on the regular
we do seem to have a pretty high overlap
in particular with the united
kingdom a lot of foods that i thought
were um
this is pretty sick a lot of foods that
i thought were canadian turn out to
actually
be british in in origin
uh we should not be giving you uh
money
in australia we got nothing hey come on
man
what would hungry jacks say if they
heard you just call them nothing
yo i was looking into jollibee yesterday
do you know that jollibee
owns every uh
food company on earth they own the
philippine version
of every single food chain you can think
of
and by that i mean burger king they also
own um an american fast food chain
called
smash burger i had no idea apparently
it's got 350 locations it started in
denver colorado i also because this is
my first time ever
hearing about smash burger uh
did you know they have the absolute
worst logo
in human history
it's actually i think it's literally
just the gamestop
logo it's just like but like but nothing
like it unchanged
it's just like white smash red burger
that's it
no i've never been to a smash burger
they haven't made it up here
they don't respect the silence that
services the foundation of creativity
the fool
as a kid i got baited by smash burger
and i thought it was a game stop
dude really
i'm missing out i've had them overrated
i trust malpha on this mouth he's got a
very
like he's got a burger palette he knows
what he likes and i trust him
mind you they'll probably never make
their way over here anyway
no i have i have as of yet i have still
not been to jollibee
i have to have to wait for them to open
and preferably not at the corner of
granville and robson but
we could just take a peek i guess oh man
this is what i mean i've never seen this
room be anything other than garbage even
though i read that it can be something
other than garbage
i didn't know jollibee also owns the
coffee bean
and tea leaf that was news to me
really yeah man i mean i don't know if
they own a hundred percent but they
they are the
major major major shareholder for sure i
looked it up on wikipedia yesterday
thanks doorstop
really appreciate it
saved
don't press the space bar man don't
press the space bar
dude we got some serious damages with
these rotten babies dude
what okay so brimstone bombs are
probably
really good but i don't want to mess
with our money right now
i think instead let's just get little
delirium for
literally no reason whatsoever and dude
this is our final floor
let's go
don't put me in an error room or do it
it'll be funny
it's the boss fight dude we're gonna win
i told you it's so easy
easy game take that how's this for smash
burger
taner to zazel if you win can of corn
maybe can of corn
if i win
i mean we haven't played tinted as hazel
yet and we unlocked him like four days
ago i think
i think i owe you attempted azel run
look i got nothing against smash burger
okay i reserve
i reserved my negativity for bubbly
also many people have asked about the
can of corn meme
i have no idea what it's from i just
know that it's from
mouth i'm pretty sure it's from a tv
show
i'm gonna guess the simpsons
it's from the longest yard
adam sandler made this joke it's from
the longest yard i got the fries that'll
cross your eyes
mouth does love adam sandler he won't
stop talking about him
every once in a while i drive past the
um
the house well the apartment complex
that happy gilmore lived in
in the movie happy gilmore because it
was filmed in vancouver and i think
you know next time i go by i'll take a
photo that could be a viral tweet
i'll take a selfie of me and the baby in
front of the apartment complex
and then i'll tweet it with the selfie
and then right next to that i'll put a
picture
from the movie as well and i'll be like
making my
i'm gonna put something like making my
daily pilgrim
making my yearly pilgrimage to the
apartment complex
that happy gilmore lived at in the movie
happy gilmore
open parentheses 1995. okay um
slash marker completed
pika run



it was kind of easy honestly
you know what i'm feeling good let's
mainline some other challenges here
while we got them you know
like what a we've unlocked all of them i
think here what about
uh baptism by fire
where bethany maggie's faith hp
i'm trying to figure out like
how we do anything you press the
spacebar and then you get
this cool little orb you shoot out
okay this thing charges up with
enemy souls
i believe it seems to be correct it
consumes souls okay
and then i'm i know i said orb when i
said orb i didn't mean orb what i meant
was
jar which is also called an urn which is
similar to an orb
and we're going to run out of ammo but
we can use
guppy's paw to generate some more ammo
all right dope but that was pretty smart
though
in the whole scheme of things okay
are there item rooms i don't know let's
i don't think there's item rooms on like
any challenge
but
no item rooms confirmed okay let's leave
then
let's leave where do we have to go to
isaac
which is the cathedral no proud dude
easy easy
donkey oh we get i forgot we get hp
every floor no problem there
why didn't you take the hp um
because i don't need it it's definitely
not that i
just forgot
it was it was actually like
in many ways i've heard that this
challenge is
too uh easy so i just thought i would
make it more fair on the game
yeah i have maggie's faith right now
it's just uh it's blocked by the camera
i apologize
okay we can't spam too much here
you're toasted brother
you're you're toasted thank you thank
you for continuing to be toasted
i can't believe we only got two spirits
from that guy
new siege video may need a small title
update
thank you macros but can can we
acquiesce what the problem is with the
the title i'm realizing now is it called
i
shouldn't be alive but it doesn't have
the
maybe the game name in it
i don't have a charge that's that's
completely correct
okay thank you i will uh
it's called it's called i shouldn't be
alive siege
three at least as far as error goes
like or errors go it's not that bad
it is the third siege
episode so it that can wait until
a more that can wait until i don't need
to slash marker it out i think
people will figure it out plus nobody
watches the siege videos anyway
except for sloane martin
john okay um
blast them i'd like to keep my eternal
oh okay
blast him
not dude we're gonna get spun too don't
do the voice man it's scary dude we're
so close to
becoming freaking guppy dude yeah
absolutely
give me this in fact i'm i'm like maybe
this is better than guppy's pod
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no
no no no you gotta you gotta keep that
you absolutely at this
will just kill us dead
guppy would allow you to fly and do
nothing else
oh well nevertheless
kind of an expensive way to get flying
but you know on the other hand
maybe it's worth it look at this right
right off the bat
these these flies are gonna generate
more than they nope
never mind
beautiful that hurts
bro i'm trying not to spam
we gotta if possible we need to kill
more than one enemy
with the same fire and that's gonna keep
us rolling here
is mighty spicy spam or him
i mean you've heard me say it before i'm
a firm believer
we definitely can't take that i'm a firm
believer that spam is actually pretty
tasty
we're waiting for the right moment
he's actually a genius but also somehow
we're out of it we're not out of ammo
i'm spamming
not good for you but spam is very tasty
nonetheless i'm out of ammo
i have six ammo i also will admit i've
never had spam
like straight out of the can
i feel like there's almost no reason to
do it if you have access to heat
if you if you don't have access to
something that can like
you know create heats then
i i mean you got to do what you got to
do
but i'm here to tell you fried spam
delicious
i would never just eat it straight out
of the can am i am i losing my mind why
am i
somehow i'm the greatest gamer of all
time
and yet i'm i'm losing ammo
justin get out of my chat okay i'm mad
at you
why i'm doing your voice now because you
tweeted
that you did a 390
pound deadlift on like you're within
your first couple of weeks at the gym
that's crazy like that's insane
this might ruin our run but that it'll
be fun i can't take it
like i'm pretty sure when i was working
out like the the highest deadlift i got
to
despite dead lifting you know one to
three times a week for
the better part of a year was like
maybe like 270 or something like that
maybe 280.
my deadlift was kind of embarrassing i'm
willing to admit but
it was it might have been higher than
that it was lower than my squat though
well time to die probably but let's
let's try it
probably needed to sumo it too i was
doing sumo because i don't have
that kind of flexibility
plus my freaking toes broken
what the heck is this telescope lens
i walked into the spikes i'm a fool
oh okay so can i tell you something i'm
an idiot you know how you said ammo was
in the top left
i heard all that or whatever but i
really just looked at my spirit heart
counter
and thought that that was how we
generated charges for it
you guys can't gas me up this much i'm
gonna float away on ego
i told you justin i'm mad i'm not i mean
i'm happy for you but i am upset
as well so don't don't be too excited
because i'm
honestly pretty pissed off
not really though like i have a good
reason to be
he's done it incredible 20 is like max
ammo i'm assuming
yeah yeah okay
did i miss team out you you did miss
team out but uh
but you're here for um
whatever this challenge is called
baptism by fire you're here for baptism
by fire
having a pretty good time with that
i mean honestly and chad will back me up
on this
i tried to lose
team els i did everything in my power to
to try to create a loss from it it just
wouldn't happen
everything i picked up to ruin the run
just made it stronger
oh sick dude range upgrade uh said
nobody ever
anyway
oh man spark mouth delicious you gotta
love it
yeah i think that's a great idea the
idea of doing like t-melt streaks
i'm never gonna get that like 900 oh
eden streak or anything
i don't know maybe i could with enough
with enough focus but
it's not it's not built into my
personality to do it
but like to try to get as many team out
wins in a row like if you could win
five team eld runs in a row i think you
might be the god of isaac improv
i hate to ruin a joke for that that's
gonna be in a youtube video but this
one's this one's for the streamers okay
this one's for the 596.
when i was talking in the isaac video
today about how bubbly
has never gone into my mentions but
instead they're in the mentions of
uh hank green uh i i made a joke
off the cuff that made me so proud of
myself that i'm gonna repeat it okay
this is back when i thought he wrote
the fault in our stars i said hey i'm
sorry i didn't write the
the or i didn't make the fault in our
stars
all i made was the fart in our stalls
and then i laughed and i laughed and i
laughed
i i said
uh pretty good right
it's a good joke you shouldn't have
explained the punchline
well i had to because it was about a
book so i was worried that chat wouldn't
get it
but um
now that's a joke i learned that's a
that's a mouth style roast
so true so true bestie
okay i'm really it's just all about ammo
ammo has never been a problem for me in
shooting games it's mostly the shooting
that's been an issue
that being said i'm realizing now we
actually are facing oblivion
because i only have three ammo but maybe
it'll be a boss who spawns
other enemies it's not
that's fine we swap and then just we
don't get hit
dude i don't think i've seen the
adversary in this game yet
okay thank god you died right there
because i didn't have anything else
[Laughter]
uh that could have been a disaster
red green if the ladies don't find you
handsome they should at least find you
handy how about that
your mouth
mouth you gotta admit when you say like
i have a headache i can't stream and
then you watch my stream
it calls things into question a little
bit because like
i i feel like my stream is the kind of
energy that would make
a headache worse
i didn't say i have a headache i already
ordered a pizza
you think about everything don't you
saved 16 ammo
can't forget the bev yes sir now if
we're not drinking bubbly anymore by the
way we're drinking spark mouth i don't
know if you got the memo
uh zetta hero hero
nissa thank you for the gifted subs
thank you
i ruined my voice yelling steve madden
steve madden
steve bannon steve madden steve madden
steve madden
um dude i'm gonna do it whatever this
could be fun right
i don't know what it did
i can still shoot i just gotta i gotta
pull the thing out you know i keep the
mfn thing on me
oh there goes my eternal heart that's uh
oh this so it's all good
can of corn
oh what the he's stronger than i
expected i'm you but stronger
i left for five minutes and he's
whispering steve madden excuse me that's
not a whisper that's
cool guy voice there's a a stark
difference
a whisper is like steve madden
cool guy boys steve madden keep manning
okay ammo ammo is a real concern
saved saved we got two souls out of that
we don't need tinted skull dude because
we're not doing
like all uh the true ending stuff we're
just trying to live our lives
hey
little ammo little ammo you love to see
it
you love to see it
still like it leave come back
uh second secret room
look at that he's a genius all right for
ammo versus mom
but mom creates
enemies red mom might not
dude an orbital would help out an awful
lot here
no don't even shoot don't even shoot
red enemy please enemies
enemy no enemy okay
that's a conundrum can i get her to step
on her own hand it does not work
okay we're just gonna have to blast her
next time we see a door open
we're blasting
we're screwed we're gonna die
i'm going out on my own terms
[Laughter]
it had to be done all right restar me
there was there was no other way out of
that
i think do we really start oh no we we
shoot our spirit arts to start with
right
yeah yeah we got some momentum okay that
was not that was not the right way to
play that
lesson learned
name of jeff annie jeff gordon baby
best nascar driver of all time probably
i don't know i don't watch nascar
good answer thank you love nascar number
46
bro you're gonna make me guppies head
you guppies pay you
he's top five who's the
jimmy johnson's the best nascar driver
of all time
he's got an orbital
dick trickle it's a dick trickle is a
all-time great sports name no question
about it
no oh we broke his tier
no football name can compete with dick
trickle
dude i'm gonna get real freaking spicy
with this okay get rid of guppy's paw
to take bob's rod and head once every
two room charge that gives us some souls
i think this might be exactly what the
doctor ordered here
nay don't do it you guys are crazy i'm
gonna do it i'm gonna win
get ready
i don't play by the rules i marched the
beat of my own drummer
i mean the bricoshaw ferguson is it's a
wonderful name it's a great name
now you're thinking outside the bun
okay so we don't want to use our spirit
arts for bob's rotten head
in my opinion just yet we'd rather use
our spirit hearts
pog in order to get us
out of a terrible jam if we get
super stuck
and need some ammo in honor of your team
out victory
that's the vacuum cleaner by the way i i
have
made some scrambled eggs i hope your
scrambled eggs are okay
i hope they're good
uh use please thank you
it sounds like the vacuum cleaner is uh
is upset and trying to get in
maybe it is dude maybe it is
i've been had eggs in a long time man i
was just thinking
when was the last time i had eggs
i'm sure i've had them as an ingredient
in something
on their own i mean the only time i
really get eggs
is in a situation where like i'm at uh
i'm at a place for breakfast and i
haven't been at a place for breakfast in
a long time
uh not sure if you watch the news but
there's a dang cheeto in the white house
so i haven't had the opportunity
recently
so it's been a while man it's genuinely
been a long time
what do you eat for breakfast
this morning i had kanak abroad and
18-month
gouda cheese is that not normal
we have something else that shoots tears
okay that's great stuff
we don't take any devil deals we
shouldn't have even gone in here because
we cost ourselves an angel deal
but that's fine we know for the future i
just love
cheese man
i know like who doesn't i know like join
the club or whatever but
but like for real cheese dude it's
undefeated
that hurts i think we got the formula
for this
i'm not gonna be shy man i've been
eating a lot of manchego lately
how do you like cheese but hate milk
it's pretty simple
the reason is because she's good milk
bad
come on
come on dude
i will say there was one time though i
bought a cheese
and it was called like pacific rock
cheddar or something like that and i was
like man this is like one of the best
cheese
products i've ever had in my entire life
so i was so
enthusiastic about it i actually went
online
to uh google what other people were
talking about
when they talk about this cheese because
i was like of course they're going to be
positive
and like if you ever like go look it up
right now go search pacific rock cheese
and see the terrible things people are
saying about it
tastes like sour milk it tastes like
cheese if cheese was made of sand
like it's the sourest grossest cheese
i've ever had in my entire life like
it it it broke my heart it's how i
realized i didn't have like a cheese
palette at
all i thought i was on the cutting edge
and uh instead i was i i cut myself on
their edge i suppose
oh my god to get nothing out of this is
that's so disappointing you know what
you know what here we go
mission failed heavy mission fail you do
cut the cheese
he's not wrong i've been known to cut
the cheese on occasion
more than on occasion really
dude this run is actually sick now
though thank god missing page two now
it's all coming together
it won gold at the international cheese
awards in 2014
yeah but i don't know isn't that one of
those awards like you can give to
yourself or something
you know like is the internation is the
international cheese awards like a real
thing or is it like
the real ones called like the cheesies
or something like that
jd power award for best cheese three
years running
nothing cuts the cheese like a ram
malf if you had to buy a pickup truck
i've been thinking about getting one
because i'm kind of like a
i'm like a pretty rough and tumble sort
of guy um
what what pickup truck do you think
would most suit me
i've been thinking about getting one of
those ford f-350s with the dualies
seems pretty practical for kind of you
know just puttering around the city just
doing my day-to-day stuff
cyber truck
it's a good choice i guess like i guess
i could just get a cyber truck
i also want one that when you push down
the pedal it goes like
i don't want one that's like i want one
that when you push down the pedal like
people
know man people know you know what i
mean
like can i get the uh the pork chop
express from big trouble in little china
okay thank you stapler i believe i have
my stapler thank you godhead i believe i
have my god head
i don't know if this even affects what
we can do with our
what a wasted series of items on this
run but uh
also the greatest angel deal ever seen
in earth's history
confirmed
hey hey jump over here hey come here hey
come here come here
hey you freaking you loser
is too big for you
imagine if you had diplopia there you
could take both and then one extra man
i'm not trying to taunt you but my team
out run that i just did had the trophy
spawn in the first room
that's pretty cool i mean i'm happy for
you honestly
however you can find a way through team
melt my quarrel is not with you
i had a great time playing team elt
and if anything i uh
i feel like you've been deprived of the
opportunity to to learn how it works
you know so i uh
if anything i just feel bad for you
i could go for a team out right now oh
man i could go
could go for a tuna melt right now yeah
tuna melt and i'll be all right
you know what he's done it
dude tainted forgotten so much fun
you're absolutely right no lie detected
i'm going to hit you with one of those
first
hey get away from me
frickbloat.com.org
you're toasted you're toasted
i got a one-room charge krampus head
don't let the developers know
it'll be patched out by 1 46 p.m pacific
time
tuna is worst tasting fish change my
mind bro
come on come on that can't possibly be
true
first off what kind of tuner are we
talking about
canned tuna not that good
but suffice is in a pinch
fresh tuna though is is unbelievably
delicious
it's one of the best tunas it's sorry
it's one of the best fishes
it is the best tuna chicken of the sea
what do you mean it tastes like water
that's not tuna you're drinking water
man that's two different things tuna's a
fish
water is what fish live in it's like if
i called you
like a house you'd probably be offended
doesn't make any sense
i mean canned tuna is not particularly
good
please walk into this so i can get a
free soul a soul for a soul
thank you but like it's it's
probably not my favorite fish
but high quality tuna is a high quality
choice
you get death i get a free soul exactly
trade offer
what is your favorite fish then i gotta
be honest
i really like a halibut for sure
i also have to be honest i very much
enjoy
barramundi
a delicious tasting sustainable and
economical um oh you screwed me
go ahead stephen get him are you ready
stephen
start shooting
look at this farming dude orbital never
heard of them
barramundi's good the way i understand
fish barramundi is the same species as
chilean sea bass but instead of being
endangered
it's actually like it's like we're in
danger of having too many of them
so if anything you should feel bad about
not eating them i think
but you might want to check that first
before you go around spouting it as
common knowledge because
i might be mistaken
they're taking over yeah bio major how i
can't be wrong
i majored in it i'm a fish guy
man i like fish like pretty much all
fish
there's some that i'm not like an
enormous fan of like i don't see what
all the fuss is about when it comes to
like arctic char
like just chill out man it's not like
shut up about it for like two seconds
it's not that impressive
there we go i was just waiting for that
love love some salmon especially of the
smoked variety

seen it it's so funny uh it says it was
uploaded at 6am this morning and it has
one view
i would also say the thing about herring
it makes a great appetizer in a group
setting
because at least in north america i
would say if you took a random sampling
of 10 people
get him stephen get him stephen
uh about 70 to 80
percent of them will not
eat pickled fish they will find it uh
disgusting so you order the pickled
herring you go do you mind if i choose
an appetizer
then you pick the pickled herring and
then you get it all for yourself man
little little pro tip unethical life
hack for you unethical
life pro tip how to get a full appetizer
for yourself
the only thing is like you got to be
careful because if you end up
eating with another sicko you guys are

gonna get stinky
gonna be trying to shove that pickled
herring caper red onion sort of

hey buddy thank you tomo for your help
i appreciate it
yeah they're called rag dolls because
they're like supposed to
flop when you pick them up like they
just go completely limp
in my experience that's not what happens
with tomo
instead he he's a squirmer they should
call him a squirm doll
no you know what they should call they
should call him heimdall you know from
from thor
okay we got to use our orbital man we
got a farm it's just that simple
tomo how would you like it if your name
was heimdall
you hear that he gave me a little squeak
i thought for sure we were not gonna get
hit there hey buddy
i'm doll you okay he's like oh he's
going crazy
he's like a hey hey hey
i guard the bifrost exactly
now you're getting it
this run you just know it's got like
some heavy meme energy coming out of it
placenta is insanely great here
he's my man he's going up on two legs
here
blessed territory hey excuse me tomorrow
you can't get in the cords my man
can't get in the cords
i like this room there's a lot of pog
potential here tomorrow you can't get in
the
time doll you can't get in the cords
you're supposed to be guarding the
bifrost right now in order to make sure
that
the mischievous loki doesn't try to
steal
the bifrost and use it for
interdimensional shenanigans
oops that's not what i'm actually that's
fine let's not do this again let's just
ice these guys they're like the worst
where is loki from again it's like it's
bothering me now
in in infinity war he's like son of the
yodenheim i'm loki crown prince of
yodenheim
that's right i forgot i knew it i knew
it was related to an indie game that
came out a couple years ago
he's from hamilton ontario pog dude
that's pretty exciting
you think he went to mcmaster hey any
canadians here do you remember the band
mcmaster and james
when the sun is gonna shine don't you
worry about tomorrow
everything will turn out fine
yeah yeah you remember them baby love
wins every three
times what happened to mcmaster and
james dude
there was a there was a couple years and
by that i mean a couple weeks
where mcmaster and james was like
unbelievably popular you'd hear him
everywhere
they were half of the philosopher kings
the other half became prozac
what no way
is that true that's crazy i had no idea
that
so you're telling me that the
philosopher kings was actually
like a super group that was made up of
prozac
and mcmaster and james like an emerson
lake and palmer sort of thing
who are these people it's a canadian
thing you wouldn't get it they're from
canada
how's rick moranis doing these days i
don't know he moved to
your country and then someone punched
him in the face on the sidewalk like a
couple of months ago
way to go
i'm assuming you're from america but
might not be true i do know the arkells
um at hillside 2009 or 2010
i saw the arkells play mouth was there
hello mouth
it is weird knowing that they're like
you know
pretty popular by canadian standards now
like last year when the pandemic ended
sorry they were they were playing their
uh their rock anthem uh
you know everywhere on like the cbc it's
been yeah
since we found this where finally our
long national nightmare is over
do it do it it's an ice bucket challenge
yo just give me a minute okay
just give me a freaking second to figure
this out
i think we're in a lot of trouble here
i had to finish this thing off with my
freaking orbitals dude
steven if you could if you could land
some shots in there
go along they'll go a long way oh no put
put it
put that away we need to farm jesse
we need to farm
any percent little steven beats mom's
heart
tiny little weird man up in mom's guts
4k i'm sorry i never should have said
that but it is
it's kind of humorous huh um i don't
know man let's
let's reroll let's see what happens
straw
bob's head turned into straw
with the birds i'll share this lonely
view straw plus 40 damage
that doesn't seem like 40 damage but i
gotta be honest i think straw is like
straw seems pretty good
check this out dude check this out oops
it
totally it did absolutely nothing um
i know you're like use the emperor card
well i was trying to farm up some
freaking
life first excuse me
we're just chilling like i honestly
think as as
horrible as this looks oh that was not
what i meant to do
the right play here might be to just use
straw for a little bit
to see if we get some red hearts out of
it
or some spirit hearts which would also
give us ammo
but then again i'm like i'm not too
confident in my ability to survive
through this
yeah so you know what
not after everything we've been through
i was getting chased down man
slash marker i don't remember what this
one's called
baptism by



melt again all right we're back with
team melts
um we have never completed this
challenge before
if you're wondering what the heck does
this challenge entail
everything is random and nothing can be
trusted
that's that's all i can say you may find
yourself asking questions
like what's happening nobody knows
the only thing you can really do is is
fend for yourself right
this is a bit of a tricky room just give
me a second here steven seagulls
thank you for the the gifted
subscriptions thank you
this one's for you steven seagulls as i
find myself
under siege i cannot name
another steven seagal film
under siege 2 exit wounds he's in
exit wounds rip dmx
that's all i got though that's genuinely
all i got
why is it just a white background um
it's a good question it's because we're
in the north pole
this is uh two face fetch
stop trying to make fetch happen none of
our stats have changed and i'm
farting every time i pick up a coin okay
so be it dude that's a tough question
for a dollar named
a steven seagal film i would bet the
majority of the population could not do
it
i think i have better movie knowledge
than
the average uh person
and i can only name a couple i think
most people couldn't
maybe i would say men
from the age of 50 to 63
might have a chance
you know what now i'm just remembering
steven seagal wasn't he actually the
villain from the first machete movie
so maybe i mean machete was not that
popular of a movie to begin with but it
is slightly more contemporary than than
under siege at least
who was in cradle to the grave
that's jet li
and dmx okay not steven seagal
i always get cradle to the grave
and um
and exit wounds confused and then also
there's another movie
isn't dmx in a movie where like
there's like a a prison riot or
something
you know what i'm talking half past dead
that's another one that's that's just
the steven seagal classic but no the
what's the prison one
not romeo must die
not breaking bad that's that's a good
one though i don't think steven seagal
was in that
executive decision steven seagal gets
sucked out of an airplane
i can't remember what what movie is it
where i think arnold schwarzenegger
is like he's paris shooting and they try
to crash an airplane
into him ib bud sworn pro
how about that and then he shoots
the cockpit window out of the airplane
that's eraser okay i've never seen it
you know what i did see
for i think the first time the other day
i watched half of true lies
i've gotta say fun movie i was having a
good time
also arnold uh
arnold schwarzenegger probably
might be the worst husband in movie
history in
in true lies he thinks his wife is
cheating on him and he works for the fbi
or whatever like
the cia
so he he takes her into interrogation
and like intimidates her using like a
robot voice and stuff like that and then
forces her to like in order to not
reveal
that she attempted to be a spy
forces her to do a lap dance for a
foreign
agent but then it turns out the foreign
agent was just him
so then she smacks him on the head with
the telephone
and then he gets kidnapped by like i
think the mexican drug cartel i can't
remember that sort of stuff wouldn't fly
now by the way
up over he's we're doing it we're doing
it i mean how could i not take this
bag portable b how could i not take it
walks you i'm not taking that that's too
much
i'll take that though that looks good
lay money talks oh no
oh oh no
look i don't know 12 room charge i sleep
degas you'd love to see it no idea what
that is but to be honest with you
sometimes not knowing what your space
bar item does is very good
it's a normal floor kind of
so many poops dude
uh homing booger tears are you seeing
this
that's actually incredible
oh no what the heck is that every time i
get hit it spawns a monstro
stop picking up items absolutely not i
refuse
that's that's cowardly p34
infestation
you know what let's see what it does to
enemies
[Laughter]
nothing at all i i do be mashin though i
do be mashin
it is infinite use it does nothing but
it's infinite use how about that
imagine trying to stop the zayn exactly
true lies seemed kind of fun though
i mean arnold you know he
in in the battle between arnold and
sylvester
arnold had a much better movie library
don't get me wrong they were both in a
lot of stinkers
there's a lot of garbage in in both of
their filmographies
um like i mean sylvester stallone has
stopped or my mom will shoot which is
one of the
possibly worst movies ever made arnold's
got some
some bad stuff as well you know
collateral damage is pretty bad for
example
but terminator 1 terminator 2
commando true lies
he's been in a lot of arnold
schwarzenegger's been in a lot of good
stuff sylvester stallone is really just
rocky and then like first blood
total recall i haven't seen total recall
but i i
i i would be remiss to not mention it
because i know that it's well liked
expendables oh i forgot about predator
yeah i mean
expendables is is a bad movie i wish it
weren't
because i i have a real soft spot for
all that like classic
like 80s rah-rah macho stuff
but uh i think it's pretty bad by the
way bhp plus luck you
yeah that looks pretty good i'm glad we
picked that up
[Laughter]
um i don't know what's going on there
hey
and by the way i want to say i agree
with people
so i didn't watch um this looks this
looks fine
i didn't watch
uh last action hero when it came out
i watched last action hero in university
like 12 years ago which was also about
15 years after it came out
and i was like this movie's amazing like
it's
it's subversive it's almost got like a
little tropic thunder thing going on
with like the
the media satire going on in it
i went to rotten tomatoes thinking like
this movie must be beloved
go to rotten tomatoes it's considered
like one of the biggest flops of all
time
everybody uh at when it came out
freaking hated it
it's crazy man i was having a great time
in that watching that movie
i mean it's not very good i don't know
man i disagree i think it's great
the critics actually put out a hit on
last action hero
all right i mean i have no idea what's
happening on this run but
i have no idea what's happening on any
run
basically so on any run with t-melt at
least
like i think this is incredible so the
next challenge is
can we uh pick up enough items to ruin
the run so we have a good excuse to play
more team else
we'll see
like look at this what what on earth is
that
all i know is isaac and his mother lived
alone in a small house
on the hill don't care didn't ask plus
you're a homeowner
gh baby growth hormone
i have no idea what that is but let's go
with
what the heck is happening man i think
we re-rolled an item
yeah i have no idea um let's take this
let's take ghc drone
uh every time i go through every time i
take damage i
send a bomb that's not so bad
a can of corn can of corn and i'll be
all right
hey hey get out of here you're nothing
so the story as well of that um
the guy who yelled you've got no talent
you're flat etc etc
it gets deeper and deeper
no idea what that is um
somebody posted a video on the subreddit
of him
uh yelling at some street performers
doing almost exactly
the same spiel that he did in the viral
video um
so you start thinking like wait is this
like a thing that he has a habit of or
is this like maybe he's like an
actor or something um or like maybe he's
a comedian i don't understand
but the the people that he was yelling
at
i was like i'm pretty sure that's uh
indie recording artist ariel pink
so all i'm gonna say is the story just
keeps getting
like more and more uh
confusing for me like i don't have it
it just gets weirder and weirder like
i'm realizing now like i think if you go
back and look at like historical
photographs and stuff like that
oh there's a key in here probably all
right
um there was if you go back and look at
like historical photographs and stuff
like that
i'm pretty sure that you'll see like
neil armstrong putting the
the american flag on the moon and when
he like opens this helmet which he
probably shouldn't do i guess
um new york flight baby
it's actually gonna be the guy who says
you've got no talent
i landed eagle one on the moon in 1969.
who do you think you are i nailed the 95
tenants to the church door in 1734
i taught martin luther everything he
knows who do you think you are
i just like i i can't i i can't
figure out like what what's going on
with this guy
i don't know what year the martin luther
stuff was it's probably 1374 not 1734
but like many people in north america
history starts for me in about the year
1926.
nine perga oh dude that looks pretty
sick
how about that
all right take me down this still seems
pretty good
thanks perga new york flight baby
tell me your new york flight without
telling me your new york flight it was
in the 1500s
i'm gonna be honest i know nothing
like i i'm just like i have a lot of
trivial knowledge in my brain
and very little i have a lot of thoughts
for sure but very little actual actual
like meaningful knowledge or experience
inside of my brain
that's why i cling so hard to like you
know making this job work as a career
because like there really are load
amounts of transferable skills you know
i think if you if you are a pro streamer
for like three or four years in your 20s
if you had to pivot to another industry
you could do it
now i've i've already wasted all of my
prime learning years
my neuroplasticity is uh is totally shot
like this is what you see is what you
get for basically like the rest of your
life
apparently there's still enemies here
what's going on
you could be a good community manager
maybe i am like uh
i'm i'm used to being yelled at
what i'm not used to though is replying
with um
like fake apologies
like when you're a community manager i
don't know i don't know if community
managers
on mass have the ability to just slash
ban people
i hope they do because honestly like
even if you're even if you put
you know ten thousand dollars in the
gal gun or whatever like
i feel like if you magic eight ball shot
mh
uh even if you're like a you know if you
financially supported a game if you like
say super negative things to the
community manager instead of being like
oh we're sorry for your experience i
think they should be like you know
guess what dummy you know just cut you
off
boom baby but i'm pretty sure that
actually they can't do that
i think they've got to be like we're
sorry that you experienced something so
bad that it made you say those terrible
things to me
i don't know i don't have too much
experience in that department
might depend where you get hired yeah
i actually think you know what would be
like and things are going pretty well
although i did lose 3 000 followers
today
so i don't know but um
i think what would be a cool job for me
if i ever wanted to like stop streaming
is i could just work for streamers and
tell them what to stream
um and then take like a little cut like
maybe something small like 40 percent
i think twitch would be a better place
if i got to choose what everybody else
streamed
um i think this might be sick let's give
it a try
yeah like a streaming consultant exactly
because like sometimes see i see
streamers well i don't know like so
there was this
and anytime we talk about the business
like a certain amount of people get
annoyed so i apologize but there was a
you know those
uh engagement farming tweets that has
the guy from like the road to el dorado
or whatever with all the swords around
him and it's like you know tell me your
opinion on flowers that makes people
react like this
um there was one of those about
streaming
and there's a lot that i agreed with
that people were tweeting right
like some of the some of them were like
one of the ones i agree with the most
is people were like uh
hey the recipe for doing badly on twitch
is just to play whatever you want
and not worry about like you know what
people want to see and i was like i
agree with that 100
i'm glad to see that there's other
like-minded spirits out there
but then oh that's from tangled why why
did they reuse the animation from uh
from road del dorado then that's the
same guy from road del dorado
that was a good eraser man no question
i'm not even trying to bait tangles a
little after my time this is knee bomb
by the way it's an s
plus shot speed up it also generates a
little hot
for one room anyway
um
but then like the one that was probably
the enemy we erased dude
it erases oh my god we're gonna win
we're actually gonna win
the my hot take that i'll never tweet
but instead i'll bring it up here which
is actually like
probably going to be even more annoying
um is
if you treat your stream let
it if you treat it once you're pro
as a business instead of as a hobby
you'll not only like do better but i
think you'll be happier as well
that's that's my take on that mimic
like i think a lot of streamers pay like
not enough mind to like
i id tempora i'm taking one more i'm not
scared that's car bat dude
i guess i'll be losing my infinitely
charged eraser
i've decided i'm not gonna do the boss
rush anymore
[Laughter]
but i'm like i feel like a lot of
streamers don't really like think about
what they're gonna play
and like even big street maybe
especially big streamers
i think they're just like i'm just going
to go live with like whatever i feel and
sometimes it works but
i'm also i think if what is all i can do
is speak to my own
it's tier detonator is like
speak to my own experience obviously
we're playing a lot of isaac right now
but it's like a
it's kind of a unique period um
but what has helped me out a lot is just
like every week keeping a schedule of
what i'm playing
and then i'm like you know
this is still really good um i keep a
schedule of what i'm playing and i like
try to fit new stuff onto it on the
regular to make sure i'm constantly like
mixing it up and
you know and admittedly like killing
some stuff that a
vocal minority of people really enjoyed
because it's analytics poison like that
nobody wants to say everybody wants if
people want to be like i'm just
monetizing my hobby but i'm like i don't
know i think you gotta
paying some attention to to what people
like uh
and what people like to watch as well
and then making tweaks i think it
matters
but we're in like this beautiful period
right now where like what people want to
watch and what i want to play is the
same
like i was gonna introduce some extra
variety today
i like because i
i i get self-conscious about the fact
that i've been playing so much of the
same game
um but then i was like you know what i'm
having a great time
playing repentance and like you know
also the numbers don't lie so it's kind
of like
right now it's almost like too easy but
in the in the normal
circumstances that's my my take on it
we're in a very like
kind of an outlier of a position right
now
like is this game that just came out
called internet court that's like an fmv
ace attorney sort of thing 100
gonna check it out in the future but
maybe not today
slash definitely not today oh my
freaking demon hearts turned into bombs
but i'm very glad that this is not like
this is not cynical isaac
you know what i mean
like this is not like oh new dlc came
out i
absolutely have to play it even though
like it's
kind of 50 50. like they actually just
did such an amazing job with repentance
that it's like
it's that beautiful venn diagram
yeah don't press the space bar after you
get the trophy
okay don't press the space bar after you
get the trophy
duly noted or do it and then have an
excuse to do more team out
it is an interesting prospect dude this
is like a really
strong team out here
yeah internet court looks cool i'm
excited to check it out i am excited to
get back to more variety as well
but i'll be honest like you know i
played some pac-man
99 on sunday i was gonna do like more
sometime this week and then i looked at
the youtube videos and
like the analytics were like nobody
likes watching this and
we think you stink if you keep making
more of these videos the is going to
crush you
indiscriminately and i was like all
right maybe we'll just play like more
repentance today then and i'll i'll play
some
i'll play some pac-man in my down time
[Laughter]
but i felt bad because i was like i told
dan i was like dude you gotta do the
tetris journey for pac-man 99 it'll be
so much fun and then like you know
as soon as the vod came out youtube the
graph was like a hockey stick but
pointing down instead of pointing up and
i was like oh
sorry daniel my bad
maybe it'll work better for you than it
did for me
halloween okay we almost crashed the
game getting hit
also my did you see my card uh phase out
of existence there
no don't
re-roll spirit hearts nailed it
dude okay so all we need is very simple
all we need is an emperor card
a simple emperor card and i will be just
fine
all right so far so good probably
play the slot machine
i feel like with our space bar item
safety scissors might be pretty sick
what the heck is flat file no more
spikes
and we'll see
do hold on jawbreaker is actually
assuming it works with this cool
brimstone it should work very well
isn't this dude these are so many good
trinkets
like jawbreaker gives you occasional
tough love shots
blessed penny doesn't i was just gonna
say it gives you spirit hearts on coins
or at least a chance for it or hearts on
coins at least we got it we got to keep
that going
okay get ready wait wait for the angel
statues to spawn
and then we press the button
we didn't even have to press the button
oh that's good stuff okay
we're only 23 minutes in too this is
crazy i was i was setting up the
the all-time hahaha run on youtube
yesterday
and i was laughing like i literally get
to the cathedral
like 30 minutes into the run and it's 50
minutes long
and then that one room on the on the
room just before the boss on the
cathedral was like eight minutes all by
itself or something it was just
it was crazy this is uh bumbo
couldn't agree more doctor's remote end
controlled friend
we should be careful with our space bar
matchbook ev elon's been real quiet
since the new matchbook just dropped
and strange at true
all right well dude i mean honestly this
is pretty solid because we know
what it is we got to be careful about
not turning our trophy
into a bomb but the remote detonator
part of it is
extremely good
does car bat suck the items
you know it's an interesting question
let's let's give it a check uh once we
uh i have dark arts apparently
we're never gonna use that properly well
it turned
it into bombs at least w scatterbomb
i just have no clue
don't care didn't ask plus you got sad
bombs okay so we have like a passive
dark arts
um starting to think i should have
brought safety scissors
i think that er
there's a curse of the tower yeah
there's definitely a curse of the tower
somewhere in here
i don't know completely where but i was
just gonna say if if
an enemy hits us they will also kill
themselves
via our bombs what is happening man okay
no no you gotta die last
i think you're gonna die first
saved highly saved
yeah this is just team melt man you
never know what you're gonna get like
sometimes you're gonna open a chest and
you're to get puffy buddy
and you're going to be like what's that
and they're going to be like oh it's a
shot speed upgrade
and then you're going to go into a new
room and they're going to be like
surprised actually it's
a tears upgrade that slowly decays over
time
and then by the way guess what you got a
new range upgrade oh guess what actually
it's a shot speed downgrade now
it's hard to diagnose oh no
no no no no no
also every time we get hit it also
creates monstro don't forget about that
you guys we got some serious funkiness
going on
oh yeah congrats funky kong jorts by the
way
congrats for becoming the number one uh
twitter
or the number one search results
for funky kong twitter
that's a major milestone
we have lost our spacebar item but i
think it might be good uh vb mate
long neck vb i don't even know what it
means but he's violin
these violin delights have violent ends
okay whatever it was i think there's
there's a stopwatch in there somewhere
and it's it's actually like it seems
pretty great
quite frankly that being said i also
can't see my
uh my own tears they're the they blend
in with the floor
let me go um the d7 is now a trinket
so that's a new one um
we just shot an eraser out of our face
that seems really good
dude we're gonna win we're gonna win
right here unless this screws it up we
gotta take it
oh bears hmm
okay doesn't seem that bad
the d6 dude oh we must look there must
be an item that gives you the dice as
trinkets or something
um help me
mission accomplished hold on hold on
hold on
hold on hold on i had to try
i had to i had the clip farm yo team out
we've unlocked the temperance card
finally
how exciting that was a good run slash
marker
successful team melts



there you go um let's run it back here
and uh we're gonna play his tainted blue
baby before we do
team out i promise you were going back
to team i'm not trying to tease you
there's just a lot of like life
left in this game we will return to tml
so no bombs only poop hold
three poop
that's a poo there's a piece of poop on
the ground i got an idea let me guess
what
i don't know what's happening um
i don't know what's happening
uh
you have a queue of poop in a set order
how about that
bro what's happening bomb button to use
it or you can hold it
bomb button to use it okay i like to use
it use it
i like to use it
of all the characters in this game
this is the one that's most i i don't
understand
i don't understand what i'm doing i'm so
confused
oh there you go there you go okay
so you load up a poop like so
and then you you get an all-status
upgrade out of it that's pretty cool and
then you load up
a poop and then you
you get to put it down on the ground and
it does some like aoe
oh you get a stat boost on the creep
okay
there you go you do get a stab boost on
the creep you're not you're not kidding
okay now that's a good poop
it's just like how you hold a piece in
tetris
okay kind of like
i don't get it i said okay but i'm just
gonna be honest i don't understand
i know you can hold a piece of tetris it
just takes me a second to figure out
like what the heck
okay so we if we get a great poop we put
it in the hold place and then we can use
it
later like for example if if there's a
poop that gives us a lot of damage we
can save that for like a boss or
something okay
all right understood easy easy i don't
know what i was complaining about it's
pretty easy actually
um
dude we gotta just try to like stay
alive to be honest
name a poop library now we're talking
book of revelations whether it be real
nice
you'll just have to learn the types of
poops
like this is fiery red poop
could potentially be very good against
weak enemies
i don't know what this is this is a
petrified poop
i don't know what you do apparently
nothing
this is also a this is the bristol stool
chart
i'm familiar with that i have a child
i'm a man i'm 40.
what what the heck is is pepto-bismol
poop
it's just hard to break it's like dry
and crusty then this one's just like a
normal poop oh it does do
contact damage okay poison poop
now we're talking that's some good stuff
bomb poop please place this
i know we can get some money here but
please place that into hold
oh dude wait hold on a second hold on a
second
i'm a genius
possibly one of the highest iq gamers in
isaac history
we can just hold a stinky poop over our
head
uh and quite easily destroy
all enemies that have the uh stupidity
to get in our way
and then throw it because i didn't know
how to get out of it you should do a
funny
sports uh quote slash
meme list you know what it's an
interesting idea i gotta tell you if the
castellanos meme had existed when i was
in university i would be like even more
insufferable than i already am
when i was in university all we had was
boom goes the dynamite
oh hello daniel chad hello welcome
you're lucky that i know that dan
doesn't know
internet toxicity and cyber bullying if
you raided like a random streamer
and they hit you with like you know soy
smiley face
people would be like they would report
you probably
for toxicity but because i know it's
from daniel and because i know daniel
doesn't know what he's talking about i'd
take no offense
wait for real kind of yeah so like soy
is like um you you're suggesting that
someone's not like a real man you know
it's it's like internet parlance
okay hold on this is good it's good
anyway um but like when i was in
university the only thing we had was
like
boom goes the dynamite which i still
think is a great video
perkins shoots the shot and
he nails it it's a great video
oh okay that's pretty good regular poop
no thank you
farting poop yes
what does castellanos mean okay so we
described it yesterday i will do it
one more time a uh an announcer for the
cincinnati reds
baseball team said uh some things that i
won't repeat that were highly offensive
uh a genuine fireable offense
and then it got caught on the broadcast
i need to hold it over my head
saved it saved this is so stupid don't
do this
it got caught on the broadcast
i can't do this right now hold on save
save all right all right we live now i
can explain the meme okay
it got caught on the broadcast so then
he had to explain
that he was going to be like you know
taking a leave of absence
but for this awful comment that he made
but in the middle
of his explanation castellanos
with a drive to deep left field
that's going to be a home run and we've
got a four nothing ball game
i don't know if i'll if i'll ever step
foot in the booth again after this
it's extremely good it's like the
saddest home run call in history
really donkey donkey donkey donkey
there was a tinted rock apparently where
where is tinted rock
dunk donkey donkey see in the secret
room
really
they're called cross rocks now hello jay
jay are you
from are you a fan of the uh castellanos
with the drive in a deep left field
meme great tinted rock that's a solid
one
jay are you a fan of uh no
not the hot mic statement come on i
would never try to
you know railroad you like that
you are you a fan of the the incredible
uh
juxtaposition of it it generates flies
for us thank you
um of his sadness combined with the uh
the fact that he's calling the most
exciting play in baseball a home run
that's what that's what appeals to me i
guess someone in chat
asked is is this easy mode
this is the hardest thing i've ever had
to do with this game man i don't know
what's happening
i don't look at that i'm just blowing up
for no reason
i know the reason okay what
what i don't even have any bombs anymore
why am i not just shooting my tears just
shoot your tears dude
what is what is this
anyway i forgot what i was talking about
yeah i don't have to use the poop i
guess i could just get like a good run
that'd be that'd be worth something
can't use bombs though
it's talking about sports quotes i mean
boom goes the dynamite is
is an all-time classic video it's made
even more humorous by the fact that his
local
college is called ball state which i
know is a real thing but it's i mean you
gotta admit it's
it's quite humorous
wait i this is a genuine question okay
what's up with
american schools calling themselves
blank state
when blank is not a name of the state
you know like
new york state university or something i
get
but whenever something's like uh like
boise state
i'm like what are you talking about
boise is a city like i shouldn't have to
tell you that you've got a college
degree apparently
solid state university now we're talking
so what the heck is ball state
and don't tell me it's an insurance
company that protects your testicles
it's from ball county come on man
this is a family show
have i have i told the story of boise
state yet
it was a pax that i went to um josh was
at this one
we went to uh the yard house
which is a an establishment a national
uh brew pub chain
where they serve you beer in incredibly
large and tall glasses
and uh we were just there like mining
our own business
and then a bunch of people wearing
purple
uh gear came in and they had like a
whole rehearsed like parade and stuff
they were like blazy
straight boise state no didn't care at
all by the way about the fact that like
some people were just in the restaurant
like trying to enjoy
their lives or whatever and have no idea
what the heck you're talking about
um
you made me part of like your your weird
college uh
football thing anyway so apparently
boise state was playing uh
in a college game that day and then they
were so excited they're like hey we're
gonna crush it boise state baby boise
state like every table was just full of
people
and this was in washington state so i'm
pretty sure they were either like alumni
that you know live in seattle or
alternatively they're like
um you know literally did like uh
like they were doing like a bus tour
like the grateful dead fans do
or something like that to be like hey um
you know let's let's go
to like we're not gonna go to the game
necessarily but let's like go to the
city where the game's taking place in
and cause a ruckus
and then later that day saw a lot of
very very
sad people wearing all purple and orange
gear and
it turns out that boise state had lost
i consider myself a man of faith and
that's castellanos with a deep drive to
left field
that'll be a home run and uh it'll be a
4-0 ball game
i don't know if i'm ever going to put
this headset on again
what what the heck's happening here
yeah it's a place with a blue football
field i don't know man like i don't
it's just it's a different culture right
i'm not saying you won't get like
weirdos in canada like when the world
juniors were in vancouver there were
fist fights like
canada lost fist fight canada one fist
fight i was like why are you
what are you doing with your life you
know
but like to to come into like a
restaurant where like
other people that are unaffiliated with
the sport are dining
and then do like this weird bring it on
routine i was like man this would not
happen back home
mind you i'm not at home so what do you
expect but
remember the montreal riots because of
hockey 10 years ago bro that was in like
1956.
you're i i hate to do it i have to tell
you you're roasting the wrong city
montreal riots were several generations
ago it unfortunately was the vancouver
riots
that were that were merely a decade ago
we're we're almost past the 10-year
anniversary now though
and hold on like we don't want to get
into a competition of what countries had
zany or riots recently
just i mean hockey's not a good reason
to ride i'm just throwing that out there
exclamation point current events
got them send them send them
by the way i forgot to mention tomorrow
is um
a little spark mouth burp tomorrow is um
pummel party twitch rivals
very excited i will also be doing
um a little
interspersed segment you know how last
week during uh overcooked rivals
justin did a little geoguesser section
i am doing the geoguesser section at
halftime this week
i'm excited to see how it works the way
i understand it is like if i
answer the question correctly
then the person i'm partnered with who
is like just a viewer i think i think
they win some money so there's a lot of
pressure involved
what the heck did i press but there's
also you know it's going to be a fun
time
i'm in a lot of trouble here i'm in a
lot of trouble
okay what poop was that because that's
the poop i wanna hold
because it generates flies for us
i don't know what is it look it's corn
poop
corn poop was a bad dude i heard corn
poop
bro this is not corn poop this is
useless poop
i'm dead goodbye it was fun well it
lasted
um poison gas
okay give me one more give me one more
give me one more give me one more
give me one more give me one more give
me one more give me one more
donkey that run did nothing dude just
give me mom's knife so i can ignore
everything
else that's going on with this character
let's check this out check this out dude
okay what there's corn poop it's corn
poop hold it up
bro it doesn't do anything i've been
lying too it doesn't freaking do
anything
saved
if you'll excuse me i need some poops i
need to refill my poops
some poops for me please
corn poop monday baby
we're not doing the monday thing anymore
i'm i'm not sure everything's okay with
white claw gabe
the first uh the the first few times i
watched steak monday i thought he was
just
really excited i watched a few more of
his videos
and like i don't like the one that
really threw me for a loop was like
he was doing like hip thrusts in in his
garage he was doing like a home workout
and there was like a kid yelling at him
in the background that was going like
get it gabe oh oh and just kept making
like
you know lewd noises and i was like
i don't know what's going on with this
guy like i
it's just the situation's making me a
little uncomf i'm not suggesting gabe's
doing anything untoward
but i am like
i'm not sure if he's fully in on the
joke maybe i guess is what i'm trying to
say
so instead i i i wish all white claw
gabes a great day uh and and have
have a good life okay i need to find
something new for monday
i do also need to find something new for
thursdays
people have linked me to um
out of touch thursdays it's not good
at the very least it's not for me um
i i don't understand it like ladies and
gentlemen the weekend
very funny i i laugh every time
we shop wednesday i laugh every time
uh oh dude if we hold that up maybe
we're invincible
uh out of touch thursday i think it's
just another thing where like
anime fans are you know they're they're
trying to force a round hole into a
square peg
like i i do enjoy uh
hauling outs but i just the video itself
brings me no pleasure
i also don't understand like every um
every thursday out of touch tweet also
says do your taxes it's out of touch
thursday i
i kind of don't get it
is it like one of those like so random
things
i like is it like a luigi or a yoshi
thing yoshi
got he was doing some tax fraud or
something right i don't remember
yeah this is tainted blue baby um i
don't know how to feel about it right
now
oh i guess it is i mean in theory it
would be tax day in america it were it
not for the fact that it got extended i
suppose that makes sense maybe maybe
it's just a timing thing
dude i can't i can't we got to just
figure out how to play this character
that's what makes him out of touch no
you're forcing it
you don't need like a a bunch of
footnotes to understand why ladies and
gentlemen it's the weekend is funny
you know you just get it right off the
bat
if you got to explain how to touch
thursday maybe
maybe this is not the environment for it
you know
oh no saved
the weekend one sucks too wrong highly
wrong
it's not the best we shop wednesday is
still the best
you can't force i'm willing to wait for
it you know we got plenty of time to
find something for every single
day we do need to find some a new monday
thing
i refuse thursday what a concept if you
like it you can do it but
thursday what a concept for me i i did
not enjoy the show russian doll
i stopped watching it after two episodes
it's not for me
that's all i got literally all i got
it's okay saturday for dad's and dad's
car
i'll accept it's not my favorite i find
it pandering
specifically to me but that's uh you
know maybe that's why i like it
that's the best poop right there stinky
poop is the best poop although i don't
know hold on
let me try something go ahead dude what
if we got an orbital
go ahead shoot me what
i thought it made you invincible
i was so excited rock poop just does
more damage when you throw it
it's a shield poop so i thought if i
held it over my head i would be shielded
can i get a quick explanation of this
character no
and it's it's not like mean-spirited
it's just like i
like if they're gonna explain it to you
i hope they explain it to me as well
because like i don't know what the
heck's going on
okay red red poop is is good we can save
that we can use our tears we can use red
poop on the boss
if you had no life we could stand here
um but i'm in the business of
entertainment sweetheart so let's hurry
up and get busy living or get busy dying
i think the best way to win a run
is um to just get a tear effect that
dominates
like what if we get mom's knife right
here that would change everything
fire poop great damage
we're on the second floor oh my god dude
what is this this is a regular poop
get it out of my face this is a bomb
i've wasted it
holy poop i don't mind
um but now i'm like hold on
hold it hold on he's done it he's done
it
okay
fired up a storm boys
you could just shoot him where's the fun
in that
oh this is what we're looking for right
here what about shooting some tears
you don't like napoleon you can leave
that's fly poop in the corner is
fly poop in the spotlight losing my
religion
okay that's good stuff right there don't
make the same mistake twice watch out
for the gas the gas will get you
um marrow bone hearts not so good as
blue baby
ma of the void you know what i mean i
think at this point
we basically just have to take um
and let's just head down to the next
floor let's like not use our poop at all
let's just use our uh
let's just use my other void man
oh hello spirit hearts pandora's box
name an item pandora's box heroes metal
uh i it's gonna give me speed probably
you know i know what i'm talking about i
i've been known to play a game or two of
this in my life
anytime you get one of these you're
gonna use it you're just gonna pop it in
the corner
is it not called the heroes medal
[Laughter]
i don't know i don't look at the items
i'm using i'm the consolation
prize i was i was way off samsonite
also known as heroes metal i don't know
where that came to me
from um it's a tinted rock yes sir
use use use use
use and run away wow well worth it look
at that
oh it is an item in gungeon that that
had left my brain how about that
one of these in the corner there you go
i think we can do it i think the secret
is not treating like your poops is the
only thing you can shoot and instead
treating your poops is like a bonus in
certain situations
i think that'll help
mclaffy taffy said that his kids love
watching you make up names for stuff in
isaac
nobody tell his kids that um
i'm not pretending and like that's
actually just
what i think they're called most of the
time when
i uh
there's an interesting meme uh tell tell
me you're from vancouver without telling
me you're from vancouver
um i don't know like what are the
emblematic characteristics of somebody
from vancouver
i would say standoffish in public is a
big one
um
i mean there's a certain like a hipster
culture in vancouver for sure but it's
like
it's less hipstery and more kind of
snobby for sure
i mean like these are not necessarily
like positive elements but
there's there's a definite snobbishness
to the city
which i think is why i fit in so well
tell me you're from vancouver without
telling me you're from vancouver yo
let me turn left onto this road what the
heck why are there so many people on the
street
ah my mistake
i see a rat three times a week you got
to be more specific that's not vancouver
only
that's not a fart oh dude pop it
no mother void you freaking screwed me
do it again
i suppose i did say pop it
so mob the void has been changed it no
longer generates
uh hearts for you
it has been nerfed um it's honestly like
it's okay
it's still very good and
uh i'm i'm actually inclined to agree
with this nerf
i think it's made the item a little bit
better or a little bit
more coherent with the rest of the game
let's say
honestly like i know how this is going
to sound many people will probably tell
you like don't insult your audience
but like any time anybody complains
about a nerf
in repentance i'm always just like
tell me you're a baby without telling me
you're a baby
we're gonna get here man we're just hold
on
you know what planetarium planetarium on
the next floor
sometimes a nerf is good and it makes
the game better
i just i i get annoyed that the barrier
to entry
for you know a a buff to be considered
good is like
you know zero they're like they made bad
item game winning
pog but then the barrier to entry for a
nerf is like
how dare they ruined we can't it's
illegal to have fun apparently
that's a planetarium dude we did it
like ma the void is still a very very
good item
it's maybe no longer like a win by
yourself type or win by itself type of
item
if you don't flame the devs you've lost
twice
you will be ashamed of your words and
your deeds
how do you get planetariums uh i can
only give you my experience which is
anytime i can't go to an item room chat
goes
planetarium and then i remember oh right
those are a thing that exists
and then i pretend that that was my plan
all along
it's a plus 20 chance for every skipped
item room
oh thank you i didn't know look at that
it's a
hard taco shell luna the moon's blessing
shines upon you
and now i judge how good the item is
based on the quality
or quantity i should say of uh pog champ
emotes in chat
there are several
okay now don't blow up in the gas please
he's done it it's okay oh
whoa whoa whoa oh what
uh-huh what tears upgrade okay i mean
that seems pretty sick
oh that's all i need two words from a
luke is worth an essay
he just said it's good i'll take your
word on that one
and the soul heart you're not wrong and
the soul heart
well there it goes but still
maybe it gives you an hp upgrade as
other characters i'm not sure
stop okay we're saved
anyway that's all i got uh from a humor
standpoint
i'm done with all the jokes man
we can come back we can get those we
just need a bomb to show up in our poop
rotation
what if we just pivoted to being like a
very serious twitch channel
like jay we should start like um
like we should become like one of those
politics and debate channels
that could be fun you ever considered
how fun that could be
like we could just invite people on the
show and then
like yell at them and be like you tell
me you honestly believe this
you know what he got his revenge
it's played out no we got to get in
quick like now is the perfect time to
get in
because then we can build the foundation
that's going to carry us you know when
the next u.s election happens
you don't want to get in when the
primaries are starting because then
people have already chosen
who they're gonna watch we gotta get in
before the primaries start so that we
can actually you know reap the rewards
when the primaries start
oh i've already been in the secret room
uh you know what it's just called it's a
shortcut you've never heard of a
shortcut
great item gemini
isn't that the guy who made pinocchio
down to the next floor to be a political
streamer you have to
let one chat comment derail the entire
stream um
unfortunately that's old me so you know
i don't know if i'm cut out for that
anymore
new me is positive vibes only
stun locked
okay don't step on creep use mother void
generate some spirit hearts
i think that the red poop is actually
pretty good
you just gotta actually land it
new you only mouths for two minutes that
i mean that's what i'm trying to do but
you know the thing is the problem is if
you do two minutes
and then you take 45 minutes off and
then you do another two minutes like it
adds up to more than two minutes
so we we could we we got to start like a
cumulative timer or something instead
i think we're doing better
can combo gas and fire poop dude i'm
just gonna like level with you that's
like too much for me
i accidentally blew up my own fly poop
thanks for harding my youtube comments
it makes me pog
i'm a simple man any youtube comment
in the top 20 comments let's call it
one scroll um
if it's just some combination of
positivity pog
new blank has been real quiet since
blank just dropped
etc etc like it's getting the heart
it's just that easy
no more harding monday steak baby we'll
we'll talk you know i gotta i gotta
figure it out
i had you know that that's for to
tonight me to worry about
i'm not a hard man to please in the
comments i mean you can't be like a
discerning
youtube comment reader you know as the
creator you're not going to be in there
like oh this person said they're having
a good time but they didn't phrase it in
a novel way
no heart you know they you reap what you
sow in that situation i think
you replied kindly to
a uh mean youtube comment i made years
ago and it changed my life
dude that must have been a long time ago
because now i just like indiscriminately
shadow ban
so honestly like you were i would say
you were born in the right generation
oh you're not wrong by the way i was
bragging yesterday so twitch
banned seven and a half million
uh accounts for like follow botting
and i they were like you might you might
notice sudden follower count drops
and then my follower count went up
yesterday and i was like thanks twitch
looks like i'm just built different
now it has gone down
about about two and a half thousand
that is going to put a little dent in
420 before 4
20.
but uh we're gonna keep trying we're
gonna we're gonna do our best
yeah i've seen that there are some
streamers who have lost like literally
two million like i didn't i didn't
realize that getting
follow botted was like a thing that
people had happen to them
like even justin was like uh
you know there have been times i put
chat and follower only and somebody gets
mad
and just like bots 5 000
followers to my channel i i don't know
what it accomplishes except like
i guess it's kind of annoying it annoys
the streamer
[Laughter]
like i was i was watching jay once and i
think he got follow botted and like it
just makes his notifications go crazy
for a little while
yeah during marbles that one time yeah
that was i mean it's just it
kills the vibe of the stream a little
bit
i'm an idiot i literally just walked on
top of it
i guess it does suck if you're like
brand new as well you got like you know
10 followers and then the next day you
have 3 000 like bought ones or something
i don't know man internet it's a it's a
weird place
i'm dead i'm alive
scratch that new ma the void is garbage
what is the best album by the worst band
you know that's a that's a very good
question
um i'm gonna say that the answer is
um okay computer by radiohead i'm just
joking i just wanted to make you mad
i i don't like
tainted blue baby slash marker i
hate this character okay

the one
tainted lost luck be a lady tonight

bullfold
tonight
i thought the bits were pretty good
thank you thank you
this is the one i do i i'm not happy we
wasted our mom's knife run though
what tainted characters have you
unlocked um
most of them at this point no i i don't
think i've gotten
blue baby or i just got blue baby
i know i definitely have not gotten eve
that's true i don't think i've even
played as eve
i also don't think i've unlocked tinted
maggie
or tinted lazarus maybe i'm not sure
dunk dunk dunk dunk
oh yeah tinted keeper i definitely do
not have so we're missing a few still
it's a tears upgrade i'm not against it
honestly i wouldn't mind getting the
book as well because it's a
nice reroll pedestal
i call them tainted tinted whatever it's
always
don't don't shoot them dude
look i have a lot of strengths speaking
clearly is not one of them
let me out thank you
how long does it take
can't glance from can't glance for a
moment
it takes like a minute we've done it
he's the greatest gamer of all time
it's actually probably faster than
getting the kill
okay plum flute play time
all right that's pretty cool it sounds
like the opening of a song by the go
team that being said you must be
rerolled
all right down to the next floor how
could you
the spice must flow baby the spice yeah
baby spice baby
luck upgrade baby

dude you know i got cheesed off all over
again yesterday i saw
a list of when movies were coming out oh
my god was a great shot i can't even be
mad
um i saw a list of when movies were
coming out you know i bought that lime
bubbly that said minions rise of gru in
theaters you know blah blah
you know it's not coming to theaters
until july 2022.
that's that's madness that's i mean i
get why don't get me wrong i'm just
saying like
they're already doing the marketing for
it i guess it got delayed again
because it because of covid but
it's a heavy re-roll
why not dude why not what could possibly
go wrong
i guess they already paid the the the
price for the bubbly marketing
it's a collector's item cruise plan
if you'll excuse me could you please
give me some of this money
the toys for the movies have been coming
out months before the movies
i mean i can't even like the last movie
that actually came out in theaters
that was also like a wide release was
definitely it was tenet right
and then like every other movie studio
was like thanks for taking that bullet
for us
uh christopher nolan and then
thanks for giving us that valuable
business intelligence so that we don't
send our
250 million dollar movie out to die
oh you know what kong vs godzilla did
come out in
it did come out in theaters that's fair
i think theaters will come back i mean
like i know like people have different
opinions
on them like especially with the the
rise over covet of like um
streaming services and like you know big
budget movies coming out on on digital
um but i think i think theaters will
come back i think enough people
consider them like a primary source of
like entertainment
uh and and you know getting outside of
the house i think they'll have a
recovery i think
but i know i mean there's a lot of
people that hated theaters before the
pandemic too
but once uh once things blow over
hopefully um i
i'm looking forward to going back to the
movies although
it'll it'll be a while as well because
we got the you another kid as well
so but we'll see
i like going to the theater
i hope when they come back they're
better than they used to be
um i don't know like
i'd be surprised i guess the one thing i
will say is that you know
i mean i guess it depends why you think
movie theaters suck like if you're
expecting ticket prices to go down
i don't think that's too likely or
concessions
um if you if you're expecting possibly
having more space between you
and your neighbor then it's that might
be possible that might be something i
i wouldn't be too surprised to hear that
that's that's commonplace but
that's all i got though i'm not a i'm
not an executive in the uh
in the theater industry
i have no insight i'm merely an
enthusiast
merely a consumer
but i don't know like what's the the
biggest problem people have with movie
theaters
other people talking during the movie
expensive
concession prices
for me any anytime i'm annoyed by the
movie theater it's
pretty much exclusively other people
yeah and i don't know like how you're
gonna do that unless you just give me
private access to the movie theater but
also don't raise prices so
i just i guess i kind of take the good
with the bad
it's decent
okay remind me to drop a trinket we
don't have one yet but like when when we
get one remind me to drop one
no bomb no bomb can of corn i'll no
we're not doing candy corn anymore
you could stay home instead no i like
the theater
didn't you watch revenge of the sith
only a sith deal is an absolute smartie
you can have all criticism about
something without like just choosing to
never interface with it again
son of a
hold on for a dollar drop a trinket okay
you don't need to remind me to drop a
trinket just yet
they let you bring home-cooked food in
now but like why would a theater
i mean i get to this i think it's just a
joke but like why would a theater do
that
i'll be honest i wish like concession
prices were cheaper but i think i'm
actually kind of happy that most people
don't bring in home-cooked food
like i don't want to walk into a theater
that smells like you know oh
like hey someone's eating like homemade
chili fries someone else brought in
egg salad someone's cracking open cans
of tuna halfway through
by the way we got like samosas heating
up in the 17th row like
i'm kind of happy that it just sort of
smells like old chewing gum in there
can a tuna can of tuna i'll be all right
exactly
bringing in my panini press bringing
oh dude you couldn't bring in the air
fryer that thing's like a jet engine
mmm
or could you
why would you spend money to go to the
movies when they just advertise to you
i say this with all due respect and it
it's gonna seem like obvious i guess
because of the business that i work in
but i'm not one of those guys
who is like ever worried about being
advertised to
like i under i i understand that there
are people out there that are like that
that are like under nose like a friend's
dad when i was growing up was one of
those people who was like when the
commercials came on tv
he turned the channel but he didn't turn
the channel
to watch something else he was just like
i refuse
on principle to watch commercials and i
was like all right man
some of them are pretty funny so you're
missing out
like have you seen the one that goes
like a wes up
but um i've never really been
that oh well you know we didn't want the
item anyway i guess
i've never really been like that
concerned about being advertised to i
just kind of treat it as like you know
i don't know like i think a lot of
people are in the same boat as me on
this one
whenever i'm in the theaters and they're
playing like you know ads for
like the hyundai elantra or something
like that
i'm kind of just chilling i'm like whoa
i've never seen this commercial on a
screen this big before
i'm eating my i'm eating my popcorn and
drinking a soda like i'm
i'm doing okay
and back in my day you know when i go to
see the movies as like a 10 year old
people were like they hated trailers
which is
crazy to me i was like the trailers were
like half of the price of admission
there we go
i love the trailers i play a little game
with the trailers the
in my head i go is this movie going to
be good or is it going to be trash
and i i would say i have an above
average hit rate not perfect but an
above average hit rate
i also and i don't i'm not trying to
flex here but if you remember
the last i can't remember if it was the
game awards that we did the
co-broadcasting for or if it was sony's
state of play or whatever
but after after all the trailers people
were like hey i know
what's the move what's the game that you
saw there that you're most looking
forward to
that you think is going to be the best
and i said it takes two
you can go back i mean actually the vods
probably deleted you can go back you can
look at the chat logs
this looks like garbage garbage brothers
brothers rip-off is made by the same guy
but whatever
i was in there just being like hey this
looks pretty cool developers got a good
track record the trailer is kind of nice
people being dmca dmca look this looks
a bad bad game
it's ripping itself off yeah yeah go
look
i was pogging up for it i've been wrong
about many movies in the past
for example bad times of the el royale
saw
trailers for that thought this movie uh
looked like pure garbage
actually ended up being pretty good but
the beauty of a situation
uh where like you misjudge a trailer
is that you just say oh the trailers
didn't do it any justice
you just go oh bad trailer
you know what for peace of mind let's
leave two trinkets behind here
uh let's try this there all three of
them are pretty similar
i don't know what you are so this little
abaddon baby
hey oh yeah that's right i remember what
you are that's not bad
leave these trinkets behind you headed
down the can of corn and i'll be all
right
anyway yeah it's like you know if you
judge a trailer properly you go i
freaking
knew this was going to be amazing and if
you judge it wrong
then you just go wow the marketing team
didn't do any favors with this one i
thought it looked like a generic piece
of garbage and turns out it's actually
awesome
stop one of these days is gonna work
i will tell you i do get annoyed um
the the only time i get annoyed and so i
guess
we're kindred spirits here by
advertisements before movies is when i'm
on a long flight
like okay so we start the movie and then
it's like hey my name's like
you know bill money from like bill money
investments
and you're like okay hello bill money
fast forward fast forward
and it's you know hey you're already on
an airplane but like have you considered
buying a flight and i'm like one step
ahead of you and you're like fast
forward fast forward and you're like
bro i'm like a captive audience here
like
just just start my move this is like the
sixth movie i watched over the course of
this flight
and it's even worse like you don't they
don't do
any uh adjustment god help you if you
start watching a tv show
because they still we get this every
single time and it's amazing
if you start watching a tv show they
still play the same
four minutes ads before every tv
episode so if you if you're watching 10
episodes of television
you know you're seeing the same ad 10
times that's why you got to watch movies
instead
oh it always shows up when you flawless
three bosses that's good intel
thank you thank you
bro
saved we can't be dying like to this
enemy
that's just a sign that like we're
cursed
we have indeed we not only have we left
a trinket behind we've left two trinkets
behind so we're set
save three trinkets oh
yeah okay three drink i meant i meant
two on the first floor but yeah
three trinkets total you're right
forget what i was talking about i don't
know i like uh
i like movies i like going to the movie
theater i don't mind
you take the good with the bad i really
don't i i don't mind the ads at the
movie theater
i do mind other people i mean i
i know what like things trigger
my anger more than anything else i think
you know
everybody's different for me it's people
that think they're getting away with
something but are actually being very
obvious in what they're doing
like when you reserve seats for a movie
and then you go to sit down in the seat
that you reserved six weeks ago
and uh there's people sitting in the
seat
and you go like hey those are our seats
and they go oh
are they are they oh i thought these
were our seats and i'm like no you see
here you're in seat
one a two a and this
is 20 m it's in the dead center of the
theater
and yours is in the front left corner
because you bought the tickets in the
lobby
three minutes ago oh sorry we just
thought like you reserved tickets like
what
the day the movie was announced and then
like decided not to show up or whatever
oh like you're doing right now
so that like that's one or people who
are like you know they're
in the movie theater and like really
sneaky like maybe they brought some beer
in and they're like
shhh
you're like you just shut the frick up
and like open it just open and drink it
you're making it ten times more annoying
by the fact that you're like nobody
knows dude you're gonna give us away
nobody knows
nobody knows dude you just just nobody
cares is the real answer just freaking
open it up
literally they're just like i hope they
don't get so drunk that they throw up in
the theater halfway through the movie
that's the only thing people are worried
about
shut up i can handle my alcohol
you don't even know
yeah just bring a flask or or do what
other people do and have like you know
six beers at happy hour and then just
smuggle them in inside of your liver
it's not that complicated you drink a
berry a little shot
no it's like i mean i'm i'm not even
saying it's uh a good item
honestly the flies are pretty good too
why not that's actually that's helpful
um it's not that i hate fun it's just
like you know
different things bother different people
for me the thing that makes me like
super angry is when people in it i have
no idea what in my childhood caused this
people who think they're getting away
with something that they shouldn't be
doing
but are actually being like 10 times
more
annoying by thinking that they're
getting away with it while being
very very obvious about like making it
as clear as possible that they're doing
something badly
yeah we're going we're going back to the
let's go curse room five room
can of corn
hold on where there's a will there's a
way
uh way we swallow the trinket though
all right good that's why i don't
backtrack all right that's why i don't
backtrack
lesson learned
who's this guy and she keeps trying to
bait me by like trying to relate
everything to the canucks
that's almost as bad as the canucks
that's almost as
annoying as the canucks are you think i
don't know they're garbage i know
they're way more garbage than you
i know the inner machinations of their
garbage i watch like all their games
oh you you're you're so mad right now
i got you you're like
you look at you man you're like you're
so mad
unless you're a canucks player you you
couldn't possibly have the same amount
of distaste for the team that i do
stun lot streamer streamer gets
stun locked by obvious bait and
streamer gets stun locked by bait in
chat hold mods oh hold on mods are
starting to look at the message history
no hey come on you know hey man that's
not cool we were all just
it was all just fun and games here man
it was it was all just fun and games
here now you're starting to look at the
message history
okay hold on love doing it
so i love looking at the message history
too
because you get i think you you know if
you want to know what somebody's like
observe them when they don't think
anyone's watching them okay i could not
have phrased that creepier but i think
you get what i mean you know
it's like you ever watch like uh you
know a true crime documentary and
they've subpoenaed like phone records or
something
and in court they're like i never had a
phone call with this person and then
they're like
we have six hours of taped phone calls
between uh
the accused and uh this hit man in there
so uh how much will you charge
uh me to have her murdered
sir is that your voice on the on the
recording
um it is not my voice on the recording
my name is
name of accused oh my birth certificate

media from tipper gore
fff hold on i have some some messages on
discord let me see if everything's cool
today
oh yeah yeah yeah okay
it's just daniel asking if he should
sell his dogecoin
moving on
okay little focus goes a long way i know
deep within me i got the isaac skill
locked in
just gotta you know turn off the banter
about al pacino a little bit we got
nothing to worry about
it's not al anymore it's dunk
dude you got me craving a coffee though
i feel like this is i only had a one and
a half coffee today
i did the thing where you know i had a
cup of coffee and then i was like
i got more ice i filled up the glass
with the with ice i put the metal straw
in it
i was like oh i'm so excited to have my
second cup of coffee today
and then i took out the cold brew and
there was like a thimbleful left and i
was like
but you know what it's okay it happens
you just get
you know you learn to ration better for
the future
sometimes i i would say it's a 60 40
split
60 of the time i make my own cold brew
40 of the time i purchase pre brewed
cold brew
from the grocery store one of those
little conveniences
to uh
make life slightly easier in uh in the
baby era
cold brew is very easy to make for for
people that are asking
you don't really need too much
specialized equipment it's literally
just like
a vessel containing ground coffee and
cold water left overnight
and then the next day you drain it
through a filter into a into a pitcher
that's it
it is a luck upgrade i'm just i don't
want to take my chances too much and i
was like you know what
11 luck isn't that spectacular 12 on the
other hand oh baby
it's very easy
i thought he didn't backtrack oh well
excuse me i haven't been in my item room
yet
normally i i'm not gonna backtrack any
longer for
for such minor things
that earthlings cherish i grow tired
what does dr manhattan say
he's like i'm done with this i'm fed up
with this world
wait so you just leave ground coffee and
tap water in a vessel overnight and
serve with ice cubes the day after
i mean that's more or less honestly like
yes i mean it's it's very very
slightly more complicated
like i have a little plastic tub
you put a stopper in the bottom and then
a coffee filter
in after that then you fill it up with
ground coffee and water
you leave it for 12 to 24 hours
then you pull the stopper out and drain
it into like whatever vessel you would
like to hold it in forever
and uh and that's that man
that now you got coffee for up to two
weeks depending on how much you consume
yeah that's i got the i got the toddy
kit
it was sent to me by uh sushi cat sand
several years ago and uh absolutely
changed my coffee
habit life like i just i prefer
cold coffee to hot coffee to begin with
and then also the fact that you don't
have to
wait for it to brew or cool down to
drink it in the morning
is a is a nice touch
shut the speed up shot speed up
i'm not afraid
it's a great item like i i no stop
giving me credit for being zany
that's just the right decision you know
i hate that item though re-roll it ah
man
um i'm not a huge fan of poke go but
we're not going to get a re-roll here
i don't really care for the bible either
okay donkey donkey donkey oh hold on
hold on
hold on i'm blanking
who played in the mask i believe you're
thinking of jim carrey
the actor presently and formerly known
as jim carrey
um i can't uh i can't take a little
baggie even with phd at ruins cursed key
that's just a huge no can't we we've
made that mistake too many times in the
past
excuse me
keep talking about cold brew i'm curious
how and why
did you switch from hot coffee um
so the phases of my life i
i didn't drink any coffee then i started
to drink coffee and i drank uh
hot coffee because it was the default
you know you could get it at any gas
station
uh then i had cold coffee
for the first time in korea on a summer
day
and i was like you know what the heck is
this this is amazing
but i didn't know how to make it at home
and then a viewer sent the cold brew kit
and i found out how easy it was to make
it home and i've
never gone back since
that's the end of that
dude this gun seems pretty good am i
crazy
cold brew is just castrated coffee okay
here and let me guess
hold on and then sparkling water tastes
like
tv static and i don't like to go to the
movies because they
try to get me to buy a toyota corolla i
don't want to buy a toyota corolla i
already told you
i get it okay you're mad it's not cold
brews fault though
some of you guys you gotta examine
internally
what's going on there before you you
take it out on just a discretionary
consumer good
this will give us fire rate
he's the smartest gamer of all time
are you a tea guy no tea is just
castrated coffee
in my opinion i've been saying it for
years
i don't know if anybody else has picked
up on that yet
i i personally am not a i'm not a tea
guy
i don't dislike it but i i i mean like
you know sometimes like after uh dinner
a restaurant will be like can we get you
any coffee or tea and i'm like
why
you think i'm i just
i don't know i i've had some espresso
after dinner before you know but
i think i did it just to like flex right
i was like hey maybe i'm the kind of guy
that gets an espresso after dinner
and then like i you know did it for a
while and you know there's some pros and
some cons
it does come with some biscotti you're
not wrong so there's a positive there
but i don't know i just i didn't derive
as much pleasure from it as
i think i i thought i could
okay okay
biscotti low tier snack
you know i was gonna disagree but i have
never
uh i've never purchased biscotti for
myself
outside of a restaurant context so
i enjoy the flavor but how much could i
enjoy the flavor if i've never committed
to purchasing it at a grocery store
you're making me examine a little bit
about myself now you're making me
figure out what i really prioritize and
and now i'm thinking
no i'm thinking uh that's pretty good
it's making me do some self-reflection
exactly
you know i'm just gonna say why not on
that one
our luck is like outrageous
biscotti's just a way for them to sell
you stale cake
and you don't we don't we don't like
going to the movies because they
just play the advertisements they try to
get you to buy a honda accord i don't
want to buy a honda accord i'm a jeep
guy
you know i know and this is lacroix it
tastes like
water you told an alien what water is
supposed to taste like and
they made another it's not a
you know tell tell me about you as a
person
don't don't tell me about like what kind
of you know discretionary consumer goods
make you slightly
upset you know it's
could use some because what drives you
man like
what gets you out of bed in the morning
what has you
feeling good when you're closing your
eyes when you go to sleep at night
that's what i want to know
okay this run can pop in fact it already
did hold on
necropolis won
dude no joke so i i know that i've
talked up the virtues of breakfast
before
and uh again i don't i don't have i've
been hit by something
i don't have all the answers okay
um but i've said that a few times in the
past
like every once in a while someone will
be like um i feel kind of grumpy today
and i'll be like do you eat breakfast
and they're like i never eat breakfast
and then i'm like you should try it
sometime there's a reason people do it
and then
they do it not always a lot of times
they just want to argue instead and then
i say my mistake
good goodbye um but
okay that's good 15 luck that's pretty
good um and we got it
this is not our full card floor but
please remind me on the next floor
um sometimes they do it and that we've
seen it in chat a couple times even
they come back a couple of weeks later
and they go like hey
i started eating breakfast after you
mention it in an isaac episode and my
mood is way better
and i was like yeah man i mean it turns
out
oh no i'm a fool no i'm a genius it
turns out you know like
for a lot of people out there like
you're less grumpy when you you're not
hungry
but uh i've even noticed like on a
personal level
i don't really have a problem getting
out of bread
[Laughter]
he said going offline guys um i don't
really have a problem getting out of bed
to begin with but if i like bought a
breakfast i'm excited to eat it gets me
out of bed way faster
which usually has a positive affect on
my day
like if i buy half a dozen bagels and
some cream cheese
on average i bet i'm stalling the wake
up like 10 minutes less
on average as a as a rule
come on man
it's just place a bomb but it's like
it's more about the principle yeah
i had to put some backspin on it
are you a snooze guy no like and this is
like
not a flex it's actually almost like an
anti-flex
um i used to uh wake up
late i used to be like a 10 am guy uh
or or even 11 some days
which is crazy to think about looking
back there was literally
it was a formative experience for me um
there was a thanksgiving
in 2018 maybe where we went to our
in-laws place in washington
and it's like a three-hour drive right i
got super
tired but we didn't leave until like
i don't know maybe like nine so we
didn't get home until
12 30 or or one in the morning that was
like the last day
i slept in i was so tired
that like it it fundamentally in my
opinion changed me as a human being
the next day i woke up at like excuse me
we're just practicing the next day i
woke up at nine and i've uh
i've never gone back now i get up at
like you know
i go to bed at like 11 because i'm tired
and then i wake up at like
seven because i'm you know because i
went to bed at 11.
and uh i mean yeah we got the the the
classic like baby sleep regulator
there's a good donation man
okay we're going down to the next floor
yeah yeah
and i i know i talked about it with
justin when we were doing uh fall guys
twitch rivals but um
i don't know i just like i'm happier
waking up early
like i don't i don't like that feeling
of waking up
at like 11
and being like i wasted the whole
morning
i mean you get more of the night but i
know what you're doing with that night
come on
you're not burning the midnight oil
you're on discord
yeah i know you get like the same amount
of time overall but
i don't know i just i find myself using
my time better in the morning than i do
at night
there we go there we go
full card achieved you can call off the
dogs
yeah plus like i mean don't get me wrong
i love the baby maybe this is more
relatable for the parents out there
but like you would think maybe like as a
new parent the dream morning
is when i you know don't get woken up
until like nine
and i get a little extra sleep that is
far from the case
the dream morning
is actually when i wake up like an hour
before the baby
and i just get to like you know drink a
cup of coffee and and
hang out before the baby wakes up that's
the dream
no it's glancing to see if we had a
delivery
metal plate it itches
don't care didn't ask plus your dad
yeah i never remember what it does but
it does give you a spirit heart and
something else that i'm hoping is
invincibility but i don't know
um ouija board i normally don't like it
with ipac but as the lost i'm gonna give
it a try man
i'm gonna give it a try
you already have spectral tears as the
lost
yeah okay but if i didn't
then that would have been a pretty good
pickup
wouldn't you say okay so this once we
get it charged it's a deal with the
angel
but i don't know if we're ever gonna be
able to get it charged so here's what
we're gonna do we're gonna double
everything
we're gonna pick it up is it does it
come pre-charged it doesn't
okay we're not gonna get a charge so
we're just gonna re-roll it in the other
dice instead
and that's actually pretty good just
remember you gotta keep the fool
i'm drowsy nothing wrong with that but
we need the full card for now
think about the trinket trinkets uh oh
you you mean like in terms of like we'd
get a battery charge via consumables
probably
maybe
you never have to apologize for uh
leaving
the stream to watch one of my videos if
you leave the stream to watch somebody
else's stream
i'm gonna make you fill out like one of
those things when you canceled northern
antivirus that's like we're sorry to see
you go
could you please leave an essay oh it's
illegal for you to unsubscribe without
leaving an essay
what could i do to put you in a prime
sub today okay we take
it doesn't matter we take we take
whatever we leave
do you get anything out of watching vods
i actually don't know
if do you get advertisements when you
watch vods
no yes yes yes yes yes yes at the
beginning yes yes okay yeah
then i do i didn't know i honestly had
no idea
more than when you're live that's true
that's but i basically
just stopped running ads temporarily
it's worth a shot okay still tough
though still tough
i gotta remember how did we screw this
up last time
i can't always we didn't take the full
card last time no ads are like
i mean they're good to run
don't get me wrong like from a financial
standpoint
but if i run like 12 minutes of ads over
the course of a five hour stream and i
miss out on one extra isaac run that i
could have done and then push to youtube
it's it's tricky you know it's a tricky
situation
gotta you gotta make your choice please
just get stomped
i think you you've i'm scared i don't
know what you do
i shouldn't have done this i should just
try to get to home
i don't know what that is what are you
doing what the heck are you doing
what are you dude i don't get me out of
here
okay you juggle that's your thing you're
a juggler
i can do a lot of damage before you
finish this
he's done it okay let me out i i never
want to do that again i apologize
scared the crap out of me man
what's the worst song that could be
played at a funeral it's an interesting
question
i definitely think like benny hill theme
is
is up there i mean it depends you know i
mean what's
you know down with the sickness or
something like that there's there's a
lot of
there's a lot of stuff
but i kind of feel like if somebody
deliberately picked here here's my
methodology okay
if somebody deliberately picked the
funniest song to play at a funeral then
i would laugh because like their dying
wish was to entertain people that's
funny
what would be the worst song then in
that case for me is somebody placed a
lot of meaning in a song that i feel
does not merit it
and instead they were like
like almost like just an unbelievably
overly sentimental song or something
like that oh that could be good man
like i almost feel like if i went to
somebody's funeral and they played
fireflies by owl city i would be like oh
come on
i'd be like i know they're dead but
really
they had to punish us one last time with
come on
i will say you know when i was in high
school i had talked many times about
like oh man if i
was so bright in here dude
like oh if i if i die like what song do
i want to have played at my funeral
and then like the answer i came to
is like i don't really care
like you know i'm freaking dead i don't
know
play whatever you want to play
i don't want you to play like some weird
song that i actually like
and then like you know my aunt who i've
spoken to
four times in my entire life is gonna be
like whoa this song's like kind of weird
like let's just save everybody the
trouble and why don't you just play like
the wind beneath my wings or something
like that like you were gonna do anyway
right like just
just put on the the classic funeral song
uh funeral cd and like hit shuffle and
whatever it lands on just
you know just go with it
crazy far frog nightcore squeeze
i don't know what i would play honestly
we could we could really punish him you
get you could play like only skin by
joanna newsom is 16 minutes and 15
seconds long
and then then we'll see who really is
sad that i
died as soon as i see people start to
check their watch i'll be like oh uncle
john
okay i see
sorry did you have somewhere to be i
just didn't know this funeral was gonna
take so long
and disturbed like his father look at
who he has to look up to
is joanna newsom the new steely dane
excuse me steely dan is the new steely
dame
i don't wanna pick up dirty mind
no more but i'd should like to pick up
dirty mind
oh yeah oh man classic
classic song computer play
steely dan dirty work
what's this year's steely dan summers
steely
i don't know i'm really into the beta
band right now
it doesn't have like a it doesn't have a
snippy name yet
i did find out because i said i don't i
i said
i like super but it's like a
little weird that like there's some
songs where he's like don't you
look at my girlfriend and then there's
some songs where he just sounds like a
normal guy
and then people were like hey did you
know that there's two singers in that
band and i was like what
[Laughter]
you blew my mind man i actu i thought it
was just one dude with two voices
i'm not joking cause like like axel rose
does that
sometimes he's like and then sometimes
he's like i gotta ba
bear i didn't realize that that super
 was a two
a two singer situation i thought it was
just an axle rose type situation
yeah mike patton's like that too
exactly two singer marty to marty band
the mic of the marty exactly
no oh i knew what was coming down dude i
knew it was i i just saw the shot
from the fly go up into outer space and
like it took so long to fall that i i
didn't know what was happening that was
so
need to confess scary sins and become
saved
let his light inside you cleanse you
no mom i won't no colonel sanders your
mom
i'm trying to think of songs that i've
even heard at funerals
i can't even remember definitely i've
never been at a funeral and been like oh
this is a cool song
it is i think the wind beneath my wings
i have heard for sure
i think maybe hallelujah as well
friday night thinking that
we just might run away just jump
they don't know who we are
now i'm driving shotgun in your car we
drive through the city like explorers
going 65
swept hair goes across your face we
left on friday now it's saturday
it's it is it's a catchy song man
i wonder if anyone's ever had like the
space jam theme song played at their
funeral
it's gotta be right like law of large
numbers
he's so freaking tanky dude
oh my god
oh oh oh oh hey hey easy easy
bro that this it's not necessarily a sad
story someone could die of old age and
then just be really into space jam
probably like some of these people in
chat
either they die they might die in like
20 90 and be like good get
get up with slam
saved saved
work that body work that body yet make
sure you don't hurt nobody
no no i haven't really thought about it
i know i said i wouldn't do this but
probably i'd leave instructions to play
something very self-indulgent
this is kind of humorous to me the idea
that like
you'd be like dead and looking down and
watching like all your old relatives
have to listen to like you know
peace bone by animal collective or
something like that and they're like
crying but then
panda bears just in the background going
like that
i work in the work of the work i like
what can i work with i'm working there
okay slash marker he's not done it
again



we're gonna try to do the unthinkable
today
uh forget this one okay this let's just
say there
there's a video that uh has been deleted
because we had uh
let's call it a little bit of a baby uh
what complications this morning not in a
negative way just a
a very very fussy baby where i eated a
video halfway through because i was like
my my my role as a father is more
important than my role as an actual uh
gamer right now
um so we're gonna try to do
lost either
we're gonna do lost alt
path or we're gonna do lost
true ending i'm trying to get my brain
set up right here
either way we're gonna try to do one of
those to
to achieve greatness and i'm excited i'm
excited
new emotes are heavy pog thank you i'm
sure drac will be happy
to hear that i'm happy to hear that as
well
just this card i would like a trinket
please
i could also see forever if you don't
mind
clip farming what's the clip farming i
don't understand what do you mean clip
farming
that's cracking open a cold one it can
be a can of whatever you want like
some of you guys obviously have never uh
drank beans
before uh and honestly like i worry
about your your gut biome health as a
result of that but what do i know
look at this man yeah maybe i'm open up
opening up a can of whoop a
you know what i mean i'm not talking
about when the newlywed game is on tv
but in the 1950s you weren't allowed to
say
the word s-e-x so you had to say make
whoopi instead
and then bob eubanks
says what's the weirdest place you've
ever made whoopee and he thinks you're
gonna say something like the backseat of
your car but instead the lady goes
in the butt classic tv moment
a classic tv moment
good game show have they ever brought
the newlywed game bank that's the kind
of game show i think could still work in
2021
god like give me a a little bit of uh
like the newlywed game instead of giving
me like another
show where if you answer 17 questions
right or
like they spin uh a wheel and
try to play pictionary or something like
that what about a just a cool game show
where if you win you get like a
combination washer dryer or something
like that you know what i mean
why does it always have to be uh
why does it always have to be trivia or
pictionary i got nothing wrong with
trivia but still
let's make a deal let's make a deal is
okay but
it it does the um the game show sin for
me of being on at like 11
i got to watch a couple of episodes of
wayne brady's let's make a deal when the
baby was still uh
quite young i mean she's still quite
young obviously but she she's on a
little bit more of a schedule now
um you know we don't have a key so that
makes my decision pretty easy
take it down here
is there a there's a game show in my
country where you answer trivia
questions and then you play tetris
it's been running forever that's kind of
cool you know what i'm willing to send
it here i'm not willing to take that
though
um i do like game shows
i just think that like north american
and for that matter canadian game shows
tend to be very uninspired i think they
have like the highest burn rate of uh
of any type of show that you can see out
there no i think
look here's my thinking about that deal
with the devil right like sack alter is
okay but i
i don't want to lose serif him it's
pretty okay as well and i don't want to
lose uh
the the tainted d6 i think it's a pretty
solid item underrated
so i want to either reroll until we get
something worthwhile in the deal with
the devil or
if it disappears then it's very simple
we'll just hope for uh
angel deals in the future you gotta
think about your future man
what about uh oh uh well uh-oh uh
aired in about 1998 to 2001
so it's been 20 years since that show
was on the air and also it was made for
like nine-year-old kids
so i liked it at the time uh
however i do i think maybe the time has
come for us to
invent another one perhaps
yeah this is regular lost
hey annel how do you feel about
pepperoni
um it's
maybe the best pizza topping it's
certainly up there it's in conversation
for the best pizza topping let's put it
at that
all right let's leave it at that i
should say i'm going to go in here and
try to buy a key
then we can go to we can get everything
out of this um
i will say oh that's pretty solid too i
will say i think it's a little
overrated as
a uh as a sandwich
meat like eating an entire
oh that's another reroll happening right
there oh man you know i can't possibly
but on the other hand let's do it
um as a as a sandwich
helper i think is pretty good
you know if you have like a like a
little if you have turkey is like your
base ingredient and then you throw in
like a little pepperoni as a flavor
enhancer i think it's okay but if you
have a sandwich that's like just
pepperoni it starts to make me a little
sick
but i'm not against it man i'm not
against it
okay just give me one moment here can
you believe it it's friday again
yeah i'm trying to get uh i i i got the
david lynch meme that people sent me on
twitter
we could use that for friday i also do
have um
friday night by tim robinson lined up in
the twitter account so
i i do know it's friday when it's friday
that's an all-stats upgrade now so we'll
you know
like i okay i'm gonna i'm gonna take
this
but i'm only taking this to get the deal
with the devil precedent
give me the all stats upgrade it's
actually quite sizeable
what is your opinion on kimchi and
sauerkraut um i'm for them both
like them both
full stop the end i will say
so i like uh cabbage kimchi
i mean there's more than one cabbage
kimchi but you know like in in general
as a theme i like it
but then there's also like a lot of
frick if i had known this existed we
might have played it a little different
[Laughter]
let's drop the trinket and try to go alt
path okay that's that's how we're going
to play this one oh you know what we can
just go back and re-roll because it's
still open okay
all right and you know lesson learned um
however there's a lot of kimchi
that is not that common
in north america this is actually pretty
sweet as well we finally get bookworm
actually dude i mean like the
invincibility is incredible
but on the flip side like i would
if we could somehow just get this to
reroll into regular items even though
the odds are so low
i would be really stoked we're getting
super lucky with the
the battery charges and the re-rolls um
but yeah like for example sometimes the
korean food that we get comes with uh
like green onion kimchi and it's it's
just the green
part of the green onion um so like the
the leafy
part uh and we uh
it's just that with kimchi spices and
seasonings on it it's delicious
obviously you know there's a lot of
different uh radish kimchi
you know there's gat dugi which is
delicious and then there's don muji
which is like the yellow
uh pickled radish i don't really like
don muji but
i like gatooki a lot
okay we're probably just a couple of
a couple of rolls away here this is
pretty exciting
15 books we're getting there we're
getting there
yeah the lost cannot have any health
they can respawn as a character with
health i guess but apart from that
you're just you know what you see is
what you get
radish is just in general is just
underrated i think
like as a kid it was always like this
weird like acidic vegetable
that they'd serve you like a little on a
salad or like
maybe uh like with thanksgiving dinner
they'd give you some sliced radish or
something like that but you
it's actually it's just kind of like uh
trying to think of a way to describe
radish it's kind of like a
a sow a musty cucumber but in a good way
i know it sounds pretty bad but as a fan
of cucumber i'm like uh
i like it kinda you know that's a good
way if
if you boil it it's kind of like a like
a potato yeah i
but you can actually eat it like raw
whereas a potato raw
tastes like eating like dish soap or
something like that
yeah maybe kind of like a spicy apple
there you go
okay we'll just send it again hey dude
one of them still existed that's fine by
me
um i guess we do want to deal with the
devil from the boss we've gotten super
lucky with these
have you ever tried endives uh i i've
eaten
endives many times but i don't really
uh like them
i'm still working on it but i don't
really like them
i find them kind of uh
i don't know like i love bitterness but
they're kind of like too bitter for me
most of the time
i think it maybe it's just one of those
things that's an acquired taste and i
have not acquired it yet
let me see what we got going on here i
actually hate this item
i'm sure it probably gives you huge
positives
[Laughter]
like i'm sure it gives you double the
rewards but just the fact that it gives
you it overwhelms me with choice let's
put it that way i think it lowers my
odds by overwhelming me with choice
and removing my brain fuel that i could
use later
dude this might actually get us there
i'm stunned
that's crazy i mean how many we've gone
through like i think we've gone through
12 books and we started
did we had one on the last floor on the
deal with the devil
it's possible not guarantees but
why not reroll the item room instead
sometimes um
doing uh the right thing all the time is
boring and
instead like adhering to this like
ridiculous investment that we've already
made here is more funny just to see if
it could pay out into something
hilarious
that's that's my take on the subject i
you know i have a fatal flaw
as a streamer i'm committed to being
entertaining instead of just being a
vessel for perfect play
it's hard you know i i wish it weren't
the case
it seems actually pretty solid
seems kind of amazing honestly um i'll
just take glaucoma like
it's not it's not good but seems
genuinely way better here
what's the best kind of stovetop burner
in your opinion
uh i i can't answer that question
because i don't know how to
how to answer it whatsoever um
however what i will say
is that i am a bottom right burner
guy pans go on
like the main thing that i'm cooking if
i'm sauteing or frying
goes in the bottom right burner the
bottom left
is reserved for the side whether that be
you know sauteed vegetables or maybe
there's like a pot
cooking some pasta or some rice or
something like that
anybody that uses the burners at the
back
by defaults i have some serious
questions to ask
about why you would willfully make your
life harder
like you have to reach over another
burner to get to the burner with the
stuff
on it just seems like it just seems
backwards
i don't get it
okay i do get this though that's
something pretty you know what this is a
guaranteed 10 luck forever which is also
kind of amazing
um and we'll just keep moving on
absolutely
i use opposite corners i i can sort of
see a value for opposite corners
much much like i don't understand the
back burner um
as a primary i mean if you've got three
things cooking you got no choice right
but
if if you do like in a in a vertical
column
like maybe you've got your uh
we gotta try a re-roll man we got a good
chance to use it would you look at that
um it did not create a wisp though i
have noticed that
if you if you're like bottom right cooks
the main and top right
cooks the side like that's just crazy
like that's that's
objective like the objectively i should
say
the weirdest way to cook
i can't even imagine
that's probably fair once once the baby
can reach the pans maybe we want to move
them a little further back
or alternatively maybe we'll move them
even further forward and she can cook us
dinner
to pay it forward for a change we've
been cooking her all these dinners
this time finally she's i mean come on
she's like seven months old now almost
it's time for for her to start pulling
her weight in this household
all i'm saying is she's got to change a
lot of my diapers before we
uh before we break even on that one
is nursing considered cooking hey i
wasn't talking about nursing i was
talking about cooking the food that
makes the
thing that gets nursed
which is probably the harder job right
you think so
maybe i gotta say i was skeptical
um just chill on that one last night
like the the hello fresh that i cooked
was like an asian kale salad but get
this
had crumbled beyond beef on it and i was
like i think this might be horrible
i i've had beyond burgers before but uh
i thought maybe it wouldn't stand up as
a ground beef i gotta be honest it
actually
turned out pretty well i was surprised
to see how well it uh
how well it did okay so the libraries
have now become double item rooms to
answer your questions from earlier
neither of these are that good and i
have no loss aversion let's roll them
i don't know what you are some kind of
red bag so
so welcome to the party pal
i will re-roll all of these and
everything else on the ground
f
had korean bbq last night for the first
time ever undercooked everything and now
my stomach hates me
f f in chat please
you know i feel for you
genuinely i am i am kind of laughing
though because we've had
kate and i went to korean barbecue once
um with people that had never
done korean barbecue and they kept like
in my opinion they were asking like a
bunch of questions to the waitress that
just kind of made me laugh they're
they're like excuse me how long do you
cook the meat for and kate and i were
just like
it's just kill till you till it turns
color you know
it's it starts red and when it turns
brown that's when it's ready to go
but i didn't uh apparently it's actually
uh
maybe maybe that's the reason they
printed in the menu oh we got
enemies in here
i've walked oh my god i almost stood
still in there too i was glancing at
chad
it is a meal that um
i mean i i wouldn't say you need to know
how to cook to to cook korean barbecue i
would i would say you need to
i mean like you don't need to be a
gourmet chef but you do need to have
some knowledge i suppose of like
when meat is done if anything though i'm
kind of surprised you undercooked it i
feel like most people
if they were going out to eat korean
barbecue for the first time they would
be more
and that's pretty good they would be
more concerned
about um
food safety and would just overcook it
until it was like burnt to oblivion but
thank you why am i playing you you don't
have anything for me what am i doing
here
yeah just oh but we can get a reroll no
we can't cause we're done with the floor
you stink
yeah the lost can only take one deal
okay i think it's worth a try you're
flat
anyway i sometimes though i'll admit i
you it's based on
like uh why not
it's based on your hunger level as well
right like like levy says danger levels
like oh if you'll excuse me i'll just
leave my money behind for no reason
if you're very hungry
you're more likely to take a chance on
it too i've eaten some
some meat from korean uh barbecue places
that was
probably a little bit more pink in the
middle than it should have been and i
just said you know what
eating four seconds faster is worth the
percentage chance of uh
spending two days on the toilet throwing
up and pooping myself
which is definitely not true i think
that's probably the experience of
someone who's never had a serious bout
of food poisoning
um but until i
get punished in vivo i'm gonna continue
to just have that sense of superiority i
think
let's check it out let me out please
thank you
we can't do the food poisoning bit for
like the 100th time every time it comes
up i've explained myself
i believe there's even been a toasty
video on the subject
someone in the youtube comments i i and
i i didn't want to light him up
but i was talking about how i don't
think i could do the pepsi challenge
like that vod
finally made its way to youtube and then
somebody was like this guy really does
have a bad palette which i actually
think is fine i've said it a billion
times
i think i everybody thinks they're a
super taster i think i am a sub taster i
think i taste
less than the average person which is
why i like strong flavors
you know i don't like foods that are
like for the most part that are like
gentle
and uh you know oh it's so delicate i'm
like please hit me with like uh
like a nuclear wave of of flavor
um then somebody in the comments said is
it possible that he
has covid and that's why he doesn't have
the ability to distinguish these like
because pepsi and coke are so different
the only explanation is that he must
have coveted right now and his only
symptom
is uh not being able to taste things and
uh i mean i i just had to leave
it you may take it as a clap back i take
it instead as like just the
honest-to-goodness truth
i i replied yeah i'm sure covet is the
reason i failed the pepsi challenge as
an 8th grader in 2002.
and i haven't seen what the reply to the
reply is
but maybe i'm a true long-hauler and
i've i've merely been suffering
maybe i'm patient zero for covid i got
it on my eighth grade graduation trip
when we went to see a toronto blue jays
game
and we saw the lion king at the princess
of wales theater
i just wanted you to be aware that maybe
okay sorry we're moving on um no thank
you although
no thank you no thank you okay it
happens it happens
we don't like this item we think it
stinks we think it's flat it has no
talent
i was i was in eighth grade in 2002.
i graduated from elementary school
in uh in 2002.
and graduated from high school in 2006
was kind of weird for me is like
2006 almost seems like it's more history
than 2002. i don't know if that makes
any sense at all
obviously like mathematically it doesn't
make any sense but it just like in my
head
like 2006 feels like a more different
time than 2002. i don't know how to
explain it
maybe it's because in 2006 i was a
student and in both 2021
and 2002 i spend most of my time playing
computer games
now that i think about it that might
that might be a rational explanation
okay there's a that's a stat upgrade
baby
um i don't know what you do but you're
cool so i'll probably pick you up
not a stat upgrade baby
i was actually thinking about it like
um are polo shirts cool
let me preface this by saying yes i know
like one particular brand
is now like the proud boys uniform or
whatever but like polo shirts were like
if you were going to a nice place and
you were like
holy mental holy mantle if you were
going to a nice place and you were like
between the ages of
let's say 16 and 25 at around the time
that i was 16 and 25
um you would wear a polo shirt
or you would wear a button-up shirt and
not tuck it into your jeans right
so why not why not look at that luck man
so inspirational so yesterday like i
went out for a nice long walk but the
weather was beautiful
i don't wanna it's not quite t-shirt
weather but it's definitely not like
heavy hoody weather
so i didn't know what to do and i put on
a polo shirt
and i gotta say i felt like i was
looking pretty fresh i felt like i was
looking like an amateur golfer
but i did then this could just be me but
i did sort of feel like i was getting
some looks from people that are like hey
man
like why are you wearing that thing
like are polos cool enough
are they still all right i don't know
because i chet hayes told me i can't
wear sperry's anymore
i don't even know what they are but i'm
just i wasn't aware there were so many
rules
polos are classic you're all good let's
go
appreciate it appreciate it it's either
polos or the
the garish uh team canada tokyo 2021
summer olympic jean jacket merchandise
so
i mean i i gotta make a curse of choice
one way or another
a few times over the past couple of days
uh people have been like has nl talked
about the team canada uniforms
and i was like how bad could they be i
looked them up last night they
are they're truly horrendous
doesn't do anything for us but it's nice
to see it
it's and i know that sometimes like
ugly clothes are cool um it's
it's gone so far in the opposite
direction is to be so ugly
it's uncool again i think
it's really bad the only thing i like
about it is that on the back of the
jersey it has like
on the back of the jean jacket it has a
graffiti
tokyo but it it the font is so bad it
looks like it says toxic
and i'm kind of like you know that is
got me
if there was one reason i would buy it a
jean jacket that says
toxic on the back of it is kind of cool
but i'm not sure i'm willing to
i'm going to shell out 180 bucks for
possibly the worst piece of clothing
i've ever seen anyway
that's what i read at first i'm telling
it's bad
it's it is not good guppy's tale
please wear it on stream
[Laughter]
i mean it's kind of like we because kate
and i went to the the
winter olympics in south korea in 2018
so we got a little bit of the merch for
that
i think that merge still looks pretty
good and sometimes i mean in vancouver
you see people wearing like 2010
olympic merch all the time because it
was in the city um
and people are still you know they're
kind of flexing they're like yeah i've
been here for 10 years or whatever
um i think any anytime i see someone
wearing the 2018 merch i feel like
almost we're kindred spirits i'm like i
don't know if you were there but like
you know maybe you were there and we
were there too isn't that cool
if i ever see somebody wearing this i
don't know what i'm gonna do
i'm gonna cross the street probably
something's wrong
yeah those vancouver mittens were like
insanely popular
i just remember the first time i ever
remember olympic merch popping off
it was the 1998 nagano olympics
why not right uh and those little like
i don't even know what you would call
them it's like kind of like a
beret but backwards became super popular
it's the first time i ever have heard of
the the company named roots
all right we're ready to go we're ready
there were a lot of cool hats from my
youth man that 1998 nagano olympic hat
there was a long period of time where
everybody was wearing the weird
jester cap that looks like a comet's
tail also worn by
uh the best friend of the bully in the
movie a christmas story
um
there was a brief period of time around
the first few
periods first few seasons of survivor
where you would go to school and people
would be wearing official survivor buffs
that was a weird one okay don't forget
to teleport out
don't forget to grab dead sea scrolls
and then do a double re-roll here
i had a survivor buff my grandma got one
for me probably like in the year
2000
pog active contrition
tears up you feel forgiven and the relic
okay
the moon was it pagong or togo
it was light blue that's what i i feel
like in my head
season uh
season three of survivor was going on
but i can't say that for certain
donkey donkey donkey donkey
i mean i remember season one was won by
richard hatch
season two was won by
tina who went on to be the star of the
rob schneider movie the animal
you know on second thought just saying
that sentence i would like to take back
where i said that the early 2000s feel
closer to the modern day than 2006 does
i believe episode season 3 was won by
ethan a man with curly hair who may have
been a professional soccer player
and i think that was the last season of
survivor i ever watched
i remember there was like rupert i know
who rupert is
i remember that this the season that
rupert was on
everyone was like rupert rupert rupert
but i did not watch that season
that's one of my that's one of the
memories that helps me anchor
where my survivor experience ended is
that i have never seen rupert play
survivor
back in my rupert no no no back in my
day
we stand rudy
the 75 year old american military vet
who got tricked in the final three
they they pulled a dan giesling on him
and said hey if you just take your hand
off of the immunity idol don't worry we
won't vote you out and then they voted
him out
bro this this stinks i hate it here
i'm just gonna bomb my way out man
coward baited
have they ever done a survivor in
antarctica that was like all the
discourse on the playground when i was a
kid is like if they really wanted to do
a real survivor they should do it in
antarctica
i figured they would have done it by now
if they were ever gonna do it but
someone would actually die
yes but it would be for the
entertainment of
you know tens of millions of people so
you probably you know that i mean you
just gotta get him to sign a waiver or
whatever right
have we gotten the damage upgrade didn't
it last like seven floors
i feel like we have the best defensive
run of all time and none of the
items that we got actually matter
because we're playing as the lost to
begin with
[Laughter]
oh no it's perfect comedic timing i told
you
i think we shouldn't have taken libra
that's that's my my
in hindsight i think we shouldn't have
taken libra i also think if we played as
any other character we would have easily
destroyed that entire run but anyway
slash marker an
attempt was made
all right we're running it back
i love playing as a lost anyway i mean
now we should call that one the greatest
book of all time
what are the best reality shows from
that era i mean i i really like um
i mean i think survivor and big brother
are classics i think the amazing race is
is cool as well um
because it's amazing races just like
it's like just travel and
stunts you know hold our i don't think
so
this is a pretty good item man
but then also like the mole i thought
was super cool it was a nice little
uh inversion on the formula where there
was like i shot him
there's like a little social deduction
alongside the uh
normal reality tv show stuff uh
saved
trying to remember what else there was i
mean the joe schmo show was kind of
interesting
where like one person on the show was a
real person
and the other 11 people were actors and
it was i'm alive
it was meant to be like big brother
but it was also a social experiment and
then also um
that's actually pretty good there was
another similar show called joe
millionaire
where it was the bachelor but they told
all the prospective
women that the uh they were competing to
uh you know marry a guy who was like a
multi-millionaire but then it turned out
he was just like a normal dude
i don't remember what happened in that
one but
uh i do remember that
from from the best of my memory like
the lady was pretty unhappy and i always
thought it was like
kind of even as a kid i was like it's a
little weird
that like we're supposed to be like oh
like this lady
um you know it turns out she was just
after the guy for his money and you're
like
yeah i mean like that was the the
casting call i'm assuming for the entire
show
which was like hey do you want to try to
marry this rich guy
like obviously she's not on the show
trying to find real love she's on the
show to try to get like
either a wealthy husband or
alternatively
to get her acting career off the ground
in case this show becomes like the most
popular show in the world
you're supposed to be like will they
actually be in love and i would be like
i don't know man
i think she's got a pretty good point
the entire relationship was built on a
lie
so like i i mean if i put myself in her
shoes i think i would be a little
annoyed as well
quite frankly
it's like you started it's like mr deeds
man they you know
they started dating under a false
pretense
oh you're not wrong it is a beautiful
day in vancouver today that's why we had
the discussion on polo shirts so i could
figure out if they're okay to wear
he did you're not wrong and mr deeds
john turturro did have a very cool foot
like it was it it was insanely cool i.e
it was cold uh i believe he was climbing
mount everest or something he got you
got frostbite
something along those lines i can't
remember
i finally watched the origin story of
cannicorn
and i'm like i'm mad now because it is
not funny
i believe it's just joey diaz in the
longest yard getting hit by a
devastating tackle and then saying can
of corn and i'll be fine
it's just like
i i liked it more when i thought malph
had invented it i guess
is what i'm trying to say
okay please good deal with the devil
well well well what do we have here
i would describe this as a good deal
with the devil absolutely
reality is often disappointing oh hello
good morning
you can i don't think you should get on
camera in your
loose pajamas though i'm just trying
i'm just trying to maintain some decorum
here
what's what's the weird dream so you
changed all the furniture around the
hole okay
okay so i'm just keeping it posted for
for chad
um i changed all the furniture in kate's
dream
and for the baby's bed i gave her a low
table
kate was upset in the dream
she said the baby cannot sleep on that
low table
seems fair
dream dream me trusted the doctors and
said that the doctors
said it was the safest place for a baby
to sleep
kate said i'm not letting the baby sleep
on this low table
that's the end of the dream
you say fu i was just trying to do what
was best for the baby
[Laughter]
well while you were having that dream i
was uh
trying to shove six pierogies into my
mouth before my
like seven or eight hour long stream
today uh while the baby was just
angrily weeping on my shoulder and i was
just trying to like
vibe so that maybe i could like let her
know that everything was gonna be okay
so i'm i'm sorry for how uh dream me
was acting
um i don't know that's this seems like
uh
it seems a little bit like victim
blaming if dream me behaved i would have
woken up earlier
i can't remember what i dreamed i think
i was i think i had a good dream
i usually i dream about like basic stuff
i dream about like eating
like brunch on the patio and stuff like
that
i'm not gonna apologize either i think
it's pretty cool
like something i'll wake up and i'll
look at the clock and it'll be like 4am
and i'll be like oh man i was having
tapas
tapas cd oh i'm dead i'm simply
i'm alive
don't hit me i'm so stupid i'm still
alive though
um re-roll i don't want it give me a
battery charge please
saved can of corn
he's lived
what are tapas
chad first you you undercook the korean
barbecue so bad you give yourself
salmonella
now you don't even know what tapas are
yeah they're like shareable
uh appetizers in spanish cuisine
that's what i was saying they were like
nl thanks for streaming
i got korean barbecue for the first time
last night undercooked the crap out of
it and now my stomach hurts
and on the one hand i was like i feel
for you and also thank you for your
comments but also like
you just turn it there you just cook it
till it turns brown
we do things a little different here
tapas of the morning to you exactly all
right
heroes medal also known as consolation
prize it will give
us i think it's going to give us damage
look at that i don't i have no idea what
the mechanism of this item is because it
says it gives you the lowest
i bet it's just the lowest stat relative
to your starting stat
i i just thought i was a genius and like
my brain figured out the formula somehow
without
letting my actual conscious mind know
okay i will
she fell asleep in your arm oh she's
chilling right there
hey hey baby
oh my god her cheeks are so rosy
goodbye baby love you too
all right this run is like in an
amazing spot
lux's looking good we got pretty flies i
didn't die going to the
uh curse room which is a good start for
me now we're free to talk about crazy
time yeah yeah
nah kate is way more likely to be in the
crazy time than me
i'm not putting up a uh of a front
when i say that i just derived no
pleasure from gambling
she did watch some of the chip stream i
mean i can't just make the brunt of my
commentary for the third day in a row
how good the crazy time stream was but
still not good
i mean it's a different story like
don't know because people are like says
the guy who likes to reroll this whole
run and isaac
yeah but it's kind of different because
like i don't know that's fun
i don't i know that that it's kind of
like species reasoning you know but like
like it's like you know it has
meaningful consequences for like the
the quality of a run when you re-roll it
like that
in you know so much of the casino is
just like
hey pick uh five three or seven then
you're like a three and they're like
sorry
buddy it's five and you're like oh man
that wasn't fun at all
all right pick three five or seven all
right this time i pick five
guess what buddy it's five
here's two times your money back i'll be
like oh this is amazing
that's why they have visual aspects yeah
but like i don't know like so many of
the visual aspects are like
they look so cheesy like i'm i'm always
and every time in my head when i think
of las vegas it's like you know
luck be a lady tonight
luck be my they you know you get the
idea
and then when you go there it's actually
just like prison break slot machine
i got seven wentworth millers in a row i
i got thirty five dollars
i don't want batteries i okay why not
nl i'm going through my dad's recipe
book why
is every recipe from the 80s and 90s
inundated with references to sun-dried
tomatoes
i'm gonna uh answer your question with
another question how old do you think i
am um
i i did not i was born in 1988
and moreover did not start cooking until
minimum the mid-2000s
so i don't have uh a primary source with
which to answer your question
as as a contemporary adult
i would say i mean i like sun-dried
tomatoes
i do enjoy them oh fried green tomatoes
was a movie
yeah and like you could not escape it
people would not shut up about it i
don't even like i was like
four or five when it came out but like
definitely my mom my grandma and like
all my aunts
were like fried green tomatoes so go
have you seen fried green tomatoes they
wouldn't
it's like that and legends of the fall
i think it's because they were all just
like you know they had a they had a big
crush on brad pitt
i don't remember what this does but
let's let's snag it man i mean that's an
amazing item as well
brad armpit don't call him brad armpit
okay
because you know why because i watched
moneyball while i was cooking dinner
last night
and i i always forget even though i
literally just watched it like less than
a year ago how good that movie is
stop calling him brad armpit we're gonna
have some problems
favorite brad pitt movie man that's it's
a tough question
i genuinely think he's like i don't
think this is controversial in the
slightest
i think that he's possibly like the
most accomplished living male actor
12 monkeys great movie fight club
you know misinterpreted but great movie
moneyball amazing movie big
short once upon a time in hollywood
snatch
like
i would like to get infamy if i could
but
burn after reading
seven yeah do i mean he's been okay sure
mr and mrs smith
the assassination of jesse james by the
coward robert ford
i've never seen it but i've heard it's
incredible the oceans movies
i mean like
i think he's up there man dicaprio's up
there too but dicaprio he takes on a lot
less work which i think gives him the
advantage in in terms of like selection
right
it's the cowards approach also known as
daniel day-lewis approach
if you only pick good movies then of
course your filmography is going to look
great
what if you just take a lot of movies
and then make them good instead
it's still not that good no robert de
niro
per capita has
uh probably an above average filmography
but has like some
he's got a lot of stinkers in there as
well
not saying brad pitt's never been in you
know some bad movies but
as he's gotten older his filmography has
trended up i would say
he's one of the very few actors out
there where i would be like this movie
stars
uh brad pitt i would be more likely to
see it
like i i saw ad astra in theaters for
two reasons
it has outer space in the movie which is
an easy sell for me
and then it also starred brad pitt now i
did not really
think that it was an enjoyable movie um
but even still i was like that's not
brad's fault it's because the
filmmaker was extremely pretentious but
you know
yeah and don't even get me started on
daniel day lewis he's like i only take
good movies
then uh my dude was in lincoln so
explain yourself
what about tommy lee jones i i wouldn't
judge i guess an actor by their worst
movies tommy lee jones has been
in some really good stuff but all i can
think of when i think of tommy lee jones
is
uh the movie man of the house
where he has to protect a sorority of
university of texas
cheerleaders from the mafia for some
reason
also stars cedric the entertainer and uh
the cheerleaders i mean it's the classic
tommy lee jones movie right
by the way have we left to drink it
behind but it's it's the classic uh
tommy lee jones uh
movie where like he's grumpy but then
the people that he plays off of are like
happy-go-lucky
so they go um where's your happy face
and then tommy lee jones with his
trademark grimace goes this is my happy
face
it's a it's an all-time classic
uh film all-time classic
okay take me down to the next floor
jake gyllenhaal's up there al pacino
don't even
don't even get me started on al pacino
man
uh this is insanely great al pacino
again al pacino been in some great
movies
um also been in some absolute garbage
i'm not even holding like jack and jill
against al pacino i'm i'm
because you know i mean if adam sandler
calls you up and is like
hey do you want to like make fun of
yourself in my movie even if
if i were in al pacino's shoes i think i
would say why not you know
it'll be fun i'm old it's not like it's
gonna really affect my like prestige
you know and anybody that's like this is
embarrassing for al pacino myself
included
is gonna be like you know who cares you
know you're a little snob
however i'm more hold al pacino like
i hold him in lower regard for movies in
the early 2000s such as simone
and also um the recruit starring colin
farrell
and he also i believe he won best uh
actor at the oscars for
um scent of a woman which is just a
just an asinine film i i hate it
he plays a uh a blind man with very
strong opinions
who uh it's kind of like a driving
miss daisy thing but instead of
you know driving miss daisy al pacino
is miss daisy and he's blind and he
spends the whole movie going
hoo hoo wow i
know really i don't think the who i just
like it's like a caricature
of of good acting like it's he
don't get me wrong he left it all on the
on the table but
wait he left nothing on the table
that's what i meant to say
okay unicorn stump is incredible
anyway i yeah i mean i got nothing
against al pacino using some great stuff
as well
it's you know i'm gonna give it one try
i'm gonna give it one try
but i mean if we're i mean brad pitt is
absolutely in a higher echelon than some
actors being mentioned here like val
kilmer come on man like i got nothing
against val kilmer
if anything i have something against you
making me do a comparative analysis
between
brad pitt's filmography and val kilmers
he was like you know he was in top gun
he was in tombstone
he was in batman and then he played uh
the bad guy
in mcgruber sure don't get me wrong he's
good in like kiss kiss bang bang
but uh but come on man
he is in heat you're not wrong he is in
heat
i didn't get the card oh my god dude i
didn't get oh my god
oh my god i didn't get the skull oh my
god he start talking about
phil kilmer you know what that's fine
because we're gonna get a teleport item
on boss rush then we're gonna go through
all of boss rush and we're gonna
we're gonna get a teleport item when we
finish boss rush and it's all gonna
come out okay here
the wall master could have grabbed you
as well i suppose that's true
alexander hamilton
there's a chance if we if we ever see
another wall master i swear on my life i
will slay them
not not not okay fallen
very spooky
not mentioning scarface come on man um
moneyball is better than scarface full
stop okay every everyone's shouting
cursed eye dude cursed eye
okay explain to me step by step how
we're gonna use cursed eye to get out of
this room without dying
if i get hit the first hit will not use
cursed eye the second hit will kill me
before i teleport
sometimes you just got to do things the
hard way when you forget to do them the
easy way
i'm still optimistic like this is clip
farming
no matter what i'm not going to deny
that but sometimes
you you got to believe and i believe
we're going to get a teleport item here
if we don't we're probably gonna hold r
no
we'll send it because with mom's knife
the run will be like super
uh super fast
this is an honest question and i i don't
think this necessarily proves anything
i'm just saying for
like interest sake what's what's got a
higher rating on imdb scarface or
moneyball
i'm not even going to go to rotten
tomatoes because i already know rotten
tomatoes is going to have money ball at
like a 91 in scarface at like a 75
but i imdb let's see what the populace
says
they got scarface higher all right what
are the scores
what are i just i'm again i'm not
disagreeing i'm just interested in
knowing
give me give me the comparative scores
scarface is
8.3 moneyball 7.6
all right now when you factor in that
there's going to be a one
point penalty on moneyball no matter
what because it's about sports
and uh film nerds don't respect
uh sports ball dae
then i think you frick
hold on skulls skulls skulls skulls
skulls skulls sculpt um
crawl space crawl space
all right well it is what it is that's
my bed
could have happened could have happened
man this takes us directly to the boss
right yeah
like i said directly to the boss
anyway al pacino
is only responsible for 30 of scarface's
rating
brad pitt is responsible for 70 of money
balls
so as a result i stand by
i stand by my case
jonah hill yeah he's okay i like i like
the part
give me a second here to shoot this uh
enemy
i like the part where jonah hill's on
the phone
just give me a moment just give me a
moment here
i like the part where jonah hill's on
the phone and he goes like
that's pretty good i honestly i think
you should have gotten the best gesture
oscar for that
is a landmark moment
i like jonah hill
i forgot how much i love moneyball i'm
gonna go re-watch it
dude this is actually like a great movie
jonah hill is the actor that is cursed
the most on the stream
or on screen i should say um false
haven't you seen a christmas story the
most uh
vulgar curse-laden moment in
history is when ralphie in a christmas
story gets a hold of his bully
and goes sergio frazier such a french
friendship fragile friendship
schedule is actually like
i i almost can't bear to watch it today
as an adult
it's it's just too violent for me
it's like i've never seen rage at that
level before
that's joe pesci in home alone hey kid i
never made it out of the sixth grade
looks like you won't neither cox gun
gets assaulted by pigeons
teleports behind you nothing personnel
kid
i don't love the movie but the scene
where santa kicks the kid down the slide
was always pretty funny for me dude
that's like a christmas
story actually upsets me because the
mall santa setup is so
good you know like
all and i'm sure this is the same for
like everybody watching this
but like the mall santas that i had
growing up you go to the center of the
mall
you wait in like a long line you sit on
some old dude's lap and then they take a
photo where you probably are like
and then you like move on right
why why hush why come on man we got we
got no reason to fight hush here we've
already unlocked that on the post you
know back in like 2018.
um but then in the christmas story
the uh
they go up like a huge staircase
and they sit on santa's lap and then
they get to go on a cool slide on the
way down
that's really neat
we didn't we never got to go down a
slide
oh my god like i told you man every time
that's that's just windows uh defender
telling me it found
no threats last time i scanned my
computer thanks for sending me uh
such an alarming sounds to tell me that
everything's fine
we just want you to know every
everything's going super well just
checking in
ring ring ring just checking in to let
you know nothing's going on
it's telling you you forgot the full
card whatever man because on the on the
chest with 11 luck i'm just gonna get
the r
key and we're gonna make this run pop
i do not like a christmas story though
i'm not saying it's a bad movie but
i've just seen it so much that i i just
have no desire to ever watch it ever
again in my entire life
the only reason i would watch it now is
because uh
every time my mom watches it whenever
ralphie comes out in the pink
bunny outfit she laughs until she cries
which is like i mean that's fun
but i'm not watching the movie for the
movie's sake i'm watching the movie
because my mom
laughs still she cries it's wholesome i
i couldn't agree more
hey have you watched the new mark
wahlberg show on uh
hbo called wall street i happen to
unfortunately be beset by it uh when i
was looking after the baby yesterday
afternoon
and i think it might actually be the
worst show in television history
and i have previously said yes mark
wahlberg has you know
in his youth done some terrible things
but also uh
i've found him as an actor to be
somewhat likable and affable
but uh this show is is
it's just a little much
he uh runs many businesses
and is uh involved in them as as
private equity funding or whatever um
but like
for some reason when it the whole show
is just clips of him being on the
telephone at all times
what are we doing come on talk to me
what's wrong
how do you feel about that why didn't
anybody tell me
you know it's just that for like an hour
but every once in a while it will also
be intercut
with uh a scene from one of his movies
that has like a small degree of
relevance to what's happening
like uh deez master thank you for the
gifted subscriptions by the way thank
you thank you
like on one of them he asked his
business partner he's like hey are you
still there
because he didn't answer him on the
phone in like two seconds
and uh it cut to a scene from what
appeared to be a uh
late period transformers film where he
said
am i speaking english right now and then
it cut back to
like him just being on the phone and i
was like who is this show made for man
like it's made for someone who's just
like so
into the mythos of mark wahlberg like
the the mark wahlberg cinematic universe
i'm like
i have no idea what this guy like
what he's doing man new kidney being
just dropped though
that's pretty good
it does explode now
oh yeah don't even get me started on the
transformers movie
movies i should say i that's one of the
few media takes where i know i'm on the
right side of history because i hated
them as soon as i
saw the first one
the wahlburg verse
yeah the first one is the one that sucks
the least as well i
i mean i only saw the first one and then
the second one and the second one i
walked out of the theater
i i got dragged to it by friends of mine
and uh i i walked out of the theater
basically just just a combination of
bored and insulted i guess i would say
first one i was like it's okay i wasn't
thr
you know it was a nice day at the movies
i got to see
uh live free or die hard followed by
transformers one and i was like you know
both of those movies are
okay i had a decent time
when i saw transformers dock of the moon
or whatever the second one is called
i remember the moment where i lost it
was when the mom goes to the college and
she's she's taking sam witwicky to the
college and she eats the pot brownie and
then the colors around her start to turn
like
psychedelic and it starts to melt and
stuff
and she's like don't try to stop me from
eating the brownie it's my cheat day and
you're like man
i mean that's it i can't be too mad but
that's when i realized at least like the
movie was not made for me
it's a movie that's made for kids
which is totally you know it's fine but
like why am i here
so i left
but i do like in that movie where they
say
they talk to the frat boys and they go
hey why don't you get a tighter shirt
and then they go
we tried they don't have any or they say
like we don't have any
or they don't have any we looked i was
like that joke's okay
i'll give him a little credit for that
joke
it was a different era
i don't get it well you had to see it
you had to be there they were wearing
very tight shirts
hello justin hello
can a corn baby what's this run's goal
um
thank you for the raid by the way justin
i will explain to your audience this
runs goal originally
many people will tell you it was to get
the tainted version of
uh the lost they are all lying to you
i only wanted this was a nice little
warm-up run for me
in order to uh just practice how to play
isaac and i did
not leave anything behind that
caused us to be forced to compromise on
this one the goal was to have fun
and we've failed we died okay slash
marker
don't watch this one
okay it's still going up on youtube
though the spice must flow



isaac all right we have approximately
40 minutes it's time to knock out
greedier mode i'm loving greedier as
like a little
is a little time killer man let's do
greedier
crazy lilith crazy
this will this will be interesting range
up
not sure how i feel about that
she do be pretty slow too but that's
okay
you know what the master of diagonal
walking is logged on
justin don't make me glance at the other
window i always type
the the check check-in for twitch rivals
manually
i don't want them to think that i'm just
uh
yeah he roasted me in the chat they give
you like a little spiel for every twitch
rivals that you have to agree to
by repeating it which honestly might
seem like overkill but i'll tell you man
having worked with streamers uh like not
just being one myself but also like for
stuff like champions assault
forcing them to actually like repeat
after you word for word is probably like
one of the smartest things that you
could do just to ensure that they've
actually
done their due diligence um not a good
start here by the way but that's fine
um i type it all out manually because i
want to make sure that i've understood
it as well
i don't i don't control c control v
right
i just walked right into it okay try
again try again
quick run can of corn can a corner and
i'll be all right can of corn i'll be
all right
okay oh hey okay thank you for the map
setup details as well
much appreciated i will thank you admin
slash marker okay here we go speed up
that's that's better
we got nothing i do no i don't copy
paste
i mean in some situations sure when
we're
talking about copying and pasting the
video description that says repentance
is finally out
yes i don't type that manually every
time if they're like please make sure
that you understand this i'm like
i don't know the copying and pasting it
almost sounds like that's like malicious
compliance for me and that's not the
kind of energy that i want to bring into
an event like that
i'll i'll do my due diligence man
look at this easiest run of my life now
that i can actually see the ground
i love malicious compliance oh it's a
it's a classic
subreddit justin it's every single story
is about how like you know there was
like a dress code at the office
but the dress code basically the spirit
of all of them is like you know there's
nothing in the rule book that says like
a dog can't play basketball
like i've got to wear closed-toed shoes
i wore shoes that were like you know
i wore boat shoes and they said those
don't count so i came in wearing like
you know
literally just toes on my shoes the next
day
and uh who was my hr representative
albert einstein and then everybody
clapped and gave me a crisp
100 dollar bill that being said i 100
believe that most of them happened
unlike our slash relationships
help help me help help me
help me
it's getting better it's getting better
kill me okay dude once that gets going
oh that's gonna be a heck of a bit kill
me
if you're watching on youtube right now
i'm so
sorry kill me
oh man that's that's gonna haunt your
dreams
that's how i felt when i saw that tim
horton's tweet yesterday that said doge
nut
oh man all right hold on we can buy
something people fall asleep to these
videos
well that's their problem i didn't i'm
i'm
why am i giving them the greatest
commentary on the entire internet
if they're just choosing to have me send
them off to dreamland doesn't make any
sense man
i had a dream that like the the weird uh
cpr dummy from the cover of radiohead's
the benz
asked me to kill him i wonder what what
could have caused that i mean let me in
the background
kill me kill me
kill me i'm getting it
i'm getting it okay hold on saved
sweet dreams youtube i didn't get a key
though that was that was unwise
i should have gotten you know what that
just means we have a chance to get a
planetarium on the next level
oh penny please penny for my thoughts
okay never mind
can i corn can a key can of key and i'll
be all right
you have to pitch up when you're doing
it hello
hello hello um
i we can't do this for the whole episode
for like five minutes no problem i
you know we shouldn't even do it at all
because i'm sure chib's gonna do it
during uh
during pummel party and it's gonna make
me laugh a lot
so and then i'll try to do it for 15
minutes and it will fail the whole time
be careful with that voice it'll destroy
your vocal cords my throat does hurt a
little bit
i will say when when i look back at
malf's tweet and realize that he was
like my throat hurts i'm not gonna
stream today i was like
i wonder what could have caused that and
then i just stopped back
to monday's rainbow six siege
session
i was like man i wondered geez what
could have possibly caused that
and that's why you always leave a note
we're gonna die
i forgot that the fun part of greedier
mode is that it never gives you any uh
consumables
we're not gonna die and we're dead
okay um you know it's just like i that
the bomb
like in my opinion kind of um you know
it seemed like they waited
until it was gonna hit me and then it
exploded
maybe just just my thinking
these are good for sure
blam
it happens this is close to holding r
you guys watch too many weak-willed
streamers
my will is like is unbelievable my
actual ability is
somewhat low
but my desire to win is
it never decays
there's a streamer who holds our every
run and right now he is 100
in repentance so what's what's your
thesis there you thought i was
not giving up uh on garbage runs because
i thought it would make
completing the game easier like
i don't understand what like what what
the own is supposed to be
obviously if you just hold r until you
start every run with something good it's
gonna be a lot easier
i don't know if you can 100 this game oh
come on
this that's just insanity
it's like saying like i don't know if
you'll be able to put like one foot in
front of the other long enough to walk
for like an hour straight
you know you just gotta you just gotta
keep putting one foot in front of the
other
it's gonna take a long time you know
what
it'll happen though
yeah the longer it takes you know
honestly the happier i am
okay this come on guys hey hey there
ladies there's enough
me to go around
don't conflate like this you know
month-long
experiment when isaac first comes out
and like everybody's playing 12 hours of
the game every single day with like
the reality you know people always they
overestimate what they can do in a small
time frame
they underestimate what they can do in a
over a long time frame
in 17 years when we get 100 on this
you're gonna be like
i'm ashamed of my words and my deeds
spikey right no load magnet tears i
think those are good
saved
dude it shredded him
yeah tough times don't last only tough
people last
you just wait man everybody is streaming
cobalt this doesn't apply to you only
the streamers
who other people were talking about that
were mean to me um
all the other streamers after they 100
repentance in like two months they're
gonna be like what do i play
i'm gonna be like what about isaac
they're gonna be like nah i already ate
all that
i'm full i'm gonna be like well you did
it you did it to yourself
you do and that's what really hurts you
did it to your
set kill me see because it's the it's a
reference to the benz okay hold on
oh if you'll excuse me i got it my
wife's sending me uh
discord messages the admin sending me
discord messages
the benz is a great album it's pretty
good
um i mean it's better than pretty good i
apologize that's that's
insubordinate and shirlish i'll admit
sure why not
i my favorite radiohead album is okay
computer all right
because i'm like built different like
that um i'm built so different i'm built
the same
but i will say you know
i would think like you know back in the
day people would be like what's your
favorite song off of kid a
and i thought i was like the normal one
you know
i'd be like yeah paranoid android is
okay but you ever
listen to whatever that track three is
called subterranean
alien blues or whatever it's called and
i'm like
people are of the opinion that song's
kind of stinky and i'm like yo you're
you're missing out man maybe it's
because you're too
uptight airbag
also pretty sick
i mean i got nothing against paranoid
android it's a great song
but then like um you know there's some
people out there who are like
paranoid androids pretty good but have
you ever heard
fitter happier more productive
more patient with my friends
like it just oh man that just it hits me
right where it
right where it hurts
cool guy boys
can't be done can't be done
you gotta get chipped to do it i i dude
i'm i'm pretty stoked for like the
energy of this twitch rivals
like i have no idea what
if if they know what they're getting
themselves into
like i think we've assembled the cast of
of possibly
like the most idiosyncratic streamers on
the platform
it is not going to be your traditional
esports vibe
and we have no media instructions
whatsoever
so and and the games are going to be
long so i think we're going to go in
some directions this should be a fun
time
i did see someone asked me yesterday if
i was gonna be in the
the power lifting twitch rivals and i
thought they were
having a laugh and then i was in the
twitch rivals discord and there was
actually like
uh like roll requests for it i was like
that's amazing
i had no idea that was a real thing
twitch rivals is popping off man
no i'm not invited also i would
definitely just hurt myself right now
if it happened like a year ago it could
have been pretty sick though
although i definitely would have lost
but uh still would have been fun i don't
know what any of you do
and one day i'll learn but this is
daniel's favorite item
that's all i need to know
just just checking just checking all the
ads man just checking all the ads
just checking all the hats just checking
all okay we're still good
we got time maybe we'll just push it a
little bit push it a little bit push it
a little bit okay
t1 only benches like 405.
405 kilograms oh
pounds oh that's no problem
thank you
now do we buy a key or do we buy oh do
red candles so good though
we'll buy it we'll start with a key
funny that's pretty good too though
serpent's kiss
do benching 405 pounds of feathers would
actually be way more impressive than
benching
405 pounds of steel i don't know how you
would gain
you know purchase on 400 pounds of
feathers that's got to be like
you know the volume of uh
of like a warehouse or something like
that yeah we all know that let me joke
okay
haha he's very funny ha ha he's he's so
funny he's a professional comedian he's
stealing all your viewers
uh he was the first person in the dad
craft server and then mr mr hollywood mr
hollywood glasgow big shot decided he's
too big to ever show up on the deadcraft
server even though he's your freaking
streaming hero it'd be really nice to
like have a conversation with him at
some point just to tell him you know how
much you enjoy his work and all that ha
ha
very funny good one good one
we've all seen it chat we've all seen it
sad gun back on back on top
i know and look so yeah this is the same
heaviness
but i will say real
talk of the realist variety
if in theory you could get a 400 pound
weight
that was the size of a ball bearing
i bet it would be easier to lift
than a 400 pound weight that was the
size of a cardboard box
i think you could just gain more
leverage on it
i think so the the size and shape of a
lift matters
like you ever see i watch the
documentary on like you know
stone lifting in iceland where they lift
these stones and they're all like
yeah like don't get me wrong like it's
heavy but also simultaneously like the
hard part is that it's just like shaped
like a freaking
like something from hp lovecraft's
nightmare
it's got sharp edges and stuff like that
any physics majors yeah physics majors
for a dollar name a simple machine
the small ball would instantly put a
hole through your hand but
it's 400 pounds i don't think it's like
made of pure magma it would have hurt
don't get me wrong i don't think it
would
it'll hold through your head
i don't know maybe it would i mean it is
pretty small
this is a lot of it's a lot of pressure
oh maybe it would i don't honestly i
think i could
i could move it off the ground i think i
could pick it up and move it off the
ground
maybe it would bruise that's all i'm
willing to admit
it would fall through the freaking floor
dude
imagine if it started rolling downhill
oh my god
you'd have to like clear a path for it
so it could keep rolling forever
otherwise you know you would the amount
of damage you would do at the end by the
way tears up you feel forgiven
you should check the shop how would you
gain purchase on it i would just put my
fingers under it and then like lift it
and then get my other hand on it
i'm willing to give you one penny that's
it
hold on just checking the uh the myriad
uh messages that pop in all the time
here
we got 25 minutes plenty of time plenty
of time can of corn plenty of time can
of corn
range up beautiful item very useful
right now
i will purchase a single key
i can't imagine that being good for us
what would happen if you swallowed the
400 pound ball bearing
you would peristalsis keep it from
ripping a hole in your
you know what
i'll tell you i'm going over to someone
else's house to to pass that one though
i don't want to have to buy a brand new
toilet
hey excuse me mouth can i use your
bathroom real quick
you're not going in there to poop out a
400-pound ball bearing into my ceramic
toilet are you
no
yes
take technology is not a damage down so
here's the thing
like i might take technology too but it
is a damage down i'll take it but i want
you to know in advance
that i am not trolled
i refuse to be trolled and i've never
been trolled
much like drew barrymore in the 1998
movie never been kissed
they've removed it check the wiki i
don't believe you
all right see never trolled
it is a tears down instead
[Laughter]
that's okay that's not that big of a
deal
it i think it did a lot for the sound
design of the run too wouldn't you
suggest like i think the ambiance is
quite nice
what'd you say
bro it sounds like there's like a wind
turbine out here it's so loud
all right this is horrible what about
just what about just this
it's much more peaceful oh my god but
the damage is so
bad
you sure this wasn't a damage downgrade
i i feel trolled despite not i mean
obviously not being trolled i feel
trolled
which is almost worse
so
we got no chance man i mean lodestone's
doing great work but i
i don't think we're uh i don't think we
got a realistic chance at the
mega greed here
help help help help me help help me
help help me
it's so miserable
um sure yeah yeah thank you all right we
lived easily
i would like to purchase binky please
i think i can he's so bright
duh binky okay he's gotten it
um you know there is a red heart back
here
there was it was right at the door okay
i was so confused
and i'll be honest a little upset but
here we go
you had nod leaf unfortunately i also
have like a call
time that's the issue with that one
okay we're taking a look it's a book
reading rainbow i don't know not leaf
could be like
or not not leaf uh lump of coal lumpa
colon i'll be all right
lump of coal could be good here maybe
maybe it does nothing actually maybe i
stepped on the button and permanently
compromised
my reward
compromise to a permanent end at this
point i'm kind of just hoping for
like i did see somebody tweeted today
somebody in the community
i apologize i don't want to get the name
wrong
but they tweeted
the trade offer meme but in relation to
isaac
and they said i receive a single damage
upgrade
please god i'm begging you you receive
me playing you for one more day
and that's kind of like i mean we had
some good runs today but that's kind of
how i feel on this run for sure
i'm like like at some point
if you could have just found it in the
goodness of your heart to give me like
anything useful that's baby pig man okay
thank you baby pig man
i mean i'm gonna be honest you like i'd
like to live but i'd also like to buy
red stew red stew
i don't think we're living here i think
we just we could die with style
this is bad maybe these guys are not so
bad okay and then you buy
you buy red stew red stew gives you a
colossal damage upgrade
temporarily you simply
use it to absolutely dominate
win easily
i mean that's a huge damage upgrade
okay i've got to tell you i i assumed
that i would be stomping enemies like
out of existence insanely quickly
it's doing pretty well but this is not
like quite on the level i was expecting
but i do appreciate the full hp
um i mean you should definitely take
book of revelations but that's a cowards
way
get me out of here
we must go insanely quickly so our
damage doesn't decay too much
no the tears i mean i i think the baby
does damage in
proportion to our damage instead so i
think the tears actually just slows down
the dps i think there's some situations
where it's definitely better but
but shooting the baby is definitely
faster killing these enemies
i also did not know until we tested it
though
flies and spiders doing good work no
more thinking just gotta go fast
our damage also keeps going up
i don't know what's causing it like it
goes down then it goes up then it goes
down then it goes up
on every kill it goes up because the
sword is kissed come on come on pop up
you freaking jerk
dude we're not losing that much
damage wise like this could actually
work
red stew gives you a damage up on kill
as well temporarily
dude that's actually amazing i had no
idea i got to stop looking down on this
item
i got to start looking it up on the wiki
okay fast fast fast fast fast we haven't
lost much um
it's pretty good is this item good i
think it's pretty good
i don't believe it we have 39 damage now
30 cents um most important item
not available here um not available
possibly available but i'm i'm risking
it
not available
available ah that was so not worth it
what am i what am i thinking just grab
one of these all right that's pretty
good
not my finest moment but you know what
we got some very good damage for the
next floor
what if what if we get mega greed to
just walk into
um
to just walk into temperance
that's a lot of damage dude
like i know the meme but also like
genuinely that's actually just like a
lot of damage
yes yes yes more flies more spiders
love the boss armor hey we love the boss
armored
love the boss armor baby
doubters in shambles yet again
and dude i'm not gonna like apologize at
all this run was actually pure garbage
we saved it with skill and skill alone
absolute madman beats greedier mode
with a single damage upgrade wow
that's gonna be one heck of a title
uh uh yeah okay two two damage upgrades
good point but like we would have beaten
it without sacred hearts so it's
technically not
false advertising
and dude i'm even gonna be like early
and everything what's up with that
i got time to make some airfryer
pierogies
i'm not gonna because then i'll be late
but
i got the time for it
saved saved
i can't believe it oh there's two phases
now
i forgot about that part
yo now the damage is real though oh my
god
the high priestess card has appeared in
the basement heavy pog
two cents in that bad boy and uh there
we go hey
item unlocked



how about that
all right we'll be moving on to the next
run here um
trying to think dude you know what while
we're vibing
let's let's try to do something as the
lost
like let's try to unlock like finally
tainted lost or something like that okay
not that good
substantially worse
well hello to you as well hello
are we ever going to see the return of t
melt it was either
oh medicated dembo thank you for the
gifted subs thank you i'm still coming
down off the adrenaline of the last run
um
we did the bunch of tea melt on thursday
i think
i mean i think we did like on wednesday
and thursday we did like 16 ml runs
will it return in the future yes if
that's what you meant
if you were like you know i haven't seen
any since team melt well you're missing
out on
on a lot of great ones a lot of classics
but uh i i've got like i'm so far i mean
i know it's not a race
but like i'm so far behind in isaac
unlocks
that i'm like i gotta get some momentum
done on these man
t-melt is the like delete this challenge
or whatever it's called like the blank
eden fully randomized challenge
everything you pick up is like is is
zany it doesn't do what it says it does
because what it says
it does is blood of the marty
why do people call it t-melt t-melt is
um
an item that we picked up on one of our
first runs
it was very good and then i lost it and
and since that point onwards t-melt has
just become shorthand for the challenge
because i can never remember the name of
the challenge
why not let's do it tears up damage up
tears up damage oh the only thing we got
down was luck down
okay so we're unlocking tainted lost we
don't have an achievement yet
or we don't have a trinket yet all right
so we're just going to keep it moving
just
just keep me honest here drop trinket
when fined
drop trinket when fined
it's called the crazy time challenge
you know it was a crazy time uh twitch
rivals
pummel party i don't know if you were
there
easiest win in my life though by easiest
win
i mean i had like a more adrenaline
coursing through my veins than i've ever
experienced before in my entire life
okay quick reroll please
now that is that makes up for the luck
that we had earlier
i think the last time we had a library
we managed to re-roll it into item rooms
with the 50 chance for it to disappear
every time which is kind of amazing
this time this feels a little bit more
more statistically minded dude don't
even okay so like people
are like did you watch the new falcon in
the winter soldier
i'm still enjoying the show don't get me
wrong
i i just like i really don't care about
about the boat man like i know that it
makes me
the caricature of a marvel fan that's
like come on
just get back to the super powers come
on just get back to cool fight scenes
and stuff like that
but i'm like i just don't give two craps
about
about this boat i'm not like
mad that they're doing it i get then
there's character development that comes
out of it but i'm like
i'm like if there's one more montage
where like
you know they're fixing up this boat
with some feel-good music in the
background i'm gonna lose my damn mind
i don't remember you but you're you have
something to do with electricity so i'll
take you
yeah unless the maybe the boat ends up
being the new quinn jet or something
like that then we're
oh the lore implications i'm wondering
what what
what are the because with one division
there was all like the hints that got
dropped and stuff like that like
you know oh what does this mean for the
multiverse i wonder if uh
i wonder if those same channels are like
dying right now they're like who is the
magneto's boat falcon and the winter
soldier
maybe the the boat might be made of
wakandan
vibranium and then they could crash it
into dr doom maybe
like i don't know what you do if you're
if you're like comic explained right now
okay hold on um
well one of these items is just
genuinely useless so
i guess we will take nine lives which is
just genuinely good yeah
that's just good um and then we're gonna
reroll this son of a gun right here
that's pretty solid there's still no
trinket but that's okay
we're gonna find a trinket
that's dual is really good anyway
i um
i mean i'm still enjoying the show i
still look forward to it every week and
then like this one is that was the
second last episode right like the next
one's the finale
but i'm i i wouldn't say i'm like
looking forward to it ending
but i'm more like i'm kind of stoked for
the loki show and i
expected to not care about it uh
because i'm kind of you know loki
shenanigans from every single
marvel property of kind of a you know
i'm kind of over it
it's been like a decade but then i you
know it looks like they're going in a
cool direction at least with the
marketing so
we'll see we'll see would you say you're
low-key excited
plus you don't you don't see owen wilson
that much anymore man
there was a time in the mid 2000s you
couldn't escape him
wow jackie chan we're like back in the
old west
shanghai nights wow i'm dupree
i'm i'm starsky i'm starsky
i almost had it i felt it for a second
that i had it
and then ben stiller came to me and said
you want to be hutch and i said not more
i'm feeling more starsky is today i ca i
i'm i
it's almost there it's almost
a lot that was not close but it's pretty
like i'm like one
it's like a rubik's cube it looks like
it's the furthest away when it's the one
step away from victory there
now inhale it no i can't it's bad for
your vocal cords
jackie i thought we were gonna do a new
shanghai movie shanghai 430
wow
okay i realizing all the
all the tears in the world doesn't give
me the ability to take damage
willy-nilly
i don't get this bit the bit is that
owen wilson
um says wow kind of funny in an
idiosyncratic way in every single
movie he's ever been in play-doh cookie
tasty rainbow
it's not my bit it's the internet's bit
i'm just borrowing it from the internet
library
temporarily
what's your new favorite trash tv show
um
so i okay so i got a couple things to
say all right the first one
is that i'm about done with tlc
and it's not because the shows are too
trashy it's because they don't play the
trashy shows that i want
every single show on the network they
got rid of 90 day fiance not actually
but i don't know maybe they've got it on
like discovery plus or something like
that
instead every single show is about being
amish i just don't
freaking care man i'm over it okay i get
it they like
they don't use cell phones or whatever
but then as their kids get older they're
like can i have a cell phone and the
parents are like
you know obadiah asked us if he could
have a cell phone and we've gotta like
consult with the amish you know
and i'm like i just don't like okay fine
like i'll watch a couple seasons but
like i'm i'm kind of just over it now
like the
80 of the network right now is like
people with messed up
feet and then like amish people with
teenage kids
it's it's just not for me anymore
it's leaving me behind so i watched a
couple episodes of
nailed it which is a baking show where
they give
regular people impossible baking tasks
and then laugh at the results when they
when they come out
that show's pretty good i i we we tried
to watch a little bit a couple years ago
and i was like all the the tv trappings
around it um kind of annoyed me and i
washed out but the actual like uh
the the baking and the the reveal is
kind of funny
i would watch a compilation of just
reveals from that show
i think that would be hilarious um
but i wanted to pivot off of this and
talk about like um
this show that i found on twitter people
were talking about it on twitter it's
called i wanna marry harry
i i thought america had a monopoly
on ridiculous reality shows
did you did you see that or maybe you
lived through it it was a show where
they just had like
it was the bachelor but to marry prince
harry
but it wasn't actually prince harry it
was just a guy who
kind of looked like him
and then the the whole show was like
look i have to leave the trinket behind
i i wish i didn't because it's pretty
nice but
yeah you have to leave it behind um
i guess we could leave it behind later
but i'm gonna leave it behind now
just for my own sanity so i know that
i've already left it
um but i know we could later i'm just
it's
it's for my own it's it's copium okay
it's boomer copium so i can i can focus
on some banter
um help me
but um plus i don't even know what luck
does in this game anyway like i
i thought it helped you out in the
casino because that seems like logical
and then everyone was like oh three
thousand hours he doesn't know luck
doesn't help you out in the casino and i
was like what
it does in my defense it kind of feels
like that would be the most
intuitive example of it but that you
know i don't know that i don't know the
code
but um yeah so the show was called i
wanna marry harry and they had like a
prince harry look alike and then it was
just the bachelor
but i guess like you know some of the
women on the show were getting
wise to the fact that this guy is
clearly not prince harry and just kind
of looks like him
so they used to do like psyops where
they would have producers like walk by
their hotel room door and be like
guys buckingham palace is on the phone
and they're like really upset about this
show
they want to talk like right now and
like they had yeah
therapists that would were not actually
therapists they were just producers from
the show
and they would uh you know be like you
know you're having delusions like maybe
this tv show is giving you delusions and
that's why you don't think this is
clearly prince harry even though it's
clearly not
so i didn't investigate whether or not
the show was actually real
because that's a lot of work and it
confirmed my biases
so why would i risk having to you know
confront that
but it's uh certainly an interesting
social experiment
it reminded me i've talked about this a
few times before
but uh some people have never heard it
before and some people still disbelieve
it
there was a show that ran on the wb in
the early 2000s called superstar usa
and it was an amazing show but it was
very mean-spirited
the show was american idol but
instead of trying to find the best
singer they found the worst singer
but they that was not known to the
people that were involved
so they played it like it was just an
american idol clone
but actually all the good singers they
were they were like get out of here
you're garbage
and all the bad singers moved on and
then they'd like
you know i mean it doesn't get any
better as it goes along let me put it
that way
because like at the end they've got them
like you know
performing like in front of a live
studio audience that's like in on the
joke and cheering them on and stuff like
that um and then they like revealed it
at the very end and we're like you know
actually you suck
and they you know it's no big deal just
like 30 000
people in the staples center laughing at
them or something
sounds like it sounds like a fun time
nightmare nightmare
anyway i'm not gonna say like i didn't
watch it i watched the whole thing i was
also like 14. that's like the perfect
era
or perfect age for that kind of
entertainment haha these stupid idiots
think they can sing but they can't
so stupid get owned
how do you get through that and not
realize you're a bad singer
well like i mean it's almost like in
some ways i think it makes it worse
like because obviously like
i mean i hate to say it but if you were
like really intelligent you would
probably know you're not that good of a
singer right
so
i would say that it also
appealed to they got people on the show
that were not necessarily the smartest
people they could find either
let's put it this way they didn't have
to give up their appearance on jeopardy
in order to be on superstar usa
very fun show though if you ignore the
the
like severe psychological and ethical
problems
i mean we're taking that's pretty good
this is just hp right this is not red
stew this is just supper
yeah most is lack okay
all right we're out of here we're out of
here yeah exactly no more scamming
adults into thinking they're stars dude
let me try this oh we should have waited
for a potential re-roll but
hmm um
i think you just take this and i know
that you're gonna be like
what's the point well you know if we're
gonna lose
which i don't think we are yet but if
we're gonna lose i'd still like to win
so let's just take uh let's just take
that
i don't think void once every six rooms
sucking up an item that gives us
a 50 chance to reroll something is like
is that uh is that strong
get me out of here
yeah we were talking about the show
where uh people got gasoline into
thinking there was a chance that they
could marry prince harry
i don't know though like i feel like if
i figured it out i would just like
just keep vibing right
you know what i mean i think i think i
would i like couldn't you just like
blackmail the producers
and be like hey i know that's not prince
harry i'm gonna blow this whole thing up
for you if you don't give me like
i don't know like the nicest hotel room
i don't think knockout drops is is very
good by the way
but i do think it's fun and i like when
the tears go
cattuck like they did just there
i was on my country's got talent and i
knew i sucked
i mean like it's if i went on one of
those shows
and they were like you're great i would
be like
no i'm not joke's on you i'm hitting the
x button on you you're a bad judge
have you seen any darren brown specials
i have
i don't know how to feel about darren
brown okay
some of this stuff i think is pretty
cool
like when he does the the simultaneous
chess matches
um and i'm assuming some of it's kind of
faked but when he does the simultaneous
chess matches and he just remembers the
moves that like the opposite sides did
against each other
so it's really like five of them playing
uh themselves so he's guaranteed to
break even and then one other person
that he actually has to beat on his own
that's pretty cool like that's a smart
little trick
the one where have you seen the one
where he goes to the horse
track and like makes losing bets and
then convinces the people to
uh to pay him out anyway
and he goes up to like the betting
window and is like
i knew you were lucky that's why i came
to this
window he like smacks the he smacks the
the wall and then he's like i'm using
like neuro-linguistic programming to
trick
the the betting agent into thinking i
won when i actually lost and i'm like
i just don't believe it like
i'm not saying it's
like i can conceive of this happening
but the way that you're doing it i don't
know man it just seems like a little
this room sucks by the way like these
enemies are not so bad
but the uh
the the darkness on the room is is
bothering me for sure
please just get blown up by this mission
fail
hold on i gotta focus for a second like
there's some stuff i just
and i i mean it's like hypnosis right
like
i have seen live hypnosis
they did it in um i could use a trinket
this gives you spirit hearts for coins
right so it's worthless
i guess we'll take that um
yo hello hello
cobalt hello colt what it gives you
whispers every floor that's incredible
but like i i saw live hypnosis
um when i was in my freshman like
week of university they brought in a
hypnotist because that's just one of
they always do like a motivational
speech that's like you'll never have
another time like this in your life and
then they
you know bring in a hypnotist and like
you know you go watch a football game
and stuff like that
no thank you and i i still to this day i
kind of like don't believe in hypnotism
even though i watched it happen because
i'm just like i think those people
are just weak will
but i don't know like it it just doesn't
make sense to i'm like you want to be
hypnotized like that's the only way it
makes sense to me
is that the people that they they pick
are people who like they
they have like some kind of way of
knowing if somebody's a skeptic
like if they're 19 bald and wear thick
uh rimmed glasses you don't pick that
person
you pick the person that's you know
they're wearing like some
uh like a crystal around their neck or
something like that
and then you pretty soon you're gonna
have them dancing on the table right
so i because they always do that they
take like 10 people
and then they make like seven of them
sit down
i i definitely feel i mean i would never
like it was entertaining to watch the
hypnosis i wouldn't like try to blow it
up by being like yeah pick me just
kidding i'm a skeptic
you know please don't die
oh we have nine lives i shouldn't be
that worried anyway
but i i re i kind of just like hypnosis
is like a two-part it's it's a
two-person system right like both people
need to
be in on it
i think but that's why like you know
like the the darren brown stuff where
they have you know
like he makes simon pegg he go a bmx
bicycle what do you what do you want for
your birthday
i want a leather jacket and then after
like five minutes he's like i wanna
i want a bmx bike i'm like what the heck
is this
come on simon you're better than that
plus what are you gonna do with a bmx
bike dude you're like 45 years old
the leather jacket was a much more
sensible option
i need to find the full card here
and then like i i i like watching that
kind of stuff though because it kind of
like it gets your uh
it peaks your curiosity right like i
watched the
the uh the darren brown show where he
like convinced
people to do a heist
i don't know how i feel about that like
it's one of those things that's like
it's so
easy to stage that you think like
it can't be staged because it would be
so obvious but
i i don't know i just i guess i believe
that there's a lot of susceptible people
out there
where if if you were like rob a bank
they'd be like absolutely not and if you
were like please
they'd be like all right if you said
like
rob a bank they'd be like never and they
said do it or i'll be mad at you
they'd be like oh man i guess i don't
have a choice
he's an entertaining showman that's for
sure
yeah what if they said i won't be mad
i'll just be disappointed
yo tentacle monster thank you
thank you for the gifted subs thank you
that's true i mean like the the you know
the zimbardo prison experiment
and the what is it like the ash
experiment and the
there's so many um like
studies that are basically like you know
if you're in a a group
like you'll get some herd mentality like
the one where they show people
um like two lines that are obviously a
different size and then they ask you
like
which one is uh or they show you many
lines and then they go which one's the
same size as the control line
and like everybody in the group
deliberately goes that the one that's
like
the most obviously not is the one that's
closest and then the con
the actual like experiment uh
sample is like i guess something must be
wrong with my brain i didn't know
that's the ash experiment oh thank you
zimbardo admitted to faking his results
dude that's do you know
how he should be in prison
do you know um how many collective
thousands of hours
high school students have wasted
having to learn the zimbardo experiment
and he just
made up the results
that's crazy this like he's probably
wasted like
tens of millions of hours of
of human life
i'm not gonna say it's worse than murder
but how long is the average lifespan
i'm starting a new bit it's called
utilitarian court
uh the first case is the case of the
click baiting youtuber
oh sweet honey thank you for the gifted
subscriptions as well this bit is
dedicated to sweetani
the first bit is um the first case is
the case of the clickbait youtuber
um you stand accused of getting 10
million people to watch one minute of
your video with a title that said hot
lady inside
and then there was no hot lady inside
this wasted
seven human lifetimes worth of time you
have been sentenced
to 165 years in prison
goodbye death times seven
exactly don't even get me started on the
reality shows man
great gaming okay okay it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter polaroid negative i
guess we'll take the negative
full card out
we out here yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay um
i'm just gonna tell you straight up i do
not think
we will be able to beat
the beast however
i do think we'll be able to
unlock tainted lost we got a
we got a lot of advantages here
this room admittedly kind of sucks um
but we do have brimstone bombs if we
find ourselves in a
in a particularly nasty position
the man is a genius the man's a fool the
man is dead
escape from this room okay that's true
if we make it
through
to the beast we might be able to beat
the beast
just because of the way nine lives works
once you get there but
dude you don't even want to know in a
utilitarian courtroom do you know how
many years like i don't even they'd be
sentenced to millennia
in prison the the kinds of people who
make uh seo
did you see the threading of the needle
there
the kinds of people who make seo
optimized uh
recipe websites like they would we'd
throw away the key it happened again i
i can't remember it was like uh
i think it was on friday
i'll think about it i needed to know the
amount of time
for uh that you put pierogies
we don't need to go back that way if the
amount of time you need to put pierogies
into the air fryer
and like when you look up these recipes
it drives me crazy man hello and welcome
ninja airfryer instant pot airfryer have
you ever wanted to make pierogies in the
airfryer or in the instant pot or in the
airfryer
um you can make all sorts of things in
your airfryer low-fat airfryer pierogies
from frozen or from fresh it by the way
before you read this article
that you deliberately searched for about
how to cook pierogies in the airfryer
because of the way that the google
algorithm is set up to reward
uh like backlinks here's 17
other airfryer recipes that i thought
you might be interested in reading
before you want to read the recipe
that you actually search for in the
first place like i know you're here to
look up
airfryer pierogi recipes have you ever
considered air fryer sweet potato fries
look there they are
have you ever considered instant pot
chili con carne with turkey
like it's just crazy and then yeah it's
got a video that plays the entire time
you're on the website
it's i know we did the bit when we were
playing peria recently but like it's so
bad
you see it in youtube descriptions too
like at least in the youtube
description like there's like a video
that you can just click on and ignore
the description but
especially back in the day a lot of like
youtuber video descriptions were like
hello and welcome to the first
playthrough my first playthrough of
dishonored dishonored is a brand new
game published by
blank dishonored yeah by the then like
some of the descriptions literally would
have like uh
like tag at the bottom just tag stuffed
in the description
and it would just say hey don't worry
about it just ignore these
anyway um so hold on we have uh
we have pointy rib pointy rib
is not good enough
that's probably not good enough but i'm
i could be persuaded
i don't know there's things like um you
know there's click bait and then there's
marketing right
because someone in chat asked like what
if it's click bait but
click baiting for something good
i don't know i get sometimes i get
annoyed by that stuff as well like
every once in a while there will be like
a social cause where people are like yo
check out like my cool outfit and then
when you click on the link it's actually
like a link to donate
to some kind of charity and i'm like i'm
not offended by it but i
i also just want to be like you're not
helping
[Laughter]
maybe i'm too cynical i guess but i'm
like when people click on that and then
i
i mean what's the conversion rate on
people clicking on that and then being
like
okay i will donate you got me
i don't know i i get an i'm helping vibe
from that but
i'm not you know it's very minor in the
whole scheme of things i might just be a
curmudgeon
yeah but i think clickbait is just
marketing where you're
lying you know that's why i get annoyed
when people call
like you know
a non-misleading thumbnail to be click
bait
like the only time i all accept a click
bait
criticism for myself is when i'm wearing
a different shirt in the thumbnail
poggy than i'm wearing in the video
that's clickbait
yeah see small and knows what's up
i will say a small ant like i had a
video get sucked up by the algorithm
uh that was like a year old and i was
like what would small ant do
and i said he would say he would just
find a way to put
2021 in the title so i changed the title
to put 2021 in
and it just crushed the analytics
like i guess at some point the youtube
algorithm was like
you screwed it up you blew it
i'm not it's not your fault it's
probably my fault for the title but
still
uh you should wear the yellow burger
shirt more i thank you i do still own
the yellow burger shirt we just have a
problem
though which is that um
i've got the dad bod now from like nine
months of staying inside
and also in the winter time like when
you're wearing
heavy clothes it's really hard to
motivate yourself to like
exercise and eat well especially with a
baby admittedly but like
because you're like it's going to be
cold forever and then
it's like like it was 15 or 16 degrees
yesterday
sunny and beautiful and i was like frick
[Laughter]
it's nice now so right now i'm walking
i'm
rocking the the kevin smith which is i
want to show off my calves because
they're
admittedly quite impressive um but i
also don't want any clothing that
highlights
the dad bod so i'm rocking that like
oversized hoodie
mixed with um
like shorts not not huge jorts
but shorts yeah okay
classic dad fashion dude i was also
laughing
okay so like i mean i shouldn't say i
was laughing but you'll you'll
understand why in a second
so kate and i were out for a walk on
friday and we see all these like dad
cyclists um and they have like a
trying to little of how to describe it
they're biking and they got a seat
behind them that they can put like a
little kid on
or they have a trailer behind them that
they can have a little kid
sit in so that while they're biking the
kid gets to go outside and enjoy
like the the the ride as well right
kate was like i can't wait until the
baby's old enough for like you guys to
go out and do that and i'm like
i mean i'll do it i'm i'm a confident
cyclist
at least like for not falling over i'm a
confident cyclist
but i'd be a little nervous right
because you're not just like watching
out for yourself now you're watching out
for like
you know you're you're kin as well and
then
we you know we talked about him we're
like ah it's a while away this weekend
i was just hanging out outside for a
minute
enjoying the weather and then i saw
a dad with one of the trailers i'm
trying to think about how i'm going to
do this for the camera but anyway
dad with one of those bike trailers came
through an intersection
turned left and started pedaling and
just
jacked knife the trailer with his kid in
it and it went skidding like
like three feet on the on the road and
i was like oh my god what are the odds
and then everyone on the sidewalk was
like oh god is everything okay and
it you know it's they seemed like they
were okay the kid had a helmet on and
everything but
it was uh it was unexpected for sure
also one of those things where you like
if you saw it on like a dash cam video
you'd be like
i'll never see that in real life it was
uh it was remarkable for sure
yeah the kid was probably having a great
time that's the funny part the dad would
like
i mean i could put myself in that dad's
shoes like
it's gonna be playing in his mind before
he goes to sleep for like the next 50
years
oh you would never be able to tell um
your wife for sure
like if she came back and she had like a
scrape on her forehead or something you
just have to be like i don't know i
guess she like scratched herself or
whatever did you forget to cut her nails
as a kid though like you and you know
you don't realize this until you get
older for sure
but like you can really weather injuries
a lot better
like my foot still hurts
[Laughter]
i stubbed my toe it's almost like five
weeks ago now and there's still like
like an internal bruise or something it
still hurts pretty bad
sometimes um i don't know like it hurts
like a three out of ten sometimes i
guess but
like a kid they don't care man they
bounce back so fast i see kids like
skateboarding and they like you know hit
their forehead on the sidewalk
and then they get up and they're like
trying to figure out if they're upset
and then they're like um this is the
greatest
day of my life it's crazy
you know what what do you excuse me
use your free health care dingus all
right i'll tell you what i'll go to the
doctor if you
scumbags give us some of your vaccines
i had to do the math the other day where
i was like they announced that like
by june canada is going to have the
vaccine supply to give 80
of the adult population uh their vaccine
or at least their first dose
come on man come on and i had to do the
math
and like try to figure out if i was
going to be in that first 80
i don't know i must be in the oldest 80
percent
of the population i'm certain i can't be
in the youngest 20
anymore but i also have like no
comorbidities
so i don't know i don't know if i'm
gonna if i'm gonna be in there man
plus like why not i'm not mad like this
is just
probably how public health should be
done to begin with but like
ontario's going through some real stuff
right now i wouldn't be surprised if
like
the federal government gives more of the
vaccines to ontario than uh
than british columbia even though bc's
and it's a little
like scary in bc but things are getting
better over time and ontario seems to be
trending in the opposite direction but
okay take me up
alberta's bad too
dang east coast man just
joined their lobsters over there
freaking jerks
hello from new brunswick hello
give us some of your vaccines man
i don't know you probably don't have any
either
i heard quebec is getting it pretty bad
too i mean it's just it's bad everywhere
here
like it's yeah i mean we've been over
this how many times you have to go over
it as soon as the vaccines came out
even if they weren't available where you
lived people were like it's over
okay let's do it
finally dude we unlocked tinted lost
through all of our discussions that we
had here all the banter
we at least have unlocked into lost now
i will say
tinted lost is also the character for
whom like uh
i have heard the most negativity
[Laughter]
i've seen a lot of stream titles that
are like uh
today's the day we finally win with
tinted lost but
okay we're good let's let's give it a
try here
it's just old lost okay
that's still pretty tough though because
like some of the stuff on the post-it
note is
way harder than than anything in rebirth
this is gonna be tough i'm not gonna lie
all right i think our principal goal
should just be
to make it what happens now do we get to
start
okay i want we probably get to start on
phase two
come on man come on
we probably get to start on phase two if
we get to phase two
if not then then this is mighty spicy
don't forget your brimstone bombs
that's that's pretty bad that's pretty
bad
that's pretty bad okay we need put some
brimstone bombs in there
remember all you got to do is handle
that tv man
if you can get through the tv you got
nothing to worry about
can of corn okay one of you scumbags
it has to pay the piper who's getting
permabanned
somebody in chad said if you stand still
on the brimstones you'll be fine
i have been lied to i was like is it
really that easy
who's accepting the permaban
it's got to be done
what's that thing that they do in
mid-summer it's called like the hammer
spot or whatever
phase two baby phase two
okay again we got bombs we're just
chilling
the bodhisattva exactly
gonna sell my hammertown
bodhisattva okay i i feel somewhat
comfortable
dropping some of this stuff in here now
hey man don't do that
don't don't do a spinny move he's doing
the spinnies man
admin he's doing it sideways
you knew it was coming too that's the
worst part okay save bombs
for phase two
i think that's what i'm learning here
save bombs for phase two
i gotta remember cobalt was here cobalt
said
you got this his exact words
you got this
heavy pog okay we got we got one use
of of holy mantle still remaining
immediately
oh my gosh i should be dead
hey man at least we had holy mantle
you don't win the game by preserving
holy mantle you win the game by getting
the enemies hp to zero
great bomb okay cool
going offline guys i mean i'm not
disappointed just
just to get tainted lost was really what
i was looking for in the first place but
this is oh oh my god this is an
opportunity for us to
complete this post-it note at least
you're not i mean it's gonna be tough to
complete this post-it note not as tough
as on some other characters obviously
but
you hate to squander an opportunity
i guess our damage is not very good
admittedly
i can't beat myself up too too much
but our fire rate is incredible forgot
what this does lodestone please
frick okay saved saved
he's a genius don't do that resin dude
one of these days i'm gonna i'm gonna
write out the flow chart for how to deal
with that attack instead of just relying
on feel
saved saved to an unbelievable degree
don't spin no
spinning okay
he's spinning again
okay that's fine we get to be dark judas
now we get to be dark judas now
that was that was a good attempt
now this is just for like bragging
rights i think we've already done the
judas stuff but
mom can you pick me up they're doing it
sideways again
okay that was like mighty close i could
not
stop spinning
did you see a multi-dimensional baby
plus uh
brimstone bombs in there like that that
looked pretty cool i don't know if it
actually did anything but
okay saved not saved
are you still coming up here what's
what's going on he's saved saved
i'm gonna learn all these words this is
gonna be my new karaoke song
it missed
if the brimstone bomb had just hit we'd
be making it
we'd be making a can of corn baby can of
corn great great any though slash marker
tainted lost unlocked can
you believe it let's let's try to do a
run as tainted loss that should be fine



all right
i thought i had it man i thought i had
it okay
um tainted lost here we go new run
other side of the posted note the lost
better items no mantle what does better
items mean
like did they did they actually tailor
item pools because if so that's pretty
cool
because we don't have holy mantle
we could use the holy card
to get into curse rooms but that seems
like a pretty huge
you know waste of uh a very valuable
resource
oh they ranked all items on a tier from
one to four and then as the lost you can
only get threes and fours oh that's
pretty good
that's wrong all right you know that's
fine that's that's what's gonna stick in
my brain as being right for a long time
so
you know
i will as usual just try to compensate
for my lack of specific knowledge by
instead um
dodging it didn't work on that last
attempt but you never know
so this is considered a good item then
okay
yeah i know holy card lasts forever so
in theory like there's no reason not to
pop it
but for some reason i just i i don't
know like for now i just feel
safer knowing that it's there
i know that doesn't make any sense it's
like extremely counterintuitive
but just knowing that it's there kind of
makes me feel nice
that's true we could get blank card at
some point
look you can't live your life
exclusively via logic right
otherwise you'll be doing like tai bo
instead of watching the stream right now
so just all i ask is that you give me
the same allowance that you give
yourself
okay i'm not gonna step on you
you get a new holy card on every floor
chad is this a little bit of trolling or
is this correct
that's that's trolling okay
i do i need to direct you to the rules
again low effort trolling is considered
insubordinate and churlish
will not be tolerated
tear size baby now we're talking
you know how could i not
we gotta give it a shot i mean the idea
that you could uh
now i'm realizing like trying like
anybody that's done this is the greatest
among the greatest isaac players in
history
so cobalt stand up cobalt take a bow
cobalt cobalt wasn't there
take me to the fair change my underwear
if you press alt f4 you get a new
holy card that's true dude you know what
i think would be sick i think
that um they should add something to
punish
the people who hold r
like i think if you hold r to restart a
run
they should make it so your first item
room on the next run has a higher
percentage chance
stacking of course to be even worse
i think that could be a good idea
repeating of course
or yeah every every new run you gotta
buy
tokens okay this is where you pop it
what did i tell you
[Laughter]
hate these freaking flies man
clip farming it's a that's a clip farm
that won't make sense outside of the
context of someone who's
very aware of how things go in isaac but
still you only get good items on this
run which is one of the
is one of the uh great things about the
new lost is that you only get good items
so
probably restart this one
okay alt path might be something we wait
on wait wait for that first deal with
the devil and see how the mood strikes
you
that's not so bad
okay hold on and wait does holy card
really only last
for a floor
no it lasts forever until you get hit
okay
what's up with the i mean that's just
mean-spirited trolling
trolling to get the streamer to like
take damage is one thing
trolling to like make the streamer not
use the item properly that's just like
you're
you're a sicko man you got problems
i just gotta you're gonna think that
i've lost my mind okay
i'm going to use
the holy card to get the item from the
curse room
because i think it's nine lives okay
don't worry because
when when i kill them they're gonna drop
a a
teleport card and we're not gonna have
to teleport card
baby okay you know what well
now we don't have to worry about this
you can't get nine lives on this
character i knew that
it's not a tier three item according to
the the guidebook
according to poor richard's almanac it's
merely a it's a tier seven item
you know what ben franklin said man
thank you uh slipped rib
what did ben franklin say i don't know
there's a good quote it was something
like
loaning someone money is the best way to
turn an enemy into a friend or a friend
into an enemy that's a good one
i'll settle for mom's knife maybe
pageant boy another top tier item
it's another top tier item courtesy of
the the better item pool
why this is an honest question i need
some american history buffs here
why didn't ben franklin run for
president
was he too old i mean like not too old
to
win but like too old to want to
too cool
too busy getting a little slice of the
bubbly i know what you're talking about
is there is there a real answer he
didn't want to that's how you know he
was smart man
i've said it many times
like why would you ever if you were
already successful
in the private sector like ben franklin
was
why would you ever want to uh
be the president seems like a thankless
job
it's another good item one of the more
we can't take that you literally can't
take that
if you take it you just die
we'll walk into a room and it will it
will just blow up on an adjacent enemy
and kill us
get the chest good one we do a little
trolling
he was going to but then alexander
hamilton said i loved you ben and we ran
they ran away together they were just 60
and it felt so right
sleeping all day staying up all night
if i'm ben franklin now things could get
better
we'll give the town this bell that's
cracked forever
put me on the bill and i will pay you
for movies
he wait wait wait what bill has been
friend he's on the 100 right nobody's
buying a movie with a hundred what am i
talking about
dude i saw on twitter that the staples
center
um is not accepting cash for concession
sales right now because of you know
covet related concerns uh okay now we're
talking
only good items and you know whether or
not you agree
or disagree with this decision
you should read the comments
on twitter that are replying to that
tweet from the staples center they're
so good some of the comments people that
again i'm not gonna say they all have
uh their dog is their profile photo
some of them have their truck uh and
some of them have ben franklin weirdly
enough
i don't understand it however um
one of them was like i hope every level
of government in america
comes down on your ass for this decision
this is crazy i was oh mike
peep i didn't realize man
people feel very strongly about i think
it's less about using cash and more
about not using
like an electronic payment that can be
easily tracked
or something by the way tweeted from my
iphone with location services turned on
but
hold on we could there's always a chance
we become guppy
so the question is really
whether or not like abaddon is just
damage
guppy is a higher percentage chance to
get you the win
but you're also probably going to suffer
for a bit in advance but that's that's
what i'm going for man that's what i'm
going i'm going for the guppy
the guppy dream much higher risk much
higher reward
i know there's no nine lives i was not
aware of the fact that there's no collar
although that makes sense
but there's still i mean hairball head
eye
and tail
that that classic nursery rhyme is still
possible
also yeah abaddon's not that good anyway
i'm not sweating this as much as you
might think
dude now we're talking imagine if we got
uh
spoonbender
we're betting on guppy man all i'm
saying
you're gonna be ashamed of your words
and your deeds if slash when we become
guppy
and you're gonna be like i knew you
could do it
i was just memeing and then i'm gonna
look through your chat history and
there's gonna be a lot of stuff in there
that doesn't look like a meme
i'm gonna put you on blast you're all
gonna be sorry
be careful who you made fun of in middle
school
i'll take a key please thank you thank
you
i mean we're still like extremely likely
to lose here
just getting anything on the post-it
note would be a huge win like even if we
just beat mom
all right well the bad news is we died
the good news is abaddon wouldn't have
stopped that
that hurts
freaking mimics man i like that there's
a real challenge in the game though
okay the last i mean this is the way
like all the
isaac dlc has gone right
like the uh they release something it's
really hard
and then people go it's too hard
and then they're like okay fine we've
made it
insanely easy we made the lost the
easiest character in the game
we made it so you'd you know like your
kid brother who's
17 months old can win as the keeper
and then but we added one more new thing
that's a little tough
so like i'm happy that this exists
before they get cyberbullied into
removing it
don't hit me
for sure this run man for sure this run
can of corn baby
the harder the better i think that the
difficulty in the game is honestly like
i mean there's some stuff that's
like real freaking hard don't get me
wrong
but i think that uh
like it's a much more engaging
difficulty than after birth plus which
was like
for real just
i mean it was like i didn't get any good
items i lose i got a good item i win
again
i think it's better now
dude now we're talking
lost holy mantle was an unlock you had
to work for you know i don't
do i i remembered like nothing about the
unlock process
you got me on that one you should drop
this for now
i don't know man you know what let's
take this let's drop it on the boss
fight who knows we can unlock
super tainted lost
suck me baby tane it lost i don't know
what lyric he says but
in my head it's always suck me baby
tainted love i don't think that's how it
goes though

way the other item is black hole tears
no i think i'm a mark man what can i say
and then we got a good deal with the
devil so i'm gonna try it man i'm gonna
i mean we
why not man why not why not
i mean we gotta do it at some point
booger
tears plus mark i mean that's like a 10
out of 10 start
if we're not able to get defense at
least
donkey donkey
yeah you got to pick up items that have
your name in them that's why i like um
mysterious egg so much
since you're the lost can you just go
through the mirror you know what that's
that's an interesting question
i have to imagine you probably can
dude this runs got something going right
here
i don't i don't want to go through the
mirror yet until i know um
what the floor looks like but but we can
do that
i mean i'll just be honest with you i
don't think there's any advantage to
going into the
mirror until we at least fight the boss
and get uh whatever the item is there
dude that's what come on be smart yes
you can get the money no you shouldn't
knowledge is knowing you can get the
money wisdom is knowing it's
it's not worth the risk genius
is doing it anyway
after all why shouldn't i have it
i hate you
hey buddy just be dead
i'm mad i'm upset
i'm perturbed
this is really good though okay hold on
hold on
absolutely absolutely
i mean it's a great trinket for sure
now i'm like is there anything we can do
the answer is no right like there's
there's no defensive items there's no
respawns
man i never thought i would have rather
had
uh monstrous tooth monstro's tooth
stands a chance to kill you
so a holy guard
saved actually unbelievably saved
i don't know what to say
go to shop every floor oh i will
captain america voice yes i think i will
well you know what we lived that's
obviously i would have rather not gotten
hit there but we did at least survive
i'm gonna leave it all out on the table
here i'm gonna go fight the boss
all cards have a 10 chance to be holy
cards
oh baby
this is the scariest room
easy come easy go exactly man some
some things in life the harder you try
to grab them the more they slip through
your fingers
some things in life the harder you try
to grab them the more they've got you
wrapped around their finger dear
i'm such a fool card for you
okay i mean this boss could easily hit
me though but we got brimstone bomb so
just drop one of these
get the heck out of town don't get hit
don't explode
you're dead you stink you suck
and dude huge item huge item it was
really huge how it lowered
my speed and rate of fire by a huge
amount
really appreciate it thank you
good nice damage nice damage i'm not
denying that part but
you're flat no the shop is in the mirror
world the shop is empty
and in in the mirror world people wear
hands on their
they wear shoes on their hands and
hamburgers eat people
i mean we got to right like
how could i not thoughts on the movie no
country for old men i mean what is there
to say
it's a masterpiece it's a noted
masterpiece
it's a great movie
it's so tiny it's hard to tell
that's all i got though like i don't
know i got no other banter
i'm banterless
have you heard of brooks and dunn sorry
i thought i was banterless i didn't
realize i was just getting started
i have indeed heard of uh hill uh
hillbilly deluxe
singing band uh brooks and dunn
hillbilly deluxe big
pickup trunks big time and in a small
town
they also i mean they were like probably
the most caught the popular
country rock group of my childhood
there were more popular individual
artists such as
garth brooks who you may know as chris
gaines
um
faith hill as well but i mean they were
really popular
that maria song played everywhere you
couldn't escape it
okay holy holy card
holy card it's a card it's not holy
let's turn them all into pills that'd be
funny

get four and a half volt it does like we
don't have a space bar item right
have you seen the crocodile hunter movie
i legit thought my tv was glitching oh
man yeah
so like steve irwin was like
a really big cultural force
right that crocodile hunter movie is a
is a legitimate thing
like you know there was like a british
invasion where like you know
the rest i knew it was coming too the
rest of the world fell in love with the
beatles
there was like an australian invasion
too
some like it was slower and more
insidious between the 80s and the 90s in
the in the early 2000s
crocodile dundee of course um
you know what let's just see if we can
get something cool here i'm a fool why
would i do this
um i thought maybe we would teleport us
to a deal with the devil then we could
holy card out if it was worth it
crocodile dundee crocodile hunter
kangaroo jack um
survivor season two took place in
australia hugh jackman was the
biggest actor in the world for a while
like
yeah men at work exactly
dude that that would be really good mad
max yeah
mel gibson
i can't get to sleep
like that's uh that the only thing i
remember
apart from meeting my roommate and him
uh
having a harry potter in the
philosopher's stone poster
and then also telling me you're going
bald when i was 17 years old and it was
like the first words he ever said to me
um
the only thing i remember about my first
day of being in the dorm rooms
is that we had like 10 15 people just
hanging out
and uh somebody was using their laptop
and they're like oh
steve irwin died and we were all like oh
it's like it was one of those way you
know you remember where you were sort of
moments
sometimes you just gotta be sad exactly
health up baby let's go
well he does it four times man
oh my god what a shot
[Laughter]
i didn't think he could do it you got to
hand it to him that was that was a great
shot
just going to sneak right by you there
that was bad trip i would have uh
i don't know what i would have done i've
got to come up with something more
creative i've already said
i'm going to throw my computer in the
dishwasher i got to think about what
would happen next
yeah tainted lost does not have holy
mantle on the bright side they only get
good items such as isaac's jar of tears
and also
uh monstrous tooth so
you know you take the good with the bad
yeah there you go i'm gonna put my gpu
in there in the air fryer
we lose this one i'm gonna put my gpu in
the air fryer dude
holy card by the way
dunk dunk dunky donkey donkey
dunk dunk
this character can get spike chests oh
no way
oh i'll be sure to stay on the lookout
for that that'd be embarrassing
okay half a half damage for a room
that's pretty solid
glowing hourglass the glowing hourglass
could be pretty sick
if we could get that was it in the shop
i wasn't paying attention at all
i was i was riffing
he's riffing jerry he's going
look at that okay okay okay okay
great stuff unbelievably good
you'll still die in one hit no but if we
lose holy mantle glowing hourglass would
take us out of the room dude
i was in the item pool
seinfeld i saw an episode of seinfeld
this weekend i don't think i've seen
before
it was like new to me it was um
the episode where george pretends
he's a tourist a woman that he's dating
and jerry shaves his chest but it starts
to itch
on a long bus trip and he kind of
becomes a werewolf
it's a good episode i like when when
george cleans out his apartment
we gotta try him in when george cleans
out his apartment and then
he tells the woman like hey i'm looking
at this to maybe buy it
and then she's like yeah let's get out
of here
we got to air this place out it stinks
oh
it's good stuff come on man just oh
that is you know what i totally forgot
that is top of the muffin to you as well
yeah and none of the dumps will take the
bottom
i mean we gotta try man like this this
makes sense
this makes a lot of sense to me and now
i'm also like
why wouldn't we
because we're invincible dude
oh but you don't have holy mantle wait
but we do
we haven't been hit yet right so we have
holy cards still active

sorry sorry seo baby
you're not supposed to get hit by that
enemy
is the plan to 100 percent the game
yeah yeah that's the that's the plan
it's what we've done you know for like
i mean now you're just getting me sad
because like like
you know that's what we've done for like
11 years that we've been playing this
so like we're gonna we're gonna i have
the utmost faith that we're gonna get
there
and if any like being first to do it is
really cool
i don't have that kind of like workflow
right now
if i can't be first to do it i would
rather stretch it out over as long a
period as possible
um so as to savor
the delicious bites
of isaac content the morsels
of pog if you will
okay like it's the most annoying duke of
flies that's ever existed
i can't believe you really could without
having any bombs i was like how could
how could that even be done man that was
i guess you just have more patience all
right sister maggie
we're doing pretty well here sister
maggie no complaints
can we get some sea shanties oh
or is it like way the weather man come
to bring me oranges and tea and rum
way hair the weatherman come to take me
off forward
something like that how does it go i
don't
i don't know i got a new phone and i
haven't installed tick tock yet
there once was a ship that was put to
seasons
i don't know you think i'm more of a
base or more of a baritone
i think it's not the weather man it's
weller man oh
i see what the heck is a weller man
i gotta just let me go man just let me
come on bumbo
again
it's crazy to think that like you know
it sounds like an old-timey job right
like weller man
but then like just a show of hands in
chat
you can give me a y or an n okay like
daniel giesling's style
um did your job
exist 100 years ago why or n
obviously mine is it did not exist but
like if you're a computer programmer
your job didn't exist 100 years ago
you know data scientist i don't know
i feel like like probably close to
maybe half of the population works in a
in a field that didn't exist a century
ago it's pretty crazy
now how many of you work in a job that
won't exist a century from now
i'm gonna i'll hit you with a y on that
one
i'm probably gonna end up being a y
there
uh it's my guess anyway okay okay just
be smart here be smart
dude i was watching how it's made this
weekend i was so excited right so the
first
the first thing they showed on how it's
made was how to make uh
teepees you know like uh native american
houses
it was really cool i learned so much
about how these are made and like
it really piques your curiosity right
you're like how are they making this
stuff you know
so long ago like i i would be so stupid
in prehistory you know like i would
i would have nothing like the only
reason i
appear smart is because i'm well read
if books didn't exist i would just be i
would be like the village idiot i'd just
be sitting there going like you know
i don't know man like i'm just waiting
for archimedes to come along or
something
um low practical intelligence is a very
polite way to describe that thank you
that's that's a nice way to put it
um bumbo
don't stop till you're numb don't stop
till your bumbo
keep it up brother um
look at that but uh that was incredible
and they were like when we come back how
to make croissants
and i was like this is gonna be awesome
and then it was disgusting
because it wasn't um like i thought it
was gonna be like a french baker making
croissants or something like that
but it was literally at a factory where
there was zero
human involvement and it was just
disgusting
like i'll eat stuff that's made in a
factory but i never want to see it ever
again
like they were like and then a 20
kilogram block of margarine is dispensed
onto the conveyor belt and i was like
this is
just gross like just turn it off
there was no human being at any moment
whatsoever during throughout this show
there was a tinted rock where where is
this tinted rock there it is thank you
so what i don't it's like i don't know
just kind of disgusting
i'm not like oh a robot touch this i'm
more like
i don't know i'm like that i guess
that's how like i want like my
auto glass to be made but it
was like no wonder grocery store
croissants taste so bad
the only person there is like a quality
control officer at the very end of the
line to make sure that they
uh you know they don't accidentally put
out like a rectangular croissant or
something like that people would lose
their mind
okay it's this not so bad it's not so
bad
um lusty blood's not that good anymore
so we're going to take the mark but it's
it's close it's a close call
let's go to a secret room yeah i also i
have no idea why they were using
margarine
i i have to imagine it was something
like um
you know butter is too expensive or
margarine is easier to work with at room
temperature or something
i mean marjorie it tastes good too
you're not wrong it tastes good
it do be tasting good
butter tastes better but margarine still
do be tasting good
okay i gotta focus a little bit here
butter is pretty unhealthy oh if we come
around on the cycle again
when i was a little kid margarine was
very popular because
it was uh considered healthier than
butter uh and then
when knowledge of like trans fats and
partially hydrogenated oils
came out and people were like these are
terrible for you everyone was like okay
we're getting back on the butter train
now i see people in chat being like
margarine is better for you than butter
and i'm like all right here we
cj all you had to do was follow the dang
train
we're going back again that's why you'll
be back again can't find a weather man
can fight you know you know pearl jam
also known as creed
but also known as a sea shanty
both bad hey what are you talking about
is good
it's not the best thing for you to eat
obviously but it's tasty man
i even think for you it's like it's not
that bad
but i don't know i'm not a nutritionist
i'm basing my nutrition strategy with
respect to butter is based almost
entirely on hope i suppose so
okay the lock up trinket i don't know
i'm a big fan
of uh bumbo being able to get to max
level bumbo and then maybe we'll swap
out here
what's your beef with i'm thinking of
ending things
um i'm like okay so like we've talked
about the movie before right
my beef with i'm thinking of ending
things is that
i really look at charlie kaufman almost
like kind of like a pretentious
george lucas he's like an overeducated
george lucas
he needs someone in
the film making chain
to say no to him he needs somebody to be
like charlie
nobody is gonna know what the hell is
going on
in the movie like no they're gonna have
to watch
15 video essays just to understand what
the hell's happening here
like could you just put in like one line
or something where they go like hey and
here's what's happening
i got nothing against uh i mean i like
charlie kaufman
i just i you know i i guess i prefer the
movies where he didn't direct
if that makes sense i like him as a
screenwriter
as a viewer i find his movies are too um
impenetrable for me to
i mean i find them interesting i don't
know if i would say enjoyable but
let's go check you never know a black
market
can of corn i couldn't get past the
intro of that film
you don't even know man like
it goes places after that
okay hold on i gotta assume there might
be a holy card available here somewhere
where the heck is the shop just let me
go to the shop man
will any canadian media ever top
kenny versus spenny it's a good is i say
is even a great question kenny versus
spanny great show
just checking you know what for three
cents i'll do it i'll do it
i think mouth and i would be a little
bit like kenny versus spenny
but i think like we're we're both kenny
and we're both
spanny so i don't know like how it will
work
like i'm definitely spanish in some ways
but malf is spanish in other ways i
think
i think we both got a little troll
energy
that's all i got i'm such a samantha
you only get good items as this version
of the lost which is one of the reasons
that this is not as hard
as you would expect it to be
bozo did the dub
what kind of a note taker were you in
university
um i would i'm going to say average like
i got
i got no flex one way or the other there
i'm a firm believer it depends on the
class
but on average i would like this please
thank you
i'm a believer that the predominant
reason you take notes is not
to reference them later because you can
find all that information
online faster for the most part but
when you are act when you're taking
notes you're actively listening
and you're more likely to remember
what's being said and to ask yourself
questions
as you're hearing it and thus like
understand it a little bit better
that's that's my take on that
so i think i was almost like a little
snobby
when i went to university and i was like
oh my memory is good i don't need to
take notes look at all these people
going tiki taki tiki taki you know and
then uh
jeez i mean i got to tell you i think
got all of those we still got to take
guppy's head but
then i realized later that i was like
you know i was hurting myself for no
reason
if you just take the notes it makes you
more of an active listener i think
i don't i'm saving my money we're going
to get a blank card or a holy card or
both
at some point and it's going to be it's
going to be very positive
like i even i took really good notes in
programming
school which is like largely unnecessary
and secondarily
extremely annoying because if you're
typing into a word processor and your
teacher is writing
like a code sample on the board the
formatting looks freaking horrible
in in microsoft word but um
but just typing the stuff out like while
my professor
said it i think was was good for keeping
it in the in the old noggin
okay that excuse me i'd like some of the
coins please i i fought for them
i'd like some of the coins please
just take notes and notepad plus plus
are you kidding me man i dodged it for
so long
well like i mean i don't know what you
want me to tell you like the point of
school is not to take notes in the most
efficient
note-taking executable
like um you know whatever it's like the
programmer version of when like someone
shows up to class on day one
and they've got like 900 different
colors of gel pen
and they're like i'm gonna have the best
notes of all time
and then like on day four they're not
even in class anymore
i you know i'm not gonna bust out the
transcripts but i'm gonna tell you i had
no problem with the
i had no problem with my performance in
programming school and
even if i did it was not microsoft
word's fault i'll tell you that much
it's jdbc okay i would very much like a
deal with the devil here
i would very much like a shop with a
holy card to compensate for the damage
we took on the last floor that we did
not deserve to take on the last floor
or on the in the mob trap room
will we ever see you on no pixel i'm
still
i'm still holding out hope man sips gave
me his contact
i added i sent a discord request to
their inbox
uh in february any day now
any day now man
they're gonna they're gonna accept and
get me in there
[Laughter]
it's a tough one i don't know jar of
flies might be better
at least give it a try that's still
going on dude it's still pretty popular
but right now like i don't know with it
there was a time pre-repentance where i
think it would have been a good fit
but now i'm like ah you know i've got so
much uh
repentance to play i got so much uh
you know it and then just like this week
i want to start cycling in some extra
indie games and stuff like that um i
really don't think i have space for
something like
like no pixel right now which now that
i've said that means uh
we're gonna definitely get the friend
request accepted probably like within
the next 15 minutes
just the way the way of the road
a song could get you in you could play
off stream when you have time
who's gonna tell them it's a like don't
it's not a rude thing to say but like
times times at a bit of a premium right
now
[Laughter]
but i don't know if if kate would be too
receptive to the idea of like
hey honey like uh can't uh is it okay if
we don't hang out tonight in like the 45
minutes that we get to uh
actually be husband and wife i was
thinking that it would be really cool to
like you know
be a taxi driver on someone else's
stream i
i don't know if that would go over too
well
excuse me matushka chest
damn 45 minutes you're a champ you're
telling me man like i tried to watch the
whole 52 minutes of the episode
um of the falcon and the winter soldier
but then like the last seven minutes man
is
it's credits how do they have seven
minutes of credits every episode
then i gotta go i do the fast forward to
see if there's a post-credits scene
and then there is a post-credits scene
but i accidentally
end up in the middle of the post-credits
scene and i'm like oh man
now i know what happens and then i gotta
pull it back a little
bit that's still worth it there
but i already know what happens now so
like what's the point man
what's the point
how do i get better at isaac
uh i mean like
i mean it's just like his practice
really like you know just play
like a long time
that's basically all i got i mean i put
essentially no active work into getting
better at this game like
i never read a guide that was like how
to be good at isaac
and even then i ended up getting okay at
the game eventually
by just dedicating most of my 20s to it
so like if you're willing to do that
then then that'll that'll set you up i
don't know if it's
possible to uh just read a guide that's
like you know
here's we're gonna make you better you
gotta learn like the you gotta
encode the muscle memory for all these
enemies like deep in your mind
chad and youtube comments they have
helped out in the past but
and i i don't mean this in an
antagonistic way there's been examples
on stream where like chad has saved the
run without a doubt
but like honestly reading chat
okay during
the the runs has actually been like a
detriment for sure
it's one of those things where it's like
you know it's almost like co-op
it's not even trolling it's just like i
mean they focus on things that i
consider less important
so it's it's like the idea of like
you're you know you're on a ship but you
got like
or you're let's say you're on a plane
but you got you know
10 000 pilots i think the odds of that
plane crashing
are much higher than just one guy
piloting it
we got a lot of backseat flyers on lion
air
but we're we're working on it here okay
are we gonna do boss rush
we we probably should not i guess it
doesn't matter what we take here
let's just see let's just see what they
got man let's just let's just take a
look what they got
all of those items are pretty bad
um i know we got to do it at some point
i don't think this is the run
i think instead we'll we'll be happy to
get maybe like a mom's heart in this one
and if we can take it a little further
then then even better
crack the sky is asked here i welcome
you know you did you put the seat in
yourself and then send me a screenshot
of you beating boss rush and i will
click the heart button on twitter
i'll trade you some of my dopamine
i want to see though in the screenshot i
want to see t9l6vj1p
okay
if it's tweeted to me in business hours
i will click the heart on it if i see it
i promise you that
you have to be inside boss rush holding

with the pedestal that you get for
beating boss rush
available in the southern quadrant of
the screen
what do i win i will click the heart
button on your tweet
it's not a great prize i'm gonna be
honest
but like you know
so what don't do it then i guess
i would never encourage you to to waste
your time like that
when you could instead be retweeting
stuff like you know
who tag your favorite streamer and uh if
we pick you
uh in the sweepstakes you win like a 30
90 ti
i thought you were off on weekends on
twitter i check in now and then i try
not to tweet much but i
sometimes i scroll through a little
bro it's holy card now we're talking
you hearted my youtube comment and made
my day really
i've been i've been uh i've been
clicking the hard button a lot
i'm not shy about clicking the heart i
also am and
don't take this as like you know an
insult to you now that you said i
clicked the heart button
you also do not have to leave like an
insanely
um original comment if your comment is
near the top
and is also positive i'll click the
heart button on anything man
like it i i will say i've stopped
hitting the the hard button on
so many that just say blank's been real
quiet since blank dropped because i
think we are at the point where maybe
like it's getting a little too much
so i'm trying to be the change i want to
see in the world there but uh
certainly like if you type hey honey
wake up new pog just dropped like i'll
click the hard button on that man
now i know what's happening in the
comments for this vod too
but i do i laugh every time when like
sometimes it'll be like
like the comment section will be like
really you know
me circle jerky and very positive
and then someone in the comments will be
like i miss when we could have like a
real discussion
in the youtube comments and i'm like no
you don't dummy
come on you just miss when you used to
be able to put the green text arrows
that were like here's everything nl did
wrong in the episode
and then the culture of the youtube
channel at the time was that that would
get upvoted to the very top and you'd
get your dopamine
now i've taken away that avenue for
dopamine
and the only way you can get dopamine is
by being like breathlessly positive in
all situations and you don't you know
you feel like that would give me too
much power so you say no
i didn't like that the music was still
going there that scared me
we shop wednesday babe wake up
new slay the spire episode just dropped
what time is it in vancouver because i
thought usually they came out at
9 00 a.m but it's like 8 00 8 15.

well thank you
much appreciated appreciate it thank you
i mean we gotta i actually agree
wholeheartedly with chat
and thank you handsome pants tm we will

hush fight like
we're here you got to do it
bumbo no this is my money say it for me
one more time
it's my money and i want it now
okay i don't love either but
this is a little spicy but i'm not
scared hey
thank you for the gifted subs as well
thank you
uh this is pretty bad but we do have a
holy card already
let me see we got we could get another
holy card in there
i feel like we should just donate not
for luck necessarily because who cares
but more just to like have some kind of
legacy on this run
like i feel like mr me is okay for
damage dealing but i think i'd rather
just
wipe the the trash enemies
and uh get the jar of flies charged up
instead i think it's much better
and then i'm trying to think here our
luck's so high like i bet this is just
gonna give endless punches yeah that
that's really cool
all right
it sounds awesome
[Laughter]
oh but three dollar bill man
there we go
hey sue's r thank you for the gifted
subs as well
what a run man okay don't forget
yo you can actually push this this hush
i thought he was anchored
we have a chariot card if we get hit and
things look bad
don't forget throw some flies out there
i mean technically i suppose we could
use
chariot to try to protect
the the holy card to begin with
the damage is kind of incredible huh
use the flies i was gonna pop it i was
like i'm scared i should have popped it
earlier
okay it's fine it's fine just generate
flies
he's done we did it all right so we've
lived
[Laughter]
that's that's a tough uh thing to get
off the posted note that's pretty solid
now we took the polaroid i can see it
there okay so we took the polaroid
hmm
that goes to the void
um but we could do the chest
and then also get the void anyway
it's only a 10 chance yeah but like
i do why not like the odds of us winning
are
super low but let's give it a try
you know let's go for maximum zaniness
we got to be mighty careful about three
dollar bill
and we absolutely need
a holy card and like you just get
tele-fragged by delirium
[Laughter]
scary scary moments chaos card
it it doesn't it and this is like i'm
going by memory
it doesn't um kill
delirium it does a lot of damage but i
don't think it kills delirium anymore
okay i think we should also i i'm being
a dummy all
money should go to bumbo so he can maybe
pay out with the chest
it doesn't do anything okay it's good
intel
sad intel but good intel spicy room
and the knockback's a little dangerous
here huh
the damage is actually incredible though
you got something for me bumble you got
something for me
he could drop a holy card he's just
waiting till we get to the
the boss and he's gonna drop two of them
just wait just wait
no thank you
to a spades baby can of corn
yeah i don't really know the full effect
of the punches like i don't know if the
punches do more damage or if they just
have knockback but
they hit multiple times shh beats me man
beast me
now you got me excited though and that's
the dangerous part right uh
okay okay okay
okay i mean why don't you eat it yeah
you
i shouldn't have taken your money my bad
but they got me excited like like
there's a chance to actually win this
one
if i commented on this video and said
fart pog
would you click the heart button i will
tell you i would not
click the heart button on a comment that
simply said fart
pog
you gotta do a little bit better than
that
if you what you could do is do you know
that classic like
weirdo horny james joyce uh



we've done like nothing with kane i
gotta tell you
i love the cane runs man but then oh the
back seating is so
much okay let's here we go here we go
let's try
let's try a tainted judas okay
check this out um free curse room
baby yeah i gotta learn some recipes
with kane
every time i do like a dark uh not dark
but a tainted cane run
people are like why doesn't you just
make seven steam sales and i'm like
because i don't know what makes them and
then they're like it's really simple
it's just
eight disparate ingredients in a very
specific order and i'm like i
don't remember that i can't read oh
these are
balls of steel
that's the wrong button oh hello jay
jay i almost cracked yesterday
i almost cracked and got the early
edition
mlb the show the only reason i didn't
is because uh in my head i was like i
literally am paying 30 bucks for early
access
not even gonna stream it and then like
it's gonna be on my xbox which i
i have in the other room generic name
57 thanks for the gifted subs thank you
so i'm just i don't know when i'm gonna
play it i i'm
actually reaching the point where i'm
like i don't even know if i'm gonna play
it because i'm like i'm not really gonna
buy it for ps5
or am i gonna move my xbox in here i
don't know the answer yet but
we'll figure it out i've been enjoying
whenever i can pop in and see a little
bit of the show i've been enjoying it
stream it once for that tax return
what's the drawback that tainted judas
well i
i mean i think that that was a terrible
start
i think that the problem is you don't
start with any impressive stats
like regular judas starts with
unbelievably good uh
damage right he's got low hp but his
damage is amazing
whereas you know tainted judas is just
kind of like he's doo-doo but he has a
really good space bar item that's a lot
of fun
so it's a little it's a little touchy
for now but we'll we'll figure it out
i don't mind oh also you can only uh
you can only have demon hearts i didn't
know or spirit hearts at least you can't
have red hearts
low range as well there's a lot of
negatives apparently
i'm trying this this path here dd
mega doo doo that's not how it goes
i got to get it going in my head again
dd mega doo doo something like that
i know we've said it before like dd mega
doo doo is a real like um
it's a litmus test for your sense of
humor i think
if you don't find it funny you're
wrong
is my take on the subject
okay dark judas little spicy
little spicy do it yesterday
so we ordered some food to eat
on the balcony
because it was such nice weather
yesterday we ended up getting korean
barbecue
it came with a very uh you know some
korean barbecue it comes with like a
a couple of extra trappings um
this came with everything like it was
like almost the same accoutrements as
sit down
korean barbecue came with some lettuce
came with some samjong
came with some raw garlic cloves
and it also came with sliced korean
peppers i've i'm very familiar with them
it also
it came with some marinated onions and
stuff like it's some marinated radish
like it was really good
but whatever korean pepper they gave us
we got you know like some jalapenos are
like they're basically just like green
peppers and some jalapenos are like
habaneros this one was like
it was a bujjolokia come on man i was
trying to keep you alive
so i ate like one little slice of it and
and my mom got scared and said you're
moving with your auntie and your uncle
in bel air like i
i had to take a break from eating for
like five minutes it was too much
no that we didn't have any any green
onion pancake because that's like an
extra
charge is there too much food to begin
with too but
i do love the pajama though pajama
kimchi jun
it's one of my favorite korean foods
was it spicy on the way out as well
we're not allowed to talk about poop on
this show anymore after the time i
talked about
when i saw poop and i i thought it was
very healthy and then chad said you're
sick
you're disgusting you're gross so now
we're not allowed to talk about anything
in that even close to that realm anymore
i've never had korean barbecue is it
worth it
it's a tough question to answer you know
i think if you look at korean barbecue
exclusively as like the value of the
ingredients you're getting you're going
to be disappointed
as especially when it comes to service
like because you're cooking it yourself
however as an experience i really like
korean barbecue
and at the end of the day like
yeah you're like barbecuing your own
food but i would rather eat like a meat
feast than like a lot of other foods
to begin with so even though sometimes
i'm like this is more expensive than it
should be
i am also like i'm willing to pay it
because it's like i don't know there's
like some desire economics in there
you know what i mean
you're right i can't enter curse rooms
for free
maybe yes maybe not i don't know
no i guess what i'm trying to say is
like there's there's some days
where i would pay where the desire
let me let me rephrase the premium i'll
pay for a food is not based on the
you know unit cost of the ingredients
but is rather based on
how much i want to eat it if that makes
sense
so you don't evaluate it from a purely
rational consumer standpoint instead
you're like how much do i want this pork
belly inside of me right now
so true bestie
like there are some days like if you ask
me right now what would you pay for six
mcdonald's chicken mcnuggets i'd be like
250.
if you ask me uh you know a week from
now it might be 20 bucks
i knew i was gonna get tagged there too
it just depends on uh it depends on the
mood you're in
you know hello sin victor hello have you
heard of this character have you heard
of them
tainted judas have you heard of this
character
name of judas for a dollar named judas
we went through almost the whole stream
with very few memes i may have dropped
the occasional yes sir
that's bad damage
yes sir it's time for some new memes
yeah
i can't do like trade offer man
it takes too much brain power to come up
with
may i please have a your flat i feel
like my voice is kind of fried for some
reason but uh
i'll hit you with the you know you got
no talon
you're flat you're not an artist
an artist has respect for the silence
that serves as the foundation of
creativity
i have to do that one when asked because
it uh it's one of the only impressions i
do where people say
wow that's actually kind of good
although i will say we must have a large
new audience lately
because um i i did my michael kane voice
in a video
and people were like yo loki his michael
kane voice isn't that bad
oh no my holy manson
and i was like dude that's from like way
back in the day
we used to do michael kane voice all the
time i i don't have a werner herzog
impression and i very much wish that i
did
because i it's it's less about the voice
which is just kind of like deadpan
german
and much more about like having to come
up with the stuff that werner herzog
says in the moment which is like
you know you do not respect the silence
that serves as the creativity the
foundation for creativity i can't
i can't get it man
i would like to see the baby
michael kane your flat is it in my head
it feels a lot easier than michael caine
um
all right i guess i'll be dead then um
then michael kane um
yes sir it's a tough character here
because the michael kane anger is
actually easier to do
like michael caine ordering uh a
sandwich is a little tougher
i'll have a bacon egg and cheese salt
and pepper ketchup mayo on
a roll
yes sir alright captain
come on man
you don't respect the silence that
serves as the foundation of creativity
you don't respect the silence no it's
we're not quite there
we're working on it though we're working
on it okay hold on
hang the man
yes sir sorry
thank you you stopped
just dropping in date indeed bacon egg
and cheese
salt and pepper catching may i want to
roll indeed
i almost forgot the bev
master wayne would like to cop the airy
yes sir
indeed you
already know the vibe plus two yo
this thank you appreciate it appreciate
it
i told you we almost wrong card we
almost made it to a
wrong function we almost made it through
without any memes
pudge is a butcher he eats human mate
get this dude i saw someone wearing a
dota 2 backpack yesterday
i didn't like say hi or anything because
by the time i saw their backpack had
dota 2
on it they were walking away from me
which makes
you know pretty logical sense when you
think about it but
i was like how about that dota 2.
dota
templar assassin templar assassin
templar assassin
i don't believe it was arteezy or
owie 2000 um but if i'm being honest
like i don't think i would
recognize them in the first place
it was not dendi um i i could tell you
with authority it was not dendy
you ever think that dendi looks a little
bit like linus tech tips
or is that just me i see like can you
put dandy face no space yeah that it
kind of looks like
like lioness to me man not at all i
don't know i see it
i definitely see it
okay with it this is the one we're
storing up for something beautiful here
i'm not saying it's a hundred percent
but you know
like there's there's a resemblance is
all i'm trying to say
like in 26 by 26 pixel
they're basically like identical twins
yo by the way i was watching i know why
people have a problem with like the
genetic testing services like 23andme
because you know they'd apparently sell
your genetic information to the
the government or like the police force
but anyway hear me out here's why that
might not be such a bad thing
i watched a cbc documentary on them they
had identical twins
do those um you know 23andme
ancestry.com type stuff and uh
they get out of here
saved uh the results returned
different things for both twins even
though they have identical
uh genomes obviously
which is is crazy you know like for one
of the twins they were like hey
like you're like 75 north italian or
something like that and then for another
one they're like whoa
you're from the byzantine empire you're
like what the heck is going on
i'm not saying it's completely a scam
but
it seems unreliable
what if they're not actually twins
okay so like how would this happen
because like i'm assuming they were born
at the same time
you know what i mean
switched switched at birth you can't
just say it you have to have like an
explanation does dropping
bud blood bombs hurt you
what happened there
only if you have no bombs dude i didn't
know
sometimes the stork miss delivers that's
true
yeah i just feel like now i'm like i
didn't want to do it in the first place
but um now i'm like man i definitely
don't want to do it cause like
it just seems like it's not reliable at
all
if you don't have bombs it takes from
red hearts it's kind of interesting
though
um bad uh still pretty bad
anyway that's that's all i got that's
that's all i watched
why don't you do the test twice and
determine for science sake
i mean i could i mean i'm interested in
like i don't i don't consider it like
part of my personality i guess
but i have absolutely no idea like where
my ancestors
were from i could hazard some guesses
but like
you know i i know that like my great
grandma on my mom's side
lived in england and then apart from
that
it's like it's canada for for
generations apparently
be interesting to know but now knowing
that the test is unreliable
it's like what's the point
i'm just hoping it says i'm from uh i
was trying to come up with a good answer
yodenheim there we go
jolkenheim that's a pretty good joke
i'll give you that one say yes recently
got family tree info
from sweden all the way back to the
1500s
that's very interesting i mean i think
it just shows you like um
like how different life was back in the
day
because like now it seems so crazy it's
like how did you
like not have records that were
preserved of like you know
everybody what their name was what they
did for
work and like where they lived and stuff
like that and you're like oh well
actually in like the
15th century we were all trying to
survive the bubonic plague so
you know and none of us knew how to read
or write so sorry about that
sorry like we uh you know preserved the
bloodline and you know
kept an unbroken line of heredity that
led to your existence
uh i wish that uh we had written
something down though
sorry nope
uh excuse me stand-up comedian the
premise of your joke is off by
almost 100 years i'm gonna need you to
take that one back to the lab please
okay actually like the matchstick
mine was accurate from 23andme yo
but but yo though like how do you know
take me down how do you know
23andme living rent free ancestry.com
has been real quiet since 23 and me just
dropped
yeah do you think i i want to test
something here this is a chat
piece of intel so you should be
skeptical to begin with
but what if we enter dark arts and then
place a bomb
i guess it doesn't matter here at all
because uh
we have bombs but like i wonder if it
would give us immunity to the damage we
take
my guess is probably not and we're
probably
like like now i'm in a situation where
people are like you might as well try it
but to try it like i have to throw away
my existing bombs just to possibly take
damage and i'm like ah
i feel like that's like that's not a
might as well that's like a
maybe next time
saved okay this could be the one
careful careful
if it works as infinite bombs yeah but
we have as many bombs as we could need
right now
you know as long as we don't come across
too many tinted rocks which doesn't seem
to be too much of a problem in hard mode
this character is a trip man
can you even place a bomb in dark arts i
i know i i don't even want to
test it because like i'm worried that
i'm gonna
pop out of dark arts and just
immediately take damage to my own bomb
you can place in in dark arts okay
there is that okay so there's one lesson
learned
it it definitely it made the
sound like it hurt i don't know if it
actually did hurt though did anybody see
if we lost the heart
it did f okay well you know what
it was clever at the very least it was
clever
at least they can go all path i don't
know like it's one of those things where
i probably shouldn't but
at least i could if i wanted why
shouldn't i have it
yo did you see amazon cancel this lord
of the rings mmo
did you see the second piece of news
related to that the news that amazon was
at one point making a lord of the rings
mmo
hi oh uh i just i learned at one point
i'm sure i probably just forgot
um it's a good opportunity for a dunk
though you got to admit
hey hey wrench is done no offense i'm
interested i
i meant to say no offense i apologize
it wasn't my intention
okay i would like to get a bomb
we will enter the realm of mirrors
i'm telling jeff yo jeff's on his way
out
i forget the new guy's name but we'll
have to learn it to you know make the
jokes relevant again
my name is uh jeffery heffy cafe bezos
andy jassy that's right i knew that andy
jassy
don't worry i'll use telekinesis can of
corn and i'll be i'll be fine
okay i am not going to fight this boss
because this boss could easily kill me
i'm just happy to get my second bomb
that's telekinesis kyle
you can totally be a ceo named andy
maybe you've
heard of uh andy carnegie
probably more andy ryan from bioshock
andy bernard he was never ceo he was
temporarily the regional manager
andy roddick ceo of coming in fourth
place in every major tennis tournament
in the
early 2000s that's not even a
burn fourth place is pretty good he
carved out a nice career for himself
oh baby now we're talking
he won a us open once yeah only because
serena wasn't playing that year
yeah yeah yeah yeah do it do it
dude i don't dislike a question mark
because a question mark could be
anything it could even be binky for
example
okay this is a great time yeah yeah
that's how you play it man oh it doesn't
work it doesn't work on bones my mistake
that is not how you play it no sir
it kind of worked it kind of worked
i'm not what am i doing my head's not in
the game right now get get back in here
it's because i expect to be doing more
damage than 3.5 by the time we get to
the mines one dude
just brief invincibility we're using
coward katana strats
dark arts boosts your damage yeah but it
freaking sucks kind of though like not
really but
like sometimes the dark arts doesn't do
enough damage to kill the enemy in the
first place it buffs you to five damage
it's still not enough to deal with these
enemies down here man
we need more we need more
okay just just a quick quick telepathy
and i'll be fine quick telepathy and
i'll be fine
we got it actually like a pretty nice
defensive run right now
saved saved
i almost got in there unfortunately i uh
didn't
okay no this is it's gonna be fine this
is the floor we're gonna get godhead
do you ever get sick of playing video
games
um i would say kind of is a good answer
there
like there are times on my day off that
like i want to play a game i'm like oh
i've been looking forward to like just
no lifeing slay the spire for like 45
minutes or however much time i get
um but then like there's a lot of times
where i'm like man i would rather just
like
take this opportunity to like read a
book or something right
now it happens a lot like with
increasing frequency
but like there's there's not been many
days where i've like gone live and been
like oh i'd rather be doing something
other than playing a game on twitch
i've never been like oh just for today
i'm actually gonna like
i mean we have enough like non-gaming
content via sporkl and
you know weird personality quizzes and
stuff like that that doesn't uh
doesn't come up too much
hot tub stream i didn't know there were
enemies on this room that's my bad
we can't talk about the hot tub stream
chib is here
he's a big fan i mean i said it before
as well i don't care
who cares man
i i was looking i i think it was on the
twitch rivals tweet
it was on some twitch tweet that i read
like this week or this weekend
where it was like they announced
something nice or something that i
thought was nice and people were like
yeah but did you know that like this
lady's in her bikini in her hot tub
so what oh it's distracting me from all
the people i normally watch
uh that are opening 35 000
worth of fifa packs instead you know
honorable content
it's crazy
uh i'm trapped
i'm probably one of the greatest gamers
i never had a choice frick
i forgot he explodes
you know sometimes you just get lucky
i'm just sad that twitch is turning into
a website we shall not name
it's like it's not though like just
don't watch it
like i literally wouldn't even know that
that kind of stuff existed if chibley
wasn't constantly talking about it in
the back channel
like if it wasn't for the fact that
chibly like every day he's like oh check
it out
[Laughter]
it literally wouldn't wouldn't even
enter into my mind
and no i need hp you can't do this to me
i need hp
needed those spirit hearts
i do kind of like golden blood bomb
it's got a cool vibe
there's hp in the shop wait really oh
there must be yeah thank you
it's always on the front page it's hard
not to see
i literally have never come across it by
accident i hate to be like you know
it's a you thing the thing that annoys
me is every time i go to the home page
to find someone to host
twitch is like hey would you like some
copy written music
and i'm like no get get get the
like i forget the name of the twitch.tv
slash ultra or something like that i'm
like get it out of here i don't want to
get
it's it's always playing country music
like last time i went to it it was
playing that you know one two three
gonna come back to me
because baby into x's and o's you'll
find me
and i'm like dude this stop trying to
dmca me
i don't want it get out of here get out
of it get out of here
go kill you uh that guys let's go
okay we got we got to focus we actually
have a chance here
i thought that could work dark arts plus
mom's knife seems
insanely powerful
you're my friend my mistake
yeah i don't know i feel like i mean i
don't know i mean
maybe i'm the problem but for the most
part i really like don't care what
anybody else does with their twitch
stream
i don't think you should be like you
know like murdering people or like
you know beheading them or you know
stuff like that and maybe that's where i
draw the line
i'll use my credit card
that's i used credit card accidentally
clip farming
consider your clips farmed
don't take my telepathy charge it takes
seconds to get it back
just check it i've got a feeling this is
hero funky
donkey dunk
donkey dumb
yeah jay i think you got it all figured
out man if anything i actually
appreciate that there's
like lightning rod streams for the horny
viewers because like
the less horned up viewers i have i
think the happier i am
in general so as far as i'm concerned
it's like a public service
if everybody could just like get rid of
their horniness before chatting i would
be so much happier
and their anger as well but that you
know we'll start like one
one emotion at a time you know we need
we actually need a range upgrade
that's where it started that horrible
smile
well yeah i want you to be like a
taboola rosso when you when you come to
my stream
i gotta stop getting cards man because
it makes it
so much more annoying to use dark arts
because you gotta toggle
i want you to be like an empty vessel
for me to
inject laughter into
he said the word wrong taboola um
help help twitch support a wrench is uh
mocking me i'm being cyber bullied by an
employee
okay this boss is probably like the
toughest boss for us right here
any other boss we touch them with the
knife they're gonna they're gonna
explode they're going down
this boss is like is made to counter
i'm a genius i'm simply the smartest
made to counter our high damage build
well done well well played
yo just [__] relax man
this is the worst still because i gotta
keep two two spirit hearts
are you kidding me the dodgers i gotta
keep two spirit hearts just to
sneak through the freaking door
please give me uh binky binky
pajamas binky pajamas nine lives binky
pajamas
look i wish man i wish
name a health item
oh no dude it's 355.
we're gonna go a little longer than i
thought
yeah man i don't know i mean i don't
know what people are like mad i've never
heard a coherent case for it
but then like secondly the only thing
i've heard on occasion is the
the idea that maybe like it makes it
harder to get discovered on the platform
and i'm like
buddy it's impossible to get discovered
on the platform anyway
people like me are soaking up all the
attention
it's a it's a front loaded game to begin
with
uh hp please
truth is the game was rigged from the
start
secret room second secret room you know
what no this is genius
i'm an idiot actually is stupid
this is not a good chance
this is now we have 16 bombs but
that probably can't be a regular secret
room
if i go to the mausoleum i'm gonna die
but if i
die i'll end my stream on time
so there is that
i'm so mad
um okay you're right right you're right
sneak into the curse room
who could have possibly predicted that
happening man
can of corn
cursed room curse room
we need the knife piece too right i know
like
there's some debate on this issue oh
careful there you go
but uh like some people say mom's knife
opens it automatically but then
anytime that gets brought up um
people go like that's not true actually
so i don't know if it's misinformation
or just good old-fashioned like um
ill-mannered trolling
that was just an anti-birth okay
that's some nasty trolling man because
that's not even like an
instant payoff that's like you don't
know that
the payoff happens until like 20 minutes
later
it's just mean-spirited
it's like telling someone like to get
into harvard all they got to do is like
you know get 82 in biology
excuse me thank you that was huge and
then they get 82 in biology
and you're like oh actually plus your
100 hours of community
service also harvard's closed
this year okay well that sucks
the old harvard can't come to the phone
viewers made cobalt lose his holy mantle
card
or his holy card is tainted lost i'm
telling you man it's a it's a streamer
versus youtuber
uh it's a streamer versus viewer world
out there
you got to be careful so you got to you
got to know your audience man
you got to learn names uh kobe
uh it's the greatest card of all time
well worth it
i think i tried to get in the gap i
tried to get in the gap
not strong not a strong performance
we will die if we go to the alt path
it's true i can't troll him now that nl
knows my name yeah and
look you're not on notice because you're
you're like internal vip status dan
but like the other side of that is
i believe earlier in the stream when i
chose to take
abaddon or i chose not to take abaddon
to take guppy's tail instead
i said i think this will be better for
me and then you
said yeah who needs a damage upgrade
very sarcastically and then in my head i
was like i'm making a note of who said
that and then i saw it was you
and i was like all right you popped your
holy mantle
sarcasm shield but
be aware note taken
i'm just trying to figure out how we're
going to get through this man
so i think here's an option it's high
risk but
start here
take a pill
take this mom transformation
does the mom transformation give you uh
does it give you what you need does it
do you need the key piece i guess we
already have the key piece so who cares
it's just
academic um
okay next step you walk into the room
you pop the pill
we're doing it anyway i never had a
choice
got a little lucky for sure
but we still got to get out of here
without getting hit honestly i think
i've learned my lesson and i think the
lesson
that i've learned is that like just
treat
tainted judas as if he doesn't have dark
arts
and then you're gonna be at least when
you get a run like this that's already
strong to begin with
and then you're gonna be fine
we can still use some damage don't get
me wrong
so good and tasty saved
i also and this is going to come across
maybe a touch whiny i'll acknowledge but
um
i do feel it's
it's a little easier you know what easy
come easy go
um it's a little easier to use
uh dark arts on a controller versus a
keyboard
like having to hit q while also
you know dodging with wasd and then
trying to run into enemies with it it's
just slightly trickier
i'm not saying it's impossible but like
as your as your tendons get older and
older
you start to be like is it even worth it
to hit the button now
that's kind of where i'm at i mean we
got no choice man we gotta
we gotta head down here
maybe the door won't kill you
hold on it's we could still get all no
yeah we could drop a trinket on the mom
fight and be uh and be fine here
the key rebinding of isaac now we're
talking
i'm only 20 and this guy makes my my
fingers hurt
i hear you i'm scared
i i need i need range thank you
there's just honestly like some things
that you're like i don't even know if
it's worth it man
like there's games i've played before
that make my hands hurt just to use the
controller and i'm like
that's that's a young person's uh folly
there
it's not for me
like i don't know how anybody that
played or still plays competitive smash
bros
i don't know how they still have like
functioning hands and wrists
or yes starcraft oh my god man
i can't even imagine
beats me isaac i think we're you know
different breed
i think the controller is just ergonomic
you know like i
at first you know when people were like
to use a controller or keyboard i
thought i had like
a superiority complex or something right
i'm like
of course i use a keyboard it's just the
superior like input method
as i get older i'm like man i really
wish i learned how to play on controller
first i think
i think it's probably just better for
your ah
risk long term okay well



oh hello everybody it is
sunday april the 18th 2021. welcome back
another great uh week of streaming
in the books and another great week of
streaming
ready to go really big really big shoe
ready to go oh twitch rivals champion
who put that in the title
who put that in there it's true yeah
it's true
it's true that i want twitch rivals
that's true it's that
that's not a falsehood so sure yeah i
mean i guess if you're gonna put it
there
and that's okay slash marker first
tainted keeper run
that's right we're doing our first ever
tainted
keeper run i know absolutely nothing
about what is happening uh with this
character
genuinely i have no clue but i did just
unlock the tainted keeper let's go take
a look in the
better shots greed is good look at that
2 2 2.
what could be greater than than golf
with a gator
excuse me four shots instead of three
item rooms now
cost money
all enemies give money when they
and it enemies drop money but then if
you don't pick it up immediately you
you lose it it's temporary money okay
you got it you got to be faster i'm i'm
embarrassed by my own
inability to to get any of that money
there okay oh you know what it is curse
of the dead gods dude
it's curse of the dead gods hey let me
in
oh my god i'm very upset
i'm highly perturbed would you look at
that okay hear a fun
love to see it dude i always play
aggressive in isaac anyway
so i can only imagine that this kind of
gameplay will benefit me
i don't see how it could possibly go
wrong we do also start with two hp i've
just noticed that's scary
that's a scary that's a scary thought
music is a little minkus can i tell you
a story
um i need the money
thank you uh i
thought that like when you say music's a
little minkus i'm sure it's
speeding up slowing down speeding up
slowing down um
i thought that that was just something
that chibly did on his stream like
whenever he would play music for me
it would it would get all like warped
and stuff like that and i thought that
was kind of like his thing
he's you know he's a zany guy i thought
he was like let's play this cursed
version of uh
of a top 40 song so that i don't get
content id matched that seems like an
unbelievable item
um and that yeah that means your video
has lagged it turns out that that's just
a that's a twitch thing sometimes i hear
people
in chat and they're like oh you know
like anybody else like his voice sounds
weird and i'm like
bro you're just in you're on like a high
latency mode or something i don't know
a little spicy a little spicy i don't
care i don't care okay
so there's the d8 the d8 i don't care
for as much as i care for the speed plus
damage right here
he do be sounding scottish though
donkey um shops can have items from all
pools like chaos too
yo that's that's insanely cool
that's great intel if you'll excuse me i
need to pick that up
we've seen the re village trailers i
literally
have seen no marketing material
on on resident evil 8
resident evil village except
fan made lady dimitrescu
lady dimitrescu being uh
ten feet tall and having like an
absolute
uh dump truck you know what that's the
only marketing material i've seen and it
comes from the fans
i need to get the money if you will
excuse me you you are you harboring
currency inside of you that's incredible
would you look at that
the game markets itself i suppose
i mean i i i'm not i guess i should say
i'm surprised it's taken so long for a
more triple a franchise to embrace
horniness i know there's been some
examples in the past
but um indie games on steam have
embraced horny
in a long time if you look at steam 250
which is like a it's a different way of
i don't know contextualizing steam games
instead of just user reviews
um it shows like you know what's
trending what's popular blah blah blah
what's not popular but has been very
well reviewed
um there is uh
a a tab called like under
appreciated that was just horrible
damage
um and literally every single one
of the uh under-appreciated gems is like
a
hentai visual novel now i say that
without having actually clicked on them
which i know it sounds like yeah sure
but you can just ch tell from the the
panel art and also the title the title
is always like my summer vacation and
you're like oh that sounds like it could
be kind of interesting
and then it's like an outrageously large
large breasted
purple haired farmer lady and you're
like okay i know what's going on there
you can't sneak that by me
please thank you
some of them are just called like horny
for sure
dude this is incredible this is amazing
very good thank you um
i'm gonna be honest i i don't know how
much i actually care for
um like mom's bracelet here but i
actually i
in in hindsight i think i care about it
a lot i don't care for the range too
much
but i care for the bracelet because if
we could get um
i'm happy with my range honestly um
because if we can get swallowed penny
this run could just be
like one already like look at this
just by all this is why
your your number one steam wishlist game
should be you need a budget
just because you have the money doesn't
mean you should buy useless stuff you
know
you got to analyze what's actually
important to you
now if we end up dying due to a
demonstrable lack of range
so be it it could happen
it's a it's a calculated risk i'm
willing to take look at that okay
didn't you buy an air fryer an air fry
fryer is a million times better than a
range upgrade
it's not even close they're not even in
the same
like value class to to be slight like
in the slightest i should say
plus if anything i'd actually rather
have like a range down
because excuse me um i want to get
closer to enemies
so that i you know i don't have that
impetus to not pick up the pennies they
drop
sorry chad i rustled his jimmies no no
not true just uh took your comment as
fodder in order to generate a little bit
of humor early on
on a sunday morning here it's no
antagonism
i mean if there's antagonism on your
level then you know that's
that's a you thing but uh
on my level we're copacetic look at that
now now i've wrestled my own jimmies
isaac is 124. honey pop is 119
on the steam 250. well i that's
kind of like you know how there's stats
and there's advanced
um in in sports
i really feel like we need to have like
an adjusted
for horniness rating for um
i'm stupid um an adjusted for horniness
rating
on steam and on steam 250 for that
matter as well
um you know what there you go
consider yourself placated sit yourself
because something about uh like
horniness
for steam reviews elevates a
mediocre game to good and a good game to
great and a great game the masterpiece
there was a rock back there okay hold on
let's check
let's check
let's check it's not this one right if
this is a crawl space that'd be
incredible
i do not see a tinted rock i have been
lied to i believe
i'm saying that the people that review
horny games
are into the game predominantly for the
horniness
and as a result
he was right it's in the item room i
don't know man like at some point we
just got to move on right
um plus why do i care about attempted
right i guess if it has small rock it's
okay but we i gotta get some
conversational momentum here
um bad start bad start but a potentially
good deal with the devil
15 cent brimstone don't mind if i do
seven cent money equals power
now i can be mad that i was uh
this probably doesn't work but let's
check it's a damage downgrade okay so
we're stuck
um let's try to do alt path man let's
try to do alt path tainted keeper this
this could be an incredible
get here um take me down to the next
floor this is unbelievable
but um i'm saying that i think that the
people who review horniness they're like
single-issue voters
right as long as the game has horniness
they're gonna vote it up in the metrics
and uh
it leads to a skew i'm not mad uh we
should be picking up the money by the
way
i'm not mad at the skew i'm just saying
that i
personally would enjoy a uh an
adjustment
to the waiting
it would be more useful for me as an
individual but there's some selfishness
in there for sure
okay oh my god at least we got the five
cents
like
oh some plum thank you
i haven't had plum in forever
if if he wants to go in he can go in
otherwise i'm
and there goes tomo going out as well
here we go yo
piggy bank could be pretty good here no
problem there
how's that range upgrade working out now
we're talking
i told you we didn't need the range
upgrade but chat
you didn't listen i would like the black
rune
thank you um
yeah we do need to not die
on the alt path um
like second knife piece run that would
be a devastating way for this to go but
definitely also
plausible
no i didn't see the f1 race today like
can i tell you how my morning went
it wasn't that bad i'm not trying to
complain but uh
what the heck's going on in here man
this is crazy
um we definitely want a key and then
let's just chill on this for a minute
let's think about it
so i got up at like 750
uh which is normal that's not unusual
for for baby times
and then like as i was going downstairs
to make myself a cup of coffee the
baby's
smart sock went off
which is like hey your baby is like in
trouble
so i ran into the nursery and then on
the nursery like
the baby was just chilling but i was
already uh
i had already been woken or like the
adrenaline had already hit my
bloodstream
like there's no way to buffer it out in
the other direction
so i i got up uh with a bit of a start
today
no no question there it's better than
any cup of coffee i'll tell you that
much
okay don't get shot here
good well done
yeah she was fine i did see i didn't see
the jake paul fight live because i would
never
um support that kind of stuff with my
with my dollar or my attention for that
matter i did see the result and the
gifts afterwards though
um and i saw some of the pete davidson
interviews
over the course of it as well
i'm not worried about that money man
just give me this money
okay don't forget the key piece
i mean i don't like uh i don't really
like watching
boxing to begin with if that makes sense
i i
like there's been times in my life where
i've been sort of like oh this is kind
of cool maybe i'll get into boxing but
like
i don't know i
like the same thing that people were
complaining about with this one which is
that there's like uh
you know 95 of the broadcast was
non-boxing and like concerts and stuff
like that that's what pay-per-views have
been like since i was a kid
like i would go over to my grandpa's
place when mike tyson was boxing
they would buy uh you know the mike
tyson pay-per-view
you'd watch three hours of the undercard
there would be like a 45-minute delay
mike tyson would step into the ring
knock out his opponent with like two
punches and then
you're like i just spent 50 bucks on
that
i mean i was like six but it's still
all right yeah yeah we're going down
we're going down going down going down
we got the night piece we're going down
yeah yeah yeah
uh well failed
uh wasn't uh wasn't all that i like
watching boxing highlights like i think
it's the sport where you don't actually
need to watch it the most
and instead you can just watch the gifs
now that gifts exist i will never
purchase another pay-per-view as long as
i live
i guess we should just do that there you
go
and then this
feeling like this is pretty good
i was laughing though like i i did see
on twitter there was this
guy who was like i guess like
who okay that's fine in fact it might
actually be good
um but i guess um there's like
like sports gambling is becoming so
popular that there's
like the same way there's okay this bid
takes a long time to get to i apologize
but at least i found some meat here
so like you know i've been into
investing for a bit and there's these
youtube channels that pop up
sometimes that are like i'm taking my
portfolio from like a thousand dollars
to a million dollars so
like i didn't click on them forever
because i was like i don't want to see
that
like you know fomo garbage to begin with
and then i finally clicked on one and
the dude's account like he started it at
a thousand dollars and now he's at 600
and i was like it's you know i'm not
happy that you're losing money but at
the same time i do kind of feel like
there's false advertising
go you're like road to a million uh just
just
mission accomplished maybe this seems
amazing
anyway you're like road to a million but
actually like you're you're down bad
right now
um help
but then there's a guy that i saw on
twitter who was like i'm i'm starting uh
my gambling road to 10
000 starting with one thousand dollars
and yesterday was his
first day with it
this seems possibly incredible
i should have known what that was but
that's fine um yesterday was his first
day
he put a hundred bucks on ben askren to
beat jake paul
and obviously uh that's not how that
that went down
so he's he's already starting from the
negatives
i just feel like it's a little
presumptuous to label your stuff
like you know road to whatever when you
have
when you've actually gone backwards on
the road
i'm not sweating the money by the way
because like to be honest with you
we're gonna get to 99 cents at our
leisure
i'm a little nervous to be honest about
the the explosions
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
but i i was talking about it in the in
our discord last night and i was like
you know i think and and i'm careful
with the way i say this because
obviously like there's some stuff you
don't have to hand it to him for
um but in some ways you have to
realize that jake paul has actually
monetized having the most punchable face
you could ever imagine
he basically sells pay-per-views because
everybody wants to see him finally get
knocked out
and then he just wins because he picks
his opponents like i picked my opponents
for twitch rivals then you're like
frick and you gave him like a like a
million dollars
and then you know like the same people
who are like i'm never gonna watch that
again
are gonna watch uh are gonna
watch the next one as well
okay hold on hold on we're down to the
next floor we're safe
get me out of here you gotta cut through
the noise
i mean by everything that i've heard
which is
little but still more than i'd like
is that you know jake's actually like
he's taking boxing seriously and then
like
to some extent
like i mean picking your opponents isn't
that like the greatest thing
ever like why would you ever
not want to pick your opponents if you
had the option
i please come this way i would very much
like to be able to get your coin
thank you
like it you know if if i was a boxer and
i could make like a
a billion dollars fighting people i was
guaranteed to beat
of course i'm gonna pick people that i'm
gonna beat right
it's it's like uh skill-based
matchmaking like it's way more
fun to win than to lose i have to
imagine in boxing it's even worse right
because
if you lose it's like somebody
physically beat you up
yeah smurfing exactly i'm not saying i'm
for it
as as the person getting smurfed on is
very
annoying but uh as the person doing the
smurfing i can totally understand why
they would okay
so in order to get through this door
safely
i think we're gonna give you one on and
pick up another
i was hoping maybe this would be hp as
well but
because we have piggy bank it's it's
piggy bank that's allowing that to
happen i think
let's go that was that was a good get
do you think you could take mouth in
boxing
honestly like it doesn't it would just
be a bad
fight
neither of us i think have any um
boxing experience at all or any real
fighting experience
at all it would like i would i would
just never do it it would just be
embarrassing
i'm sure both of us have pretty terrible
conditioning right now
i don't do the thing that like other
people do where they're like
i'm just automatically gonna bet on like
who's bigger i'm like
i think we're i think it would be a
pretty close fight because i think we're
both in pretty similar shape
i mean we gotta try that actually could
be insanely good with our existing
damage ted
why well just go all out man who cares
go for it number two
okay that's why you don't go for it but
either way like i'm pretty sure when i
press
the space bar for a single penny i will
generate
enough pennies to be completely fine
this seems really good
step on the button first
okay take me in stonks
no i'm not taking crooked penny you've
been watching too much dan
i'm i'm into the dopamine but i'm not
like a slave to the dopamine i'm able to
break the dopamine programming on
occasion
when things have to happen
dan is just he's lost in the dopamine
you know 10 out of 10 times sometimes it
it works out for the best
sometimes it leaves him adrift in a
notion of of neurotransmitter
i was just gonna say that's bad
not like this not like this
baited get baited you stink
baited don't walk on the spikes
baited
i'm not comfortable
[Laughter]
baited yo apollo
and five up thank you for the raid
i'm i'm inclined to say it
what the heck crawl space down here five
up
better than seven up anyone ever said
that before
i've been working on that joke ever
since i
well for about two seconds but
you gotta admit it's pretty original
when you consider what i'm beset on all
sides by right now which is
if i get hit i lose a run that i'm
guaranteed to actually win
how do i get to that
[Laughter]
i choose to leave
bro this sucks sorry thank you thank you
again for the raid i hope you're having
a wonderful time
hope you're enjoying yourselves in the
sin city but not too much
just give me a second here i'm a little
frightened
no reason this shouldn't be makeable
ladies and gentlemen saved i would like
to say that the man is saved i would
like to thank uh
i would like to thank honestly daniel
uh for uh teaching me how to throw bombs
with the best of them i really
appreciate that
uh were it not for the co-op that daniel
and i did a week ago i think i might be
in a scarier spot now
so i'm i'm very thankful for that now if
you'll excuse me
i'm gonna get a coin
now if you'll excuse me i'm going to get
a coin
and i'm going to live out the rest of my
days in relative comfort would you look
at that
funky dunk dunky dunk dunk donkey dunk
[Laughter]
ah easy easy game can of corn baby
can of corn he's done it all right
again thank you for the rate i apologize
i was mindful headed in the moment
i was also stoked you know hey it seems
like you guys are having fun
in in las vegas b um
obviously the the among us stream today
was doing amazingly well
okay i mean this is now
there's an upsetting level of power on
this run now
yo is that true the more
the more times you buy from shops
as the tainted keeper the more items you
get from the
shops in the future because if so that's
definitely amazing
that's also really good i mean i was
gonna say this not true
but then it's fake lore but then like we
did get like seven
things from the shop there
okay this room has caused me a lot of
problems in the past
perthro is really good though use your
brimstone please
i mean like but why
like we got a beautiful run here all you
gotta do is press
well okay this this room you gotta get a
little trickier but
because it's finite it's not fine if you
just pick up the coins you get from
killing the enemies
i honestly like i don't know why why do
i i invite this on myself here
i know what i'm doing in isaac just
chill out don't worry about it so much
have a good time kick back grab a
beverage
i promise you you know things are going
to turn out all right
you're worried about the things you
don't have to worry about and then
you're
you know you you don't pay attention to
the things that are of the utmost
relevance
like the banter banter is heavily like
oversold right now
oversold and underrated insubordinate
and churlish
see that's what i'm concerned about is
using brimstone and causing a situation
like that to come to pass
i think we do want this so we're just
gonna play it
real chill-like
we still got an item room we still got a
shop
i don't know why i would use a bomb
there there you go there you go okay
pope hat
kind of not that good we're gonna per
throw real quick
wait what not that interested
giant cell micro friends there could be
some merit there
okay this i think on regular rooms
yo hockey scar thank you thank you for
the gifted subs
regular rooms we're gonna try to do a
little uh
space bar non-regular rooms like bosses
mini bosses that's where
brimstone flies yeah like i know what
you're gonna say about this but the
brimstone runs actually have like the
same
problem or the brimstone shots have the
same problem
that we have with weight what which is
that we don't want to get close to
enemies after we kill them with
brimstone because our booger tiers like
then
explode
and charging up brimstone makes number
two work
so we gotta be a little gotta be a
little bit more conservative
here you think you're going to watch the
mighty ducks shows on disney plus
um
there's a about a zero percent chance
i don't have anything against the mighty
ducks you know it's just like
the show is made for for kids right like
it's a it's a children's television show
is that not correct i mean i i
in fact i should just consider myself
the authority on the subject because i
was of the age that watched the original
movies when they came out so
i know that they're for kids
if you'll excuse me i will be protecting
myself here
i'm trying to stay away from kids
television programming because i know
i'm going to watch like
an infinite amount as uh as our daughter
gets older
i would like those please none of them
no from all four
come on now please
ah it just slipped through my fingers
man
there we go there we go no no no no
okay dude i don't know this is like
so i think this is fine um
honestly i think we should double damage
in order to make our uh
in order to make magic fingers that much
better
why not take an extra shop i don't think
i want cricket's body cricket's body
just kind of scares me here
asus is nicer phd
a little luck upgrade never hurt anybody
okay
yeah i don't want qriket's body i think
that the the extra exploding
tears will kill me
i don't support it
i'm sorry i'm losing it a little bit i'm
having let me let me take a little hit
of the plum
it's crazy man what's up with the what
happened this weekend everybody in chess
losing their mind
it's crazy so much antagonism for no
reason
it's the brain worms man i don't i don't
know what's up
yeah i'm resisting the desire to turn
into the joker
i'm not always the best at resisting it
but i'm doing it right now as well
okay we're good to go we're good to go
mausoleum
you just open the door yeah
okay now we just chill very nice
buy things i don't know man
[Laughter]
i don't think we i don't think we buy it
honestly i think we're happier with what
we got
i don't think we need it i think we take
this
shoot open the door and we head down to
the corpse
okay sure to just
just crap on them
very very good very very very good
easiest money ever made okay down to the
next floor
quick little answers okay the only
problem that i have right now
is living
oh that was real bad
saved saved the only problem that i have
right now is living
on the uh
help on the actual boss fight but i
think the
actual boss is gonna die
super easily
we just need to not take too much damage
i would also like to
pick up enough money like
i want to be in a good financial spot
for the start of the boss fight
because uh we do get
yeah that's what i want to watch out for
i i shot a bomb with brimstone and it
exploded
um i want to be in a good financial spot
for the start of the fight so that our
damage is high and we can just mash the
space bar as much as possible
but hp is the most important resource
above
everything now the well i guess yeah you
know what you're right
the blood bank is infinite money here
because we have piggy bank
you're not wrong about that
you normally you can't do it um
let me just make sure it's it's good
here we have we have piggy bank we have
piggy bank so
it's nerfed now it's nerfed on keeper
normally on the keeper it didn't work
um without piggy bank it was a chance to
pay out i
thought that they made it so that it was
a guarantee
help uh with piggy bank but i might be
wrong
even with piggy bank is broken okay
that's a good lesson in greed i'd say
like don't uh
don't needlessly
try to make the run better when it
doesn't need it
just stick to your guns tier size
i don't know about that one all right
down to the next floor
a little more palumpa lumpum
just making sure the beams don't hit
each other
ideally at least
just get two okay just get one one is
fine
now this is a room where you just got to
be good
or preferably be able to fly that's fine
we're fine
who's your favorite tainted character so
far no joke i really like tainted lilith
i think it's a very cool way to play the
character
i dude tainted kane also extremely cool
the only uh tainted character that i'm
like
not that into is tainted blue baby like
i i got a lot to learn there
two of hearts is pretty good man and we
should check the other pill it could be
it could be full health
and i don't have tinted lost yet yeah
tinted azazel is a little oh it's
another lock upgrade
tinted uh azazel is a little uh
under uh we shouldn't say underpowered
but
i found him a little boring when i
played as him yesterday but
or on friday i should say
very good room
this is a big one man sorry brother
thanks for the damage though
i want it okay okay okay it's the boss
fight
i think i know how to play it just chill
out
land some shots we we don't know what
the hp looks like
don't forget to mash but
don't don't worry about it don't don't
overthink it here
good stuff okay get ready you got a
brimstone bean coming from the center
saved my man has learned how to play
took long enough
quarter circle
quarter circle pop it thank you
that hurts
don't get number two by accident
he's dead he's dead he did it okay easy
easy
no problem
cursed penny has appeared in the
basement big ups okay slash marker
surprising win how about that



all right let's keep it trying again
let's keep it going
i agree like i think we got pretty far
considering how
how terrible the run was i can't believe
we got proptosis like right off the
get-go
and then uh like almost nothing else of
value until the hush fight
okay this one's got a chance
firemind probably wasn't the right
choice but it's also like the only
reason we were able to make it to the
to the fight in the first place so it's
uh it's a tough call
proptosis is just average after the
nerfs
that i i did not know i mean it's it's a
cool looking tear effect and
sometimes it's better to look good than
to feel good you know
but the price of beauty is pain
okay just stay away
yeah it was still a damage upgrade but
like a very a very very minor one
like to the extent that someone in chat
was like why is your damage so low and i
was like is not we have proptosis and
then i looked at it and i was like oh
yeah
actually never mind you're absolutely
right
have i missed anything yet today um i
mean
it was kind of a fun run at least like
we were up against it in the last round
you haven't missed any unlocks or
anything like that
if anything it's a great time to show up
because i think you you just missed the
garbage run
we did spawn 50 grandfather flies on the
boss that was pretty cool
f did you enjoy the canucks game last
night
dude i was like so mad at um the
pre-game
rhetoric from leafs fans oh we're first
in the division but
everybody's out to get us you know we're
gonna lose to vancouver tonight and i
was like
there's no way you're gonna lose to
vancouver our whole team had the
coronavirus and the nhl rushed us back
just so
like you know they'd other teams were
complaining they're like what the heck
we
we have some games are left against
vancouver and they freaking stink
and then they're you're gonna cancel the
season no you got to let vancouver
feed us free win so we can get into the
playoffs i was like these guys like they
they have no idea what they're talking
about they're weird victim complex
despite
literally like 95 of all national sports
attention going to their team and their
team alone um
and then they freaking lost and i was
like you know what that's hilarious
i had a great time
wanna one of the better games of the
season for sure
okay on seuss
yeah plus it was the first time holtby
has played up to his contract like uh
the entire season
big ups
i mean canucks fans have it i'm not
trying to just rag on leafs fans too
much this is it's it's good
old-fashioned banter
canucks have more than their fair share
of annoying both media and fan base
and definitely a narrative of like oh
everyone's out to get us
but um it is annoying
it's the battle of like the fake
oppressed franchises when when vancouver
and toronto play
okay okay it's endlessly reusable
they probably leave after a room okay
they leave after a room
it seems pretty bad um
but we're gonna do damage with our wisp
when we run
into them so there might be something to
it i don't
you know it's like you get a little blue
candle
it doesn't okay well we're probably
gonna maybe not die on this room but
we're not looking great long term here
but
it's
not too particular it's not good i
should say
i mean you can create infinite fires but
like you got to be real careful about
where you land
and also like the fires can only shoot
in four directions so
i don't know we'll see full health
please you know
we've already been there but i
appreciate the thought range down
it's dark arts but worse it's called
dark farts
that's that's something where you're
going to want to go to the hospital for
sure if you experience that
if you have a visible fart cloud coming
from your body and you're not wearing
a thermal vision like sam fisher
then i would encourage you to seek
medical attention as soon as possible
you have more viewers than nasa right
now can i say something
i love nasa i bought many of their
shirts at urban outfitters to
show people how smart i am and how much
i freaking love science.facebook.com
but i'm not surprised i mean nasa
really really good at going into outer
space
streams 50 50 on the entertainment value
they're not there for entertainment you
know they're they're there to do science
and then they you know
they film it and sometimes they have
some commentary i've watched a few of
them
it's very cool but um yeah they haven't
done a single bit of gta
rp they've done no isaac no hot tub
streams so like
honestly like i'm inclined to say that
it might actually be like harder
to be entertaining on twitch than to go
to outer space
just just based on what i've seen
hey farticus thanks for the gifted subs
after that
that truly asinine take yeah dude what
if they played among us
on the international space station that
would pop
off joker
i mean it's
not particularly good but
well it's actually great okay well you
know what it's definitely better than uh
it's definitely better than how to jump
excuse me
i have uh what there's a bone tier huh
sea scrolls doesn't have kamikaze
anymore
haha you think about everything don't
you
nasa is pretty sick though they're one
of my favorite fashion brands
excuse me
don't move move move
does elon have a fashion brand you can
definitely buy
tesla clothing i think they also sold
like and this is before all the
speculative markets went like truly
insane
they sold like a tesla tequila or
something like that
and then people were paying like 200
bucks just for the empty bottle
you know what can you say pt barnum
it's immoral to let a sucker keep his
money
okay good stuff we're out of here
okay okay okay okay
that's what i'm looking for all right
all right get me out of here we're so
slow
i don't know man i don't know
we might be able to make it to hush i
really want to
um that that hurts
i gotta think about that one
dude this run is is so bad right now
but i'm thinking like if we got enough
spirit hearts we could use a billion
dead sea scrolls
on uh on hush and just destroy
him are we gonna make it to hush i don't
know but we do have a 100 chance of a
deal with the angel here so
so maybe like all we need is a couple of
good items
right now it's just it's slow man like
that's the
principal problem but one item could
make it work
what do you think of that look i can't
do it i'm still getting
probably like once every two weeks i'm
still catching flack on twitter
over when i made fun of elon for saying
um
i love music it makes my heart sing so i
i gotta be mighty careful
he's got an army of uh of proxy
defenders out there on social media
that can't take a joke but you know
people ask what do you think of elon's
rgb tunnel like
i i would love to see
a disruption in or at least an adoption
in like
you know rail travel in north america i
get that obviously like the continent is
huge and
like there's different islands of
population density and stuff like that
but i'm like dude it's just a little
tunnel that the car goes
slow in like i
like is it's actually presently
substantially worse than the road
and it's the pro shouldn't the prototype
be blowing people away
because it doesn't have to deal with
like real world constraints
i don't know it's anyway look i'm not
trying to he's
he's an innovator careful he's a hero
deck of cards baby
you know what i want more telepathy for
dummies thank you
i would love if the if the tunnel was
sick
man i'm not rooting for failure if
anything
i'm rooting for like me being shown the
error of my ways but when they did the
little tunnel thing i was like okay so
it's like a road
that's insanely narrow that a car can
drive on
at 35 miles an hour
that seems like really bad
i'm sorry does it maybe maybe it'll get
better from this point onwards though
i do also and maybe this is just
paranoia to some extent but like if one
of the cars
like crashes you're kind of just
like you're toasted right
i don't give look okay i saw the the
tesla fire
it took like 35 000 gallons of water to
put out
that's one where like see i'm not like
just
dunking on elon for street cred you know
like
two idiots were in the car had itself
driving with like no
supervision whatsoever um and then it
crashed into a tree at
highway speeds and lit on fire that one
i'm like
that as far as i'm concerned i don't
work for the transportation safety board
but that kind of seems like operator
error to me
okay i'm getting out of here ding dong
we gotta go a little faster
i gotta pick up the speed a little don't
take my charge
book of shadows okay we should be using
this on rooms hello by the way cobalt
hello
scroll could be mvp you know i mean we
have the expert here cobalt how's
um dead sea scrolls with bethany
have you ever had it
i'm i'm presently undecided
certainly better than uh how to jump
i walked on the spikes didn't i
oh
it's run winning yo
especially i'm trying to save up all of
our spirit hearts like if we could uh
if we could use like seven charges
against uh
against hush we're gonna be living life
man
i never touch uh dead sea scrolls
because it kamikazes me every time
he doesn't know uh cobalt i'll have you
know i discovered for myself i was not
told by chad i discovered for myself
that
dead sea scrolls has had the kamikaze
effect removed now
so every time you mention this just
remember
who told you
who came up with that beautiful piece of
information
exactly it's true it could be teleporter
because it just was
that's fair that's that's a good uh it's
clip farming
dude i was watching the news today so
there's this canadian company called um
nutrient and their ceo just resigned
they had to get a new ceo
just go look up what the new ceo's name
is
i promise you you would never guess it
naturally i'm just gonna tell you
his name is mayo schmidt
when i was watching the news i had like
a dd mega doodoo moment
where i was like his name's mayo
and i mean like mayo schmidt is just
it's a great name
maybe colonel mustard wasn't such a an
act of fiction after all
he is bald i mean he's like he's old
okay where we have 14 minutes catacombs
too
uh we gotta hit up our item room and
shop it's gotta be done
all ceos are old uh excuse me are you
forgetting about
uh elizabeth holmes from theranos
she's the next steve jobs
girl boss girl boss defrauding all of
her private equity investors girl boss
girl boss alert i don't know the girl
boss i'll leave that for chib if chib
plays siege today
what about doogie howser doogie houser
wasn't a ceo he had a much easier job he
was the chief of
uh chief of surgery and uh
resident cardiac uh surgeon
at sacred heart hospital
i did uh i watched the new shang chi
trailer
uh i watched it without sound on it
looks cool
see guys does he have super powers or is
he just really good at martial arts
looks cool to me or teaser i should say
he's both good at martial arts and super
powers
is he uh first of his name
the iron fist danny rand
i've never seen iron fist i just know
the jokes
we don't talk about iron fist okay my
bad my bad
dude what i'm curious about though is
whether or not i don't even know what it
does let's take it
um i'm curious about whether or not
chang chi is gonna
have any impact on the overarching
marvel cinematic universe plot of what
happens to
uh the falcons sister's boat
like i'm not really concerned about all
like the galaxy
like you know universe level threats and
stuff like that i'm much more concerned
about whether or not they're gonna get
the uh
the oxygen pump working properly and the
falcon in the winter soldiers boat and
like what the the implications are for
the rest of the marvel cinematic
universe
that would be it dude we could do a
recurring bit
remind me to do this recurring bit it's
like whenever there's a new piece of
marvel news
we could just ask but what does this
mean for the boat
okay we gotta we gotta go a lot faster
here
that would totally work birthright
sometimes means you get to use your
active item for free
yo that's pretty sick
wake up baby new just dropped yo
it's the silver surfer
what does this mean for the boat dude
the silver surfer could totally use
the skills that he come on don't give me
that choice again
the skills that he used um trying to
help galactus conquer the universe
to get a new bow or masthead
for the falcons boat you never know adam
guardians of the galaxy three forget the
quinjet baby we're going in the boat now
okay
dude like it's gotta be booker shadows
right like never mind okay we're gonna
roll
no it's gotta be book of shadows man
it's gotta be book of shadows
absolutely i regret nothing
emperor card yes i will
anyway that's all i got about uh marvel
i don't know wait waiting for new stuff
pretty excited to go back to the movies
but i gotta wait for my wife to be
vaccinated first
i gotta wait for me to be vaccinated too
but you know
could be any day now
as long as it's june right now is it
june no not quite june yet okay
well you know um we're we're on pace man
i'm not sweating this at all
old dan l would take nine lives in a
heartbeat yeah old nl also streamed
about 12 hours a week so
be careful what you wish for
old nl also took a lot more abuse from
the comments for making decisions like
that
like everybody they got all the
nostalgia because you didn't have to
deal with the cyber bullying
i was making zany decisions with like
tears in my eyes people with like
naruto uh avatars on youtube like i can
anyone else i
i hate watching this guy he's so
entertaining
but it i can feel my iq dropping from
its previous high of 273 every time i
uh click onto his videos
there is a wisp cap is it is it a wisp
cap
over
saved is it a wisp cap
overall or is it a wisp cap per type
all right so this runs great now okay so
spoilers
um the if you're not
familiar uh with the way the unicorn
stump works
with the wisps the wisps that you
make with unicorn stump are invincible
while you're in the unicorn stump phase
so like basically you pretty much just
run into enemies
and they will like all die it's gonna be
a great time
i had this on a on a run recently like
earlier today
and i also had sci-fly so i'm sure you
can probably figure out like how things
uh
how things went down
saved okay now we do also have uh
saved um 11 extra periods of
invincibility dude this is gonna be
this is gonna be good hush is still
gonna be annoying
no question there but uh not nearly as
annoying as he could have been
dunky dunky dunky dunk dude sci-fi is
is too good it's like unbelievable
no so the the wisps being extinguished
are the
the non-unicorn stump wisps and honestly
like
i couldn't care less about him to some
extent like
you know we're gonna have so much
unbelievable damage
just out of the unicorn stump that like
those wisps
pretty much irrelevant i think for our
cause
it hurts no it doesn't all right well
you know you keep the bickering to
yourselves
uh let's see if we uh
let's see what we have on the blue shop
save some keys yeah let's see what we
have on the blue shop save your money
let's just go fight mom the more damage
you take the more your rate of fire goes
up
yo that's pretty good
i still need dps you know like me
meet the new isaac same as the old isaac
i am still like you know for the second
run in a row basically at base damage
but
not gonna complain too hard we did also
get like the most broken combination in
the game
now the other thing so first off we
can't make boss rush because we're
already too late
but secondly there is a cap on the
unicorn stump charges
um or wisps i should say you can only
have like
maybe seven or eight of them around you
uh
and we'll probably still take the damage
i guess we'll be fighting you as well
mine is a terrible item to waste you can
hold 24 of them
that's that's way more than i thought
okay take the negative all right
dude i had a great item today have you
guys ever had soul
that item that threw me for a loop man
it was the exact
item i requested the existence of
i'm not gonna spoil everything that it
does if you haven't seen it but
when you uh kill a boss
it removes any curse on the floor which
is just like
for quality of life is just beautiful it
has some other effects that are actually
like more valuable than that but
just for like pure quality of life
that's the
that was the big one for me
i kind of want to go to the curse room
he's a genius
not sweating it yet not sweating it yet
not sweating yet
not sweating it at all
very nice
yeah we might do a little bit more
explorate wait can i leave this room
um
and still have access to the the hush
floor
i can never remember this minor stuff
no deal that's that's painful man that's
painful
okay while we have this incredible luck
stat we got plenty of time
well we got this incredible luck stat
let's um
let's go farm up some keys
some extra spirit hearts like anything
helps
what the is it my own my own shot
screwed me
it's like one of my my dead sea scrolls
shots
i don't know what hit me yeah i hate
hearing the muhahas man
bad memories i mean good memories but
scary memories
it was a green tentacle oh dude shows
what i know
oh just i just i might have to
turn off the security for my wife one
second i think she's got i think she's
got it
see i'm just waiting to hear if the
shrill alarm goes off and then
the police are called i think we're
saved okay
scary moment there
here's the deal all right i don't know
what this does but
we don't need immaculate conception
so let's take it soul lock it's
incredible
dude well you know what that's
incredible news heart locket is a
plus plus it gives you stats for every
soul heart you get
can i every soul heart you ever pick up
will increase stats yo
i mean assuming that that works with um
with bethany like that's amazing it does
oh my
oh my finally i
i have a reason to not be upset when
tinted rocks are called out
okay i'm just trying to get some keys
like that that's about it
can of keys and i'll be all right we got
five minutes for hush no sweat no sweat
time till boss rush approximately
negative five minutes and 12 seconds as
of the last check
that one might be uh and it's two floors
ago it might be impossible
hush is still on the table though
okay come on spirit hearts money's nice
you know we could we could still donate
a bunch
i don't know if we need to get our
donation machine to blow up again
or if you ever needed to do it more keys
seven keys
seven keys should be good all right i
think i'm ready to bounce man get me out
of here
now we can't step on spikes anymore and
now why did you decide to use
um keyboard or over controller
i guess i i it wasn't really like a
decision
when the game first came out like the
original flash isaac
all i had was a laptop so i just played
it
do it do it do it i'm not scared do it
uh i just played it like
on my laptop keyboard and then you know
when i moved back i was like i already
got all this keyboard intel like why
would i uh
mix it up and then uh rebirth came out i
was like i already got this keyboard
intel why would i mix it up
and now i'm like i wish that i had mixed
it up
because especially yeah yeah yeah yeah
uh some of the tainted characters i'm
like i
i think they're just a little easier to
activate everything uh
on the uh
hold on here a little easier to activate
everything on the
on the keyboard or on the controller i
should say all right all right
aura is really good it's a nice fire
rate boost already
this insanely good uh
now we get coins we get spirit hearts we
give stats we got a genuine
synergy engine nice little damage and
tears boost
nice little range boost justice
injustice
tainted loss greedier took me eight
hours oh
no i i've unlocked tainted loss and done
a couple of runs but i have not
i haven't taken it any further than that
unfortunately
okay so this should give us stats right
yeah yeah nice little damage boost
nice little something boost nice little
something boost nothing wrong there
then here i'm going to perthro i think
these are kind of stinky
conjoined not quite um
yeah actually i like this idea let's
start here blow ourselves up
by the heart there's a little speed
upgrade associated with it
nice little stat boost
i don't know i don't know how deep i
want to go with this uh
just bomb it up a little bit that's so
weak dude
i'll go i'll go until i get a damage
upgrade let's put it that way then we
can put the rest back in
there's our damage upgrade and then
we'll put the rest of the money back in
okay um bomb yourself again there's a
heart in the main room
yeah but you don't get the you only get
the stats for picking
when you buy things just picking up a
heart doesn't give you the stats
okay so after we beat
hush if we beat hush
we go to delirium yes yes
we try at least
always nice to check always nice to
check
yo just kidding all right
uh we have some fun here alright so we
got 21
invincibility definitely do not mind
using two of them just to get through
this is it gonna be enough no i think
we're gonna have to like do some
fighting
uh but i think it'll be fine
i might even just save as much
invincibility as possible and try to use
it uh only if i find myself in need of
death
or in need of avoiding death i should
say
or at least for like the harder attacks
to dodge what am i
some of my shots must be deflecting here
like some of my wisps maybe
you have the soul when the heck did i
pick oh yeah you know what you're not
wrong
i totally forgot
yeah we've had some angel rooms that's
for sure
the only run that i ever have a chance
of like remembering
the items that i have and keeping like a
coherent through line
is like um the first run of the day
every subsequent run from that point
onwards is like
the odds of of me remembering is is very
low
that's the mind no we got this we got
the soul in there
100 can of corn baby yo that's actually
like a
a lot more damage out of the
invincibility than i thought we would
get
yeah the follow-up runs they always get
lost in the brain juice i think that's a
good way to describe it
because you're like wait a minute was
this the same run where i got like eve's
crusty socks or was that the last run i
can't remember
hey man come on come on
yo the music is pretty sick so many free
charges
hey that that one cost us that one cost
us
that was insanely easy that one the last
one was free too
all right divine intervention has
appeared in the basement
uh i'll thank you for the range upgrade
as well thank you so much
uh and i think we'll just move on i mean
that was really good
duncan all right and these are like some
of the most difficult to actually get
done cobalt don't give me
gifted subscribers you have you have a
child
you got your own stuff on the go save
your mo like ing direct used to say in
the advertisements
save your money
i feel bad like i when i think it was
the first repentance stream
when i was like you know i'll give out
gifted subs for every loss or maybe it
was the last
after birth plus stream i felt bad
giving myself
gifted subscriptions
and like obviously a lot of that comes
back to to me
financially regardless
i was like man i'm so stupid why did i
you know lose and then you know
pay myself
big business moves baby
i'm trying to purchase on my ipad and
it's giving me an error look you know
whatever
you have to tell yourself i i understand
you know hey you
you could i told you you don't need to
feel beholden oh he did it
okay thank you cobalt
for you know i know i told you you
didn't have to but you're standing up to
the
the terms of the deal that you yourself
made and and there's a lot of uh
there's value and honor as well i
appreciate it thank you
and then we'll just keep trading them
back and forth
i'll make a bet i'll be like there's no
way cobalt's ever gonna beat mom
10 gifted subs in coming
we can just keep running that back and
forth
dude like every single one of these
fights
could be a huge floor or it could be the
the void
fight the delirium fight i don't know
what anything's called in this game
i don't even know what you are okay this
is fine
cobalt unban me please
here we go again well look i'm not
saying that cobalt is gonna unban you
but what did you do in the first place
to deserve
being banned let's not say deserve let's
say
you know to to provoke the ban
you don't have to answer but i'd like to
know
i find it funny
other chat trials it is nicer
like it's more fun to do on band
requests for other streams
because they don't hurt your feelings
they they only hurt the feelings of uh
of your friends
didn't come out the way i wanted it to
come out but
he called out a tinted rock i mean
honestly like
can you blame him for for the band like
it's gets annoying man
i'm not trying to you know sound like oh
like rude streamer or whatever but
there's you know you played
kobel's played in eternity of this game
as have i
sometimes people you know they have the
best of intentions but they they just
sort of don't
think about the fact that you know
you're talking to like
this is like the only game that i know
in my entire life and people are like uh
hey did you know if you get a battery
charge it gives you a full active charge
on your current active item and i'm like
i wasn't aware that's incredibly good
intel thank you so much i really
and then i've been watching uh like dan
play
and people are giving dan bad advice
like people are giving him advice that's
just like
like genuinely doesn't work at all
and then if you're like that doesn't
work they're like oh sorry
like i just thought if it did it would
be amazing and i'm like you're going to
throw this poor man off you know you got
1400 people in his chat you know if 100
people are saying some stuff he's gonna
think it's real
you gotta you know
you gotta understand you gotta know your
environment you gotta read the room
it's sharp plug i don't know like it
might kill us if we use it wrong but on
the other hand
it could be hilarious
okay any anything could be
um delirium at this point but i think
i'm basically ready
wow
okay uh spirit hearts please no so what
what is the there must be a percentage
chance on
like the soul heart penny right you know
what it is
feels like i'm gonna say 20
maybe it's luck based 10
i mean it's still really good
speed upgrade
anyway i support cobalt running the chat
however he wants to run his chat
you know it's it's the streamer's way
plus like i i mean i saw your tweet
cobalt where you're like
you know sorry sometimes i get
frustrated with like stuff being tough
in isaac
and i'm like dude you don't need to
apologize for that i hear you
you're just trying you got 12 billion
neurons just trying to like you know
focus on i got to drop a keep or i got
to drop a trinket and then i got to go
back forward and turn it into a cracked
key
and at the same time i got a you know
like there's 12
i'm using bag of holding and then for a
bag of holding i've got to make sure
that i've never
you know you get the idea
you know when you got that kind of like
cognitive load it's and you're playing a
difficult game it's much easier to
become irritable for sure
it's only because of my incredible stoic
nature and my numerous readings of
meditations by marcus aurelius that i
find myself
never being tilted by chat ever
you know but it's it's it's i can't
expect everybody to aspire to the same
uh
level of stoicism
okay this is working out pretty well
i think here's my plan for the rest of
this fight
i'm going to keep pressing the space bar
whenever
i am not multi-colored
and then the boss will probably die
and that'll be the end i i kind of
screwed it up there but
seems pretty good
yeah it turns out like unicorn stump
pretty good item
this is good though this is a hard
character to win with man this is
it's a nice one to knock off the list
i just need a little water star of
bethlehem has been unlocked
how about that do i haven't seen that
ending in forever and that's how it's
gonna stay
all right how are we doing on bethany
okay so that's that's
greedier mega satan
true uh all true ending dude we gotta
try
i gotta i gotta hit you with a slash
marker first but slash marker
end of bethany run we got



gotta try man i don't know maybe we you
know what
let's let's do tainted jacob tainted
jacob is fun
one moment please i'm just looking at my
my discord messages i apologize youtube
but it is uh
it is as the french say les important
okay just getting the siege group
together now we're playing siege at uh
two so we got an hour and a half hour
and a half and i'll be all right all
right
so how the heck
does uh tinted jacob work one minute
into every single floor
he spawns uh the devil i can't see what
the item is
ed please fix your game just kidding um
one minute into each floor he spawns the
devil or 30 seconds in
so any second now timing any second now
any second now holy
okay and then you can trap him with this
thing
and then you send him after your foes to
try to destroy them
however there is a catch
if you get hit by him you turn into the
lost
help me
so if you get hit by him you turn into
the lost hold the holy mantle
i.e like you don't get it um also if you
kill him
you uh it's like michael scott at an
italian restaurant
if you kill him he sends it back
oh this that's not the boss yeah it's
pretty dangerous i also like
i i had a great run as this character
earlier today
um and it all went to crap let me
explain okay
i had mom's knife which is
obviously like almost the closest thing
to a free win that you could ever
imagine
walk into an item room curse of the
blind whatever
some people choose not to pick those
items up some people choose to
live by the sword die by the sword i
think we know where i stand on that one
picked up the item
it was akuldama i said hey akodama
that seems pretty good uh
every shot that you create creates a
shot that trails behind you
so i was walking around i was kiting him
and i had all these shots
he walked into my shots enough that he
died it turned me into the lost and then
i walked into a mimic
can we get an f in chat please
like i was actually i became so strong
that i basically died is how i would
determine that okay
so here's what i'm thinking no alt path
yet
we'll do alt path next floor
by the way exciting announcement i think
dan and i will indeed be doing some
co-op again tomorrow
looking forward to it i i honestly think
we should do some like uh
i think the runs are going to be zany
enough
not smart i think we should try to
actually get some dubs we'll see though
because the the jacob and jacob and esau
and esau runs are
are very fun but also very frustrating
anyway so yeah you turn into the lost if
you get hit or if you killed uh
tainted jacob or tainted esau i don't
really like who cares okay let's not
worry about it
there's water under the bridge but uh
you you you're only the loss for a floor
so once you go down to the next floor
you're set it's interesting
it's an interesting idea there we
teleport every time we use our space bar
item
double tinted jacob
can you do tainted uh characters in
co-op
maybe you can only do them on runs where
you have uh you've already chosen a
tainted character to begin with
that's interesting i've never seen them
in the character wheel before that's
that's why i was skeptical
don't get me wrong it's a tough
character um
you gotta you gotta maintain a very high
degree of focus here
oh it's because dan hadn't unlocked them
yet so you could of course you couldn't
pick them that makes sense
genius i mean dude the character is
really strong just you know they come
with an obvious negative which is
it's like insanely annoying to have to
constantly dodge
but if you if you ignore that aspect of
it like
they really are quite powerful yeah once
you get into the flow
look at this i mean i think we're doing
a a good job right now
like might just be wise to like always
lock
down at the start hello
you can indeed have the burpee cloth
everything okay out there
oh good okay
there you go
okay i think just like starting every
room with the
anima han solo we should be okay here
like this yeah yeah and then when the
end when you're ready for an enemy to
die
you uh just missed completely
come on you should have taken a hit
there okay this is just
prepare to take damage like
he's a genius he's the smartest gamer
when i told my friends i wanted to be a
professional gamer they all laughed at
me
well nobody's laughing now
um dude we take it we absolutely take
those
hey hey hey hey get me out of here get
me out of here
okay forget the curse room and forget
everything you thought you knew about
curse rooms
i didn't get hit thank you
library could be pretty sick this run
could work i don't know what i'm doing
with it
but this run could work man um
so we'll take satanic bible which i
still think is very good
and now i'm like i'm running it through
in my head i think we had this before
okay
so let me let me think about this but we
can
get hit by curse jacob
turn into the lost after doing
everything else
too much going on in my brain there
after doing everything else on the floor
and thus take the deal with the devil
for free
but we got to make sure we're done with
the floor because if we get hit once we
just die
also like i can't believe i'm going to
do this like bro could you just take
like a little time off
because it's it's so good
that's incredible man on the on the
first plate
localized entirely within your kitchen
it's kind of unbelievable like i don't i
i can't really follow everything that's
happening on the screen right now
but it's it's going pretty well man
don't kick my bomb please i need to get
this spirit hard
yeah yeah yeah yeah
it could have been worse it could have
been a lot worse
i mean okay okay now just chill yes yes
yes
yes i would yes please okay hit me
please
oof no i'm the lost now okay just
kidding
um don't touch me please and i'm going
down to the alt floor because this is
the greatest run i've ever had
hey tomo how you doing buddy
okay now unfortunately the item doesn't
do much for us but still
it's still pretty great
i'm always complaining about how easy it
is to remember everything that you're
supposed to do in this game so like i
think adding one extra wrinkle is
is not really going to be a problem at
all
no more esau oh he spawns uh 30 seconds
in
don't worry there he is see saved
off-screen admin he's doing it
off-screen
okay i'll take a tears upgrade plus uh i
thought they gave us some spirit hearts
i
turns out i don't know what i'm talking
about what's empty vessel strategy
um i mean i guess the empty vessel
strategy is if we could get like a
guppy's paw or like an abaddon
we would then have the ability to fly in
some invincibility
i'll just level with you like there may
be options is not happening here
but definitely stopwatch has a real
percentage chance
to help us out but uh
certainly not uh there may be options
it's just it's too much cognitive load
man
i don't know where our enemy is
saved saved saved saved okay go ahead go
ahead
go ahead go ahead
just be careful you really don't want to
become the loss right here
we out here all right now we need bombs
to leave this floor that's fine
go to the mirror room chad says there's
a tinted rock you blow up the tinted
rock i don't want to blow you up
you did that to yourself
dude i don't know what to tell you like
if you're getting the anxiety from this
run
like the uh the average
tainted jacob run is so much worse
like this is actually downright merciful
right now
there is a lot on the go
[Laughter]
it's definitely a lot to remember and
it's easy to forget especially when we
got you know key pieces to grab and
stuff like that as well but
the average tinted jacob enjoyer exactly
exactly oh that would have been pretty
nasty
i'm gonna settle for nothing remember if
you got to get hit
get hit by an enemy don't get hit by
tinted jacob
although it would make it a little
easier to pass through the wall like jon
snow
i'd rather not have to worry about it if
possible
i don't know where you are what have i
done
you didn't even you didn't even pop out
enemies with knockback are like it's our
mortal enemy
saved saved saved
okay whatever you hit me congrats it
doesn't make you cool
and it's not going to bring back your
gosh darn honey
freeze them i i literally just in my
brain i just forgot how to fight this
boss
i just said i don't know what to do lord
i don't know what to do
okay so this one is gonna be slightly
controversial okay
um
i think i'm actually gonna pay for the
deal
and just take little brim even though
it's not that good
because i don't want to become the lost
yet because
becoming the lost from
tinted esau means you don't
get
holy mantle whereas you get to be the
lost with holy mantle
if you touch the white fire instead
otherwise we would we would have been
one hit away from our demise
that's true we could have just waited
till later that's that's a very good
point
well in that case the reason i did it
was to
not have to worry about empty vessel
because now empty vessels getting closer
to being worthwhile
you think you think you're so freaking
smart
hey hey okay
i think the smart play you just grab
this
that's fine we're gonna live and then
you get the heck out of town
if you'll excuse me
she'll excuse me if you'll excuse me
just moving just moving on if you'll
excuse me
i will just be moving on if you excuse
me here
just sneak right by yeah and uh place
two bombs down
place another bomb down yahoo
there we go
[Laughter]
slightly saved okay we got a little time
i'm just going to scooch right by you
we have an emperor card i have no desire
to use it just yet
i if we used it we wouldn't get a deal
with the devil and a deal with the devil
is basically like a potential deal with
the devil plus empty vessel alongside of
it right now
do you have enough damage for this floor
hey like honestly
the beauty about uh tainted azazel is
that even if you don't have enough
damage
you got enough damage because you got
this son of a gun right here
what did i say i meant esau
you know what i mean most of language is
inferred okay
incredible it's it's something it's
something
we don't we don't care for that
there you go just i i think i'm starting
to puzzle it together
don't wait for the right moment to use
um
han solo well don't shoot him if you can
avoid it
the right moment to use han solo is uh
is as soon as you enter the room uh do
you see the size of those things man
it's the largest rock i've ever seen
and i've i've played a quest for uluru
in high school music class
get me out of here okay um we we care we
care
might as well what the heck is uluru
um maybe you know it as ayers rock
beautiful
okay are we safe here i just i'm
thinking about i'm thinking about the
rest of this floor because once
we possibly want to become the lost
to pick up the item there's a chance we
do there's a chance we don't
i think we buy a key and leave just
don't get hit
in advance of the boss fight oh my god
let me out okay okay just fight the boss
this is don't get hit
by
tinterisa you can get hit by the boss
in fact several times and you'll be
totally fine
you just don't want to get hit by tinted
esau
and perhaps also importantly you don't
want to
cause tinted esau to die that was that
was bad damage
and we didn't okay now that was worse
but you know what look at that now we
got a heart just chilling
tactical
the damage is a little miserable
good shot
that's bad that that could have that was
twisted up man
beautiful they why kill the boss when
the boss will do it for you mate
freeze them send them
it's not very much damage dude
why cook bosses when the this will do it
for you might
okay okay we actually i think we prefer
to pick up
and then it is a guppy item i'm gonna
say hit me
grab get the heck out of town
all right hp is a little
up and down
but that's okay okay i've got a i've got
an actually beautiful idea here
by the way in case you're curious run
still kinda sucks
until um we get uh
esau chasing us at least however
oh he's popping out dude i can't stand
here this is this is deadly
no i was gonna say we're gonna use our
um
we're gonna we're gonna use our emperor
card but it's not the right time
it's not the right time now if we could
have done it fast enough it could have
worked but
yeah i'm a little nervous about
having to get knife piece number two
but uh you know
maybe they'll just be perfectly in sync
with one another maybe
you know
[Laughter]
does he follow you there
let me put it this way i got no reason
to believe that he wouldn't
all right um this basically sucks
killing him does damage like everything
in the room
but it also turns you into the lost
which is
really bad for the minds so like
i'm gonna stick to the same principle
for the time being because it's actually
like it's worked but i'm pretty sure we
are gonna kill him
accidentally i would very much bet that
we're gonna kill him accidentally
really if you kill him and you don't get
hit by the blast it doesn't turn you
into the lost
i've never seen it not turn me into the
lost
so i feel like i'm being trolled right
now
there's no way you can escape the blast
okay that's good intel i appreciate it
thank you
okay okay this is gonna be a little
spicy but don't forget
you got your own bombs that you can use
here
derek you very cute
very cute i'm so unbelievably mind
flooded but we made it
okay i mean we don't i mean okay you
know what this gives us empty vessels so
we just pick it up
and there's bookworm as well is that we
got a of babylon so that i'll
never
apologize for that then
i do have to give you two hp but just
just give me a minute here
just give me a minute neither of those
are worthwhile which is awesome we're
free we're free we don't have to go that
way
okay now we go back to get the key piece
there is only one way of not turning
into the lost which is to use the meat
cleaver and split him into two
i had i had no idea
what the heck happened to my camera
what's happening to my camera
get hit by him before the chase so you
can fly i mean it's a really
acceptable idea if you 100
firmly believe you're not gonna waste or
render the last
like half hour a waste by getting hit a
single time
but i i would rather take my chances i
think
i knew we were gonna get tagged there
too okay
quick item room um we take uh
dude that might be conjoined i'm willing
to take this to maybe get conjoined okay
um grab the money we might need to buy
some spirit hearts
anytime we see a key in a golden chest
we're pretty happy
we definitely like to press the button
very nice very good very swag i like it
dude he's like one hit away from dying
i'm so scared
okay um i have no idea what birthright
does
but you as this is the simple rule of
gaming you absolutely have to take it
when you see it
it does nothing no come it does nothing
yet
is this character what your your content
is coming later
a crummy commercial what it
unimplemented yet
rude dude if he dies like just don't die
on this room
please okay tower card we care not get
me out of here
it says unknown on platinum god
presently unimplemented
derek
okay please don't chase me
i appear to not be chased
open the door first i'm definitely being
chased by the way
um open the door first or i might cry
that's a good point because like if we
get hit at all
and we become the lost then the door
will kill us
that would be pretty disappointing also
we don't have
the han solo item anymore how about that
no the lost enters for free oh never
mind then
[Laughter]
easy the ultimate can of corn
run dude run
we got hit we got hit by mom though
we we killed him and became the lost
okay um
maybe maybe decent actually
maybe saved we're still i
yeah we're still the lost okay because
we don't have any a health bar
uh hold on hold on there's plays to be
made just don't walk in the fires
accidentally
he doesn't come back after 30 seconds
right like
that that would be a that'd be a little
devastating this is the whole reason i
wanted to do this
and then he go he goes in for free i was
told he goes in for free
i'll be highly disappointed
if this kills me not killed okay look at
that
can of corn baby
can of corn all right and we actually
got like a damage upgrade for the
for the first time okay
brain is expanding as we speak
certainly this run has a long way to go
still um
but you know satanic bible is real good
any hp very useful as well definitely
the best uh
tainted esau run i've ever had
like by a huge margin hello
keep it moving just keep it moving keep
it moving that's amazing
just be dead what the heck
thank you
i think we i think we turned a profit
bro bro pop up
there's there's too much happening 32
bombs thank you
invincibility from the freaking uh empty
vessel dude that's incredible
okay try not to shoot try not to shoot
the the the ghost you're doing great
just try not to shoot the ghost
uh no we will not take bomber boy it's
it's a little too spicy
instead will take forever alone which is
you know
it is what it is let's put it
what the heck happened
a spiked rock a spiked rock
killed the ghost
sorry we got the stapler okay now all we
got to do is beat the boss on the
mausoleum without taking any damage
it's so easy
spike rocks kill him is really annoying
uh i would i would agree with your
assessment excuse me
i thought that was a little brim
chilling in here
don't forget you can use ana masola on
regular enemies as well when prudent
i'm just scared like i'm just scared of
this enemies that create stuff when they
die
are real nasty
we gotta try
don't take my familiars possibly the
worst boss we could be fighting right
now
okay what are you taking
it's fully charged man
it's fully charged what am i supposed to
do
at least she didn't take my knife what
the
hell help me
we got a little brim sneak it in there
let's go
saved saved um
use it
because we're the lost we could only
take one honestly give me succubus it's
a nice little passive damage dealer
i don't know man too spooky sure we're
taking it we don't need to do anything
else on this floor
um yes we're good we have the knife
already you're good just go down
just go down saved saved saved saved
saved saved saved
saved save saved
okay just keep flying you know
that's right you're not wrong sucky bus
is definitely gonna hurt uh
our ghost but like i think that incubus
also would have like hurt the crap out
of the ghost
i'm trapped
they're they're both they're both tough
to avoid i think
okay that's good stuff
dude and we can leave we can just leave
we can simply vanish from this floor
stay low stay low
don't don't kill him not yet don't kill
him don't kill him
we're invincible okay uh we take the
it doesn't matter just give me the
negative i suppose
good damage okay
right it does matter i was thinking if i
got hit i'd become the lost but it's
only if i get hit
by the ghost still a damage up i'm not
i'm not turning up my nose
because i got a problem with its baggy
clothes
say no no he's he's fine he's with me
he's with me
okay okay okay okay okay holy birch i
think
you guys speak for the rest of the
audience when i say holy birch
i don't think we're gonna beat the final
boss i i think there's a chance and i'm
not trying to sandbag
but i i don't think we're going to
um but
suppose at this point like stranger
things have happened maybe
oh we're invincible you love to see it
hey
we like it's not just about not getting
hit and turned into into the lost
it's definitely about like our raw hp as
well
and we do have a great deal with the
devil chance here it's
it's so tempting like i really want to
know what the rune is
it's a was i mean
it's this is tough man
obviously we could leave but
i really we could always just use that
to leave
if we become the lost that's my thought
right now
i think we stay and try to get this free
deal with the devil instead
yeah i think we stay and try to get the
the boss item in the devil deal
and if he blows up we just send it back
if he blows up we send him back if you
put the salad on the top i send it back
come on a single enemy dude oh plus
we're farming up uh we're farming up
more hearts here
we're harming up more farts as well
cracked crown
okay yeah yeah it's a very nice damage
dealer
we're still going man
i don't see a good reason to leave yet
they haven't made me a compelling reason
to leave
okay quick what what does sigil of
baphomet
actually do
[Laughter]
it's the best trinket
it's a shield when you kill enemies that
is pretty good
we kind of already have empty vessel but
that's that's one you hate to get that
choice because that choice could make it
a huge difference for sure that's a
scary one
okay so this is the most deadly part
right here
if we get hit and turn into the lost
or if or if the the ghost dies and turns
into the lost
we got real problems that's that doesn't
bother me in the slightest
that bothers me a ton
[Laughter]
oh no no no no no
we're still alive though
okay just derek derek you
don't forget uh don't forget uh get the
family jewels
it's just waiting for ana masola to be
ready
i think it it proct like as i was in the
middle of the business
that hurts though but dude good stuff on
the post-it note for sure



slash marker grape tainted
jacob run all right
yeah i think like the way i understand
what happened there
we got sucked in by the boss it sucked
to the ghost
and me together which meant i touched
the ghost which meant i turned into the
lost
it's kind of you know is it bs a little
bit
[Laughter]
i got one thing on the posted note what
the would it be mom
oh it was mausoleum mom so it doesn't
count
okay let's let's unlock um
let's unlock tainted apollyon
i haven't heard anybody talk about them
but let's give it a try
it's very cool how about that it's sauce
sauce porcine
you got to be here earlier in the stream
to understand it
karma police arrest this man he talks in
maths
napoleon always start with two hp
probably i don't know dude there's so
many new characters and mechanics in the
game like i i
can't trust my old memories feels nice
to not be chased for the whole run
though
that's uh you know that's that's helping
my brain out here
herminka's hairdo is making me feel ill
it's like marge simpson's
pompadour
no more chasing time to banter yeah but
oh frick
people keep asking me about soccer man i
got no opinions about soccer
the beautiful game
i got nothing
your opinion on meet the [__]
actually okay first
egg of nog thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
tis the season to be jolly
thank you um meet the parents
decent movie
some humor there uh meet the fockers
planetarium meet the [__]
bad movie nobody's gonna take too much
of an issue with that i think
but meet the [__] i think it was the
first movie i ever saw
that had truth serum in it robert de
niro you know xcia
injects um stiller his son-in-law with
truth serum to figure out i forget like
if he's working with a foreign
government or something like that
um and he starts
he starts telling the truth he says they
say if you want to know
what someone will look like when they
get older look at their mother
while i'm a looking and i'm a liking
and i remember they you know they get
great hijinks you know as a result of
this
um come on man you got to give me a key
however
it got me thinking like is truth serum a
real thing
like it doesn't it can't be right like a
mechanism that causes you
to be forced to tell the truth when you
answer a question
alcohol alcohol is not truth serum
people that are you know drunk are like
some of the biggest
liars of all time excuse me sir have you
had anything to drink tonight
no
vsauce tested okay but how what happened
just because they tested it like what
what was the result of the test
they died rip rip vsauce
you know what at least they died doing
what they loved
science
man they're really gonna make me work
for this key huh
yoink
well the secret room is easy enough
the secret room is easy enough it's
right here
toldja money
not funny dude this is i'm a little
upset honestly
such a low percentage chance to get a
planetarium on the first floor and then
uh
no key to open it with that's like it's
just rude man
it's just rude
kind of funny though you can get it on
the way back up
yo
you're absolutely right open it on the
return path
does it stay around i don't know let's
hope so
anyway i just i don't know if i believe
in it
like i you know here's why it doesn't
pass the smell test for me
the the sodium penetal stuff
why would torture exist
if you could just like hit him with the
little syringe of sodium penetal and
then like get all the information you
ever needed
right you wouldn't you know resort to
breaking a dude's kneecaps or like
setting up the waterboard table or
something like that
if you could just be like yoink where's
the you know where's the bomb
it doesn't work like that oh i'm sorry i
didn't realize we had jack ryan in chat
okay
if if it wouldn't violate your security
clearance instead of just
telling me how it doesn't work maybe you
could type the mechanism by which it
actually works
oh that's that's for me to know you to
find out
at rotc they told us not to share this
information with anybody else under
punishment of getting an atomic wedgie
okay mom's pearl pretty good we don't go
there yet
you know a bomb would give us an hp
upgrade there's a lot of good stuff
going on here
it makes it harder for your brain to
come up with lies
you know i mean i'm not calling vsauce
into question here
if vsauce did it and that's the effect
that they experienced then uh
you know i'm willing to put my doubts
aside there's a
this is like a a coulda versus shoulda
situation
we could buy both and then suck them
both up
but then we'd have two useless items
that were sucked up
i'm not sure that's worth that much
rather have a tinted rock i think than
an eternal heart here okay
um
they're not that bad they're not that
good either
if we buy the sack the sack will have a
key we use the key to get into the item
room
we suck up uh polyphemus because it's
uh trash
told you there was a key true sure i'll
believe it when i see it get believe it
or not you son of a [__] you're still
gonna burn
that's uh what's the guy's name from the
matrix
i told you we're sucking it up man
it's the one that that's tank right
always it is is it one of those like
mafia nicknames where he's called tank
because he's like actually kind of tiny
like don't get me wrong he's built but
then like his brother's called dozer
dozer is like six foot five 260.
tank was like you know five five and a
don't get me wrong like a lean
130 like he'd still you know
he'd catch me off guard with his hand
speed in the ring i'm just saying
i will i will
i'm glad i did okay if there's a battery
charge
maybe we'll suck them both up i don't
know i don't know man
these don't take eternal hearts anymore
so there's there's some plays to be done
here maybe
luck is at one doesn't affect this but
you have a battery on the floor you know
why you're absolutely right
you're absolutely right i didn't know
tank was was tommy chong's son
it's incredible intel you know that's it
out here if for anybody that doesn't
know
and you're gonna be like everybody knows
this but i guarantee
not everybody knows this um
the guy who plays john walker in the
falcon in the winter soldier
is kurt russell's son he's been around
for a few years he's been in a variety
of different media
projects including an episode of black
mirror
but a lot of people don't know that it's
uh that is kurt russell's son
what see i told you
which black mirror was he in it was
called play test
please i just need the key it was the
one where
he'd test the oculus rift and it makes
his brain go bad
what if vr was spooky
please man come on come on
what if me mum was a was an oculus rift
yes he is he's in overlord as well
that's a good movie it's a fun movie
honestly
who cares i'm not sucking that up
i'm sucking this up man
don't shoot stop shooting one shot
landed
that's we're probably fine right we can
still run away
yeah okay cool let's just keep rolling
in
both of the russells are in the mcu it's
true you just need carrie russell
she can play felicity
see you later okay this hp
obviously uh obviously
i think you know it's a meme
why am i looking at it i'm like it sucks
these both kind of
i have the occult is not a good item but
on the other hand i want to take it
because it'll be funny
which means we'll leave dark bum we'll
suck
up plum flute grab this
it's a great item i don't know i'm kind
of of the opinion that it's
uh poopy doopy
and the the rest of planet earth just
hasn't come around to it yet
amazing say it one more time i dare you
don't forget mark russello oh yeah mark
russello
one of my favorite actors he's already
in the he's already in the marvel
cinematic universe via um
the incredible hulk obviously
okay moving on yeah yeah i don't know
what we're doing right we gotta we gotta
leave a trinket behind
leave it on the next floor
what about jack russell terriers dude
i'm going to be honest with you
i'm just like so good at some
types of trivia movies in particular
you know rand like world capital stuff
like that i'm pretty okay
i think if you put me up against the
average human being in a question of
like what type of dog is this
i bet i would perform one standard
deviation below average
i know chihuahuas i know
shiba inu
i feel i i know pugs and english
bulldogs
corgis wiener dog
german shepherd pitbull
rottweiler great dane
once we get into the collies and the the
retrievers
and the terriers i don't know i don't
know them
for a dollar name a dog flowers honestly
i'm probably worse of flowers than i am
at dogs
roses for sure venus fly traps
lilies um
tulips that might be it man
like if sometimes like you'll see
somebody and they'll be like oh look at
the lilacs and i'm like what the hell
are you talking about
how do you know that's a lilac like i
don't know what the hell a daffodil
looks like or like a daisy
i have no clue i actually have no idea
i'm not i'm not putting on a front here
sunflower i know what a sunflower looks
like
what did i suck up man i'm like i don't
remember anything
wait wait don't i have i have black hole
right
carnation there used to be a a
canadian oh and the end of the plum
flute you're right yeah
yeah um there used to be a a canadian
greeting card chain called carnation
cards
i feel like i could see their logo in my
head i would know what a carnation is
but i i bet like i i would underperform
the average
hugely in a flower or dog trivia contest
100
sporkl flower quiz
maybe one day i'll put it on the list
you see i'm using my steam wish list
again unfortunately like almost all the
games on it are not out yet with the
exception of like my summer car
dude we could use the battery and then
we could use our cool effects
and then also suck up whatever item we
get afterwards
could you guess a yorkshire terrier i'm
just like i'm confused about the
terriers okay
i don't think so is that the one that
looks um
i'm trying to think about how to
describe it yorkshire terrier it has
like um
yeah it has a mustache
it has it has thick eyebrows like it has
eugene levy eyebrows
is that correct
oh my god dude oh my god
i do no damage what what happened to my
damage
could you name a border collie i can but
only because of apollo i'm not even
being insincere
like
i'm not using the void i gotta save it
to suck up whatever garbage they try to
give me so i can turn it into shot speed
next floor we can use void on the boss
fight because we'll have battery by that
point
dalmatian i could name a dalmatian for
sure
101 out of 101 i could name a dalmatian
guaranteed dude i'm taking it we need it
what a horrible night to have a curse
you don't say dalmatian you guys say
dalmatian
in before um that's how it's said we in
in canada we i gotta ask malfon sips you
know i
there's another one that's probably the
first time i've ever said dalmatian on
stream
but in in canada nobody has ever called
me
out for saying dolmation
i'm in canada and we say dal
yeah probably because you're over in
freaking halifax
buddy you got dalhousie we're talking
about the rest of canada you know the
pardon that the people actually live in
i don't know if it's better for me if
you're from halifax or not from halifax
after
that both reflect poorly
no keys would you believe it
aren't you from nova scotia excuse me
take that back
i'm from eastern ontario hold on
we sucked up black hole
give me the key dude give me the key
give me the let's go
he's a genius he's a genius
galaxy brain
feel like it used too much of my charge
though
yeah like why did it use both charges
man
that hurts
it uses 1.17 charges what did the heck
where do you guys find this information
the heck are you talking oh i'm saying
it took that much oh okay so it took one
and a sixth all right
i understand
okay i gotta admit the tears are doing
some great work here
i'd excuse me i did not don't know while
apollo is well maybe i did is he here
i did see someone say nl apollo wishes
you well
and i i chose not to acknowledge it
because i was like
you know he can type it himself if he's
here
oh he's here hello hello apollo don't
know walt get down oh well
yo apollo you wanna play some siege
later
i'm just kidding there's no room left in
the lobby anyway
i know you're not even here
he's in vegas yeah you ever hear of
rainbow six vegas and rainbow six vegas
too
two of the hottest games for the xbox
360.
here's all i remember about rainbow six
vegas okay
in the first episode or the the first
mission in the campaign
you're in a helicopter and the greatest
innovation in gaming history
took place you could see your squad
on the helicopter and as they talked
into their xbox live microphones
their characters would lip sync like eat
your heart out uh
star citizen
they had that back in like 2007.
what it's true
chris roberts driving through downtown
i don't know where ubisoft is
headquartered somewhere in france
downtown marseille
begging for the location
of eve's guimot great range and luck
upgrade you love to see it
you love to see it
siege is from ubisoft montreal i knew i
liked that game for a reason
it's true the more tier effects we get
the more we're gonna be happy to have
luck although i'm not totally convinced
that like uh
you know two luck is gonna do it for us
but we got a ways to go
is it ubi i thought it was yubi it
doesn't matter like
you know most of the gaming arguments
happen
online where you don't have to worry
about pronunciation
or like you know making a good point and
then if you stutter people going
you stutter when he was trying to argue
like and you're supposed you're gonna
try to tell me to believe this guy
that's why the internet arguments are
are so much better so much more
productive
some fitter happier more productive
dude luck's getting out of control
you're not wrong
apollo i'm losing my mind by the way
why is it that every single tweet that
you make about anything
gets two and a half thousand likes now
and then sometimes also
i i look in the replies and they're
i'm not trying to put you on the spot
okay and i'm not trying to
make anybody in that particular fandom
annoyed either
but i was laughing like that there's uh
like apollo stan accounts like
they were and they're like they're
they're teenagers right i'm not making
fun of them
but i'm more making fun of apollo
[Laughter]
that like somebody replied to one of
your tweets and i looked at their
profile
and their profile was like five plus dog
twit
like twt and i was like this guy he's
got i didn't know he's got genuine
stains now
who would have thought he roasts them
daily you're good
okay well it's just funny
i probably blocked all my stands
sometimes somebody tweets me and they
have like
my face in their twitter avatar like
that's a mute
instantly i am not joking at all either
like that's i'm like you
you you're only with me until you're
against me is is
what i can tell from this yeah if you
got funky kong is your
as your avatar you're good to go
funky kong is not an nl stan anyway he's
uh he's a funky stan
he's a reply guy for sure but
not a stand two different things we love
the reply guys
i mean i'm a chip reply guy
anytime i see a chip tweet i already
have it pre-typed so true bestie
then in my profile favorited by chibly
april 14th 2021
i am a levy reply guy it's even worse
because he doesn't reply to my replies
i'm turning into swim fan
i'm hitting him with all these amazing
jokes he doesn't reply at
all
he's too busy trying to deflect all the
endless drama that happens in the chess
ecosystem
oh anyway
um yeah no it's good
kfc turkey is getting canceled because
they made fun of
poor people that can't afford food look
okay so much to dissect here okay
the phrase kfc turkey is just hilarious
to begin with
because kfc's chicken kentucky fried
chicken turkey
released the questionable statement
today then like i want to know what's
what's the nuance on this that uh
that led to because surely they didn't
just go like
hey be glad you're not broke so you can
buy our new like crispy chicken basket
or something right surely there was like
there was an ill-advised attempt at a
joke maybe
i was glancing
what the get out of here man
this is this is bad
starting to think i shouldn't have
sucked up the fallen item
stop glance okay glances have been
ceased
like a like a less discharge
saved i didn't even throw it dude
get him get him i need that spirit heart
dude okay we got to leave this trinket
behind as well
yeah thank you leave a trinket
tears upgrade very nice we say no to
those
don't move move
anyway i need to i need to see the
context on this okay
let me take a look we got time kfc
turkey tweet
just checking just okay okay
kfc turkey search for kfc
turkey i
i can't find the
i can't find the reason they were
canceled i think i've been baited
i think they've been doing a little
trolling
i think it's fake lore somebody in chat
just works for popeyes
you know it's possible it's possible
we've just been the victim of
corporate espionage
remember when burger king donated like
five bucks to streamers to get them to
say burger king
on stream
so good
i'm not even mad i think it's i mean it
didn't happen to me to begin with i just
think it's
extremely hilarious
if it happened to me i also would not
have been mad i would have
i would have just been uh
i mean you got to respect it in some way
it's guerrilla marketing
no i don't have the speed necessary to
escape man
on second thought under no circumstances
do you have to hand it to them
yeah hey man you're not supposed to use
oh check this out okay you ready
uh can we come on we gotta sneak it
through anyway the the joke was gonna be
hey you're not supposed to use
text-to-speech for free advertising
you're supposed to use it to
um say something that shouldn't be said
in public and then it gets played over
my phone's bluetooth speakers in uh
like a grocery store and freaks
everybody out for clips come on man
we try we try
um just chill we're just chilling
like the chill with you we're chilling
hope you like chilling too
sorry i was watching the simpsons this
weekend
let's go
it's a sign in turkish that says it's
free to look at
well you know i i don't know about the
context of it
that doesn't sound that bad
oh it's free to look at well i guess uh
all the calories i used to build my eyes
were just uh charity then
sorry that's my impression of you
jimmy john's has a sign that says free
smells dude i had a great idea so
like subway is really falling out of the
the public favor number of different
reasons one being the sandwiches don't
taste that good
um we out
two um the report that the chicken
wasn't actually chicken it was made more
of
uh it had the higher percentage of soy
in it by mass than anything else
um and then three just like changing
consumer tastes like the
increasing awareness that consumers have
that eating a food of bread for every
meal
is i'm just gonna get blown up okay is
actually not
healthy for you um i think that what
they should do
and i'm not a a business guy i'm just a
sandwich enthusiast
terrible just terrible um
i think what subway should do
is go the taco bell route
and just make absolutely disgusting
stoner drunk sandwiches
like in the same way that uh you know
they released
doritos tacos locos and stuff like that
just make like garbage and try to
carve out a space for yourself in an
environment where you no longer really
have a brand identity
like i want to see like chicken finger
sandwiches i want to see
i don't even know what it what about
like queso dip in a subway bag bowl like
give me give me some trash
man like just to get you a little
leverage in an increasingly competitive
marketplace
i believe i told you we'd get polyphemus
i did also tell you i'd suck it up
like do you know what subway's new thing
is and i can already tell this is going
to be a classic sort of bit get get your
um
get your clips ready subway you know
they've been suffering in the food
service marketplace for a long time
so they have to come out with new ideas
you know what their new idea is
i saw it on tv last night potato bun
sidekicks always struggle hey man people
don't want to eat potato chips is like a
side to their sandwich anymore
what should we do sell them smaller
sandwiches as an addition to the
sandwich that they already purchased
because after i eat a six inch sandwich
you know what i really want to do is eat
a tiny sandwich on a kaiser roll
it's just like like what i don't
understand like the marketing is like
hey for 250 you can add a potato bun
reuben sandwich and i'm like i'm already
eating
of the freaking foot of salami every
time i go into your store i don't want
more sandwiches man
i'm telling you if subway starts making
garbage you know what they got to start
selling
ice cream sandwiches they started
selling
italian ice cream sandwiches
then we'd be talking hey after your
sandwich go ahead grab an
italian ice cream sandwich
it's still worth it you know what no i'm
not sucking this up because i i'm
i'm i'm a mother effing handful okay
so get blasted
anyway i think subway is a real problem
i'm the only person i know who admits to
going there
and the only reason i even like it is
because of nostalgia
is which is a really weird reason to
like eat a food
beautiful
moving on yeah yeah because we're going
to yeah yeah or alt path
no no all path let's go let's go all
path
just for a bit just to see how it feels
double item rooms
why would you ever go to subway instead
of jimmy john's well like all we
got in canada is i mean all we got in
vancouver as far as sandwich chains go
is subways
there's yeah there's myriad subways
but very few alternatives you know
they've got the same benefit that like
you know tim hortons and starbucks
have it's always nicer to go to like a
bespoke coffee shop
i thought they were going to be enemies
spawning um but you know what's even
nicer than that
is uh hey on this corner there's both a
starbucks and a tim hortons so
you know how much time do you want to
take out of your day just to get the
moral superiority from from buying local
the music is sick down here you're not
wrong it's a double suck as far as i'm
concerned
i don't think i've ever i can't say that
for certain i was gonna say that i don't
think i've ever seen a mr sub in canada
at all
but uh i don't know if i can back that
up
it's been a long time though definitely
it's like it's not even close
there's a there's a company or a
restaurant called meat and bread that's
been expanding a lot they make
really really good sandwiches that are
like a maybe like one
dollar sign higher in the in the price
tier
um they're very good but they're not
everywhere
and being everywhere you know
that's that's a real competitive
advantage
no thank you can you name
two things meat and bread offers yes
every day
they have a um a porchetta sandwich
made with pork belly as well as the skin
of the pork
they usually also have a meatball
sandwich um and a buffalo chicken and
then they have a daily special as well
i don't know if you were trying to get
keep meat and bread you're like you've
never
eaten a meat and bread i eat there every
day and i've never seen you
it's good man i recommend it
you in new york new york um no if i was
in new york
i would get a
bacon egg and cheese salt and pepper
catcher may i want to roll
yes sir
you already know the vibe
it's such good music he's spitting
he's on x games mode okay we got to go a
little faster i don't want to be late
for rainbow six but i also don't want to
die
it's a tough question
we're moving
i agree that canada needs uh i i mean
just in general i would i would welcome
more fast food chains
i don't mind buying local either like we
we shop at a lot of local businesses but
like
you know there's some times where i
don't want to pay 15 and wait
like 17 minutes for my sandwich to come
out like
sometimes i'm like i just want to cram
like a log of
salted pork product into my mouth as
fast as humanly possible
oh like you're doing right now
i don't know what they are and we never
will
dude the range is getting out of control
here
do you think you could run a successful
fast casual
chain restaurant uh no
i do i mean i think i could learn but
like with my existing skill set no
i mean that's i i would have to be a
fool
to watch as much kitchen nightmares as
i've watched and be like all these
idiots
you know committed the sin of
overconfidence if only they were as
smart as i was then they wouldn't run
into that problem
i think it's you know you gotta have uh
you gotta learn
you gotta have a skill set you gotta
you know you i have no experience in the
realm whatsoever
there are some though where i'm like how
could you like screw it up right
[Laughter]
like for a while like starbucks seemed
like such a lock
it's like if you just you know buy a
starbucks like you're
you know out of control nothing could
stop you midnight
snack classic item for a dollar buy a
starbucks
buy a starbucks
could you run a franchise better than a
lot of people
i don't know man that's a tough question
it's i don't know if there's a right
answer to that this is
it's too it's too ambiguous
i'm sure i could run it better than a
lot of people
could i run it better than more people
who would run it better than me have you
ever had a dream that
you wanted him to franchise so bad you
could do anything
what the you almost took my bone heart
we don't need it we already left the
trinket behind i know i know you could
use cracked key to
you could use cracked key to do whatever
you could go into a red room yeah
go into a red room fight six enemies and
then uh get nothing
incredible i know half as many of you
twice as well as you deserve
he doesn't know i don't know man
derek you derek you
you know just call it a hunch
you can use it to get to the ultra
secret room
oh he doesn't know about ultra secret
rooms
yeah we're not gonna do all path anymore
we're gonna go
i'm just gonna go you know we're just
gonna go
how does that sound look at this it does
actually pretty good
because we're trying to unlock um
tainted
azazel now yeah yeah yeah okay and then
you come in this way look at this nice
little shortcut
that's new technology right there yo
apollo you still here
you should get one of those um while
you're in las vegas
you should get one of those drinks it's
really good
it's like they serve it in like a big
eiffel tower i don't know if you've seen
it
um everywhere
it's really good i don't know what it is
but it's in a cup that's shaped
like the eiffel tower
he said kfc you later
yeah it's it must be a french drink
it's the only explanation
otherwise why would they serve it in uh
in an eiffel tower
did you see that we flew on another
planet for the first time
i i saw some kind of tweet about like
their they they
built a helicopter on mars
i don't know what you know it's it's
amazing i suppose
i have absolutely no kind of context for
it
at all i didn't even know that was on
the radar
but it's pretty cool you know
because now like once we get to mars you
could do helicopter skiing
so like we've really come a long way i
think
and we can get the traffic report as
well they'd be like on the dark side of
mars there's uh
looks pretty much smooth sailing
all the like i mean that's
amazing don't get me wrong i'm playing
it up but this uh
that's amazing but all space stuff is
kind of amazing to me
like the hubble telescope makes no sense
to me
it just seems like a lot of work right
and they're like oh we just discovered
another planet and you're like oh did
you see it
no but you know light should have
behaved like this
but actually it was bent by .003
degrees so we know that a planet of this
mass
must actually be there oh but you got a
photo of it
no it's this is a digital reconstitution
of what we expect that it might look
like
based on uh its density which indicates
it's a composition of
73 zinc two percent
zirconium like it's just i i can't even
conceptualize like how you
how you do that it's i mean i'm not like
i'm not knocking it it's quite the
opposite it's incredible
come on work with me i took this red
heart for you
i took it for you let's go it sucks
[Laughter]
suck it up baby
dude our range is out of control we're
all we're hitting enemies that are down
on the womb already
we got to go faster we we're going to be
so late if we don't go faster starting
now
and yet here i go going slow again
team else hello daniel how you doing
thanks for the raid
i had a great time watching you play a
little isaac this morning hope you
enjoyed your tea melting
and other associated uh
enjoyabilities hey dan did you hear that
they uh had a help they built a
helicopter on mars
we were talking about all sorts of
sciency stuff here because we're a very
smart and erudite uh youtube channel
twitch channel
think i want it we got the hp why not
give it a try
don't even care about sucking it up
who's we human
beings of which i consider myself one
hello chibley we were just talking about
you
i was saying i'm one of your reply guys
but i am not a chib stand
which i think is true
dude i'm so lost on this run i'm like
are we
[Laughter]
are we gonna make it
yeah we dropped it trinket we're doing
great we're doing great i don't know why
i'm sweating it we're actually in a
completely fine spot
no because i feel like like stan is like
oh when i wake up in the morning like
the first thing i do i gotta check
chib's tweets whereas i'm a reply guy
which means like when i see chip's
tweets i always click the like button
and then like maybe leave like a little
i mean maybe type like yes sir
underneath it or something like that
and then every once in a while he he
danes uh
me worthy to receive a reply or
sometimes to receive a like as well
omg i'm a reply guy too i think it's
okay to be a reply guy
like here's the thing the reply guy took
a lot of heat in like the early 2010s
era of the internet
because it's kind of like a it was a bit
of a weird energy i guess
but i think you know we've realized that
there's actually like more
mutant strains that are way more
annoying than reply guy
i think people are now like hey you know
what as long as the reply guy doesn't
want anything from you like he's not
replying
in the hopes that like you know he's
gonna hit you with like a gofundme link
in six months or something like that
then you're like it's no harm no foul
no point no point in that
yeah i reply guy anthony fantano he
never replies i don't i don't do it to
be like maybe he'll collab i do it to be
like
hey melon review uh destroyers kaput
which he still apparently he did do it
but like i didn't see it so
what do i know
like 10 years ago yeah i was in around
his youtube channel back then or now but
like i'm listening to the album now this
would be very nice if you reviewed it
saved
now that i'm a twitch rivals champion
maybe he'll reply to me
you never know hey
okay i don't know this is too much man
my brain can't handle this
so here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna
diplopia
i'm gonna grab this and this
and this we're gonna pop down this
judgment
we're gonna play him and then we're
gonna suck up his item
yeah we're gonna avoid avoid i don't
know what's gonna happen but
this is the wrong void okay we're gonna
avoid this void instead
this will probably be fine i i can't see
how it could possibly go wrong
by the way i know a lot of people have
said that like we've slipped into like
the
the mirror dimension or like the evil
dimension you know as
as earth's uh course for the future of
mankind kind of goes
uh off course let's say a gentleman's
off course handy
i think i need to apologize like i've
been trying to
just deny this for a long time but
in 2004 in high school
i typed in one million
on my calculator and then hit divide
zero
uh and i think it's possible that
when i did that i'd maybe ripped a hole
in the fabric of space-time and
you know we we the the earth in reality
like folded in on itself until it hit a
foundational level paradox
and uh so i'm like this my bad and
everything
or whatever but like it's still pretty
cool
we still got cool stuff
a lot of new cheez-its have come out
since then
cheez-its
don't worry brother i forgive you nice
psych
what come on
are you responsible for extra toasty
dude they actually have
cheez-its in canada now if only they
could have released them when my
metabolism was still like you know good
nowadays i gotta stick to goldfish
crackers
my wife makes fun of me because she says
they're for kids
if they're for kids why aren't they in
the baby food aisle actually
like at the pharmacy they are but
it's very insulting that's why i don't
buy them at the pharmacy i buy them at
the grocery store
okay we got we got nine minutes that's
more than enough time man
it's more than enough time
yeah i don't know why people are so like
anti-goldfish man they're pretty good
they're also like not just for babies
like they're just a cheddar cheese
cracker i i don't understand why
people are like it's only a snack that
kids eat it's not
it's not and i think you should leave
bid it's like a it's a real bit
item room ah well nevertheless
[Laughter]
i guess they are shaped like something
which is a hallmark of a food that's for
children
but like you know cheez-its are shaped
like something as well they're shaped
like a square
what are you gonna do with this sierra
room uh go to a second secret room
find three spirit hearts on the ground
press q and then
actually have uh seven spirit hearts
where'd the other one come from oh it's
a typo
what the heck is that okay i don't know
what birthright does with the polygon
but we take it on everybody
we take those
like dunkaroos are for children it's
it's pure icing
it does nothing it's unimplemented
eddie eddie eddie
saved did you see dan as an emote of
edmond mcmillan's face
ed mundus that's so good
when your run goes back through time ed
mundus
this tp's you when you pick up money
that seems that seems kind of bad
it seems kind of dangerous i think we
should drop it
i'm dropping it just takes a second
everyone relax hey
you freaking jerk
i'm sure he got permission i'm not
sweating that
i was just surprised
it's jarring seeing your donation at
900 when dan has withdrawn 790 over his
past few streams
look you know there's a lesson to be
learned uh for dan
and he's it takes a long time like i
played the game for thousands of hours
and i still make mistakes right
but um at some point like on a run
enough is enough so just because you
like can
screw over your future self by ruining
your donation machine doesn't mean you
have to
dude i wish i was in the power lifting
twitch rivals because that would mean we
live in like an alternate universe where
like
kobe never happened and my gym never
shut down causing me to
slip deeper into the uh undignified
habit of capital investments
instead of physical fitness
i'm in the corner watching you kiss her
it was the calculator yeah ed edmundus
i think that's good enough to take
that's good stuff man
i don't even know what this item does
it's like every other shot is quad shot
or something
so embarrassing
more like capital gains yeah i suppose
there goes
there goes my bone heart that's this a
little embarrassing there there's some
embarrassment to be had
it's a familiar but it's attached to
your dome
dan said he could take you in boxing
earlier today do we have to have this
discussion like once a month
dan could definitely take me in boxing
time there's a youtuber boxing match
it's like who would win in a fight
they're like by the way i hate jake paul
i had everything he stands for
but if you stole his business model i
would definitely watch it
dan's in in much better shape right now
for sure it's not even close
like he's got he's got the jake paul
conditioning and i got the ben
askin
you know the only boxing i've been doing
is uh trying to get to the bottom of
this box of donuts
i will say though dan always
he always thinks i'm tall and i'm like
decidedly very average height but every
time i talk to him
about height he's always like you're six
foot right and i'm like
i'm 5 10 like if someone's feeling
generous
and he's like no you're six foot
and i'm like how tall are you because i
thought we were like the same
height but maybe
maybe you're like five six i don't know
he's always trying to gas up my height
is it's very
it's a strange energy because i'm i know
i'm not particularly tall
i'm just you know i'm just vibing
so smelly as boat thank you thank you
for the gifted subscriptions
i don't think it's because of the toe
walk i think people shorter than you
always think you're taller and people
taller than you always think you're
shorter
it's called napoleon's law
you have tall energy i don't know not
really i think
my squat was too impressive for me to be
tall
dude this guy i don't fear anything but
this guy scares me
um what happened to my trinket
you forgot it on one of the old floors
you can't leave it on all floors or it
does
oh my god man really are you kidding me
dude
it's all right our planetarium which
doesn't exist anymore
yes you can well then what happened to
it why are we talking about
hypotheticals
what actually happened
we didn't drop one on this one
[Laughter]
yeah that seems that seems fair
no kate is not taller than me
i am taller than kate the baby's taller
than both of us
it's all right i just gotta i've got a
sneaking suspicion
we're gonna make this work anyway
i still got one minute before i'm late
anyway no no we gotta look we gotta look
for a planetarium
maybe it's still here that would doesn't
make any sense at all
how could it be here
that wasn't this run either
no disagree that was this run
yeah that was this run man
yeah it was on the basement one
that was last are you you're crazy that
was this run
dude
i think i'm being gaslight here
okay basement one this is our last
chance
you don't have a planetarium item just
because i didn't have any keys to open
the door we went through the whole thing
there's no keys there's no keys on it
jerry there's no keys
we were keyless
that could still give it to us
no i can't
[Laughter]
telepills me telepills me telepills
telepills
tears down
well you know it is what it is
i don't even know what did we suck up
any space bar items apparently i'm
living like six runs in the past
we have 19 damage
i paid attention to absolutely nothing
on this run at all
we still might knock some stuff off the
posted that's worth something
okay we're not gonna knock anything off
the post-it actually
save save thank you spider
this is the run where you were talking
about subway okay thank you
i mean i stand by the idea that i think
for them to have a brand identity
they should honestly just double down on
making garbage sandwiches
i'd like to just make a poutine sandwich
or something
it's the kind of stuff that people will
be like i would never eat that but then
they'll definitely try it once
i mean even wendy's has a baconator
right like oh my god
uh i thought okay he was done he was
done there's still a chance here
just pop that yara rune at exactly the
right time
thank you for your help spider by the
way this move is not
so bad it's terrible
[Laughter]
all right all right i was like it just
needs to
i just need to get in the spokes all
right slash marker
cursed poly on



all right i know exactly what we're
gonna do here what we're gonna do is
press the
space bar go to file three
go to new run and then don't look at
that you didn't see that you know what i
want to do
actually bethany needs
hush and true ending those cannot happen
on the same run
that's okay though that's okay i'm just
thinking in my head
yo yoshikami thank you very much for the
the gifted subscriptions thank you this
one's for you
this one's for you hush and delirium can
happen on the same run
okay thank you okay hush and delirium
that's what we're gonna do
can of corn baby time the first mean
approximately half of one second
hush little baby don't say a word
proptos is gonna turn
all my enemies into thirds thirds
and if those turds don't give me
coins
something something something a diamond
ring
yo okay now we're talking all right
what's the dream
when you're bethany the i i'm not gonna
spoil anything for you but i had kind of
a dream run as bethany earlier today
that will eventually make it to youtube
um and by eventually i mean i'm pretty
sure it'll be up on wednesday
um the dream is cool and fun space bar
items especially space bar items with
the lowest charge
possible yo bethany's eyes looking like
me
uh during that two-day stay at the
hospital when we had our baby
there you go there you go look at this
tears up it's so easy okay we're not
going all path
on the alternative side though we could
go
alt path no hush delirium okay what do
we need for hush delirium
hush delirium equals just go fast
have we done boss rush as well
is bethany boss rush is the star
okay yes we have any space bar item
please
you know what i got a question for you
okay hold the front door um
we can't hold spirit hearts okay that's
horrendous never use that again i
apologize
um i have a question for you
what mnemonic did you use
as a as a school-age child to understand
and remember the order of the planets
for me it was my very eager mother just
served us nine pizzas
monday very early morning
hold on just think it got swept away you
don't need it anymore you just use the
internet i mean that's a good point
i can't be upset about that i suppose
i ever tell you how i remember um
the order of the tax in a taxonomic
delineations in biology donkey kong
plays cool or fun games sir
domain kingdom phylum
class order family genus species
that was not one that i uh i mean my
teacher did not teach me that one
i simply happened to uh i remember
11th grade biology i was just like hey
here's a mnemonic and the mnemonic
actually took
too well like it's stuck in my head so
well that i i can't get it out
i can barely remember what i had for
breakfast this morning or the boss that
i fought on the last floor
no i remember it was dingle
okay we can't lose our wisps man get
away from me i can't lose our wisps
because i can't uh use my space bar to
generate more we're like we're totally
useless right now until we can replace
okay this is good deal with the angel
always like a familiar um
take sworn protector we got conjoined
already which is kind of ridiculous
and then uh i think i'll just head down
to the next floor
no no advantages unfortunately
that's the fastest conjoint i've ever
seen
have you ever looked up the scientific
name for the pig
biggest mistake ever pig wikipedia
oh no one moment please they're really
called they're from the genus
sauce that's kind
of humorous
skull of a domestic pig sus
scrofa domesticus among us
okay you know what that's a good piece
of uh intelligence thank you
it's an easy one to remember as well
sus dude can i have like uh a bomb
and now did you get salty as a kid when
uh
pluto was demoted i'm pretty sure i was
like 18 when it happened
and i just kind of as a general rule i
leave that stuff for the uh
for the scientists you know that sort of
stuff is not really for me
i i trust the scientists uh
i will say it was like a huge day for
threadless
the graphic t-shirt store i'm sure that
they probably did
um they moved more volume of pluto's
still a planet to me t-shirts
it probably raised their revenue as a
company by like 25
which is incredible so more power to him
yeah i mean would you rather be the
smallest
real planet or the king of the dwarf
planets that's a good point
i mean the other thing is pluto doesn't
like have feelings
you know it's it's just like a a rock i
think
dude there's a lot threadless is like
that's from my generation i'm sorry to
say i know it's still around
the hamburger shirt is uh is from
threadless
that's a good one but like there's so
many i'm i'm thinking of that were like
just insanely popular like the one
that's communist party
and it just has like karl marx and and
stalin and lenin and they're like
getting
wasted and i think karl marx has like a
lamp shade on his head or something like
that
it was possibly like if you went to uh
a kegger in 2008 there were like nine
people wearing that shirt
okay at least we got our hp back
i have that poster yeah but before the
global financial crisis man things were
things were different
everybody was wearing threadless
okay we finally have bombs this run
could work i mean we're not we're not
going too slow that's for sure
i'm trying to think of what else there's
there's one that has like four
astronauts
oh you know what it is they're like
pac-man ghosts but they're like drawn as
if they're human
astronaut ghosts or something like that
um
trying to think of the the other
threadless shirts that were super
popular
can't remember
beats me you know him when you see him
though that's that's all i can say
okay well you know you ask for a bomb
you shall receive a bomb
or maybe many bombs three dog moon
ninjas versus pirates no question
i don't think i've seen the shirt that
was detroit in the shape of a gun
another shirt you would see a lot
sarcasm was was the language of the day
back then
um there was a shirt that just had uh
it had like a pennant on it like sports
merchandise
but all it said was uh go local sports
team
and or college that was another uh
very very popular kind of aesthetic back
in the
the mid 2000s to late 2000s i would say
d.a.e sports ball
okay i mean dark bum i i hate to say
this i feel like
you know what let's not even don't even
worry about the the negatives here
just think about the positive what's the
positive we got 22 spirit hearts burning
a hole in our pocket
eventually um when we choose to unleash
those like
we're going to be so strong
vote for pedro also very common
definitely also very common
i'm not buying it it's not worth it i'm
i'm freaking leaving
i'm freaking leaving
oh excuse me please take take take
thank you do you know the band the
ramones
um i i only found out about them 20 20
24 hours ago
i wanna go see santa
that's all i got dude i wish i had like
um
anecdotes but again is it kind of an
anecdotal existence right now
i'm just trying to steal myself like we
my vaccine date is not imminent
unfortunately however we do get
to register um in british columbia
this week
if you were born
prior to the year
like 1995 i think
which is crazy because i don't think
they should be vaccinating like
eight-year-olds that were born in 1995
but so be it
but just registering is just the start
um
then you've got to actually like they've
got to open it up so you can make your
appointment which probably won't happen
for like another month or so but
either way like there's let's go
either way they're still chunking
towards it at the very least you know
it'll just take time
um i'm just trying to like prepare
in my mind to be like uh
you know because i'm probably gonna get
vaccinated like a few days before my
wife
i'm trying to prepare for how to act
you know because it's gonna be hard for
her
to live in a house with like a superhero
who's been vaccinated when she hasn't
been able to be vaccinated for like
like if i get mine on a monday she
probably won't get hers till like
thursday afternoon and i'm gonna have to
be like
i really like to go to the movies right
now but i guess
i can't cuz you know so one of us isn't
vaccinated yet
because they happen to be born in the
1990s instead of the 1980s
excuse me
it's gonna be hard but i think i'll get
through it
uh excuse me i need i need those hearts
don't don't take that last heart i need
that heart please
thoughts on pop i can't get it
pop rock band imagine dragons
um i don't like imagine dragons which is
fine if you do
more power to you however
one of the songs that gets stuck in my
head with the
smallest amount of friction is uh
the lightning and the thunder i guess
even just somebody saying the word
thunder can
have me like singing that song in my
head for like uh
for for an hour learning in the thunder
the view of the lightning and the
thunder
i would i should have picked that up i
should have i should have picked that up
okay yeah that's good still got a fool
card
what are we doing here we're okay i'm
reminding myself we're doing hush
we're trying to do delirium as well
it'll be enough of a challenge just to
do either but
oh baby
how dare they tell me what to imagine
i think you know naming a band is pretty
hard
like it's kind of like a threadless
t-shirt right like are you you're either
just going for something nonsensical
that gets people going or you're trying
to go for like some kind of terrible pun
or something like that for a dollar name
a band
how do you feel about auto tune it's a
great question
um i don't care like at all is the
answer i guess
i kind of auto-tune is an aesthetic you
know
it was it was two i think that might
actually ruin our run there
it was too um prevalent for a while
in the 2000s and i can understand why
people got very annoyed with it
but just in general i'm not like i'm not
pro
auto tune i'm not anti auto tune
i don't really i just don't mind i guess
either way like
same thing like when when bands like lip
sync and
people consider it like a big deal like
you know of course they're lip-syncing
they're dancing you really expect them
to have like
you know perfect clear singing voices
while they're doing all those dance
moves it's like impossible
i don't think it can be done okay we're
still we're still going right we're just
we're having a good time here we're
taking the full card yeah we're taking
the fool card
i guess we're taking the full cut we're
taking the strength card and we're
getting out of here
don't dance just sing then yeah but like
if you go see like uh
like a pop group in concert like
i think you're kind of there half for
the the pageantry of it right like
you you really want lady gaga up on
stage singing
let's dance she's just like sitting on a
chair
spinning that record but no you like
you're kind of there for the
the roller coaster of it you want that
that's why
come on nobody that's saying yes has
ever gone to see a lady gaga concert so
like your answer is essentially
meaningless
i want to talk to the gaga heads
just hire dancers i mean like is that
what's stopping you from going to see
like these concerts i don't think so
what's going to stop you from going to
these concerts is it's not
you know norwegian black metal or 100
gecks if lady gaga just stood still
during her concert
you know it's not like you're gonna
start going
i don't think so at the very least
i mean you want to see what you want to
see in a concert right like when i go to
see
uh or if i go to see like a rock concert
i don't expect them to be uh
you know doing all sorts of like
gymnastics moves or anything like that
but
uh if i went to see like
uh i can't i i've skipped so many items
man we gotta try
if i went to see uh you know like bts in
concert and they just stood still and
didn't dance i would be like
you know this is not what i came for let
them
let them do what they're what they're
doing you know
i'm taking i don't regret that's pretty
good
i have no idea how to handle the
backpack here
so we're just gonna ignore it i mean if
i'm leveling with you
this uh this run kind of sucks
this run is like a little bad for sure
on the other hand
what if what if
look at that take hearts maybe i don't
know you like you want me to buy spirit
hearts that i can't even hold
we already have 44 of them like burning
a hole in our pocket here
this is regular uh bethany so i you know
what i gotta do i gotta get like the the
cobalt thing
i watched a little cobalt stream and i
was like this guy's got it all figured
out
most common question i get what
character are you
and uh what are you trying to do
and who is your daddy and what does he
do
it's very nice um it nips it in the bud
you know
we're regular bethany we're trying to do
hush which requires us to beat it lives
by 30 minutes and then also it opens up
a delirium portal and we're trying to
beat
the void and delirium as well odds of
this happening
it's tough to say like the run is kind
of bad
but it's it's got a chance we should
have fought
yeah because we haven't fought mega
satan yet 16 minutes necropolis one i'm
willing to give it a shot i don't know
if we had any bombs last time we fought
the angel statue
or last time we got an angel statue
cool shield now hey look at this blocked
okay let's take it up to 45 here um
yeah we're out i guess i mean we could
go back for the full card but that's
you know not really worth it no i don't
block people on twitter i just mute
but uh honestly i think i've i've hit
like the asymptote i haven't muted
anybody in
probably like a week
i think i've just hit the point where
like i've finally gotten
almost almost everyone
they're making people who are
antagonistic and overly familiar
much slower than i'm i'm purging them
from the view cone
is what i'm trying to say i think i
think we we finally
we flattened the curve there it's nice
it's good for the mental health
okay we have golden keys already let me
in
no no that's mine magician how is it
possible
like we have um
we have proptosis and we have 3.9 damage
like i don't know how this is plausible
i guess is it 3.9 at max range and when
i'm closer is not so bad like
i don't know promptosis was uh
was actually nerfed really i heard they
recently added less props
we can't take nine lives although on the
other hand we're only one item away from
becoming guppy
i can't i genuinely like that's a recipe
for certain death
um we'll we'll just chill for now
because we can get
out of the boss room on this floor and
then come up with the
then we can come up with a plan
afterwards we gotta find tinted skull
it's not dude don't even come on man
people are like anti-zane
anti-zane i see the way you guys play
isaac in your uh
in your free time oh the first uh room
was only a tears upgrade instead of an
all stats upgrade
uh hold r hold r
edmund hates fun he removed .01 damage
from the highest dealing damage item in
the game
anti-fun better cyber bullying
you gotta let people march to the beat
of their own drum in this game
okay now this that's a little anti-zane
i'll admit
i don't hold r i just lose absolutely
that's that's the spirit i can respect
that
hold on
take it your stats suck yeah but like
okay how does d8 work maybe it's time to
finally like learn something
um does the d8
shuffle your stats or does it like
independently reroll them
because if it if it's like it
anchors them to where they're close or
like shuffles them then we don't want
that because like none of our stats are
good
if it basically picked a number out of a
hat i would be way more interested in it
because this is
i mean like the best thing about this
run is fire mind and the second best
thing is conjoined like it's actually
this is pretty devastating
but all we need is that six point five
percent chance of a devil deal
or maybe like what about a a four
percent chance of a shop having
something useful in it instead of just
pure garbage
like buddy in a box not good um but i
suppose better than nothing and at least
we could donate
because this is depths too yeah all
right well
it re-rolls stance then adds multipliers
i gotta think about it okay i gotta
think about it
for now i'm happy that we were able to
at least uh
you know put some money in the donation
machine for the future because i'm not
sure this one is gonna
uh it's gonna make it too far
[Laughter]
i i actually i'm starting to get uh
suspicious that we're even gonna make it
out of um well okay here's the thing i'm
not thinking nine lives we're going
straight down so we don't care about the
tinted skull
we're just gonna fight we're gonna go
down to the next floor okay we're good
we're good
you know what we want right now
we want a a space bar
item i'm trying to think
of how it would work for us we do have
like so many charges stored up
man i mean like if we got like yum heart
i'm pretty sure we'd be almost
unkillable
just storing up all of our space bars
waiting for uh
waiting for the world to change
okay that's painful
let's take the negative no hold on
doesn't matter doesn't matter take the
negative
head down to the next floor and you're
doing great
yeah the negative versus the polaroid
i'm starting to lean towards the
negative in some situations
maybe even most situations now but we'll
see
because the way i understand it the the
i mean i know what the polaroid does the
negative
is that's is that our body in a box that
did that what the heck happened there
um
please the negative is a little damage
up
and then also when you get hit it does
the ah when you get
hit it does that effect okay that's what
it was
okay
maybe
anyway we're trying i mean this this run
is is pretty
horrible um we got keys for the
for the hush fight i mean i i would say
at this point like we're gonna make it
to the hush fight and then
probably lose after that
that's my expectation it's the same
damage up as the pentagram
dude that's like i've been underrating
it no question
especially you know because damage
upgrades are like
super uh
unreliable to be able to have one always
show up is pretty sick
it's just just insubordinate and
churlish if only you had more lives we
would definitely like i
i stand by the uh
i stand by our run now i said that when
we had three hp when this time we
actually have one and are about to die
for certain
but we would actually still die if we
had nine lives right now the only thing
is this way gives us a chance to win
whereas nine lives was a guaranteed
death
just back it up just back it up
okay this is a secret room
that's hp i'm choosing
who's gonna choose to leave but i didn't
i forgot the door closed behind me
fool okay
okay no no no no no jacob doesn't touch
it
now maggie's faith is probably better
magician fool magician fool give me
give me the magician we got six minutes
to get to that hush fight
okay i got ideas i got a whole game plan
here
there was a chest under the keeper
i mean i'm not gonna say no to money
that's that's free hush shop access
one run baby i mean if if we win this
run it's all right like
i'll give you the opportunity to
apologize
a lot of people wouldn't they would they
would just say i told you so
i don't like to say it but i told us so
yeah i think like you know we have to
accomplish oh my god
we have to accomplish something on this
run there's no point
in saving the flies
first for delirium if we make it the
hush which is
still likely but this is a freaking huge
floor um if we make it the hush we'll
drop like 50 papa flies like right in
his guts and then just see how it goes
i hate you you think you stink and i
hate you
are you excited for any games in the
upcoming year
it's a good question oh okay i don't
want to stand here anymore
um i'm trying to think not
really is the answer i guess all the
games that i'm excited for this is full
health so i'm not worried about it
um all the games that i'm looking for
for are actually like
like double a indie like pseudo garbage
that i'm i'm eager to play on stream i'm
not really interested in
in too much stuff that would be
classified as like
you just dropping fool cards man that
would be classified as like you know
triple a or like e3 type stuff and stuff
like that
like the new pokemon snap i probably
won't even play it honestly
i'll definitely play the new mario golf
though that's a given
help me what is wrong with you
look i know apollo's probably not live
right now so like you expect everybody
on the internet to share his opinion
about pokemon snap
i'm telling you as as a child i played a
lot of pokemon snap
even then i was like a little bored
you know one once you you figure out how
you get the butterfree to show up on
like the voltorb level
you know what else is there you're just
taking photos of cute animals that are
fake i got a lot of cute animals that
are real in my life
and we've all got cameras in our pockets
now plus i never really like respected
the way that uh
i lived um i never really respected the
way professor oak judged the photos
so he's like dude who are you to judge
photography you're like a
a professor of like botany or something
or zoology
you're not like uh i need this thank you
you're not a photographer you're not
angeris like
who died and made you the judge of of
photos i will say it was really cool
when i was a kid how like when pokemon
snap came out you could take your photos
to you take your your memory card to
blockbuster and then print out your
favorite photos
sure there's a lot of those sitting in
you know parents addicts now
i just don't see myself playing it
really mario golf though absolutely
dude please please just let me go to the
hush fight
just just to get to it and die on the
fight would be a certain degree of
nobility
i'm also just kind of like out of the
pokemon bubble do i need
that but we have to keep moving oh my
god oh man no no you don't get to take
those
okay we got we got about a hundred
seconds this room
and two boss fights i don't think we're
gonna make it man
i don't think we're gonna make it
okay firemind work with me here
it's like the one time an xl floor is
kind of bad
but yeah i'm just sort of like out of
pokemon you know i
you fool i played snap or not snap i
played a lot of pokemon go
and then like the weather got bad and i
stopped
um and i played the the not hey you
pikachu pokemon let's go pikachu because
i thought i was like in the pokemon
and then honestly i was just like kind
of bored
i'm not trying to rain on anybody's
parade i'm just giving you you know some
intel as to why i don't think it's uh
it's super my scene right now
but if you're excited for pokemon snap
then then more power to you i'm sure
you're gonna
you're gonna have a lot to play and a
lot to watch as well okay
mario golf though oh baby
i can't believe we did it i'm i'm not
gonna take any chances with this one
i'll go to the deal with the devil
please don't be krampus okay
do we care flying is like pretty good
but i think we need the hp
man i think we need the hp okay
so i'd give us a low percentage chance
of making this one through
but uh we're gonna try we're gonna try
definitely you do gift you leave the
room
if you don't leave the room i'll send it
back
belly button is not what we're looking
for dog tooth is better
[Laughter]
um okay
i don't remember the tomato makes
and okay that's extremely good i have no
idea what this is we literally just
unlocked it
i think tomatoes good it makes enemies
attack each other right
and then a tears upgrade is obviously
nice
range plus luck why not
socks speed up and your feet feel
stronger
i have no idea what that means
but that's so maybe we can stomp things
well you know what let's check
it's anti-creep oh that's really good
and then we'll take rotten tomato
and then we lose the wisp every time we
enter a new room okay
so i think we're looking for a card in
here if possible
okay nothing um i can't remember how
does moon card work
on uh blue floor
it just doesn't okay
fair enough and now
we press the space bar 57 times
oh man we got we got more we got a lot
more to go than i thought
yo this is sick man this is like doctor
strange fighting thanos
all right decent start now for the love
of god just don't hit q
space bar monday baby
and the flies aren't going anywhere i
mean because of boss armor like this is
pretty
it's still going to take a long time but
throw some bombs in there
donkey donkey donkey donkey
there you go you got trinity shield
get some thank you flies get some bombs
in there
what the fire mine dude um
i pressed the space bar and it created
70 flies
i think i've glitched it i'm for it but
i glitched it
i have some terrible news though i don't
think i can shoot because
the fire mine shots explode
i mean that's kind of the point i guess
but
just chill dude you got trinity shield
just chill let the flies do their dirty
work
no no no no no don't panic don't panic
don't panic there's where there's a will
there's a way man where there's a will
there's a way
frick that's a tough one
i mean we basically got no stats almost
ever
maybe the d8 was the play there a cursed
attempt



all right um you know we should probably
like
you know what i'm in the zone i was
gonna do some challenges but we're in
the zone
let's try to get some more like tainted
unlocks man and there's some characters
that are that are jones and
i i wanna i just love playing as tainted
forgotten
okay so what do you need is tainted
forgotten here's your seed by the way
millie twilly willy milly
you know you know dan's a little bit
there i'm not gonna steal it from him
um oh yeah also known as uh
cursed yetis dan's gonna love this
character
when he unlocks them there's no doubt
about that um
we i forgot it places the bomb where you
are but that's okay
we need to uh
do boss rush and hush ideally let's do
that
demon baby i there's no i can't i can't
not hit you
with demon baby i'm sorry
i wish it weren't the case but it is uh
by the way thank you cockatoo for the
gifted subs and farticus don't think i
i didn't see those earlier when i was in
the banter hole
i saw thank you farticus you won't get
away with it
hp not good
okay boss rush hush boss rush hush that
means we want to keep a move on
but we don't need to go so insanely fast
on floor one there's lots of potential
leverage here
boss rush hush well like i gotta hold on
what's um
so this is boss rush this is hush
what what are the other ones that you
need in order to find this stuff
in order to get everything unlocked on
the posted
there's four things right dark room and
chest
okay so you have to pretty much do the
whole the whole game
fair enough i'm not trying to rush it
down i'm glad that there's so much uh
so much meat on the bones here you know
dude low key you know one of the things
i'm excited about when
when we enter a post covered world
eventually
whole foods hot bar coming back
just a little expensive don't get me
wrong
but to be at the grocery store and be
like i don't know what we're going to do
for dinner and then just be like hey do
you want to like fill up a couple of
tubs with some buffet style food and go
home and eat it
it hits the spot man what do you want me
to say it hits the spot
very convenient but now they don't do it
at whole foods right now kazukovit
obviously but
i'm looking forward to it coming back
assuming it's coming back
we might live in a post buffet universe
you know i was gonna say we better not
but
to be honest with you i'm not all that
stressed out about the
buffet like i said it once i said it
before
we're russian we're russian that's what
we want to do i don't feel like the
buffet is all that
like there there have been some buffets
where i've been pleased
and like every once i feel like if you
go to like a
really high-end expensive buffet
it's nice otherwise there's a lot of
like
you know you're sacrificing quality
for variety or maybe even just volume
and you usually like you overpay
for the experience of a buffet in my in
my personal opinion
that's my take on it like i remember so
the first time i ever rode on the bc
ferry from vancouver to victoria
we paid like seven dollars extra and
that got us access to this like
i don't even know what it's called like
the executive lounge or something like
that
the executive lounge was basically just
a room where
you uh had somebody yell at people for
for being too loud which was actually
like
a pretty nice value and then secondarily
um they gave you free cheese and
crackers
now it wasn't like top end stuff but
still like i'm not
a little bit of black diamond cheddar
and some saltines i'm not against that
but everybody was like when we were
getting ready to go on the ferry
everybody's like as soon as you get on
i'm rushing to the buffet because i want
to make sure like i'm at the front of
the line for the buffet
and then um so the next time i was like
we got to go to the buffet everybody's
talking about the buffet like it's so
amazing apparently
we went to the buffet and i was like
this kind of sucks
like genuinely i would have rather just
eaten at the white spot which is like uh
like the fast food chain on the on the
on the ferry
yeah it's called white spot get over it
it's delicious
okay hold on i don't know i don't know
what to do here
so i'm gonna take both of them because i
am afraid of being called a coward so
let's do it um
and we're rushing we're but we've got a
little time we got a little time
i just like it i don't know like i've
been to good buffets
breakfast buffet at the paris hotel in
las vegas
when i was there for champions of fire
one i mean i feel like a breakfast
buffet is one of the best kinds of
buffets right it's maybe the only meal
that tends to be elevated in quality
by the buffet style you get fruit
you might have somebody running like
their own omelette bar or maybe like
there's a
like a hot waffle iron or something like
that like there's potential positives
there
but almost every other type of cuisine
i'm like
i don't know i i i bet there's good
indian buffets don't get me wrong but
most of the indian buffets i've been to
in my life have not held a candle to
what you would expect from that price of
indian food at a sit-down restaurant
like some
you get to sample a lot of different
things which is nice but i'm always like
ah
the the papadom is like weirdly kind of
chewy and like the
i don't know the non just doesn't have
the kind of
the je ne sais quoi i'm looking for i
guess
all you can eat brazilian steaks for
sure
no doubt about or brazilian steakhouses
i should say for sure
however definitely they can get a pretty
expensive as well but
that's what i i don't disagree
i feel like um the best
kind of buffet you can get is actually
like
is actually like an expensive buffet
like a cheap buffet you sacrifice
usually the quality of the food
for variety and volume but at an
expensive buffet it's like you're paying
through the nose but
you're kind of getting the best of both
worlds i guess
okay this is a cool synergy here
it's undone saved just
just like a single key just throwing out
there that like a single key would
really hit the spot right now
caffeine pill no thank you
we might get a planetarium on this floor
and don't get me wrong dude you know
you're absolutely right and i guess
maybe this is why they don't do it
anymore
the pizza hut lunch buffet was the dream
like for the price of half of a large
pizza
you can eat an infinite amount of pizza
the only downside that you get with that
is that sometimes they don't put out the
kind of pizza that you want
like when i go to the pizza hut lunch
buffet i would only want meat lovers but
you know they're putting out they're
like
hey another cheese we're putting we're
putting out a
okay and then like maybe every once in a
while they'll throw them a bone
they'll be like here comes the supreme
but you're like i don't
really like the pizza hug green peppers
i'm gonna wait it out like
i can't do that but in terms of you know
you get the average quality of pizza hut
plus the volume of you know all you can
eat
that's good stuff i love
pizza hut by the way and i know like i
have very bad fast food takes i also
enjoy
kentucky fried chicken from time to time
so i would not suggest like i'm in the
right on this one i'm merely suggesting
that uh
you know if you're ever driving by pizza
huts and you're like
you know i wonder why these still exist
i mean i haven't eaten at one in like 12
years but
if i made more dinner decisions i would
you'd be seeing even more of them
this popeye's a thing in vancouver um
popeyes is
not i don't think there is a popeyes in
vancouver but they're they're slowly
kind of spreading across canada
so i think that there's a uh there's a
chance they might be here soon the fried
chicken market here is weird there's a
lot of uh
there's a lot of kfc and then there's a
ton of
korean fried chicken restaurants
and then trying to think of what else
while jollibee is like starting to make
a presence here
i'm very annoyed by the way like i've
been going to bed for the jollibee
corporation
despite having never eaten there just
because i'm getting hyped up and like
we've been inside for 16 months so i
have like
you know i i gotta just find hobbies
like hyping up restaurants i've never
been to
um then i looked at their website and
jollibee canada
they've actually opened up a fried
chicken restaurant in saskatchewan
before they opened one up in in british
columbia
like do you just want to make no money
no offense to my saskatchewan viewers
but i mean like
come on the nerve we're going to ignore
like the tri-cities
not to mention i mean like vancouver
surrey burnaby
coquitlam new westminster and they're
like nah we're going to put one like
in the rio can center in you know north
battleford saskatchewan
like honestly i had to rethink whether
or not i even
like want to support a company like that
in the future but
you know we'll figure it out we'll
figure it out
one thing you should know about me is
i'm not scared of anything so let's just
take this and move on
that being said i'm a little nervous
that we're gonna die
which i guess was what we should have
been scared of in the first place
oh let's go okay now we're talking
if we get to a second secret room too
hematomisis could
could do a lot of work for us
look at the bowling balls on this guy yo
did you see jack black was trending
yesterday
love that guy man
i've never met him i just find him
humorous but
what was he trending for basically like
literally my the sentiment i just said
which was that uh
people like jack black something went
viral that had like
uh it was related to school of rock and
then everybody was like
you know oh jack black love that guy
i was like i don't disagree man
it was the saxophone clip oh man i love
the saxophone clip
i will say though like okay so
it was like a year ago it was over a
year ago okay
this is huge it does cost we don't need
not yet not yet not yet
um but there was like a viral
monster hunter tweet that was like
jack black playing the saxophone but it
was like
over cut with something on top of it
that was like you know the buffs that
you'd get from the hunting horn in
monster hunter
and i quote tweeted it and was like this
is the funniest thing i've ever seen
my only memory is like one dude getting
in my mentions like
so are you gonna give credit to like the
original maker of this and i was like
i i didn't steal it i just i
i just quote tweeted it you gotta get
but then like the original person that
made it i guess was not like a known
quantity or whatever
so that you couldn't go after them for
original credit so they had to go after
me for original credit instead even
though i didn't
steal it in the first place and i was
just like come on man it's like
that's that's not how the culture on
twitter works the person making the
original tweet is responsible for
for giving the credit now i'm i'm the
scapegoat just because i
uh just because i laughed at it
anyway that's that was like um that was
march
uh 2020. very quickly we found some real
things to be concerned about from that
point onwards so
you know it's kind of water under the
bridge but
it's your fault for not hiring a private
investigator to find the original
author that's the thing man we're gonna
need to get like um
meme historians we're gonna need to get
like ombudsman's pretty soon
as uh i see you've retweeted a meme from
person x
don't you know that seven years ago
person x was accused of uh
you know doing something nasty i i
really am surprised to see that you
would retweet
funny animal picture from person x
and i'm like oh my god man i just i just
thought it was a it was a dog
and then the dog looks like it has
eugene levy's eyebrows
is it just just sue me okay just just go
ahead give me a subpoena
if i'm going down i want to go down
laughing
get him there we go
okay we're definitely going to make it
the boss rush that item existing is an
insult so we'll just move on
it's an insult that that item exists
don't you know that dogs only have
eugene levy's eyebrows under extreme
duress
got him i don't know man like
this doesn't have to be like another
social media bit i'm sure like half
these people are trolling but
there was like uh you see the four
horsemen of the apocalypse viral tweet
and it was just dms from people that are
like um
i can't help but notice that your
twitter avatar is like
raymond my friend is uh
ships themselves with raymond from
animal crossing and it gives her a great
deal
of stress to see that he is in your
avatar because it makes him
it makes her think that he's cheating on
her so if you could please remove that
and issue an apology that would be great
and you know you're just like
you got to remind yourself you know a
could be trolling b
if they're not trolling they're probably
like 14 years old
and then that you know it's the thing is
on the internet
it's hard to tell you know you
unless people put like their age in
their bio or something like that you
just kind of assume everybody's like
your age
so i'm always like who's this 33 year
old bald guy tweeting me about this
you gotta care way less about this sort
of stuff
but then i'm like wait a minute there
are people on earth that were like born
after the year 2005. like i gotta
remember that
no twitter's been pretty good for me
lately i got nothing's wrong with with
my twitter lately
i will say there was a there was a tweet
that was like
someone was like should should i tell nl
i was the inspire
that i me personally was the inspiration
for them
starting streaming and then i was like
oh that's nice
and then i came back like half an hour
later
and there were like eight replies from
like two people having a conversation
not a mean conversation at all but just
like
what is this couscous and i was like
maybe i'll mute them
and then i thought no they said
something nice they're just you know
you didn't even get inconvenienced
you're just like you know it's too larry
david-esque i'm like ah two people are
talking
near me that being said
it is polite
to untag a person on twitter
if they're not you know if they're not a
part of the conversation to begin with
so i would appreciate it in the future
if you would do it
i don't know why i thought that would
work okay we're on dank depths one
more money please
yeah people i mean some of twitter's uh
features are like pretty um i don't know
what the word i'm looking for is
maybe like slightly obtuse like any time
i use a dot
at on a tweet people like
they a lot of people don't know what dot
adding is dot adding is when you want to
address a tweet to somebody but that you
also want
your followers to see it if you just add
them
only people that follow both of you will
see it if you dot at it'll show it to
all your followers
then people are like what are you doing
with this dot ad and i'm like
you mistyped there's a dot there
and i'm like you know you don't know
what you're talking about man okay hold
on
we can't do this we need hp we need hp
is that true yeah yeah that's the that's
the dot at man
like that's why i always i i dot at uh
brands
i mean you don't have to use a dot you
know you could use like a slash or
whatever but the etiquette is that you
like use a dot
that's that's you should always dot at
brands
because the dot ad is almost like a you
know
it's like a shot on the bow it's like
hey brand
all my followers are see we'll see this
like if i was gonna
do uh if i was gonna tweet hellofresh
you best believe there was gonna be a
dot in front of that
excuse me hellofresh why are we paying
uh
80 a week for six meals and then you're
also sending us
a bunch of junk mail from hakeem optical
i'm still cooking that one up in the in
the cooker
yeah that's that's how you gotta tweet
bubbly from now on as well
that's not a callback i'm still mad
about it
that's a call forward if anything
did you know okay someone in chat said
that's okay someone enchanted is because
they're worried you're not eating enough
carrots
i only found this out a little while ago
do you know that whole carrot uh giving
you better eyesight stuff is
like a myth from the second world war
i guess the british had like a surplus
of carrots or something like that and
they were like yeah you got to eat these
it makes your eyes better
and here we are like you know 80 years
later
going like eat your carrots oh no it was
a radar thing or so yeah i can't
remember anyway
long story short like it's a freaking
lie
you should still eat carrots so i'm sure
they're good for you they're also pretty
delicious but
okay yeah i understand now they were
like our our anti-aircraft gunners eat a
lot of carrots that's why they're able
to spot the warplanes
it wasn't just uh
it wasn't just radar yeah okay i
understand
okay
is there an eternal heart this is
eternal heart up there
nl do you like celery this isn't going
to be like how about you
you know celery and these nuts or
something right
i i i bet i like celery more than the
average person i know it's not a
competition but
if it were i think i would be in the
running
thank you sir
i i enjoy celery it's like
spicy water we don't we don't need
tinted skull don't worry about that
you don't don't you don't you worry
you're pretty tiger head we're gonna get
you home to tyson in your cozy
tiger bed then we're gonna find our best
friend
doug and then we're gonna give him a
best friend
hug
rat jam ratcham thank you thank you
that's from
the hangover if you weren't there then
you don't know but if you were there you
don't remember
no no
what are we at oh i miss boss rush
got me talking about twitter i miss boss
rush dude
it's all right we can still make hush
can of corn and i'll be all right girl
boss rush dude i can't make those jokes
i don't know what they mean
i don't have the necessary context to
protect myself
no we still gotta fight hush yeah yeah
it's a chip thing i can't just repeat
the chip tweets it's gonna get me in
trouble cause
i never delete tweets unless i spelled
something wrong and even then sometimes
i'm like i can't delete it because then
they'll know i'm owned
um chip deletes stuff all the time
like i i two days ago he tweeted
something like i'm gonna try something
new
i clicked the heart button on it opened
up my phone like an hour later it was
like this tweet is not available i was
like what tweet
it was that tweet
now i don't even know what he did i
don't even know what kind of new stuff
he tried
this is what we're looking for he
deleted the hamster tweet i was looking
for
i'm telling you man he's a serial
deleter
but i honestly think like that's the
dream
why would you ever leave a tweet up
after like it didn't perform
artificial scarcity exactly you gotta
you gonna be a
tier three subscriber to get a list of
archived tweets
i delete like 40 of my tweets i hear you
i mean
there's really no value in leaving them
up
unless if you got something that's done
such incredible numbers like
it'll get resurfaced years later maybe
but then like apart from that
i think there's like it's just a disease
in the human brain right like there's
sometimes where i'm like i should tweet
this
and then i tweeted and then like a day
later i look at the tweet and i'm like
why did i tweet that
but in the moment it was like a burning
desire it was like people have to
see this it'll be hilarious then i look
at it the next day and i'm like
it's not so funny it wasn't really that
funny in the first place
your mind plays tricks on you
yeah yeah yeah
yeah you know i don't know what people
did in like the 1800s i guess they just
sat around the dinner table
and they would like some dumb stuff
would pop in their head and then they'd
be like i gotta say it
and then they'd say it and then the day
later they'd be like why don't i say
something
so so fool hardy in front of veruca or
something like that
okay we're going to hush that's no
problem
this is already bad so i'm not sweating
it
and a day later they all died from
scurvy exactly
they wrote it in the newspaper you know
there's a there's a good punch line in
there somewhere
we have to take this like you got to
respect like when somebody
leaves an angry comment on something
they might actually just regret it like
a couple of hours later
but like back in the day you had to like
write a when you were angry you had to
write a letter
to the editor in your newspaper like you
had to get out like a piece of paper
and then a pen and write a bunch of
stuff down and like while you were
writing you had to maintain like the
state of mind
that prompted you to start writing the
letter in the first place and they're
like dear
sir or madam i hope this
letter finds you in good health
you know it's like i can't be angry
about anything for longer than one hour
it just it doesn't work yeah then you'd
like
lick the envelope and put a stamp on it
then you put it in your mailbox
it's probably a freaking saturday you
gotta wait until monday for the
the mail carrier to come up and pick it
up
you know there's got to be times where
uh
somebody has like written a letter to
the editor and then by the time like it
got printed in the newspaper they were
like i don't stand by those words
anymore
i'm a changed man
i remain as always you're an obedient
servant
money equals damage yeah so look at that
more money
more money less problems
all right it seems pretty solid
what's the most arcade service that's
still used all the time it's got to be
the postal service right
okay first off shut up like the postal
service is
actually sick let me know when the
internet invents a way
to transport matter from point a to
point b
you know like i i get like when you're
sending like a personal letter or
something like that you'd probably
rather send like a text or an email or
something like that
but that that service sends packages
all around the world
i i can put like two stamps on a package
in vancouver
address it to st john's newfoundland and
it'll be there in like three days
that's magic
but i i feel like the most antiquated
thing that we use
it's gotta be like i don't know i feel
like sewers are like
simultaneously like incredibly modern
but also like they work on
age-old principles or something like
that
facts machines i mean that's crazy to
think of if if fax machines are the
oldest
like i mean they were probably only
invented in like maybe the 60s or
something
toilets you know what could be toilets
yeah it always blows my mind when i
remember that the new york subway system
is like 130 years old or something
how the heck were they doing that stuff
back in uh
back in the early or the the late 1800s
man that's crazy
anyway dude i love the postal service
and i i like i'll be honest i'm probably
one of the only millennials
that likes the actual postal service
more than the bands with uh
ben gibbard and jimmy tambarello i love
the postal service
i still mail my my tax installments man
i don't know like it doesn't make
any sense i've said it before there was
like
and for anybody that you know is always
wondering the impetus of why i don't
just like
auto pay online there was one i i had
handled all my stuff with
electronic payments and and thought that
i was a genius
and then one year i got a letter in the
mail a very serious letter
from uh our tax service in canada
and it was like hey uh it's the end of
the year you owe us like a billion
dollars
and you just like you're the logic
section of your brain just shuts down
right
you're just like uh i don't even know
what the heck is going on
so it took until the like adrenaline
wore off and i started investigating
like the the books and stuff like that
and then i was like i'm pretty sure that
i
actually owe them the exact amount of
money
that um i sent them
so something about this doesn't seem
right and then i called them
and they were like oh yeah it seems like
you actually did pay
we just put it in like the wrong bucket
like we put it in next year's taxes
instead of like
we gotta go dark room man there's no
choice on this one we're gonna die
yeah i don't i don't know if it was my
bad or if it was their bad
but basically it was like
hey when you sent us like x amount of
dollars which is the exact amount that
we said you owed
we thought you wanted that to be like a
prepayment for next year instead of like
the money that you have to pay us this
year or you're gonna go to jail
and i was like that's not the case
believe it or not but i kind of feel
like that's
uh just accounting to begin with
you know if you if you put something in
you know column a and it doesn't look
good then you're like can i get away
with putting this in column b
and they're like oh yeah absolutely why
didn't you say so
then again i don't know anything about
accounting so
[Laughter]
what do i know
so that's why i mail my taxes every year
because then like i can
i i write and i'm sure you could do this
electronically
but it was like i i have like a little
trauma associated with it right like i
have like
like a little ptsd honestly and uh
so now on every check that i send in i
write
on the check you know this is like april
2021
fiscal year installment 4 of 12 or
whatever and then i'm like
if you put that in the wrong bucket
you're gonna you know you got some
splaining to do let's put it that way
no don't don't even i live in europe and
my government does taxes for me
i i just realized i'm kirk van houden i
write
my installments on my check in a big pen
is that what you do homer from belgium
oh my government does my taxes for me
all right
excuse a little extra spirit heart
counts every extra spirit heart counts
that's true i guess in north america
they do do your taxes for you
they just don't tell you the result and
then if you get it wrong by enough
then you uh might go to prison i think
is the
is the option there i think that's
overstated
but
i think the onus is on you to be like
actually irs you're wrong
they probably won't they won't throw you
in prison
they'll just be like give us all of your
money like forever
or you'll go to prison
[Laughter]
something like that
i don't know this again it's not my area
of expertise
i was laughing though because like i i
apologize to bear i don't think it's a
sensitive info at all
um but you know it's not my story to
tell but i'm gonna tell it anyway
um but i guess like bear from last year
he had like a nice tax
refund that he was supposed to get um
but then like obviously like you know
2020 happened and a lot of the wheels of
bureaucracy
bureaucracy sort of slowed down so he
like didn't
get his refund for a long long time
um and then like he got it
around the same time that he had to
start filing for 2021 and you're like
i mean i guess what are you gonna do you
can't really
uh be like uh actually i'm not gonna
like
pay this or whatever but
definitely is like okay i didn't know
you could do that you could just be like
ah
you know that refund that you're owed um
we're actually just not gonna give it to
you uh until you now owe
us so we'll be taking that back
dude we're gonna get some of those items
don't even worry about it
don't even work don't you don't even
worry about it
he's so slow
yeah darkroom gives devil deals now
which is actually like
awesome except in this one kind of
unique case
in cases where you're quite low on hp
it's not as good as getting seven troll
bombs in a single spear at heart
like things used to work
but it makes the path much more fun that
combined with the fact that the negative
gives you a nice uh
like damage bonus what the heck
is this a lab
how are you alive like just be honest
i'm i'm a little upset that you're the
strongest enemy that's ever existed
those guys have boss armor oh no anyway
i know nobody likes the finance talk i'm
just explaining
why i love the postal service and why
i'm also the only person under like 40
years of age that still like has a
checkbook
that's pretty much the end that's all i
got
like i said i i came to terms of the
fact that you know
the efficient market hypothesis is
probably largely correct and as a result
now i have no reason to
keep you know have having investing
being a hobby and i'm just kind of i'm
lost and i'm adrift
i'm going to have to get into another
hobby that's really annoying to hear
other people talk about like meal prep
or cryptocurrency or something like that
i don't know what's crossfit okay
there's always that would be beneficial
probably yeah
i don't i don't want to be here i've
decided i don't want to be here
i could get really into facebook that's
what a lot of people do
become one of those facebook guys
bro if we win this run it's like true
miracle hours
hey come here dummy
wait a minute does this even help
explain this to me how because the head
won't take damage but the only thing
that will do damage is demon baby right
i don't want to like let demon baby win
the run like that's so sad
ah you gotta do i guess you got to do
what you got to do
put it in cinematic mode remove the
score from the screen temporarily
wow we're actually just dead huh
what do you mean move
can move just don't shoot
oh i see i see
oh oh we almost got freed okay no no
here's how we do it okay
we just wait for the hush to push
the enemy out of here so that we don't
die
you can move as soon as i move i'm gonna
activate my hitbox i'm gonna get hit
you won't oh you're absolutely right
yeah okay
he's baiting there's no way there's
always the first time i've seen this
interaction on this character that just
entered the game
10 seconds ago i just i
i i sort of still don't understand this
is really good though i like that
it's a bug so as long as i never shoot i
can't be
i can't be killed
correct
okay as long as the bones stay still
now now my friends call me bones
all right well it's an easy win
you can still carry him too i guess you
know that makes sense you you could
carry him with
with akuldama or whatever this is called
that's exclusively a michigan commercial
utica heavens no it's an albany
expression
what's your opinion on the 2007 hit
movie
stardust starring claire danes believe
it or not i've
actually seen it
um i know it also has robert de niro in
it
i think it's a pretty good movie i i
believe
if i remember correctly i think i
enjoyed watching the movie
but it was a long time ago
let's chill out man
yeah i think michelle pfeiffer is in
that one am i crazy is nathan fillion in
that one
i feel like that's a nathan fillion
joint
henry cavill's in that i had no idea man
you had almost got me
what kind of drink is that oh i'm glad
you asked oh no
well worth it worth it uh it's a spark
mouth
it's spark mouth sweetie
the greatest sparkling water brand in
canada
we're just chilling
why the bubbly fallout i've said it
before i'll say it again and again i
don't think bubbly did anything wrong
it's just the nature of the business i
guess
um you know i i
surreptitiously slipped into bubbly's
mentions on twitter a few times i said
hey bubbly
loving the bubbly sometimes they hit me
with like a quote
tweet smiley face or a thumbs up or
something like that
um and i waited for perhaps some more
overtures to be made
in in an economic sense perhaps they
would slide into the dms and be like
what they would slide into the dms
perhaps and and
you know be like hey let's sponsor this
guy he seems like a good guy he's got a
great uh
following um
was waiting on a reply there
to which one was never received hank
greene
made a tweet how do i stop drinking soda
17 nano seconds later they replied to
his tweet
and said hey can you follow us we need
to dm you real quick we got a great idea
and uh that was it
for me that was it that was when i said
you know what
why am i giving free advertising to this
brand that doesn't know i exist just
because i didn't write the fault in our
stars or teach a bunch of sixth graders
you know about the water column maybe
it's time for me to
to get with the brand that uh you know
i'll just buy
because it's a superior product and a
local business
and that they don't even have a social
media presence i'm not fishing just for
sponsorships i'm uh
i'm i'm just fishing for the best
sparkling water which means that i've
gotten myself
off the bubbly train and now i'm
exclusively drinking spark mouths
the end that's the end of the story just
just one of those classic business
disputes you hear about like a daniel
plainview situation
happens all the time if it happens once
it happens a thousand times
dude this is gonna take so long i
can't believe i'm gonna do this
i drink you're bubbling i drink it up
thank god oh dude you're right they
might spawn delirium
hey normak thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
much appreciated
that makes up for the guy who said he
was gonna leave because
i was talking about taxes too much i
really appreciate it we're now back to
neutral on this run i appreciate it
we've made it back to neutral we'll
probably lose a few more
because this is not really the most
honorable way to defeat the game
but you know sometimes zero like
treading water is good enough man
i can live with that
is this a new character or a new item
it's kind of both
like so this is uh tainted forgotten
so you play as the spirit and you can
throw the the skulls
to generate uh extra damage
a lot quite a lot of extra damage to be
real
um but then
we also have nod leaf and apparently i
think it's
bugged or maybe this is working as
intended but
nod leaf gives you um
basically complete invincibility as long
as you never shoot
or touch any buttons on your keyboard i
think i almost just lost the run
because someone in chad said what
happens if you press bombs and i was
my brain didn't even run it past the the
executive function
section the prefrontal cortex it just
went i'll just test it right now and
then thankfully i was in the middle of a
sentence
so i didn't and then i thought about it
for half a second it was like i'm that
will definitely one thousand percent
kill me
would have been great comedic timing
though
not wrong
we're not using our bombs for anything
anyway so
might as well check for secret rooms no
okay fair enough just throw your skull
right into the center and then leave to
play chess
[Laughter]
it's not a bad idea i kind of a kodama
was doing some good stuff for us though
like when we were using akudama and then
just walking around in a circle
i think there's some value to this as
well
man a single orbital really would have
helped out here huh
no we will be playing some chess on
friday though
i still need to to get the the schedule
completely drawn up but
um the saga of this is that in the
overcooked twitch rivals
the team that came in second um
you know we were tweeting at each other
on social media a little bit
and then toph was like he
he made an overture that bubbly never
did
about like hey you if you want to get
revenge just play me in chess
and then we like you know we worked on
the schedule a little bit i think we're
gonna get some chests done on friday
no way that's pog oh let's go
i'm glad to hear it it's always nice
when you're gonna collaborate with
someone
and then people are like this is the
best crossover let's go it's much better
than when you're like we're gonna
collaborate with this person and
everyone's like
you didn't see the news
no not levy i was going to originally do
a keepers was going to be my uh
my chess teacher
no we're not going to do a blind
sandwich taste test with the
ex uh the ex
spokesperson for subway
please dude you know what we got some hp
we could
no let's not look he's 90 dead don't
even mess with it man you got him
you got him there's no i ca if you watch
like this whole stream
i apologize or not the whole stream
there was a lot of good parts
but if you watch the this whole run all
the way through
i actually apologize like you're a
legend but this was trash
i hate that i won that way but i'm glad
to see it gone



okay i don't know what we're gonna do i
just hit slash marker
um you know what you know i know what
we're gonna do i unlocked
tainted eve today she is an active item
called samptorium
i have no idea what that means um so
we're gonna give it a try
now my friends call me bones thank you
daniel this this is uh
this is tainted eve and her her new
friend
sumptorium whatever the heck that means
so i guess you summon familiars to help
my hp
oh okay i see what's going on here i get
the picture
that was a roller coaster dude that was
a good co-op today we we did
uh we did some great work today
saw some new stuff cool synergies i'm
dead
nothing wrong with that okay start me
again tap firing is your friend with
this character
all right it's a good idea
tap firing's your friend
hey man you only got to beat these
characters seven times to unlock
everything on the posted nose so
don't don't get too disappointed
yeah her starting fire rate is 1.2
that's pretty nasty that's not good
stuff
we've made it out of worse though you
know i think this is just the standard
protocol
and what's what is standard protocol um
get mom's knife and win
it's just that easy
there you go now we can just shoot now
just don't get hit for it
anyway yeah i downloaded mlb the show 21
on the on the xbox
i don't think i will stream it
like i gotta ask it's not a huge deal
for sure
it's probably like less than five
minutes of work but i gotta like move
the tv table out
unplug the ps5 bring the xbox in here
plug it in make sure that it works with
the elgato
and all that to just uh
to do some baseball that i think a lot
of chat wouldn't be into to begin with
it's a bit of a it's it's a fool's
gamble i think
please stream it i've been following you
since 2012 just to watch you play mlb
do it i got great news if you
go you use the internet way back machine
and then look at my twitch video archive
in 2018 we did three bounties for mlb
the show
so if you've been watching for for nine
years
it has happened yeah plus we played a
lot of super mega baseball three with
mouth
save my first rodeo around the around
the diamonds
but dude repentance just it swallows up
everything right now
i wouldn't enjoy it that much dude i
appreciate the honesty honestly
i would much rather have people you know
say their their honest feeling about it
then be like i would love it
and then when it comes on they're like
i'm gonna leave to watch another
streamer
[Laughter]
that i prefer that for sure
plus like it's it's crazy like again
we've said this every time we've talked
about baseball but like i always forget
that it's not like a worldwide
sport we lived
um i mean like it's played in a lot of
places but there are like unique pockets
like much of europe where it seems like
nobody really knows
uh the rule sets which is it was
surprising to me
yeah you're playing cricket over there i
guess
yeah europe they're not on the baseball
grind they're too busy getting mad about
like soccer i think
something to do with the super league
it's a pretty big sport in canada
there's there's like canadian um
major league baseball players we got the
blue jays we used to have the expos
it's it's a popular pastime here i know
it's america's game but
like you know it's pretty popular in
canada as well
it's like the classic um
like summer sport when you're in middle
school
it's like maybe you're not agile enough
for soccer then you're like
okay well you just play baseball there's
about three minutes of exercise over the
course of a four hour long game
like let me put it this way i've said it
before but like on on my
softball team when i was growing up
there was a kid who used to drink a
two-liter bottle of soda
every single game
so any any sport where you can drink
like six cans of coke and still perform
at a reasonably high level it's probably
not
um you're not doing that much running
let's put it that way
yeah he was like 10 it was you know
probably ill-advised uh from a
health standpoint but you know it was a
different era
it's a different era i think it would be
like softball
as an adult is the sport that i would be
most interested in playing
as like a recreational league because
it's like
you know you don't have to be super
coordinated
this is this is dangerous man you don't
have to be super coordinated
um you're only
active for like a relatively short
amount of time and you get to spend the
rest
of the time just hanging out with the
with your friends in the dugout right
that sounds like fun as long as nobody
takes it like super seriously
sounds like a good time
how is it different from baseball it
just uses like a larger ball
softball like that ball is still hard
like if it hits you in the face you're
gonna be like
you're gonna be upset i cracked my my
nose on a
softball once
like we were playing catch to warm up
before the game and the guy was playing
catch with
threw the ball to me and then said look
over there
so i you know i was 10 years old i
looked over there and then he went
and i turned my head back to see what he
was reacting to
and he was reacting to the fact that the
ball was gonna hit me in the face
so then it it made me like bleed pretty
badly out of my nose but
nothing was broken and i went to the the
bathroom at the
at the baseball diamond and like cleaned
myself up and then it started to rain so
we didn't even have to play the game
anyway
like it was a total ripoff
there was there was literally no reason
for the injury whatsoever
okay don't lose the spirit heart man
file assault charges
he was kind of a jerk but i actually
feel like it's one of those things where
he didn't intend for it to go down like
that
there were times where he was a little
bit more of like uh an a-hole i think
this time he was just like
oops you know made a mistake
were you a tattler in school no
but you we got to define what it means
to be a tattler before we
before we get upset about this kind of
stuff
if someone did something that's a
victimless crime
you don't tattle that's like a given
if it's a victimless crime
you know if somebody's passing notes in
the class
oh geez louise man
oh my god restart me
if someone's um you know they they got
notes or something they're passing them
in class
you don't tattle on that it's none of
your business but if you get in trouble
for something
that you didn't do and you're like oh
actually like
you know jessica did it yeah man
you tattle you tattle this to save your
own skin in that situation
you don't you don't do the the time for
somebody else doing the crime if you
know why they did it
we have we have a knife hold on i'm also
going to
change the title thank you the balding
of isaac
yeah i don't know it's one of those
things where i'm like uh
i think if you don't tattle i thought
this would help us actually
if you don't tattle it only benefits
people that are not you i don't
understand why you wouldn't tattle in a
situation like that
it's like the rule about how like you
never talk about your salary in the
workplace
i think when you when you adhere to that
rule it only hurts you
why wouldn't you talk about your salary
and then you know get some extra
leverage over management or something
bad rule for sure that's what i'm saying
man that's right like tattling gets a
bad rap
you don't want to be like a randall
where like you're trying to get street
cred with the teacher
by being like hey guess what i saw like
stuff that was none of my business and
didn't hurt anybody
but if you're getting in trouble for
something or why
this is a spicy one what if you end up
in a situation where your teacher is
like hey
if you don't if we don't find out who
did this
then everybody's gonna miss recess i
don't know that's
i'm glad i don't find myself in those
kinds of positions anymore
but i will say in in the sixth grade um
there was a kid in our class who like
never did their homework
and then the teacher was like if you
don't do your homework tomorrow the
whole class is gonna have to stay in for
recess and then lo and behold the next
day he didn't do his homework
and the teacher was like okay everybody
misses recess then
and i was very proud of of the class
freaking i was very proud of the class
because you would think that people
would be like oh come on man like why
didn't you do your homework
but even in sixth grade everybody was
like yo the teacher is like really
overstepping here like why are 29 other
people being punished just because one
kid like
quite frankly just seems to have a very
unstable home life or something like
that like
it's too much that's not the way you're
supposed to handle even as children we
were like this is not the way you're
supposed to do this
it's an xl floor oh my god dude i'm so
happy we have some creep i'm not even
gonna shoot
okay i'm gonna start shooting
oh freaking
yeah that it's the same kid who later
um
i've told this story before but in like
11th grade
we had safety glass on our uh
on our high school front door so like it
was
near impossible to break and then he
broke it with his head
like he full disclosure this guy was
just built
different he had to go to the hospital
don't get me wrong it wasn't like he was
like this owns
he was like pretty messed up but
you gotta admire the tenacity though
we're still living somehow
tinted i'm gonna say you know it's it's
not tinted eve's fault we haven't gotten
like the greatest items of all time yet
but it's a little uh
i'm i consider myself unimpressed yet i
need a little extra
he was thrown into it or what no he just
like he just
was like i don't know what to say like i
wasn't privy to the situation but from
what i was told later he was just like
i'm mad or like hallucinating or
something and then he just
smashed it with his head like head
butted it's kind of crazy
yeah he finally remembered that in sixth
grade the teacher was rude them
insubordinate and churlish
pour one out for my man i do wonder
about that guy sometimes i'm like i
wonder what happened
i wonder what happened to wonder what
he's doing a lot of kids i went to
school with
and mouth will echo this like
i wonder what's up with them but i also
recognize that
the idea of like that that human impulse
of like oh i wonder what happened to the
super weird kid from like
fourth grade is basically the reason
facebook is like a 400
billion dollar company so i just i i
pushed that
um instinct deep down having deleted my
facebook account and instead i just say
you know what
maybe maybe we weren't meant to know
maybe that's something that that mother
nature uh hid from us for a reason
better not to know exactly
a lot of those small town papers are now
archived online
you know but come on like i guess
go to the the library and bust out the
microfiche and
be like i wonder what happened to this
guy it's
like it's uh like i'm investigating
something in uh
in like a children's detective movie or
something
bro anybody out here working like a
dictionary factory
i want to know what's the job market
like
i was thinking about it the other day
man
i don't know if there's a more well
there's probably some but like
it's got to be some of the most
antiquated
technology i hesitate to use the word
but
some of the most antiquated technology
out there right like
making print dictionaries
like surely it still exists
to some extent because schools have got
budgets to spend but like
i gotta know man like i can't remember
the last scrabble yeah you're probably
right scrabble's the only thing like
holding the
the industry together and even then
people are just looking it up on their
phones i'm sure
you're gonna be so sorry when the grid
goes down hold on we gotta
there's something at the door yes let's
just hit him with the wave
even in like 2011 when i when
i taught in south korea none of the kids
were using paper dictionaries they were
all using like the
little handheld like like palm pilot
dictionaries
so i don't know like you know if
language learning has gotten rid of
you know the dictionary use case i don't
know what the heck's uh
you know the the business outlook there
now i think we just try to stack up as
many spirit hearts as possible
then with every red heart we get as long
as we have spirit heart protection
we can spawn a familiar then every
familiar will be
you know it'll benefit us in an
increasing degree i mean this is
starting to come together
and yeah i just wonder about
merriam-webster like maybe that's why
they've
uh they've started to uh
diversify the social media they've been
pressured to put like yolo in the
dictionary and stuff like that
um my spirit hearts i used all my spirit
hearts
my mistake was it was my intention
um hey they they probably do a lot of
damage though
i mean i might be able to use glowing
hourglass but that's like uh
it's cowardice man that's cowardice
no no no no no well hold on yes yes yes
you can get him back with some torium
yeah but like you know
i don't know maybe we'll try it after
the boss let's see let's see how we do
against the boss
because i also like being able to kill
enemies in like a reasonable time frame
just something that we have not had
access to uh on any of these runs yet
i'm a sucker for trading my hp for for
life
or for damage i should say
now we are about to die or are we about
to truly live
easy take dude this is
is pretty good
um i can't imagine that this is
particularly good but
we got it anyway let's go back for that
item room
my first few runs is any tainted
character i'm just like i'm just yoloing
man like
we're experimenting we're figuring out
what the heck's going on we're figuring
out what works and what doesn't
so far uh i gotta tell you mom's knife
and brimstone
pretty much you know they work with just
about everybody
holy poop holy pooh
no come on that's just look i know i
said we were zany but i can't back that
up that's too much
that's too much yes
hold on i'm gonna go back and do it just
cause like what's the worst no we okay
fine i'm gonna do it
who cares
we got brimstone
oh what i'm using don't don't use i'll
put the charge up a shot
i got to figure out which one's charging
and which one's not charging
or which one's sumptorium or which one's
not sumptorium
sorry because we can suck them back up
okay i think that brimstone charges
slightly faster
i thought that would get rerolled too
but it's got to be
very fast like you got to use it
like look at how close these are
brimstone is a little
faster i think no samptorium's a little
faster
oh no i just keep making them without
shooting my brimstone shot
on the bright side like every time we
use it like everything dies
thank you uh
i don't know what happened to the to the
red uh familiars but that's okay
so we'll just suck them back every room
as long as we have some hp i don't i
don't see a good reason this couldn't
work
this could be neat what is this game
dude i'm just i'm hoping we get some
tears upgrades
some tears upgrades would really hit the
spot right now
excuse me
spare two seconds i'm so stupid we could
have done this with with a bomb in a key
but whatever
ah ah
come on man i got no choice
because i use my last bomb i got stuck
there dude
whatever i mean like it's still it's a
pretty good
uh option but you know it's just kind of
like it's not what i was rooting for
i guess bean could have worked that's
true
the tick play ha so true
okay smash them
uh smash them
suck them up okay moving on
boy when i watched him pick up that a
tier trinket
i was literally in
physical pain okay suck them up
dude you get a bonus after you suck them
up
is it oh no i think i just i turned red
that one time because i had all those
red hearts with no place to go
what's the downside of creating the
little things um
the little things um they they take your
hp
every time you make one we really don't
have a
choice but to
make them though
because the fire rate for brimstone
takes longer than the fire rate to
create one of those guys
so i'm hoping that'll change here
it did okay so now we can shoot but
honestly like our damage is kind of bad
i actually kind of like our previous
strategy i'm gonna i'm gonna keep it
rolling for a bit
i think there's high risk high reward
potential like you can use it to um
you can use it to stack up like a bunch
of damage and then just like
crush them with the with like a super
shot or something like that
it's kind of a neat way to play
an interesting idea as long as you got
hearts
hi spare two hearts
still got a little we got a little gas
like here i'm feeling a little bit
uncomfortable
so i'm gonna kill this guy then i'm
gonna suck them up
baby
baby did not like that that's that's for
sure
baby did not enjoy that
i'm just gonna put a bomb down here
look at the baby smile
funny baby look at the baby i don't know
what this does
cracked orb shards of knowledge
i don't know what it is but she just
heard about the tick play
no baby it's you baby you don't
understand
it was different back then times were
different back then
don't worry like i say this every time
but like babies do be
crying basically that could be good
they they just they they cry for some
reasons
they cry for no reason that's
discernible to an adult
mind
it's a it's a whole thing it's kind of
like it's their it's their deal that's
very useful
okay
call chib he'll help out real talk i
would trust just about anybody in the
rainbow six siege call to babysit my
child without
leading to physical harm however
um chib's still at the bottom of the
list
and i don't mean any offense really like
i i'm gonna just walk through it
sips number one top of the list has two
kids of his own a little bit on the
older side as well
so i i give him the the the hat tip
right out of the
gate because he's got the skills um
number two would be mouth mouth has a
lot of
young relatives i've seen him with his
young relatives he seems like a cool
uncle
um and we've been close personal friends
for
for many years so i think that he would
have he would treat it with the decorum
that i would ask him to treat it with
which is important following that
um i know corey in real life
i have seen him uh
in interact in the real world i have
confidence that he would
he's able to handle life's challenges
that might uh
come up so he he gets the third spot and
then in the fourth spot just by default
it's chib
all i know about chib he's he's got a
knack for the cool guy voice
and he is single-handedly like keeping
the peyronie
brand of imported loggers like
off the off the bankruptcy papers
that's that's all i know
and he may he might have a gambling
problem
[Laughter]
and he met aragorn's horse that's right
he also met aragorn's horse
which is pretty i mean that's something
man
i would definitely prefer to have chib
watch my child than a random person in
chat that's not even close
i don't you think i want someone from
chat to get in an argument with my baby
like that's that's the the number one
thing i would be concerned about
there is a tinted rock in there amazing
yeah the baby would probably win too and
then people would be like oh the baby's
been real toxic lately
i'm not just mad that i lost an argument
to a baby
just the baby's vibe has been off lately
doesn't anybody else agree no
okay well moving on then
okay golden bomb secret
room
insubordinate and churlish
i mean i think if you're a parent or
you've babysat before
babysitting is like 99
one of the easiest jobs you could ever
do and then one percent
a mortal fear that you have like you're
gonna lead
this child to oblivion accidentally like
i i think it's like
moments of just boredom punctuated by an
extreme amount of anxiety would be what
i would expect
uh from from babysitting
like i watched that episode of the
simpsons the other day where um
lisa babysits bart and then bart's just
being an a-hole
and he's like oh check it out like i'm
not gonna eat my vegetables or go to bed
like
he was just being like very josh-like
right and then he falls down the stairs
and breaks his arm and gets a big bump
on his head
and i was like you know what good you
deserve it man
that's what you get for being a butthole
to your sister
hang on let me look at that wheelbarrow
just as i thought a yard king that's a
heck of a barrel
all right have a good night lisa this is
some great moments in that
great good good show man season eight
man great great uh
great bit of television no doubt about
it
hey you open the door for me so thank
you
my diagnosis
bad babysitting
dude i also realized there's a there's a
season 8 episode of uh
the simpsons where they have an out of
control st patrick's day party like i
wonder if that
inspired some of my distaste for st
patrick's day
it's definitely possible i grew up
watching like two episodes of the show a
day for almost a decade
certainly would not surprise me hello
wow baby's rice arrived how about that
so exciting
okay i would give the baby a high a high
outfit rating
it looks very nice sleeveless fit for
the weather
cop this cop this look
yeah that's good stuff
hold on what's there's a super secret
room
look at that we're good right we're just
moving on we're just moving on yeah
we're just moving on
hello baby hi
there's me there's me
hello
go to the room how am i supposed to get
there man
you gotta find a red key odds i think
pretty low
unfortunately
you can borrow my okay that's fine
is there any could i possibly maybe for
our anniversary i could buy you your own
phone
i'm not sure about that one
just uh every stream comes in can i
borrow your phone to take some cute
photos
hmm you know what i can't oh matchbook
matchbook and i'll be okay
wednesday anniversary uh our anniversary
is in the middle of may
but i also already got her her
anniversary present in like
february so
real question is what's she gonna get me
she got me a cell phone that's true
that's a good point
okay overachiever thank you
it wasn't the air fryer okay and i'm
also i'm not an overachiever when it
comes to gift giving my wife's just very
straightforward
she's like hey like can i get this
and you buy it and it can be your
anniversary gift to me
and i'm like dude honestly i know that
some people will look at that and be
like that's like not romantic or
whatever
is actually such an enormous
quality of life improvement that like
i would never look uh i would never try
to find the problem with it let's put it
that way
it's actually awesome
i never have to think about
uh what to get and then worry if it's
the right thing
instead and some there have been times
where i've just i've just asked and i've
been like hey you know christmas is in
like six weeks like
what would you like
this is a good get for us for sure we
roll into
the matchbook that's that's still pretty
good let's suck this up for a sec let's
think about this
i'm like the opposite like to be honest
i know this seems like
it's either a flex or like people always
assume you're being disingenuous
they'll say things like um you know like
no but what do you really want
but honestly like the best gift
that someone who's not extremely close
to me
like like either my parents or my wife
the best gift they could give me
is genuinely nothing
i would rather receive nothing than most
things
no i don't even want like like money
because then it starts the reciprocity
i'm not like oh i don't want you to get
me something so that i have to get you
some like i'm not worried about buying
the gift
is just like like why am i like
every year i gotta like buy my uncle a
gift and then my uncle's gotta buy me a
gift too and we haven't seen each other
since like 2014.
it just seems it just seems weird i got
nothing against my uncle but why
are we both uh you know just funding the
the gift card companies
and then like secondarily like why not
get in something that he cares about i
don't even know who he is man
we've had like uh you know we ate
thanksgiving dinner together
15 times over the course of my
adolescence and then i think that's it
we live different world in different
worlds we we run in different circles
what the heck is evil charm man
yeah i'm not like a gift guy that's why
kate what i was saying by the way was
uh i uh i
very much appreciate that when my wife
wants something
she just goes hey can you get me this
for like an occasion or something like
that
it's much nicer than the alternative of
being like i don't know what i'm
supposed to get her and she's like oh
well you should know me by now and i'm
like that's now it's like
it's supposed to be like a happy day
where everybody's having oh yeah tinted
skull tinted skull
it's supposed to be a a happy day
where everybody's having a good time
instead i'm freaking stressed out trying
to divine
like sherlock holmes style exactly what
you know she's looking for
which we i'm i'm very thankful i don't
have to go through that
okay hey hey hold on what things do we
need to hit on the posted note to get
unlocks oh you're right i didn't need
the i didn't leave a trinket behind at
all
yeah see
but i will say and and this is more like
oh you don't need to anymore whatever
i'm i'm going
look what's this part of the post-it
note right here what's this
because that's where we're going
that's boss rush and hush son of a
we had a lot of excel floors we might be
kind of in the running
it's possible it's possible
why is your mouse so large on this on
this screen
i have to imagine it's got something to
do with the fact that i'm playing in
like
640 by 480. no we
obviously we can't do boss rush i mean
hush is
thank possible but yeah i will admit
like there's no
uh sorry to say the same word again
um but there's like no reciprocity
because like i think i'm very annoying
to buy gifts for
because i don't want anything and i
mean it but you can't just
give nothing because then it becomes
like you know
like if if we were at like a family
gathering and i gave kate something and
then
she didn't give me something people
would be like what's up with that and
they wouldn't believe me
they would be like yeah just because you
said you wanted nothing but what you
really wanted was like that t-shirt
that was like you know sorry i couldn't
come to the phone i was fishing or
something like that and i'm like nah man
i'm like
i really just like i i want for nothing
for the most part
i'm like it's not an ulterior motive
like you should know what to give me
it's genuinely just like
i i've already got too much stuff if
anything
yeah i need i just want a shirt that
says women love me fish fear me that's
that's the dream
dude we can actually make hush
we can't lose this much hp though oh
you're dead okay let's go let's go
we take because we want the spear at
heart and then we go down to the next
floor
we've got two and a half minutes two and
a half minutes baby
no problem monday baby
frick like i don't even know
like i mean all i want is like food
that's the thing
it's like if you're if if any family
members are watching this and they're
like oh we gotta get him a gift like for
christmas next year
honestly just buy me like an ubereats
gift card or something like that's
that's the greatest gift for me even
though gift cards are kind of normally
like a crappy gift
that's a great gift for me because i
will never pay
the ubereats price to order something
for myself
and have it delivered because it's too
expensive especially for like a single
meal
but if i had like a gift card burning a
hole in my pocket or something like that
then i could be persuaded
socks also very helpful nothing wrong
with that
my mom gives me a bunch of beef jerky
every year and it's sick
i hear you man like that's that's what
it's all about
beef jerky candied salmon
whatever whatever you got we're gonna
probably
die to hush but i'm gonna try anyway why
not
yeah and then i also like don't um
we don't have like a ton of space so i i
greatly prefer to
get gifts that don't take up room
ideally
dude what if these guys just blew up in
the fire that would be so sad
that's true if you want to like give me
a bigger house
that that would be something these are
incredible items this is
this is unbelievable
that's probably gonna be our re-roll
anti-grav is really not good with
brimstone
pause button i don't think does what we
needed to do
um i don't know this will give us more
familiars at least
i will take the mystery sack
that's that's a quality item and then
i will also re-roll this hp upgrade
conjoined could no conjoined
um and i think i'll pop the strength
card anyway
yeah this could be okay
dude that's pretty good damage
oh gish doesn't count for conjoint oh i
must have missed the
the tie-in novel
that explains that rule yo magneteers
pretty sick i'm gonna be honest we
definitely
should be creating some more statues
here
we can always suck them up later if we
want
you know statues whatever the heck these
things are
what the
yo get out of here dude
the static yes the static
my mistake excuse me um
a static is something that you join in
final fantasy
to get yelled at for not standing in the
right spot when ifrit uses his demon
claw attack
i think you must be confused
dude this is actually really easy
i thought we were gonna run into way
more trouble
turns out having like 12 brimstones is
pretty solid
didn't lose much hp that was great that
was that was a great time i mean we
might as well do void right like
while we're here i i don't know if it's
gonna be easy but there's definitely a
chance
yeah i don't even think we got hit there
that was kind of amazing you got to do
it at some point why not now right
that's the other thing you could give me
you could give me eight shares of the
vanguard uh
all uh total world stock market index
i don't know if they if they give gift
receipts but
it's either that or ubereats it's up to
you
okay don't lose hp you need as much as
possible
so that you can turn it into damage
delirium should be a cakewalk because of
magnetized tears
okay i'll take your word for it i don't
i don't fight this guy too much anymore
oh that's true yeah if you wanted to
give me like some berkshire hathaway
like i'll i'll be honest if you if you
don't want to buy me eight shares of
veqt how about one share of berkshire
hathaway class a
it's a little bit smaller but i would
definitely accept it either way
i'm not gonna turn up my nose at that
the joke there by the way is that i
think every uh
class a share of berkshire hathaway is
like 350
000 us dollars or something
and 403 thousand good good for them
wasted charge key
haha so true so you got me
i'm very embarrassed right now
what about a couple class b's look i
mean
if if money's tight and you can't buy me
the the 400
000 uh share then like
honestly i just don't show up okay
make yourself scarce
i take
this could be the the uh
void but or delirium i should say but
i'm gonna do it anyway
doesn't bother me guess what get bodied
dude you know what i'll take it i'm not
scared
why are we getting um angel items though
is is this a a buff to the void
or is it just like any item pool can
show up down here and we're just getting
like kind of lucky to get angel items
i don't know it's interesting though
it's random item pools
please please i'm just remembering now
that this run is like
it's only by sheer luck that we're in
such a good position
and every other time you know we we
tried to make tinted uh eden work it
didn't turn out at
all i'm remembering we gotta keep our
heads screwed on straight here otherwise
we're gonna have to
do some really tough stuff as this
character again so i'm gonna remind
myself
to just you know think with your noggin
who would have
who would have thought full run reroll
not tinted eden yeah sorry uh tainted
eve you know what i mean
aren't all the characters just isaac
anyway
i don't think so bloat
oh you guys haven't read the tie-in
novel by brandon sanderson
it's pretty decent it's hard to say no
to that
what popular game would you never play
on stream
so the
honest answer i mean the answer is many
for sure
but i think the honest answer
is like anything
that is super long and super story
driven
man that was a bad pick up on that we
could swallow the tick though now that i
think about it
uh anything super long and super story
driven is not a good fit
for me for others more power to you but
like
i guess this isn't aaa but what popped
up in my head was
um disco elysium
historically they they don't do super
well um
in fact they do the opposite pretty
badly
they stretch on longer than my attention
span
can hold they're a lot of work for me to
make it
my own brand of interesting and
the vibes in chat don't pass the vibe
check usually
instead of having fun conversations it's
all about like oh you really should use
uh the yodenheim frost breath before you
use the
launcher otherwise you're leaving like
.63 damage on the table
and i'm like you know i was just trying
to talk about like
whole wheat bread and you're out here
you're like you're screwing the vibes up
man
he didn't even do the bike mission
i'm going home to lola as well
okay you can't hurt me because i have
magnet tears
so you're trash
no tomo i i can't let you in my office
anymore
every time the office door opens it
creates like an hour-long period of
bedlam well like we can go through this
if you want people are like but you
played
skyrim and i'm like yeah that's why you
should trust me
when i say that it's a bad fit because
like this the skyrim
deus ex human revolution corridor of
sunday streams like
it taught me something let's just put it
that way
the witcher 3 playing the witcher 3 for
six months on stream
tell me a little something about about
myself a lot about living and a little
about love
our skyrim playthrough wasn't even that
long it was only like like a couple
weeks but
oh no it might have been like a month
and a half but still
i mean this is i i gotta recognize that
the conversation like always goes in
this direction
but people are like well you stream
longer now so like
wouldn't it be easier to play them yeah
but they like they don't they don't
perform
you know like i don't know what i can
really i don't know what else i can
really say
like they what what's blowing up here
it's his shots okay
hey i've said it like you know
a thousand times i know not everyone's
here for it but
it's less like oh they don't fit and
more like you know i don't like playing
them and also they do pretty badly
[Laughter]
i don't know if people are under the
illusion that the all streamers are out
there being like i just wish i had the
time to play
persona 5 on stream i'm like i i would
rather play
60 mechanics driven games for an hour
than than touch persona
we have unlocked sumptorium it got a
little close
it got a little close for comfort but we
we made it happen either way
yo true god of war but you don't
understand this isn't the counter
argument that's like i
but you played god of war in the past
you played skyrim in the past you played
deus ex
because i played those in the past and i
remember the experience which was
god of war for me was like three hours
of fun
followed by like 20 hours of people
literally suggesting i was a sociopath
because i made a single joke at the
ending of the game
when i was supposed to be in tears
instead
you know that's uh
that's why i don't want to go back and
play it again pretty much
but it you know it works for other
streamers and it doesn't work for me
you know it's uh everybody's uh
everybody's different
anyway i'm gonna go to the bathroom real
quick click the follow button it is it's
4
20. we were trying to get 420 000
followers by 4 20.
we're not quite there
we're at 418.3 but i'm uh
you know we're close we're eager at
least
i'm gonna go back to the bathroom and uh
let tomo in and i'll be right back



okay sure why not why not
um
let me think about this
have you beaten team out oh yeah
i mean i did i did you wanna do double
dude it's too much like people
you know my philosophy that like people
don't know what they want
like there's just every i beat team out
and then the the run failed me because
it turned my trophy into a bomb
and then that everyone's just asking for
team out every
like every run since they're like
literally like i could finish a team out
run be three seconds into another run
and they're like he doesn't do t-melt
anymore
and i'm like look at the post-its i got
a billion
things is still on i gotta close my eyes
we'll bring team out back but i don't
want to do it just yet because it's like
it's one of those things where when you
overdose on zayn it stops being zany
i understand it's you got to give it a
little time to plus
i did team melt mouth did team out that
you're doing team out we got there's too
much team out going on in the community
right now
we're where the the the ocean is is low
on tuna
i it it we've overfished it temporarily
is my
is my take dude do you ever ever play as
uh
this guy right here no i don't even know
what is that after birth plus plus
uh i think yeah this was added in after
birth plus i've never played it we get
bone
yeah so you don't you don't know what
this guy even does then no
okay so bone that's him right there the
skull yeah
so you can you can smack which does a
lot of damage
you can come here come here real quick
just
look to the right and hold to the right
what does that look like
uh what what does it look like nothing
[Laughter]
you can also i don't know what button it
is so this is like even more confusing
but you can become the loss temporarily
as well
it is daniel
oh kate's gonna ask you a question about
probably your your instagram
she sent me a dm on instagram
okay so kate is asking you why on
instagram you took a photo of
uh a piece of bread in a tupperware
container
so that she would ask me what it was no
i don't believe that for a second
sometimes i just post what i think looks
cool man i thought it was like a
hardened cracker
like what is it like an artisan cracker
it was like basically adult lunchables
and i'm like yo this cracker looks kind
of cool okay i
zoomed in on it so like you it's like
melv's brother's photos you're like i
don't really know what this is
okay so he said that sometimes he just
takes photos of things that he thinks
look cool like for example kate
my last post she said this is a great
photo oh i'm like yeah
okay so apparently on his last post you
said
this is a comment commented this is a
great photo
you can pick that up go ahead and pick
that up what'd she say
she she is not i don't think she knew
that i was talking to her at the moment
oh yeah so on dan's last post
she said keep it up there no she said
this is a great photo
she said this is a great photo
keep it was it was it a photo of him
[Laughter]
yeah what'd she say there's a photo
she said she she recognized what you're
talking about now yeah
instagram man oh she said you should
frame this picture
she said you should frame this picture
is that true yeah it looks really nice
that same thing with the cracker picture
it's the same well it's not the same but
close different genre anyway
okay you know you know how malf's
brother takes photos that
are like they look kind of cool and he
sells them
he said it was kind of like that
he took a picture of a hardened baguette
and then uh
oh you should pick up that right there
yeah oh look
tell kate if she she doesn't love me at
my ansel she doesn't get me in my
campbell
okay um he said if you don't love me
at my ansel you don't get me at my
campbell
i don't really know what i think he's
making a reference to ansel adams
and also yeah and also andy warhol who
painted a campbell soup can
that's as far as my dangling goes though
that's all i got that's very accurate
you're 99.9 percent accurate
yeah let me protect that because if you
get uh
if we get deals with the devil i can
actually take them and die and it's no
problem
why because i i can take them as the
spirit marty
as you would say and then um
just become the bone lord before i
actually die and we got nothing to fear
yo hear me out real talk i feel like
eddie if you put him in the lab for
another five years
he could extend this this game to two
decades
it is crazy right like like repentance
is so
content rich oh please please oh
look at look at the eyeballs man wait
look down can you look down
quick quick thumbnail thumbnail
wait i want the bones touching hold on
look at that yo yo hear me yeah okay
that's good
you versus the you she told you not to
worry about
but no i'm not even meaning like i feel
like if you put eddie in the lab
he can make this game relevant for the
next 10 years dude i don't disagree
like uh i'm happy he's going to do
something else
like for his sake as well yeah because
i'm sure he's probably like i don't want
to see this game again for a little bit
but uh like they repentance was an
amazing like
parting gift oh don't donate them donate
them
have you seen this you got to just
just dodge him for like 30 seconds
without doing any damage
you're gonna love this this this is
gonna be part of your isaac repertoire
for sure
okay trusting the pilot yeah if you get
hit don't sweat it
look at this tell me the tell me the
plane's going down do not put on your
oxygen mask
i'm with you just keep it going don't
worry about it getting a little
light-headed here a little light-headed
just hold your breath
there he goes what
he just left yeah and then you can pick
that up right there
but don't don't press the button when
you get it yet
plum flute you can take the other one
too i don't know what it's even going to
do
of storms or something dude get ready
okay yeah
pop it down here
he's on our team he's on our team now
what he's actually playing with he does
a lot of damage
what's the lore you didn't kill him so
he comes back to
to help you oh i don't even know if this
will work but
oh can you hit control or whatever
button turns yeah okay now check this
out um
okay
yeah you could do the same on duality if
you want but you got to do it fast
you get so as soon as you take it you
got to hit the button to swap back
is duality good and it's fun it's worth
taking i guess
wait it's gone now oh you know what
oh i can't become uh i can't become
a double duality yeah we could double
that's so much coordination
we can do it we can do it next time all
right all right i like that you got a
little
uh trinket on your bauble right no thank
you
well thank you man look at that um let's
not do alt path like
that's a lot to keep in mind right like
yeah don't get it up
but i know you love the streamer room so
i've never
seen somebody so happy to go to the
chest like you're always
like so exhilarated you get four items
in there
dude well here's my thing is that so i
grew up on twitch
watching cobalt right right yeah and you
know so you played flash isaac
and then you'd see him get there and
you're like oh my god that's amazing and
i
feel like in my isaac lifetime i've
gotten there like three or four times
and you're just like man the
exhilaration of like up down up down and
you just see items everywhere to me
that's like
peak loot boxing there have been a lot
of times
i mean sometimes you come down there and
it's like it's pure garbage but
there have been a lot of times as well
where like you open up
four just absolutely beautiful items
it's exactly what you asked for
like it's kind of incredible
it's good it's just it's eddie you know
this guy can't disagree there's no way
you've only been to the chest
four times like i guarantee less than
ten
do it do it oh i stole it sorry
[Laughter]
narrator was he really sorry i i forgot
you can grab things with the bone
i i thought you would fly up and and
snag it but
obviously mission uh mission failed
ooh bbm let's do this pretty
you know what no we need there's options
uh more options now we can get double
item rooms
okay and now we can get into the the
item room as well how do we get double
items
because that gives a choice in the item
room
but with two people it's not a choice
anymore it's just
uh we can we can take both yeah
now this character is a little unique
but i kind of like them
they're one of the easier characters to
win with for sure
but it's it's just fun you know like
melee in this game
it's fun if you if your body gets hit
would you want the other one for sure
yeah yeah oh you take it
we can take it both we can take it both
no no no i have so much more damage i
need rod and baby
okay three two
one go oh good enough
good enough oh
sorry so one thing that i skipped on
isaac i want your
your first grade on i really kind of
skipped the greed stuff
oh yeah oh one second this freaking cat
you
get out of good stop being behind the
monitor you stinky
okay one one moment please yeah and then
let's get
he gets monitor in like a place where i
can't
uh grab him so annoying
yo get out of there
you're not supposed to begin with
there we go you can tell he jumped
because there was like an
earthquake that went off okay can we get
an updated thumbnail real quick
yeah what do you need hey okay then
we'll go hit him with a little
this and a little of that
okay we got thumbnails um so
greed mode people like oh dan you'd like
greed mode
but you got to have your your donation
machine filled up for it
that right i don't know actually uh
do you did you like it at the time not
really
okay like i i don't have anything like
against the
green mode but it's not my it's not my
favorite mode
it's fine like it you have to do it to
unlock
stuff and it's like a nice diversion
like if i've only got 20 minutes left to
do a run
um then i'm not gonna do a normal run
i'll knock out some greed or something
instead but
uh yeah let me take hourglass because
you've already got an item
and we we can do it like this yeah
okay three hold on hold on i think the
distance
i think i have a shorter distance than
you this cup just i know you don't
believe it but just come feel it just
quick feel
get a quick feel see how close that is i
think it's camera tricks but
you know i i can understand here okay no
no we
just stand at the second rock here yeah
yeah
okay look good to you
yeah three two one
go oh that hurts
that one hurt but it's not our no that's
not our normal
we go up down normal probably should
have stuck with the wall i imagine
i'm telling you i was supposed to i was
closer
i would be back i don't think so i think
it's it's camera tricks
um i think it's
is that what you said about the moon
what do you mean
i am i'm a noted uh moon conspiracy
theorist
really yeah i don't think it's actually
like a real
celestial body i think it's just ed
harris up there telling the
all the actors what to do
oh you believe in the moon i yes i
believe in the moon that's correct
well sometimes you know it's no judgment
zone you never know right
in this day and age
you'll be talking to somebody and then
like all of a sudden they'll be like uh
oh did you know ian won big brother fair
and square and you're like oh i didn't
know you were one of those
and his name is bruh that's money dude
you know he says it so that i can't say
it but i can't say it so i'm glad he
said it
something like that imagine is what's
going on on the other end here
i'm taking that lasagna heart for that
well it wasn't an it was a compliment it
was it was a compliment
yeah oh i'm taking all of them go ahead
doesn't bother me
i was saying it was uh is a conspiracy
theory to believe that he won
fair and square because we all know the
truth
it's fine
[Laughter]
so i should be bringing back plum paga
here right
uh yeah you can do it once every four
rooms so like
i mean i don't know here because i'm
just gonna
i'm just gonna like dumpster him but
i like that he makes a little whistle it
is a nice sound
uh are you playing baseball today uh not
on the street i don't think i'm gonna
stream it
i honestly and we've talked about this
like in the back channel but like
isaac has just steamrolled everything
man
like i'm trying to put extra variety in
today's variety is going to be like
co-op and then single player exactly
plus like
um i don't think it matters i'll pick up
the first one oh that dude take it
that's so good
that's like the best damage upgrade in
the game i thought i'm not throwing
speeds
what how come i'm not throwing skeets
chat what what's he talking about
how come i'm not throwing teeth oh
sites science okay we'll change into the
other character
look at that oh now if my static gets
hit do i get hit
if your static gets hit do you get yeah
your hitbox becomes the
the lost oh not the static
this is the static yeah that is just uh
that's like a defensive orbital
basically
okay that's cool i like that a lot
um oh hit control first or whatever
swaps you
look at that um but yeah
also the other thing i don't know if
you're in the same boat
in fact i would go ahead and take that
as well this is pretty good
i actually think that you're in the
opposite boat um
but so your choice is you can either
buy it for like 80 canadian dollars on
ps5
yeah f or
you could get it for free on microsoft
game pass
so that was an easy decision but then
my xbox is in uh
is in the other room you know what no
you need to explain nothing more there's
so many variables to play a game
that you don't have to play like it was
easy like oh it's a one button marty
you're probably playing it
right after this but it's not i mean i
already got it downloaded on the xbox
it's really just do i want to move that
into my office just to play baseball for
40 of my normal audience when instead i
could just play isaac for
the normal amount and then play a little
baseball uh
in my down time yeah dan i believe in
you
i can't do it because i'd be risking a
bone heart you could use your
your loss though i think i need the lost
[Laughter]
there you go that so there no no no no
no
[Laughter]
you know what let me get the other one
this oh my god
[Laughter]
okay tell me that tell me the bottom's
closer to the bottom then you just get
on the bottom on this one
three two one go
hey
um yeah suck with chat earlier i said
i'm battling not to just go full isaac
because it's fun and it does great
it's the perf it's a quality problem to
have it's definitely not a negative
so i've been mixing in like a little
variety but there really is like a low
incentive to mix it up too much now like
i mean i played this game on sunday i
played it all the way through
called say no more it was really good i
had a great time playing it and
analytically it did well as well but how
would you describe it what is it
um i'm trying to think it it's like a
it's like a short um
oh that's betty what was that
i i don't have a good answer for that
it's pretty unique
it's like a narrative adventure game it
was almost like a walking simulator type
deal but it was very funny it was like a
comedy game
was it actually funny or was it like oh
no it was that's why like it was
genuinely funny which
is uh is not typical i would say let's
not
open that we need uh let me let me get
that okay okay okay
but then like i'm like dude that's my
variety for like
almost a week i've got some other stuff
lined up but yeah like it's it's really
hard to go with the same degree of
variety like
because isaac is just it's people like
watching it is so good
loot box it's just it's just good
entertainment plus
it's like it's a once in a lifetime
thing man i was getting let's not
say annoyed but like you know some of
the comments on youtube are like man
like i hope isaac like doesn't last
forever because i miss variety
and i'm like well good news for you i
posted six overcooked videos two pummel
party
videos and four rainbow six siege videos
in like the last eight days and they're
like ah yeah
my bad i just
i just didn't want to watch those but i
was like say what you want just say what
you really think which is please bring
back chess
i don't know why you gotta you gotta
shelter it in some kind of like
defensible package when instead you're
like you know
just say what you want bring back chess
no i'd like not to check to wire it but
like uh i was thinking like sometimes
you play variety
sometimes you play variety so you find
the pog
and then here you find the pog and
you're like you know what i mean
absolutely like korea and luck be a
landlord and stuff like that like that
was
um wait it's not called pyria
whatever okay okay
don't let's not get hit this time check
this out just smack him instead i have
historically have a problem with that
okay i i like to play variety because
also
not only on twitch like it keeps things
interesting but like also on youtube it
keeps things interesting for everybody
so i've still been mixing in variety but
like you know this is kind of like a
once in a
every few years sort of situation this
is not a it's not a typical one so i
i appreciate when people have some
understanding and also when you
you know you publish variety stuff and
it does like badly
then you're like well what do you expect
[Laughter]
i hate to say it but you know hey can we
play this i need i need a hort we play
well we both need a horde we play this a
few times
sure yeah there you go
look at that yeah thank you it's a cool
character now that i know you can like
shoot size with it
only only with uh death's touch but yeah
it's nice but i i think it's like a good
way to describe it you know like
i've watched moneyball again recently i
feel like when
when no pogridge stuff is apparent you
know when you don't have the
steinbrenner budget
that's when you gotta oh use your uh
your flute
there you go that's when you got that
that's when you got a scout right
that's when you got to pick up david
justice because he gets on base
but when you got the steinbrenner money
you're like just give me uh
you know a-rod yeah just give me just
give me the the the best uh
the best player wait so if i pick up the
sole it goes to my
boss it's correct but don't pick it up
yeah you take it no no no not even
because check this out dude
oh and i got another one yeah okay
oh baby doesn't help at all but
then i'll pick it up okay
i'll take i'll take
both both pretty bad honestly
all right we go to a streamer room we're
we're on our way yeah
okay don't worry about it we're on our
way trust the pilot
rest in the pocket it's pretty linear
like like airplanes it just flies itself
all right nice and easy is uh
is it starting to get nice in vancouver
dude for like the last
uh week and a half it's been
close to 20 degrees celsius which i
don't know it's probably like 75
uh fahrenheit oh nice and sunny like
it's been i've been taking the baby out
for walks it's been
it's been amazing monstrous tooth
yeah why not okay
three two one go
so so in sync
yeah so yeah it's been like it's been
beautiful i have to keep reminding
myself because it you know everyone's
out like picnicking and stuff like that
and you're like you know it's april like
it's probably gonna
it's not gonna last forever but you know
i've been enjoying uh
you know side eyeing the people uh not
respecting social distance while i walk
with the baby uh
you know on the same like four kilometer
lap every single day
do you think you'll ever get back into
the biking game um
honestly like i think i might just buy
an exercise bike yo get a peloton then
we can challenge
oh you get do it i was gonna say because
basically like last year
my parents uh were like hey like your
dad got a peloton
and he like really likes it can we get
you one and i was like oh don't do it
like
the babies come in and like we don't
have that much space
and then you know it's been like another
six months of being indoors since then
and i'm like you know what they were
right i should have gotten the peloton
it shouldn't i should have taken them up
on that so
i think dude i don't know if i'll get a
peloton but i'll get something something
similar
imagine playing isaac with your legs
that's what a peloton is
it sounds kind of negative really
yeah like a loot bar so like you can
like pick your coach i mean there's a
billion
yeah it's like there's like you can
there's like a live leaderboard so you
can see like
who's done the class or you can go hey i
want to go against people in my same age
bracket or whatever so you get ranked
but the best part is
you like i mean it's kind of what do you
call it parasocial
paranormal relationships i don't think
that that's more of a mathis thing
but um so you pick like the coach that i
mean you can take whatever coach video
you want
but like there's some coaches that
you're like yo they're pretty good
oh you know and the one that i like
when she's about to turn up and be like
hey it's about to get hard you need to
turn your dial up
she's like yes or yes and i'm like
[Laughter]
where's my option and then she already
got you
you know yo that's that's pretty sick
um these these are none of these are
very good really um
pass on grass oh it hit control though
for a sec
might as well right oh triple bone
what are you uh i'm i got triple boost
now
no okay you ready for this yes this is
an important one right
not really but you should definitely get
yours but
three two one go
very well and then i don't think it
really matters but
um i think you should take the yeah i
agree actually
three two one go
dude we got it under control this is
okay all right we're going down we
yeah going down all right but yeah i
think i might get one
like uh basically i'm just like
you know i i know that like oh there's
the peloton like uh they're they're more
expensive than like other varieties
and then there's like uh oh they had
that commercial that everyone dunked on
and i'm like dude i'm like
gelatin had a commercial that got dunked
on yeah it was like the the peloton wife
commercial
i never said what is it it's like i'm
not gonna dredge up
like i mean you dressed up michael
douglas i mean let's get dredging yeah
but that's
i mean it's just like it's not even
there's no meat to to grind from it you
know like there's no
it's bad yeah well it's smart it's not
bad it's just like if you weren't there
like it's like
hey did you know people on the internet
were mad for a reason
18 months ago like let me tell you about
it
i got you but anyways you're saying
there's a lot of options
no i'm just saying like now i'm like i
don't care i'd rather just like you know
pay for it and then have it here and
then maybe use it and lose like 20
pounds
that's like a better option for like my
overall happiness than
being like well it's not perfect so
instead i'm just going to
just i'm going to maintain an air of
moral superiority by not ever getting it
and then just die when i'm like 57
instead of 78. but i feel like there's a
there's like a dad chart where it's like
okay roughly around
you know when you're having a baby and
the pregnancy is going on you know you
you double up and eat and then you're
like who cares you get used to life
and then until life gets normy again and
then once it gets normal you're like i
should probably do some normy stuff like
work out
yeah you're like i'm not gonna be the
parent of a newborn forever so the
excuses are quickly uh
like falling by the wayside is basically
what it's all about
if you you could tackle that guy for me
that would be it yeah i got it it'd be a
big help
dan do you know if you just would have
excuse me
[Laughter]
what's chaos uh it it insta kills
almost every boss in the game oh it's
pretty good
especially i can't help but notice it
looks like chaos or
from magic the gathering eddie it's
really good especially if your co-op
partner never uses
their plum flute to to kill bosses
faster
okay you get it
um you know what this might be on campus
so yeah either way it was i think that
was the right call
why is your skull so wide because
because there's three of me man there's
three
um
that bad either let's check uh oh i
thought that might be second secret room
but
it's fine okay
how about a w you think we can pull out
this w let's go prop it
will ryan gary and i win it honestly
should be easy
it should this should be so automatic as
to
like if anybody bets on doubt they
deserve it
dude i should be living in the bubble
right now i should be playing this
bubble
you can play as bubble if you want i
mean like look we just i one-tapped that
boss like this is a very very
solid run just check this real quick
nice dude hit me with a good movie
i've been like dar starved for good
movies
yeah um i i mean i haven't seen a movie
in forever either honestly
i'm trying to i mean have you seen
moneyball yeah
i've seen money ball that's good that's
honest i've i haven't been watching
movies on purpose
like sometimes i have like an extra 45
minutes when i'm looking after the baby
and she's just chilling
so i'll just turn on like amc and uh
it only plays the karate kid movies and
money ball this month so
yo what else what more you need i've
seen a lot of money ball let's put it
that way
they're going to say documentaries oh
watch the occasional documentary for
sure
we do we ever talk well i already talked
about it earlier do we ever talk about
chip with the dip
what is chip with a dip i don't think
we've talked about it
so chip with the dip you'd like it it's
canadian so when the
when the raptors won the nba
championship
there was this interview with drake and
he kept saying i want my chip with the
dip i want my chip with the dip wolves
cringe haha spam and chat
i'm like what the heck is he talking
about right now yeah
so i've been watching this uh
netflix documentary called last chance
you basketball
edition and it's about this like
junior college that team that's you know
got
you know some players that all got in
trouble but anyway so they win their
league championship it's not a spoiler
and this kid starts going i want my chip
with the dip and he keeps pointing to
his
his finger ring his finger his ring
finger
and then somehow the euphemism of chip
with the dip means put a ring on the
finger
follow me kind of but
so my point is you think danglish is bad
chip with the dip
is not what you think it is so to come
full circle
yeah if that is what we've been doing
did we did we leave a place and now
we're coming back to it because yeah
the comfortable circle here's the deal
if
you were at a restaurant now and you're
with someone
and they double dip in the modern age
are you deleting them from your phone
um i'm i'm i'm torn on it
you probably shouldn't don't get me
wrong sorry about that that's that's my
bad
but i do sort of feel like as well okay
hold on
i don't know what that does i'll be the
experiment yeah
magic skin all your desires fulfilled
sister maggie
wow that's incredible maybe does it give
you a familiar like every time you use
it or something but it costs you hp
i don't know that's weird
so would you delete someone from your
phone for doing that
if they weren't uh a friend of like okay
if if it's
husband and wife we both know the rules
are different
if you're if your wife double dips
you're not gonna be yeah it's like you
already
yeah you already michael douglas saying
that anyway
why don't why don't you take the eternal
heart there
what's a broken heart yeah i guess it
can't ever be filled again
oh so you got like one hp from it
forever
like if i don't know it i mean it
depends on the appetizer right like if
you got nachos and then they had like
salsa or sour cream on the side
you shouldn't be double dipping but i
just feel like grabbing the tortilla
chip with your hand to begin with and
then dipping you're probably getting a
similar cross-section of germs
so i wouldn't be i know you shouldn't
double dip
i don't do it in a in a public context
but i'm also like
i i think it's maybe you know if you're
in for a penny you're kind of in for a
pound to begin with i think
speaking of a pound i need uh we need to
go play that that money
money ball guy all right all right
i don't know what you're talking about
though when you say the money ball guy
this oh this guy right here oh okay hey
cat cat no he's behind the computer
okay yeah you you do it
chat why in chat if you would delete
them from your phone and in chat if no
no you can't be there i don't know if i
can take that h
up
oh my god so annoying man
uh yeah you can take it why not but i
got a busted heart
yeah yeah go for it don't take it as uh
yeah it'll just give you a spirit heart
if you think it
is that i guess here's my question if if
i die is bubble do i die as the other
character
yeah yeah okay gotta be careful
definitely yeah speed up
do what happened to my chaos card dude
where's my card
i don't think this is a sure-fire win
it really should be it should be you
just chill out
let the pilot this is this is a sully
situation right here
okay i'm gonna i'm gonna plop this into
the hudson
excuse me you're quiet now am i
homo made you quieter i'm getting upset
you are
gonna lose my mind you'll get out of the
office
you're nothing but trouble you'll get
jack we get some uh cat jam spam and
chat
that's why you don't see ruka that much
anymore he's always causing problems he
probably hit the freaking
okay hold on one sec hold on
this is new mike hudes
how about now you sound good to me chat
was just
chirping hello how how about now
saved hello john madden
john madden what is that
okay kill me okay all right that's
that's
what is that no that's that's cool guy
voice is
it's from our our rainbow six siege
sessions
that is disturbing it's just talking
while breathing in
john madden no thank you
no part of that if you think mine's bad
like
that's why i don't touch ouija boards
right there for whatever you're
whatever you're doing i want no part of
that john man
please sorry please sorry sorry
sorry i was very
honestly i i i mean here's the deal dude
i honestly feel like if
if we're talking about like a double dip
if you're at a restaurant like
in your you're that you shouldn't double
dip i'm just to be clear
with strangers or with acquaintances or
people you don't live with
but there is also a level for me of like
well why are you buying an appetizer
with a shared dip then
let's just pick a different appetizer if
we're gonna if we're gonna be policing
like this
so so you're basically saying
hey where'd my soul i didn't get i
didn't get my deborah's i think it's
because you picked it up as
uh as oh no they're right there never
mind
i'm gonna play as debbie um but here's
my thing though
like i'm okay like i think you're
in the gray area if you take a dip of
the chip
and then you rotate it so it's the
unbitten part i feel like that shows
some restraint
by you now the germs from your hand are
getting into the dip
i think i think you want to take the
black ruin here
okay do i pop it immediately no no check
check this out mmm see you never
get toasted oh streamer room
[Laughter]
okay and then yeah yeah oh magic skin
what
you have black rune right yeah yeah yeah
so
oh yeah yeah you should take dog tooth
okay by the way thank you for letting me
be the streamer oh dude no
this is just a normal day for me this is
the austin item
right it makes a noise when you move uh
when you go into another room yeah
i think you i think you should use um
the black rune on the other ones
what does that mean it sucks them up
okay nah you don't need to do that i
mean you can if you want i guess it's a
little spicy but
that's fun no you should use the black
rune on the
on the one i have right now nah you
should just press the button
yeah there you go oh i didn't know so
that sucks everything up
yeah yeah okay i didn't know that it it
transmutes
all of your items into statistical gains
you don't don't even worry about that
don't even touch that you're not ready
for that one yet
and kids aren't ready
dude when's he gonna make another back
of the future man
you mean like michael michael j fox yeah
probably never would be my if we can get
17 spider-mans we can get another back
to the future
they already made three of them it's
like it's two more than they should have
made to be honest
is huey lewis still alive i i definitely
believe that huey lewis is still alive
yeah
then they can make back to the future
for
because he you need him to do another
original scene
don't take money all right we're okay
look at that i'm just gonna you know
one of the more overrated movie
trilogies first
first movie classic second movie
it's fine mcfly those things don't work
on water et cetera et cetera
i think he took his wallet there's so
many
back to the future three yeah it should
be
actually terrible like oh dude
i'm with you on that two i like two
because it's the future
yeah one is classic three is like what
are those
bales of hay that have color in them
me yeah yeah go for it oh thanks
too kind it's good for hp
oh chip up
oh man okay um i'm
like in terms of the quality of like the
best movie in the franchise back to the
future is up there
in terms of the average quality of the
trilogy
it's no lord of the rings i can co-sign
that
and so you said lord of the rings you
you don't like lord of the rings
i don't need six movies
to tell two and a half books
and i'm the hobbit is my favorite
fiction book of all time
so but they made three back to the
future movies to cover no books
that's what i'm talking about they know
their audience
did you see that amazon spent like 500
million on a season of lord of the rings
it was it was for the game right it
wasn't for the show oh no
we had two different things yeah they
they also had the lord of the rings mmo
that they were making and then they just
canceled it why i don't know it probably
like it's
new world it's not very good i guess
but i mean for if they're spending 500
million on one season of a tv show let
me get that one
um i mean there better be
a personal frodo with every viewing
what does that even mean that means you
get your own personal frodo to watch it
with you
elijah would but but they spent the
money on you didn't spend the money on
it
i know but would you why would you get
your own personal photo if anything they
should just get like 500 million photos
but what can they what can they offer
you for 500 million in one season
like it is it's a ton don't get me wrong
we went flawless dude it's it's too easy
let's get in
you ever see this was the happy ending
yeah
look at that man you don't know about
the money what was your first reaction
to the ending
i tried to find it i couldn't find it
yeah you know i was just like i
just watched it and then was like huh i
can see why it would get people though
like
i was i was explaining to chat that i
think especially when you're a parent it
just hits different
like when you hear a child's innocent
voice going like
you know okay daddy i think it uh
i think it hits you right in the right
in the soft spot
i mean it's pretty emotional but i don't
know if it has the same kind of like
sentimental center as something like uh
black panther
or um one division
did you skip over the ending no you
skipped it
i mean i skipped the credits here i
didn't i didn't skip the
uh when i was playing it myself i didn't
skip it no
how am i shedding a tear at the ending
of isaac and you're skipping the ending
poking jokes at daddy and maggie
i think if you vibe hard enough the
feelings can't get you
[Laughter]
it's it's just like for me i think if it
if it was more narrative driven it could
have gotten me for sure
but instead like for 80 minutes i'm like
and then can you believe subway's
selling sandwiches as a side for another
sandwich it's ridiculous like
what do you know what i want when i
finish 12 inches of sandwich another
sandwich and then at the end it's like
okay daddy
and i'm like well i wasn't in the right
i wasn't primed for emotion i was
i was analytic you know there's a subway
commercial



the the grand tour okay um
i don't really it's a mess i don't
really know what's up with these i'm
pretty sure this is like
file one and two were where i originally
did
like a million and one percent but then
i uh
deleted them to try to do it again so
now file three is the one that i do
everything on for some reason
i don't know wait is is one of these
like i feel like one of these is like
the artifact it's like the thing that
indiana jones wants
which one of these can i just touch it
with my cursor probably
i mean three is the youtube and stream
one one is the original though i think
can you send me a little vibration when
i'm on one so i know
okay oh i felt okay i felt it i felt the
ones and zeros
all right all right so what do what do
you think oh don't look at that you're
not allowed to see that
you're not allowed hey close your eye
you're not allowed to see that stuff
oh i'm starting yeah i'm doing it i'm
doing it just flexing
you know what i'm a guest in your house
you whatever you feel
dude i love the the double eating idea
just to get like some
degree of randomness but also some
degree of uh
calm oh my god we start with the r
button shows what i know
okay double eden so eden is yeah right
there right
here compost oh
dude that's
that's the thing you're gonna wear if
you're worried about the the michael
douglas
treatment i'm not worried bob just you
know getting some
science-based activities right fellow
biological
individual brian gary oh how's your uh
how's your latency right now how's it
treating you i i've
i'm with you it's like just like uh if
we were speed running i'd be like
two frames behind if i know what you're
dealing with it feels amazing i was
hoping you know we got
that uh pacific northwest fiber optic
cable i thought maybe uh
it would be a little bit better but i
think it's just you know until they make
electricity faster we're just kind of
stuck with it
you have fiber oh come on
well i'm sorry some of us you know we
don't live in the future
but um for like six years we've had
fiber that fiber for six years
yeah dude is sick that's money dude
what's it like uh so like our old place
had fiber
um and it took about
four minutes to to ten minutes to upload
an isaac episode
four to ten then we moved into this
place and
you know how when you upload a video on
you or maybe you don't i guess but
you know when you upload a video on
youtube you gotta like click through the
check boxes and then it's like
hey there's like five minutes remaining
yeah for me it's like 35 but go ahead
i'm with you literally by the time i
finish the checklist it it's just like
it's up no yes it is are you kidding
it's incredible
hey uh go in here
yeah yeah yeah yeah do it do it so
that's crazy i do have to let you know
yeah every time you use the compost it
it turns all consumable items into
spiders and flies
okay why would we want that to happen
well you know like you
if you have a lot of spiders and flies
and you don't need
what is happening on the room consumable
wise you can use it but you probably
shouldn't just do it every time the bar
is full
you know what it looked like i thought
it was kick cancer like give me a little
bonus nice okay
it does look like the trinket a little
bit i could see that
wait so when did so when you went from
like cable to fiber were you just did
you feel like you were actually surfing
on ones and zeroes
it was like in the 1990s whenever the
like a magazine ad for the internet came
out
you could take that if you want it's not
it's not a what the oh right there's two
items oh okay
and it was like you know with with uh
net zero you can get speeds of up to
seven kilobits per second and then it
was always like a kid with wrap around
sunglasses on
surfing on like a green wave of ones and
zeros
it was it was like that i'm not gonna
lie oh
is it and it looks the same it's not
like a fiber pipe in your computer
i wish that they would be better i think
but on the other end of the line is it
like fiber
into the cat5 i honestly have no idea
it's just a
it's a jack that comes out of the wall
you should take that you'll you'll be
happier with that
yeah you'll be happier with that i'm
sure of it
dude we we actually have like a dream
run potential here
okay tell me why i have the r key have
you ever
seen the r key before i have not okay so
what this item does it's the same
there's an item in gungeon that does
almost the same thing it
restarts your run from the point at
which
you press the button so what we can do
is stack up like a ton of
items and then restart the run and then
we get to pick up even more items as if
the run had just started
like to square one yeah yeah but you
keep everything that you had up to that
point
eddie eddie shall we
three i remember it's gonna be three two
one go
and we're gonna go on the go cause i'm
gonna make it as fast as possible
three three can you move maybe down to
the wall
a little further okay i'll i'll take it
three two one go
hey okay we did it oh okay nice um i
don't want this
yeah that's gonna that's gonna hurt us
probably i don't know i don't know if
you can
i don't think you can hurt yourself but
you probably could hurt me i don't know
yeah that's fair so
okay so real quick about this michael
douglas stuff
yeah yeah when it came out was it like
big news
um that's how i heard of it like i
wasn't at the interview
yeah so it must have been must have been
relatively big news
you didn't you didn't hear about you you
i thought you watched uh access
hollywood
i knew he like he got uh cancer yeah
but my thing is is like i feel like
if that would have happened we would
have seen like the main headline and
then 10 or 12
like ancillary headlines diving deeper
into the michael douglas theory jimmy
fallon like hey did you see what this
guy said on access hollywood
yeah yeah no i i don't know i mean it
was a long time ago
yeah i think you should take the spirit
hard yeah then you know what i'm gonna
spy this see how it looks oh
i hope it heals both of us but i don't
know so here's
you know what hold on pop this down
oh what the the balloons
and then do you believe
i believe you can tap that
tap it epihendra
i should have done it while i had the
chance you know what whatever
oh let let me take him though cause i'm
i'm on low hp oh no i'm gonna die
i'm gonna no you have me alright let me
take that one
all right all right um so dude you won
twitch rivals
i i finally got a twitch rivals win it's
true
all it was was a game where i think i
had the most play time out of any of the
contestants and also i got to pick the
contestants
well here's my thing like normally on
their subreddit there's like always like
a recap
you know like the pldw there was no
recap for the
for twitch rivals or for the stream in
general for the
like just for like hey i wanted to know
what happened and i couldn't find any
intel
um i think it went up it's all automated
now
like there there's a bot that if i'm on
live for like more than
five minutes it automatically posts the
thread or something
no i mean like i wanted someone's recap
like oh
yeah dude honestly like activity on the
uh
on the subreddit is at like an all-time
low so i think it's
yeah i think so most of the people are
like they're popping in and they're just
going like
you know it's repentance and i had a
good time watching but what is there to
talk about you know
so all right so well let's this is a
tough boss so let me
radio silence sure sure
well for me radio science i know you
normally hey
you know what's the deal with avocados
next to the peaches
i was i was talking about yesterday oh
did you know the subway in canada they
just released a new side
okay you know what it is what smaller
sandwiches
the side so you can get a sandwich
alongside of your your sandwich
fair trade fair trade okay okay
um so i have saruman is
explain to me what that is i have no
idea actually
okay what about uh bilbo's knife um
it used to do nothing and now it does
something
okay i think you could take
the eye of saruman i prefer
well i can't if i don't have the hp to
take it so
if i die and you reset do i come back
no but you're not gonna die when you get
this i know but
i'm gonna die after i get hit with
debate
i think i think you can do it okay
oculus rift
and then i'm just let's go down to the
next floor
see how like see if we have any curses
poke around a little bit yeah because
i'm like i see you're you got a problem
there
with your hp which is fair
but hear me out if you get don't don't
walk into the shots
if you get hit i'll just hit the r
button
and then we'll restart yeah we won't
have anything to worry about there
but try not to get hit because oh yeah
because we keep uh
every item that we get so just being
able to get to like one more item room
would be like a huge win
is the r button a one-use marty yeah you
can only use it one time
um but like this is the item i used i
think it was
i can't remember what character i was i
might have even been the keeper but it's
how i beat alt path as the keeper you're
all right you're all right
we're gonna we're gonna get you out of
this don't sometimes
it's there's like a black hole shot it's
sucked up
your your shot is a black hole and it
sucked up my ex placebo
okay okay so go go pick that up
oh thank you thank you
might as well might as well check it
okay nothing wrong i need some
coloration man
sometimes i get a little confused who's
who oh i see okay so this is really
tough because we
uh like the water is pushing us down but
i think we should still just do it the
the old-fashioned way
okay three two
one go
i i held back i held back because i
thought i was going to beat you there
hey um
i was trying to be a teammate i
understand uh but that's you know you
gotta you just gotta trust oh
trust the system yeah okay i i
still think we should try to want to go
want to go item room or no
uh this literally i mean
go to the shop um we could i don't want
you to buy a spirit heart because i i
want to save our money to buy something
that we can use permanently
when we hold our if we have to we can
but oh no i'm good i won't get hit
forehead
yeah you can even just like hang back
for a for a bit here
i've gotten some pretty decent items i'm
not sweating it
dude this
[Laughter]
dude your black hole shots are really
good though
you just don't know what's going to come
out from what direction
okay nice and easy nice and easy oh yeah
stay at it stay out of the cloud stay
out of the closet yeah yeah yeah
yeah okay now this is where things might
get a little touchy
okay yeah this guy's like insanely
annoying
[Laughter]
all right um there's no way for me to
come back
or is there i can't i thought it could
steal a heart yeah can't you press start
and take my hp or something
nothing no beat the boss chat saying
he comes back after the boss okay all
right fair enough
we can do it here i mean it's still the
same run you know it's uh that guy's
tough man
now i'm not gonna say that he's not
tough
but he did do one attack where he shot a
bomb and you just stood next to it
until it exploded well which i think
probably
was not the right way to handle it at
the same time
you know you blame your teammate or you
say hey look
what maybe it depends on what my
teammate did i guess
not blaming my teammate because i think
we're still going to win
but may my teammate maybe they hit an
advanced stats penalty
as a result of uh their own actions um
so here's what we're going to do here
i'm going to walk out so you don't get
sucked into that thing
as soon as you move and uh i think you
should grab
and i think you should grab again try to
get some hp hey
okay okay okay okay we're in this now
we're in this we're back we're back
refresh run so you technically you could
take this thing all the way you
and then hit that r button if you wanted
to well yeah
not anymore because the r button's gone
but yeah it's pretty much what i did i
think i took it all the way to like
the mom fight and then went back to zero
and i was like
so strong by the time i got there like
it was it was crazy so dude twitch rival
so give me like the the
tl dr format okay so with pummel party
yeah it was pummel party and uh we
played two
pretty long games they were like an hour
long each so pummeled
just like it's just mario party
basically it's like
it's indie mario party i'll just try
that
okay um and they actually like have
added
um like every time i play it it's been
out for a couple years
they add more games every single time
like it's it's actually crazy
like when we first put i have a knife
where did that come from
um oh it's 404
404 maybe my my trinket gave me mom's
knife for a room
wow that's really good
anyway it's it's basically just mario
party but indy
and uh so it was basically like at the
end of every
round you play a mini game whoever wins
the most mini games you know you you get
keys you use the keys to buy goblets the
winner is the person at the end of the
game who has the most
goblets and is it like eight v8 or what
is it yeah well one v one v one for
eight people so it's like
it's a free for all with eight people
okay and uh
yeah i i won the first game
and it's funny just like mario party
like the the people
who do the best don't always end up
winning because there's like collusion
and stuff or like yeah
like random random chants and stuff like
that
random giveaways and don't don't leave
i'll leave you
um yeah just basically i got really
lucky is what it came down to and then
in the second game
i they didn't really collude to stop me
so i think i came in third but a first
and a third
in you know an eight person uh event
it's pretty uh
it's pretty good i think you should take
that you get close to enemies first and
third
yeah so first how did you get
um i mean i i did pretty well
i i performed i would say a little bit
above average and
and got uh a pretty good performance a
third is good like
in an eight bucks third i got
i got third in my second game
three two three two one
go hey there you go there you go tomato
boy
wait so i so you're talking about two
twitch rivals i thought you said you got
first
there were two matches played
to determine this twitch rivals there
was one
one match and then there was a ten
minute break and then there was another
match
so is the twitch rivals done yes it's
the final
the final placements yeah um on the
olympic podium yeah it was done on
friday
okay where were you standing on the
olympic podium
first i won the twitch rivals okay then
why did you say third
because in the first game i came first
and then in the second game i came
third but you got first overall right
that's correct yeah yeah
that's that's what that's what i'm
talking about you know what it
it you know in soccer um when they go to
like the champions league they play two
matches
and then you'd be like oh how do they
determine who wins in two matches
well it's based on like the score from
both games and then whoever had the
highest score
moves on right right like that's
that's what happened here as well there
were two
games okay you're gonna take euthanasia
um
oh sorry we don't want that that's
that's garbage
there were two games in aggregate and
first and third was the best result out
of all eight players
i understand but when you watch the jake
paul fight you didn't say hey
how many points did ben askren no like
no jake paul
won the fight but i was just asking who
won the fight if it had gone
to uh the judges then it's possible that
there would have been a situation where
jake paul was like hey i won
eight of the 12 rounds and then you'd be
like what i thought you won like the
whole fight
though and he'd be like i did and then
be like but you lost four rounds
but i asked you i go what place did you
get you got third and you said third and
first
i won the twitch rivals in the two
rounds i got first and third
yo give him a couple shots see if he
spits out something you like couple
shots of love with tila tequila
oh okay there's hp out here well yeah it
kind of
uh oh no you should take you should take
oh you take no you take
yeah yeah go back and sack okay but only
only play him
one time what do you say one time do you
mean one time or one heart
i meant one time thank oh yeah i think
we should leave
please sir i want some more you're gonna
you're gonna have to give him at least
two if you want more
we're gonna be in a bad spot okay i
don't want to be okay
okay let's move on then
i don't think he was ready for it well
that dude oh congratulations on you
thank you yeah
all right next time i guess i when you
say give me the play-by-play instead of
giving you the play-by-play i'll just
be like no i won
[Laughter]
yeah which is good man so and then you
guys won
uh money for charity yeah yeah so we got
to pick the charity that we were playing
for and i uh i picked doctors without
borders
and uh i think the first prize was like
3 500 bucks so it's
that's awesome pretty substantial and uh
exciting for sure that's kind of like my
uh
the program i use to move my mouse
between two independent computers called
mouse without borders
it is it's honestly i was thinking of
you when uh when i chose it
you know i thought you were gonna say
it's like um how you have like you know
folding at home or something like that
like you know
you ever have protein at home or a suit
when i was a biology teacher in high
school i would give uh
kids extra credit if they turn their
ps3s on with folding at home
really yeah that's cool considering the
science on my
uh on my phone they were like hey do you
want to turn on this thing where like
when uh your lock screen is up it'll
play advertisements and then it'll
donate the money from advertisements to
charity
and while your lock screen is up yeah
yeah yeah who cares
so i that was i mean i turned it on
because i was like this literally like
the most frictionless
yeah you can get on the right side on
this one we'll try it that's just
it's three
two one go that was so
smooth yeah you got a great rate of fire
now too
oh dude we got a planetarium on this
floor
that's that's great news but um
the other thing i was thinking i thought
two things after that one is we know
advertising rates so i'm pretty sure
that that's not a colossal amount of
money
what is this what is this
just pick it up i don't even know what
it does just just just pick it up let's
see what happens what is this
it looks like that uh juicy fruit gum
uranus uranus dude you've got
ice tears now that's really good oh we
we gotta check for this wait is that new
do you have to unlock that or something
uh i i think you do
yeah but i don't remember how you how
you unlock it okay
and then the other thing i was thinking
is like who are the advertisers that are
like yeah run
my ads on the lock screen when obviously
nobody's paying attention to their phone
at all but
it's for a good cause well it's kind of
like i don't know if you ever bought a
like amazon fire tablet uh i never
bought one but
i do i do have uh about nine of them
well for us normies if you have to buy
one
you have the option to buy it like
without ads
or without really for like 15 bucks
cheaper
that and it plays the ads on your lock
lockscreen go ahead and take the
euthanasia yeah i should take this one
for sure
i usually take the other one yeah yeah
no problem there why was chad surprised
that i was a biology teacher i don't
understand that
um moving on
[Laughter]
oh where did he come from uh okay so i i
guess we got some plays here
first play i'll take that yeah yeah
so we're gonna meet it i want me to walk
uh yeah
you should walk it out i think okay and
then we should get the key piece man we
might be able to do alt path on this one
okay you gotta really like i think
that's one of the best
uh planetarium items that seems amazing
you know what it looked like it looked
like that gum that's like
juicy fruit i don't know if you ever had
it as a kid but it was like
candy striped you ever have that gum you
had to have had at least once in your
life striped
like you're talking about like ice
breakers mints
no you know like old-school juicy fruit
comes in the yellow package you know
what yeah yeah
so it's like that exact same shape i
need to do i need to burn or no
no no no i think you can just i'll go
through and you should just come with me
uh but i wanted to keep you not the lost
because you got some hp we can leverage
if we need to oh
okay um but anyway so it's like juicy
fruit but it was look
like the gum design was like peppermint
but instead of peppermint it was like
fruit colored
people are saying zebra is that fruit
oh fruit stripe is what it's called
there was like a cool commercial for it
too not in 90s anyways
that's what that that room looked like
it yeah i don't think we had that in uh
in canada i think we're we're just stuck
with juicy fruit
double mint and whatever the the hot one
is
the cinnamon flavor oh dude what was
that
called not dentine but big red
big red that's right if you don't chew
big red fu
now i remember yeah
dude i was thinking i've talked about
this a few times
i don't think i know anybody on earth
that chews gum anymore
but i don't know if it's that i just
aged out of the gum demographics or if
like the uh
if the market for gum is just cratered
or something like i don't know yeah i
was thinking the same thing i was
thinking when you're talking about big
red
like that was a big move in high school
like you would ask people for gum
and if you like someone asked you like
okay you got any gum
they're like no i'm like well i got some
you want
yeah mouth i used to probably take a a
stick of gum from mouth well actually it
was a tablet because it was dentine
ice but i used to take a a tablet of gum
from mouth probably like three times a
week
yeah and that like forged your
friendship yeah yeah yeah
you know elf's got the gum take a take a
piece leave a piece
now i don't remember the last time i uh
i left a piece
to be honest but you know see wait go
back go back go back
that's this is what the gum looked like
exactly like this
i mean it looks tasty right like it
looks meaty and and delicious
i got i got no problems with that but
yeah
i'll i don't know please well i was just
gonna just put a cap on it i was like i
always see
gum when you check out at the grocery
store and like
they're all full like the display has
not been touched
i'm trying to think like i have altoids
right in my car and i
maybe have some tic tacs from time to
time but no gum
oh okay oh don't don't go down okay
because we can we can do all patches oh
yeah
yeah yeah yeah we need one more daddy oh
you got him
um i'm trying to think when's the last
time you bought gum
probably it's within a decade but it
might be close to the tail end of the
decade
come to think about i mean now it's hard
to see people's mouths but
if you don't see people going anymore
dude you know what honestly i'm trying
to i think if i
chewed gum my bluetooth earbud would
fall out
way more often i feel like it would just
it would migrate the earbud out of my
ear
you can do it yeah yeah yeah yeah do you
what the heck do you uh
do you use airpods or what do you use i
have galaxy buds
dude they're really good actually no
tell me
it's it's april 20th without telling me
it's april 20th my man's talking about
galaxy buds
dude galaxy buzzer they're good
okay i don't even want the teleport
actually you know what
i think i should try to grab the
teleport it's probably better than dull
razor
yay but just believe a hundred percent
okay
three two one go
hey data miners terrible though i don't
think you want that yeah
um yeah so they're they're pretty cool
they also have a setting on them called
ambient noise
and then i was like oh that's cool they
like create white noise
but they it's not what they do they
actually have microphones
built into the earbud uh so that like
you can wear them while you're walking
and even though you're listening to like
a podcast or something
it will amplify the sound in your
environment
so that you can still be aware of like
you know cars and
you know honking and stuff like that and
like birds
quick question doesn't that defeat the
purpose of earbuds because you don't
want to talk or converse with any humans
well you know when i'm walking the baby
i like to have them on
so that uh i can listen to something
but also still you know know if a car is
gonna hop the curb
and crash into me i think you could also
use it as like a spy tool
but i will say the first time the first
time i turned it on i was like
like beautiful white noise and then i
touched the earbud and it was like
and i was like this is horrible man okay
what dude we you can't reroll your run's
too good
okay but i can read what does one do it
re-rolls your entire run
okay but even my run is pretty good
honestly but
i'm gonna do it anyway what the heck
oh no we got your favorite item bbf
but we also how are your tears dude
you're looking good oh that this seems
pretty solid look at that
and then hey would you look at that i
got so much hp
you take that and then we'll buy i was
going to say we'll buy
a spirit heart in here but look at mama
oh please how do we get her hey we can't
get mama oh we have restock okay check
this out
um you take that to protect your eternal
heart
and then i'll take this and then
oh and then we got these bombs that's
pretty sweet you
you don't have a trinket or you um
oh you got infinite range dude a
matchbook is better i think
you think so i think i think probably or
maybe
um you get more bombs okay
um can i tell you something about isaac
okay yeah so i've been playing games due
for i don't know we were talking earlier
like a long time
yeah yeah since 2013. i don't think i
ever played a game where you're more
dialed and more into the w than this
game
like dude i i lose a lot in repentance
like it's a hard game
and then everybody makes fun of me
they're like oh three thousand hours
three thousand hours
so like i've really got a a combination
of banter but then also like bringing my
a game is
is very important to me
also it's like the game where
backseating tilts me more than any other
game in
earth's history because the people
backseating
are not always because there are there
have been some helpful comments
but you know they they sometimes will
say things like hey did you know like if
you pick up red hearts it it
gives you more hp it fills up the empty
red heart containers that you have
and then you're like yeah i know and
they're like oh sorry i was just trying
to help
i don't understand why you get so
annoyed i was just
i was selflessly choosing to help you
not to feed my own ego or anything like
that but just because i wanted to make
sure you had the best chance to win
possible and now you're upset
like it's just it's madness so i gotta
i gotta bring my a game always to to
prove that i'm uh
still the the big cheese you know i
could understand you the pressure you're
under
you know to perform hey randy moss did
you know like if you catch the football
like that counts as a reception
okay hold on we this is this is amazing
dude we could get mama mega
yes please can we okay so like
i've never seen those before oh yeah
those are those are corn rocks
doesn't really matter who gets this um
trip joker dude that actually is pretty
sick two of clubs two of diamonds is
really good
ace of clubs okay so i'm going to two of
clubs
give me the sun card and i'll i'll pop
it because my hp is so low thank you
could have popped it next floor but it's
okay hey it's bright now
let's go okay and then um
you have two doubles okay okay so here
here's how we do this i'll take this
because my my rate of fire is a little
lower than yours
um excuse me can you please
illuminate the or not that's fine um
hold on we got some other stuff left to
do on this floor you still have two of
diamonds right
uh no oh yeah i do i do okay okay
this is this runs looking real nice okay
it's got real potential have you ever
done like the full alt path i think you
have right
uh i've if the full alt is beating
medusa icarus fights medusa's warriors
then yes
that sounds right okay that sounds
correct yeah
have you ever beaten kid icarus oh could
you could you leave the room yes
i can i know i know what the tick does i
know enough about flash isaac not to
touch that thing
okay can i buy her can i buy her i think
you should buy it
yeah don't use it though just buy it
oh it's not a it's not a catch-all yeah
you can what do you want to
do you can only use it on one floor it
uses like an insane mega bomb on every
uh
on every room it's it's
worth it i think yeah it's a one-time
martial yeah
though so don't use it but now
pick up oh pick up book of sin for a
second
city to the bookie yeah and now you were
getting closer to bookworm yeah we
should have used two of diamonds but
that's okay
um i would pop it anyway just pop two of
diamonds
okay that's r1 oh no
he's oh he's done it look at that i'll
get night light as well
pay-to-play is not that good though
i think we'll just bomb through this
i can't wait to drop her
[Laughter]
i don't think there's a good reason to
save it once we get to the next floor
oh you know what let's like i think you
might as well use it so that you have uh
the space for a space bar item in the
future
but not not yet ah let's just let's do
it
probably one of one of the worst deals
in history
no i i don't want to get hit i don't
want to get hit don't worry i got you i
got you
once this guy's toasted okay you ready
for this
what what the heck's going on there we
go oh my
oh nice nice nice nice little conversion
okay okay all right i'm just gonna i'm
not gonna touch anything just
bring us home and i think uh i'm trying
to think this is only ash pit one okay
so we gotta get the key piece on the
next floor and then we're we're good to
go
okay
yeah you can use the ace card on enemies
now it's pretty good
yeah we should be good to go huh yeah
yeah yeah good and then
just cover your eyes you can pop it
immediately
right now sand it what hat okay
okay then check this out dude okay
yo start playing the ink spots i don't
want to set the world on fire yo
can you turn that timer off oh sorry
yeah
yeah you know i i people uh they're
always like how do you play with that
stuff on the screen
and i'm like what stuff
[Laughter]
yes okay good good good so we got a good
shot here
oh did you ever did you ever play kid
icarus as a kid did you ever beat it no
i only played it when we played it for
the golden goblet and i was like this
game's a basic garbage
i thought i thought it was not
particularly uh
particularly good let's go to the course
room real quick
so the ending of this game is
that's what happens in kid icarus is
oh the game is just and you go to float
mode against uber enemies that's not
like any other part of the game so i
think eddie owes
everything all the isaac's success the
kid icarus
yeah just oh no it's already hit it's
already good
okay well you know at least there's some
merit to the game then
because uh when we played it for the
golden goblet i'm just gonna say i
wasn't that impressed
they they knocked it out of the park on
the music and then everything else
not so much i think it's one of those
games where it's like if you played it
it's nostalgia and if you missed it it's
garbage you know what i mean
yeah like you can't go back in and like
re-appreciate it
right well i can you can't
[Laughter]
dude that was good you got damage on
that one nice picture that's like you
going back and playing halo like you
think it's amazing and i think it's like
uh
you don't like halo bro i was playing
fps
on the computer halo was like kids games
yeah but halo
it was the first game where you could
actually um aim up and down instead of
just side to side
so old denied yeah gold and i oh you
want to aim up and down
very simple just hold the r button and
then use the d-pad to adjust your
crosshair
while also moving okay you
what's your trick it's matchbook right
yes
you can definitely smell it yeah
and then i'm like i don't know maybe
we'll give it a try we got some money oh
that's really good
go ahead and take it you're lower on hp
okay and i mean that's really good
you should take that honestly is there a
candle deal
um like can you become a candle if i get
the third candle i
i don't believe so but it's uh it's an
interesting idea for sure
but i mean in like it was probably early
high school for me that gold night came
out and everyone's like oh my gosh this
is amazing
bro you ever played wolfenstein about a
decade ago
yeah but uh excuse me in wolfenstein you
don't get to
drive inside of a warthog and you can
either drive
or be in the turret seat or just ride
shotgun and
control the aux cable yeah but i'm
talking about
um the thing about goldeneye that was
resin before resin existed how could
they have a hitbox that's
infinitesimals smaller than everyone
else don't you think that looks like
poor design choices odd job yeah yeah
it doesn't really matter how we divide
this one i think i think you know what
you you take the question mark because i
know you like it this is not a good item
right it's okay
i don't mind it but yeah it doesn't
matter either way yeah three all right
two one go oh
we can get bookworm i think or you can
get bookworm maybe
maybe we got bookworm i appear not
to say unicorn you would have got it
first because it was your third book
right
i would have thought so but
didn't monster manuel used to not be
good uh it's still pretty bad
but now you get to keep your familiar
for the whole floor instead of just the
room
okay oh i rerolled my whole run that
makes sense
anyway but i should have got it i
thought so too
okay we're we're all right let's let's
do this first
d-a-e bookworm only gives it to the
first person to pick it up
apparently that's that's the new truth
okay okay
um i'm i'm thinking we should do this
first
just so we don't forget when things
become a little bit more
and we both have to do it right uh we
both have to go
on it do we miss one we must have
never mind oh i don't know this might
make it even easier
yo mommy versus mommy mommy wins
look at that yo i mean if this
if this works this is good technology
see what if eddie planned for this
okay i got a
it could oh let's just see you later oh
no
oh no it's it's so good
never mind it seems oh just about the
same
me or you you sound good yeah yeah yeah
you knew that was coming i was like why
did why did he pick it up

said hey man can
he was eating his builder's bar and i
was like hey man can i have some of that
i'm really hungry
what's he eating a builder's bar for he

just
freaking threw it in the woods
just just to be a jerk did he punch you
no but he was like you know come on
like why why would you do that and in
hindsight i don't know but in the moment
it was kind of hilarious
you're one of those guys aren't you i'll
i'd just do anything for a laugh you

lately man i know you've been you've
been cooking it up

when she's post like meals you're
cooking she's like ryan made this

cooking the hello fresh
but dude the hello fresh i mean this is
like real me
energy the hello french is starting to
piss me off a little bit
why because in the last one like so
there's been times in the past they've
been like hey check it out you know for
being a hello fresh customer here's like
a free
little hot sauce bottle or something
like that is hello fresh the same thing
as blue apron
yeah yeah yeah okay okay dude let me
take the bones no you take the bones
because it's you got frozen tears
frozen bones uh so i'm a little bit
faster than you
so i'm gonna go on half a second after
i think i do but i think that ah
whatever
three okay two one go
that was pretty secret that was
synchronicity um
okay now you you got a real issue there
on your side because of your hp
but we're gonna get you out of it don't
even sweat it so here's what you're
gonna do
okay i'm a fool give me a second here
i got i got grand plans for you sir
you're gonna love this i promise you
okay trust i trust i think
no no no no no no no no no
you're not gonna believe this walk into
the spike one time
you're talking about the big bang the
luda car
simon's quest do it do it okay
do it again stop it
when does the science pay off here do it
one more time
and then we're going to take you back
that gave you a very nice like 30
uh tears up
and then you buy phd and you'll get your
hp back
i feel like you just took my builder's
bar and eated it into the woods
dude that was that was great value
that was an incredible uh return on
investment there
why in chad that was good value
they don't know what they're talking
about it's like asking you know people
on the street you know is climate change
real they don't have the expertise
necessary to deal with this kind of
information okay
you just you look at the pilot or the
airplane you recognize he's got your
best interest in mind
okay i'll trust you so we've been doing
this this blue apron
uh stuff for a long time they they
include free samples
uh sometimes apron or hello fresh hello
fresh yeah
just did you ever do blue apron uh no we
didn't get it it didn't exist in canada
until recently i think so
um anyway may i proceed
yes okay so we have uh hellofresh
and they used to give us a bunch of free
samples which was cool you know
like it's marketing but it's marketing
that you can feel okay about
yeah because you're like i got something
for free and maybe i'll buy nando's
extra hot piri piri sauce next time i'm
at the grocery store
this time i open up the box yesterday
there was an envelope in it that said
from us to you thanks for being a hello
fresh customer
oh okay i got very excited right like
what's going on in here
i open up the envelope it's absolutely
stuffed with paper
like just overflowing like ripping the
seam on the envelope
that was so excited literally
12 pieces of junk mail well hold on
let's give them some credit what's junk
mail hey we're having a sale at
uh like the eyeglass store if you want
to pick up some new glasses
you know that they're ten percent off
for the time being you know
hey uh but if you buy edible
arrangements
and you bring this coupon and we'll
throw in like an extra strawberry for
free
and you're i'm like i actually was gonna
tweet them
like take a photo of it and be like hey
excuse me like we pay you
you know 13 bucks a meal for 250 worth
of ingredients uh
why are you also giving us this
advertisement
like it's it's insulting
basically it's direct mail marketing
garbage
well here's ooh balls of steel that's
something here's my thing
yeah if they didn't say a gift for you i
don't think you're mad
and like if they didn't put sauce on it
you know what i mean i
completely understand they did sauce it
up as if it was like oh you're gonna
love this yeah
and then i didn't for the record
yeah i could see that it's just i mean
it's annoying right like
did you keep any of the coupons no we
tossed them all
sure there wasn't any value in there i
read them all they're all bad
they were genuinely all terrible oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah take a ticket go ahead take it
take it uh you should take it
why not you should take that
um i
i i think who's who's this best friend
with
oh frick i was trying to figure out who
could get conjoined but
uh you know my bad um
okay we're on it yo let's go no no no
let's go play the let's go play the
eddie room
okay and bye bye oh no no you're you're
insane absolutely not
i'm not going
i thought the eddie room was the demon
judgment that's no problem
the sacrifice room is is look it can pay
out don't get me wrong you can also you
know like spend your life savings on the
powerball and win
both i mean understand godhead 50 of the
time is pretty good odds
you just got to trust the pilot man also
speaking of which the pilots got a
little bit of a bone to pick
um on the last fight um
my advice is don't stand inside of the
enemy bullets
for as long i i watched you get hit by
the same bullet like
four times why are you watching me
instead of watching yourself
oh i needed something to do to distract
myself from the the boredom of fighting
that boss for the 2010.
well you didn't let it distract you from
leaving that angel item behind
that's true and you know be the head as
you may
you you could take it it's it's really
bad for me
dude honestly i think it's kind of good
for you i have no guppies i'm not i
won't die
yeah but i think it'll give you nine
lives at no cost i don't think it'll
take your bone hearts
oh you don't think it will i don't think
so i think you i think you're good to
take it
look at that oh trust the pilot trust
the i'm telling you man i wouldn't
look the pilot's gonna make mistakes but
here's the thing unless you're also a
pilot you don't know the mistakes
yeah but as a pilot he can't make
a major mistake correct yeah guardian
angel though that's not a major mistake
most as soon as we pick that up people
would have forgotten it existed
there's like three items we have that
matter on this run
[Laughter]
ice tears is really good i've got like
great stats
blue candles pretty good you know that's
valuable stuff there for sure but
there's a lot of items here that that
you know if you lost them
people wouldn't even notice
what is that gold golden teleporter kind
of stinks
at this point i think you just walk into
the bottom one
just go for it i'm not worried about the
top oh that's really good
ghost hat you know host tent no
you have explosion immunity dude i
cannot believe you ranked every isaac
item
how long could that took five hours
did you do it straight through yeah
it was pretty annoying honestly
now you gotta do it again i'm never
going to do it again
things have changed please can we get
that quoted please
maybe one million subscribers special
we'd consider doing it again but
definitely not just to have an updated
list this is a weird one
um i'm gonna take it because it gives me
protection for my eternal heart at least
but i should go to the shop i think okay
yeah one million twitch subs
then then for sure for sure we'll do it
um i think it's pretty doo doo
unfortunately okay hey i'm with you
earlier today i was talking about
how we're listening this insane in the
rain music song and it sounded like
have you ever been into a like
we ever been to the uh fair and they
have
they have different tents like a polish
ten an italian tent
i i have not no oh
so that's like sounds very foreign to
you it sounds very american
so like in the polish tent they have
polka music and they got like
mom's pierogies that kind of stuff i
mean i so
they do a fireworks festival in
vancouver every year except for
last year for obvious reasons um and
they usually have like different
food trucks set up that are like hey
like for today
oh no sorry i'm remembering now how it
actually works
um hold on we should we should grab
these and then i'll continue but
three two one go that was just
and then then let's do it again uh yeah
you can take the hp i think it's good
three you don't know you don't know bob
bob
i'll tell you off stream you know you
don't want to deal with it on stream but
three
two one go that dude that's so
in sync but like so the fireworks
festival
is actually like uh it's a competition
so these like
fireworks companies from countries come
and
uh then there's food trucks based on the
countries that were there
okay so we went to one of the days last
year and i uh
i had some croatian food so i guess
that's kind of similar
but then like you expect that they're
gonna be like during the fireworks
they're gonna play like croatian music
nah man
yeah just gangnam style and my heart
will go on
every every country
[Laughter]
every country play in the same the same
repertoire pretty much every year
hold on before you go on i want to turn
the music up a little bit okay on my
steam
hold on
speaking of dude this morning i put on
oh we're not there yet uh my spotify
playlist the songs that i've liked
okay and um a bunch of bangers came out
i wanted to do so
you talked about being in sync that's
what made me think of it okay so you're
tearing up my heart by instinct
that popped up but also a song by bush
and i'm like
we've never talked about bush i wonder
i'm like i wonder
we talked about uh michael douglas so we
kind of covered it
bush just don't think about it
um no
um i i only know one song by bush i
think
it's speed kills coming up mountains
speed that's not even a popular song i
know someone
like in in middle school was like you
gotta hear this
and then like on cops don't listen
on on microsoft msn messenger they
transferred the
the wmv file to me for wma
so that that's how i know it i need a
red heart let's go back
can i get the lasagna heart line you go
yeah yeah it's only
move move move i mean like
i didn't see the bomb you did say move
move
move i did say move move move if i place
the bomb you have bomb immunity so it's
not that big of a deal but still
it's just you know
so glycerin you've never heard how does
that one how does how does glycerin go
because i know it's their most popular
breathe
go ahead and pick that up um oh you're
actually full okay yeah
because the the rotten hearts they only
count as a half so it's hard to tell
sometimes
oh that isn't glycerin that's machine
head all right well
i know i know machine head then
you're about that life you're not about
that life i mean
okay so speed kills i thought it was
like it's you know an okay song and i
got some eighth grade nostalgia for it
um apparently the song known as machine
head
never felt strongly about it either way
but i have a lot of nostalgia for those
like
the songs you'd hear on 90s alt rock
radio yeah
so i i would put it in the plus category
i suppose
gotcha plus he did marry gwen stefani
so like obviously
it's a man of uh of a certain degree of
good taste
and gwen what dude i'll tell you what
there's a trend going on tick tock right
now of
90s old rock stars
lampooning themselves really yeah like
gwen so i saw the guy from creed
on there really like lamprooning himself
the the dude hello my name is and then
gwen stefani
that's she's like oh gwen stefani
dressed up in her mouth shirt and was
like this song came out 25 years ago and
she dressed in the same outfit
you know the gwen stefani mouth shirt i
think i know what you're talking the guy
i'm just a girl
yeah i'm so freak what
what is the dude hello my name is
hello my name is is it is it oh blink
one
goes he like he was talking normal and
then the
middle of it goes come on that's right
he like used this fake voice
you know what i mean yeah yeah no i hear
you
cindy all right
oh you went right in there you gave me
no reason to fight it
i feel like sometimes i don't go this
path
well no no that's fair because you
wouldn't go this path unless you were uh
going the full alt path but i feel like
i've fought in dogma without doing this
can you not do that you don't have to
fight this boss necessarily
there's other bosses from this uh from
this path
let me get this can i have the h up
absolutely yeah thank you
go ahead take the other one why not
lock up oh you so yeah
this is not the path to dogma either
that's that's my level of confusion
um so there's two alt pass dogma and
then uber mom
sure yeah yeah i call him alt path and
and true ending
um okay let me get on your vernacular
but then i i always mislabel them when
we're in the run as well
okay you you should use the emperor card
and let's just let's do it man
don't don't forget to use uh blue candle
as much as possible because it'll break
the
shots okay here we go
dude this is a real chance i don't know
if i've done this as this character by
the way so we might get like a post-it
note that i've
i haven't unlocked yet oh dude the black
hole is so good here black hole
sun there you go yeah bush i used to
listen to that song on repeat while
playing zelda two
over and over and over and over it's a
good song
yeah i don't think anyone oh we're both
stupid how about that i don't think
anybody would say that that's a bad song
uh my first cd was the garth
brooks album in pieces
because my favorite song as a little kid
was standing outside the fire by garth
brooks
how does that song go that life is not
tried it is merely
survived when you're standing outside
the fire
and it was like i remember the album
cover so well because it's called
in pieces and then it's like garth
brooks but his face is on a checkerboard
it's it's like the cheesiest album cover
you could ever imagine
i'm getting bodied where do i stand
daddy okay do a quarter circle oh
i'm never mind he's targeting you man
that was a
oh no
here let me uh shoot
i want to die nine times
you know what i mean bomb me bomb me
bomb me you just walk into those
okay i think i'm gonna lose honestly
like
i don't think i could i don't think i
could win against uh
against the boss like this you you had a
lot of the damage potential there
i am i would never ever point the finger
but let
the jury be known that i did not want to
take
happy cat let the let the jury
uh know as well i didn't expect dan to
get hit
14 times in 50 seconds on the uh
on the run dude i'm trusting the pilot
don't don't lose your last life
so you're still good you can still you
can still die
also in case i don't come back you guys
don't come back oh that's a good idea
that's good thank you don't come
okay how many more uh it's unknown
at present but
move around for a sec okay this is your
last life
how do you know that cause you got no
you got no guppy head following you
anymore
okay because now you can i don't know
you might have been in there anyway but
at least we got some like black hole
shots here we got some ice shots
look at that watch yourself
okay there you go either way i'm happy
to have the extra damage you got there
oh there's
we're done we're toasted
this is like this is impossible man oh
you got it
it's it this guy can't be dodged dude
instead it can't be done
that's a good run it was you know i'm
glad i didn't get the posted note uh
completed that would have been
embarrassing
[Laughter]
what would have been embarrassing well
then i would be like what the heck
happened i uh
how where did i get this good run
really seven nine millie six willy
really



okay new character um that's probably
the last time we'll ever do a tainted
cane run
on twitch is my expectation let's let's
keep the
the bad vibes flowing and let's try to
do a uh
let's try to do a jacob and esau run we
have so much left to do
i mean to make boss rush will be
something here man give it a try
bad vibes only
at least get the first item room it
feels nice to actually have some damage
for the first time in a long time
like in terms of tainted characters i
love the idea of tainted kane which is
why like i play as him
too often um
it's kind of the same situation as uh
as tainted jacob but uh after playing
through
the uh you know maybe like four runs on
on twitch i'm like i kind of actually
don't like them
definitely farnikis hello again and
thank you for the the gifted
subscriptions thank you
like it's it's the worst part of um
minecraft streaming combined with uh
isaac to begin with i think you just i
gotta accept that it's my own
stubbornness and i gotta
you know look up the recipes and then
just like uh
you know steamroll the runs and pretend
it's all skill i think that's the secret
just doing endless like uh alabaster box
place
okay you know it now that we know that
there's a bad trip in there there's a
full health so you got nothing to worry
about
can of corn
what's your favorite factory smell is
that like a normal
thing that people no i already know the
answer to that question
[Laughter]
that's not a normal thing i immediately
i merely ask you to explain yourself
okay now this is good stuff you know a
bomb for god's flesh
it's not an item i have a great deal of
respect for but we'll we'll take
it either way
as in like a new car so like your
favorite new
product smell i always like the smell of
a dairy queen
it's like a weird smell but uh
it's like industrial coolant or
something but a dairy queen always has
like a weird kind of like
aroma to it
why though something to do with the
refrigeration i think
there's like like nitrogen gas gets
pumped into the whole building or
something
this is tier size
you gotta give this a try you know the
the doubled up items you got to give it
a try we could still do boss rush we
gotta go a little faster to say the
least but
i was just making a guess i don't i
don't know if it's actually nitrogen gas
we've got a lot of whmis employees who
have taken great issue with those
those comments
maybe they add the ice cream smell into
the nitrogen gas so you don't huff it
because that would probably be bad for
your brain right
it's not sulfur i know sulfur
but like i think dairy queen counts as a
factory smell because it's not the
like when you go into the subway it
smells like the bread
you know that would be what's your
favorite new smell subway
what's your favorite factory smell
subway i don't think so
dairy queen on the other hand i'm like
that's not that's not a food smell
that's a chemical smell i think it
counts
okay okay
subway smells gross wrong
well someone's gonna have to spank him
maybe you
you know what that's not the wrong way
to describe maybe it's some kind of
chlorine
like chlorine smells like a dairy queen
smells like a swimming pool changing
room
i could definitely see that there it's
not a dissimilar smell
but i i kind of like the smell of the
swimming pool chlorine as well
yep i mean it's probably not chlorine
gas now that i think about it
that's when you mix cleaning products at
home and accidentally like
scar your lungs
forget the deal with the devil man i
don't think it's happening i we should
try something even if we get a deal with
the devil we should try to finesse some
deals with the angel man
because you could take multiple deals
with the angel with jacob and esau
that's the ticket it will become an
angel room andrew or something like that
let's not go with andrew let's go with
um
a different name that starts with an a
how about andy here we go
problem solved there we go okay deal
with the devil
hypothetically earned
i'm not afraid anymore
that's pretty good in fact i would say
that that's very good
boss rush is going to be a little tough
the deal no we're not going to the deal
we're going to deals with the angel now
if you don't go
this is what i've been told if you don't
go
to your first
deal with the devil you get a guaranteed
angel
on your next boss fight
put your question marks in your pocket
this is true
not guaranteed oh on your next deal not
on your next boss
okay well still that's still what i'm
looking for
but i i will say it puts uh a little bit
of a monkey wrench into it because
now i realize i've still got to not take
red heart damage
yeah i did um i i did read online
that the smell that we think of as as
swimming pool chlorine is actually just
the
chemical byproduct of when um
the chlorine in the swimming pool reacts
with urine
um but like i know it's supposed to like
gross you out
but if you were under the opinion that
like a swimming pool does not have
urine in it to begin with especially
like a big public pool
you were just living in a naive world to
begin with and honestly i'm happy that
your
your bubble has been shattered it's not
a sanitary place to be
i mean you're literally like you're in
the same
vessel of water as like
little kids like little toddlers and
stuff like that you really think they're
not just letting it fly
that's fake news it reacts with
any urea so it could just be sweat yeah
it could be
could just be a bunch of like you know
sweaty kids sweating it up in the pool
suppose there's one that's one thing it
could be
i was at a friend's pool and it smelled
like that yo what your friend
has got a pool that has so much
chlorination you can actually smell it
like that what's it like
oh you live in the upper east side
all pools smell like that you got to go
to some above ground
pools in rural ontario they do not smell
like that
they smell like like leeches and
flat dr pepper
anyway even if that's not the smell this
created when the chlorine
reacts
hold on this this is the thinking man's
gamble here um
i'm telling you that that pool is full
of pee
don't blow yourself up
he's so smart um so i think
forget the middle for now
the other two items are pretty good
you go here
you go here we walk into them we're
happy
wait is the middle item still there hold
on i always forget
no okay it's like some of them you can
take all three right
wait if you take the middle and the left
do you get to also take the third one as
well
you get to take the non-question mark
right yeah yeah okay
so in the future we should not do it
like that fair enough
donkey dunk okay this is your easy play
still got a chance at a deal but
dude the didn't get it didn't get it but
that's okay
we we put up an honest-to-goodness try
there
now i do want to go to the mirror
dimension but like at some point we
gotta
acknowledge um the folly of this
anyway the point is look you're
you ever been on the highway those
people that are driving
used to be kids some of them still are
you put you you look at them nobody's
using their signal lights they're
inconsiderate they don't care about
anybody else
i think we should have you both become
the lost
maybe not but it does protect your hp as
long as you don't
get hit two times um you're telling me
that as
as kids they weren't peeing in the pool
i don't believe it
100 they were peeing in the pool
you can lie to yourself all you want but
uh
i think you're you're swimming in urine
it's just the price you pay
for the recreation of going to a pool
it's worth it
i've been of the opinion ever since i
was a a little kid
that every pool i go into unless it's
like private
is gonna probably have somebody else's
like urine in it
still win swimming all the time it's
just fun
if that puts you off from uh
from swimming then honestly good for me
you know less crowded
so i don't think this will actually work
based on what i know from tinted jacob i
don't know if this will actually work
but
we got it it totally worked okay never
mind totally worked
plus like i don't know anything about
pool maintenance but like isn't that
what
the chlorine's there for to begin with
i thought the the chlorine was there as
like a a p neutralizer
okay is is modestly spicy some people
will tell you not to do this
and and i mean like we we ourselves have
gone through it many times and
determined that it is
almost never the right call to actually
try to get this item
but i'm gonna do it anyway because we
got a plum
flute i think plum flute can do it
[Laughter]
whoops
i know gamers who don't fight the mirror
boss and they're all cowards
exactly man looks precisely
okay drop it quick it's these flies
these flies are the worst
saved destroyed look at it just bodied
okay now a tears upgrade belongs to you
sir
belongs to you
serious question what does can of corn
mean i'm gonna stop saying it it's not
it's not like offensive it's only
offensive that it's from uh
the longest yard also known as adam
sandler's money laundering scheme
2005 uh but
i can't stop saying it because it's
lodged in my brain
all i'm gonna say is if you don't fight
the mirror boss you probably pull down
your pants to pee at the urinal
you probably use a bag or a pair of
scissors to open a bag of potato chips
and i'll tell you 100 you definitely pee
in the pool
but on top of that you also tattle on
other people
you're the kind of guy you you pee in
the pool but then you also go like
hey i bet tony peed in the pool right
pee
pooler pool pier pool pier
100 percent
the worst kind
sorry this damage is just damage taken
to whom much is given much is tested
great start
is too specific there's all i mean it's
the
it's the classic he who smelt it dealt
it is there a worse legal defense than
that
hey who farted he who smelt it doubted
it's literally like it's the most
nonsensical defense you could possibly
muster
hey i'd like to report a murder i saw a
dead body
oh really
have you ever heard of the legal defense
of he who smelt it dalton and then
i i wills of the two he who denied it
supplied it
i believe that that probably has a
greater incidence of being correct
there's a tinted rock there but
need a bomb
oh we're gonna get a bomb
in baseball you say can of corn when
it's an easy pop fly
you know
that i did not know but i will say by
the way thank you to everybody
who was like hey turn your tv on to uh
game mode and then you'll be able to
enjoy mlb the show
you're absolutely right turned my tv
into game mode uh and literally went
from batting
like 110 and just being confused about
like
like i'm pressing the button but it just
feels wrong to
uh i hit two home runs in my first game
and i was like oh this is what the game
is supposed to be like
and then the difficulty adjusted upwards
because it's dynamic difficulty and uh
you know now i'm kind of like back at
the a lower batting average but i'm
having a better time like i feel like my
swings are
going when they're supposed to go yeah i
guess it reduces input
lag um at the expense of making the
picture quality worse
but i honestly noticed no difference in
quality whatsoever
um and an enormous difference in input
lag
tvs i dude i'm not a believer in the
smart tv i'm definitely
like i'm a stupid tv sort of guy
we've been down this road before
i just like i mean it's it's a pretty
minor like first world problem
pro i like that my tv remote has a
button that just
sends me to netflix khan it also has a
button that sends me to cbs
all access which i do not care about
whatsoever
and it also has a button for deezer and
i don't even know what deezer
even is um i know i know the joke that's
being made
right now but um
huge con why does my tv
take a control
space why does my tv take
uh three minutes well it doesn't take
three minutes let's not go crazy
but like why does it take 10 seconds for
my tv to boot up
when in 1996 like all you did was press
a button and it went like
and it was good to go
are you dead where are you god's flesh
okay whatever this is a bad item anyway
i kind of agree dude i'm glad find some
common ground here
and then like sometimes like it just
fails to connect to the
wi-fi when it turns this hitbox man it
fails to connect to the wi-fi when it
turns on so then i turn it off and i
turn it on it fails to connect to the
wi-fi
and then i turn it on off and i turn it
on and it's like ah there it is
it's a tcl i'm not gonna flex and be
like oh it's the most amazing tv
ever made but i'm like it's it's
what happened is that when we were
moving
we were gonna like we bought a bunch of
new furniture we bought a bunch of new
electronics and also we were buying a
house in vancouver so it was like
10 quadrillion dollars so kate was like
hey do you want to get like an expensive
tv or a smart tv
or like a an expensive tv or a cheap tv
and i was like ah let's just get one
that we like find on the side of the
road and she was like we can't do that
so we ended up uh buying like a
pretty i mean like a budget price tcl
but like i'm still kind of of the
opinion where i'm like
like even if this is the budget brand
like how was a budget brand in
2019 at the time worse than like a
budget
brand picture tube tv in
1998
but anyway
hold on i gotta get my dissertation done
to figure out how to use these pills
as each character
this should be okay
one in one in five chance more or less
one in five chance for a deal with the
angel this could turn this whole run
around
what did i tell you okay don't
accidentally walk downwards
now we're talking okay now i see the
value of the deal with the angel here
give me a little bit of this
a little bit of that we love it
you know what i mean we got a little
chance to fight mega satan
i feel like we got to take advantage of
that little chance to fight mega satan
we never know when we'll be back here as
uh
as jacob and esau we may abandon our alt
path we already did abandon our ball
our old path even better flooded caves
too
all right so we should try to do mega
satan then
i was i was in the business talking
about tvs
i was in another world
yeah i'm feeling like maybe i gotta
start giving uh
angel deals a little bit more respect
key it might matter just as as a
principle just put everything on that
guy man
don't be stupid and if we're going to
mega satan we can take as long as we
want
and take as long as we want
you definitely do not want to get rid of
the sun card for luck down
i don't even know what i hit quite
frankly that you just got to get used to
that kind of energy when you're playing
jacob and esau
we do have holy mantle so here's what
you do
walk in like that
i got a great idea here now this it
requires moving parts
so here's what you do okay you get get
them stacked up
get ready to leave no we don't leave
okay i'm not freaking leaving
i'm leaving i'm then
returning but hiding out
safely
then we're opening this up very quickly
and that's why you do it
that's why you do it
that's a can of corn right there
[Laughter]
omega brain
but why though i wouldn't expect you to
understand don't care
didn't ask plus your chat
okay we got zero cents i'm gonna sun
card immediately on the next floor
don't care didn't ask plus you're a
cloud
control space control control q control
space
control control q he's done it
i knew it never a doubt in my mind
okay we're just chilling control space
verb control q
lock down now that's a good one glad i
burped that
it's you know like there's just a lot of
stuff
you got to keep your eyes out for like
you're already playing as two characters
and then you're like oh yeah one of
them's got holy mantle so make sure you
use him as like a human shield whenever
possible
oh and yeah like also on top of that
like can you remember what pill you had
six floors ago as this guy
maybe yes maybe no but for me it's it's
definitely no
it's too much
purple horde
actually moon card is pretty good can
you give me a control q on that one
not control space two two very different
things
there's these are omega runs man
i'm like we're 23 minutes in we're on
the depths one
that's okay because you know what we got
a great great deal with the angel chance
here
have you tried sparkling ice bubbly uh
we don't speak about that corporation
anymore

spark mouth if you'd like to get in
touch my dms on twitter are open

please contact northernlionbusiness
gmail.com
that's all that needs to be said
still holding the grudge it's not a
grudge it's just business

time to respond to them and
you know maybe they'll feel that way
forever maybe they'll
maybe they'll change their mind at some
point they know where to reach me

i tell all other strangers and brands i
have no interest in working with to
reach me
spark mouth the dms are open anytime
it's on site but in a good way
bubbly redemption arc balls in their
court
check this out okay watch this
you pop it control space the man he's
the smartest man has ever lived
then
you come down here and you got a great
opportunity
use the plum flute i didn't want to have
to mess around with purple heart that's
the whole reason i did that
it's not a great reason um
but it is the reason
get get out of here stop hitting me
yeah we're gonna have to add a new rule
to chat which is like honestly
i might even not put this in the rules
because i'd rather you just be surprised
by it
but if i look at your message history
and you have
more than one comment per day that's
three question marks instant
actual ban unban request denied
stamped mod comment from the streamer
that says don't open dead inside
get ready
i'm not saying it's gonna happen i'm
just saying you know i got a day to
percolate on it on uh
on saturday we'll see new rules have
mostly done a pretty good job i think
occasionally people get a little ornery
during isaac
i can't maintain the moral superiority
of like any time i make fun of like
twitter for i
dash dash cause not what do you do you
know like stammering over themselves
i can't maintain the superiority uh and
do that um well
my audience whenever they see something
on the screen that they disagree with
they just type three question marks
it's it's hypocritical insubordinate and
churlish
one question mark i'll allow
two question marks usually a typo i
think it's the three question marks
which is like the first question mark is
i'm confused
the second one is like i'm angry and the
third one is like i'm insulting you
okay dude we're definitely taking this
look at the coverage
look at the coverage we're gonna get now
finally he's done it bootleg triple shot
yeah exactly
this is like a pirated dvd of of triple
shot
poor man's conjoined i mean it's not
like jacob is doing anything anyway like
look at the items i've given jacob
he has little brim and experimental
treatment and everything well and
holy water but holy water and little
brim are like it's just a machine gun
with an
uh barrel mounted grenade launcher
like he's basically just he he exists
just to carry
that's that's pretty useful right there
though i'm not gonna say no to that
um he's covering fire
i think i'm gonna buy both
you know grunted whatever i'm not hungry
anyway as that's one of the top copy
pastas that's a copy pass that you can
you can hang your hat on
i'm a fool
i'm a fool i got even
the second one was even worse okay
hold on i was like i'll just kick the
bomb in there
can't kick the bomb and i'll be all
right petrified
poop okay hold on petrified not
petrified poop the plum is gonna do this
for us anyway like
the the flute is gonna kill the boss all
we need to do is hang out
the flute is going to do
some damage to the boss whatever man 7.2
chance of a deal with the angel
7.2 percent
it's like a one in sixteen chance pick a
number between one and sixteen
hold on we're clip farming
never tell me the odds pick a number
between one and sixteen 4.
i thought we got it for a second there i
thought we got it i was very excited
um
speed up doesn't really doesn't really
concern me
verb speed up why not dude
okay i mean that was three speed
upgrades like that's pretty good
i guess we're down to the next floor i'm
missing too much here send me dude
send me
do the eddy room that's actually a good
idea
the eddy room if we if we were i mean we
had hp there we could have we could have
leaned on
we should definitely do the eddy room
next
if we need the support and because it's
30 minutes and we're on
necropolis 2 i would say there's a
pretty good chance we probably need the
support
also there is no eddie room
okay i could have told you that was
going to happen
[Laughter]
got this character it's so
frustrating to when there's more than
like two enemies on the screen
you know it hit the spot aoe coverage
toxic shock i forget the like there's
green biohazard in this red biohazard
dyemonium tv thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
there we go that invincibility
dymonium thank you thank you
come on man lovers card control space
good stuff we've dropped everything now
what is this cursed conjoined setup oh
this is the tcl conjoint
if you wanted samsung conjoined you
you've come to the wrong uh
the wrong stream
control cue
just thinking yeah okay well you should
take this
invested favorite uh alanis morissette
song that's a great question
this can be done you just gotta do it
like that
um
i do i'm not joking like uh you
to know is like an all-time classic i
feel um
head over feet is pretty good
i forgot that
hold on there's something i think we
want to do it like this
although the the damage it might not
matter i don't know dude there's so much
going on in this run
i hate to lose plum flute but i think
this is the right way to do it anyway
like the flute is a is a serious source
of damage for us
i don't know man like it's one of those
things there's so much
there's an endless amount to worry about
if you want to
i really want broken modem
at some point we gotta we gotta
acknowledge like the run's gotta it's
gotta go somewhere you know in order for
us to go somewhere we gotta stop talking
we gotta start playing
there's a lot to think about is that you
gotta you gotta draw the boundaries of
your own world otherwise you'll get
swallowed up by ambition you know
um
but favorite atlanta song that's that's
the real meat and potatoes head over
feed is good
i don't mind like one hand in my pockets
pretty good i think you ought to know is
like
that that song is like you know it's
it's acidic
you know it gets the people going it's
got it's got a real like uncomfortable
anger to
it like a canadian liz fair
i don't know what you do let's put you
on the unit we don't care for anyway
liz fair is canadian um doubt it
it's fruit fruitcake but good no way
okay oh hold on hold on
i like both mine both my boys equally
you that's a good meme you could use a
meme template there
whatever we got golden keys i wanted to
make sure make sure shielded tears went
on the unit that uh shoots straight
favorite avril lavigne song i don't know
man they're all kind of like omega bad
i don't shy away from them from liking
some
some stuff this top 40 but uh
they're they're all pretty not good
right like
the best is probably skater boy
it's got it's got a it's got a hook it
was definitely
it's a vestige of his of his era
complicated is just like i don't know i
find complicated
it's too easy listening it's got
literally like zero edge
it's the kind of song you could play in
a grocery store and like even tip or
gore would be like yo turn that up
i love this song
like i think when your song comes out
sounding like a less edgy
cheryl crow like it's time to put some
emotion into it
i don't know hello kitty i'll i'll admit
it okay i just i simply do not
girlfriend's got a hook i'll i'll give
it the credit for having a hook at least
but that's all i'm giving it credit for
what did tip or gore do to you it's just
my classic reference for like someone
who gets
offended by art
[Laughter]
just my code my go-to reference for
someone who uh
is like but that song has a swear word
in it so um
nl did you know he says the f word in
that song
okay 23 chance
deal with the angel now we're talking
i choose out of four numbers i choose
the number
two let's see
didn't didn't take damage there that's
fine hey well okay
first we need to make sure that jacob
doesn't get hit
in so many words we need to make sure
that jacob doesn't touch it
two please two
not two that's life what does this mean
nl only has nostalgia for mumble rock
the heck is mumble rock oh are you
talking about slint
guilty is charged
we're free we're free next floor we're
getting that deal
mumble rock is like rascal flats
i don't i i can't name a single rascal
flat song
unless they sing that one that i saw on
twitch that one time that was like thank
god for country girls thank god for
lyft trucks these are real lyrics by the
way
hubba stank no i have no nostalgia for
hubba stank
only good thing hubba stank ever did was
the music video for the song the reason
two of hearts no thank you
this is slander what hooba's think is
two songs okay so they
they have the reason which is by far the
most famous the
the music video and they're in they
robbed a bank
and what's the other one that's the real
question here
don't take my rotten heart my my icky
rotten heart
i just don't think you'd understand
cause if you take my heart we gotta do
my i got a two of hearts
crawling in the dark my wounds they will
not heal
no man
i don't know anything else about
hoover's tank i'm just being straight up
with you
i don't know if anybody else does either
like i'll just come out and say that i
think one of the big reasons
hubba stank is uh
known at all is because they got a funny
name
i think if they did not have a funny
name
that got people going you'd never hear
about them
if their name was like you know
bill mccoy and the boys like you'd you
would never hear of any of their songs
including the reason
you couldn't escape that song by the way
in the mid 2000s you're just like you
know driving through downtown
dish network bagging through text for
the location of the heiya
music video or at least yeah by usher
and mtv's like best i can do
the reason by hubba stank over and over
people were like calling in and
requesting that you're like what
you don't like to you haven't heard the
reason
in five minutes just wait
again
okay i mean this is how you can tell
like i'm
i'm going for broke on a run we're
actually deliberately using a two room
properly
doesn't happen too often great yeah
that's about the average yield from that
chest so
no no sweat
okay i'm trying to figure out how i'm
watch this okay
this is gigabrain i don't want
uh jacob to move because he doesn't have
holy mantle
so i just made sure i would just run to
the right as fast as i could
and make sure he ran into a rock over
and over it's actually like
at least we got one smart play today
i'm trapped i'm free
just hold control um control is how you
only move jacob there's no way to only
move esau
that i know of
yes sorry i realized after
no problem i'm gonna become the joker um
okay we got our deal with the devil
it's still it it you know this is a good
is a good thing because it doesn't
matter who takes it then
just say what you meant to say sorry you
read it out loud
okay get trapped in the blue fires of
lake minnetonka
this is actually going to be like an 80
minute long
mega satan run this is absurd
this is our chance for uh for the
backlog on youtube to catch up to twitch
[Laughter]
do you listen to any foreign music i've
been known to listen to some american
songs
from time to time but i'm feeling
particularly exotic
i've considered it
then i come to my senses
and then that there's the other one the
one that goes
to that one's pretty sick
can con only baby
have i talked yet about how um
can con has ruined our version of hbo
because all they can do is play
canadian documentaries instead of what i
subscribed for which is american
documentaries
i think i've talked about it is mega bad
dude
our version of like hbo max is fine but
if you're trying to watch something like
over the air best of luck to you
no eddie room tower card
i'm i don't possess the brain power i
don't
we'll be moving on
interesting question here would we
rather go to the chest
or would you rather go to the dark room
i don't know i almost feel like like the
new meta for me
is that the negative actually gives you
more of a benefit than the polaroid on
the average run
which means that i could see myself okay
cool
um turning the negative into the default
and then the chest run is almost like
the most
uh is the one that you gotta flex for
so in that case if this run is good we
would rather go to the chest
because the dark room we would just
happen
uh we would just do naturally at some
point anyway so
i don't know maybe maybe we'll go chest
on this one you have both anyway
that's why i'm asking the question is
because we can only go in one direction
but we possess both of the keys
so i i think you know when you're when
you're spoiled for choice in this sense
i think um
i think it makes sense to take the
non-default path but the weird thing is
that i think the default path
is uh is now the dark room
now that's an idea what if you could
send one guy up one guy down
what if you could have one guy uh from
up the sun up the sun down rolling
around see where the bad guys are to be
found
send one up one down
split screen drifting
come on conjoined budget conjoined
genius okay 24
chance of a deal with the devil
i predict you know what i'm sticking
with two number two
number two baby who does number two work
for
he works for me
that is right i did it okay you get a
tears up with rosary now
so that's how you do it oh baby
and then you sir you can take that
forget delirium
forget delirium for now forget it for
the time being don't think about it
forget we can we there's a chance to go
back in the other direction
rosary it's the the greatest thing they
did in this game rosary is no longer
total garbage
and uh the negative is no longer total
garbage
no i went up
i just discussed it please refer to my
earlier email
i'm going to the chest because i feel
like my new normal
will be going to the dark room so i'm
going to the one
that is aberrant so that i can remember
or i don't have to remember next time
which one to go to because i'm going to
go to the dark room
because the dark room it might not
necessarily be easier it's actually
harder
but getting deals with the devil is nice
and also taking the negative is like the
default because it's a damage upgrade
now
as per my earlier email
doesn't matter too much get me out of
here
why am i going the wrong direction oh
i'm not i'm farming uh
spirit hearts
i've got 60 hours in this and watching
you play makes me realize i actually
don't know anything
dude it's like
i was trying to explain it on drop
frames it's really like i don't know i
got
3000 hours and i feel like i know very
little
it's just it's a staggering game to
to try to like wrap your hands around to
get some kind of purchase on you know
what i mean
so i wouldn't feel bad about that in the
in the slightest
that's year no that's hagalaz we don't
care and if you don't care then we don't
care
this should be like you don't have to
take a driving test if you can get
through this room without getting hit
so uh i'll see you at the track
i saw bear play team melt and it was
glorious he had infinite lives but he
could not win
like oh like he was like mathematically
like just gated from winning
that's funny i mean that i've seen a
couple like that as well like dan's team
held run
every team out run has like its own
unique character right
like dan couldn't lose but winning was
very difficult
and not just like um well i mean we'll
just say it specifically you know he had
infinite lives but he could never get
more than one hp so he had to
beat every room on the cathedral in the
chest
without getting hit a single time on it
of course i had multiple wild ones
including one where we beat the boss but
the trophy turned into a uh a rocket
bomb and then blasted off the screen
everyone's doing t-melt man everyone's
doing team melt
just asking for one person on planet
earth
to find it in their in their heart to
play mouths revenge
in hitman please just a single
a single gamer could find it
in their in their spirit to play the
custom homemade challenge i made in in
hitman 3 specifically for them
bro you're leaking you just just took
out tomato
town
so much content waiting to be farmed
dude i'm i'm actually getting a little
stoked we're actually gonna fill things
out on the jacob and esau post-it note
now it's gonna be a run that is of an
unbelievable length
but still
don't make fun of jacob and esau's
damages please
they're doing their best
i'm sick of people treating tomato town
like it's some kind of meme
i like that's a good bit people died
susan
that's all right i didn't mapping is not
good anyway
um you're absolutely right use the yarra
rune
there you go 1.5 times with the era
it's even better than double um
okay well um why don't you take this
why don't you take this
dude i don't know i'm gonna i'm gonna
take triple shot on fake
triple shot just to see how it looks
that's funny it's double shot instead
that's cool that's cute
that's that's hip i'm with it you've
already got familiars
so why don't you take another familiar
just in the hopes it gives you conjoined
even though i know it doesn't
and then um let's start making our way
in the world today
we're probably not gonna get a lot of
items but
it's okay it is what it is
just fight mega sand you've already done
blue baby
you're absolutely right i have already
done blue baby
saved thank you
that's that's good eats wait a minute
now i'm like wait a minute is that
it's that light path or dark path
it's right next to the
to the cross but that yes that's blue
baby okay i knew that i was just testing
let's just test and chat quick tears
downgrade then we're ready to go
i will say we should we probably should
have taken teleport
um just in case the you know things
started going so badly
we could have uh escaped but
alas here we are
guess we could get a battery charge
oh my god do we haven't even spawned
like the first wave
yeah you're not part of the first wave
are you you're just a normal you're just
a normal enemy
this is actually like a horrible
i'm loving the shielded tears don't get
me wrong i'm hating just about
everything else
just keep keep the enemies or keep keep
your units close together
you got broken modem
you got the ability to slow
we're going to be here for a bit okay we
we got we got nerfed the little brim
so there's there's something there hey
you know what we do have as well i
didn't even use it yet we got little
haunts
little haunts just up here challenge
boy the streamers get all the luck in
this game wouldn't you say
this i don't even have a bag of holding
to blame on this one
there you go we've killed the first of
four horsemen you're gonna give me a
spirit heart right
okay never mind so is little haunt just
like
uh he's just like a millennial like he
only works when he wants to
i can say it i'm a millennial okay
if somebody born like prior to 1980 said
that
i would join you in roasting them but
like just let's just have a laugh about
it together
hey
i can laugh at it even though i'm a
zoomer though uh no absolutely not
if i wanted your opinion uh i'd go to
tiktok
come on man i'm just i'm just begging
you don't use your brimstone laser
i got it i got it hey easy there
okay thank you broken modem
i can't believe we made it to phase two
already
twitter and tick tock are fiercely
competing
for biggest internet cesspool um
well they're never going to win as long
as facebook exists
so they're like they're they're
competing for probably like fifth place
right now to be honest but facebook's
definitely ahead of both of them
twitter is more toxic than facebook
i don't know why why don't we run a
little experiment
why don't you get in your family's
facebook group chat and
tell them you got the astrazeneca
vaccine and then just report back with
the logs
let's let's do let's do a little science
here
it's miserable
oh my god
why the heck did you get a second
vaccine
you know i know why you got a second
vaccine to take it away from a streamer
who
so rightfully deserves one
i see your group chance
no oh
dude i i honestly i feel like we hit
like a pity timer or something
like even phase one mega satan is like
this is just embarrassing like i got a
lunch appointment
get me out of here just kill me already
are you gonna kill me or are you just
gonna stand there
you're trying to kill the alzab yellow
[__] you little redeemer
i guess i still got 14 bombs man i still
got 14
bombs i'm still cool hey i can still
wear my clothes from high school
i'm still cool
7 equals 14 yes
all right keep it moving man because i
want to get to uh
i want to get to the delirium fight i
think i think that delirium would really
hit the spot here
oh that's all right i was doing it for
the aoe damage
okay once we throw those bombs in there
we got to stop shooting but as soon as
as soon as we stop
shooting we lose all of our defense
look at the double kick
i'm just begging them not to open the
delirium portal
free me from having the choice please
you know what let's not count our
chickens yet like this runs not over
but this fight's not over i should say
you only got three hp left on jacob he's
getting pretty weak don't get me wrong
but
please don't open the delirium portal
just
just give me the chest everybody can
leave this run with good feelings
it can go down in history as like one of
the worst runs that ever succeeded
oh my god don't open it dude don't open
it
we gotta like you know it's gotta happen
we're probably we did unlock something
so there's that
if anything we should be stoked i hate
that we got rid of the nail but it was
the right play in the moment
but if anything we should be stoked
that we have a chance
to unlock all this stuff on this run you
know and the chance is free
leave all spirit hearts behind for now
yeah yeah yeah leave all spirit hearts
behind for now
time check we're on triple digits
confirmed we're on triple digits now
this is an all-timer man
thoughts on jacob and esau
what's driving me right now is that i
know that there's only
like two out of seven days of the week i
ever wanna
play as jacob and esau so i'm taking
advantage of the fact that for the time
being
i you know we're already on a good run
so let's try to make it actually happen
it's a big floor no question um we're
just looking for fights that are not
going to
be delirium or at least have the lowest
percentage chance to be delirium
is this the same run i can't remember if
we
if we bricked uh
a jacob and esau run before this one got
started oh you're
you're healing minions you little [__]
but um
this is definitely like the it's amongst
the first one
first ones i should say we can get some
items here man
yeah like this run has gone on for so
long that like at the start of it i
actually thought
i had a decent tv before i was cyber
bullied
worth it
that was like an hour ago yeah that's
why i'm going down here because like the
the bottom middle can't be delirium
all the other boss fights i like i feel
like there's a chance that they could be
delirium i don't i don't worry about the
sweet science that closely but this one
i'm pretty confident can't be
take a teleport card until you find
delirium
look i'm not trying to rain down any
sort of negativity
have we seen a teleport card on this
floor
so we haven't seen a teleport card on
the floor like it's a little academic
you know like there is no
take unless one exists
we've entered a new realm of like
hypothetical backseating
okay i'm thinking yeah i top left bottom
i think is the uh
is the next one we're just clearing some
rooms down here
uh wait how'd you get hit
oh you're not getting hit it's sidjula
baphomet
yeah i'm not fighting this uh this boss
here
no need to press q yet wait no need to
press space yet need to press q
you know what there you go i can't
believe
you you [__] such a
fresh awesome fresher
all right nevertheless
dang heisenberg uncertainly principal
abusing
paradox creating
a simple calculus i was i was reading
comments that were like
you'll probably get one with the crystal
ball and i was gonna in my head i was
like don't go
off don't they don't know the odds of
you getting one with the crystal ball
and then we freaking got one with the
crystal ball man
although i think that the now that i
think about it i
think that the emperor card and this is
not to preserve me in the argument it's
just to preserve me like
in in life here but i feel like the
emperor card always takes you to
real delirium
which is a scary thought it doesn't okay
last time i used it it took me to real
delirium
oh wolf claw thank you for the the
gifted subscriptions thank you
but that that must have just been you
know like it it hit the the either the
high roll or the low roll depending on
your perspective
okay don't get that donkey
do you not get items in delirium land uh
you actually
you can get a lot of items in delirium
land because you get them from
the bosses that you fight that are not
delirium which is why i'm i'm really
taking my
my time farming it up
you know normally i'd uh
i prefer to just kind of rush it down
but it's definitely not that kind of run
it's also like we're leaving all um just
use the finger
oh no
mom's lock i have no idea what it is
i thought the finger would protect us
there though um
quite the opposite dude these spirit
hearts from relic are
popping off
random mom items okay so we're leaving
all spirit hearts behind till the end
just so that we can unless if we need
them we'll come back and pick them up
but
prior to the hush fight we'll make sure
every unit is at full hp
maybe mom's lock will give us um
mom's knife for the void fight that
would be really nice
hush delirium you know tanky boss you
can never reliably dodge
you know in insert name here
anyone have recommendations for
isaac lore ah i'll just you got any
questions i'll just answer them right
now
so it's like isaac is like a kid and
he's his mom's like
i love i hate you i love you i hate how
much i love you
but lord forgive me for what i'm about
to do
and then um she thinks that
oh jeez one moment please one moment
streamer is temporarily
frozen stun locked um
she thinks that joel ossoff uh
has told her she has to murder her child
in order to save their soul
and then it's like it's kind of you can
engage in some like
wacky hijinks and stuff like that like a
wicked day
that's going to do do you do and then
like at the end of the game you
reconcile and it's
uh wait not joel
osof sorry joel joel osteen that's the
one
hope i don't oh soft
can you explain the keeper arg something
something
100 stake in a single bite something
something
bottom should be safe what uh
see you later
saved game this just consider yourself
game
system
it's just it's just long fights man
these are just long fights
isn't this how long like one of us
invicta's uh isaac runs is normally
[Laughter]
i should have made that joke at mouth's
expense
can confirm where's the timer timer
109 12.
what percent likelihood do you think
you'll win this run
i don't know honestly like i kind of
feel like
it's above 50 percent right now we got a
very
stable situation
that's not what you're hoping to get
obviously but we have a very stable
situation
it's pretty hard for us to die before
the boss fight
so the only thing that can kill us
is the boss fight that was not very
smart um
i thought holy mantle would protect us a
little bit longer
just this car we can we can drop that on
on the fight um
so really the question is what are the
odds you think if you have full hp
you'll beat delirium with this like
anemic damage
and the answer is like i don't know man
with a bunch of hp
i think we got a good shot but i would
also minimize the odds a little bit
because
it's really tough to dodge with with
jacob and esau
it's it's mighty tricky
but um okay it's also going to take
forever
miss 12 spirit hearts
haha so true i wouldn't say i've been
missing them uh bob
i'm hoping and and i don't know if this
is real this is like maybe just
delusion which i guess you know is apt
but um i'm hoping
that maybe there's like a mechanic in
the game
where if you're so bad
the boss just is like okay just scale
the hp down
incredible
[Laughter]
there's not there's nothing like hey if
if they haven't done
10 of the damage in like you know
five minutes they just like make the
health bar go down
nothing like that huh
i mean this is a marathon i don't want
to hear i mean i'm never going to say
like
don't say it again because like that's a
long time
but
i don't ever want to hear like oh he's
just rushing through the run he's not
focusing on the run ever again man
like look this is this is crazy
i think it might take like if we make it
to the lyrium i think it might take
like an hour to beat
maybe that's a gross overestimate but
armor does scale in reverse if your
damage is really bad
but i think yours is over you think so
i mean it's possible the run is not
zero damage it's just it's just low
and like it it's easy to cherry pick
isaac by the way
isaac because it's like extreme oh my
god my freaking head dude
dude i'm freaking losing it dude
[Laughter]
dude what was in that salmon i had for
lunch dude that's
whoa dude
okay we'll we will never use it for good
but
two more bosses how about that
bro how much mercury was in that salmon
dude
i told you we gotta get the the stuff
from the farm not the stuff from the
ocean
i love this bit no you got to say it in
the same voice that um
lil wayne uses for uh the start of
upgrade you
i let his bit so let me talk
my bit oh you didn't think i listened to
lil wheezy
you didn't think i could i could go that
hard
ever listen to small cough i have no
idea what that means the only cough i
know is strawberry cough
the the cannabis strain michael kane
smokes in the 2006 movie children of men
andy kaufman the coffin man
yeah yeah yeah yeah
okay oh
newton got beaned by the apple yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
monopoly 21 checkers and yeah
chest chest chest chest
see you in heaven with a baja blast
yeah yeah yeah yeah
kevin did you hear about this one
meatless burgers at burger king
when i was a kid the only thing that was
meatless
oh was the hot dog so i'd class
i thought it was a pretty good joke it's
just hard to frame it for twitter okay
what's your wendy's order why are you
going
i'm a simple man i'm a i'm a spicy uh
spicy chicken sandwich guy that's
in this spicy chicken sandwich combo
everything else standard i'll take a
coke zero to drink
yes sir
spicy chicken deluxe yo what's the
deluxe
sesame seeds on the bun
it has lettuce and tomato isn't it
that's normally on it right
or maybe it's just is it the secret way
to order it
oh secret way incredible
two two of diamonds by the way box of
friends by the way
um
i mean doubling up lil brim is actually
like pretty valuable
and we could get two charges on it by
giving it to the
the other person nice double damage
plus the emperor card yeah i mean
yeah yeah yeah yeah tomo have you heard
about this one
sorry i can't open the door tomorrow
do you need to use the little hey baby
just go on the floor
but if you please only go poo don't go
pee
please don't go pee if you go pee
it's so much harder to clean
please just a poo
kind of worked huh
please just immediately stop your pee
and please just
hit it it isn't even clear
if you pee there later than before
afternoon's gone afternoon's got
wouldn't it be nice if you didn't pee
on the floor the office is so clean
and if you could just do a number two
and hold the number one till after
three
so many bowel movements you be holding
and then my hardwood floor it won't
be golden
why is he singing because the kids were
an hour and 18 minutes into the damn run
we got jacob and esau
jacob's got 4.44 damage esau's got 4.68
damage
and we're fighting delirium
that's why i lost it okay
what happens when society
meets a socially ill reject
makes fun of them and cyberbullies them
in
quantum bank seats him you get what you
freaking deserve
this is what happens when you bend a
ruler too far it snaps back
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i like that one
i might use that one
okay give me give me some flies thank
you
dude i'm we we might be just be good to
go here okay just just give this a sec
you've got no respect for the damage
that serves as the foundation of a
winnable run
hello hello hello chibly hello
hey chib uh ape together strong
man this is like a really bad run to
like i feel for all the
people out there that were like i'm just
gonna watch this one and then i'm gonna
do my homework
or maybe i don't know maybe i feel good
for him
it's me
this one run is gonna be like half the
stream whatever this holy mantle who
cares
i was waiting to walk the dog until you
finished
woof that's fine we can spread the love
a little bit
i never commented on your streams before
but now i'm
high and drunk as hell so i'm just gonna
spam
s word in the chat is that okay
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
main character syndrome
you know what just go get it get a cup
of water and then come back and
and you know just
spam to your heart's content
you can get a mug if you want i'm not
gonna i'm not gonna police it um
you know spread it out just a little bit
here
sus
i do i kind of feel like we should have
another uh
charge maybe but can i get a hey thomas
can i get a water
you really have to leave buddy okay i
mean i gotta let him out of here
just give me one moment here
i gotta get him out of here i don't want
him to
i don't want to definitely
he's gonna want in about halfway through
the uh
through the delirium fight i'm sure
why even pause you know what that's a
pretty good point honestly
that's a pretty good point i mean i
guess if if you're doing things right
here you should probably go
get like yum heart there's oh there's
another
spirit hard back here as well
donkey donkey
and you're just gonna okay um no yes
yum hard no that's remote detonator
we could surround him with 12 bombs
that's true
lover's card
lover's card beats justice card
no so honestly i'm like
top right for yamaha okay thank you
thank you i'm i'm keeping this
mom's lock instead of the uh
instead of going for the poison the the
reason is because
i don't know it's probably like a one in
15 chance
but if we get mom's knife oh man
[Laughter]
then it'll slightly increase
the speed
of the of the fight i think we got i
think we're ready to go i think we're
simply ready to go
what's the best situation for this fight
oh man well
like first off you double everything
that you've got
you don't let your characters get
separated like this it'll be very
confusing
you know what i'm going to drop the
emperor card just because like
i mean for what i assume are pretty
obvious reasons
and then you can just take this there
you go
control space is what you need here okay
can of corn baby
here we go
double double toil in trouble cauldron
bake and cauldron bubble eye of
newt and lego frog
poop d scoop and hair of dog
damage please
he's cast in the mfn spell admin
loving the modem loving
holy water loving keeping our units like
next to each other
anytime you get the chance you just keep
them steady here
oh lord the damage well you jealous
hey don't forget by the way we have
three knife handles
no we don't
yo foot's easy to hit
let's go we take those we take those
and this is less of a test of your isaac
skill at this point
and substantially more a test of your
patience as a human being
so the fact that like i'm still chilling
on this run
and like reasonably sane should let you
know
like the the psychic damage that
streaming with josh can
actually like impart upon you
feet easy
that seemed fair um
i'm not sick i'm twisted sick implies
there's a cure
[Laughter]
you disgust me
they're not they're not in sync anymore
i'm just worried about beams bro
not beans beans this mf worried about
beans no i'm worried about beans
dude legit esau has not been hit what a
world
i think holy water is doing like a lot
of
it's doing a lot man who would have
thought
trip little brim trip little haunt
trip holy water
trip golden bug spray
you troubling your little [__]
i told you i'm worried about beams with
an m look at that you tried
no those those are even worse beams
no no no oh
saved okay then that was not the best
damage we've ever taken but
the cracked gamer has logged on
my god and i'll do it again bob
what the heck large hand just came out
of nowhere
i don't even know what to say i mean if
a run is gonna take
like longer than 50 minutes it might as
well take an hour and a half
yeah i got bombs but like it's it's
really hard to place them in like a
place that's gonna actually
blow up and do damage and not to me
i can't believe esau still has fully
mantle
ah come on
what the heck is that
oh my word
you just gotta believe my my advice for
dodging that attack is just believe
it's a little micro step get them back
in get them back in
conjunction with one another okay two
angels two angels
this is getting out of hand he said it
highest damage dealer lil brim
second highest damage dealer and i'm
being zero percent
pretend here finger
honestly
i i i knew it was coming but that's okay
i genuinely think it's finger
maybe he's so fast dude
maybe holy water okay now things are
getting spiced
saved
incredible eats on the lovers card
just for peace of mind that's changed
everything
we probably were gonna make it to begin
with but the peace of mind has
has changed the game
the hand is so good it also takes like
more damage i think
frick frick
they're normally like 10 bosses on the
screen at the same time
incredible boss
it's a really really cohesive uh fight
i mean all of that like i'm not trying
to rag on them right but it just puts it
into perspective like
how good a job they did on the on the
end game bosses
uh from repentance oh god they're out of
sync
i mean like this is this whole run in
general is like an accident
but well
[Laughter]
no no doubt in my mind uh
time 131.43
easy easy money
take a little stretch after that one
that's i'm gonna go to the bathroom
after this as well
and that was just that was just
ridiculous
we did unlock a couple items on that
though dude getting all that stuff done
on jacob and esau feels mighty nice
mighty nice
[Laughter]
equals you equals thank you for the the
gifted subscriptions
i'm gonna go to the bathroom and uh i'll
be back hey just click the follow button
we're only 653
uh followers away from 420 000.
we're trying to get there by april the
20th 2022 so
we're almost there um i'm just gonna go
to the bathroom i'm not gonna



yes then you hydrate a little bit
you still need it all i thought you only
needed the shaded stuff for for unlocks
though
dude at some point we got to get kane
successfully done
let's let's just let it go man let's let
it go
let's send it dunce cap you know what it
turns into different things
so we say we say yes all right i already
know that you're gonna like hit me with
some uh
recipes i promise i will not be able to
read them in banter simultaneously and
also play the game and also make hush
and boss rush so
like i'm just telling you you got to
save your keystrokes not for my sake but
like for your sake because you're going
to lose your mind probably
put a little battery in there
just remember seven coins one soul heart
okay so
seven coins one soul heart is is
something we'll try to make
for now we might just get some stats
here or like just just
mass consumables but anyway
are basement suites a thing in south
korea the first thing i'll say i guess
is that i'm not like an expert on um
you know south korean real estate i
don't think so
um to the to nearly the same extent that
they would be in
north america there's a lot less of the
the idea that you would buy like a
detached house like most adults live in
uh
apartment buildings
which i think is is becoming a thing in
in canada at least but
in the cities but outside of that
i don't know just different i mean
there's a lot less real estate to go
around there for sure
yeah not not everybody in south korea
lives in the parasite house
if you were of the opinion that that
represented the average living situation
in uh
in south korea you're you're slightly
mistaken
that's it dude don't get me wrong like i
understood the message of parasite to
begin with
however the subtext of parasite was like
yo
that was a sick house
like the super text was like these
people
suck but then this and so does society
but the subtext was like damn
the house do be smacking though
okay let's see what we got going on in
here
dingle
no i haven't watched a minari yet i
don't know is it is it uh
like a paid video on demand sort of
thing i don't know if you if you live in
canada where is this available
i do want to watch it um gotta be in the
right uh
mindset for sure it's gonna move me to
tears
i watch amazon prime really it's on
prime video oh you
you can rent it on amazon
okay dude i might do that
if we get a chance this weekend
would you this is a good question it's a
very easy one for me to answer but
i'm sure there'll be some uh dissent
would you rather live in the parasite
house or the house from knives out
100 i'd rather live in that ultra modern
uh secluded house from parasite that's
in the middle of the city center but
also has some privacy
um
okay hold up hold up this is it it's not
quite good enough
you know what this is okay
i would consider this to be worth a try
at least early on
the knives out house has it's got a
bunch of stuff
you know going for it it's big it's got
secret passages and stuff like that
but uh i the parasite house is is
undefeated
that's the other thing i mean i get it
like if you lived in the house you would
have the means to keep it clean
but like the older i get the more i see
like big houses in media
the more i just look at it and go like
bro that's like a full-time job just to
keep that place from falling apart
i don't want that there's too much like
the house from paris is still pretty big
don't get me wrong but like
[Laughter]
the house from knives out i'm like dude
now i gotta i gotta become like a
like a ceo of my home just to
just to keep the place from being dusty
like that's that's hard
i don't think you know even in my
wildest dreams of opulence
i don't think i would ever want to live
in a place that requires like
daily staff that would like that's too
much
that's two bombs you know what give me
these give me these
you know what give me that yeah you
gotta use it man what about robot staff
that at that point i could be persuaded
i think if there was robot staff
i think i would get over it uh this is
just
bad that's pretty good though
okay we can work with that
i mean i'm not mad about flush i think
there's some value in getting a
a space bar item early and now we can
you know if we carve
or craft a space bar item that's worse
than this we never
have to use flush again or we never have
to use it we can just uh
cycle a penny and or something like that
turn it into something else
give it a try have the robot butler from
rocky iv
happy birthday paulie the robot
is gone no slide don't do it
she's out of here
yeah i don't like as a kid i remember in
like uh
get flushed i remember in um
fifth grade we had a uh
a project to like design our dream home
and everybody
did the same thing you know at that age
right and then there's on floor three
million
there's a a a ping pong table pool
that's not a bad item
hook me up man um
i'm not afraid anymore i shouldn't well
no i'm glad i picked that up actually
um but now like the older i get the more
i'm like
i don't want that you know i i mostly i
just want
a a tinier house in a better location
i'm happy where we are right now don't
get me wrong i'm just like you know
oh yeah okay so can i tell you what i
was wondering why everybody was going
question mark question mark question
mark
um
it's because i picked up an item
for a lot of hp that just gave me
consumables instead i literally traded
like two red heart containers for a
demon
heart not a wise play and i was
i i can't believe you know my initial
hunch was like what's chat talking about
they don't know what they're talking
about
i'm the isaac player here what did you
just say to me you little chatter
i'll have you know i graduated top of my
class from isaac academy
but then it turns out they were right
this time
[Laughter]
dream catcher is good by the way wrong
possibly the worst movie based on a
stephen king property ever made
truly almost an insulting film
actually wrong dream catcher is awful
exactly what did i tell you that's what
i told you dude maps pretty good
dark tower okay you know what i've not
seen it
dreamcatcher is really bad though like
this might have been from the original
book but there is a part in dreamcatcher
where um
a man like i think he poops out an alien
and then he's stuck on the toilet trying
to like hold it
in um while like his friend is
beating the door down like it's it's
just a total disaster
that's in the book all right dude this
it's pretty crazy so i'm going seven
coins in a spirit heart here you know
let's let's try it
i suppose we can just hold that and
cycle it out
it's really bad like the and the thing
is it's like um
it's played straight is the thing
if it was a comedy you might be like
that's funny like that's kind of like
a james gunn sort of sense of humor
there
um but that's not uh it's not the way
it's played in the movie in the movie
it's played like menacingly like oh i
hope he doesn't let the poop weasel get
out
what's your opinion on the movie casino
it's a good movie man
casino i i certify it good movie
give me a spirit heart please
i think it like it's not as
well liked as goodfellas but that
doesn't
mean it's bad man
still a good a good movie okay we're
almost there
we just need to swap out this red heart
for a key
heavy bad swap out the key
for this all right we should know by now
that that's portable slot okay let's
swap out the the coin for a pill
there's there's something to that don't
get me wrong
but perhaps
perhaps we can get
a spirit heart
you know what here's i gotta is an
honest opinion for you okay
getting seven coins is easy
so i am merely going to take the hp
that's available right now
and then start to rebuild to get to what
chat
has uh told me is alabaster box
because it's in we we can farm this hp
up pretty infinitely you know
seven coins in a pill is not a that's
not a hard recipe to come to
to come to pass
leave that behind for the time being
healthy donation machine you know it
cobalt i got
i got too good to use syndrome on my
donation machine
hey honestly just i i did that on
purpose i'm
like i i just want you to
die faster and our damage is really bad
so if you could just
get hit by the revenge fly i'm gonna be
a happy man
yeah this is this is quality of life
smart fly plays baby
are you gonna play turnip boy commits
tax evasion
so i bear told me i should play it
i also saw it on steam and
thought to myself that it might be worth
playing when i watched
the the kind of trailer on steam i i was
unsold by the end of it
but i may consider giving it a given a
try i've heard it's short which is oh
there's a lucky penny in there
hmm one moment please
lucky penny doesn't count as anything
different no wait that it does
this used to be portable slot but then
did okay hold on
box of spiders that's actually
substantially better than flush
which will all okay you mad genius
it's all coming together
we just need one more no we don't need
one more penny
so there's alabaster box you use that
which allows you to what okay
okay okay hold on which pays out with a
spearhead hard
and then you oh but my box of spiders is
gone now okay but that's fine
then we use alabaster box
it gives us seven seals okay so this is
how you endlessly farm up
special items i understand
to an extent and then dude let's go
we got a box of spiders back
heavy pog then we picked this up but it
doesn't give us anything
and i'm looking at and i'm like wait a
minute did we get wait
what was the point though
we just we just did nothing right we did
all that just to get nothing
you just keep farming the box over and
over but but every time you
okay like i'm obviously i'm missing
something i'm i'm okay with that
but like when you
endlessly farm the box to get more items
like doesn't the box just give you
you farm the box until you get to eight
spirit hearts which gives you mom's
knife
okay so all of this is just it's
collective engineering to get me to
create the most boring run of all time
is that is that the the joke here
yes okay well you know there we go now
now i know
i'm free from this prison and i will
instead just
do gaming and uh and we'll move on
it's also alabaster box is worse when
you take a deal with the devil
okay so that if you don't take deals
with the devil the alabaster box gives
you double the payout instead all right
well that's noted
it's quite a complicated troll
yeah just just relax i mean did you see
uh
i replied to it on twitter there was the
the comment from the the chess women's
grand master who said like you've
probably been backseated before but have
you ever been backseated like this
and then the uh the video was called
like my first time baking
and then the top comment was uh hey
great video just a few tips for you and
then it was like minimum
13 things on the list in an essay format
like
yes step 12 was like you know don't open
the oven to check on the cookies it
would be better to get
an oven that has a window on the front
of it and you're like okay so no
no problem first time baking cookies the
the constructive criticism that i have
for you
is uh buy a new oven really smart and
and good feedback
definitely feedback that was made to
help the person that made the video not
just to make yourself feel like you're
some kind of like authority on baking
cookies or something like that
anyway what i was gonna say is this is
nothing like that so don't sweat it
um moving on
i am going to play you one time
dude i'm gonna level with you i've i've
come to terms with aquarius not being so
bad
i've actually especially if you have no
damage i feel like creep is worth
something
just in general i think creeps better in
the game
we don't have a key okay now i'm gonna
blow you up
how about seven cents i picked that one
up
how about seven cents and then five
cents on top of it
oh that's right i forgot it synergizes
with your tear effects now
that's 13 cents i don't think so
that's right it's the square hole and
what do we do with the arch shape
that's right it goes into the square
hole
rainbow baby i i sleep on that
glaucoma tears honestly like insulting i
think i'd rather go back to to rainbow
baby but let's just hold this for a
moment
i think we're we're in this for the long
haul now this is not boss rush or hush
this is something completely different
golden razor i don't even know what it
does
this item does not exist in my brain
there's no entry for it whatsoever
it's very good
i feel like i'm taking crazy pills i'm
like don't tell me recipes they're like
nl here's one recipe by the way spoilers
it's alabaster box
i'm like hey what does this item do
they're like take it kappa
smiley face you'll see can you tell me
what it does
no you'll see
just wanna know don't don't make me all
tab don't oh my boneheart
don't turn me into a into a wiki user
man
that's all i ask
turns your money into damage for one
room
oh okay so it's a razor that takes money
instead of hp
that's uh that's interesting
i really don't want to get rid of boxes
spiders
but i do think boxes spiders does spit
out a spirit heart as well
oh i'm i'm living dangerous instead i'm
just gonna do what i always do
on tainted cane and uh exclusively take
hp upgrades until i get no damage
and then die due to no damage and then
complain you'll excuse me
um we're already there
we're gonna get there one of these days
you're going to give me some good items
like an eternal heart
and a dime okay now we're talking
give me this because i don't want to get
planetary i mean maybe planetariums give
you better consumables
i don't know to be honest a is glaucoma
um but
you know we're trying to just get like a
mass effect of consumables going here is
is my
my take on it
dude this as long as we're talking high
value
it's damage there's some damage we
turned an eternal heart and seven other
consumables into 0.58 damage there's
something to that
it's a heavy price to pay but there was
some value associated
thinking about playing return when it
comes out i might like to give it a try
you know i i i have
a i don't know if i would call it
deserve it
i have a degree of skepticism
surrounding
just about every 3d roguelite like i've
never played um a 3d roguelite that i
enjoyed
to to the same extent as like really
any 2d roguelike that i've lost my soul
to
i know you're going to say what about
risk of rain too no it's a constant
source of
friction between myself and chat i just
like i respect the game
i don't find it fun though like i
if if you're asking for my my
honest-to-goodness truth i'm not trying
to rain on anybody's parade but
my uh my experience with risk of rain
too and and to some extent honestly like
gunfire reborn
uh was that like while i was playing it
i was like by all accounts like on an
intellectual objective level like this
should be up my alley but i find myself
just kind of like
waiting for the time to pass so we can
play you know mini golf instead
which is not um you know
i mean before you get mad remember you
you you wanted to hear it
you know
just say the 3d rogue lights have have
never tickled my fancy to that
degree the closest one is going under
but i honestly think it's
like just cause like i don't like first
person shooters that that much
and and a lot of the 3d rogue lights
kind of take the
they take the form of either a a 3d
a third person shooter or a first person
shooter
neither one of which is uh of particular
interest to me
but return like it looks good people
have said
they've they've had a great time with it
like i don't i'm not suggesting that i
think it's gonna be
bad i'm more kind of setting the stage
that my own expectations
are kind of irrelevant because a lot of
the time when i play them i'm like oh
i'm excited to play and then when i uh
when i actually play it myself i'm like
i wish i was just playing isaac
just different strokes for different
folks but i'll probably give it a try
yeah
i don't even know what this is
little dumpy is bad it's an insult
it's a butt okay well you know what
not necessary then
my dude just purge slasher's keep from
his memory
like it's it's a pretty good game
i i had an okay time playing slasher's
keep for like
you know a few hours and then i kind of
started to have like not such a great
time when you got stuck in a mosquito
room
where you had no means to kill the
mosquito for like 10 minutes um
wiggles esquire thank you for the gifted
subs thank you
much appreciated
coins goodbye dad's key
it's not it's not all that we need the
spiders right now for like literally any
kind of damage
hey hey don't forget we got meat on the
last floor
we're not totally bereft of damage
anyway it was less like of a challenge
that was like please
you know fact check and and more of like
an honest uh
opinion i suppose like i've never really
played a a 3d roguelite
i i haven't a level of skepticism
towards 3d roguelites
and for that matter like 2d roguelites
as well
like sometimes people be like oh check
it out it's like isaac but you play as
like a bunny
and i'm like ah i'm not totally
[Laughter]
i'm i don't know just i don't i i don't
put
a lot of here we go again um
i don't put a lot of uh
value on the idea of like hey it's like
you know a new roguelite like
i'm that's probably a better way to
describe it okay
great new roguelites come out and i
think i think you're right on this one i
think this is the right time
great new roguelites
come out with like a certain degree of
regularity
but the average new roguelite that comes
out
is kind of just good to middling
you know everyone's gonna be like you
know what about hades what about
you know dead cells etc etc you're
missing like the
he can do it the like 30 other games
that
came out that you know only dan played
like i i don't i would
weirdly enough rogue lights are like the
exception that proves the rule
like i love variety in general in games
or in streaming at least but the more
roguelites i play the more i actually
just grow an appreciation for like the
the dozen or so that i i very much love
you know i think that's one where i'm
like the quality over quantity in that
one
for me is is tilted in like the opposite
direction of what it usually is
a lot of the times when i when i'm
playing like a a brand new rogue light
that's like a seven out of ten it just
makes me like appreciate the
the the eights to tens that uh that we
already have that much more
like i get wistful for for the game that
i've played
uh 6 000 hours of already
um
can you re-roll troll bombs this is
something like you should know at this
point
[Laughter]
i don't think you can reroll troll bombs
but you know let's give it a try let's
test it it's isaac mythbusters
definitely cannot um that's pretty good
though
hairpin is is helpful here
so that's that's more me setting the
stage like
um i would probably like i'll probably
check out
eternal i don't know like
it comes out so soon it comes out in
like a week
i might give it a segment and see how i
feel about it
it's one of those but like by all
accounts it should be up my alley
but i i need to give it a try before i
know for certain
yes trinkets can also sorry i was
looking at chat
trinkets can also not go in the sack and
neither can
troll bombs dude honestly whatever i'm
glad we got hit
revenge fly is is our mvp here we've
created our own train wreck
i don't feel i mean this is like who
cares but i don't feel like risk of rain
2 is underappreciated
i feel like it's it's got like
overwhelming you know positive reviews
on steam
everybody who plays it like evangelizes
it you know there were
streamers who played the game for like
you know
five digit concurrent viewers like i
think is well liked
be smart here start with key
not good enough replace coin with bomb
re-roll this garbage okay now we're
talking
replace bomb replace
red heart with nickel but we need
okay hold on this now we're cruising
not good enough but replace bomb with
other nickel
replace other bomb
with key
replace
key with coin
replace coin
with key take me back to mom's bracelet
replace pill with coin okay
i can live with this i can live with
this
it's something it's not great but it's
something
and then we just as tainted cain you got
to ignore that we should have ignored it
earlier but
mm-hmm oh it didn't even give us it
doesn't give us bombs
[Laughter]
i thought it gives you five bombs man
that's the whole reason i did it
and we're just just driving through
downtown
mausoleum right now begging for the
location of recipes through text
okay not a wise idea but on the other
hand
lucky penny dull razor we don't care
and if you don't care then we don't care
box spiders that's an all-time classic
um charge me up
please but why but why
like for what purpose yeah good good
point okay
i'm lost i'm lost in the sauce
that was an invisible enemy that enemy
came out of nowhere
very simple you know what it takes to
win this run
a mere can of corn
one simple can of corn and i'll be all
right
i believed fully you know what like
we gotta live i wish it weren't the case
but we must live so we'll go back to our
third box of spiders
i don't even want to think about like
how many consumables i've wasted just
flip-flopping back and forth here we got
a good setup here man we got a dime we
got a spirit heart in there like that's
that's nothing
insincere
i just i i cannot seem you know it's a
character this this character is going
to turn me into a brady games
power user it's the only explanation for
how we can proceed
is obviously just picking up random
random consumables and trying to make
them work
is is not the way you play
i want to make it work my way is that
much more satisfying but
uh we might have to accept that this is
uh
it's not the not the character for that
i'll take
that's a good take i'll take
i'll take
no you can't place trinkets in the bag
and
you also cannot um place troll bombs
into the bag
and you also cannot place
trinkets into the bag
it's a common question
you also cannot place the boss into the
bag although that would be pretty sick
uh i'm not locked out here with you
you're locked out here with me
did you put a 3d rogue light in the bag
for a dollar could you name a 3d
roguelite
i'm going into the cursed room man this
it's all turning around right here i'm
sick of being pushed around
what did i tell you
we should have picked that up for
certain
either way ice ice baby
the best familiar in the game possibly
now there's a chance it's your favorite
gimmick in the game in theory versus in
practice i mean this one's pretty close
to the top
[Laughter]
i really do like the idea a lot of uh
you know you craft your own items
i've realized like when you don't think
about it
you're like this is pretty sick when you
actually play it out in practice
the you know for most frictionless way
to win is to just you know
either exploit alabaster box or like you
know just
learn the recipes by heart and turn
every run into mom's knife
but um we got uh
we got a chance here we got a chance to
put our own
our own spin on this we just gotta never
take damage ever again
is there a rune in there no i
i saw something that didn't exist
yeah now if they had random recipes
now we'd be talking i need it i wish i
didn't but i do
give me the half one
let's grab something worthwhile here
he's learning how to bargain
[Laughter]
oh they have the same value okay that i
just didn't know
boy i sure hope somebody got fired for
that blunder um chrysalis
thank you for the gifted subs thank you
much appreciated this runs for you now
i'm leaving it all out on the table for
chrysalis
i'm doing it man we gotta swing for the
fences this fence was
not worth swinging for that's a that's a
lesson learned
i was hoping we would pick up uh
anything at all really
you haven't happened to see anything at
all have you
hey has levy replied to my ivana hump a
lot tweet yet might need some more
context for that
for anyone who didn't see the last
episode
just sounds like i'm i'm harassing oh i
am harassing him but not in a
not on an 18 plus variety
it's the mom fight dude i really don't
want to do the mom fight with this level
of hp
let's let's work on it here
it's just a simple friendly harass for
uh
for content
let me in dude i don't want to use my
bombs
it's true tinted skull could give me a
card
well it will give me a card
can't put trinkets
you can't put trinkets in the bag um
just something to something to think
about
[Laughter]
you gotta know when to hold them know
when to fold them
know when to walk away and know when to
run okay hold on
that was pretty great luck you're not
going to get that luck in every
circumstance
just taking a look this bag is
smacking it could start smacking in just
a second here
please
okay that's fine keys are not that good
replace a key with a coin just just the
cycle just the cycle okay
that something is not what we want but
it's something
it's actually good yeah but i'm like
okay fine i'm gonna do it
but like i
i just i i want to live through the mom
fight as well and i'm not
you know what we get to open this and
this is a little preview we can open it
in advance
good lesson learn there
every chest becomes an item with that um
debate on that one well except that one
okay hold on
i'm gonna buy the spirit heart to try to
stay alive
i i think i'm gonna buy
i mean there's something to trinket
smelter when there's so many trinkets on
the ground but
i think i'm gonna buy the blanket and
hope for um good consumables like i
we're in such a pinch right now i
i'm realizing we should have absolutely
i know it doesn't give us the item i
actually just wanted like good
consumables out of it
because i we need to craft something
that allows us to win
my my commitment to
massing items early in the game is very
that's my bad it's very foolhardy what
we should have been doing
is basically in the early game when
times are easy
don't settle for garbage keep fishing
for something incredible
i think that's the secret okay
stop that give me some spirit hearts i'm
gonna take one for now i'm gonna leave
the other one on the ground just in case
why do i keep don't do it again do it
again
yeah also definitely feel like angel
deals are the way to go
or at the very least don't give up to hp
to pick up uh spirit of the night for no
reason
okay surprisingly okay
this will actually give us something so
we're gonna take the negative for the
damage we're gonna suck up
the spirit heart i mean this this is
possible
revenge flies doing great stuff for us
as well we're still what is
how long has this run been going on
39 minutes okay
39 minutes to utero one not all of that
was just malaise trying to actually like
do damage to
enemies but failing some of that was
trying to farm up good items and failing
uh so there has been some variety there
but this is where it could improve
i'm going on a new principle okay my new
principle is only suck up good items
good consumables i should say everything
else
we just pick them up
it is not your tinnitus by the way that
is the vacuum cleaner don't don't freak
out
it's okay
just chill it's just a dyson
you're frozen thank you dude the freeze
is also like incredible defense
tinted rock
that hurts it hurts when you do that but
you know what
we got another nickel for the bag so
you're saying there's a chance
thank you sir i thank you
there's a temptation let's just see what
it makes
we don't take that's that's how you get
in trouble now you put coins here and
you get ready to cycle them out
if we have to we could take hp to
survive now we got a way out
watched moneyball yesterday really liked
it any other movie recommendations
if you if you liked moneyball this is me
pretending to be netflix
you just finished moneyball would you
like to watch austin powers gold member
sniped whatever what do we care we don't
want to deal with the devil anyway thank
you for protecting me for myself
the algorithm has decreed you like
vaguely intellectual movies starring
brad pitt have you considered watching
the big short
please leave a review
in the app store
this is workable this is this is
something you can hang your hat on
we'll take
that we're just sucking these up because
uh we could use the bomb honestly but
you know what like we
we're getting something we're we're
rebuilding
seven seven coins in a bomb is so easy
you know what while we're here i'm doing
it
[Laughter]
i'm doing it big short is a great movie
it's a fun movie
oh my
how to craft can of corn oil can
i mean at this point to to achieve some
degree
of of success on this run
i don't want to talk myself up but we
could probably get away with it
uh just having endless amounts of
hp upgrades
we probably have enough that if we can
get hp
we have enough damage to possibly make
it through
but i also don't remember what the
recipes are for hp
i just know if sometimes if you put a
lot of bad items and a couple good ones
together
you get something
bro like come on man
the problem with the netflix algorithm
is that uh
all people have bad taste
i mean i i can't disagree like if you
look at the charts
like the the top tens on netflix it'll
make you question your faith in humanity
like every david spade movie that comes
out is like number four
number one we put season two of grey's
anatomy on here
we don't have season one or season three
through eleven but season two is on the
top of the list right now
also do you remember that weird romantic
comedy starring uh
mila kunis that came out in 2013 for
some reason
that's the most popular movie on netflix
for four months running
nobody knows why one person in the
midwest
accidentally just left it on autoplay
and it's
we don't know how to stop it okay we are
one hit away from death
can't stop at this point
if i stop moving i will be hit can't
sleep clown will eat me
well
revenge fly please please oh god i
didn't know there were two still left
okay
still going still going this is bad we
don't even have we have no means to
generate hp for ourselves
and these enemies simply cannot be
dodged so good night gracie
literally just can't be done
[Laughter]
slash marker tainted kane



all right um we're back with repentance
obviously you know
by popular demand many people have
suggested at the time is right to play
tainted maggie i have
already played tainted maggie once very
recently
how about that so i know what's up
however how does tainted maggie work i'm
gonna teach you the uh
i'm gonna teach you what i know okay
okay what i did not know is that yum
heart heals you for two
[Laughter]
is that true i i just did literally like
a 40 minute maggie run
and i i never knew it it healed you for
two
anyway um it works a lot like tainted
keeper okay so as you kill enemies you
get red hearts
um but the the red hearts decay after
like a second
uh the thing is oh we'll we'll try it
uh the hp
you have below
or i should say above two
will decay over time whether it's
uh you know spirit hearts demon hearts
it don't matter
okay it's all decaying you also do give
uh dangerous hugs you can run into
uh enemies to hug them
and it does a lot of damage as you can
see for yourself
right here that's it yeah
just the case down to two so i i don't
know how you're supposed to build this
character what i will say is that
on sunday there's gonna be a heck of
we might as well we might as well lose
that hp up at the top here because we're
going to lose it anyway
let's go on uh on sunday there's going
to be a heck of an isaac run
um or a heck of a tainted maggie run i
should say you're
you know your head's going to explode
when you watch it i'm not going to spoil
you know good nor bad but just
just know for certain it's it's a wild
one for sure
um yeah
i mean obviously we take all i'm gonna
say
is that it involves perhaps one of the
lower
lowest percentage plays you're ever
gonna see in isaac
that's my take on that subject and
that's all that's the bottom line
because stone cold said so
please be a secret room that's fine
thanks for the two cents
getting a good pill that's a good joke i
like that joke
lowest percentage play oh you mean um
getting a damage upgrade at any point in
the entire run
stone cold is one of my favorite
wrestlers of all time
dude i stone cold is is kind of
inspirational right like
like i he's a wrestler i i'm not the
kind of guy who should be critiquing um
wrestling technique i suppose because i
don't know what makes someone's
you know someone sell good or bad or
what makes
like a flying head scissors or a frog
splash like look legit or whatever
the way i always thought about stone
cold though i mean obviously he's in
better shape than the average person but
he was just like
a normal guy that succeeded in the wwe
because of
an incredible amount of bravado and
charisma
but then also and you got to be careful
with this stuff
you got to you got to be careful with
this because you never know
but i'm under the impression as well
that stone cold steve austin
the man is actually like a cool guy
is that correct
like you would expect if
he was trying to think of the best way
to describe this yeah that's what i'm
saying he's based
right but in like the the good way
does a lot of charity work yeah it's
like he's so rude with his persona
but as a a genuine human being he seems
like
a nice guy like john cena right you'd
expect
well john cena's i guess he's kind of a
nice guy in the ring too but
you know you kind of expect given john
cena's like mr america
persona you know osama bin laden has
been compromised to a permanent end
you would you would expect that maybe uh
you know he's not based but it turns out
he's actually based
and transformer pill
i haven't seen him in years yo he's
everywhere amazing the new suicide squad
he was in bumblebee
he's been he was in the third fred movie
i think it was called camp fred
[Laughter]
um okay we're just we're moving on this
is not what i was hoping for but uh
is what i got
haven't seen him oh i get it because you
can't see me
i get it i understand yes i did um
i i received the reply finally and in
fact i received two replies from anthony
fantano
we built in a laboratory uh a
hermetically sealed
good take laboratory a take that got him
to respond on twitter it wasn't just to
get him to respond
it was also my genuine opinion
which was that bruce springsteen is
underrated by millennials and zoomers
and if
the whole steady released the song like
jungle land it would be the most revered
song since 2006's
all my friends by lcd sound system
he hit me with the the laughing emoji
and i believe he said what even is the
impetus for this take to which i
informed him
and then he made a joke about uh tame
impala which i must admit i did not
understand but i clicked the heart
button on it nonetheless
because hey i've heard of the bantam
impala
and sometimes youtube music is like hey
you've been listening to a lot of built
to spill
maybe you'd also like this band tame
impala and i'm like know your place
trash
just play more built to spill
i know if i wanted to listen to new
music i'd turn on the radio okay
anyway that's all i got this runs kind
of like uninspiring for right now but
we're gonna have a chance to get there
at some point you know it
the thing is i i don't want to throw
away my devil deal chances like right
now
otherwise i'd be walking into enemies
like left right and center but
you would you would probably know their
song elephant okay
is that the one that goes oh wow
you know what i'm talking about
temporary hearts don't lose your devil
deal chance yeah but i don't want to
lose my demon hard
maybe maybe that's short-sighted i don't
know maybe i'm clinging to to a vestige
of an earlier time
that's cannonball by the breeders yo 500
points to gryffindor
you absolutely got it
do you know the one that's like the less
i know the better
is that the one that goes i've been
waiting on you
seasons change i get some
not to think a bit
that's not okay that's another one
youtube music plays for me from time to
time
that's seasons by future islands future
islands tame impala not the same band
good to know
good to know
stop talking about the lightning and the
thunder dude it's already stuck in my
head
i am not familiar with the words of the
wiggles classic song
fruit salad yummy yummy but i am
familiar with the band the wiggles they
were like one direction but
uh for people that are like five years
younger than me instead of 10 years
younger than me
i think i'm i'm not joking the wiggles
are australia's biggest export
um you know
i bet that's not true i bet it's
something crazy like you know eucalyptus
some can somebody google what
australia's biggest export to the united
states of america is
i'd love to know that's an interesting
question
copper how about that
iron ore yeah c macros
it's not the wiggles
bet you feel silly right now
with your with your very serious take
and l are you part of the super stonk
community on reddit we're trying to
squeeze the hedge funds before they exit
their short ladder
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
i have
i have absolutely no no i i
look let's not even but what it
anyway i don't know what those words
mean
is all i'm trying to say yo this is
incredible eats maybe hold on i'm off
i'm not even reading chat because chad's
just gonna tell me not to do it let's do
it
this will be funny
yeah i don't buy those big time stocks
i'm i'm more of like a i
i mostly troll the pink sheets
if you know what i mean
not true by the way but anyway um
get me out of here i can't believe i got
the d10 dude
what what a waste petition to remove
this item from the game
and have levar burden host jeopardy
petition granted okay so now here's my
new game plan
as soon as we encounter a room that has
enemies
we walk into them a lot in order to
generate infinite amounts of money okay
we've encountered
enemies that are immune to being run
into
i didn't i didn't plan for that but
either way do infinite amounts of fiscal
capital
i mean that is really strong
and also we're getting freaking rich man
but i could use you know like something
like ramming speed maybe we actually
have finally the world's first use case
for ramming speed
i do have to let you know by the way
it's a modest spoiler
uh but i have beaten boss rush as this
character
but i have not beaten hush so we don't
have to
uh we don't have to put in a super rush
but it's a character that's like it's
kind of hard to go slow with
when i was playing as them earlier i was
like dude this is a great
time because now people are always like
please backtrack please i'm begging you
it's my last wish
but now i have a great excuse not to
backtrack
because if i backtrack
we lose these uh we lose our ability to
get the hush man we gotta we gotta go
faster than that
and it's pretty sizable damage yeah i
don't think i need to run away from
enemies i think i need to stay in there
and and
embrace the invincibility
okay
yeah yeah you want to get two hits per
instead of one hit per that's the secret
i finished eight tinted post-it notes
and i'm not gonna touch maggie because
of this mechanic
i i implore you to reconsider um
tainted maggie so far has been a lot of
has been a lot of fun
it's a little you know i i i say this as
somebody who's literally done like two
runs
it's not as much of a puzzle as like
some of the other characters for sure
like it's a little bit on the easy side
maybe
from what i can tell so far but it's uh
it's it's fun nl did you ever skip class
with malf
i have said this okay and this is not a
flex because i made up for it in
in university but it's the
honest-to-goodness truth
i uh literally i gotta take the book
back what was i thinking
um i literally never skipped a single
class in high school
and now you're gonna because i'm
questioning my own memory now i know i
didn't skip a class
but then you're like what about that day
that you were gonna skip class to go to
the beach
but it rained and thus you didn't have
to go to the beach and instead you just
went to your friend's house
house and watched uh batman begins i'm
thinking in my memory that that was
actually a half day
and we weren't gonna skip school i think
we only went for the morning that day
that i may have may have accidentally
misremembered it
combined with some kind of senior skip
day
revisionist history but i never skipped
a class in high school
i did it was only requested one time
um i i was i wasn't friends with the
skippers
however
one time uh in 12th grade an
acquaintance of mine
was like hey do you want to skip class
and go to the movie theater and watch
date movie to which i said
nah i'm good and then that's the
why not dude that's the end of that
and i think i made the right choice
i mean if you skip class to like go on a
field trip or something that's a
different story
that's not skipping yeah that's just i
mean if you consider that skipping
you're probably and i hate to say this
but it's true
you're probably like a bigger nerd than
i am
and i um competed in a scrabble
tournament
locally when i was nine years old so
that's tough that's a that's a tough bar
to clear
oh dude i forgot i got too busy this
morning i had a great tweet for levy
i was gonna tweet levy and say hey can
you please do
uh a chess analysis of austin powers
versus ivana hump a lot and then in
brackets it was gonna say
uh the year 2000 or 2001 which is when
the spy who shagged me came out okay
hold on hold on i
i'm sorry youtube this tweet has to be
sent
hey levy oh i didn't even
add him can you
do an analysis of
the classic 2000 game
of the classic chess match
powers the hump a lot
2000 there's a lot of
a very bold moves made and it could
use your tactician's
insight and then you gotta find a
screenshot
austin powers ivana hump
balot chess and then there should be a
screenshot
oh that's a perfect screenshot and then
we're just going to copy that in there
that that tweet is oh yeah this is doing
numbers
[Laughter]
oh this is doing numbers okay
anyway i'm back sorry that it's from
1999
whatever man
america 1999 is like canada 2000.
yeah i really want to see his uh his
analysis of the part
where they treat the pieces as if
they're nipples
i'm pretty sure austin powers opens with
something like
it's like knight to
like e6 or something like that
it's a very powerful opening it gives
you incredible control of the center
it forks a queen and a bishop you can be
taken with a pawn but
you know so be it what if they don't
take you esports oh hello daniel
daniel what did you you you had a
washout run or something like that i'm
not used to getting raided 20 minutes
after
my stream starts what happened
e sports esports thank you for the raid
daniel thank you
i think uh i think soy milk was not the
move here
i'm just gonna be honest i didn't
realize soy milk would also impact our
our contact damage but here we are
we're gonna be here for a bit but that's
okay
need to rest before 11 p.m et esports
i have no idea what that means is is
daniel um
see participating in another tarkov
tournament
he has a sponsored thing from 11 p.m to
6 a.m
eastern time
are you okay i didn't mean to buy that
key
sponsored summoner's war tournament from
11 p.m
to 6 a.m eastern time
oh my god
so congratulations are in order
that is so pog so yeah
i'm thinking i'm pogged well daniel um
i wish you the best in that it's prime
time vancouver time
i guess it does start at like 8 p.m i
i'm awake for a little bit of that
i have no idea what i'll be looking for
when i watch but i might be around we'll
see
we'll see dude this run is like this is
garbage
i did it to myself
yoink nice try yoink i almost got me
boy boys in it too dan are you competing
or are you uh
are you like part of the talent side
well this is interesting
you're competing yeah i'm going
head-to-head
against boy boy dude it's not fair like
i'll just go ahead and say it
you always end up you know you do any
esports event on
on twitch you always end up going
head-to-head with like somebody that was
like a literal esports athlete
before they turned into like a variety
streamer
it's not fair man champions of fire one
got i mean i lost the cobalt but then
you know
people get the cobalt got bodied by box
box in the finals like what are you
supposed to do right
it's box box he's he's got an incredible
eye for systems
um champions of fire too i got body by
hafu
and then hafu got beaten by yasuo like
you you can't compete with these uh
these people who eventually or like
previously at one point in their life
their whole you know job
they their career was being like the
best in the world at
dissecting a game systems and how to
exploit them to their advantage like
anyway so i guess what i'm saying is
good luck
[Laughter]
it's it's a different uh it's a
different flavor of gamer let's put
it that way but
i'm rooting for you regardless
this is a full health pill man i'm just
gonna hold it for now
big brother though look i'm not gonna
deny
uh that dan put on an incredibly
impressive show
on big brother here's what i'll say okay
i think that
dan probably could have played
40 lighter in big brother and still won
easily
i don't feel like when it comes to big
brother i don't i don't feel like
they're sending
the best competition
that's just my take from from watching
the edits
on youtube
i mean i feel like and you know
i apologize here but i feel like
uh like i've i've
people went harder for uh the checkpoint
league where there was no prize money on
the line
than they did for um
big brother with with a couple of
exceptions admittedly
put egg in a room with memphis and frank
and see if he walks out alive
i don't think i would be good on this
show i think i would just be bored to be
honest
i think i would welcome being being
removed from the premises
anyway that's all i got yeah i don't
think
i'm good at like um
putting on airs when people are annoying
i think i wear it on my sleeve too much
okay yeah we're good we're out of here
um you put on airs for chad all the time
yeah now and then sometimes sometimes
yes sometimes no
okay like okay we learned a very
valuable lesson on this run and it we're
soon to
perish here um if you're doing tainted
maggie
just don't don't don't just don't take
soy milk
it's not necessary just don't do it
that being said i think you know if if
we don't
uh do contact damage anymore i actually
feel like our dps is pretty sec
i do see the tinted skull but
we don't need it pretty sick you might
have bet coins
hp please
where we're going we don't need tinted
skulls although
if we're not gonna make it the hush
anyway there is a chance we could
actually need tinted skulls i suppose
right you can never blow this guy up
he always gives spiders that's that's
old intel i apologize
my mistake
is there any nft you would actually buy
um
i'm not i'm not like an investor i'm
more of a collector
so for me personally like as you know
i'm big into the crash bandicoot scene
so i already have
crash bandicoot uh on the run figurine
number 29 of 65 holding the blue hyena
uh it's blue hyena crash holding the
wampa fruit
if you possess 1 through 28 or 30
through 65
please get in touch with me in my
business inbox i just want to talk
i have a but i you can't listen to what
i'm about to say
i think they're gonna go to the moon i i
think they're
i don't see how they couldn't first off
limited supply
full resin statue looks to be about six
inches tall don't ask me how i know that
i'm willing to pay conservatively
eight figures per crash bandicoot statue
they must be certified they must have
the original
proof of purchase signed by bobby kodek
himself
and then the other thing is when i said
four fate when i said eight figures
what i meant is two figures with six
decimal places
as long and we're talking low we're
talking like like 11 12 bucks
but if if you're willing to
interface on those terms please
contact my my ombudsman and fiduciary
manager
at the business inbox thank you
i should take it to pawn stars that
would be great
i just picture walking in and the guy's
like holy crap is that
blue hyena crash holding the wump of
fruit number 29 of 65
where did you get this fell off a truck
they would put me on the broadcast
because it's a great story
i got paid by activision to play the new
crash bandicoot while wearing crash
bandicoot's real hands
is pawn stars even on the air anymore
i have no idea
i have no clue
didn't one of them go to prison yeah i
think chumley went to prison for a
little bit
and the the uh the patriarch of the
family
also passed away um
well there goes my emperor card i guess
um that was black rune huh
what did he go to prison for you know it
was like uh
hardcore pawning
great great damage there
he poned them yeah exactly get pwned
excuse me uh chum lee from pawn stars
you're accused of of hardcore poning
how do you plead oh i gotta talk to my
law guy first
mmm best i can do is no contest
a ponzi scheme yo there you go you know
and again i apologize this is like
investing adjacent there's there's so
bernie madoff died
um last week you know i don't want to
say like rip to a legends he ran like uh
you know the largest ponzi scheme in in
history i guess uh
next to dogecoin but um i was listening
to a podcast about it and they were they
were
i don't want to say laughing because
that'll give the wrong message but they
were just musing on it and they're like
you know
because of the fact like when when
bernie madoff got uh
busted over the next decade they managed
to recover about like 80 percent
of what investors lost and then return
it to the investors
because he got busted in late 2008
which is actually like the middle of the
financial crisis
for some of the investors it was
actually fortuitous
that they were part of the ponzi scheme
because they only lost in the end 20
of their investment instead of uh
like the i don't know 40 to 60 percent
they would they would have lost in the
market at the time
which is just uh you know just
just humorous you know fate fate has a
sense of humor i suppose
my friend thought you were tim the
tatman congrats
i have no comment on that thing i'm just
merely gonna say thank you
watch me on youtube i make many warzone
videos and have a
dent in my head
i have a dent in my head from the
headphones
and i have a famous clip in which i fell
off my chair
or maybe the chair broke i can't
remember
that's t1 no t1 is the guy who
he has the clip of him holding the his
dinner up to the camera and then it
slides off the plate and then
lands on the floor oh man
that's a good one i don't i don't care
if it was clip farmed that's a classic
video
i see it reposted like maybe once every
uh
once every three or four months and it's
like you know
girls men don't know real pain
men when they see this video or whatever
anyway
who's the guy who sings pay phone i
actually don't know but that's an
all-time clip
that's all i got
anyway can we come on man
stop putting on airs so i'm i'm
realizing you know what i said like we
were definitely gonna die and lose
we're not gonna die and lose we're
actually gonna win easily
we're just not going to do it in the
traditional way
um what did i did i take polaroid i took
negative let's go
thank you brain so we can do dark path
we can accomplish something on this run
we're not going to be able to fight hush
but that's that's just life baby
imagine being so rich and bored you make
a ponzi scheme
yo ponzi schemes are crazy though like
and it's just the human mind is like
very easy to exploit i think
if you're like a bad actor and because
here's
i'm trying to think of the way to frame
this there was this blog i was reading
and the whole thing that the guy did on
the blog was exposed ponzi schemes
so there's this british um
i'm just gonna call it a scam but i
don't remember the name
um and basically what they tell you is
like hey you buy in at like the bronze
tier or the silver tier of the gold tier
for like 500 to 2
000 um and what
they claim to do which is not
conceivable is they take your original
investment and then they they invest it
in
like a high frequency foreign exchange
trading and then they pay you
five percent of your original investment
per week which you know
it maybe doesn't seem too insane
until you realize that like you know the
average return from like the stock
market is like eight percent per year or
something historically
then they're giving you five percent a
week
anyway so this guy wrote a whole blog
post explaining about how like
it's literally inconceivable and he
called like the companies that were
supposed to be involved with it and they
don't actually exist
they're like storage lockers in in the
seychelles and stuff like that
um but
the the blog post has like
i don't know like 5 000 comments on it
and all of the comments are from people
that are like
hey buddy like i don't know what your
problem is with this but how could it be
a scam
i gave them a thousand bucks uh two
years ago
and they've already given me like
5 000 bucks in return
and you're like like they're actually
mad that this guy's like trying to
expose this obvious scam because they're
like
it's it actually works and you realize
like that's like the crazy thing about a
ponzi scheme man
a ponzi scheme like if you're early it
kind of owns
[Laughter]
it's like the greatest investment you
could ever ask for
if you're late it freaking sucks and you
lose everything
because it's all you know castles in the
sky you know it's not based on
anything in reality except getting
future customers
but like if you're if you're in the
first like 25 percent of the people that
invest in a ponzi scheme you're laughing
all the way to the bank
no wonder they're out there trying to
like uh
you know convince other people to to get
in and also like anybody who threatens
to
expose it they're like they're like okay
well the real stock market returned
eight percent i've already made a
thousand percent on my investment in
this thing
you tell me what's the scam and i'm like
well the
the one that is just using future
investors money to
pay out your original uh
deposit i guess but like i understand
where you're coming from
so i've come to terms with the fact that
actually i think ponzi schemes own
you just have to be early
[Laughter]
forget delirium
or right yeah if you run them well no
because i think if you run them you're
screwed right because then you go to
jail
this is by the way for the purposes of
this bit this is satire
i would never run a ponzi scheme first
off it's unethical
secondly i'm like way too lazy and
that's just sincere
why would i run a ponzi scheme when i
can just be paid to play isaac and
banter about nothing right occam's razor
um so as long as you don't
as long as you keep twitch running no
ponzi schemes there's a little carrot on
a stick for you
but then secondarily like it's unethical
of course
but um i think if you run the ponzi
scheme though that's mighty
dangerous because you could go to prison
for 180 years
like bernie madoff did however if you're
like the third person
to get invested in a ponzi scheme and
you just happen to be in the right place
at the right time
i bet there's and it's modestly
controversial a lot of people lost a lot
of money in that bernie madoff stuff but
as someone who did not have skin in the
game
i'd like to think it's been long enough
that we could all joke about it now um
i bet there were some people who were
like oh man
they sent bernie to jail huh he did that
guy he did amazing he made my money go
10x in five years
the government's always trying to keep
the always trying to keep the little guy
down
anyway that's my thoughts on bernie
madoff
i do want us when i said rip to a legend
what i meant was
now hold on now under no circumstances
do you have to hand it to him i'm just
saying
watch the actual documentary nobody won
in the end
all right well you probably got me there
but in my head it was a good bit at
least
okay dark room baby dark room frick yeah
made off sell was nicer than my dorm
room yeah but you got to think of it
like the taxpayer was paying a lot more
for madoff sell than they were paying
for your dorm room so you get what you
pay for
um okay hold on i mean like this is very
good
no question there the streamer room
um i mean we don't need a ton of hp
i wonder if ma of the void will just
charge itself
with marked i think i just say
no i think i just
enjoy my life
my dorm room cost 850 bucks a month and
it was
19 square feet that's no okay
it look i believe it was small
i do not believe that it was 19 square
feet
it was 6 feet by three feet i don't
believe that i
trust me i've
my dorm room is quite small as well
but 19 square feet so it's like
literally like if you
are over six feet tall it's impossible
to lay down if you lay down your feet
would be poking out of the door
yeah i don't think they put you i think
they put you in the
in the dorm room i think that's like the
broom closet
19 square meters still pretty small
i suppose that's true it could have been
19 by one i guess
when you put it that way it's not so bad
you just got to turn sideways to get in
and then stay sideways the whole time
you're inside but
and you also definitely could not sit
down
or if you if you sat down you 100 would
never be able to stand up ever again but
hey for the right kind of self-starter
it's a great opportunity
unique living situation
in the east village
there's a couple like uh games reporters
i follow on twitter and
i guess one of them is like apartment
shopping in new york right now and and
some of the listings that they post are
so good
there's one where like the fridge and
the oven
are uh on like a
corner together but facing out so like
you literally can't open
either the fridge door or the oven door
like the way it was set up you'd
actually have to like move your fridge
out of the way in order to be able to
open your oven door
and you're just like just get rid of the
oven man like i
in the fridge we've been through this
before the fridge is much more important
than the oven
at that point you don't advertise the
oven just yeah you buy him an air fryer
or something come on
it's the perfect situation oh ho ho baby
what were they thinking
who made this
there was kate's been watching some like
apartment videos on
uh youtube as well and some of them are
crazy like
there's this apartment in korea where
like
it's incredibly small it's not 19 square
feet but it's it's very very tiny
and it's not meant to be a dorm room
it's meant to be like a place where you
could live
perhaps even if you got lucky like with
another human being
when you walk in where you would
normally maybe like put your shoes or
something like that
there was just the toilet like with no
door
no no nothing there was just literally
like the toilet
sitting right there i
like with no privacy curtain whatsoever
so like if you were pooping
your front door could not open which i
guess is kind of a security measure
but it might be a little awkward you
know if your partner's coming home from
work or something like that
don't don't hit me three times
yeah it's like an apartment that
basically i designed okay that was
that was a solid run all things
considered
i can't be too mad about that one
considering we threw it with soy milk
like we did some good stuff there
but we need light path and hush that's
it light path and hush and then we'd
have the whole post-it note unlocked
there oh my god
slash marker
6



all right i'm the baby gotta love me
great show great show dinosaurs it's a
great show
you know what i dude we've been kind of
vibing
what if we did some stuff is the lost
man as the tainted lost
take this tainted lost and learn to fly
again learn to live so free
it's this is like the best item you
could ever ask for am i
isn't this i'm i'm cracked
don't okay you you can get hit well i'd
rather not but
we still have holy card i think we just
we check and then we leave because we
still got our mantle ability
okay i mean this is so glowing hourglass
means if you get hit once you just you
you turn back time
and then you're good to go
you still got your holy charge and your
love and life
and it should not convert to the regular
hourglass that's antiquated information
i've been told
so we really should be able to lean into
this although it is it's a three-room
charge
is it has it always been a three-room
charge or does it take more charges as
time goes on
it used to be they nerfed that it used
to be two okay
it's still an item that i used to know
but you didn't need to nerf
them all scout the wiki for the items
that'll win you the run
some some eddie
now you're just some eddie that i use
i'll certify that in in my world that's
a certified bop
i've never listened to it um outside of
the radio but it's mostly because i've
never had to listen to it outside of the
radio
because it's always on the radio
certified fresh it doesn't get the
the critic's choice but i'll definitely
certify it fresh no question there
that's a nice high note are you guys
familiar with the the twitter charlatan
who's like
hey check out how good my friend is at
hitting this note
and then he they go like hey tom hit the
note and he goes
somebody that i used to know but it's
literally just the song
like the the recording of gotye singing
it
and everyone in the comments is like
he's so
good dude anyway sorry
i have a law that i want to pass
as long as mask mandates are still
in effect grocery stores should not be
allowed to play music
[Applause]
every time i go to the grocery store i
got a mask on
the cashier has a mask on i walk up to
the cash register
and all i hear is
and i just go not bad
and then they go from open pooper and i
go on i have my own bags
and then they go shmurp and i go
on debit and then they go how's your day
and i'm like oh that's what you were
trying to say
anyway that's that's my that's my bit
that's the whole bit
but it's true
get bodied oh no my cards
whatever i'm out of here i don't need
the money i'm going back in to get the
money but not change it this time
let me get my hold on let me
let me get my hourglass back just in
case
one time i was talking to the cashier
and they couldn't understand me
they took off their mask to hear me
better that's you know the human brain
is
is a very interesting thing
[Laughter]
it's the electrical inference that's
what i'm always talking about man people
keep dunking on me for saying electrical
inference
no i had a situation because like i i
was at the grocery store i put all my
stuff
on the like counter for checkout and
then the lady
was like and i was like i'm gonna debit
please
and then she just like rung me up right
like she activated the credit card
machine um and then i went to leave
and i picked up the sparkling water and
she was like oh
so that is yours and i was like yeah and
she's like
i asked you whether or not that was
yours
and you just said i you know and i was
like yeah it's mine
like
i was kind of like haha but i was also a
little bit like dan's game
hey new bosses new bosses just dropped
like the dan's game in me was like you
know
what do you think it was like the
sparkling water fairy just came by and
was like
this will get him good
self checkout is a thing but it it it's
not
universal in all grocery stores
see ya
i'm like hold on
son of a
i don't know what i'm supposed to do
there
maybe it's not worth it maybe it's like
just lesson learned you know
maybe the cards are but there's money in
there man there's there's a two of
diamonds in there
i've got to turn the music down in my
car to park correctly
i try to like honestly i've been saying
it i've been beating this drum
nobody's really disagreed but just to
illustrate a point like
when i am playing isaac
the baby at least for youtube the baby's
making a lot of noise in the background
and it just it inhibits the ability to
play just slightly
it's okay like it's you know i'm not
upset by it or anything like that it's
just it is what it is
but uh it's like sensory overload like
just
that amount of noise in the background
is like you know your brain is still
processing it you know it's still using
a little bit of its bandwidth to
to process it so you you know it has an
impact on your concentration for sure
i think we just take of babylon it
should just it should just be great
what a horrible night to have a curse
it's true yeah i feel like baby noises
are also like
they're even more distracting as well
because
it's like the brains way of being like
you know you i mean let me put it this
way you got to pay attention to every
single one of them
because like sometimes they're like and
sometimes they're like
and you're like i then you look and
you're like what's wrong and then she's
just like i
swallowed my spit the wrong way haha
daddy got you
you thought i was in danger instead i'm
just learning
how to be a human being and all that
dude this damage is like insane
two of clubs no sweat can of corn can of
corn can of corn
okay you use two of diamonds i know it
seems like an inopportune time hold on
you do this
no you don't use two of diamonds i was
gonna say you use it so that you can
take ace of hearts with you
it does give you one extra room that you
can just wipe out for yourself
but one extra room being wiped is not
worth the potential
the potential money and we don't even
want this yet but we'll save it for a
rainy day
great uh underrated um classic rock song
by the way
you know that one you better
save it for a rainy day you know that
one
no i'm hip i'm with it i'm not owned i'm
not owned
twitch wanted me to change my chat icons
i will never
rocking that um the overwatch league
badge
what's old is new again did you see the
new balenciaga
uh catalog i was added on twitter
because i've been talking about this day
coming for years
uh it's matrix fashion
it's like long leather trench coat and
then jp's glasses from grandma's boy
i knew the day would come so it starts
with
the the balenciagas and then it gets
ripped off by h
m and then before you know it you're
walking down the street and everybody's
like ready steady
go
um but anyway from living in
vancouver i will tell you
vancouver grizzlies gear is popping off
like crazy down here
probably in the early 2000s i bet you
would never be caught dead wearing it
and that's for no reason whatsoever kind
of reminds me of your overwatch league
badge
right now it might seem a little
embarrassing but what's embarrassing in
a contemporary fashion oftentimes
becomes cool in a retro fashion
would you agree with that assessment jay
you can you can meme on the grizzlies i
wasn't here for that uh
i wasn't in vancouver for that honestly
i mean it's one of those things where
like
you know usually when a team moves
there's
there's like a narrative where
uh like oh they never gave us a chance
or something like that
everything i've ever heard about the
grizzlies is that they were
bad the entire time they were here and
also
attendance was horrible like amongst the
lowest in the league
so i'm kind of like what do you expect
man
sounds like they took our toy and they
gave it to a kid who wanted it more
i can't be i mean you would be annoyed
if you were a basketball fan in
vancouver for sure i'm just saying like
you know you can kind of understand it
just doing a little bit of the thinking
here
feel like the pacers are the team nobody
talks about
i mean there's a few nba teams i always
forget about
one of them is um
they've recently started being good
right but for a while
i had i just completely forgot the
timberwolves existed
there were like 15 years where they
especially when they didn't have kevin
durant i was just like i have
i have no memory that they that they oh
you know what i'm thinking of the bucks
yeah the bucks are good now it's the
timberwolves are still bad
my mistake um
okay we're gonna do it
not kevin durant sorry kevin garnett kg
i forgot what i was talking about
indiana pacers i remember but only
because they were like cool in
in the 90s i forget about the sacramento
kings a lot
for sure there's got to be more
that i that i'd never remember
see you i'm also like i i just uh
like this is mostly because i don't
follow basketball
um but i got really confused
surrounding the hornets and pelicans
situation
like the hornets left and became they
went to new orleans and became the
pelicans
or the thunder i can't remember and then
they
then the hornets came back
something like this um i mean out of
these i think that's better
fly away pelicans pelicans and the
thunder
feel the pelicans and the thunder
where are we at on this trunks we want
to do boss rush geez louise man
that's tough pelicans and the thunder
hornets went to new orleans became the
pelicans
supersonics went to oklahoma and became
the thunder
okay but then who who became the new
hornets
the bobcats okay but the bobcats were
they were an expansion so here's okay
here's my timeline in my head
charlotte hornets existed in the 90s at
some point
they moved to new orleans
after the move to new orleans
they got another team
called the bobcats
and then they were like now we're the
hornets again
i'm thinking about the trinket it's just
it's a tough timeline but
i i guess it's similar in the part of me
in like the nhl because like in the nhl
there used to be uh
there was a team called the atlanta
flames they moved to calgary
in like the 1970s maybe the 1980s i
can't remember
um and became the calgary flames but
then like
in the year 1998 atlanta got another
team
they were the atlanta thrashers then the
atlanta thrashers got
relocated to winnipeg and became the
winnipeg jets
but winnipeg also used to have a team
called the jets that in like 1996
got relocated to phoenix and they're now
the arizona coyotes so like
it's there's there's some confusion good
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
so true
anyway sports baby uh
it should just be so much easier in like
in british football
where you know every team is just called
you know watford fc
bart bernsmith fc and then you never
know what league they're in
because if you come in 16th place you
get relegated back to junior high school
i'm not messing around dad relegation's
actually pretty sick
there is no pepe silvia
at least the system in the uk is merit
based
uh doesn't the british premier league
like not have a salary cap
doesn't seem to merit based to me isn't
it like the same five teams
uh at the top of the league like every
single year except for that one year
that lester
leicester city won
hey man it's just a merit-based system
where the poorest teams consistently
lose and then get relegated down to the
uh
the championship where they make like 1
18th as much money as they did when they
came 18th in the premier league
okay hold on we gotta make boss rush
we're a little bit
hold on hold on and now don't don't open
the
don't open the football can of worms
yeah what's going on with this super
league stuff
i saw like that they day
no no no yes yes yes
i saw that they announced it and then
like a day later they were like
oh you believe that
i feel like it's one of those things
where like i mean if you don't support
the super league
you're just like a i'm just gonna say it
you're like a corporate bootlicker right
like if you're if you're a fan aren't
you like sick more soccer
no you got it exactly the opposite
really
i could use a tears upgrade keep this
lock moving
okay educate me educate me
oh okay they tried all eyes okay
here's how i thought it worked i thought
they were like hey fifa and like uefa
are like pretty corrupt so we're gonna
make our own cool guy
soccer league and then fifa and uefa
were like
hey if you do that like you're gonna
wake up with like a
a horse head next to your uh next to
your pillow in the morning
and they said just kidding we were just
pretending to see if you were interested
but no they were actually like oh we're
not making enough
money with the current system so we're
going to
we're going to develop okay you see that
i'm
unaware of the situation when i when i
saw the news about it i was like pog
more soccer is basically what my my
brain did because i'm also predisposed
to think that fifa and uefa are the bad
guys because
like isn't fifa like one of the most
corrupt
sports organizations and it's like la
cosa nostra
usually they are but this time is
different the more you know man the more
you know
okay look don't even worry about it
we're gonna
there's ways out of this okay
probably battery battery charge
i knew it
third time's a charm baby
and there's a dude we could do that like
infinitely as long as we don't die there
okay but we're still trying to make boss
rush and we're
freaking hella slow
like chloe would say in
uh life is strange my favorite game of
all time
this is indeed tainted lost
another successful clip has been farmed
try posting that one on
livestream fails streamer
makes a mistake and then hyper specific
thing happens that makes it uranus
oh sorry oh secret rooms give you uh
you you see the secret rooms and secret
rooms give you stats okay see he's
remembering items here
this we're cracked man like we're
it's a new era for remembering things
oh god blessed greed
it's not that bad also you get even more
secret rooms
that i did not know
okay if we're gonna do boss rush we
gotta we gotta get the freaking lead out
man
we we could probably explore more of
this floor
next floor we might just have to let it
fly
tier size i don't see how that could
possibly backfire
we don't care for this
17 30. we got to go we got to go to the
next floor
it has to be done
no chance without emperor okay um
prop bets please
chatter thinks that there is no chance
without the emperor card
yeah okay i respect that mods you don't
you don't have to start the prop best
that's fine
another tears upgrade that's the same
as the last tier's upgrade we just got
i give him three to one without emperor
i mean honest i would i would
i tell you when not to bet on me i would
bet on myself here for sure
the upgrade only lasts for a floor
what a rip dude
it's a resettable tears upgrade
more like a forgettable tears upgrade
that's right i said it you do get a
spirit heart as well
this is where i'd put my spirit hard if
i had one
that's gonna that's gonna put a damper
on things
battery charge not this time
hmm
sorry you go to the shop you get a holy
card
go to the shop you get a holy card
go to go to your secret room get another
nice tears upgrade
well okay we made it but this is like
i'm glad we didn't do the prop bet
because that would be controversial
because we have to go try to find the
shop
in order to stand any chance that's
unfortunate
okay so it's pretty easy
um you just gotta not
pain slash marker pain
all right we're running back another
another tainted last run last one was
cursed from the start
never stood a chance
look i'm way less annoyed by the death
that we just had
than uh than many of the deaths
yesterday which largely just came due to
not having uh
any damage whatsoever that one at least
there's like there's some hilarious uh
hilarious discourse
jay by the way i can't watch i i washed
out of uh
of the show
the game forced me to take a poison pill
and the poison pill
is if you want to play this game you
can't sit comfortably on your couch you
have to lean
so far forward that the screen is like
an inch in front of your face otherwise
you're going to bat
like 125 for your whole career
so no joke i i downloaded uh on game
pass i downloaded nhl 21 instead
i've just been vibing in in ea shl
threes
i i did i put zoom on the strike zone
but like even still
i'm just like i'm a quarter of a second
late on like every swing and i was just
like dude this is like
this is more of a job than my job like
it's more frustrating than than my
actual work
i don't think i'm i don't think i'm cut
out for the show anymore man
did you watch dan play mlb and just
pitch every ball
into the batter dude
pitching is not easy either like
pitching is uh
pitching's hard the meter for pitching
moves so fast
okay we're just moving on no problem
here
it's it i was having a good time i just
like i i couldn't bat man
it's just too it's too i'll just admit
it's too hard for me
to combine that with the fact that like
i started my career accidentally as like
generic player model you know one of one
that's that's a that's a rough one right
there um
and uh his name is joe random like
there's not a lot keeping me in that
game right now
big ups to uh to sony for
putting that out on game pass and saving
me some percentage of the 80
that i would have spent and then like
felt compelled to like
beat my head against the wall trying to
actually figure out what i was trying to
do in that game
instead i feel like i can just move on
pickups sony mlb whoever yeah
however from putting it on game pass
it's completely ruined the servers
yeah i heard like um i mean i heard it
from you that like the missions don't
work
so it's like your experience gain is
like really uh
it's slowed down
i don't know if that's related servers
do be offline
well dude just get the streamer uh white
list
you know it worked for path of exile
dude i was laughing during dropped
frames yesterday i had no idea
what it's not not rude it's just not the
the circle i run in right
but i had no idea that there was like
path of exile drama
um and then i also came to realize
how chad says they don't like drama but
they actually know like every piece of
stream or drama that's ever existed
hold on we're gonna we're gonna use
money
why not like they were
uh and by they i mean you
but like as soon as the drama was like
alluded to on dropped frames people were
like streamer names streamer name
streamer name
inside joke inside joke streamer name
stream your name and i was like
how did how did i not hear about this at
all
it's apparently it's like the highest uh
you know yielding drama content of the
month or something like that but uh
the people were just like life's not
fair life's not fair low would you the
life's not fair and i'm like i have no
idea what you're
talking about but i guess uh i missed
out somehow
that's that's darn true man life's a
b and then you die that's why we get
high because you never know when you're
gonna go
we shouldn't stand so close to the
enemies man
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
okay check the check the shop
we can do it
it's good enough that's i mean we're
gonna die on the next floor
probably like 80 odds but why not
please do a z's whole verse like you
used to uh do i haven't listened to
illmatic in a long time
is that realizing the realism a life in
actuality frick who's the baddest the
person's status depends on
salary but my mentality is money
orientated
i'm destined to live the dream for all
my peeps who never made it
we were beginners in the hood us
five percenters then something
must have got in us turned all of us
into sinners
something like that
jesse what are you jess mr white i'm
talking about illmatic
one of the most important hip-hop
albums ever invented made whatever
dude only an absolute would try to
do death's list on this room
and yet nevertheless
i never had a choice
look at that easy
yo mr white you never listen to good kid
mad city
it's simple mr white it goes halle berry
or hallelujah
zero luck but we can work on that
like i always say mr white everybody
gonna respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives
forever
dude that's right we're gonna get that
trinket that gives plus 10 luck
a little spooky do we need to hit the
shop up for a holy card this one could
actually work
it is a great album no no question
holy card
favorite track is probably money trees
but i mean like you know
uh b word don't kill my vibe that's
another good one
holy pill
well it's been a fun run um and i mean
you know swimming pools is it's a good
uh i mean it's better than a good song
it's a great song
but uh i i'm a money trees guy something
uh you know the vibe
sure just kill me i guess okay with uh
we take this still but it's a good
choice
dude we're shooting we're shooting blue
fires
on a regular basis here it's a positive
thing
that being said we literally still
cannot be hit
at all i'll do it man is if if we get
hit we're just we're just done
if we get a holy card
we can start to get excited like right
now this is like being a fan of the
vancouver canucks
you know we just beat the leafs two
times best team in our division despite
the fact that uh
we were down with kovid for three weeks
and
traded away adam gaudette for for a sack
of hockey pucks
um we don't get to get too excited
we get a modest degree of hope right now
no thank you sir
no thank you
we don't get to get excited yet until we
sweep the season series with ottawa
starting tonight
and if that happens then we can start to
talk excitement
[Laughter]
sweeping clear sweeping clear
as a leafs fan i now hate nils holgander
that's good you know not as much as you
hate jim houston right
it's another luck upgrade that bad news
is a little cursed you're not wrong
raise the clubs is pretty good man
eternal d6 that never mind it's the d1
yo
but no now we're thinking because if we
can d1
a holy card
that's amazing
it's not happening yet but we can start
to think about it
bed gives holy mantle effect
please mods remember this username if
this turns out to be false
this is a perma-ban situation do you
swear i'm gonna have you swear on a copy
of the brady game strategy guide
do you swear that you know for a fact
that this gives us the holy mantle
effect
i do not appear to have the holy mantle
effect okay don't don't actually ban
them
that was just a funny bit but the other
thing i was gonna say is people are
always like blow this rug up this is
clip farming i'll let you know in
advance this is clip farming sorry we're
trying to make boss rush
in all of my years of playing isaac i
have
never seen a dirty isaac room rug
become a crawl space or a black market
everybody says there's
uh a chance okay well you know we'll cut
cut the music
we still checked though
clip farming sucks
this bit is over
clip farming
not yet not yet this bit is over okay
hold on
no save it save it man save it
get out of here 11 minutes catacombs 2.
we're okay yeah we're on pace we're on
pace
why am i fishing for death's list
like am i really gonna let i don't even
like pick up stuff on the ground that
would help my run
but every time i walk into a room i'm
like we gotta do that's list here
it's just it's so stupid the juice is
not worth the squeeze man
yeah i'm dying for like you know getting
soul hard drops now that's some serious
damage
like this that could be a holy card dude
okay it's not but there was a chance
see that's why you take death's list 10
tears upgrade okay we out of here
no sweat
ghost pepper luck is it's a great combo
you're not wrong
could be a holy card in there man
get him
also like very non-conducive with trying
to get boss rush
is uh trying to do death list
as well oh my atlanta
little spicy
you know sometimes there's there's a
right time for that
okay i've decided 11 luck ghost pepper
is the strongest item in the game
no it's a mimic don't
don't do that don't give me hope
i'm scared that i'm scared of the mimic
dude i just
want to go to the shop if we go to the
shop we get a holy card
and we can win the run you play
to win the game
what are the voros twins up to now
they're still pogging up man
they're still they're still chilling out
on social media
they're making fun of themselves a bit i
can't believe i didn't get hit there
like they did one like a prank where
they go to um
mcdonald's and they go i'll take the
drinky
the bergie the friesy and then like the
joke was that like
you know they got upset and then through
the they threw all the food at them
pluto size down i'm very tiny now
pluto's fun
i my size is pluticross right now
plutocrystally small
i i i'm not upset by the item because
i'm sure the item is good but like
do you see ghost peppers save my life
there on a run where you like can't get
hit or you'll die like
this is a very dangerous thing to not be
able to see yourself very well
please holy card
that's a lot of money though that's a
lot of money dude
most of the shots will fly over your
head now
it's good to know that's good to know
you can fit through the spike door
without taking damage
look that's the kind of thing we'll test
on on a future run
we do a little trolling here
can we oh you can open the mimic
i hear you sin that's why i replied to
your tweet i said
you know isaac content creators myself
included were down bad with the release
of repentance
people in chat and this is not an
anti-chat bit you know we've had a good
day today
there will be people who will like show
up and not know that you've played a lot
of isaac they've played like four hours
and they're like hey just so you know
like
you know if you bomb blue fires like
sometimes there's spirit arts in them
and you're just like through gritted
teeth you're like
i know i know
no
oh yeah you used to be able to before
they nerfed it
so i want it but i also don't want to
risk
taking damage so it's a bit spicy
but yeah we got a cobalt we got to keep
this or not cobalts in victor we got to
keep this to our
our private discord otherwise i i get
into it too easily i i get
i get i i tilt myself i'm not gonna deny
it but
it's too easy for me to just start going
off go ahead take a shot
bro not like this
please get me out of here i gotta go i'm
not doing boss rush on this run are you
crazy get me out of here
get in range i was scared because he's i
don't want to get in range because he's
uh
the turret was scaring me because it's
got that new shot speed that hasn't
entered the public consciousness yet
okay okay
that hurt i didn't shoot because i was
trying to get death's list to pop
that's that's painful that's painful
okay we got we got one more in us here
that's not too bad
two item rooms dude why not you know
why not
it's a good item like we've been blessed
with some good
opportunities on tainted lost it's been
my bad that the throws have taken place
i don't know like that
the glowing hourglass one is still a
pretty thin margin for victory
but
it's true tainted lost only gets good
items so
that explains why the deals of the devil
are like better than usual
still get some goofy ones on occasion
but
the game also does a little bit of
trolling
dude i mean like you can
try to troll me about uh soy milk but
like
soy milk no knockback is actually legit
soy milk with knockback from afterbirth
plus was like
absolutely horrible
pretty bad
i don't mind you you're like one of the
easiest bosses and this is clip farming
so i apologize to that
uh germa one guy um
one of the easiest bosses to not get hit
by
now just blow yourself up
come on man like you're so yes you're so
easy to kill
blow yourself up so that i don't have to
use black hole on you
there he is there he is
okay little speed upgrade we don't mind
you crazy
can somebody please call neil degrasse
tyson we've encountered something that
has broken the laws of physics
um the widow has such strong power
when it jumps it's capable of getting
out of a black hole
riddle me this a black hole
is aptly named as its gravitational pull
is so strong that not even light
can escape once it passes the event
horizon
yet a little spider apparently
not only strong enough but also fast
enough
to get out of the to get out of the way
of a black hole
how am i supposed to defeat an enemy on
the first floor that's
faster than the speed of light edmund
does this make sense to you
see this is why i like christopher nolan
movies because he actually does the work
to make sure that he gets the science
right
but not everybody uh cares as much about
their craft
as someone like christopher nolan does
he's kind of a perfectionist
except for well it did part in
um the dark knight rises where batman
uh escapes from the turkish prison and
then makes it to gotham city in like
under 45 seconds but yet
even though the bomb was ticking um
he had the time to for some reason put
a a lighter fluid bat signal
on the on the bridge that didn't
but you know that's not how that works
you don't get it he had to put the
the bat signal on the bridge
because he had to send a message to the
people of gotham
that batman was back in order to stop
the revolution from happening to give
them some hope that batman was back
okay it wasn't a pothole
i mean a pathol it wasn't a plot hole it
was
because listen
there's a method to his madness
you seem to know a lot about pots 420
baby love favor holiday of the year 420
baby april 20th earth day
i'm still not sure if the dark knight
rises is good
i think it's a little bit like the red
hot chili peppers
um i don't think it's good but it's
kind of fun i think it's a big letdown
after the the dark knight but
it's uh like like it really doesn't make
any sense
there's a lot of stuff in the movie that
if it if you try to
uh subjective to any kind of analysis
it falls apart but tom hardy chewing
scenery
as as bane it was kind of is
entertaining
it's not a bad idea what about a double
effect holy card oh baby
of course he did need subtitles i mean
i'm
you're not gonna catch any uh any
dissent here i actually think that all
movies in the theater should have
subtitles on by default
i just i watch everything with subtitles
on
closed captioning i would prefer not
because they always put it over like
people's faces and stuff like
that accidentally but like you know
subtitles at the bottom of the screen
absolutely
subtitles disarm comedy
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
[Laughter]
you'd have no respect for the
the surprise of comedy that serves as
the foundation of laughter
sorry i was unnecessarily in
insubordinate and churlish but
i just i prefer things with subtitles on
because you know what here's this
happens to me in the movie theater all
the time
i don't know i'm i think i'm about to
expose every
husband on planet earth okay you ready
for this
sometimes we'll be in the movie theater
watching a movie
and my wife will lean over to me
and say like what did that guy say
even if i know what he said i usually
just go
i don't know i didn't hear it anyway i
didn't hear it either
just because i don't want to talk in the
movie theater it makes me uncomfortable
so if they just um put subtitles
on okay i guess we're doing this now if
they just put
subtitles on i wouldn't have to deal
with that awkward situation anymore
i'm so glad that like i was a little
apprehensive about the bit but so many
people in chat right now are like i do
that exact same thing
kate get in here
okay is is something
it's something
my ex would sing along quietly to the
songs in the movie
i think it depends what movie you're
seeing i'm not initially gonna jump to
the
conclusion that like she's crossing the
line
i think there is some like when i went
to see the lion king remake
adults and children alike were singing
along the songs in the movie
and i was like what do you expect you
know you're gonna see a remake of uh
like one of the most popular musicals of
all time like it's gotta happen
if you go see like a kids movie and
everybody already knows the songs of
course they're going to be singing
but if you know
if you're going to see like les
miserables or something like that
and you're you're singing along with the
songs and i've never heard of the play
before i'd probably be like
if you could knock that i wouldn't tell
you to knock it off i would just
make it a recurring bit on the stream
and you know
bring it up for like eight years running
but
my dream to dream of days gone by
what do you think about people cheering
in marvel movies
literally i've only seen it happen
two times in and i've seen almost every
marvel movie in theaters
within the first couple of days of
opening one
is in infinity war
when thor showed up with stormbringer
everyone was like that's that's cool
and then the other one was on when cap
america picks up
mjolnir that's where people were like
losing their mind
but that's kind of like i don't know
like there's some movies where you want
some decorum in the movie theater for
sure
and then there's some movies like like
endgame is kind of a weird one right
like it's a celebration of this like 10
years of uh the 10-year event that's
been building up
like i'm like keep it down hey
i know i'm here at the midnight showing
of endgame but
can we act like adults please
and dude there's some weird experiences
at the theater though like when i saw
midsummer in theaters
people were just like flabbergasted
there's i mean if you don't know what
happens in the movie it just gets like
mega
weird but also scary it's just it's like
the most uneasy
comedy at the end close to the end of
that movie
there's people like looking around in
the theater being like are we actually
watching this like
what the heck was in that lemonade man
it was a disorienting theater experience
also especially because it was like
three and a half hours long and the
whole movie is
it takes place during the daytime it's
very disorienting
i had a great time
that's all i got hereditary similar
thing
i feel like i i don't know i would get
annoyed at hereditary probably
in the theater i'm sure somebody was
like
what was that some kind of movie where
you can just imagine somebody
at the end shouting out like um
okay
and i'd be like shut up
but that happened um
when i saw um and astra
i forget oh wait what did the guy say at
the end it was like
there was a little 17 year old kid next
to me or something like that
at the end of at astra he was just like
bad movie
i didn't enjoy it in particular either
but you know
just kind of like he's like the dead
game guy on
on fall guys twitter you're not wrong
i was like yo he's out of line he is
right though
dunk dunk
that donkey
donkey donkey
no you know i kind of like the luck idea
here
plane lands bumpy bad landing
dude i had a weird moment yesterday it's
not that weird like it's not it's not
mid-summer weird
i was sitting down with the baby i had
like you know half an hour until baby
shift was over
um on tv the uh
tom clancy film jack ryan
shadow recruit i said you know what i
heard this was bad
um but i've never seen it maybe we can
get some anecdota
anecdote farming out of this watched
about
half of the or the first half hour i
should say
and then he lands in moscow
and the guy who played like zak sos or
whatever you know
from the season two of game of thrones
is his driver
and he was like you know welcome to
russia and i was like wait a minute
this seems mighty familiar um
i watched like another 20 minutes and
i'm like i'm pretty sure that what
happens here is like
you know he like hits his head on the
back of the toilet or something like
that and goes like ah
and then it happened on the screen and i
was like what the
i actually i it turns out the
memories came flooding back to me i
actually watched that entire damn movie
it was just a long time ago on a
on an airplane it was
literally like the the most forgettable
movie
to the extent that i had forgotten that
i had seen the whole damn thing
it's crazy it was like i lost a little a
little piece of myself somewhere on the
line
um i think we should probably try to
take four and a half volt if we get a
chance
we reached him wake up wake up
dude if i'm in a coma right now go away
just let me sleep i'm having a pretty
good time
i don't want to get up i'm i'm like tom
cruise in vanilla sky
baby
put me under
wait that's not how the vanilla sky ends
but like if it did
on a scale from 1 to 10 what's the most
five out of ten movie that's ever
existed
hmm that's a good question it's the most
five out of ten movie that's ever
existed
i guess i mean the first thing is
defining what makes
one five out of ten more of a five
yeah i guess like just being
unremarkable
but also inoffensive because i think
there's like there's five
like i i would describe hugh jackman's
the fountain
is a five out of ten but that's a five
out of ten this one for the fences
i kind of feel the same about joker you
know it
it didn't work for me but i i can see
how it did for a lot of people
and and they you know they the volume
was high on that movie
you know it's not like uh they just made
the most boring movie of all time
they went for something you know
that that didn't
that didn't work for me but uh i could
see how it could work for some people
um most 5 out of 10 movie of all time
that's really tough man because like the
first thing that pops into my mind
is um the last kiss
with zach braff and rachel bilson
but like it's such a 5 out of 10
that people don't even remember the
movie
ever existing by the way we're about to
lose
but i think it's not even like a five at
that point
i think it's like a one
i told you it was going to end slash
mark



hush dark path let's do it man born to
dodge
yeah i won't tolerate no bruce
springsteen slander
look he since the 1980s he hasn't done
that much i've been super interested in
however 1975's landmark album uh born to
run
top to bottom slappers born to run 10th
avenue freak out
hiding on the burke streets hiding on
the bed
jungle lanes come on man
i forgot about this part
stop saying lightning in the thunder
you've gotten stuck in my head i know
that's what you were trying to do and it
worked
yeah jungle land is legit man if the
whole steady release jungle land
like you wouldn't be able it would be
like the new all my friends like people
wouldn't shut up about it for like a
decade but because it's bruce
springsteen people are like you know
yeah whatever grandpa
anthony thoughts mr fantano you know
what i could send a tweet to him right
now
he won't respond but that's fine
thunder road look i've never been a huge
thunder road guy but it is a great song
and also one of the all-time like side
one track ones right
what is the thing on the top left here
so this is um
when you are uh
tainted isaac you can only hold eight
items small rock is definitely worthy of
being one
i know we could get close to spun but
10th avenue freeze out such a banger
dude that's the thing like
it's got one of those things i i like
when bands release like one song about
being a band
it's got some fun stuff going on like in
and and now there's something in the
dump
and the big man joined the band and then
the guy on the saxophone like he's like
that's my cue and he goes like screaming
it's good man
he played megalovania exactly
there's some good songs about being in
the band that's singing the song that
you're currently playing
rock and roll band by boston it's not
boston's best song but you know
it's it's not skippable
this dude's off the maps off the map
band on the run we don't speak about
band on the run
boston most overrated band of all time
this is like an asinine take
more than a feeling is one of the best
songs that's also
so overplayed i may never want to hear
it again i'll give you that one
you know what i i feel like
for our you know what
give me this i trust this more
um what was that okay more than a
feeling great song
very overplayed but for play long time
like
apollo is right that's that's one of the
best rock songs in history
uh okay you know what we're trying to do
boss rush so we're not gonna go curse
and we're just gonna leave
yeah yeah yeah
all right we can't look i know there's
youtube fans in the chat
i trust me i've been down this road many
times in my life i try to go to bed for
you too
south park did more damage to the
reputation for you two then then you and
i can rehabilitate unfortunately
it's i i i wish people gave you two the
respect that i feel they deserved
but it's it's too late south park
destroyed them somehow because
bono had the audacity to like try to
help cure
hiv and people were like wow you must
think you're like some kind of big shot
they're like yeah i know he's done a lot
of great humanitarian work but like he
takes himself a little too seriously
plus they put their album on my
iphone without me giving them my
permission so
you two is the same thing right like
almost everything they've made since the
mid-1990s is not particularly good in my
opinion
but they did enough in the 80s
to make up for it it's like the rem
thing right okay i gotta like this is
complicated i think i'm just going to
take ackledama gonna sell my house in
town
like the joshua tree great album pride
in the name of love
great song like even um
mysterious ways you know that whole like
i forget what the album is called from
the
mid 90s it's called zoo or something no
way it's called octun
baby hello hello daniel's chat
i'm not even going to ask you how you
feel about uh
not coldplay because the dmca memories
are probably still fresh in dan's mind
i'm not going to ask you how you feel
about you two because i think i already
know the answer
we can just move on instead
these are not worth working for in my
opinion
most bands though because they're like
hey you know they got worse as they got
older
like all all bands got worse as they got
older
if they if they lasted okay radiohead is
like the exception that proves the rule
but any band that has been popular for
more than 20 years
they did not get better when they got
closer to the end
the strokes come on man everybody's
still they're leaving their lighters on
for is this it
you know they're not they're not leaving
their lighters on for
you know whatever that the song that was
on mlb the show last year was
swans i said fans who were popular
okay i'm not trying to say they're not
good nick cave okay i'll give you i'll
give you a nick cave
i'll give you another exception there
this is not i we can pick it up for the
card at least but
okay i can't follow this i'm sorry to
tell you this is just too much i'm gonna
have to tap out of the run
i think we want rod and baby and then
lusty blood
and then somehow to find a way to
survive
oh there's meat that's that's how we'll
survive okay
now we're talking
donkey tonka donkey
actually the beatles yeah but the
beatles weren't around for 20 years the
beatles were only around for like 10
years
hold on i want this as well i feel like
like spirit arts are gonna be important
here
also the beatles didn't get better and
better you know their final album let it
be was considered by
far their weakest album of their of
their prime although i will admit that
ebby road was recorded after let it be
so
there's a there's a slight difference
there but still
all right we can't take too much time
we're a minute and a half slower than
we'd like to be
um but i think we got a great setup here
for for
the future lusty blood is gonna help out
a lot if we do choose to do boss rush
yeah don't come on modest mouse you're
gonna make me cry
i've been using my youtube music
subscription and listen to a lot of like
90s
modest mouse and i forgot i was like hey
man this band like
i used to like him a lot
i don't know what is we just unlocked
this so it's got to be checked
break your enemies i don't mind losing
adrenaline probably like stem cells
would be next
out you get
bones when you kill enemies how about
that
good news for people who love bad news
is better than the moon in antarctica
i mean that's just like that's just one
of those takes that's
designed in a hermetically sealed bad
take laboratory to make as many people
angry as possible
like i get it you got a fondness for
float on because it's like the first
modest mouse song you ever heard
it's the first modest mouse song i ever
heard too but i mean like word
we gotta tackle this like from a good
faith
uh context right like
that's all i got i i my opinion on the
red hot chili
peppers has softened a little bit
i still i i love them as a kid
you know in sixth grade we had to make a
restaurant
uh like a fake restaurant menu in french
class i named my restaurants
the red hot chili peppers
because i was so into um
the album californication
these bones just don't do anything huh
um
oh francais i can't remember
but then like i don't know around the
release of uh stadium arcadium i
realized i'm i'm like pretty sure this
band just
keeps remaking like the same two songs
over and over
in one of them they go
and then in the other one uh we should
take the hp because we get to keep it
yeah and then in the other one they play
it a little bit more melo
um if we i don't care if we've gone to
the item room with only eight items i
want to keep the boss rush pace on
um
but i've come to i think terms with the
fact that
you mostly just listen to the red hot
chili peppers if you're trying to have
some fun
you know it's not a band that for the
most
not to say they don't have a thinker or
two but it's uh it's not the kind of
band you turn on and you're like you
know
where is it
it's a band you turn on and you go like
wow listen to this guy rip the bass
it's bad damage we can't afford that
that bad damage man
sloane is still good dude sloane
underwhelmed might be like the
the least well-known canadian 90s
classic
they're a spring break band like slint
uh excuse me
excuse me are you saying that
they're the kind of band you could work
through their entire discography
over spring break because uh heavily
debate that
yeah slint only has like six songs uh
but they're
all well like two of them are all time
classics the rest are
you know reasonably enjoyable if you're
in the right mood but
it's the first time i've ever heard
slint and the red hot chili peppers
compared
for spring break energy oh okay i'll
give you that one
red hot chili peppers are like when
you're going out having a fun time with
your friends on spring break
and then slint is like when your friends
didn't invite you to go get ice cream
with them and you're like a little bit
sad about it
i i hear you on that one
don ordered salted caramel ice cream
okay just just chill baby easy
easy mode okay so forget book of
revelations man
here's what you do okay you open this
son of a gun
you grab the bible easy mode
sicko mode you turn it on
doesn't matter what you grab because
we're not keeping it
doesn't matter what you grab because
we're not keeping it
doesn't matter what you grab because
we're not keeping it matters a great
deal that you get satanic bible
still on pace
we don't need to like i don't know if
dan's here we don't need to talk about
weezer
it's like his favorite band of all time
i apologize
to him that i constantly have to remind
everybody that they haven't recorded
anything good since the year 2001.
have i made because this just popped
into my head
just so happens to be the best song in
the world it was the best song in the
world i mean you gotta try not leaf just
to hold it
but um we can get rid of it later if we
want but
have i done the bit yet where like the
weezer cycle is the same as the sonic
the hedgehog cycle
where like it just goes around they're
like new weezer came out it sucks
whoa the new single from the next weezer
album came out they're back baby
it's the blue they're they're doing the
blue album again
hold on yeah we're still on pacer boss
or boss rush don't trick me
then the whole album comes out and
they're like actually it kind of sucks
and then like it just goes around in the
cycle
well no the zelda cycle is similar but
then people fall in love with the zelda
that's
one zelda ago or two zeldas ago i guess
um this is the sonic cycle because the
product remains maligned for the rest of
its life
but
also for more university stories like um
i had a roommate who just dude these are
these are some good items this is a
tough choice
i think we take the soul that's how much
i value that um
i had a roommate in uh in university
well like a housemate i guess but he
listened to
like two songs over and over with no
headphones one of them was
uh afterlife by avenged sevenfold and
then that summer it came out
on uh rock band two or three
and he just played it for like hours and
hours
and then the other one was i am the
greatest man that ever lived by weezer
which also i believe coincidentally came
out on
uh rock band that very same summer
and he would always like make me play
guitar on it well he's saying it and i
was
yes i'm the baddest or the bad i'm the
best that you've ever
i do better
and i'm like oh this is just like it's
like a very
dr horrible sing-along blog sort of
energy it's back in the day where
everybody wouldn't shut up about like
buffy the vampire slayer
that's surfaced some memories of mine
that i'm i'm working through some trauma
right now i think
he's a nice guy though don't get me
wrong
we're still friends to this day i think
he would find this bit humorous
is that it's the same guy do i feel bad
now because i'm like we
he's a really good guy we do dunk on him
a lot though
it's the same guy that mouth has a
couple of stories about
that like he used the communal internet
connection
to download like a bunch of uh
stuff on spring break that one time and
then try to blame the other housemates
uh echo dom is pretty good i think maybe
we'll get rid of
more options for now because we're about
to move on um
this is tough we don't have a ton of
time i think i'm just gonna i'm just
gonna head down
i think we got a workable run and then
also is the same guy who used to
um instead of making
like food every day he just had a big
like
stainless steel bowl full of ground beef
in the uh
in the fridge and he would take like two
handfuls of it every day and and make
burgers out of it even though the meat
was like two weeks old
based it's like i suppose it's a little
based
in some ways
now you know as somebody who didn't have
the uh
the financial uh interest there like i
didn't live in that house
it was nice to go to their house because
you know whatever you wanted to watch he
always had it in like
you know 4k he'd be like hey do you want
to watch like this 1990s cartoon in 4k
and i'm like
why not man
absolutely
how could i refuse
how long ago was this i don't know like
2009
not that long ago it's just 11 years
ah 12 yeah my bad
[Laughter]
i was saying earlier today in in an
isaac episode i recorded today
i was like i always like to
recontextualize my age because i think
it hits harder
the one thing i said recently was um you
know iggy azalea's fancy is now
as old as aqua's barbie girl was when i
went to my senior prom which is kind of
crazy
because when i was in 12th grade i was
like dude that's like
barbie girl that sounds like ancient man
but like now fancy is as ancient as that
song was okay this is
this is a no hold on
this is a no
this is a maybe like ghost pepper can be
pretty good with some luck
i'm gonna do it like i don't i don't
think ankle dom is all that man
go ahead and give me ghost pepper for
now
dry baby's not that good it's it's not
worthy of being one of our only eight
items at least
um alexander hamilton by the way
uh is nod leaf that's still up in the
air but this is kind of like nod leaf is
like our get out of jail free card for
now
so the new bit of contextualization that
i had for my age
is this isn't gonna make you feel that
old probably but it makes me feel pretty
old
uh like my favorite class that i taught
in
south korea
they were born in the year 2000
which means they are now this year
gonna be as old as i was or maybe next
year they're gonna be as old as i was
when i taught them english which is
crazy
because i would i i was 22 and 23.
so i guess it will be next year but
still like that's crazy
yeah that's why all these stories about
teaching english in south korea you know
you got to keep in mind contextually i
was still just a little kid myself
hello hello
this true that that did happen
hello oh there she goes she's
she's pogging she's pogging
she's going crazy she's hip she's with
it
it's kate hello
it is our seventh year anniversary also
known as the happy anniversary we lasted
longer than
kim and
us being kanye for nine years that's
pretty crazy
that's a long time
that's all i got
[Laughter]
i was trying to make conversation and
i'm like ah we got
all the conversations during covid that
kate and i have now are basically like
our baby's really cute and then the
other person's like
yeah and we just like with just bandy
that back and forth for like an hour
man our baby did this really cute thing
today wow
that's cute and we just trade baby cute
stories
like earlier today she made a sound that
was like
grrrrr i was like that's really cute
i think you will enjoy the game that i
played emily is awake
hmm
oh it's a long time ago now
yeah 13 years
on that i'm gonna play rain on your
parade uh today kate you know that game
it's like hitman but you play as a rain
cloud
so you gotta like ruin people's days by
by raining on them
or like maybe you would like in some
situations you don't just like rain on
them but you know you could like rain on
uh like a generator that causes them to
lose electricity and then their day is
ruined and stuff like that i'm excited
to i'm excited to give it a try
it's therapy it's self-care in my
opinion
yo baby's eating some potatoes today
let's go
this basically that's a paternity test
because if this baby doesn't like
potatoes
there's going to be questions that need
answering
like i'm not even worried that it's not
my baby i'm worried it's not a human
baby
if you don't like potatoes like do you
have the human genome
i don't like potatoes okay but do you
not enjoy the flavor
slash texture of potatoes or
do you like the attention you get when
you tell people that you don't like
potatoes you know what i mean
careful there you go
let me take that thanks for the hp i'm
gonna leave
not leaf i'm gonna leave it i don't
think we need it
i don't think it's the play
i would rather have slow shots i think
um and then we gotta try to make hush
it's gonna be a little close we're gonna
give it a shot though
what's your favorite kind of potato
that's a tough question
you can do some like ranked choice
in this for sure like for example the
worst kind of potato is definitely just
like
just boiled like boiled potatoes served
on the plate with maybe like a little
salt and butter
not so much okay raw is worse yes
okay or like with poison sprayed on top
of it
but uh
yeah we're good we took the negative
okay um
after that it gets a little touchier who
doesn't love
like the rest of the varieties
i would say next is like just baked not
baked potato i should say but like
you know just cooked in an oven for like
you know chopped and then cooked in an
oven for 25 minutes
i would rather have them mashed i would
rather have them
fried or smashed i would rather have
them baked in some aluminum foil maybe
and then you pierce them with the fork
on the top and and line it like a jacket
potato or something
those pills dude
it's tough though like it's it's a very
it's a tough question
i couldn't even answer like what the
best kind of like french fry is
that's i'm still dealing with it in my
head i really like it curly
but if you take the the zest from a
curly
and then you put it onto a wedge i think
that's the best but even then you end up
with some like
some wedges that are overcooked some
wedges that are undercooked and you know
it's it's it's it's touchy man it's
touchy
it's a difficult question
the important thing is they bring us
together
i finally had some uh tornado potato you
guys had any of those
i thought i thought it was gonna be a
meme i had one
um a couple of years ago when i was in
my hometown
it's basically like it's it's a potato
that's like
it's all sliced up like on a on a
spinner and then put on a stick
it looks like hannibal lecter dissected
a potato and then served it to you to
eat
is i guess the way i would describe it
um i don't even think we should try this
i think we should just
try this we got hp
and then we get rid of it um
yeah there you go like a 360 degree
hasselback potato
i i had one in my hometown at a
restaurant and i was like this is not
that good
and then i had one at a food truck in
vancouver
and i was like actually this is
fantastic
this is i mean it was also like seven
dollars and fifty cents
which is pretty expensive for you know
when you consider that you're buying a
potato
which is like 40 cents but
don't hit me um it at least it was cut
in a wacky
shape that helps to dampen the uh
the the sticker shock
the zane up to the price tag
and then like i i you know there's not
like another six bucks built in a value
because they let you choose the
seasoning and i was like bill pickle
now i was like that was that was worth
it man that was worth it
i don't know why i feel like i should
have walked over the spikes there
do you still only buy single potatoes at
the grocery store
it's like another take that i always
feel like i'm realizing now that much
like american politics there's like a
real
urban versus rural divide in chat a lot
of the things that
chad thinks is normal that i think is
insane
is due to the differences in the way
things work between cities and like
towns
and a lot of the things that i think are
normal that chad thinks is insane
is due to the the difference between the
way things work in the city and the way
things work in the country as well
like i could you know if i'm reading the
newspaper or something like that and i'm
like look honey there's a house on sale
it's only 1.6 million dollars
you know my wife is gonna say really
what's wrong with it that's gonna be our
first reaction
and if you if you lived in the country
you would be like how many acres of
arable farmland does that come with
i want neither um
i think we'll beat hush but then the
same thing like
with the grocery store like
you know when the grocery stores are
like close when it's not much of a
a trip i like to go to the grocery store
more often
and i buy you know the foods that i need
for that
individual day or two and then you know
when i run out of stuff i'll go back
again
this this is the thinking man's gamble
okay i think i agree with you
i think we need technology that's that's
fine maybe
um
no thank you
i think we need tech one and
i think
if we take tech one we can afford to
you know what we get the opportunity to
swap a little bit
the soul is a really good defensive item
i want to try this just for a second
so we lose a decent amount of damage
i here's what i'm gonna do okay i think
i'm going to take a cult and leave ghost
pepper for now
no i'm going to take a cult i'm going to
leave spider bite for now
and then if we want to we could leave
the soul
after this we could leave the soul from
this point onward
because the soul is mostly going to be
useful for this fight
what the heck is oh we got like a little
marked synergy here how about that
so i think i'm just gonna well let's
crack this
hold on this adds another little wrinkle
into things
i suppose we could take uh i suppose we
could take
metronome into the fight if we got the
but the backpack is gonna take up a spot
yeah yeah no thank you
check the synergy with eyeballs it's not
a bad idea because i'm never gonna take
the backpack
all right i gotta be honest that seems
kind of incredible um
let's get rid of let's get rid of
nothing i think this is fine for now
we'll just leave this right over the
center here
all right this is a beautiful synergy
it's still doing damage it looks it
looks a little weird but it's still
doing damage
and look because we have the soul we can
get up we can challenge
we can challenge
i am worried that this is going to crash
the game but
i appreciate the banter engine toasty
thank you
thoughts on long sleeves plus shorts
that's for me
i don't know what chet hayes would say
that's my outfit of this season right
now
like it heavy on top and and comfy on
the bottom that's that's been my vibe on
the baby walks
i'm also i'm thinking that maybe it's
the right time in my life i'm embracing
comfort uh more than ever before i'm
wearing wearing sandals more often
although i'll be honest if i'm going for
a long walk i find shoes more
comfortable but around
like if i'm just outside of the house
for a little bit the sandals are nice
taking the garbage out for example um
but i think i might even graduate to uh
to having one sleeveless hoodie
in my wardrobe i don't know if i have
that kind of like european vibe
but uh i'm willing to give it a try i
think i'm willing to cut the sleeves off
of a
hoodie and see how sleeveless hoodie
plus shorts works
i'm gonna have to shave my triceps
though
it's gonna be a whole thing i have one
and my girlfriend hates me for it
oh okay well
but it's it's about the dad energy it's
not about
what your girlfriend feels about it it's
your dad energy
that's an f boy outfit i thought it was
like i thought it was like a dad
yeah bill belichick drip i thought it
was bill belichick's outfit
i moved to milan and i don't fit in at
all everybody's so fashionable and i
don't understand fashion
i hear you honestly like i mean milan
obviously is it's got to be on like
another level
there's a lot of very you know
well-dressed people in vancouver
though uh a lot of people you know
there's some slacker energy but even
with the slacker energy from the pnw
they also are like you know there's
people that are really
bringing their a game to the fashion
department at all times and i'm just
walking around with like streamer merch
do you even need to shoot anymore oh
trust me if i could stop shooting i
would have done it by now um
this just sort of it it just happens on
its own
i don't have any control over the uh
over the fire rate anymore
oh you could press control and stop ah
we've come too far
all right i mean dude we gotta stick
with this
soul of isaac has appeared in the
basement so we could do delirium
but in order to get the unlocks we have
to go to the dark path so i think we
should just go to the dark path man and
honestly like i feel like
why why i mess with this right like this
is it's a good thing
donkey
i mean like it's it's melting them why
fight
bosses mate when the freaking eyes will
do it for you mate
you did delirium
is that what the outside is
i did do delirium oh dude
let's go let's go
sir do you want me to run the treasury
or the state department
let's go sorry i can't get it
live in moments that live rent-free
like seven of them are lin-manuel
miranda
call me son one more time
that's more like mickey mouse but
hey hey
him biting his lip
clearly middle-aged lin-manuel miranda
i'm only 19 but my mind is older
that would be a great video moments that
moments that live rent-free in my head
moments that really butter my biscuit
gordon ramsay loses his mind at chef's
explanation of fresh frozen
is there anything here that isn't deep
fried
the salad the salad
are you taking the piss
chicken banana sorry sorry sorry
yoink dude
here's a game for you what's one of the
things that you saw on kitchen
nightmares that gordon ramsay was
flabbergasted by
that actually looked pretty delicious
all start
he goes off on that grilled caesar salad
where they put the lettuce
on the grill and give it some like char
marks i honestly thought that
i've seen that clip like 10 times i
think it looks pretty good
i got nothing against that salad i'm
glad to see
a lot of people in chat without
colluding we're like the salad didn't
look that bad
i think he was okay it was dirty because
he didn't chop the bottom of the lettuce
off but still
apart from that i was like dude if i
didn't
that it was dirty which i wouldn't if i
ordered it for sure
i would i would probably eat it
in fact i would probably enjoy it yeah
he showed it to the whole restaurant
it's
it's bullying man no one's gonna be like
actually gordon it's pretty tasty
everyone's like
gordon made fun of it everybody laugh
huh we want gordon to love us
hey i like gordon ramsay don't get me
wrong i'm just saying i thought the
salad was like
it wasn't that bad i was not i was not
aghast at the quality of the salad
um
there's probably more i do see some
people saying the greasy pizza from that
one episode
i kind of disagree with that you're
welcome to don't get me wrong
but that pizza in denver that was like
the the largest greasiest pizza in
history
i did look at that and go like that
looks a little gross to me
but if it's the sort of thing that
you're i mean
just yesterday i was saying like i got
no problem with pizza hut and that's
kind of like pizza hut's
raison d'etres so i can't really uh i
can't really front i guess
not the deep dish one oh okay different
one then
i mean i don't think i've ever once well
this is the kind of thing you got to be
careful about saying
on stream where people can like verify
every word you've ever said in your
entire life
but i don't know if i've ever once been
like
like look at how much grease is on this
food i think instead of saying that
i go like whoa geez this is really tasty
i think i wonder what their secret
recipe is
olive oil how about that
okay now i'm here to tell you the run's
okay
we're takings we're taking some dumb
damage
no questions there i think it might be
time
to take a deal with the devil
and then like just the best deal with
the devil that we could find
just to swap this synergy out of here
i think we wouldn't mind swapping the
eyeballs out of here
just to become a little bit more sane
because here's the thing the longer a
room goes on the stronger this gets
right like this is if the room goes on
for more than five seconds we can't be
stopped
however the start of the room
is really tough you know we don't have
the ability to quickly kill enemies
so i'm entertaining the thought
but now i'm like you know what it's
actually looking pretty good
if you can just not get hit for three or
four seconds like you get the damage
potential to just like
end the enemies
the spiders are touchy though
don't mess with the wind well that's
what i'm saying like i think we have a
run that
should crap on the boss pretty easily
but the rooms that are in advance of the
boss are of a modest degree of spice
maybe not a ton once you make it through
the first five seconds you're pretty
much clear but like
those first five seconds are a little
much
interesting character though i like uh
i mean i think this is one of the
characters so far where i prefer
um you know regular version to
uh tainted version
but it's still it's a neat idea for sure
what hap what happened to my shots what
happened to my shots hanged man
there's a picture of new york a picture
of new york i'm just free styling
sometimes when i freestyle i lose
confidence
he's spinning uh oh he's spinning you
see
it's the only time in history a hanged
man card has been used to avoid
stepping on creep damage
what am i i almost uh do okay we gotta
look right like
i gotta see what this looks like
it looks horrible
like it actually seems like horrendous
but let's do it for one room just to see
what how it strikes
us
yeah it's i mean that the damage is
actually really strong
when the ship well no it's not actually
yeah this is terrible
if you can get multiple shots falling at
the same time
it's still pretty bad
but not as bad but still pretty bad
all right that's you know what a lesson
was learned there
the heck's going on in that room
tell me your ludovico without telling me
you're ludovico
yes sir shouldn't have taken that
literally stop to think about it and
then made the wrong decision anyway
um we might swap out no i can't
i mean our damage is pretty good but i
don't think
i'd rather have like one more spirit
heart shooter would make the the rooms a
lot easier
before the boss but it's a tough it's a
tough call
i mean this run should be a pretty easy
win right now
tech isn't doing anything here um excuse
me
spare two seconds i disagree with you
okay we could go get another room um
but i'm not gonna i'm actually just
gonna grab this
so here's what we're gonna do okay we're
gonna start the fight you know how it
starts
get as much damage out there is as early
as possible
and then as our damage builds very
slightly with lusty blood and there's
two hitboxes instead of one
that's where we bust out shoot the whoop
okay lusty blood was not impacted at all
but still
it's looking pretty good very solid run
very solid runs today actually
look at that posted notes achieved
he's done it mom's lock has appeared in
the basement
uh slash marker repent great
tainted isaac



all right we're playing uh
repentance don't worry about the streak
that streak isn't
for for me to know and for you to find
out
that being said it might be a good time
for us to take a look and
uh you know maybe just try to do
something that we can
actually accomplish with the character
here
forgotten alt path or forgotten true
ending
why not why not let's let's try to get
some momentum
let's try to get some momentum qn6n cne4
looks like my streak hey you know
wouldn't surprise me
yet uh you do have to keep in mind i'm
i'm trying to beat like the hardest
characters in the game i did a bunch of
tainted keeper runs this morning
not necessarily insanely difficult but
when you're trying to force the
the hush and the uh excuse me when
you're trying to force like the hush
and uh and boss rushes on every single
run it can
uh it can get a little touchy you can
get a little tricky
dude so far so good they wouldn't give
me a bad pill early
most people don't know this but there's
like a a pill anti-pity timer
the longer you play the more likely you
are to get a bad pill because the more
likely you are to be strong
when you first get started they don't uh
they don't give you bad pills because
they don't you know it's like you only
get one chance to make a first
impression
now you might say that it's not science
to which i say science
uh is the study of not knowing what you
know
there we go now we're talking what
science don't know won't hurt it
let's put it that way
just chill i do it i didn't even realize
that the bone actually gives you uh
or the the the bone plus parasite i
should say actually gives you like uh a
tear effect
it might be new almost lost that bone
heart
how do i get health down in the first
few rooms then try not getting hit
okay you know what we chill we just
chill
just enjoying ourself i i refuse to
fight you this is like
captain america the winter soldier i'm
with you till the end of the line
look at this plum
consider yourself spared you're getting
out of here you're flying
you're done you're done this is the only
attack that is any danger at all
just fly out of here go on
leave thank you you know what we got to
do next is like
smack as she tries to leave
that's the that's the next step is give
them
as soon as they decide this isn't worth
it anymore that's when you go to town
that's when you do your real damage it's
just rude
be that as it may okay you know
this is a little spicy
we don't want to lose that bone heart
i'm willing to lose
wait i'm a fool why don't we just do
that
okay and then we want to do all panther
true ending
either okay let's do alt path i mean
this runs not incredible so far but it's
uh
we're early on here i did forget that
the soul existed
i mean you you got to cut me some slack
on this like
it's actually like the most complicated
multi-task
in probably in in life's history and
this is the voice i use when i'm being
facetious but i'm
uh i'm not being facetious like you're
playing as characters you've never
played before while not the forgotten
but
every character is a little different
and you know this isn't isaac
uh you know 1999 where a little
different is like this one's got
slightly more hp
you know this is uh isaac 2021 where uh
you know it's like and then you you
don't get any item rooms anymore but if
you spend enough money then you get
super shops
but the shops still cost money but you
also have money equals power deals with
the devil cost money deals with the
angel cost uh luck
you know like it's crazy um and then on
top of that you're like trying to
banter and then on top of that you're
like reading chat scrolling by at like
you know five lines a second like
there's the old brains getting
it's getting saturated at like a record
pace right now
i'm trying to focus on you know just
like walking and dodging and and so on
and so forth
and people are hitting you with comments
like just so you know if you happen to
pick up proptosis on this run
proptosis and pump plum flute used in
conjunction with one another gives you a
two percent increase to you know
your dividend yield and you're like
what's going on with the
proptosis and then they're like oh you
don't have it yet i was just trying to
confuse you
like in case it showed up in the future
and you're like what the heck's going on
man
this is i'm just i'm just trying to keep
reality straight here
don't hit me again okay we got to get
this bone heart going
okay
pop this down run for your life
great great damage thank you plum flute
and goodbye plum flute you did your best
that's all i could ask stay moving
stay still stay moving okay good stuff
good stuff
little spicy but dude another bone heart
on top of that that's solid stuff
don't pick this up yet this is very
simple
it's a tough call the nail is really
good though
and uh sac alter does nothing for us
hold on though check this out
[Laughter]
he's a genius whoa okay he's a genius
now this does nothing for us but what if
we somehow got a charge here
and then we'd be talking right we can't
do it but like
wouldn't that be something we're gonna
we're gonna keep rolling the nail that
was just to demonstrate that i
you know i got the knowledge to get me
into college
and we did i guess we did lose half a
demon heart to do it but at least we got
uh
at least we got sack alter out of the
rotation okay there goes the bone heart
so that
you know easy come easy go um
don't do this do it do as i say not as i
do on that one
at least we had fun on the way exactly
it's the it's the friends we made along
the way
you could check the shop for a buddy in
a box and then possibly sack it
look i mean you you could
you know sell your car because possibly
you could like quantum tunnel to work as
well
we got to deal with like realistic
percentages here okay
not like walking in to a shop hoping to
get a half price
buddy in a box in an item pool that has
like 80 items in it or something like
that like this
it's a little much you know
it's anyway this is by the way this is
i'm then i'm just
setting the tone early this is why we're
playing less repentance today
my my patience for the extremely hyper
specific backseating is essentially at
like zero percent right now
i really and it you know it's partly my
responsibility as well don't give me or
maybe like exclusively my responsibility
but like why why is the vibe the the
streamer chat vibe like so
off right now this is it's meant to be
entertainment it's not meant to be
instructional you know we could just we
could all just hang out and have a good
time together
don't don't need to be like the binding
of isaac 101
college class like every single day we
could just ask some questions you know
how do you feel about baja fresh or
something like that and i'll be like
i've never
eaten at baja fresh because they don't
have it here and then you know
we'll live our lives
i figured it's better to my boneheart to
set that tone early rather than like let
it fester forever
okay i'll take a speed upgrade
how do you feel about baja blast i've
also never had baja blast but that's
because i've never
been to taco bell
they have it here but it's uh
anytime i had the opportunity to go to a
kfc taco bell
i always went to the kfc if it ain't
broke don't fix it
okay this is this is going pretty poorly
so far
this is going very poorly so far
get out of here
come on just pop up well give me give me
a taste of your elbow i don't mind
oh that do i didn't i thought it was
just slow creep okay take me back take
me back
yo ice baby is insanely good
i think that's we don't want to get that
boss as the forgotten
because i like don't possess the
self-control the play is the spirit
i possess the self-control merely
to smack things with my bone that's a
bad start
how do you feel about cheesecake i'm
gonna pivot off of that to answer
another question
um or not another question just to be
braggadocious with no meaning
many years ago and by many i mean like
two on the nlss
i uh
i was asked what's your favorite dessert
there was a period of time on the nlss
where essentially like my only
reason to exist was to be made fun of by
my friends who were two years younger
than me for like
having some old man opinions um
and this was one where i felt like i
took a
very very undeserved amount of heat
personally
um they said what's your favorite
dessert and i said you know i don't eat
that many desserts
and this is not a like an old man thing
it's just like that's how i
i was as a child even i would always try
to get like fruit instead of like i
don't know
chocolate cake or something like that
and i i i stand
you know undefeated to this day as a
result however
i said i don't get that many desserts
but i like um
i like a cheese plate and if people were
like a cheese plate
that's ridiculous i would never
in my cheese for dessert what is going
on here this doesn't make any sense
and then wouldn't i was mocked for days
by the way on on social media
on on the subreddit people thought it
was it was being a joke
people thought i was deliberately
misrepresenting myself
not the case uh slightly wouldn't you
know it was
about a week and a half ago bear taffy
tweeted hey
i'm really starting to get into cheese
lately
i i seem to recall bear taffy being the
one who spearheaded
uh most of the mocking in this case to
be honest with you
i believe uh i i can still hear the tone
of his voice
hey hey enl what what kind of desserts
do you like
hey thanks for the genuine question
friend of mine i enjoy
uh cheese plate from time to time uh you
fool you've fallen into my trap by
honestly answering the question well you
should have done
hold on give me this
wait we don't need this yeah but yes we
do that's actually pretty good
i was like we don't need it we got a
good trinket then i remembered it
doubles your trinket effect
dude cheese you'll see cheese is a
dessert
for real not at like you know
taco bell but you'll see it
france is the land of cheese and we eat
it after dinner case closed yeah exactly
just because they don't have it at
panera or you know the
kentucky fried chicken drive-through
doesn't mean it's not a real dessert
okay what is strength strength we need
less than hero font okay take me down to
the next floor
why not use it well you know you put a
lull at the end so i don't think you're
being serious but
if we get no spirit hearts i would
rather
use two spirit hearts to take a deal
with the devil is the loss then pop the
hero font
if you step through that in the debugger
that'll leave you with two spirit hearts
at the end of the day
uh versus popping the hero phone now and
if we get no spear at hearts okay well
now it's
academic but we would have been left
with one spirit heart in the reasonable
case where we got no spirit hearts down
here
now we're down uh a strength card
but in all likelihood we would have died
with the strength card in my uh
in my pocket anyway so no harm no foul
which artificial cheese is the worst
the the goo cheese from like
you know those nabisco like cracker uh
packages that have like saltine crackers
long saltines and then they have like
the goo cheese inside of them as well
those are that's real nasty
that is uh something's not right with
that
i think it's just bad cheese whiz but
like that that stuff is essentially just
you know what i'd rather do it this way
that stuff is essentially
just uh it's just orange salt which is
you know it's not poison but it's just
kind of disgusting
there we go do we we got a real chance
on this one i'm glad we lost the other
one
so we it that walked so that this one
could run
favorite cheese i don't know like i'm
i'm still pretty basic when it comes to
cheeses
i still do at the end of the day like if
you gave me the choice between a few
cheeses
i'm like uh any
any orange cheese is is pretty high on
the list like
i like a a cheddar maybe like a
two-year-old chatter but i also you know
i enjoy like uh
last time i i got some cheese i got some
red laster you know i decided to
mix it up ever so slightly and i was
like hey i've never had this before this
is pretty good
um there's a canadian cheese called oka
that's pretty sweet as well
i still got a long way to go i rely on
restaurants being open to expand my
cheese horizons so
it's been uh you know it's been a bad
time for that
which is a pretty minor uh
pretty minor thing in the whole scheme
of things but
yeah everybody knows about kazu marzu
okay
it's always on twitter like you know
white people will really say like
vegetables are gross but then
they go out and they eat maggot cheese
and i'm like bro i haven't
look i i think beans are delicious to
begin with but then secondarily i've
never seen the maggot cheese
it's not like it's it's not like they
got it around at all
at all possible locations you know
i've never seen kazu marzu i do
understand like it's it's a disgusting
idea
look and i bet it probably tastes
not good to begin with but um
i did you know that uh
with kazu marzu
you have to you like when you bite into
the cheese the maggots
actually like jump out and hit you in
the face
this is not a joke for the record
it's real they like they pop or
something like that like i don't know
what causes it
but they they pop or something like that
and hit you in the face
i want that to be true i did dude i see
like this is the most
like highly represented cheese you'll
never see in real life
i i read about it on twitter all the
time because people are like did you
know people actually eat this and i'm
like like
like six people like six people eat that
let's be realistic
but
i regret it
yeah you can all if you don't want to uh
to deal with the
the the popping you can instead
that's so good man um you can instead
uh smother the maggots in a plastic bag
before you eat it
i did see someone say like it's one of
those things that like uh
when most people try it they tend to
like it
and i'm like i just feel like it's one
of those things where if you are
you know whether you believe you can or
you can't you're right you know that
expression it's like that but for cheese
if you're the kind of person who's like
i really want to try the maggot cheese
you're probably the kind of i shouldn't
have gone for it you're probably the
kind of person who's gonna be like
mmm so good
delicious
because to like admit that it tastes bad
would be like
you're not as as open-minded as other
people right like you're not as worldly
same as the like the poop coffee
whatever it's called i can't remember
everyone people know what it's called
poop poopy collect something like that
what's it called you know what i'm
talking about someone in chat's gonna
know it
kopi luwak that's that's the one i was
thinking apparently there's a second one
but
yeah they like i can't remember if it's
if it's monkeys or cats but they like
feed the beans
to the animal and then collect the beans
after it passes through their digestive
system and then make the coffee that way
lemurs okay like dude cats and monkeys
combined equals lemurs so
what can i say
they're civics who are monkey s cats
dude i don't know that i
big ups to my brain on that one for like
kind of almost being right
um but uh
yeah it's the sort of thing where i'm
like
even if it's good i'm just like there's
a lot of good things
i guess like if you it depends on why
you're trying it i guess
you know that that's where i draw the
line are you trying it because you're
like i bet it tastes good or are you
trying it to get like some kind of
street cred from like check it out i'll
eat anything that's disgusting
because that changes the way i view it
to some extent
okay this is good don't forget you got
to go into the mirror realm
yeah i think i i think it's a flex
that's just my take on it not
everybody's gonna agree but
i i see it as a flex you know what hold
on we probably didn't need to do this
right we could have just
hit the control key
maybe
take me down take me in
anyway it's just not
not a food that's like high on my my
bucket list
but honestly like all the i've eaten
some weird stuff you know i eat uh
i ate some insects in in south korea i
mean it depends whether or not you see
that as weird
people will be like that's not that
weird and then when they see like uh
you know mushroom on their plate they're
like touch the meat
get it away but you know
insects and uh
chicken feed and you know korean blood
sausage and stuff i have i've eaten
whale i've eaten horse chicken hearts
you know blah blah blah um
most of the stuff that would be on like
my culinary bucket list is actually like
like a cheesy gordita crunch
i feel like like it just if i if i die
before i get to taste the delectable
nature of uh cheesy gordita crunch then
it it will be uh
it'll be a wasted opportunity okay i
for i was just gonna say i forgot
that these flies still exist
very annoying to me i can't seem to
generate the range necessary to hit you
i knew it was common man i knew it was
coming
those it's those dang flies man
everything else is totally fine
the flies could not be hit i should have
just become the
the loss to go through the
i window also just learn not to go
through the door
like that's or not to go through the
boss fight when you go through the
mirror i mean to say
i've never eaten sir stroming i mean if
i was gonna
if i was gonna record it for a video i
might consider it but like
just for uh just for curiosity's sake at
this point in my life i think i'll i'll
probably avoid it
i got nothing left to prove i think
for i am for me anyway
no i never had a carl either the um
the fermented shark
i don't think so anyway i've been you
know
some of those icelandic memories are a
little fuzzy
i imagine it's bad
because it's known yeah kate was talking
about how i don't like acorn jelly is
absolutely right
like i i've been getting a little bit of
a reputation as a picky eater when it
comes to korean food
the the thing i'm gonna say like in my
own defense
is that uh
it's not that i
am a picky eater when it comes to korean
food is that a lot of the korean food
that comes from this like meal prep
service
has like the same four ingredients that
i'm not a huge fan of
so it it it's like you didn't like this
dish or this this or this dish and i'm
like yeah because they put
you know kongnamul in each one which is
just like uh
you know it's bean sprouts but like
i'm just not that into them i'll eat it
but i'm like not that uh
i'm not that big of a fan i guess
if you'll excuse me
like they'll give you like a you know
yuk gaejang or something like that and
i'm like yuk kejang is
is delicious i love it and then they're
like actually it's kongnamul yuke jong
we just like to fill out the soup we put
12 000 bean sprouts in it and i'm like
you took a good thing and you just i
don't know why but you just tilted it
slightly into a situation like i'm not a
i'm not a huge fan of
don't even get me started on the uh on
the boude game man i'm
it's just it's a little much for me it's
a little much
i mean i think i would eat uh
look i refuse to take all these
deliberate mispronounced
mispronunciations from chat in uh
in stride after the faux fu debate we
got into over luck be a landlord
you can just you can put it through your
google translator okay
when i when i anglicize the name people
are like
in today's climate that's insane of you
and then when i say the real name
they're like
pete bootage edge what are you talking
about
kappa face
but i'll i would eat any food
i think that i have never eaten before
if the main reason people eat the food
is because it's delicious
rather than the main reason people
eating it being because of the fact
that it's weird
not all foods are consumed because
they're delicious
some of them are are consumed in my
opinion at least
for for street cred like sir stromming
i don't think anybody is uh is eaten at
for pleasure unless they're like a an 86
year old
sailor from uppsala like right
that's that's my my take on it at least
swedish people do
i don't think so because like not on
mass
is and i'm pretty ignorant when it comes
to this but like
any time i've seen a video where like
someone goes to sweden
there's always like some six foot eight
swedish guy who's like yeah we all eat
this over here
and then they open up the can and
literally everybody
that's around is gagging like within a
30 meter radius of where the can was
opened
that's i never thought about that
cucumber tastes like watermelon rind
people love it watermelon rind tastes
like cucumber
people hate it i would
close it's close to to being apt
because watermelon rind is it's firmer
which could be a plus or a minus i guess
depending on who you ask
but then secondarily it's it's kind of
like a little
tartness to it you know it's got like a
little sourness
that is that is absent the uh
in the cucumber
don't shoot me
i liked the fat bastard impression you
did in today's isaac oh thank you
okay dr evil let's make a deal
wait i lost the accent i don't know
become littlefinger again
you get your mojo you keep your money
i get your baby
i we can't i mean i suppose we could but
we don't have to do the bit
yet again but um it always
they really gloss over the fact in
austin powers that fat bastard is an
aspiring cannibal
like he they're like he austin powers
does say you
really are a fat bastard just in case
you didn't get the joke to begin with
like that's his name
um but it's like nobody ever goes like
dr evil's response to fat bastard
wanting to eat mini-me
is right
it's a little bit understated is all i'm
saying
and then i did i never got an answer
over whether scottish people are
offended
that uh mike myers took a scottish
actor's role by putting on the scottish
accent
during uh shrek
like i feel like he took he took a role
that could have gone to like billy
connelly or something like that right
people in the comments said nobody was
offended that's not for them to tell me
i'm here to tell them they should be
offended
billy connolly and ewan mcgregor should
have played shrek
billy billy connolly would have been a
great shrek you and mcgregor i'm not
sure if he's much of a voice actor
because he just sounds like he's from
coruscant
let's mix it up i don't mind that
yeah here's a question for you has
mike myers been in a good movie and the
answer is yes now that i think about it
but it's
you got to think for a second has mike
myers been in a good movie
where he didn't put on an accent
he puts on an accent in all the austin
powers
all the shreks and also
inglorious bastards
the answer is wayne's world one i think
but
he was indeed in in inglorious bastards
he played the guy who introduces
another guy i think it might have been
brad pitt to uh winston churchill
i'm looking for the mirror the mirror
fire just give me a moment here
he does for real yeah no joke
oh he introduces michael fassbender i
thought you just said michael fassbender
for no reason
and i was like why is everyone talking
about michael fassbender
and then you know i was gonna say
michael
fart bender i thought that could have
been funny but
whatever happened to michael fassbender
it's just
michael fassbender is like the the best
actor who
takes the worst roles
he don't get me wrong he's been in some
great stuff as well but the fact that
this guy
is also in like the the bad x-men movies
and then all of the ridley scott aliens
i have you seen um alien covenant
there's some like truly bizarre stuff
that happens in that uh
in that movie like michael fassbender
does a scene
against himself where he says
you hold it i'll do the fingering like
it they knew what they were doing there
yo you can still swap here
it's just yeah michael i i like michael
fassbender as an actor he's been in some
good stuff man
he's all like like why the hell is he in
like prince of persia man
was it because his wife was in tomb
raider or not prince of persia sorry
assassin's creed totally different
properties uh by the way i guess
alicia vikander she was gonna be in tomb
raider and he's like
i can't let my wife get one over on me
i'm also gonna play the lead in a movie
based on a
uh third-person action franchise that
probably won't be that good to begin
with
yeah that's his wife man
boss challenge room is open
i'll allow it i'll allow this one
what's the oh you're gonna you're gonna
get me onto some negativity when you ask
this because you
you say what's the best movie it was
well worth it
based on a game and i don't have an
answer for you
but what i do have is that i was kinda i
wouldn't say
hyped but i was like people have been
pretty positive in the buzz for the
mortal kombat
hbo max movie then they released a scene
today where like jax crushes some dude's
head
and i was like i gotta be honest i think
it
looks like it's made by mouth
is violent don't get me wrong and that
that doesn't offend me i was more just
like
i i kind of expected it to look like uh
i don't know like it was made by like a
legitimate film studio but
it kind of looks like it was made by
like a like a ryerson student
no offense if you go to canada's number
one school for media studies but like
okay we're good to go it was taking a
while here but that's okay
at least it was violent i guess which is
kind of like what you want out of uh
out of it but at the same time i was
like
i don't know it just didn't look uh no
it just didn't look right
something about it just looked like like
it was i mean i guess obviously it was
like shot on a green screen or something
like that
because they didn't actually go to you
know like
nether realm and then fight on a rickety
old bridge on top of a spike pit but
i don't know man i'm skeptical
yeah it looks so uncanny valley is one
way to describe it
anyway so again sorry for the ryerson
slander you gotta pick a school and like
you know i make fun of my own
alma mater enough
there's only like 20 universities in
canada and you know
pretty much everybody knows all of them
except for lakehead
don't
embarrassing embarrassing
i'm telling you i so we're doing the
this is halloween thing right now
but i'm also telling telling you that
like um the
boss rush song is alexander hamilton
that you can't tell me it's not inspired
by it
what are the stereotypes sure
of every um canadian university you can
name
uh well i can't really speak on that
okay
there's a few you can you can get to for
sure
um like i didn't know this because i
grew up in kingston
i didn't know what the stereotype was
for queens at the time it was a
well-regarded school
then when i got there everyone was like
oh yeah queens is like this the school
you go to when you're
from toronto and you're rich and you
want to
get away from your parents for your
undergrad you could go to u of t
but you could go to a school that at the
time was almost
as good and you could also like party it
up a little bit
i didn't realize until i got there i was
like i you know
i thought it was a school that was in uh
it was just enjoyed for its academic
rigor but that's apparently that was not
the case
um i'm trying to think of like the
the other stereotypes that i know like i
know that
uh waterloo and laurier have like a
rivalry
it's like if you go to waterloo for like
math or computer science or optometry
because those are the only programs that
they have
you spend 60 of your time in class and
then you spend the other 40 percent of
the time
telling everybody you know that they
call uh
wilfred laurier university the high
school across the road
a little snobby and but you know what
they've been taking down a peg because
everybody was like oh my god
uh did you know research in motion is
here did you know they make blackberries
here and then the company like
you know fell from grace in a huge way
so
things have you know i did they got
their own problems to deal with let's
put it that way
um i don't know the stereotypes for
for the british colombian universities
like i got nothing to say about ubc
except for the fact that
it's like the most gorgeous campus i've
ever seen in my life and the fact that
it costs the same to go to
as other canadian schools is like is not
fair
to the other canadian schools it's like
this the same way like you know in a
in a a sports league you're like you got
the opportunity to play for like the
same amount of money in either like new
york city or
you know dayton ohio like how are you
supposed to compete with
with dayton that's where guided by
voices is from
yeah ubc is is sick man i mean honestly
i bet sfu is cool too
it has less of an academic pedigree but
i already i said this a couple streams
ago but like um
sfu is the school where if you went to
the school that i went to for
programming
but it wasn't like hard enough for you
it didn't get your juices going then you
transferred to sfu so i'm really like
two rungs down the ladder
i don't remember this vengeful spirit
but i don't really remember like what
you do
i'll take you anyway but head strong to
take you
on head strong i'll take on
anyone
you got mentioned once in a university
of victoria course
i'm sick dude i'll take it you know
i'm not allowed to go to the island
right now because um we're on like
stage 17 quarantine
people this is not a joke ontario
lockdown
interprovincial travel and then british
columbia was like
oh you can't even like we're going a
step further than that
you can't even like move about the
province anymore
but people from alberta can come to the
interior of bc but people from vancouver
can't
go to the interior but you know it's
good public health it's just i i just
think it's funny is all i'm trying to
say
it's not like i'm going anywhere anyway
but um hold on i'm just trying to
just thinking we don't really care for
maggie's faith we need the nail man we
need the nail on this one
i did i i saw that you were here daniel
uh i i laughed when i saw that post that
was like
you can say it was from a news reporter
that said like you can see if this
uh you can tell me if this crosses the
line but i really just want to give doug
ford a hug right now and i was like
come on come on you can't
you can't type that anyway though um
yeah we're going down here we're good
geez louise
yeah not not that damn multiple daniels
it turns out you do not under any
circumstances have to hand it to him
uh spirit heart what did i tell ya
as true doug ford does look like
he could give a great hug he's always
like standing in the hug position
you know with like his arms awkwardly
kind of like in the
in the knuckles pose
like do you know the way
hug forward
you have to go after blackberry because
they were always you
weren't there man you go visit mouth at
university of waterloo
it's like summer 2008 they needed to be
taken down a peg
they were on top of the world
oh you go to queens oh i live in
waterloo did you know that's where they
make blackberries
they just wouldn't they wouldn't
freaking shut up about it man
did you know j i saw jim ball silly at
uh the peta pit
last week quit bragging dude
they got above their station man they
they started to think of themselves as
as better than guelph
and that's where i draw the line
half of waterloo cs works at either
facebook or shopify oh dude i'm just a
great program
as from what i hear anyway hello
hello
yes g-u-e it's it's spelled like it's
pronounced
g-u-e-l-p-h guelph
it doesn't i mean i've said this before
i don't think it really matters what
school you go to like for your undergrad
at all
unless you know there's specific
programs maybe where it actually matters
but
you know if you're just getting like one
of the one of the classic like
you know i got a degree in x then i
think in canada it doesn't matter too
much
like people said like lol guelph i have
a friend who uh
if you'll excuse me here he got his
bachelor's in environmental engineering
at guelph
then he came to ubc to do his masters
and now he's like the some
some role that i can't possibly
understand
like he's the vice president in charge
of something
at a wastewater treatment company so
like you can
you can definitely do well for yourself
regardless of
where you're going for undergrad at
least
if you're getting your masters from the
university of arizona
i don't know people might they might
start to take issue with that but
no seven seven seals is bad
as we've touched on many times we don't
we don't touch that item
forgot that it takes the whole heart
my bad right
i'm not trying to insult the university
of arizona okay the largest twitch
streamer went there
i'm just trying to get my licks in
also isn't it uh
online like american universities
all i know about them is like
harvard yale brown oxford
not oxford's british sorry um you know
all the all the ivy league universities
i know that they exist and then i know
that
um
the university of arizona has a
reputation
no it's not university of arizona you're
right it's arizona state
arizona state has a reputation for
uh for partying yeah
that's the one i know
what the heck is the university of
arizona what was i talking about
and then um i don't know kate's
kate's sister is always she went to usc
i know it's she's she's a big deal she
knows it okay
um and she said that there is like a
a huge usc versus ucla
rivalry um
to the extent that if you have
like your car parked and you have a usc
bumper sticker but it's like a ucla
neighborhood
you your car might get vandalized
or maybe you'll be killed that's the
this is how the information was relayed
to me and i
i looked upon the information
incredulously i said that can't possibly
be the case
i'd simply don't believe it but i i
default to the wisdom of of chat on this
one
is true 100
man not quite true but you might get
keyed
aren't this is being honest like aren't
the people that go to those schools
and i'm jealous aren't they like huge
nerds
aren't you just like big dorks
i thought you had to be like a i was
gonna say
like a no-life genius to go to one of
those schools but i mean that in a
positive way
ah there's because there's the sports
teams are good there's also some
jocks oh this dang jocks ruining it for
everybody man
all state universities are like that
that's crazy like
hey hey and there's like canadian
university rivalries
like queens and western i guess have
like a rivalry
i just like i don't know man
i think there goes my bone heart i think
the way
i won't say for everybody but the way
that i thought about
um university like
changed a lot the more that i was in it
like in my
first year of university when you go to
homecoming and you see like all the
alumni come out and they got like 1978
jackets and stuff like that you're like
wow that's so cool and they're like
getting their 50 year old guys like
getting hammered
and being like i you this building
didn't exist when i went here you're
like that's
sick dude that's crazy i can't wait till
that's me
by the time i was in fourth year and
you'd see like
old alumni coming back to get hammered
with 19 year olds i was like
this is like the lamest thing i could
ever imagine i was so happy to just be
gone i mean it's not to say that the
university experience was bad but i was
like look i did my time
i had i had a good time and now it's
time to let go and like move on
otherwise it just gets kind of sad
so you know you just say i don't want to
be like van wilder
i actually much preferred the vibe like
i mean
different places in their lives right i
preferred the vibe like when i went to
like night class for programming
there was no social life at all and i
was like this owns
people were like you know hey you want
to hang out after class and like get a
beer they're like i have four kids
i'm gonna go home and get three hours of
sleep go to my job
and then come back you know next
wednesday to to this class like
now not maybe the the best school to go
to when you're
20 but you know when i was like 27 or
something when i started that was
it was a good time
that being said we did still steal the
uh enemy team's
uh mascot and then put it inside of a
meat locker it was the prank of the
century
no we did we did my the school i went to
as an adult has no uh it has no sports
teams
or or clubs of any sort maybe i don't
know
yeah dude i feel for people that are
going to like
you know they're of the age to be
undergraduates in during covet like this
it's just a bummer like you know it is
what it is and
you know there's worse things going on
but i could definitely understand the
complaints
it might seem petty like people will
probably tell you like oh
it's not that you don't get to party but
yeah at least like you're not
dead it's true don't get me wrong but
like
i got to party and my classes were like
in person
instead of online and i'm also not dead
so you know i can see why people would
be
annoyed i guess
quit bragging i'm not bragging i'm being
sympathetic
i've done no damage to you huh
do you take damage is that like is that
a thing you do
i'm gonna take a hit here i'm gonna take
two hits here but that's all right
because i got the hero font
do they have frat parties in canada um
the school that i went to like queens
doesn't have a greek
society or anything like that i'm gonna
take it i'm not afraid
but there's definitely still i mean the
same kind of scene
but i don't know like not not hazing
i think not to the same extent at least
i'm good to go yeah yeah yeah i'm good
yeah yeah yeah i'm good to go
what's greek society well okay like
i don't really know but you know how
when you watch a movie about an american
college
they live in like these weird houses
where like
the upper classmen are just chilling and
then like the underclassmen are like hey
i hate all that crap you asked me to eat
and uh now poop it out and eat it again
it's like that's
that's greek society if you ever watch a
movie about american
universities
pretty much correct oh thank you
[Laughter]
do you was just apologizing i've told
every story before
but um in my third or fourth year i had
and we don't have like a
frat culture but you know we still have
the same kind of like social life i
guess at
my the school where i did my undergrad
in my third or fourth year i had a
partner in or
like a group member in my business class
who was
in second year and they lived in a house
off campus
and they were like hey uh you were
throwing like a beach party tonight
like everybody from this group's invited
so we went and we came out to it
help help me um just uh
you know he wasn't a particular fan of
his but i was like you know
this this will be weird a beach party in
like december in ontario
and when i walked into his uh house
they had covered all of the this
this sucks right here they had covered
their floors with a tarp
and then filled their entire house for
two floors with sand on the floor
like not overflowing like the whole
bottom floor was submerged but there was
like sand on the floor
of each of the levels um and everyone
was
walking around in like beach clothes and
stuff like that right and
we were like dude like this
is your landlord okay with this and he's
like i don't know probably like it'll be
okay
and then we left oh geez dude i'm
kind of stupid um we left uh
early to go someplace else and
you know forgot about it then like a
week later we had to do uh
some more stuff for our uh project
that's pretty solid and he was like
yeah sorry guys like i can't make it my
landlord's
real pissed about the beach stuff so
like i've gotta go
meet with him and then i think he
actually had to
like uh go to small claims court with
his landlord or something they at least
had like lawyer
meetings and stuff but like he wasn't
the sharpest tool in the shed
he did he skipped like our major end of
the year presentation as well to do a
karate tournament like
just just to paint a little bit of a
picture of what was going on in this
guy's head
[Laughter]
it's kind look it's not not based
okay it's a little based
and it's not like it was an important
class but you know he
his his head wasn't in it wait dude that
was so i took in
in my second year
i took like intro to business or
something as an elective
and i had i don't know hold on i'm
getting all twisted up maybe it was
it doesn't matter what year it is anyway
not in my
first year i took intro to business
and we had a four-person group for our
final project two of the girls were
friends
and we we it was me an engineer
or an engineering student and then um
these two girls and we were like hey
what are you uh
what do you major in and they're like oh
we're undeclared which was a huge red
flag because i don't even think you
could be
undeclared like at my at my school it is
just something like they didn't do
and they were totally fine for
the entire semester they they did their
work you know that was assigned in the
group projects and stuff like that
and then when it came time to do the
final report
they just didn't respond to any of the
emails
so we me and the other student did the
entire project
and then we just told the professor like
they didn't do anything on this so don't
give them any marks for it because we
were pissed off
um and then they failed the class and
then they
right as the thing was due they sent us
an email that was like hey guys we
weren't around this
weekend but we did a lot of work
throughout the semester so we hope that
you'll like
you know just understand why we couldn't
help with the final project
and you know i don't i don't even know
if we emailed him back but pretty soon
after that i'm sure they found out that
uh we saw through their elaborate ruse
[Laughter]
it's just i think there's a lesson in
there you know like if they had been
like hey
like we have some it wasn't a huge
project right but if they were like hey
we got something going on
we can't be there even if they were
doing
nothing we might have just been like ah
you know it's just more frictionless to
just like
at least they let us know give them the
credit or something like that but just
to like ghost us
and then be like hey we hope you'll uh
you know see it our way narrator voice
we did not see it their way
[Laughter]
the ghost thing was was i'm not going to
ruin anybody's academic i don't want to
i just want to get my degree and get out
of there
but if you're going to be a jerk about
it then you know
then play stupid games win win stupid
prizes at least go to a karate
tournament or something you know
okay don't lose the bonehearts they're
precious
i'm telling you the the old path is not
looking
superbly likely but
there's there's a shot we do have nine
lives
um just forget that for a second we
might polaroid's pretty good but
i mean we take we should have done
actually maybe it doesn't matter what
order you do this in
not much anyway that's very good
don't listen you did the right thing i
don't know i think most people were
saying we did the right thing honestly
polaroid invincibility is like worse now
right
that being said we really don't need
damage
so i think we're just gonna take the
polaroid
seems prudent
all invincibility is worse
the sun is up the
hearts are blue it's doable
and so are you seems prudent you know
that song
wanted one of the better beatles songs
no doubt
although i still stand by dear dinosaur
being a little bit better
as well bro i hate this guy
i don't i don't know what you do dude
just chill out
surprise of the number of no's in chat
you got to remember that
for chad the beatles are the most
overrated band in history
even though like wolf mother exists no
offense macros
even though greta van fleet exists
well this is there's a certain degree of
spice here
that that could have gone worse there
were some good dodges there
oh sorry sorry i forgot about ac dc that
one is like the other two i picked just
to like
cause controversy ac dc is the real
right answer for most overrated band in
history
they might even be good like oh frick
why am i doing this it's a fantastic
question
just a just a wonderful question
you can like ac dc i don't have a
problem with that
it's just when you're like hey you gotta
listen to this ac dc song
and you're like i already listened to it
it's called thunderstruck highway to
hell hell's bells
dirty deeds dunder cheap thunders okay
they have two songs
thunderstruck is almost like a it's a
real distinct entity
every other song is was created in a lab
to like
get people hyped before a hockey game
starts
apart from that i'm trying to think if i
have any other lab partner stories
i have like an inverted lab partner
story that might put a smile on your
face
uh in 12th grade i had a philosophy
class
which is why i'm so well grounded and
stoic um
and as we learned a lot in that class as
you can tell
um anyway we had to do a report
i don't even remember what the report is
on but when the report got assigned
um and groups were picked two kids were
sick
me and then a kid who we would describe
maybe as a slacker okay he was doing
like uh
he was doing a gap year and was not a
particularly like academically minded
individual
uh he was just kind of like
in which is fine you know he was 18 but
you know he was at he was doing a gap
year or an extra year
just because he didn't know what to do
with his life right which again at 18
makes perfect sense
um so we did the project like we
collaborated on it
the project turned out really well
and we both gave like a really good
presentation at the end
that got a great grade and then and it
was a good teacher okay
i want to say in advance this is one of
the best teachers i
ever had but the teacher came to me
after and like made me stay after class
and was like hey so be honest
did the other kid actually do anything
or did you do it all
and i was like nah for real like he did
50 of it like we split it right down the
middle and we
you know it was a group effort and he
was like are you sure because like
you know i mean he i don't remember him
saying like
you know this other student has a bit of
a reputation
but uh you know i think that was the
subtext and i was like
i was like yeah he did it he did his
work
it was not mouth mouth malfun i did not
take leap years
we were like bruce springsteen songs as
soon as the
as soon as we got our cap and gown
here the day was
i think we're gonna go for this man
bruce springs springsteen most overrated
uh yeah most overrated by people who
don't know anything about music
born to run is is top to bottom like
an absolutely fantastic album
look at these dodges dude
so true bestie oh no i got so true
bested
what i meant to say is 100 gex beats
bruce springsteen any day of the
flipping week
send it good good send good send we're
not free we're not free what's happening
i hate this part
i do not like this part
what do we do here um we gotta hit him
i'm presuming we have to no we don't
have to hit him we just have to live
through the madness
bro stop it
you wanna you wanna play this game two
can play this game
okay okay
saved
play it cool you're doing great look at
that little two-step
i i relished this opportunity to get
some free damage
that was stupid but we got a spirit
heart somehow
why am i so invincible empty vessel
scapular an empty vessel dude
okay we're just chilling i'd like to
chill with you
we're chilling and i hope you'll like
chilling two we're chilling
bob marley just just referencing my meme
we're saved we're not saved that's okay
though it's okay
the man is simply a genius
it's hard to handle this with the
knockback
i got him i can't believe it dude now
that's a run
now that's a run that one of the best
fights i've ever had on
on whatever that boss is called bruce
springsteen
oh baby
now we're talking that's good gaming
slash marker
bruce springs



let's do it there you go you know what
let's unlock um
it's unlike tainted maggie that's
something i can
i can hang my hat on
all we got to do is leave a trinket
behind just remember like the rest of
the game is not
as hard as like that part of the game
get some confidence back and like enjoy
yourself again
i can see why why cobalt got a little
tilted doing some of the stuff in this
game
no not even close
now maggie's pill is like it's not i
think it's always full health now
it did used to always be speed up
use the sack room okay maggie can now be
aggressive with the sacrifice room
am i missing something maybe maybe yes
maybe no
[Laughter]
nice well done
you get a 33 chance of an angel deal is
this a maggie thing or is this like uh
this is an everybody thing
payouts six and seven are the good ones
i mean dude you're not wrong that turned
out very well
it's an everyone thing it's good to know
you know dan
is uh maybe he's onto something about
the eddie room
she just got crazy health and it makes
sense to me
okay just bounce them
yeah i mean like i there's a lot of
trash
angel deals historically in the game but
there's like uh
the angel deals now actually seem very
good also showing
up more often it's a positive for the
game
angel deals were like annoying anytime
you had to go through the game and like
beat mega satan there was a time where
like
you were just playing the percentages
right like you couldn't guarantee
yourself
uh that you would actually get the
chance to get the key pieces in the
first place
it's come a long way i think they did
some good balancing there
i'm an angel room andy now i always
prefer the damage dealers
which i think there's a higher
percentage of in a deal with the devil
but
really after like all those tainted
jacob runs i'll pretty much take what i
can get
literally like anything would be
positive okay tomorrow
you've done your time you've done your
time
let me let me let you back in hello
hello welcome would you care to get in
the box
one day he's gonna learn the lesson
excuse me one day he's gonna learn the
lesson you don't
have to leave the room every time the
door opens
here's the boy here's the boy here you
go no no no here's
it's the box look it's your favorite
dude it's the box
there you go
oh he's already out where's this guy
he's like
he feels like he runs the place now
we're out no trinket we're out yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah we're out come on don't don't go in
the courts
i mean it's like it's come on i'm
begging you
where did we get this spirit heart from
did we did we actually get this on the
floor and i just forgot
you did okay thank you thank you who
needs a short-term memory when you have
chat
it saves you you can use your mental
processing for for banter potential
like i still have as of yet not been
linked to
the subway commercial that says now my
friends call me bones
chat reminder seven seals is good chat
reminder wrong
bad item this is why we need another
verified streamer to be here
so that they can they can confirm or
deny
if you can't store things in short-term
memory you can't transfer them to
long-term memory though
it was much to
your surprises wasn't an opportunity
really to get into
debate about neuroscience of which i'm
sure neither of us
you know we've we've both discussed this
so many times in the past that i don't
want to
dredge up all that stuff uh the primary
literature and so on and so if i was
mostly just trying to have
to make a joke as well all right
i'll discuss that with with the
neurologist we have on retainer and then
we'll
i'll get back to you uh at your leisure
if you could just let me know
do you think subway is the best fast
food
sandwich place i
don't but it's the most prominent and
you know
quantity has a certain quality of its
own
like if i'm eating at a at a fast food
chain restaurant most of the time it's
out of convenience to begin with so
having a location that's that's close by
or close to other things that i'm you
know already require my attention on
that days is pretty advantageous
um but there's also there's a real
dearth of choices here
just like a couple of quiznos um
and and subway still kind of like rules
the landscape
um despite the fact that usually when i
like go to one
i'm like the only person in it
which is probably not a great sign but
it's one of the things that i like about
the restaurant to be honest with you is
that you very rarely have to wait in
line
you pretty much you know as soon as you
go in it's like there's
usually there's like one staff member at
the subways here
and they're hanging out in the back room
and then as soon as you walk in they
like put on the gloves and they're like
what do you have
it's very convenient at least
but i'm like i'll go to bed for subway
you know we we've buried the hatchet
the canadian legal system had its uh
had its way in court i believe the
appeals process is still
uh is still playing out
now i'm i've gone back to subway and
there's just something like
i just like eating a huge sandwich even
though it's not the best quality
something about eating a huge sandwich
is always uh
it's always a pie i was gonna say it's
always a turn on that's quite the
opposite
imagine it's not uh it's not the most
seductive food to eat especially if you
follow up with a side of potato chips
afterwards but
yo ko is going to play isaac tonight i
look
what can i say i i did my best to
anti-sell the game
i did my best to be like oh you don't
want to play this it takes a billion
hours just to understand what's
happening at all and chat's going to
yell at you
and then some people they just you know
they desire that challenge but in all in
all seriousness that's funny i'm
that'll be fun to watch and he's played
like a hundred a hundred and something
hours like this
that's more than a little that's that's
enough to
to have a pretty foundational knowledge
they removed all the cheese options at
our subway in australia
and it sucks it's i mean again
it's there's pretty inelastic demand for
subway i think like
here they don't even ask you what kind
of cheese right they just go do you want
cheese and you could specifically ask
for uh orange or yellow
or orange or white i should say and i'm
like man come on
let's not kid ourselves which one of
them is not
dyed because the rest of them are
they're exactly the same flavor i think
just give me the one that doesn't have
the
the food coloring in it
that's bad damage
but subway doesn't have to be good
for me to eat it
because they're the only chain that's
nearby that will sell you a foot of
sandwiches it's like it's like a drug
dealer
no every other place is like you want to
buy a sandwich it's the same price
and then it's just like you know
it's just like it's a little wii
sandwich i just say
i like the the italian sub style
if we ever get any competition then
they're gonna be in in trouble but for
now that's not a problem for them
apparently
you're never gonna hear me say that like
i'm oh this you gotta try it it's the
most delicious sandwich you'll ever eat
in your life
what you will hear me say is like there
are times when your body might crave
against its uh its own best interests
11.8 inches of bread plus italian cold
cuts and
you know it'll really hit the spot in in
that situation
immaculate conception works on heart
pickups it doesn't work on damage taken
that's actually like incredible intel
first off you're lying
no you're not okay now that we've gone
through that
really that's i had no idea i i honestly
thought it worked the same as uh
escambian it makes sense given given the
themes of the items but
no sacrifice room no eddie room
it is what it is
secret room though dude i
again i'm trying to avoid uh falling
into my own victim
complex here but i do feel like it's
been
a few runs since we had like a
considerable uh damage
up we did get
we did get proptosis
on the boss rush of that uh
tinted jacob run apart from that damage
upgrade
upgrades upgrades have been a little bit
uh
a little bit tough to come by
no more damage ups okay give me an eddie
room man
bomb the same place twice ha so true so
true bestie
don't okay look at that look at that
you're not stealing my charge
boy i sure hope somebody got fired for
that blender
just admit you're backseating and move
on
see i'm hit with the zoomer knowledge
round here we encourage you to hop in
the dang front dang seat
just kidding for a dollar name and actor
chad michael murray how about that
he's done it
yeah ma no longer generates uh demon
hearts
and it also no longer uh gives you a
damage upgrade
i still think it's pretty good
it's nice to have the aoe but
chad michael murray hasn't been anything
since 1999.
um false he was in house of wax starring
paris hilton and jared padalecki in the
year 2004.
who i was thinking of the other day
about that show the oc
oh the oc was like the most popular show
in 10th and 11th grade
in my high school and i was like i don't
know if anybody from that show
has worked in the last 10 years misha
burton
she was like the next it girl adam brody
was like that
that guy who was like he's a little
nerdy he's still like more handsome than
anybody you've ever seen in real life
but he's like a little nerdy so he's
like
you know he's relatable and then there
was the other like the main character
guy
and i'm like i don't even know what
happened to him i don't think i've seen
him in anything outside of the oc
ever the only actor from it that i think
has like a pedigree is
peter gallagher who played the main
guy's dad
oh yeah never mind he's like the main
character in gotham well he's the main
actor my mistake
[Laughter]
i knew he looks familiar um
but is the dad peter gallagher peter
gallagher
was uh the bad guy in mr deeds
and then also played the king of
real estate in um american beauty that's
all i got
that's all i got we finally got a little
damage up too how about that
so do they have to be red heart pickups
or can they just be heels because if
they're just heels
like this is a this is a great option
for us here
wasn't he the bad husband and the good
wife no excuse me that's chris
noth who played mr big
yamaha does not count good to know
i'm still going to still going to get it
here but
i just need the hp to play the sacrifice
room don't question me on any trivia
related to chris noth
i'm very familiar with his entire ubra
including sex in the city
and the good wife
whatever happened to the main dude from
heroes oh do you mean the um
the horn rimmed glasses man mr horn
rimmed glasses i've never seen a single
episode of heroes by the way
i know that it stars hayden panettiere
um i missed like all the tv from that
era i watched
one season of lost and then like
everything else from that era i never
never touched it i think never watched
prison break never saw a single episode
i think of grey's anatomy
um trying to think of what else was even
popular from that era i don't know
never watched 24
never watched fringe i've seen a season
or two of house i'll give you that one
i did watch some house i watched a
season and a half of the walking dead
also known as herschel's farm simulator
2011.
what about everyday italian if i was
home alone maybe
what am i doing man give me an eddie
room give me something here
let's try i watched three seasons of
dexter
maybe even four because i i washed out
after the season
no okay i didn't see the whole season
that that has john lithgow as the bad
guy
like season one was the ice truck killer
season two was lila
season three was was that the the
trinity killer i can't remember
okay give me this membership card
briefly
spoilers
three is the best one to watch that's
the fourth okay so i watch oh the third
one is the one with bail organa right
isn't it with jimmy smith's sorry i
didn't even see this my map was covering
it
bro um but whatever we can get a lot of
plays here
yeah three was the one where like people
do not like it
i thought it was okay but
i i was also i don't know i was like 20.
so it's a long time ago
come on man like we're we're 16 minutes
into the run we're on the caves too
i'm stalling a little bit but i'm just
i'm asking
i'm just asking for for anything
yeah yeah yeah torn photo look at this
graph
will you watch the new season of dexter
i don't think so man like
i just like
i'm a big proponent of like letting
something die
when it sucks if it's still good and
then
like i think better call saul is a great
example right
breaking bad ended pretty strong the
show still had like its pedigree
you're like you know what give me a
chance to check out better call saul
it it comes out and it's amazing you're
like this is fantastic
but then a show that basically like
wears out its welcome
and then is it's coming back i'm like
you had your chance
i don't know why i would uh why i would
start becoming a believer in the dexter
uh
mythos now
but i you know i could be proven wrong
i'm not saying it's gonna suck
necessarily like
if anything i would be surprised if it
wasn't half decent because they have
such a huge like
chip on their shoulder i imagine from
how people feel about the ending
of the of the original run but
don't care dump dunky donkey
gunky donkey but i'm like i don't know
man like just
just let it die
like i know and the the counter argument
is people are gonna be like what about
the marvel stuff well they haven't
really like royally screwed up
yet in my opinion they got most of their
screw-ups out at the beginning when they
were still figuring out like what the
heck was going on
and they're like what about like an ed
norton hulk movie and you're like
not so much and then you're like okay
okay what about like it's thor
but it's uh shakespearean and people
were like
i did they haven't screwed up anything
as bad as uh
as bad as the last season of dexter was
received in a long time
so i think that marvel's they still got
like a little bit of a leash for sure
i would still give him a little bit of a
leash
dunk donkey
i'm not spending anything for that get
me out of here man we gotta get some
momentum i haven't been
this is like crazy i've been off the
like the momentum train for like 20
minutes here trying to farm up this
freaking floor
cave's two 19 minutes we don't have to
do boss rush as this this is regular
maggie
we achieved boss rush probably back in
2000 well what day did rebirth come out
i'm gonna go ahead and say we probably
did boss rush maggie uh about
45 minutes after the release of the game
so that that part of the post note is
already handled i wouldn't mind getting
the trinket at some point though
like like that would really hit the spot
well also i know we got some damage
upgrades but i'm kind of hoping to
kind of hoping to pick up some more 4.08
damage 20 minutes into the run
hp is good when i don't throw it away
but you know i i got a strong suspicion
that immaculate conception is going to
bail us out here
it should be good enough this is a
little little spicy though
guardian angel incoming dude i'll take
like whatever
at this point i'm just gonna be i'm just
gonna be happy to get what i can get
this is like it's
it's definitely like a pseudo train
wreck right now unfortunately
because it's uh
it's a lot of hp but not a lot of
anything else
like really they it's lord forgive me
is gonna make me go back to the old me
though like did
i don't want to talk about item blow
there's so much positive stuff to talk
about but
i'm hoping at some point maybe we could
uh
improve our dps to to a degree that
would even start to approach
like a standard deviation below the norm
but i guess like if you're if this is so
normal i guess maybe this
is the average so uh what do i know
needs a deck building mode oh dude hey
did you did you miss the run at the
start of the stream today boy do i have
a run
for you it's called can tripped
now i've never seen law and order but it
does have like the best
um theme song of any show in history
okay lost some money i like the pony i
don't like using or losing the yum heart
but it is what it is oh my god
i'm losing confidence at like uh at a a
record pace here
i'm begging you for for my for my
ability to to survive and thrive as a
man
please give me something
something that could deal damage some
something to accelerate our
why how is it possible we got 13 items
on the run and it takes me 10 hits to
kill these enemies
kills in two hits forehead
i just think it's okay hold on
the world card hey that's something
the lovers card hey there's something
getting closer to immaculate conception
get the map off the screen okay hold on
hold on self-sacrifice room there's all
there's some potential value there
i'm i'm i'm dying a little okay there we
go i'm actually like i'm dying a lot
i'm only going down to two that's that's
as low as i'm willing to go for the time
being
wheel of fortune pop it down oh my god i
can't believe what what does this turn
me into now i'm
i'm on the depths one i'm playing a slot
machine to try to get some hp back
that's full health so oh dude pog heavy
pog i don't even
where the heck did that come from oh
because we got guardian angel dude
somebody in chat called it look at that
okay blow it up
i don't mind
okay give me some hp please
i still they if they ever make a
repentance too you're absolutely right
that's the next thing they need to add
to the game is the ability
like at a casino to just drop all your
money into the slot machine and say like
go nuts don't stop till you're numb
dude i was thinking everything jar
anything is possible i don't know what
you are but i will hold you for a minute
here i don't know what it does but
i mean i'm not gonna we need the damage
so i'll do whatever has to be done to
get money equals power and then try to
try to build it up here i think um yeah
i don't i don't know
maybe i i bet as you get charges oh no i
can't fly
as you get charges you become stronger
and stronger spacebar items is my guess
but i was thinking about it the other
day like i previously have said you know
i mean like that i don't understand
gambling um but i've been thinking about
it more after watching like
chibs crazy time stream and i'm actually
starting to think that like i wonder if
hear me out here you're gonna have to
give me a second to dig myself through
the weeds
i wonder if gambling is actually like
one of the scariest vices of all of the
vices
because like you know if you're
gluttonous
you eat and then eventually like you're
you're kind of full and then if you eat
more you feel sick and maybe you throw
up
you know if you drink too much you
you hit almost like a self-limiting
point sometimes where you're like i
physically like can't drink anymore
either you pass out or you like
you know you throw up you know like the
body rejects it but with gambling like
there's nothing like that right until
you
uh until you just like literally run out
of money
like there's no physical or
physiological
limitation that's like
you know hey you can't have any more
tonight you can literally as long as you
have like you know your wallet on you
you can always take it a little
like one step further right that's scary
i think i'm starting to understand it's
uh
it's seductive power
golden heart that's not bad
i mean yeah your wallet is a limitation
but i think like
most people would probably you know say
that it sucks more to go
completely broke than it does to like
have a hangover you know what i mean
in terms of like the damage that it can
do to your life obviously like they can
all
destroy your life but that seems like
one of the ones that can
that can really mess it up
i'm starting to understand chip has
illuminated a new world for me
hold on oh you origin thank you
great minds think alike
[Laughter]
we did we got a good team here
i knew it as soon as i saw
it as soon as i was all tabbed i was
like it's a race between me and the mods
okay are we alive what am i doing here
i'm trying to buy money equals power
okay we're gonna buy money equals power
golden bomb is pr not for a third time
golden bomb is very good
hold on no i'm not gonna do it
i thought about it but i'm not gonna do
it um okay we bought money equals power
okay golden bombs
we could bomb the donation machine i'm
just like categorically opposed to it
though
i want to see what happens when you get
this thing fully charged up
do it let's give it a try
yeah i don't wanna i don't wanna mill
the donation machine down to zero here
macros how did you know who i was gonna
bop
um you've watched too much sir
i was like uh you know maybe i'm just
being over sensitive but then now that
you've oh
everyone's like yeah never mind
everybody figured it out okay fair
enough yeah chicken donkey there you go
you know everybody noticed man just
chill out
i said 900 if you live as if you're
broke you'll stay rich we should use it
though
what happened
it became nothing
if sometimes it does nothing
that's cool that's that's that's really
cool that's smart
okay um
it could be an item though
yeah well if some butts were were
candies and nuts we'd all have a merry
christmas but
right i think i mean i'm gonna keep it
because it's funny
like a funny monkey look at the monkey
smile
but uh dude we haven't had to drink it
yet either i'm like i'm losing my mind
all we want is a trinket
and the damage upgrade we did we got
money equals power we had to spend
everything we had to get it but
just uh just to trinket and a damage
upgrade please
like
okay can be in conception please
i mean immaculate conception
stars card
yeah you know i
i don't think this is really going to be
what i'm looking for but i'm going to
try it regardless like this this is the
situation the game has placed me in it
it's placed me into a a situation where
i'm desperate
i'm a desperate man right now
this is a classic isaac episode right
here over an hour long in coming without
a doubt
um very limited damage items i don't
understand getting trolled by the game
half an hour before you get to the mom
fight 10 kills on the board right now
just took out tomato town
this is not every maggie run like we've
been dealing with this discourse in
in the isaac community for a long time
whenever you get like a damage upgrade
people are like
wtf he's so lucky and then when you get
no damage for the entire run people are
like this is what every run of mine
looks like and i'm like i don't think so
man
i don't i don't believe you i think it's
a
second guardian angel baby
i think people notice their own
luck that was not lucky by the way that
was due it's a different story
people notice their own luck a lot less
often than they notice
other people's
excuse me don't don't suck up my charge
this item already does nothing it
doesn't need your help
excuse me don't
my god we're gonna do it okay no
you can't you can't get tilted by epic
fetus come on that's that's that's
uncouth i would love it if you because
you just stop
jumping for two seconds okay okay we're
good we're good can a corn
can of corn clip farming mods he's clip
farming sideways
we're looking for tinted skull we're
also looking for a trinket okay you know
what there's tinted skull hello tinted
skull
and this run is now like easy wind
territory i'm just hoping we could also
get like a trinket at some point
um the trinky can you get a trinket from
jar of everything
apparently not okay all right
can you get a trinket from sax
apparently not can
you uh can you get a trinket
help me from
finding your car keys
can you get a can of corn and i'll be
all right i hear ya
golden key no thank you that dude you
wouldn't
you honestly wouldn't a full run without
a trinket is not plausible
you're telling with with 200 000
trinkets in this game
that have effects that nobody knows
you're not going to give me a single
trinket
i don't see it happening
i'm begging you don't make me rely on
the one in 12 chance that we get a red
key from mom's chest
oh dude what let's go 1 in 12 chance for
it to do nothing
let's go baby
you love to see it that um
that that shouldn't be happening
i can't believe it
we do a little trolling here is the
thing do a little trolling
i mean it's my fault i guess in the
first place for expecting to
get a trinket i took it for granted you
know
pushed you too far took you for granted
thought that you needed me more more and
more name the song
we're rant jamming but nobody's naming
it for a dollar no it's
it's called boys don't cry it's by the
cure
there you go wamilton got it okay
um it's all right life goes on
look at that .06 damage upgrade there's
a what about this gray chest
you know that's got to trinket inside of
it man you just know it
what's happening to isaac
could still find one on the mausoleum
but i'm just a notch in your bed post
and you're just a line in a song
there's a super secret room potential
yeah yeah i mean you're not you're not
joking
go check that gray chest back there
it's worth a key
lord forgive me you're about to turn me
into the joker
that can't be there all right you know
what we're gonna fight mom we're gonna
we're gonna move on with our lives
let's let the game do the work that we
needed to do let's put our trust in the
game it's never steered me wrong
like on this run i was complaining we
didn't get a damage upgrade i whined
about it endlessly and then we ended up
getting
uh epic fetus no problem
if you believe whether you believe
or you don't you're right you ever hear
that
name that song it's not it's fit or
happier by
radiohead off of okay computer
okay give me give me the give me the
negative man
give me the negative fool card me
take me out of here dude did they make
it more obvious that the
no it's just that the negative is more
visually striking
dude what you know what you shoot at me
guess what get extinguished i did
that was just anger management right
there
i'll do it again i don't care i told you
i'm becoming the joker i'm going off man
this is too much
on on a day where i talked so much about
what a beautiful game this is
this is this is how you repay me
no trinket they did give me the best
item in the game probably but like apart
from that
i'm upset i'm annoyed
what is the space bar item it's a really
cool item it takes 12 rooms to charge
and then it uh when you press the space
bar it laughs at you
and uh it uh does absolutely nothing
it's it's really neat it's a it's a very
interesting
twist on what because what you normally
expect is like when you charge up an
item it would do something
but we have uh we've entered a new era
we're through the looking glass where
you can press it and it gives you uh
it gives you zero i think it's the kind
of subversion that that we can be uh
thrilled with
i don't think you can get a trinket
through it unfortunately i am i'm
burning up like a jonas brothers song
though because people told me
there was a uh
a poker chip trinket on one of our
members only
shops that's that's the kind of thing
that'll keep you up at night
how did we not take damage there oh my
word
just let me out
lord forgive me you're gonna make me
you know what i've decided we're just
gonna bomb our way through that room
you you wanna mess with me i'll mess
with you
i'm i've become trapped okay here we go
this time it didn't do nothing it
actually did worse than nothing it
spawned a bunch of enemies on the room
and then didn't give us another charge
when we popped it
what is this what is this item
drink it's guaranteed baby guaranteed
yes sir
yeah i you know what i think it's a
great name for it we could start calling
it the fu
jar
you can use it on eight and then it's
just the worst book of revelations
i mean honestly this that's not
memory that might be a play that might
be a way to get this done
but um i'm also i'm just hoping that
like
i i gotta see what good could come out
of it right
like we gotta we gotta keep trying the
the right time to
to sell on this item is not when it's at
a you know
a minimum we gotta wait till it
regresses to the mean of oh
drink it okay look things are
everything's picking up baby fortune
cookie
that's the first time i've ever seen
fortune cookie pay out with the spirit
heart
i've only used it about 10 times but
still like all the luck is coming around
baby
let me out
everything's coming up blessed another
trinket
who would have thought i don't want your
your trash items okay i don't want them
i just want your
i don't i want your money i want your
money
it's damaged for me i want your coins
coins coins coins i want your coins
i don't know if we could even get to
that one in the first place but you know
what
dude i'm out of here
stop it stop it stop it
stop it
more money thank you thank you just step
on the button
okay drop the trinket in this room
yes now
pick up the note
dude there you go that's the dream
how can you have spent our savings
and on the bright side we have some
damage so we can
we can just vibe through the through the
negativity here vibe through the
feelings
is this your last run today um we're
gonna have about a half
a half hour left of the stream
i don't know what i guess we'll try to
squeeze something in i mean we're
probably gonna have like
10 minutes left by the time we uh
by the time we finish this one for
better or worse i don't know we'll we'll
see
could try colluding uh with the
with kate to maybe pivot a little early
today but we'll see
i mean i have been live since like an
hour before the usual time for the
the podcast so it wouldn't be uh
it wouldn't be uh unusual
it wouldn't be uncouth
spare two seconds spare two seconds
bro no there's no way i'm gonna with 13
keys there's no way i'm using this
item to get a golden key okay hold on is
that a third guardian angel no we got
the relic let's go
we're not we don't need a golden bomb
for this stuff okay
it's gonna eventually pay out
it's gonna happen
relic could be pretty sick here
it's a good bit man
it's a darn good bit has chip done it
yet if not i'll steal it for myself
why shouldn't i have it okay okay
there's something
that's not nothing
we got a little bit of everything there
we even got to drink it it did a thing
it's not bad
you know you know what i'm gonna say
it's also not particularly good
considering we waited 12 rooms for it
but
it didn't do zero
yeah that's that's true a free golden
bomb at like eight charges or whatever
that's something you you could use that
you'd be happy with that even in the end
game
tony only took us 36 rooms but on the
bright side we ended up getting bob's
uh bladder a trinket that
i don't even know the name of because it
doesn't do anything
you're not wrong if you had tinted cane
now you're talking look at all the
all the items you could get there one in
every 36 rooms
hello i get i don't look look at that
look at that i'm gonna get him i'm
playing by sound
okay i've lost confidence
hello you minding bitcoins
okay i got a pretty simple rule for this
game if i use epic fetus on you and drop
a bomb on your head two times and you're
not a boss
and you're still alive i'm leaving ain't
nobody
got time for that
gotta be honest like i feel like the
spirit hearts the the dream play here
now
my best coins your little deck
sorry
how many bet coins you got in your
wallet
you invested in dogecoin you little
we're moving we're moving
it's a good voice it makes me laugh just
to think about it
the the only thing that can make me
laugh like that just imagining it is
is that voice and then also remembering
what justin's old pharmacist is named
and it's very immature but it it gives
me every time
it's even just thinking about it right
now i gotta be honest
okay check this out it got me a little
bit
give me a game yeah you know what just
hit me a few times oh no yeah do it
again okay
why so that i have space to pick up uh
red hearts
for um immaculate conception
that's that's my thinking right here
you know what why don't you give me one
of those then
we're probably several hearts away i
don't disagree
should be careful about that at
telepills would not hit the spot right
now
would anti hit the spot look at that
what's his name you can find it yourself
i don't want to repeat it
but it's really good it's a great name
i don't remember what you do but i'm
like 99
sure you're better than what i got going
on right now
his name's so funny doesn't say the name
i'm just saying you're spending some
time complaining when instead you could
just be googling
hc justin pharmacist name and it would
probably like
it would probably pop up as my guess
hey it does pop up look yeah it's on the
news you don't watch the news
oh i'm too busy waiting for the new
episode of one piece oh
then you got nobody to blame but
yourself man
oh you haven't read the the one sheets
today
frank i knew i could have gotten more
random shade at one piece
it's not random
when did your twitter handle change yo
did they roll me over
i i heard some scuttle but from the
folks at blue check headquarters that i
might be
getting my official at instead of
northern lion lp
oh my god it's finally happened
although i will say when i click on
profile right now
it does take me to the profile for danny
richardson
but i think there he probably just takes
a minute to work
oh just give it you just gotta refresh a
little bit
yo it totally now it takes me to my
profile let's go
yo we finally got the
right twitter username bless
up twitter hq
love ya would you look at that the end
of an era
no but i did get uh
i did get at northern lion instead of at
northern lion lp
yo is that coming from money hello
i was uh isaac related
[Laughter]
now all we got to do is wait for
verification to roll in baby
i don't mind updating the social
information everywhere that's easy
enough
that's exciting that's great news look
at that branding
has improved already
you know what you're right we did just
get seraphim okay hold on we're still
doing something on this run
dang that tweet's blowing up oh man this
is doing numbers right now
well
what did they do to the guy who had the
handle it doesn't matter he's not famous
when you're famous you just do whatever
you want it's no problem look at that on
the most cursed run that became the most
blessed run of all time we've unlocked
it
tainted maggie
i don't want to fight you yet i want to
i want to carry the yera rune
for when we eventually get a charge and
then here's here's how i see this going
okay
um here's how i see this going
i'm gonna get a full charge
i'm gonna use the item it's gonna create
a bunch of everything
i'm gonna yeara it and it's all gonna
fall into the lava
on the beast fight that's my expectation
right now i'm excited um
it should be a fun time we'll all get to
laugh and say clip farm
clip farms and then that'll be like a
good way for me to send off the stream
i'll be like thank you
and i'm out of here
ape together strong
that's about if they use that in like a
house sample
that could what is house music
anybody else out there have no idea what
the difference between house
electronica techno drum and bass and
like all
acid jazz like what the what the heck
are all these genres man
everybody else is afraid to ask because
if you ask you're instantly obviously
like not cool
i'm not afraid to ask i know two genres
of electronic music
idm and ambien that's all i got
they're all very different are they
though
or is it just uh
is it like people are like that's not
math rock that's shugey's
tinted post rock you know it's the same
thing
call it what it is you know deliberately
improperly get to
the tuned guitar music for nerds okay
okay don't don't hit me anymore i'm done
with this
different beat style i like the
difference between like a waltz and a
rumba maybe
one two three one two three one two
three
oh yeah this is doing numbers hey hey
i'm literally just looking at chat
as soon as i as oh geez louise
as soon as i unlocked tainted maggie
my brain said we're taking the rest of
the night off
my my last brain cell
gave up like like peter parker in
uh spider-man 2 when he's just he's he
used his spider webbing to hold the
subway car from going off the track
and then they the rest of the new
yorkers have to carry him back and they
go like careful he's a hero
if you'll excuse me young
careful he's bald
it's i will say like doubtlessly i think
this is the least successful
isaac stream i've ever done not in terms
of analytics it's kind of chunking right
now
but in terms of like actually unlocking
like literally anything at all
it's pretty close to the bottom
we did do it to ourselves with all those
tainted jacob runs don't get me wrong
but
wrong place to stand charge
a charge for me
clunk
saved i didn't know i didn't know
get ready get ready man okay
we're gonna die we
what the heck what the heck is happening
here
we got an eternal heart out of something
hey you don't don't rush me don't rush
me
guardian angel maybe i don't i have no
idea where that eternal heart came from
but i'm very for it
please be dead and then like we got to
meme it up okay you got it
you gotta have this item payout with
nothing
saved saved saved
oh no oh god it came through it came
true
it's raining baby
i don't like where i'm standing anymore
we're still gonna die but you know what
it was
it was fun while it lasted well
for like about half of it the rest of it
was honestly like a little miserable but
i just wish that that had been full
health and i walked right into him
[Laughter]
whatever at least we uh at least we
unlocked tainted maggie i don't even
know it slash
marker tainted man



challenge today i've been cyber bullied
uh into playing the cantrip challenge
i'm i'm looking forward to it
call off your dogs it's finally
happening i don't even know
how you unlock this something with pills
maybe or something what the
okay okay your
your your
tainted cane you got a bag of holding
when you press q you get whatever item
was in there i don't okay we don't know
yet
i mean it only goes till mom so i'm
waiting for like what's the
what's the ripoff here we got the mind
okay i mean is am i
crazy this seems like insanely easy
right now
you do you really get an item per room
oh you only get it for the room
really oh you only get it for okay all
right
but if you get like pandora you know
what just hold them man oh you can't
hold more than three okay this is
garbage so like get out of here and then
yam hard we could find a we could find a
way to use that and if you can only hold
three at a time
give me uh give me 30 touch because i
want to cycle it out it's no good
and we only have to beat mom dude this
is
this is easy mode i'm a little confused
but i'm not
too scared okay i don't like that that
much either guppy's paw is a little
spicy but i got nothing against it
i guess we'll use that once am i getting
mine flooded there might be the
slightest degree of
mind flooding that's right dude you know
what it is i always get
uh cow trops and canned trips confused
like cantrip is a spell that you can
only use a set number of times right
whereas caltrops are
things that you just use yum heart i
don't want to see it anymore
are things that ninjas throw on the
ground to
slow somebody down is that correct
can trips are infinite use okay shows
what i know
shows what i know
i got no idea man i got no clue okay
here's the deal
can trips are things that let you draw a
card that's
you know you feel like i should know
that after playing so much slay the
spire
you think i would know but uh i don't
okay easiest play of my life i'm
probably gonna play this challenge like
the the
largest uh coward that's ever lived
but to some extent i'm like you know if
we got good items i don't see a great
reason to
to use them when instead we could just
cycle bad items out and hold good items
for situations that are a little spicier
yeah because then that maybe that's
where i'm confused because caltrops is
also a card in slay the spire like it's
just it's too much man the the
the business and the pleasure sections
of the brain are
intermingling how are you supposed to
deal with that
extra space okay serpent's kiss is
beautiful
succubus is beautiful um
well a parasite is not bad but it's like
it might be the worst out of these and
then let's move on to the next i mean
this is too strong
there we go now i feel like i'm the
right height again i i had to raise my
chairs so that i could feel taller in
front of strangers and now
i'm like now i'm back in in my
place did you see that tweet that justin
um
made about his camera angle where he was
like this is how i'm gonna stream from
now on and it was him like
framed so that it looked like he was a
god looking
looking down i tried to do like i tried
to hold my camera up
and do like a a selfie that made it look
like i was super tiny
um but i uh
couldn't couldn't quite get it to work
unfortunately
and also it just looked like
embarrassing
i was i was disappointed with myself i
was like
you're you're too old to be posting this
kind of stuff
so i will say as well remember last week
i was like you know what i'm gonna do
i'm gonna i'm gonna go to that happy
gilmore house
the house that happy gil or the
apartment that happy gilmore lived in
uh in in the 1995 movie happy gilmore
and i'm gonna take a photo that's like
me going to
making my monthly pilgrimage to
vancouver's most important landmark
the happy gilmore apartment building
went way out of my way to do it
um by the way got there yesterday
and then i went i was gonna post a
selfie but then there was just like a
lady on a bench
hanging outside of the building
and i was just like i just couldn't
muster the
the confidence to just go take a selfie
because
like i i just had a 100 percent odds
like she was gonna be like hey what are
you doing there and i'm gonna have to
explain
like you know like oh you know
you ever see the movie happy gilmore
i felt like she lived there and i was
gonna cause like a whole crisis for her
and stuff like that but
anyway so
i don't know if that tweet's ever gonna
come to pass probably not but
but i was there if you if it brings a
smile on your face
just just to know that i was there i was
there man
i can't prove it but i was there okay
that's too many items
i think we just need spirit hearts like
to beat mom this is like a joke
i'm realizing that i feel like for can
trips we just want to get
items that give us consumables
particularly like demon hearts would be
top of the tier
uh this doubles everything this is kind
of interesting
you know what get out of here i wonder
what if we gave ourselves conjoined
how would that work here's the thing i'm
not a coward just send it all man
look at that genius give me some marbles
whatever honestly just like i don't know
just just clean slate give me a clean
slate here
down to the next floor
have you seen bad trip uh
yes in fact it's like the most recent
thing i actually watched
deliberately on netflix and i also want
to point out
a lot of people were talking smack and
now you don't have your finger on the
pulse of the nation anymore
what was i saying a week ago i was
saying like i feel like we're kind of
past
peak netflix netflix did its quarterly
financial report yesterday
all i'm gonna say is that their new
subscriptions were 50
lower than they projected and they cited
um that there was uh oh farticus thank
you
much appreciated dodged by the way but
thank you
they cited increasing well kovit 19
delays for like their prestige content
which makes sense and
nobody can really fault them for but
also increasing competition from other
services particularly disney and
hbo max
i'm just saying and now everybody in
chat is like
nobody was saying like we doubt that
everybody was saying you're absolutely
right
you can go back man you can go back and
look
people were like disney plus will never
they will never release a falcon in the
winter soldier series
and then man spitting out serial.jpg
i'm safe i'm not owned i'm not owned
spelunker's hat
what do you do on this challenge you
just shoot and dodge right like that's
it
[Laughter]
that's that's all what the heck is this
neptune
probably neptunis i forgot we had that
once and i made fun of it
neptunis it's so good uh
you know there's no secret room here but
i don't like this item so just get out
of my face
and give me this item instead now we're
talking and then we're going to drop
some tnt on your face
so we're going to drop some tnt on your
face
just get a stacked deck for mom i mean
it's mom you know like if
if i just have like an orbital we got no
problems man
he used the the blanket a room before
the final boss or room before the boss
so true ha so true
you're lacking damage thank you for the
mulligan dude i wonder can you farm up
uh
like items from the enemies because that
just came out of nowhere i guess yeah
and then you get
when you get starter deck it gives you
like cards equal to the empty space in
your inventory
still excuse me i would like this why
not
metronome for blood of the martyr blood
of the marty
i don't see this being a problem
damage is a little annoying admittedly
but we do have bombs
t-melty
lard no thank you i would i would prefer
to drop it
actually no i wouldn't it doesn't give
us spirit arts but it's not going to
lose us any either
i mean we're halfway through the game
already here okay starter deck
use it not bad not bad
not good okay down to the next floor
anyway that's all i got
[Laughter]
i uh i felt like uh
i i i for some reason i know netflix man
remember there was like a couple of
months ago i was like i bet they have
200 million active subscribers and then
they were like yeah we got around 200
million active subscribers
i was like i'm so smart and then i was
like your business is ruined and they're
like guess what you're right again and
i'm like what
dude i should work for like a netflix
competitor
i guess i technically do now that i
think about it
in in so many ways it's like when when
they were
smack talk in the
the amazon game studio i was like yo i'm
not saying i disagree with you but
let's just tow the line here let's let's
lick the boot a little bit you know
we got a good thing going here um okay
see what we got we can clear it
we can clear it we can hold it dude oh
you think if we use this on the room
before the boss
we could um
generate an orbit and that's not going
to give us an orbital it's going to give
us starter deck you fool
did amazon ask you to say that the
netflix catalog is trash no i'm a free
agent i'm an independent consultant for
tax purposes
um so i that means i can say how i feel
i just don't want the parent company of
twitch to go out of business
that would be bad for for me i think but
i've i've said many anti-amazon things
like for example
um amazon prime is the third best
video on demand platform out there right
now
unless dude though if you like forensic
files or
the real unsolved mysteries
then it's is number one
what's first and second you don't make
me don't make me do this okay
cause you know you can't even
don't make me do it it's disney right
now just just for now
i i'm i'm not saying for life but
for the time being disney is the disney
plus is the better service
it's the more not universally but for me
personally
there's more shows and movies i want to
watch on disney plus right now than than
any other platform
if you want to watch uh the guy who
produced
everybody loves raymond eating shakshuka
in algeria then netflix is the platform
for you if you want to watch
you know high budget original
programming then you know you know where
you gotta go
you gotta go with the mouse for now
i actually like somebody feed phil i'm
not trying to
i'm not trying to rain on the somebody
feed phil parade but
okay thank you and now just beat the
challenge for me
hbo max there's some interesting stuff i
mean i got nothing against hbo
is this this is our second no we got two
more floors
i'm gonna be honest with you i don't
know i don't know if you were concerned
i don't know if you were like
let's um you know give vanello a
challenge like he's a huge fan of or
something like that
kind of feel like it's got to be done
don't get me wrong but i kind of feel
like i'd rather be on a tainted jacob
run right now
it's a nice little warm-up don't get me
wrong but i mean if you're gonna t melt
then then just t-melt me
this is this is a pseudo tea melts
thanks for the range upgrade
team team out will return in guardians
of the galaxy 3.
it won't return today it will return at
some point we got so much stuff to
unlock
you gotta you gotta trust the pilot chat
this is like my favorite meme from the
from the repentance era i've been doing
this a long time
i'm trying to think of like there's some
examples where like we played a game
like on the nlss for example
and then like we we meant to play it for
an hour we had so much fun we played it
for two hours
um and everyone's like it's the greatest
thing
they ever played on the nlss
nothing has ever been greater than that
and then we play it one more time and
people are like actually like it's kind
of a snooze now i think they overplayed
it and now it's like uh
it's not as enjoyable as it once was
that's what we got to worry about with
team elk you know we gotta we gotta
divvy out the team out bit by bit we got
to store some in reserve so that when we
need an emergency
pog injection we can just drop it in
there other like if we
the cardinal sin would be if we
whatever would be if we t-melted so much
that nobody ever asked for it
i would rather have people ask for it
for a long time because they're like
they actually enjoy it
than have people like burn out on it and
never want to see it again
that's my belief
trust the pilot you're welcome to
co-pilot but trust
uh trust the pilot don't even get me
started on will you play london 2012
ever again
i'm just waiting for
the like i think i understand how fans
of jrpgs feel
like the game exists
tokyo 2020 summer olympic games game
exists it's out in the asia pacific
region
what do i use here man like this might
be the worst item
out of we got a great deck here um
the game exists all i want is for you to
actually
like release it in north america but
they keep delaying it
to not put it out
until the olympics actually happen which
makes sense
for marketing don't get me wrong but on
the other hand is like really
annoying because i'm like it freaking
exists man just let me
look no discerning customer is gonna buy
this game to begin with it's only gonna
be like
fools like me and like eight-year-old
kids just let us let us get some access
to it man
yeah that's why i'm i'm that's where
i've got the uh
i've got an overlap with like jrpg fans
man
we're in the same boat you're like the
game exists just
release it and they're like okay we're
gonna release it but we're gonna uh
reduce the bust size of the main
character and they're like not like this
not like this i didn't know what i was
asking for
i just consider myself anti-censorship
in any
con okay anyway hold on let's get get
toasted man
get get toasted
this is harder than the mom fight
and if you disagree freak you
ah the dodging the dodging
it's it's tough man it's tough
it's it's a little tricky it's all right
it's all right
can of corn can't it just stood there
just stood there and took it
don't you go ahead and tell a frag me i
got an idea what have you just popped
out of you know right next to me
intellifragged me
saved you get too much hp my man
i mean you don't i just have base damage
because of the way the challenge works
i was trying to think of this is the one
that corey was telling me about but i
think i think cory got mine flooded by
the
hot potato challenge i haven't done that
yet
i thought you would be i was playing
chicken with you i thought you'd be dead
what do you got for me range plus
luck oh strange attractor we'll just get
that out of the
equation duality has no impact
whatsoever
dog's got a bone by the beta band black
hole's pretty good let's get duality out
of here
kamikaze i mean dude to get one extra
bomb it might be worth it
dank depths too okay we're almost done
when are we gonna get a funky variety
stream hey i did turn on
uh funk champ by the way
funky kong dm'd me and said hey is there
like uh
any of these in emotes you might be
interested in adding to better twitch tv
and i was like you know what these are
all pretty good but
funk champ reigns supreme for me
so you can go you can go ahead and you
can you can type
funk champ at your uh at your leisure
if you're interested in that kind of
thing more more power to you
i'll admit by the way this is like this
is boomer challenge
and all i mean by that is that i'm doing
the thing where i'm like i refuse to
alter my play style at all and i'm like
i don't know if i'll really dig this
challenge
but in my defense um you know
i'm old i guess i guess this that's my
defense on that one
there's many other um
funky emotes by the way one of them was
there's like
jorts but it's monka s
i don't i don't remember what the i
didn't turn it on but it's called like
like jorta s or something like that
it's pretty sweet a lot of a lot of love
went into those
okay don't throw that would be
embarrassing
golden razor nobody even knows what it
does so let's just
let's just dump some of these and then
move on
[Laughter]
i've already seen them on twitter like a
real funky fan more more power to you
it's a great emote plus like i got to be
honest
i know there was obviously the drama
surrounding
pogchamp uh i got nothing wrong with new
pog champ
aka komodo hype but it just like it
doesn't
get me in the same way you know i'm not
like against it but i'm like it just
doesn't
release the same chemicals from my brain
so maybe funk champ can can be like the
the
people's champion the people's pog
champion
it doesn't hit the yeah it's like you
know i think it's like a new coke type
thing you know
just i i wish that it it it elucidated
the same feeling of pog but
it just doesn't for me and it is what it
is you know
it's a it's a you got to do what you got
to do but
come on man come on man i don't want to
be here
let me out
there is um
is it pog baby on the discord is pretty
good that's the
isaac but doing the pog face
i mean obviously you know what yeah give
me some flies man
i could use them
what am i i slipped ribs sure why not
mom's mom's
uh ring mom's bracelet i
it didn't it didn't work i was gonna
pick i was gonna pick up some of the
skulls
okay lil lepalian is pretty good i'm
trying to think
at this point i think we just want to
stack up for the boss like
and stop taking so much like
ridiculously dumb damage if possible
appreciate that one thank you i have no
idea what that is
but
sorry little abaddon not little i mean i
know
apollo apollyon abaddon
brimstone how many uranus neptune is how
am i supposed to keep all this stuff
going man
how am i supposed to keep an eye on all
that okay just don't use
double tap shield how about that just
don't use
diplopia yet we can make some good stuff
happen here
i mean i think we got it locked up
anyway you the the secret is
you use sigil of baphomet
it kills enemies or not sigil of
baphomet you use little abaddon
it gives you a shield i still took
contact damage i thought i was
invincible pardon
we could diplopia some of this stuff
hold on mama mega that's a pretty good
one
[Laughter]
all right well that takes some of the
the danger out of that one and would you
look at that
can tripped we've unlocked weird justice
card
saved saved top deck lethal



we're back playing repentance
i don't know what we're gonna do though
you you should probably decide before
you hit slash marker what you're gonna
do
but um what we're not gonna do is tinted
jacob right off the bat that's
definitely
not gonna be on the to-do list probably
let's not start with tainted lost either
you know what
maybe tainted is hazel maybe it's time
for tainted as asel
i forget you know he's got um
weak laser and little shotgun burp
weak laser little shotgun burp i'm here
to tell you if you're going
what happened to variety pog my variety
um
i was looking at my spreadsheet last
night of the stuff that i've played and
honestly i i find that the
the complaints about a lack of variety
certainly there's less variety
but we did pretty well on variety
recently
we did chess last week we did siege
even within isaac we did some co-op we
played rain on my parade
we played type racer like we we got some
extra
stuff going on man like it's not we're
not just playing repentance it's i mean
it's like
probably 85 percent repentance but we're
working it
so we played say no more last sunday
yeah we're still working it through
the sneeze kind of sucks but also the
beam kind of sucks
it's tough it's tough
anyway for anybody that hasn't been been
following
um
we did come to a an unbelievable
realization on friday
i'm not um the sneeze makes
enemies take double damage from the beam
what a world
i had no idea that's incredible intel um
we we came to an unbelievable
realization lately the realization
um and and i'm not gonna put my wife on
blast for this
she started doing me you know we've got
a division of labor thanks to the baby
she started uh making the cold brew for
me when she noticed
that the cold brew was uh was out
very nice gesture unfortunately
there was some misinterpretation of the
uh
of the recipe uh and we found out on
friday that for the last six weeks
essentially i've been drinking
cold brew that was one quarter the
strength of the cold brew that i was
used to
and honestly it was like one of those
eureka moments where like everything
fell into place
there's no denying i too was like why am
i a little bit more irritable it doesn't
you know it it feels like i should be a
little bit more resilient to stuff than
this
also why you know every morning am i so
uh flemy like i was i was
having these like these phlegm moments
where i was just like i don't know i
just don't feel like quite right like i
don't feel sick i just feel like kind of
off
and then it all every symptom
essentially lined up with uh
with under caffeination so we we made
cold brew with you know you hesitate to
call it the proper amount of caffeine
um because you know of course for some
people in chat
um there is no proper amount of caffeine
you have to live your life like cm punk
otherwise uh
it's invalid um but the the caf
caffeine that i had this morning oh my
god
i feel like a new man this is like the
the first
it feels like the very first time all
over again like i accidentally took a
caffeine tolerance break and i'm like
i'm back i was
absolutely i was like you know i'm i'm
getting uh
you know headaches and stuff like that
and like like prior to the proper
caffeination i was just like
i was getting tired a lot faster
hold on i'll take it i'm not scared
speed doesn't matter anyway
and people are like how do you not
notice well you don't think about it
right you're like did i have my coffee
this morning yeah i had my coffee this
morning
so why am i feeling like i haven't had
my coffee
and then you're like i don't want to
drink too much coffee to like you know
try to make it feel right you know it's
just one of you when you assume it's
sorted you kind of like
it's like when you're troubleshooting
i'm gonna say no to this by the way i'm
gonna try to maybe we'll do angel deals
which means we shouldn't have gone
into it um but it is what it is
okay we probably won't take that um but
it's like troubleshooting you know it's
like when you don't think that the
problem could be that you haven't reset
your modem
then you don't even worry about it you
know you just
you you say that can't possibly be be it
it's got to be something else hey vencia
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
it did taste a little different but it
like
it always tastes different like every
batch of cold brew is like its own
its own beast you know so some slight
differences in concentration or
consistency you kind of you know it's
par for the course
he there oh thank you hello yeah it's
you know it's a micro brew
what's curses hazel's thing
um he doesn't fly
and he his brimstone laser is kind of
weak
however i'm not i'm not a huge epiphora
man
honestly um he has this
little sneeze brimstone sneeze brimstone
does decent damage
uh and apparently this is news to me but
it makes enemies uh take more damage
from real brimstone too
so there's there's a lot to like there
he has no style he has no uh grace
this character has a funny face
oh you can knock enemies into the wall
too you really think i won't
knock you up against the wall okay
phrasing on that one
thanks for nothing prism mike you got me
caught in the in the box hammer you made
me get an accidental bonk
thanks for nothing
dude i gotta tell you i i've got media
anecdotes and everything as well
like kaden and i watched the first half
of
the 50 shades of grey movie on well last
night on saturday night
i had always heard that that movie was
bad uh only
by watching it did i realize how
actually bad it is
like it's it has some of the worst
writing in a movie i've ever experienced
in my entire life
actually not a terrible movie
don't care didn't ask plus you're horny
okay i'm sorry that we didn't have to go
that far
but it is not like just like twilight is
not
good i've only seen new moon twilight is
not
good but it's
also made for uh not my demographic
right it's made for uh
a young adult audience for the most part
so you know no sweat fifty shades of
gray is definitely made for adults based
on the fact that the entire
entire middle third of the movie is just
literally like
fornication scene after fornication um
but it's like so unbelievably badly
written
like it's it's it's almost
just like is scary like uh
like christian gray talks like a robot
and is like way too
forward and i know you're probably like
i mean that's the point it's like it's a
horny thing
but like literally uh you know on on the
second date that they go on he's like
yeah get in uh
my helicopter where are we going oh
don't worry about it
also you know like you i'm gonna take
you to a city that you know you don't
even live in and then just stay over at
my penthouse i mean like they're in love
or whatever so it's okay but
it's it's written as like i would say
what a teenager's
um fantasy of what romance is like
i don't know as an adult i was just like
yo christian gray you know you can't
just take me out of this city on like a
thursday
you know i i got work in the morning
like i got roots
i got uh you know i i can't just uh
go on a surprise i guess she was a
student but still
anyway it's um you can tell it has its
roots in fanfiction let's put it that
way
and then like i read the synopsis of the
sequels because i was like i gotta know
where this goes and it's it's crazy man
becomes like corporate espionage and
kidnapping and stuff like that
it's very strange
[Laughter]
yeah christian gray come on i can't i
can't leave uh portland man my sourdough
starter needs to be fed
i'll do it i regret it
oh well life goes on
bro my scoby my scoby's gonna die
anyway it's like yeah and it wasn't i
don't know i mean what do i know right
again this is also not really made for
my demographic i think it's made for
like
horny aunts but uh
was like i don't know this guy isn't
he's just kind of he's a weirdo
is that is that the is that the fantasy
you have is getting seduced by like the
weirdest man on earth
just once i would have liked to have
like heard and be like
you know like if christian grey just
sneezed like at one point during the
movie
i would have been like hey at least he's
like a normal human being
i was waiting for him to get like a
nosebleed but it would be like ridley
scott style like alien milk like it's
just it's crazy
he doesn't i he's like lil wayne's uh
worst album he is not a human being
anyway we also finished um
the falcon and the winter soldier
no disrespect um
the way i described it in today's isaac
episode i said um
i thought it was okay but on a marvel
scale
from thor 2 to
thor ragnarok it ends up somewhere
around ant-man and the wasp
no no spoilers you know it just
so parts of it were just like a little
half baked i guess
and then i was i was kind of reading
like why it might be a little half-baked
and people were like
oh originally like there was supposed to
be like a plot
um where like 50 they were gonna like
genetically engineer like a virus that
would
eliminate 50 of the world's population
in order to like
you know re-engineer the the thanos snap
or something like that and i was like
okay that you know
i can i can understand why they might uh
they might have considered it necessary
to kind of
uh rework the plot there once kovitz
started to pick up
get him you can get him you can get him
dude i didn't get him
yeah also what happened to the boat man
i'm only watching for the boat at this
point
oh you got him oh okay i got him yeah
that's what i said i got him
easily
there was there was some cool stuff in
it but i was like you know i just
i don't know i i ended up having watched
both of the series now i'm like
or both of the marvel uh disney plus
marvel series
one division was uh left a better taste
in my mouth for sure
but you know it still wasn't bad looking
forward to seeing what goes on with loki
hopefully it's some kind of like
intergalactic heist movie or something
i will say i was laughing at myself like
i take myself seriously but i also
have a great ability to mock myself for
example um
i'm bald um but like one of my main
criticisms
that i had about the the finale of the
falcon in the winter soldier without
spoiling anything is that it was like so
on the nose
i was like come on you don't need to
like just come out and say it like that
constantly and then you know like like
the audience is smart they can figure it
out and then i realized like
you know you're watching a movie or a tv
show i should say
about like uh
a man with wings who's called the falcon
and i was like maybe maybe they do need
to come out and say it
you know maybe this is uh
it's the sort of thing where they don't
really do subtext in in these sorts of
properties and instead they uh
they simply do super text
i saw anthony mackie at a film festival
once and he seemed like kind of a d-hole
look i got nothing for against and well
no i have two things against
anthony mackie okay one of them
is he was in that um
black mirror episode that made me lose
all hope that the series would ever be
good ever again
uh yes striking vipers that's correct
and then the other one is um
in avengers end game his goatee was
weird
that's not meant as an insult like to
him as a human being
i more just wondered what the heck like
the i don't know if it was wardrobe or
whatever but
like what what they were thinking when
they were like hey give him this weird
beard
it just did not work for his face at all
and i found it
very strange but apart from that you
know
he's an actor i mean
i don't know like i feel like if i were
an
actor i don't know if i would
necessarily be that nice of a guy
either like if you saw me at a film
festival or something like that
i just think like you know if you got
into it like for acting
and then they're like hey come out to
the red carpet at the telluride film
festival
by the way if you have low blood sugar
like people will hold it against you
and post about it on reddit for like a
decade afterwards
you'd be like man can i just like stay
home i guess it's part of the job but
oh like you're doing right now
yeah no i'm like i mean i've never had a
fan interaction where i was a dick for
sure
i mean i'm just like i'm only an
to my friends
you know the strangers i'm i'm very
polite although
you know if you take too long in the
grocery store i might talk about it
afterwards but like
i i treat strangers politely i just uh
you know occasionally strike too close
to the bone on my friends
um but then i apologize quickly
afterwards
at least the way i uh it was by my
standards at least
[Laughter]
but still i'm i don't know even being
like z-list
famous i guess i'm cognizant of the fact
that like if you ever had a bad day in
public and like
you know snapped at somebody even if you
know you kind of felt like they deserved
it like it could become the kind of
thing that would
uh be used against you like forever
i guess i'm i'm i'm more like uh hold on
what post this we got here
oh we got the alt path posted okay so we
should be actually going for like boss
rush
here or um
or hush okay so it i appreciate that
thank you
that's a good get anything after mom
would count
but yeah i mean like i don't know i feel
like
this is not going to be the most popular
take but sometimes
i'm like you know celebrities a little
weird not not to say that i have
experience with like anthony mackie
level celebrity
i've never been in the hurt locker um or
striking vipers for that matter but it's
like you know
you're an actor but then like your job
is not just acting your job is also like
you know uh
being part of the marketing marketing
machine
and being judged for it i guess i don't
know i'm not trying to say he's got it
hard it's just kind of a
it's like a weird uh a weird ancillary
duty to have when you're a celebrity
i'm going i'm going for both man why not
i guess like the way i'm thinking about
it is like you know
if you have like a good job in public
it's not enough to just be like
or if you have a good job it's not just
enough to be good at the job
you also have to like never have a bad
day in public
otherwise people are like hey didn't you
realize that like
the other part of being in the marvel
cinematic universe is that
even if a fan is being like weird to you
you can never snap at them because then
it means you're not appreciative of your
lot in life and i'm like i mean i don't
know maybe he's just kind of like
maybe he's just hungry maybe he's a
 yeah i don't know even if he's
a
you know or a little impolite or
whatever you know he's he's just playing
a man with wings
it's not that big of a deal
to me at least but you know i wasn't the
person that uh
that he said oh like you're doing right
now too oh no okay hold on
this is pretty bad
this this changes things um
yeah maybe he accidentally had one
quarter of the cold brew he was supposed
to have
you ever think about that no one ever
considers that
okay so we're not gonna do boss rush we
might be able to make hush but more than
that we should just try to survive to
like the dark path
and i actually i know we don't have to
do alt path
however i'm gonna get the knife just
because uh
we've already gotten half of it you know
we might as well so it's good damage
it's a good familiar
dude i didn't know zazel was this slow
man
yeah this is not hard i mean we could
die don't get me wrong but it's not hard
why do we have um
times one life like we have guppy's
collar
did they rework guppy's collar so it's
not a question mark anymore
oh it's a it's a glitch oh okay
what's b y o b b what is the b stand for
uh bring your own beer what about the
second bee it's a typo
help help me thank you
there you go
anyway that's my thoughts on uh the
anonymous story of anthony mackie
maybe being a little bit of a dick
at a film festival suffice it
to say i give him a little you know i
give him the benefit of the doubt
not knowing the specifics of the story
huh huh
like you're doing right now i just want
to see what this card is man
a little bit of a deck you might check
coins yellow bench
yo well worth it
i guess it's always the hanged man for
that yeah it makes sense
so he gets a pass because he puts on
some weird wings on tv
no it's more like i guess it's less of a
pass and more of like the idea that
you know if if you see someone being an
a-hole in public and they're not
an actor you don't go like oh i saw this
dentist being a butthole you just go hey
i saw
you know someone was having a bad day in
public
if anything i'm just saying you know you
treat him like the the same way you
would treat somebody else having
a bad day you make fun of them you know
behind their back
[Laughter]
uh okay so we're just going straight
though we're probably not making hush
either but
yeah that's the other thing i mean again
without knowing the story
i'm not saying there's no times that you
know celebrities like snap on people in
public like i think we've all heard um
and by all i mean me 5 000 times which
is
approximately one per capita uh the alec
baldwin's uh voicemail where he yells at
his own like 12 year old
daughter and calls her a little
you know
that that one definitely comes across as
some heavy weirdo energy
um
that being said there are some times
where i'm sure like you know
some of the stories of celebrities
behaving badly in public i bet is
actually like the person that like
is telling the story came across like a
little weird you know like
they were just like hanging out with
their kids at like a baseball game or
something like that and then they were
like
oh george clooney george clooney do you
have anything to say about uh
uh batman do you have anything to
remember when you were in that terrible
batman movie what do you think about
that and you're probably like hey man
just like
just trying to watch my kid play
baseball or something here i mean this
is a perfect straw man this
situation i literally just made it up in
my head but
there is the great story though about um
it was like have you ever had i saw it
on reddit have you ever had an
interaction with a celebrity
and then it was um this guy was like
yeah i was at the
this gym at like 5 a.m in los angeles
and it was just
me uh and then wouldn't you know it john
travolta came in and started making like
conversation with me and you know asking
to spot me and stuff like that
and everyone was like dude i don't think
john travolta was there to work
out man like not there's anything wrong
with that but i don't think he came in
to get his
his reps in i think he was there for an
alternative purpose
which again is fine but it's just that
the the guy had no
idea and then he had a picture with john
travolta as well
is it's so good
yeah it's like hey buddy i think john
travolta has a gym
at home to be honest with you
hello simvicta hello
okay thank debs too we're good
why was john travolta there um it would
be irresponsible
to speculate
bill murray once came up to me and stole
one of my french fries and then he said
nobody will ever believe you yeah no
okay we've all we've all heard this
we've all heard the story
we've all heard the story about bill
murray
i got i got on the elevator with bill
murray and
he got off on the fifth floor and then
before he got off he hit
every button on the elevator and said no
one will ever believe you
okay we're going let's go dark path as
always now
no thank you oh you mean like you're
doing right now
what's the other copy pasta the one
that's like fine i'm not hungry anyway
bill murray i don't know he seems look
it's tough right
i think that if
when you're 25 and
worried about the the fact that you're
gonna change into like uh
a responsible adult when you get older
the idea of you know being bill murray
at age 70 is kind of inspiring right
he's going to south by southwest um
and you know getting behind the bar and
making the drinks and stuff like that no
matter what people
order he just gives them like a shot at
tequila or something like that
you know it sounds cool but also like i
feel like
if my grandpa was like if i heard that
story about my grandpa i'd be like are
you
are you like spiraling right now are you
okay
like do you need to talk to somebody
it's it's just uh i mean it's
it's kind of cool maybe
and there i suggest maybe even a little
based but also like it could be like a
cry for help as well
i don't know
i don't i don't really want to and it's
fine if you want to be like that at 70.
i don't really want to be like that at
70.
i want to wear like you know
i want to wear windbreakers and and
shorts and like
go on walks every day and like you know
just just be kind of like like boring i
guess is
that's what i want is 70. yeah i wanna
dude honestly
like the older i get the more that the
idea of like
those not a retirement home that's like
a nursing home but a retirement home
that's just kind of like a cool uh
a cool community for like you know for
seniors it sounds kind of fun right
lawn bowling like you you can't do lawn
bowling like without an excuse
until you enter your 70s you know we're
in the middle of culver right now
there's this uh
there's a hot button issue in vancouver
you know what it is
um there's a a park in port moody
which is uh a suburb outside of
vancouver
it's his own city i guess it's not a
suburb but um
and there's a tennis court people are
mad
because instead of playing tennis at the
tennis court
there's some senior citizens there
playing pickleball
and i guess pickleball is like a lot
louder
than uh than tennis
like the ball makes a much more uh
annoying smacking sound or something
like that
and i'm like dude this sounds like the
kind of problems that like i want to
have
when i'm 70. i want to be like
complaining to kate i want to be like
why the heck you know they just let us
play pickleball what's the problem you
know or i want to be
like how dare they play pickleball i
mean i'm not saying you can't play
pickleball but like
do i so loud you know like i want to be
on either side of that debate man
that's in you know they're they're
living in like a different world
with with fake problems
it sounds kind of nice honestly
oh we're gonna make hush what side are
you on
i don't know like i mean
the obvious choice to begin with is who
cares but i'll admit i don't actually
know like uh
i don't actually know how loud
pickleball is so i i couldn't
hypothesize but you know if it's
insanely loud and there's like
you know the the court is right next to
your house or something like that then
i can understand why you would feel
annoyed that it disturbs the peace a
little bit but
my hunch is that i'd be like hey you
know when you live in a place that has a
large amount of population
please sneeze on them thank you um you
gotta you gotta
you know accept that sometimes you're
gonna you're gonna hear noise you know
that's
when you get the good parts of a
metropolitan area you've got to accept
the bad parts as well
did he say he liked it were we talking
are you talking about 50 shades of gray
kate
he said it was really bad i so this is
um very uh i mean it's not really bonk
it's almost like anti-bunk
um let's see how this works
but oh god it's horrible
maybe wait it's awesome i don't know um
i i don't know um
i i had to go to bed but kate stayed up
and watched a little more and then when
she came to bed
she said and this is you know if you're
watching with the with a young crowd out
there you might want to cover their ears
temporarily
um but she came to bed and said um
what's vaginal fisting
and i said you know it's exactly what it
sounds like
and then she was like no
and i was like yeah i think you know
i don't know the specifics so but
i'm pretty sure uh you know it's one of
those things that's
that's eponymously named
it's named after itself
okay so i i gotta hunch with pop here
okay
what if we just create a staggering
amount of eyeballs
all in roughly the same location
and then we run in here and just stand
like right there you know what i mean
it kind of seems to work you might have
to move the shot like
off of them and then back on or
something or they they can only get hit
by one of them
i don't know mate or like they can only
get hit by each one one time or
something
it's kind of working dude we're also
getting saved with invincibility
so we're gonna we're gonna die we're
gonna die
um but on the other hand
this is also like i i take a great
amount of pride in knowing that we're
like
one of the few streamers who's truly
lived you know
i don't okay i shouldn't be standing
there
it's actually like kind of almost
working
it's so weird one for sure this isn't
living
there's more to live and then only
survive in cine i'm not
there but i'm still trying if you feel
something i don't know the rest of the
words in this song
it's called staring at the sun oh but
it's by the offspring it's track three
on americana the same album that has
uh pretty fly for a white guy and uh why
don't you get a job
yo you're not wrong what if i could
sneeze him first
how does he know the track number dude i
went on a road trip
kid this is a real kids these days
moment so i apologize
um i went on a road trip with my
grandparents
to nova scotia you know it was like a
four day drive or something like that
um
in order to entertain me they took me to
walmart and they said
you can buy one cd it was just
me my discman one cd and an infinite
supply
of uh double a batteries to keep me
going and i just listened to staring at
the sun
or i listened to americana the whole
time as i i know every song on that
album like
beat for beat in this scheme my life for
roger's brothers
rehabilitate with aliens
to you it's like and i don't even like
that album
is this is still very spicy for the
record
we gotta keep moving it is doing a lot
of damage
the shots are really whipping around now
huh
gotta gotta get gotta get in there
though
thank you knife peace
no no no no
well i don't even know what hit me dude
this is probably the end
i mean i'm in the zone don't touch me
honestly just just kill me there was a
good try
i'm not i'm not upset by that one that
was a fun run a good effort
and i keep a smile on my face slash
marker
pop ruins another one



okay let's run it back again hey jay how
you doing
play some more mlb the show yesterday in
your honor
oh no
that's okay we should not have um we
should have used the full card there but
you know what
it when it's this early you don't you
don't sweat it too much
any good series you'd recommend honestly
like i i don't i haven't been watching
much like you know i on tv
i catch the occasional like documentary
or something
and then like in my opinion netflix has
been like
pretty snooze lately
i'd really like to get a satanic bible
here
um i'm
you know i'm just kind of like uh
i'm in a holding pattern right now
a little simpsons yeah watching a little
simpsons
yeah there's a series i'd recommend uh
season eight of the simpsons
highly recommend it if you've never seen
it before okay
not particularly uh
invested in yum heart homegrown simpson
stuff exactly
if you'll excuse me i'm gonna let tomo
into the into the office as well he's
going crazy
just give me a moment here
come on welcome
no don't i hate when he takes a turn
because that means he's not gonna
get into the box hey tomorrow
yo so someone said watch alan partridge
can i tell you
that honestly i i didn't realize
like alan partridge is not a real person
i
i knew that it was steve carrell or um
steve coogan but i thought that it was
steve
coogan doing an impression of an actual
british dj
i have i've just panicked honestly i
didn't know that he was like a made-up
character
i thought i thought that it was like a
send-up
of a real british media figure
and only within the last couple of weeks
did i find out that that is not the case
hey come on tomorrow you can't be down
in the chords buddy
you can't be down in the courts
get so much the cats are starting to
shed too
oh my god and then i got like
stubble because i shaved so the cat hair
is getting stuck in like my
my mustache oh my god okay hold on
second secret room
no thank you
uh could be secret room
did you watch mortal kombat no joke
i was gonna watch it uh yesterday
for real um
go take the books good one
um i was gonna watch it yesterday just
to have something to talk about
then i realized like it's not on
whatever version of hbo i have
and if i if i wanted to watch it it was
going to cost me 25 canadian dollars to
rent it
and i was like under no circumstances am
i going to pay
25 canadian dollars to watch mortal
kombat by myself
you must you must be out of your mind
that's in
that's true insanity well this is
unfortunate but
let's check the shop real quick
so uh it was like
yeah i was disappointed i was all i got
very confused as well i was like what
so i have crave and i have hbo and it's
like
i don't know 20 bucks a month but that
doesn't give you the hbo max like
is hbo max a
level of purchase above regular hbo
do you need to have hbo to get hbo uh
max
i don't know how it works it is it is a
service
about over and above hbo
no it's it's a completely separate
service called hbo max
it's only available in america right now
it's so confusing man
that's nice i wish i could get my money
back for watching it
i mean you know what i said like i think
it was literally on
on thursday or friday i was like i i
heard people were excited for the new
mortal kombat movie
and then i saw a clip they posted like a
teaser on twitter
and i said don't shoot the messenger
but this kind of looks like garbage
and uh i've seen some discourse on
twitter let me just put it this way
it seems like there's there's two ways
you can think about this movie right
i'm willing to do this i'm not afraid um
it's it's like my least favorite kind of
of media discourse i guess
is like i love dumb movies but if a
movie
is garbage you end up like being
mischaracterized sometimes when you say
you dislike it right
like oh sorry that it isn't uh greta
gerwig's classic
film you know uh ladybird but
some of us just go to the movies to be
entertained and we don't need to you
know
have to question the the sanity of blah
blah you know you get the idea the human
condition and etc
um but i'm like i love dumb movies
but like sometimes they're just bad like
i think there are some people who who
see dumbness almost as like it's a merit
in and of itself
it's got to be garbage in like a in the
best way if that makes sense
maybe it does maybe it doesn't okay so
this is pretty much what we were looking
for
honestly i haven't seen it so i don't
know
how it factors in you know all i can say
is how i felt after watching the the
teaser
but you know if you like it you
like it but i just i mean it's just the
internet right
you just get annoyed you're like you you
give your opinion on the movie and
people are like uh actually like
your opinion is different than mine and
we gotta find out which one of us is
right
and i'm like well you know if you got a
push i'm right
but if you don't we can just co-exist
we got no problem there
nothing to worry about yeah 50 shades of
grey it was like dumb garbage
i agree
i i had a great time watching it um it's
really bad
and that's why it's it's kind of fun
anyone know if josh was in nebraska
yesterday no i'm willing to um
uh this is not meant to be salty it's
gonna come out as salty
if you live in america you know
you gotta remember it's still
i guess nebraska's in america but i was
going to say it's still
coveted you know and
i know uh you know you've gotten your
vaccinations and stuff like that the
if you want them but uh
you know we're still we're still dealing
with the
the effects of the virus over here it's
not you know it's not that it's not over
here it's like it hasn't even
started to get over here basically
so i think josh is uh not traveling to
nebraska
to fight a bunch of other people named
josh
i think he is uh i think he's
waiting on his uh his shot number two or
something like that
it's my guess streaming
alien isolation yellow chat
yeah still playing the waiting game up
here baby
i don't even know like what's going on
in vancouver like i guess if
if you live in vancouver um you can't
leave vancouver right now
originally i was like i gotta look up
all that stuff and figure it out
um and then i was like no i don't know
like i'm not going anywhere
but we're on i think we're under like
super lockdown right now
in the coof yeah
it's the way i i understand it at least
same in ontario yeah i mean i'm not
going anywhere anyway so like i don't
know
it's not that jermaine to my own
lifestyle right now but i'm like uh
it is a bummer because like my my mom
was gonna come visit because you know
we had the baby and she hasn't seen her
granddaughter in forever
and then ontario was like we're shutting
down for three weeks and she's like okay
i'm gonna move the trip until
inter-provincial travel is like okay
again
and then she moved it like three weeks
or something like that which was a bit
of a bummer but you gotta do what you
gotta do
and then like on friday bc was like
we're locking down uh
like all movement uh for for
five weeks so she moved her trip again
um
let's go check the shop we basement two
dude we're not gonna make boss rush on
this
um and now if if she has to move it
again
then she'll probably cancel it just
because like they're coming in september
anyway if september ends up being okay
um
which is unfortunate but you know you
gotta you gotta remember it sucks
but there's people out there like with
you know bigger problems as a result of
the
as a result of the virus for sure so
more options
yeah that's kind of it like i don't know
i mean it's it's frustrating in canada i
would say
i'm not i i think most people are well i
would like to think that most people are
are living
you know under the the regulations and
like doing
the things that they're supposed to do
to make sure that it's uh
it gets handled as appropriately as
possible but
we did like pretty well i i guess you
know what it is it's like the
realization that
when we thought we did pretty well
because of the virus it was largely
actually probably just the result of
canada's low population
density and the fact that we were hit
later by the virus than a lot of places
and now that we're in like wave three
and
it's been established uh everybody well
not everybody but
there's a large degree of uh
laziness uh surrounding it and
especially the idea like
as soon as vaccines started to uh
come out i think a lot of people were
just like that's it that's the end
and it's like well you know
still got a ways to go especially
because uh
we can't get uh
vaccinated under i think they just
opened up a z for like people that are
over the age or
yeah over the age of 40 which is is
progress
it's crazy to think about though like we
we've had a million cases in canada now
it puts it into perspective when you see
numbers like that right like
i'm like man that's like one in 30
people basically
it's wild
like right now you got like 7 600 people
watching
i don't know it i would hazard the guess
that you know at least a few hundred
people in here actually had coveted
themselves
like that's wild
i've seen people say in chat that
they've had it
you don't have to say no no is like the
default case
it's one of those times you only got to
say yes really
i was thinking i was like you know the
numbers kind of like make sense i think
most people at least
know somebody who's had it at this point
like my grandma had it
i knew it was coming too start me again
i mean what's up with the uh the d100
like it
it just detends i guess it
it doesn't show you what the effect of
the dice is going to be before you use
it
it sucks now bro
please give us pepo g i do i i r dude
this is a good run now hold on
i really like pepo g pepo g is the one
where the
the pepe is writing down in the notepad
right that's
that's a great uh emote
i didn't know this deflected shots too
but i mean i've never used it on purpose
but still
why not uh no i'm not scared i'm scared
i don't know i'm thinking
most characters i don't mind but given
that we're going to be using
our sneeze like up close and personal i
think this is one of the times where
maybe it makes sense to actually avoid
it
enable gotchy bass so that dan can feel
at home that's what gets me man is like
when i describe
gotchy bass to dan and he's like i've
never used that emo before
like like he doesn't even know
he has no memory of the things that he
says
like i'm like you'd any time i i mention
anything business related to dan that's
good he replies with
the emote that goes whatever the heck
that is
and i i try to describe it to him i'm
like damn it's the emo where the guy
goes
and he's like i've never seen that
before in my life
i'm like you're not looking at your sent
messages man
i wanna i wanna talk to dan and figure
out what like the rest of his his
weekend was like
so he he streamed friday at his normal
time in the morning
came back at 11 p.m eastern and streamed
from 11
p.m to 7 a.m uh for a summoner's war
mobile game tournament with a hundred
other influencers
slept for i have to imagine like five or
six hours and then was live again to
play
enlisted uh in the afternoon i'm like
this guy was
he's been burning the midnight oil
got the bag though no question
tier size tears up
how many freaking eye drops are in this
game man
oh whatever light switch you just hit in
the living room kate
all of the lights in my office just
flickered
is just the living room light okay this
everything started uh it flickered a
little bit that's okay
it's just yeah we can use that for
dramatic effects you can you can send
signals to me then
like if you're like stop talking about
this you could you could just flick the
light a couple of times
no but maybe that's for the best
i'm not taking guppy's eye i think i'm
just let's go angel deals man
hello hello baby baby
hello baby baby
that's the baby
did you say like the whatever however
we walked through the 50 shades i i said
that
i thought it was one of those things
where maybe it was bad but it was
overstated that it was bad because taste
makers on the internet are exclusively
like 30 year old guys with beards like
myself
um and the movie's not made for us and
then when i watched it i was like no
actually it's actually just bad fair
enough
it isn't it was i i said uh much like uh
almost every movie uh vancouver was in
it playing both portland and seattle
big ups vancouver very very talented uh
actor
did a great job i i completely forgot
that it was vancouver and then
remembered uh
i was like wait a minute that's not
portland
yeah that's true and then usually i just
kind of joke about
how the movie goes so when the girl was
like
my mom is uh she likes romance
and then she's like
would you would you be making love to me
tonight
and then literally right away i said
he said he's gonna say no i only talk
and then he actually says no i only [__]
and i was like oh no so try to keep the
the f-bombs to a dramatic
minimum like so that these videos don't
get demonetized
yeah it's just
like just why
yeah you're holding the baby right now
you're saying the f word just
yeah you know it's good you got it you
gotta have some decorum in these
situations
i'm no i'm not i'm not gonna go there
i'm not gonna go there okay i'm gonna go
there
it's only i've i've only been streaming
for 54 minutes
i don't need a baby tolerance break
already
well yeah because i thought you were
gonna you know create a power surge in
my office
i love the baby i i make the most of the
baby time
right baby
but i i try to you know when you're
streaming i try to
not yeah but even when you stream for
three hours on saturday i was like let's
not let's not go into mommy's office
let's let mommy have her streaming time
and
you know then she can have her mommy
time after the uh after the stream
you know what i mean
this is gonna impact the
the situation i don't know
yeah not to mention i've been putting
you on blast for the fact that i've been
quarter caffeinated for like the uh
the last month or so too maybe it was
just better for your heart
i don't think so because i was much
angrier like i was pretty
it was irritable like a hundred percent
of the time
and then moreover you you guys aren't
privy to this
i also got roasted once for making the
coffee with my old recipe
kate was like don't do that that's too
much coffee
your your reading of the recipe is wrong
and i was like okay
my reading of the recipe must be
incorrect
and she she was
she was very upset with me is this
is this true or is this false
you see what i mean
[Laughter]
i'm not actually mad i'm just glad we
diagnosed the problem
chad what were we talking about a second
ago before the lights flickered
also what does shard of glass do
oh no it hurt shard of new shard of
glass hurts you right
bro that's so terrible
okay um
so you j you just die
or after you take damage you continue to
take damage is that is it triggered by
anything or is it just triggered by time
maybe you have to find like a red heart
to stop the bleeding
oh my god it's terrible
okay goodbye
i'll see you in a little bit baby there
she goes
yeah this is uh i mean this is a curse
for sure i don't think we're gonna make
it on this one
shard of glass is bad now um
d100 is bad now but you know what
i'm not sweating
shard equals hold r
boss russian hush will be a nightmare
you're probably right but you gotta try
to send it
i will defend the d100 to the grave i
mean it's i mean it's
like a great item right the only thing
is you know when we use it on our last
run
it uh we we basically only had enough
leverage to roll it once and it was the
d10
it doesn't mean it's it's bad but it was
certainly bad in the moment
[Laughter]
this is tainted as asel
it doesn't do all it it doesn't do all
dice effects at once
well i don't know actually you know what
it it it may still do all dice effects
at once but it doesn't reroll your hp
anymore which is the
the change that that got in got us in
trouble
we went from uh we went from one and one
empty to
one and one empty
what songs do you remember
from 1999 to 2000 like ricky martin's
live in la vida loca
um well there's ricky martin's living la
vida loca
there were a lot of like like the latin
explosion was happening in 1999.
mambo number five um was was big in that
period
uh jennifer lopez is waiting for tonight
oh when you will be here in my arms
um britney spears sometimes
and we even had small rock in a while
what the heck i don't know what we did
but i'm for it
yes enrique iglesias by the mouse
uh i would like to heal please never
mind it can't be done this still is
really good okay
hold on we're trying to make okay i'm
gonna go i'm gonna go because i know we
haven't gone to the shop we're trying to
make boss rush though
oh that's holy water i didn't know it
froze
that's something man
was lollipop a song at that time are you
talking about lil wayne's lollipop that
came out like
you know 10 years after that or are you
talking about the lollipop song from
like
the year 1906 that went like you know
either way you're off it's just a matter
of whether you're off by a decade or a
century i think
we were too busy we were rocking out to
the contemporary music of the time
like beethoven's fifth symphony it was
the late
uh it was the late 20th century
mika's lollipop i don't know mika
is it
sm like it just the the voice just keeps
getting higher that mika
yes that mika that's grace kelly
there's a lot of bands from like the mid
well artists i guess from the mid-2000s
that i don't remember
um until i hear them another one is like
the scissor sisters
i don't feel like dancing was the uh
what's what's the word i'm looking for
it was like the anthem
for the the university class the
incoming freshman class one year younger
than myself
and then i i feel like i've heard that
one and then take your mama out
and then they just cease to exist after
that
or the fratellis yeah what what happened
to the fratellis after the chicago
blackhawks stanley cup run
you know nobody knows it's it's it has
not yet been discovered
they just released the now don't look
i got a lot of bad memories uh
surrounding the fratellis
not not just from canucks fandom but
i i had an acquaintance who was a large
fan of the
fratellis and all i remember this is
before the chicago blackhawks
however well before they were good
anyway um
and then that song seared itself in my
memory uh
they were playing that album for me
while they were driving and they were
singing along and just
freaking hoofed it through a red light
and i was like
you know quite apprehensive about the
fact and i was like you went you know
you just went through like a red light
there
and they were like oh yeah my mistake so
that's just like
anytime i hear this song i just picture
me like with my
fingernails gripping into the armrest
okay go faster yeah yeah go faster go
faster
and you never let it go look
it's true i mean i could have died
we don't talk anymore it's not because
of that though um
i have uh i i know i've said this before
mouth good driver but i will say
he has always told the story anytime i
talk about driving he talks about the
one time i was driving him home from
school
uh and i there was a deer on the road
and i didn't slow down fast enough for
his comfort for the
safety we were fine
but for comfort he found himself getting
a little apprehensive
which is fair okay nothing wrong with
that
but he's told that story for like a
decade and a half
i forgot that
malf also has a story that scared me
he was driving me to my me and two other
friends of ours to our friend's house
one time
and uh i swear to god
he turned left on a red light
like like british style
now if you're like that doesn't seem
that bad i have to remind you that in
north america we drive on the right side
of the road
so to turn left against traffic is is
dangerous
um for certain that being said i i do
have to say
in malf's own defense we were driving
in uh an extremely rural area
um and there were no cars coming but he
didn't acknowledge it it wasn't like he
was like
i'm gonna stop and then turn left he
literally just like muscle memory did
like right into the light that being
said
i'd i only bring this up because
turnabout is fair play
mouth one 100 a driver i am uh
i would i would let him drive my my
child
that's i i consider him a very safe
driver
that's that's the greatest compliment i
could give to to somebody else's driving
ability
now are we going to do boss rush with
curse of the unknown you know what it
depends what's in the boss rush
that makes sense yeah i mean why why
doesn't it make sense why wouldn't it
make sense
phrasing could have been better there
could you make your own phrasing better
by telling me how my phrasing could have
been better
i don't know if is it like in a
different part of the world drive means
different things
you could pilot the lorry
okay we'll take the negative
we'll take it's eden soul
um we gotta do something we gotta
oh god pick it up thank you saved save
saved
um but like the the urn is really good
too right
i think this is a quality problem to
have i think this is this is two good
items
let's take the urn because we needed um
we need to get some practice for that
one challenge
yeah let's go earn why not
right choice
hmm all bad
i will take uh
we'll take a little chubby terrible
choice though
let's go
he do be saying alexander hamilton
try shooting that's a nice trick
i will say i'm not sure is the right
item for boss rush but once we get out
of it we're gonna be fine
just endeavor to take as little or not
even as little damage as possible
but whatever damage you do take try to
take it as late into the run as possible
so that you don't get screwed over by
shard of glass
i'm only here once a week every time i'm
here you make a reference to hamilton
let's go if you could in the discord
just send me your schedule and then
and let me know your availability i'll
try to make sure that when you're here i
only make a reference to like west side
story instead
i'd like to mix it up i don't want you
to become sick of it
i'll expand my musical ubra
also uh freaking
well once we get down to lower red
hearts we don't have to sweat it
because we'll we'll have like an
infinite amount of hp on the ground no
sweat
no it's great i'm looking forward to it
oh okay and then why are you only here
once a week
[Laughter]
if you're not bringing it up as an own
why are you only here one out of every
uh
six streams now i'm offended for a
completely different reason
thoughts on the greatest showman i've
never seen it
um and and likely never will would be my
guess
i guess i just i don't have much of a an
interest
but i will say like i feel like once
every oh that's like really bad um
oh never mind it's fine
once every like couple of well maybe not
once every couple of years maybe like a
couple times a decade
there's like a musical that unexpectedly
just sort of like pops off and becomes
insanely
popular i feel like the greatest showman
was that
um for the like mid-2010s
when i was in university it was or not
university when i was in uh
high school the rent movie like really
got
it created a whole new generation of
drama kids
and then um in university i feel like a
lot of a lot of people became enamored
with the film
across the universe
i don't know i feel like because people
are saying la la land
i i guess i was in adults they were like
secluded like when la la land uh
came out i really like la la land most
of the discourse i heard about la la
land was people who were like
i hate it and it sucks and hollywood
just
loves making movies about itself and
stuff like that um
but i uh i i really enjoyed la la land i
thought it was a great movie
why not at this point
we can still make hush too but i don't
know if we got the if we got the power
what the okay
um
it kind of seems great
i also kind of don't want to look at the
screen
[Laughter]
but it does seem kind of kind of cool
maybe
and if we ever get uh annoyed with it
you know we always got this back in a
sub
you know it does look like a ss
cjm you're not wrong
it doesn't not look like sscjm
he do be tiny you're not wrong
if you know then you know
i can't wait for the youtube comments
asking what it is uh
it's a little bit like horny gump you
know what i mean
i was running only he didn't say
running
i don't know that's the sunday crowd the
sunday crowd this
week we keep things a little bit more
pg-13 here try to at least
when we get to the midweek insanity
that's where we start to
well really it's just whenever justin's
on
to be honest which is also fine
dude don't even get me started by the
way hello cobalt hello
okay so like this is not meant to be
like because i know out chad feels about
elon musk right they think he's a cop i
also have you know dunked on
elon musk in the past less for anything
political more because i think his
tweets are just really really
funny but like
like him him on saturday night live is
gonna be
the it's gonna be the worst
episode of television ever created right
like i i didn't tweet it because i think
it's just toxic
but i was gonna reply to the snl tweet
that that announced that he was hosting
and say
finally uh a host befitting the quality
of the show but i think they might have
taken it as a compliment and that is
definitely not how i meant it
like i i genui i'm scared so the show i
think it's on may 8th or something like
that
i think it might actually you know like
how the people were worried about the
large hadron collider
having like two gluons collide
with such force that they created a
black hole or something like that
i'm worried about that happening here
but like with with cringe you know what
i mean
like it's not even that
like i disagree with elon politically or
anything like that
it's that i i just i don't know that the
man has like
a comic bone in his body or or like
like the charisma that would make anyone
think that he's going to
be like a good host for saturday night
live
i i can't even like i just don't know
what's gonna happen
and and i'm a little scared i'm scared
that it might create
like permanent cringe inflation
you know like we we may never like after
that episode
airs i think there will be multiple
clips that will make it so
scott's tots never makes anybody feel
anything ever again
like your cringe muscle is never going
to be the same
it's like you know when you break your
leg it always aches when it rains
you know you're gonna it's gonna be like
that for the rest of your life
you know you're gonna be altered
i'm scared i'm scared for what it means
that being said i also think it might be
must watch television
how would you feel if a chat member
handled your insurance claim tell me
you work in insurance without telling me
you work in insurance
i don't know i don't have an answer for
that i guess it depends on what the
insurance claim was
um if i was committing insurance fraud i
would rather a chat member didn't handle
it
because then like they would spot me you
know talking about all the extreme
sports i like to do
uh on my stream i was mountain biking
the other day et cetera et cetera
but if it was just like you know if
there was like a fire
or something like that and then i was
like hey
like you know all my stuff burned up
here's here's the value i don't think
i'd be too
upset or perturbed that would just be
like cool
you know i think i think
i'd i'd be okay dude i don't know
maybe like let's give it a try
how would you feel if a mod delivered
your mail i thought about that from time
to time
not just because you know of where you
work um but also i was like i'm sure
that every now and then there's like um
there's got to be like an amazon
delivery driver or something this or a
doordash driver that's like yo
what the heck and i guess you just sort
of like
you know you leave it in god's hands
right
how would you feel about a dog playing
basketball
[Laughter]
well can i see the rule book okay so
here's
here we just got to say this in advance
people are gonna be like take plum flute
the problem is plum flute literally
works for like
two seconds and then sucks so it'll do a
lot of damage to whatever phase we use
it on
but like not enough to make a meaningful
difference i think um
we we need to stick with the urn for
sure
okay that was that was a goodbye thank
you for that
hematemesis can get us out of a jam as
well
yeah we gotta stick with the jar man
very nice
it's like but i don't dude i don't
really want like number two right now
it's a good my bad it's a good idea
though by battery for satanic bible
um i don't want number two right now no
no no no no
oh no because then i screwed it up
because i'm taking damage from
sharp plug oh no no no
okay so i'm just i'm just hanging back
for now we got to remember this is a
marathon not a sprint
we could use hematemesis to generate red
hearts to stop the bleeding but as of
right now i don't think it's important
i don't think it's particularly valuable
i was well i don't know we could use
hematomises when we get down to zero
anyway
and then you know it it's still good
it's still good they're still clean
yeah shard of glass produces its own hp
too
just gotta wait for it should not have
walked backwards
i have the urn out i'm not shooting yeah
uh those shots were just coming from uh
shard of glass
[Laughter]
let's go let's go okay now preserve that
as long as possible
i don't know i saw a bunch of red tears
coming out of myself and i was like i
don't remember our shots looking like
that but
you know sometimes in uh
in repentance especially i don't really
know what's happening i just
just hold the button down and and hope
for the best
it's doing numbers man erin is doing
great stuff here
so yeah i don't know i i will say i feel
lucky i've never had to make an
insurance claim at least as of yet
presumably it'll happen
at some point um i guess i've made
insurance claims for like you know
when i when i had dental benefits from
my university but that's like i think
kind of a that's not what you mean
let me see your teeth oh you got your
teeth cleaned let me see oh you had
scaling done let me see your gums
no i've never uh i've never been in a
car accident
um
trying to think of like with other
situations i've never i've never died
so like i haven't had to make like a
life insurance claim or anything like
that
except a deer i did not hit the deer i
merely braked
late and i would also like to say
it wasn't even so late that it went like
skirt
it was just like it was not as gentle of
a stop as
it could have been as well
but i should have i mean i was in the
middle of a conversation
i should have stopped faster though the
deer was fine it's probably dead now but
like
not due to getting hit by a car you know
probably just old age
that was like 2000 2005.
okay that was a very easy fight
um i guess we should do delirium
wait wait we have to okay no no
if we go dark path we beat the lamb
we beat mega satan there's still a 50
chance to get void after that after the
mega satan fight
i did take the negative yeah yeah so i
would rather
do lamb and mega satan for a 50
chance unlocks well it gets more done on
the posted note
and it gives us a chance to do way way
more
right you guys still shoot i don't come
down here that that much
come here often points to chest
yeah the urn's doing great work man no
question there
funk dude we might get some like
in-house uh
dead by daylight matches going
chib's been in the back channel it's
like oh my it's almost impossible to
uh to read the back channel chib's in
there so much going can we please play
dead by daylight and i'm like oh jib i
can't today i got to be like a father
and he's like
shut up play
dead by daylight and i'm like yo just
chip stop cyberbullying me
and he says no
so we might do some some in-house he
might get his way we might do some
in-house uh
dead by daylight matches
no one will believe you chibly please
please i need it
thank you i like that by daylight i was
i was
i mean he's not really cyber bullying in
the back channel but
um i was saying like i
the the one time i played ranked dead by
daylight
it i think it was because we had three
people which is like an awkward number
but
every cue took like 20 minutes and then
sometimes i just like got
hooked right off the bat and was like
this is i don't know if this is the way
it's meant to be
uh experienced uh
but i don't mind like the occasional
in-house dead by daylight i think just
in general you know
hide and seek is a classic uh it's a
classic video game
formula
no chibi will never stream crazy time
again he deleted his account and i
i support him
my bone heart by the way whatever we're
gonna crush mega satan delirium
is like a maybe but we're going to crush
mega state unless something goes
terribly wrong with uh
with with shard of glass
well nevertheless
we got hematomises too so
we we do have a get out of jail free
card not an actual get out of jail free
card which is functionally worthless but
we have like a real get out of jail free
card
something we can use to help us out a
great deal
not yet not yet
we don't sweat it yet
okay three digits are on the money
counter because of deep pockets by the
way
i don't i don't know the specifics of
what else it does
small don't call my azel a baby just
because he's
small like a baby it's very insulting
what does yoda say
prodigious size you you think me weak
because of my size you do
you know he does he does that you know
you remember you saw it
something like that right
do you think baby uh yoda has ever
gone to baby yoga
all what the heck is baby yoga um
boo boo boo minus two
might come on that's like a zero that's
not a minus two
come on man we can still sneeze
this is elon level humor is actually not
okay like don't get me look i'm
like we can't go down this road again i
took too much so too much heat on social
media
we don't have to go down that road again
i'd lea to elon
go the go the ilanites okay
i'm just i'm really really excited i
think he's gonna fit in
really well on saturday night live
i think they're honestly like
perfect for each other
i think it's a great fit
okay we go back for this half red heart
there's still a chance here
and if we lose you know what we could do
if we lose a bunch of hp
just start taking these devil deals man
by the way he doesn't actually jump
weird he jumps completely normally
hey this hey it's all fun and games guys
i'm not affiliated with elon musk at
all but i'm here to tell you like he
jumps
totally normal i don't see why
everybody's saying like he jumps weird
he jumps totally i've seen him jump and
it's normal
my name is noel kasam and i'm here to
tell you that
i don't know why everyone's making fun
of his jump that's how i jump
okay i'm not actually trying to you know
it's okay everything's okay i wish him
the best of luck okay isn't this our
second lard
0.6 speed
i had to had to make a choice on that
one
you ain't nothing but a slow boy boy boy
slow boy
one of the only runs you're ever gonna
see that never gets a speed upgrade
usually those are those are everywhere
thank you thank you it's a little scary
you know i i mean i want to use
hematomisis
but i don't want to use hematomises
because there's a great level of sustain
on oh yeah don't be afraid to use the
urn just chill just chill we're just
chilling
we're chilling there you go
okay earn great stuff
keep it moving look at this look at that
damage we got we got no problems
the rumors of my demise have been
greatly exaggerated
take take rotten baby i i have
considered it but actually like
because we only have like four damage
i'm not sure rotten babies that good
in most circumstances i would probably i
would give it the time of day
admittedly we're not doing anything with
the heart container oh geez
but uh i'm hopeful that maybe we we will
be able to at some point
ah that's a good point guppy's tale for
free items is
is interesting because i forgot on you
wait no all chess
pay out with uh wait does it give you an
extra chance for chess
because all chess down here already pay
out with the
with items it's just oh okay guppy's
tail gives you more chests as well
flies do 1.5 times your tear damage
is that new okay oh you got something
for me
i'll take it
not new oh weird first time i've ever
heard about it
okay holy water if you if you would
please
do i have a like a synergy that's making
a
shard of glass shoot straight
or is that just like you can you can aim
it like because i i thought it just made
the shots like
appear out of the center of you like a
fountain
oh frick what is yellow brim dude i
don't know at this point it's
it's tainted as hazel brimstone
plus almond milk
uh oh that was just like that's just
poor obviously
okay you know it's a little hot
not doubting the heat i'm a little upset
by that damage
let's not do a victory lamp um we owe it
to ourselves to still try to make this
work though
okay keep it going
just thinking okay we're not gonna get
back to full hp
we should take a couple of devil deals i
think that the obvious one is not
rod and baby the obvious one is spirit
of the night so we can stop stepping on
creep
obviously should have done it about a
billion years ago but
better late than never and i think we'll
also
take guppy's tale for extra items and
then
don't get hit hmm
no now now that i've thought about it
for two seconds i'm like this isn't that
bad
one adversary is not that bad and we
start the rebuild
we're gonna have at least three rooms
two
is yeah two is cancel christmas
also apparently any enemy also canceling
christmas
um i think come on
stop i would i need to place the bomb to
find the secret room but
i keep sharp plugging the
bullets away man
or the the bombs away okay there's a
battery charge that's not what we're
looking for
hmm
john madden no
no not not to ghosts not to ghosts okay
this is also not what you're looking for
don't kill me don't kill me
hmm
no promises this should be doable though
i mean we we have to at least try
there's no reason not to at least try to
fight mega satan but
uh we're not we're not generating too
much out of this so here's here's what
you do okay
you accept you're going to die as
um as tainted as asel
that's fine we're going to respawn as
blue baby
how do you win as blue baby um you take
all of these items but especially [__]
of babylon
and then when you die you come back as
blue baby and you hopefully win the run
and and everybody's happy
it's a nifty synergy for sure
don't don't worry too much about the the
pong aspect
i would say just try to keep yourself
going here
dude look at this look looking like a
right angle
okay phase one earns please
almost walked right into the enemy
that's okay
do you still get his hazel unlock his
blue baby no
that hurts and we we did the blue bait
oh
i forgot you spawn outside
we probably did the blue baby unlock in
about 2017 would be my guess
so the this is just for for bragging
rights essentially
we have 2.43 damage
[Laughter]
don't get me wrong we gotta we got a
prodigious amount of laser beams
2.43 damage is a little whack but
but the beams man
i can't believe i didn't get hit
probably not that great for the bit rate
either yeah i would assume
okay good decent start
it's the forbidden spaghetti run
this is a great way to recharge the urn
man
then we squandered our charges but but
prior to that it was a great way to
recharge it
be dead thank you
angel statues i'm not sweating too much
just don't get it don't get it twice not
against
greed
electric spaghetti run
dude this is how i feel when i eat spicy
food
we do have bombs as well you know don't
don't fear the bombs
and by don't fear the bombs i mean like
fear the bombs a decent amount
because bomber boy is actually quite
dangerous but
don't shoot a big brimstone laser don't
shoot
a big brick i know it
dude the scary thing is that this is
with [__] of babylon imagine what my
damage would be like
if we didn't have [__] of babylon on
this one
phase two you know he's tanky
i would i would say you don't want to
put yourself in a position where you
you literally can't be hit or you'll die
but like
there's a chance i would like to see him
get
a little bit of uh a crack on his face
possibly i just need to be able to see
what's happening
good job holy water good okay this is
where like
you just gotta you gotta pray
i can i can't shoot at all times dude
because i get i i get mine flooded by
the shots and i'm so freaking
small i'm so freaking
small dude i can't even focus on my on
my personage
oh my
come on dude you're almost dead just go
just go
go gentle into that good night
okay and then here we go
down to the delirium floor
now that i think about this is for
literally no reason because we've
already done this as blue baby but
it'll be funny regardless so let's let's
try
honestly you can't kill my vibe on that
one i'm still i'm just happy with how we
did it
[Laughter]
tainted his hazel blue baby win
kind of that was still a great run
that was weird but



i'll take it either way it was a great
mega satan fight
all right look what else we got here so
there are some tainted characters we've
never unlocked
lazarus and apollyon still okay you know
what
it's just that easy let's let's just do
a lazarus run and just like
you know get a chance to chill out a
little bit more as well
okay silly jilly
hilly milly
sorry i'm stealing dan's content
yeah i'm surprised we don't have uh
interesting
i'm surprised we don't have uh tainted
uh apollyon yet i think we had an
awesome run and i blew it like i think
i had a run where i played on tilt or
something like that
dude should we get into poker i see all
the all the chess pros are starting to
play poker now
and i gotta admit it's it's got me
itching
i don't know if it would be good stream
content but like i
have said many times i don't really
enjoy poker
but i think that's just because i was
playing it wrong
i really i like math that involves
probability
now of course there's some humor to be
gleaned here i'm sure with the
you know a history of streaming for a
decade and occasionally doing math wrong
and also calling it uh
combinatronics or whatever instead of
the the actual name
for uh for the mathematical discipline
however
i do enjoy um
i do enjoy probability i enjoy for
action math
maybe poker is the sort of thing i could
i could find myself getting into
i do hate losing real money though
that's for sure
that's and i think that's part of the
thing that makes poker you know
fun to watch is people getting uh
you know losing like
not vast sums of money but you know to
watch like a streamer lose like
a thousand bucks or something like that
it's part of the reason people watch it
but i mean i honestly i feel like if i
if i lost 50 bucks in a twitch poker
game i would be like
not upset just upset with myself like
even when i lost
i wasn't mad at myself but like when i
lost uh
to avoid boy in the in the botez battle
which i had a strong suspicion would
happen but still
it was just for fun but also there were
like 10 gift subs on the line
and as i was buying the 10 gift subs i
was like so freaking
stupid so stupid what was i
thinking hey hey
hold up um kill kill me
kill me if you hate me then
kill me
beautiful okay and we need to leave a
trinket behind all right all right
steve madden god madden
okay sorry um there's not that's not
banter that's not banter
we're moving on
i'm not owned i'm not owned
i'm begging you stop doing the inhale
voice okay sure yeah
yeah sure sure
dude you know i was i was looking up the
bagel boss today remember that guy
did you know that in um
i think it was in 2019 he was supposed
to do a celebrity boxing match
uh with dustin diamond also known as
screech from save by the bell
rest in peace uh and he just didn't show
up for the boxing match and then he
laughed at everyone he made like an
instagram live or something like that
where he was like
you morons actually thought i would show
up to get my butt kicked are you stupid
do you think i'm stupid
i didn't like i don't know if he got
sued or something i didn't know you
could do that you could just like sell
tickets for
like a boxing match and then not show up
and but anyway
but then the the part of the story i was
laughing at the most
was when uh
he in the article he said he forgot to
tell his dad that he was gonna ghost the
boxing match so his dad and uncle showed
up and bought tickets
it's so good
anyway i'm sure we can all laugh about
it now
i think if i were his dad i would be
like hey first off you know
you shouldn't have ghosted the boxing
match but then secondarily like you
could have at least told me you know
that
that you weren't gonna show up
it's kind of weird
anyway that's all i got
just reading more about the bagel boss
you see he seems like a very unhappy man
for sure
you don't remember the bagel boss you're
not god or my father
or my boss
you gotta leave a trinket behind that's
right that's right
let's get deals with the angel is
cleaver not worth it
i don't know man every time i use
cleaver i'm like it always
like it backfires on me
i'm always like cleaver pog and then
like
it it turns one boss into two bosses and
i'm like that's not
pog that's that's anti-pog
every impression just reminds me of
angry man yelling on the street in new
york
you don't respect the sesame seeds that
serve as the topping on a foundational
bagel
i've added all kinds of bagels new york
bagels montreal bagels
i've had some meats in ankara you're
nothing
you couldn't you're not fit to consume
even a donut
much less boiled dough that's then baked
sorry i just it's the only impression
i'm good at so i have to i have to do it
whenever i get the chance i gotta lean
into it
you've got no taste
you probably use you've got no palate
you'd use
unrefined reduced fat cream cheese
that's um if angry
man in new york was very angry about
bagels instead of the saxophone or the
trumpet sorry the saxophone is from
deacon blues
i walked gordon ramsay down dog down the
catwalk in hell's kitchen who are you
who are you i'm proofread kitchen
confidential you're nothing
this guy could be your no pixel
character
we'll cross that bridge when we come to
it it seems like a great way to never
have uh vocal cords ever again but you
know
worry about that when it comes to pass
pog
emeritus item
an item of some merit
cleaver plus filigree feather equals
double angel items
bro what the heck is i know it's a
trinket but that would require me to
know what filigree
feather actually does
which is a a problem that as of yet has
not been
uh solved on planet earth
angel statues drop angel items
instead of key pieces is this a recent
discovery like did they have to use a
particle accelerator to figure it out
i've been under the impression that it
does nothing
yes okay recent discovery good to know i
i haven't been keeping up on the
scientific journals lately
it was peer reviewed and everything oh
hell yeah you know be a great
uh journal what if instead of being peer
reviewed things were
beer reviewed i.e
a committee of people who were minimum
six peroni's deep
had to agree on something being printed
that that could be one heck of a i mean
that's a journal that i would subscribe
to
they're gonna do us again they're going
to be like no trinkets for you
that was i was listening to this podcast
and
before they got into the podcast um they
were just talking about like the stuff
that was going on in their life and the
guy was like for my birthday someone
bought me
a cameo of the guy who played the the
soup nazi on seinfeld
and he played the cameo on uh
on the street on the podcast and i was
laughing so hard i'm like i'm not trying
to knock the the soup nazi guy and i
know like
he's like um trying to think of the way
to describe it that's like his job now
is to be like yes i'm the guy who played
the soup nazi
because he he came to vancouver i
remember i think uh
corey either like went to see him or or
was gonna go see him and then saw that
the lineup was like three hours long and
was like i'm not gonna go see him
anymore because that's crazy um
but uh the cameo was so good there it's
like you know
hey cameron uh this is from all your all
your friends at the office uh
heard you were a big fan of seinfeld on
uh
on seinfeld i played the soup nazi
and then he just went like
no soup for you three years all right
thanks for
thanks for all your support over the
years and like it's it's
just wonder what like his the soup nazis
like
life is like now it's not a bad job
if i mean like you you parlayed like a
little
cameo on the most popular show in
history like
up to that time into this thing that's
like still going by the way do it do as
i say not as i do on this but
i'm like he's a genius we gotta okay
there's some red hearts out here but
it's uh
it's very interesting it's it's a weird
world we live in these days right
[Laughter]
like that my job i used to be an actor
and then
now i just uh do an impression
of the character that i played on one
episode of seinfeld and
it's a comfortable life nothing against
it
okay
he's got something good in there you can
tell do i mean that's a good trinket
my work got ice cube to do a cameo at a
recent security event
we make security software is great man
like
it's good stuff that's what i felt like
when
i mean okay so this i'm not trying to
knock amazon okay
because like my fiduciary success like
hinges on them existing and also not
hating me
but um also i use their service a lot
anyway
uh regardless that's kind of how i felt
the champions of fire when they're like
the whole weekend they were like hey you
know chuck the iceman liddell is going
to be showing up at the after party we
got chuck the iceman liddell to show up
and i was like i got nothing against
chuck the iceman liddell
i've never i don't know who he is quite
frankly um
however i
kind of wish
they just didn't hire chuck the iceman
liddell
and instead put like an extra 50 grand
into the prize pool
for the event quite frankly i feel like
that that would have been
like meeting chuck the iceman liddell i
got nothing against it
but to have everybody else get like
another uh
you know 10 on their prize money or
something like that i think would
probably be worth more to us than
meeting chuck the iceman liddell
also he only stayed for like an hour by
the time i got there he was already gone
but
i wouldn't have i probably wouldn't have
waited in line to begin with but
like i was i was thinking about that you
know i don't work
in media in a traditional sense but have
you seen the
new um cheetos ad
starring ashton kutcher
mila kunis and shaggy where me you know
ashton kutcher comes in and goes like
you know hey mila did you eat my cheetos
and then shaggy's sitting in the chair
and
mila goes like uh and then shaggy goes
just say it wasn't you
and then they do like a parody of
i saw you eating in the shower it wasn't
me
i was thinking about like do i wonder
how much shaggy got paid
to literally
just sit down in like a smoking jacket
and say
it just say it was a you like and we'll
end the rights to his song
as well i suppose but i'm like man this
guy
it's a great job
it's the dream you know being a one-hit
wonder i actually think it might be
better than being a two-hit wonder
because if if you're a one-hit wonder
usually the only reason you're known as
a one-hit wonder is because
your first song was so unbelievably
popular
it's almost impossible to match that
level of success
right i mean
then again shaggy he's not really a
one-hit wonder i suppose he's like a
he's like a like a a one
plus four half wonder
dude red red stew
but either way i'm like dude i think if
you had the choice between one
hit song or two hit songs you should
take
one hit song like vanilla ice
definitely has done better by just
having ice
ice baby well like we not withstanding
the
suge knight shakedown but like the the
song can then
later have a second life as
uh like in jingles and ironic like you
know
movie appearances and etc etc
go ninja go is not a
it's not a uh a good song nor was it a
hit
yeah dude if i was a musician that's the
dream you just want you want to sell out
right
no i want to work in uh
you know little underground pool halls
for the rest of my life and apply my
trade to
26 people who aren't even looking at the
stage come on no you don't
you could you could do that but also
have the applebee's commercial
you could have the applebee's commercial
then it gives you it serves as the
foundation
for the creativity
yeah man i'm telling you what unlock are
you going for right now
um we're trying to unlock
tainted lazarus
yeah you get the applebee's commercial
and then you can make your your weird uh
you know like electro reggae album
with sting or something like that
i i always come back to the
the of montreal outback steakhouse
commercial
let's pretend we don't exist let's go to
outback tonight
come on man
f f
heavy f but we'll take it anyway
i like of montreal i got nothing but
respect for
for the the sellout game either
can somebody explain rat jam um
it's it's the feeling you get when you
are at the marvel vs capcom 2
character selection lobby
is the best emote on twitch next to
funky champ
you know what no i'm not gonna use
emperor
i could i can find it i even slowed down
and everything but then i scratched my
head
what's your least favorite element of a
song
like i'm trying to think like there's
there's things that i hear on the radio
where i just like immediately like tune
out
i don't mean like verse chorus you know
i mean like sure rap break i'll
allow i think that's more what i'm going
for millennial whoop i can understand
i i really any time a song starts to
sound like the planet coaster
uh title screen
i'm like that's caught in the bad
romance but
um that annoys me for sure
but i also like i don't know any band
that
sounds like um the old crow medicine
show
i don't know why it just sends me
into like the stratosphere i just hate
it man
like
wafers really good i like that yeah yeah
take me out of here
there's something about it
like when wagon wheel came out good song
but then it like you know became
so popular and then i i feel like i've
just been hearing like variants of that
song
every day for like the last
for like the last two decades
i've been along with you you belong with
me or my
amazon number something something yeah
hey oh boy
are they different songs i don't know
but it's just it's it's the same it's
pam beasley it's the same song
no thank you
i hate i hate the artists who sing with
a midwestern accent like the
the owl city voice oh you
you're talking about dan's um blink 182
quote
yeah we dropped a trinket uh several
several floors ago
it was strange being that nobody knows
what it does
let's go let's go down man why not car
commercial music oh dude yeah now you're
talking
i i lost damage because we had red stew
which was a temporary
damage bonus and now that damage bonus
is gone
which is fine
thank you thank you oh you're welcome
you're welcome
red stew
we don't need to talk about it because
we're like very far away from
christmas but i gotta tell you i
absolutely i
i despise christmas music as well
and i hate that it always gets um
it always ends up with you having to be
like defend yourself and be like you
know
oh no i don't actually hate like my
family or i don't i don't hate happiness
but if you apparently like for some
people out there like if you don't
love hearing the same four
songs for an entire month every single
year for your entire life
you're like the grinch like hallmark has
done a number on some
some elements of society for sure
the old christmas songs like some of
them like the bing crosby's i can get
down with
maybe once a year but like especially
legitimate modern artists
that then make christmas music that it
makes me irrationally upset
please notice i did say irrational
there's no reason to get this mad over
over something that you could just
mostly ignore but
still
no it's rational i just like i
like i i like bruce springsteen i got a
lot of respect i've been talking about
born to run a lot it's some it's an
amazing album
and he's got some other work that's uh
that's great as well
but then you know what bruce springsteen
song do i hear most on the radio
honestly it's probably dancing in the
dark but then secondarily every december
santa claus is coming down
and you're like bruce come on man really
like
i don't know what happened that led you
to make this but like
come on i didn't take a full card in
[Laughter]
hold on there's stood boss rush no no
no after all that
thanks a lot bruce you screwed me
you've got no respect for the bruce that
serves as the
hold on believe believe
believe i don't know what this would
filigree feather please
so we're screwed huh like there's this
is the the time that i need
some some deliberate um very very
specific advice
yeah you're screwed okay no i'm not
screwed let's do a victory lap
can can you do it on a victory lap
you can't do it on a victory lap okay
well we'll finish the run anyway
i'm i'm not owned i'm not owned
you know it's not about the well i mean
it is about unlocking the tainted
version of the character but
it's about the it's about playing the
game as well it's about the friends we
made along the way
if the r key shows up as i suppose yeah
it's about the banter too
so you you can basically never insult
anything to do with any holiday
without um coming across as the grinch
i get a lot of heat for saying i
freaking hate st patrick's day man
like if you have some connection to
saint patrick's day i got nothing
against you
if your only connection to it though is
like
i like to get drunk in public and then
like throw up on the bus
then i'm like yeah i you know
i just i dislike that day
and then there's always like one comment
that's like i work at a bar in dublin
and i agree with you and i always just i
rely on that comment for strength
it's like the the inversion of the one
guy meme and i'm like yeah that
it might just be one guy but there's one
guy with like a a
he's got a lot of authority behind it
i work at a bar in dublin and i agree
with you c
c
i'm also like i'm a big believer in that
like holiday refreshes
like and we don't need to go down the
same
exact road over again but the next
canadian holiday is victoria day
and i'm like you know no no disrespect
to queen victoria but like
you're old don't care didn't ask plus
you're like you've been dead for like
120 years or something like that
new holiday let's we can keep the day
but let's name it something different
doesn't have to we don't have to
celebrate queen victoria anymore she's
freaking
long dead you know you can celebrate it
for like a generation or something like
that maybe if you're into that sort of
thing
but like why don't we just have like a
different day you know
gretzky day baby frick yeah
wayne gretzky needs a day if you're not
gonna add more holidays
let's rename some of the ones we already
got
yeah what we do we need like a terry fox
day or something like that that's
he's a real hero growing up we hear
about terry fox all the time in canada
but it wasn't until i was an adult
that i realized you know like when
you're a kid you're like okay he ran a
lot
you know and died
you know that's after he got his leg
amputated you know it's
an inspiring story but the gravity of it
doesn't really hit you
then when you get older and you're like
wait a minute that dude wrote he ran
a marathon every single day on one foot
that's crazy that's that's unbelievably
like inspiring
he needs a day man
i petition change.org petition to change
victoria day to
to terry fox day
i'll sign it
he has a day yeah but we don't get the
day off
i mean that's we should get the day off
that's what terry would have wanted
probably
i did i don't know him but he seems like
a good guy i'd like to think that we
we would have gotten the day off oh you
even went in the wrong direction
you're not wrong we did go in the wrong
direction this one's just like a pure
disaster
yeah there you go dude september 9th
wayne gretzky day
99 i get it
i'm british what the heck is victoria
day i don't know man so like
look canada has obviously his roots uh
connected to the united kingdom queen
elizabeth i'm not sure if she was the
queen
when we confederated maybe we gave her a
day as part of the terms and conditions
she's like sure
you know we won't go to war and you can
maintain like some degree of
nominal independence just run some stuff
by me first
and also like give me my own day but
like
i feel like uh i mean it's just like how
long are we gonna reasonably celebrate
victoria day four is it gonna be like
2500 and we'll be like happy victoria
day
seems it seems weird right like
it's time to just modernize some of the
i think there should be a holiday
refresh like minimum
100 years if if the holiday named after
like an event or a person
has been has been around for a hundred
years we should revisit it we don't have
to rename it necessarily but let's at
least run it
you know through like a committee or
something
like i'm just going to be honest what
what the hell is president's day
nobody knows
nobody has ever seen this ending
[Laughter]
anyway slash marker
whoops my bad sorry sorry for this one
my bad anyway let's
let's get tainted lazarus let's do it
this time we're gonna do it man this
time this time we're gonna do it
padding the win streak baby yeah yeah
baby
what about christmas well sometimes i
think christmas is like when it went to
committee christmas is not going to be
renamed
you don't want to be the politician
who's like let's rename christmas you
know
you're going to get trounced in the
midterms
i think you get away with being the the
person
that's like hey let's rename queen
victoria day to like you know
justin trudeau is just i'm just trying
to stoke the fire a little bit
president's day is halfway between
george washington and thomas jefferson's
birthday
that can't be true it's the dumbest
thing i've ever heard
it's a consolidation of a number of
early presidents birthdays
that all happen to be in february is
honestly one of the
it's is i i can't the banter doesn't
exist it's
it's the stupidest thing i've ever heard
like oh beautiful this is what we want
to see um
why is it stupid well because so the day
is not actually a day it's like an
arbitrary midpoint between
two equally arbitrary days
and then secondarily like why is it i
mean i guess they call the president's
day because it's too
too many letters when you gotta pay by
the the character in the printing press
era to be like
uh it's washington lincoln day or
something like that like
you could rename presidents day i'm not
saying remove the holiday but like
you know who who cares about george
washington's birthday dude the man has
been dead for
200 years
you got to make some space for modern
heroes otherwise
you know they're never going to add more
holidays because it'll affect the bottom
line
so you might as well repurpose some of
the existing ones
in response to you know a changing world
you know if you guys want to go to bed
for the christmas one by all means you
you can commit political
uh suicide on that one i'm just saying
i'm i'm going to start with the
non-sacred cows like for example
presidents day i didn't read we had so
many presidents day stands in chat
my great great great grandmother saw
george washington speak
in new york in the late 18th century
and i can't believe
you want to get rid of the day that's
exactly halfway between his birthday and
also the birthday of abraham lincoln
in the original old english
at least give him his own day then
like i would respect it more if it was
like hey this is george washington's
birthday
instead they're like george washington
sorry pretty good president
but we can only afford half a day right
now
if you could maybe partner up with
somebody else like maybe another
founding father and you guys could
collude on a birthday
and share it then maybe but for one
birthday i i don't know
use scissor on the two spirit hearts
okay here we go here we go
here we go
okay now that that's done let's get back
to the run
i'm just saying
we need to either look if you don't want
to rename
the day that's also fine at least add
more then
like people are so hesitant to add more
days
but also they don't want to rename any
other days
do you like any holiday i mean i like
christmas i don't celebrate the
the religious aspect of it but i like
the vibe
i enjoy thanksgiving for kind of like
the same purpose
i mean i i like getting
you know especially when i worked a more
traditional job or when i was in school
when you get like a day off that's a
legit holiday
no matter what dude i'll celebrate
anything if i if i get the day off from
uh
from school
but also i'm like dude the adherence to
tradition i think sometimes
you know it prevents us from celebrating
contemporary occasions that are you know
worthy of
adulation
yeah like dan's big brother win exactly
anyway that's all i got i didn't realize
there's so many people
such a big fan of what uh what
president's day stands for
my bad i do i honestly thought that
would be like one of the
one of the easier ones to go for but
apparently it's
that's not the case
i'm not even anti-george washington but
i mean like he's had 200 years man
should celebrate someone different like
you know what about stephen malkomas
what about like stephen malcmus day
instead
columbus day yeah dude he said 600 years
come on i think
i'm just saying whenever a holiday gets
announced
we should also add a little asterisk to
it that's like will be revisited
150 years from now no offense
if if this is good
no offense right now like you're you're
one of the best
you're getting your own holiday but in
2050
or 2500 we might get rid of this one to
make room because we're gonna have more
heroes by then hopefully
anyway that's all i got
yeah if you uh dude honestly like if i
do something
heroic and i get my own day i think i
would just ask for it to be like baked
in
i'll be like dude in 50 years like
i'm dust you know my my descendants at
that point probably are at the point
where they're just apologizing for my
actions instead of
honoring my legacy you could just cut
that holiday give it to somebody else
man
i'm sure there will be people that'll
come along that'll deserve it instead
did you know chip took multiple
personality quizzes and was
labeled christopher columbus in every
single one
i don't i don't understand
why would a personality test tell you
you're christopher columbus to begin
with that's like uh
why why is christopher columbus
an option for these personality tests
was he was he known
for uh i mean
anything except for being uh a sailor
and not that good at maps
i suppose i don't know
it's just great i feel like usually you
would be like you're like idris elba
christopher columbus it's like you know
700 years ago
600 who were you in a last life
okay who were you in a last life that's
that's different than a personality test
i understand now now we drop trinket we
drop trinket
on the first floor we just don't let me
for go on a bruce springsteen rant and
forget about uh
the fool card this time
uh that's the worst deal in the history
of deals
it's the opposite of stocks like money
is on sale today that's shorts
all right note to self never say the
word christopher columbus
uh on stream ever again uh ruins chat
environments
gonna put that one into the spreadsheet
note to self people still largely fans
of george washington
with some noted exceptions christopher
columbus
still a very very hot button issue
uh that we will not be touching on the
show ever again
terry fox
jury's out on whether terry fox is gonna
have his own day people seem content
with the fact that he has a day even
though we don't get the day off
personally i think what uh terry fox
would have wanted is that we get a day
off to eat some turkey but
um we'll table that and we'll uh
we'll bring that discussion back in
maybe 2026 or something like that
okay i want to live this run it has real
potential
can we now talk about funny fashion back
in the historical record
do people do be looking humorous
in in portraits from back in the day
by the way like especially the yeah the
neck frill i think it's called a buff
or something like that that's like
that and the the the powdered wigs and
stuff like that
i mean what were they what were they
thinking
who made this
just oh yeah rough sorry not a buff
that's what you wear on survivor it's my
mistake
would you want any of those fashions to
come back yeah powdered wigs
for for obvious reasons
it's just weird for sure
i mean you know it's hard to get the
baby ready for a walk
you got to put you got to put you know
sometimes the baby's just in a onesie so
we got to put pants on the baby you put
pants on the baby you're like i might as
well
change the diaper you change the diaper
and you're like oh i've got her in the
stroke get the stroller out unfold the
stroller
uh put her in the stroller oh crap i
forgot to put like baby sunscreen on her
i put the sunscreen on her okay
um then uh we're about to go and i'm
like oh i forgot
the baby's hat so that she doesn't get
the sun in her eyes you get a baby's uh
hat like it takes like 10 minutes to get
ready
um
just to just to leave for like a five
minute walk i can't imagine like that
that must be what it was like to just be
alive in like the 17th century right
like
i mean if you were part of the
aristocratic class at least
like oh hold on i got to put on my
powdered wig oh hold on i got
17 buckles on my tunic that i have to
wouldn't want to go outside because
people would only see you know the world
was very small
before the internet existed
like you people would share stories like
the same story over and over again i
know that's kind of what i do as well
but you would have like legendary
stories um
in your in your family they'll be like
yeah remember the time that
you know uncle bill was at uh
you know the uh he came to thanksgiving
and he had his underwear on outside of
his pants
like that would live in your head
forever like people would pass it down
like it's
uh like an oral tradition right
nowadays because of the internet you
know you see that moment
from everybody's life but you see like
10 of them a day
so i can't even imagine what it was like
in the 16th century if you left
you know you won't believe it copernicus
i saw him at the agora earlier today and
he didn't even have his frill buckled i
mean of course he had the normal buckle
but he didn't have the
the secondary buckle he's never gonna
leave that one down
i'll take it why not
anyway long story short i'm you know
judgment i'm i'm relatively pleased with
the era i was born in i think for for
fashion purposes
i think especially right now comfort
seems to be uh
one of the most common things one
considers when dressing
i like it
long story short i don't like powdered
wigs exactly man
i guess back in the day like you didn't
have anything to do
for leisure time right so maybe like if
you were like oh getting what's my hobby
getting dressed
there was no crunchyroll back then you
know
always wonder like so i mean like we
went off on it kind of on
well went off is not the right word i
talked about it on twitter because
people were like
well i said just the shower thought
our slash shower thoughts i was like
were people stoked when they invented
deodorant they had to be like
you know finally right and then there
were some people that
and i don't want to cause any problems
here
but there were some people that were
like no back in the
day they didn't know that bo was a
problem they just took it as like a
like a normal thing and like body odor
was something that like basically has
been invented by the proctor and gamble
corporation just to
you know mill your pocketbook and i was
like i don't know man because
i do be stinky
i i got even some like patronizing
replies to that tweet to be honest with
you that
that also uh i i wanted to reply to in
my head
and had a great time doing so but did
not reply to out loud
like somebody was like i actually
stopped using deodorant because it gives
me a rash
fair play they said if you don't want to
have bo just shower daily and i was like
oh man i hadn't thought of that
uh radical piece of intel
i had previously i've just been you know
bathing once a month and wondering why
my armpits smell like the
organic section at the grocery store um
i hadn't thought like they they hit me
with the forehead just bathed daily and
i was like i
i already do i'm still stinky you know
it's uh
i i didn't realize it was so
controversial but then i read
someone linked like a history of uh the
deodorant industry
and it was kind of interesting
it was like originally uh i mean like
they used to use perfume way back in the
day to masks
to mask nasty odors obviously um
but then uh the first deodorants were
invented in like the early 20th century
or something like that but
nobody wanted to use them like they
didn't they didn't think it was actually
a problem they were skeptical
also apparently it had to be suspended
in acid
in order to actively work but uh
but eventually it worked i get so the
the story of it is that uh
the a doctor invented it and then his
daughter started a company
to sell it and she displayed it at the
world's
fair but was like having no success and
then there was like a legendary heat
wave
it's like an it's what this the story of
kismet
and then people started being like i'll
take uh you know seven barrels
and the the rest is history as they say
and now you know
the rest of the story it's kind of
interesting that
you think about like there's like
obvious reasons that it would kind of
like suck to live in the past
one you don't think about now and then
is i bet like if you brought your modern
nose back to the past you would be like
bro is stinky as hell
everybody stinks
another thing that i would think of is
like dude how did you
wake up for
uh like your job when there were no
clocks not just
alarm clocks but like how did you ever
plan to like
meet people you know what i mean like if
you had to go to an appointment at some
point did you just
you're like hey you didn't make times
for it you just went like hey
show up at my office at some point in
the future
and we'll make the time i don't underst
because now it's like you know
hey you know we got appointments booked
you know 9 00 a.m to 5 00 p.m
what did you do if you were like uh you
know if you were
an accountant in the year 1600
i've got i've i'm fully booked tomorrow
i've got an appointment for sun up
high noon and sundown i just can't fit
i i can't fit you in
i don't know man just it's
just a confusing nice of confusing time
i know there was a like a job that would
go around
and knock on your window when it was
like time to wake up
i'm getting it man i don't care i'm off
the rails here that's one okay
good to remember sun dials okay
fair enough i didn't really think about
sundials there you go how did the wake
up guy wake up there you go
was maybe he was just like a night
streamer maybe he stayed up all night so
that he'd be able to
wake up the people in the morning
yeah do sundials work at night or do you
need a moon dial
back when i was a kid the only thing in
burger king that didn't have any meat in
it was the hot dog
anyway yeah i'm skipping the dishes i'm
taking the garbage out twice as much but
i'm skipping the dishes
i'm buying the key anyway
that's all i got
what'd you do if it's cloudy yeah i
guess like if it was cloudy you just
didn't uh
i mean you just took the day off i
suppose
wow dude i had no idea that this existed
there were candles with nails in them
and when the candle melted past a
certain point
the nail would fall and make a noise and
you would wake up
that's interesting we should
not be using uh anything but our tears i
should not have bought
blue baby's only friend but you know
life goes on
we could use the stars card instead why
not
can of corn what if you're a heavy
sleeper yeah i guess you just like
you know remain uh
remain awake or like i don't know don't
cancel my morning appointments or
something
it's just it's i mean it's weird to
think about right the modern
conveniences we have that we take for
granted
like so people bathed in the olden days
let's say like in
in the medieval era right people bathed
but like
how did they bathe you wouldn't have
like a bathtub in your house
were there like communal bathtubs in the
village
were they were they hot were they
lukewarm
all but like going to i guess you don't
care that much if you're um
you know if it's in the medieval era you
just take it as like you know
this is what life's like right there but
like
it's not really that clean i suppose to
go into a bath that a hundred people
have already bathed themselves in
you know what i mean
i guess they they had bigger problems
but still
we don't need the full card we have the
stars card if you're gonna be mad at
least like know what you're being mad
about that's all i ask i would never ask
you to
you know buffer your acetylcholine
that's that's part of the vibe that
we've got here and i embrace it
sometimes begrudgingly and sometimes
wholeheartedly but in this case
we're totally fine
i don't know it's here's the thing i
think it's like it's really hard to
imagine regressing in that sense right
like going from modern standards to to
the past
it seems like it's like terrible
but i guess if you if if it was
contemporary you were probably like
you know yeah i stink a little bit but
not as much as i did yesterday you know
one run it's weird to think about
that's why like if i was going back in
the past in a time machine
honestly i don't think i'd go back past
like 2010.
i think at this point if if you were
like you know hey we're gonna send you
back to like 1995.
i'd be like uh the music on the radio is
a little bit better but
man no smartphone i don't know maybe
just kill me
i'd have to think about it for sure
no google maps by yes
how did you get anywhere back in the day
man i'm
like i'm just thinking about it i'm like
okay
let's say you live in oh yeah we don't
want to go in here by the way thank you
good thing we paused
good thing we paused um if you'll excuse
me we're going in here
um you live in a big city okay
this you live in new york city toronto
et cetera et cetera et cetera
how the heck did you go to a business
you'd never been to before
you have to look it up in a map or
and then remember it or do you just is
this so like sometimes
i i think people my generation
and older look at directions differently
like sometimes somebody over the age of
like 50
will be like was it on the north side or
the south south side
and i'm like what the hell are you
talking about i don't know
i've never pictured it that way in my
brain like from a top down
direction and like whether it's oriented
towards the sun
rise or away from the sunrise like i
just it's there
i know the street
okay we might need to focus a little bit
i'm enjoying not having to have line of
sight
like sometimes someone will say like oh
yeah i was on like the east side of the
street
and i'm like how do you know like how do
you know that
and it's simple they were born in 1969
or earlier
you can just look at the sun i don't
need the sun i have my phone
there's there's a good bit millennial
christopher columbus
maybe that's actually okay table that
bit we'll run that bit back later
people are not ready for millennial
christopher columbus bit yet
oh you guys are ready for that one but
your kids are gonna hate it
there you go so we can we can make
something happen there
ever meme template every comedian in
1999
you guys are ready for that one but your
kids are gonna hate it
it totally works get me out of here son
of a brain
whatever i've decided not to die
i've decided we're probably going to die
what are you gonna do kill me
i wonder if you brought a phone oh no
okay that was kind of sick um
hold on i don't know how long we've been
doing this run i'm not sure that
how long did we die on that that's
probably a slash marker that was a great
run though
laz run okay i've decided lazarus like
sucks



and let's do some better characters like
tinted jacob no nl don't do it okay fine
tinted um let's oh lamington i forgot
about tinted bethany
i forgot what lemmington does but
it gives you an item every time you use
it
but only for the floor is that correct
la megatron it's a good name
anyway the the phone bit was i wonder if
google maps would still work if you
brought back
a smartphone i mean it would work i
guess
like if it had stored data like
sometimes you know you've got like a sat
nav
in your car and uh you know you'll be in
like an underground
parking garage and it'll have like some
stored data on it
but you won't be able to plan like a new
route until you get network access
but it's more like i guess what what the
what would the purpose of um
of the map be you'd be like oh there's a
great like uh
boba tea place right around here oh wait
no there's not because it's 1500.
turn right at ye old major thoroughfare
yeah i don't know man it would be uh i
don't want to go
i don't want to i mean okay i really
don't want to go forward in time
like i think that that's much worse like
from an operational standpoint than
going back in time
but i definitely also don't want to go
back in time more than
10 years more than 15 years
i take a there's a lot of modern
conveniences
why not forward i don't know forwards
just scary right
because like you're i feel like if
you're going forward you're
you're trying to satisfy this idea of uh
you know curiosity of like i wonder what
the world is going to look like in
100 years or whatever but like
it just seems like even going forward in
time like
two years would be scary right like can
you imagine if in 2018 you got in a time
machine and popped out in like
you know april 2020 and we're like
what the hell's going on you're in like
you know downtown
new york city and nobody's nobody's out
and everybody's
that is out is wearing masks and stuff
like that you'd be like what the hell
happened here
like i guess if you believe in the idea
that
um you know the the story of humanity is
like a perpetual
rising graph of like quality of life
then i i welcome you to use your time to
travel powers to go forward in the
future
for me i'd rather i i kind of feel like
the devil i know is better than the
devil i don't
i feel like i'm i'm happy as where i
stand
hold on we want to go boss rush light
side path i can do that
boss rush light side can of corn i can
do that
i think i i'd go back i mean going back
in time is like
i mean it's just a i don't want to say
it's a better option like universally
because i mean like definitely like
going forward in time is what you do if
you cryogenically freeze yourself right
you know if you've got something that
you needed
medical science to advance to the point
where it could like help you out or
something like that then then i
understand completely
um but
going back in time if you get the
dilemma is undefeated
it's like a superpower like you you
basically become
uh very rich if you want to
and you also uh probably if you wanted
to you could be like a celebrity
because they'd be like what the heck
this guy he's really good at predictions
you know
plus you get to like do cool stuff again
like dude can you imagine the street
cred you would have gotten if you went
to r slash marvel studios and posted the
exact
line by line plot synopsis of avengers
infinity war
people would be like what
this guy's so good
yeah take me back to when people were
using bitcoins to buy pizzas
and then i'm gonna get into the pizza
business
we're not selling we're not selling
bitcoins we're selling the picks and
shovels
pimolacria
not a not a great move on my part
anyway i don't know i i
i've never been convinced that the
future would be better for time travel
than the past
feel like you know with the future
you're only getting one thing
you're getting this to see a point in
history that you might
or a point in human existence you might
otherwise never be able to see
doesn't interest me all that much
i think i'd rather just live like in you
know the modern times but
with severe advantages
cause like you know okay here's this is
gonna blow your mind
traveling to the past means
that you already live in the mf and
future
if you travel back to 1990
you've already been to the future man in
2020
i'm buying this if you remember were you
fearful for the future
25 years ago um i was eight
no sorry i was seven
i uh
i've got some memories from when i was
seven not
so much related to existential dread um
more related i beat mega man x that year
i think
uh
at least i i you know i have strong
memories
of really struggling on launch octopus
in particular
and even to this day if i play mega man
x when i when i come against launch
octopus like i'm
i'm i dread it i'm like oh man but then
he's like not that bad you just have to
use the roll
shield right if you just use the roll
shield you're good
lemmington please oh okay i remember now
so it gives you the item
but when the wisp gets extinguished you
lose the item
okay okay i remember
so there are some wisps we absolutely do
not want to lose
stop saying it like that dude it's
lamington is a much better name than let
me get on
rolls off the tongue
i have lost a copious amount of damage
oops
alexander lamington we are waiting in
the game for you
if you pick up the hearts you'll get the
i
i don't so
edmund
okay sorry sorry
anyway that's i'm exhausted on bits
today i'm i'm out of bits i'm bitless
kissing the bitless dissing the bitless
by the shins the shins baby remember the
shins baby
oh caring is creepy um maybe if you care
about the music the shins make
it's caring is cringy
um anyway the shins baby stop this no
i don't have
anybody else listening to the shins or
just me
oh inverted world is a sick album it's
pretty good
i like i liked it a lot when i was in
high school i like it
decently now i honestly i still think
caring is creepy is a better album
though
i think it shoots too sorry shoots too
narrow i think shoots too narrow is a
better album
different different strokes for
different folks though
this is not charging lemmington i need
you to charge lamington please
this is not charging lamington um
i wish i understood any of this man's
musical references
if you ever got time machine take
yourself back to about the year 2002
you're going to go to a website
pitchforkmedia.com
and then you too can have indie rock
credit in the early 2000s
if you'll excuse me i need to get these
for lemmington
does it okay so people told me when the
first item's charged it charges the
second but wait a minute now my second
item's charged as well
yeah i don't know if that was the right
move anyway
um this is it's looking increasingly
unlikely we're gonna get to boss rush
like this
i think so
oh thank you i appreciate you've been
watching on youtube for a long time this
is the first time on twitch
slightly different vibe here but you
know more conversational if you like the
if you like the the back and forth
banter twitches
is the your main marty if you like the
solo driven banter you know i understand
the appeal of youtube says true boss
rush will charge lemmington
could be quite powerful tractor beam is
a great start as well
which chip has the best shape we don't
need it but that's still
interesting we do no we don't need it
okay
um
chip has the best shape it's a great
question i'm trying
dude i really like the the shape of sun
chips
like the the wave shape creates
multiple different uh
loci points what's the word i'm looking
for
there's turbidity creates multiple
points
that um where there is a
disproportionate amount
of uh of seasoning powder which is
delicious
i i very much enjoy a sun chip
for sure
that that's a bummer in general chips
with folds i think
gonna get a great texture and a great
amount of seasoning powder as well
take the heart oh yeah good point
[Laughter]
flavor nodes exactly exactly
nucleation that's the word i was trying
i was trying to think of the word
but also i was trying to think of how to
explain what word i was looking for
and i was not coming to any conclusion
about how i was gonna
explain nucleation i was you know the
word when things
collide and divide from one another due
to their structure
thank you for saying nucleation you
you've saved my life here
we don't need uh you know what
while we're here for the first time
ever now chad loses their superiority
i've finally found the first ultra
secret room of my life
i never would have expected i'm too dumb
for potato chip talk
well it's just i i think i just phrased
it in a um
in a silly way you know
pardon me i think um
the the more folds something has and the
more creases and the more crinkles
the more uneven the flavor distribution
will be
and uneven distribution is actually good
because it creates pockets of
unbelievable flavor
that's that's all i gotta say boss rush
boss rush light side boss rush light
side
does that mean you would eat fried
intestine i have
um like i've eaten makjang which i
believe is
pig intestine in korea i don't like the
flavor
is what it comes that like did it it has
a lot of flavor
for sure um which i think it proves the
point
however the flavor is not appealing to
me
got me thinking about chips now though
pirates booty also great man i know i
already said it'd be smacking but
the thing that the other thing i didn't
even mention about eating yiddin chepsy
little batch
how many bitcoins did you pay for that
the sun chips you love
anyway um so
they do something with the pirates booty
man i don't know how they do it
but um well
i'm dumb uh the first
lil bite is
like it's smooth crunchy
you know like you can tell it's crunchy
but it's also a little soft
even though those are two flavors that
are diametrically opposed
but then the the finish bite i don't
know if it's got like extra
rice in the towards the end or something
like that but it's like
crispy crunchy and you're like man
it's yeah yeah there you it's like an
oily crunch versus a dry rub
gets the people going gets me going
pop i ball tears you can make it you can
make it
what are you you're just kidding me
being right what an embarrassment
anyway whenever i hear crispy i think of
the krispy kreme meme
oh you mean back at it again at the
krispy kreme
okay let this gives me free lemington's
from time to time
i'm starting to recall i'm starting to
remember
actually it does nothing no no
no no it's free lamingtons it's free
lamingtons
favorite donut there is there's a hot
debate in vancouver
there are three eminent donut chains
all of which are um
are good actually all of which are great
there is a place called kartems they
predominantly sell
cake type donuts with with a certain
hipster bend to them
like you you can get just you know like
an old-fashioned donut you can get a
glazed jelly doughnut but you can also
get
uh you know some kind of like more weird
stuff you know like a like a parmesan
donut and stuff like that
and you might think that it's just made
to be like hipster
they're really good they do not just
taste like you're eating cheese
the cheese adds like a nice little you
know certain saltedness and a little
a little aroma as well but it's still
delicious
there's another place called lucky's
they also do cake style donuts
and there's a big debate between those
two about about whose donut is better
and then there's a third place i don't
want it um
there is a third place
that's called lee's donuts which is
located in the the tourist hot spot of
vancouver island boss rush
boss rush yeah yeah yeah boss rush pick
up the hearts
also good but lee's donuts is more of a
those are more like the tim horton style
like bready doughnuts
i'm a cake doughnut man personally
don't need it we don't need it we simply
do not need it
i guess we could use it to get boss rush
and then do one extra floor
um yeah okay i'm gonna i'm gonna go back
and get it actually
scifly don't don't break i need you for
boss rush please
croissant style donut dude i've never
sorry when i said vancouver island i'm
at granville island yeah yeah
these donuts located on uh granville
island much different than vancouver
island
both are islands
that's the and they're both in british
columbia and i've been to them both but
that's the only similarity
what is a cake doughnut it's like you
know i'm
it's like donut but the flour or
like the texture of the the donut itself
is more cake-like than i don't know what
the alternative is but you know like
sometimes you have a doughnut
and when you bite into it it's like
there's a top and a bottom but no middle
like as soon as you bite into it it just
flattens the the doughnut
a cake donut is not like that it's it's
it's soft and squishy
it's the difference between cake and
bread yeah
you don't overthink it please take the
hearts
oh my bad did i miss some that's
probably the first time
cake doughnut tastes like uh it tastes
like uh
it's got the texture of cake i just i'm
struggling to remember what you would
describe the other donut as
normal donut
i got nothing against the normal donut
but the cake doughnut it's just
doobie tastier
you want a herd stoner heard stone it
oh i didn't know so one the other like
the default donut shape
or well circle but the default donut
is made via a rising action of yeast
whereas the cake is simply a batter you
know i it makes perfect sense
that's why i don't work in the in the
doughnut sciences i'm merely an
enthusiast
okay we will take the light side path
we will take shook the wood
this is very solid we still have sci fly
this is very solid
that was not very smart though
i i i desire maximum levington's please
you can't you can't hit me i have scifly
scifly did not activate there
i'm perturbed
oh no it totally works yeah dude we we
need maximum lamington like this is
this is pretty jank right here we also
just lost the wisp that cost us probably
stapler
i believe i lost my stapler office space
classic movie
uh double scifly don't get me wrong
pretty cool we lose one sci-fly we got
another
however i also want some damage but that
if we manage to keep one or both after
this we're going to be thrilled
i mean i guess the other thing with
sci-fly is it makes it a lot harder to
lose a wisp unless we run into an enemy
so i'm not complaining but it is gonna
it's not gonna speed us up
call a sci-fly but not for me well
see you don't wanna lose those wisps
you don't you don't want to lose those
wisps
oh yeah the red hearts
my bad my bad that sort of thing is my
bad baby
this is gonna be a long one
hold on away
can of corn anything going on in your
life
in need of a banter catalyst i guess so
it's just so we're gonna be here for a
bit
i became a homeowner this week that's
pretty sick
welcome welcome to the the homeowners
association
happy for you
you're keeping me occupied thank you
pretty much this is my job description
i don't know you know if i wanted
to have nobler aims for my content
i would you know maybe script or edit or
something i'd release ten minute and
five second long
uh videos on youtube that had like a
a reason to exist instead i i make
you know i make idle content for for
idle time
and i embrace that
the most recent vod on
the most recent vod on youtube is
hilarious what's the most recent vod on
youtube
national anthem tier list when oh no
i'm more of a flag guy like
national anthem i'm trying to
i'm trying to think the russian national
anthem is incredible
like it is definitely at near the top
it's in the top tier
for sure i'm not that impressed
like you know you might think that
there's kind of like a home bias
i i don't really have you know i mean i
have nothing against the canadian
national anthem but also like
you know i don't find it particularly
inspiring or anything like that
oh i will say though if you hear it
enough in school
you you know it's going to be a good day
when they bust out the this is for my
canadian
students only so i apologize
you know what i'm talking about when i i
forget the name of the
the band but they they're like a famous
canadian
acapella group that i guess also made a
national anthem that
that became popular in canadian uh
middle schools and high schools
and then there there were like five of
them and they'd in the background they'd
be going like
up up up up up
and at the end it's like oh canada
we stand on guard for
the bum
and i can't hit the last notes but you
know then at the very end they go
canada it's a it's a classic bop
didn't even give me the bombs huh
anyway um the nylons that's
uh you're gonna laugh in my head i was
thinking it's the vinyls
but i knew it wasn't them because the
vinyls uh
are the band that sing uh when i think
about you i touch myself
from austin powers one but i knew there
it was
some kind of fabric
could be here for a bit huh you know
what jump on me
mission failed mission succeeded
also pick up those red hearts shave
those sideburns
mattingly
don't don't break my wisps
red hard damage i'm begging you gemini
it's it's kind of something
is being a canadian a canadian an asset
on twitch um you know originally i was
gonna say like it doesn't matter
um but i think it kind of i wouldn't say
it's an asset
but you get the ability to come out on
top no matter
who's getting dissed you know the two
most frequently dissed
uh countries on english-speaking twitch
definitely england and the united states
of america
so as a canadian you're very well
positioned
because when people diss america you go
like yeah i know right
haha you know you know exactly how to
hurt them
and then when americans are disin
england you're like yeah i know
what are they they're naming things all
sorts of funny names why are you calling
it a lorry dude it's just a truck
you think you're better than me just
because you got a cool accent
so i think being a canadian is well
positioned to that extent yeah
that's about it though what about when
they diss the queen
most people in canada don't really care
for the monarchy unless you're like
you know like quite literally like over
the age
of 90.
what did we lose oh my god we lost
damage again
what about when people diss your flag i
mean i don't know you can diss the
canadian flag if you want you know
there's no
there's no accounting for taste canadian
flag is pretty sweet though
it's unique and it's striking
yeah it's a leaf so what
all i'm saying is if you're making fun
of the canadian flag and you're from
one of the 75 countries whose flag is
just like
three stripes like know your place
we tried something a little different
nobody ever forgets which one the
canadian flag is
please let me out of here oh daddy
longlegs is pretty sick
yeah that's the other like i'm i'm
actually a little jealous if you're from
one of the like tri-colored
flag countries because you get like it
must have been so easy to draw it
trying to draw the canadian flag in
elementary school oh my god man
it's it's hard to draw a maple leaf and
you're always like how many points are
on it and then how many points does each
point have and like
it's annoying it's not like the british
flag like i think you just
you want to you want to make the the
english flag
all you need is like a red pencil crayon
and a ruler
let me out of this boss rush dude i'm
dying in here
well if you live in maryland and just
like you know
best of luck to you
dude please please
please the soul of bethany has appeared
in the basement thank god thank god
um leprosy classic classic good item all
right and now we're going we're going
down the light side path light side path
baby
lamington baby squeezy baby no spirit
hearts but still
left the red heart behind definitely
definitely believe that
i'm not i'm not that impressed with the
canadian national anthem you know
it's not uh i would not say is
is bad i would not say it's good i would
just say uh
like when i hear it my heart swells a
little bit but
that's about it it's it's fine at best
i don't go like this is i like i would
never listen to it
just like you got to be some kind of
certified certified
nut if you listen if you're canadian and
you listen listen to the canadian
national anthem
for pleasure you're a certified freak
man
if i went over if someone was in the
passenger seat in my car
and they were like yo pass me the ox
cord and then they put on oh canada
i would drop them off at the hospital
that's that's a cry for help
it's on site
does canada have a pledge of allegiance
not really
um no the answer is is simply no
by not really i mean hell no
pledge of allegiance i mean it probably
weirds you out if you're american too
but
it's kind of it's like a little strange
right like
like every day before school you gotta
you gotta promise like uphold the values
of the united states or something like
it's very weird
like if you saw that in a movie it would
be the bad guys who are doing it
even just listening to the national
anthem every day is weird like we i
don't know if every school did it
but like in canada um at least at my
school
you definitely had to listen to the
national anthem every day before class
and stand up for it and you're like
why
i know i guess you're like saying i
don't i don't want to be controversial i
guess i'm just like dude i've heard this
song
literally like like 10 000 times
you think it like for high school what
if they just gave you like eight extra
minutes of i guess it's not that long
but
they give you a few extra minutes of
learning every day instead or something
i hate kidney stones
i don't even remember the us national
anthem that it happened to me in college
too
like i you know in middle school
elementary school high school you hear
um oh canada constantly then you go to
college you might never hear it you go
to a sporting event and you're like i
don't even think i remember the words
plus adding to the confusion often times
in canada they play the anthem
uh half in english and half in french uh
so i i'm like i don't know how the
anthem starts
in french and i don't know how it ends
in english
yeah for real i don't know i think
that's kind of cool though
i would rather they do half an english
half in french than what they do on like
the airplane
where they they do the announcements in
english and then in french can you
imagine
okay light path light path
torn photo now we're talking
imagine that zack
rip empty vessel don't think so wait no
did it
no no it's still going
yeah i mean look at that we got the
invincibility but we can't run into
enemies don't run into enemies
the canadian flag is also like really
recent i mean much like
our country i suppose i feel like a lot
of people
don't know i mean a lot of canadians i
wouldn't expect anybody from outside the
country to know
the country is only like or the the flag
is only like 50 years old
they did a contest in the 1960s and
we're like you know
hey make us a flag and then
i guess someone was like check it out
man
two stripes with a little leaf in the
middle
lester b pearson was like this is the
best i've ever seen man
this perfectly embodies the spirit of
this nation
print it out immediately and sew it onto
every backpack
in all ten provinces and three
territories too
sweet
yeah there was like because i think um
maybe it was like 1997 or 1998
there was like the 30th anniversary of
the
of the flag and there was like a guy was
in elementary school at the time so
i'm sure they were just like you know
here's an easy lesson
so they had us read a book about the
flag and
then you know draw it 70 times and
it's pretty recent i don't know about oh
canada like uh
i'm pretty sure god save the queen was
was the anthem until
sometime in the 20th century
yeah yeah bro we got we got uh
we got 10 provinces up here ten
provinces three territories
you thought there were only four um you
you're thinking of
uh british north america
quit living in the 17th century my man
what do you would you work for the
hudson's bay corporation come on
sorry we got to use lamington
great move okay
what's the difference between provinces
and territories bro i got no idea
to be honest with you i've lived here
for my entire life minus one year i have
absolutely no clue
i'm sure there's a difference i'm sure
the difference is is probably meaningful
in a way that doesn't impact you know my
life but but impacts like you know
the bureaucracy and legislation or
whatever but i
it beats me man i got no clue
yeah we went light side look at this
light side path
do canadians care at all about the
monarchy
um
older in in my limited experience
older canadians might
i don't know anybody i have never met
anybody
i should say under the age of like 60
probably honestly a lot older that was
like
that cares at all but definitely it's
it's a little wild like when i used to
go to uh hockey games in in my hometown
with my grandpa
like the hockey rink has like a it had a
huge
portrait like probably like a 10 foot
high portrait of queen elizabeth the
second
they would always like shine a spotlight
on it during the
national anthem and stuff seems super
weird
uh in hindsight but
well like the um the prince phillips
funeral was on like our
our public broadcasting station here as
well so there's like um
there's there's definitely some
i mean connection but particularly
amongst the older uh the older
canadians
younger canadians i don't think uh care
basically at all
he said it he said amongst us
only old people watch cbc anyway dude i
mean i wanna like the cbc but like every
time i'm i'm on baby duty and then i
like
open the the tv um it's not the tv guide
like the magazine but you know what i
mean like the
electronic guide the cbc is always
playing
coronation street man i don't want to
watch coronation street
i'm 32 years old
is great too like i i grew up thinking
that um because my grandma watched
coronation street
i grew up thinking it was like the
height of british tv and then i brought
it up on stream one time
and people were like coronation street
is like pure
trash is like only watched in the uk by
like people
who like have no taste hello chibli
that wasn't meant to be like people who
have no taste hello ghibli that was
meant to
it was just uh
an inconvenient moment of timing i
apologize
oh yeah eastenders as well eastenders is
popular
uh amongst the the older audience here
ouija board baby frick yeah
okay
hello chip
hello oh that uses our lemmington charge
ryan should i play isaac i've never
played um
it's a question that honestly like i've
thought about
i don't know like i like isaac
a lot but i do sort of feel like i
i responded to um
lawrence you know x inside gaming
lawrence on um
on twitter he was like should i get into
isaac and i was like man honestly like i
don't know
um it's like harder to get
into than like one piece i think at this
point
there's so many different mechanics
stacked up on top
of so many different mechanics like i
think it's fun to play
especially if you have the tolerance for
the when you're streaming it for the
unbelievable amount of backseating
you're gonna receive like if you
consider that a positive then i would
say
why not why not give it a try chip on
the other hand i'm also like chip your
streaming time is so valuable don't
waste it on isaac dude
surely you can find like another uh like
internet portal that's still running
java applets or something like that and
and engage in
you know like online bowling or
you know okay maybe you can find like a
japanese site where they bet on those
like virtual horde races
port races virtual horse races and stuff
like that
that could be cool he jim said he did
find a virtual
horse racing website yeah dude i i could
totally picture you like surrounded by
a bunch of salarymen yelling at like one
of those weird
plastic horses as it goes around the
the track i'd watch that
absolutely
i'm not going to get hit here i promise
you that
uh actually it's called umemosume pretty
derby
dude we're gonna win look at this
i went to an actual horse race at
hastings racecourse and it was pretty
sick
honestly that's pretty cool like i've
never been to a horse race
i would go once for
just for fun you know just just to
experience it that was a good run though
donkey donkey thank you we we went to
the streamer room as well slash marker
tainted bethany light side
path okay had to remember



slash marker bruce
springsteen
dude i don't know we got an hour and a
half left in the stream
do you run it back with twitter
no no you can't you can't dude
i love i love tainted for god let's do
some tainted forgotten
i love tainted forgotten man
god i hate isaac
sorry to hear that um
keep keep it up proud of you
it's not like um
i i think here's what i would say okay i
i got stun locked for a moment and then
i came up with a punch line
left arm people who
hate isaac right arm people who love
isaac caption
hating watching nl play isaac because he
never talks about the game
at all something like that you know it
could work
took me a second to figure something out
but we kind of came up with it
occasionally people come in and they're
like i'm enjoying the stream but i wish
you would tone down the
banter like 20 literally like
i i can't disagree but i also don't know
how like it's not like a dial it's just
like you know
it's just some some runs you've i don't
know i just like i can't
i don't feel good about myself
full stop no i'm trying the i'm trying
to think of the way that i would
describe it okay
it's something like doing this job
is absurd but as long as you don't
actively every moment acknowledge that
you're doing the job
if you can you know enter into some kind
of delusion that you're
an entertainer or you're this is like
weird alt comedy or something like that
then
then you don't think about it the second
i find myself doing commentary like
like i did during the rain game um where
you're like and then i'm gonna go over
here and do this it all
comes crashing down on me and i'm like
what the hell am i doing i'm just saying
what's happening on the screen
and it's uh like did did what what am i
doing
with my life this is they can obviously
see that i'm going over here
because it's on the screen so why are
you saying it and i'm like because i
don't have anything else to say right
now
and i lose confidence in myself
so the the banter is
is not a uh it's not like a boolean on
off sort of thing
seen any cool poops in the street lately
great question thank you
no um i'm actually i'm
the outside uh
era is is temporarily on hiatus because
if you
you can just do it for yourself this is
a bit that has some at-home
participation
if you type vancouver weather into you
know a search engine right now
you will see that we are expected to
have rain
for uh the next 10 days so
it's gonna it's gonna take a little bit
now it doesn't
when it's raining it's not like it rains
a hundred percent of the time but it's
gonna
you know it's gonna minimize the outdoor
uh
the outdoor exposure for sure okay
very simple boss rush
dark boss rush light path boss rush
light path
yeah yeah yeah which dad
archetype are you at the barbecue um
hmm i so i'm not even gonna ask you what
the dad archetypes are
i'm gonna prognosticate um
i don't know why i went alt path by the
way but uh i'm gonna prognosticate on
what the
the dad uh archetypes are
one would be uh dad
who
tries to take control of the grill or
gets very pushy about the barbecue
and it's like hey are you gonna flip
those hey you should flip those
can you flip that one like that's that's
definitely that's the grill master dad
even if he's not in charge of the grill
he's like this is my domain
um
i feel like there's like don't worry
about it dad
that is like even if a kid like you know
cracks a tooth open or something like
that they're just like nah we'll deal
they'll deal with it later don't worry
they're kids don't worry about it
hey the kids are playing with the
fireworks in the shed again ah don't
worry about it you know they're kids
it's what they do chill dad
there's daycare dad i i hate to say it
but i i
i have been daycare dad when i go to
like my uh
my in-laws place which only happened
before i was a dad but
that's where like i would go
it's the dad who's not a dad yet i guess
is a good way to describe it
so like when i would go to uh my in-laws
place
they clearly like i don't want to say
they were sick of their kids right
because that's not what i mean but
they were like finally there's another
adult here um
how about like you play with the kids so
we can have the only break
you know we've had in months i've i've
been that daycare dad
at my in-laws place for sure um but i
don't know
at the barbecue what kind of dad am i
i don't know don't have an answer
uh dad who um
offends the host by bringing his own
beer and then when the host says you
know we had beer
um just going yeah
but it's yeah the the craft beer dead
maybe i'm the craft beer dad
i'm gonna die in here
i'm i'm literally doing nothing like i'm
not even throwing
i'm not even throwing the skull like i
didn't do anything
hey okay try again air fryer dad oh baby
every barbecue i've ever been to has
been byob
dude i don't think i've been to like i
haven't been to too many
uh barbecues as an adult
we we had some in college for sure
um but like social barbecues
honestly the thing is i live uh far away
from my family
uh and i live in a city where
if you have like a deck that can support
more than five people
you're a literal multi-millionaire so i
i don't think
i'm in barbecue country i'm not i'm not
in the barbecue stage of my life right
now
my bitcoins what's the abv on that bear
why'd you bring your own bearer we have
bedlat with lamb you don't like
matz clamata
does not work at all
that being said you don't like mertz
club murder
that works how many back coins do you
own
that's two different people having a
conversation right now
do you own any altcoins
oh my god is that mert's club murder
this is
minus minus two me minus two me i'll
take it minus two
thank you minus one i'll take it i'll
take it
origin a bit please um
viral tweet where uh
someone said whenever their computer
fans start making a lot of noise
they look at their computer and say are
you minding bitcoins a little
then applied valley girl voice
and now i don't even know it's just
added on it's
it's uh you know it's like dropping a
piece of chewing gum on the floor like
it's got so much
unique character now the flavor is tough
to describe
or stomach for that matter
noise
don't hit me i'm leaving
it raised your damage by 2.5 that's
crazy to think about because if you were
here like a couple
uh a couple hours ago we were doing a
blue baby run
uh well we were doing a tainted zazel
run that made it to mega satan and then
we re
uh spawned as blue baby thanks to the
ankh we had 2.74 damage on the mega
satan fight
so the fact that basically our entire
damage was
covered by one item as long as that item
is small rock
we did have a good rate of fire don't
get me wrong
i knew that was coming not a second one
though not a second one
pop play room jesse what the hell are
you talking about
i still don't even know what the pod
play is man
don't tell me
stapler i believe i have my stapler
okay we're doing boss rush boss rush
boss rush and we're skipping
we're skipping so that we can see angel
rooms for certain
yeah yeah it's an incredible room
he's done it dude we finally mastered
isaac
stop asking me what i'm gonna do hot tub
streams the answer is never
due to my copious amounts of body hair
and current incarnation of the dad bod
um i couldn't weather the slings and
arrows of chat
if i took my shirt off on camera just
get over it okay
at some point i'm gonna bite the bullet
i'm gonna buy a peloton
i'm gonna get frickin jacked it's gonna
be incredible
i'm gonna turn into lance armstrong
i've already got the testicular
configuration to make it work
then i'm gonna get laser hair removal on
my entire body
except on my head instead of a laser i'm
gonna get a hair transplant and then i'm
just going to be like what it just i
went i just changed my style up it's not
a hair transplant
i just like i got it cut different and
then i guess it started growing back
um and then you're all going to be sorry
then you're all gonna be sorry man
i'm gonna start wearing a suit on stream
i'm gonna start streaming at 7am pacific
time
i'm gonna start getting a spray tan dude
i was talking with kate about
uh tanning it's crazy like um
i mean the way i understand it tanning
has deservedly
fallen out of fashion as people have you
know realized that it's
you know it gives you an incredibly
high oh i guess i shouldn't say
incredibly high
but a much higher risk of skin cancer um
and also is just you know ages you
prematurely as well
but it's crazy
i don't know if any if you're my age and
you know
the oc was super popular when you were
in high school
kids were like well like i say kids but
like high school students were
freaking like going tanning in like
their 10th grade like they're getting uh
they're getting they're going to tanning
salons they got like a 100
gift certificate for christmas from
their grandma and they're going to
tanning salons
it's like the the you know at the same
time we were in high school we're like i
wonder what's gonna like age badly about
mid 2000's culture because i feel like
we got it all figured out
like i'll tell you one thing uh letting
miners blast themselves with ultraviolet
radiation like just so that they can
look a little cooler
anyway down to the next floor
yeah yeah cause we're going to boss rush
hello baby
hello
hello
oh and frosted tips
oh
they don't get a lot of vitamin d down
in the mines okay haha when i said
miners
i meant you know
yeah exactly i don't know
i meant people under the age of 18.
if you're over the age of 18 and you
want to tan
that doesn't uh i mean it doesn't bother
me either way i suppose but at least
you're making like you're
an informed decision at that point
it is crazy to think about too like you
know when i turned 18
i was like finally like the law
recognizes that i'm like ready to
make my own decisions when you're 14
and you think of being an 18 year old
you think of somebody in like a three
piece
suit when i'm now i'm 32
i i think back at you know
both myself and also my friends at the
age of 18 and i was like
we were so insanely stupid
that's that's really young
i look back at myself at like 25 and i'm
like man i was pretty dumb
food poisoning isn't real what are you
thinking man
specifically mouth no not not so much
mouth
just in general hey baby
what about on crust tools no i stand by
that one
like i love meal prep i got nothing
against meal prep
um
but um meal prepping sandwiches doesn't
make any sense to me
that's that's one that i don't i don't
quite understand
i i stand by my position in the sandwich
argument
still eating fish and chips with cutlery
more people are good
the older my demographic gets the more
people are gonna
come to my side on that one i i firmly
believe
i think people will as as they as you
get older
there's a lot of graphs that that change
values when you're young your distaste
for doing the dishes
is like 99 you're like i'd rather cut
off
like an appendage than even freaking
touch the sink
you know you you scramble eggs you
you go i'm gonna eat the eggs you put
water in the eggplant and then you leave
it in the sink for like
you know two days and then you're like
hey why is your dirty pan in the sink
and they're like it's sulking
yeah for two days i don't think it's
soaking i think it's it's fermenting
anyway um ends
well that's all i got anyway so your
this taste for dishes is up here
your desire to do dishes as you get
older
actually goes up i think i i can't
figure out how to do this in in the
mirrored camera but
essentially i don't mind i mean kate
does the dishes most of the time and and
she can hear me so i'm not gonna
um try to pretend like i do more of the
dishes than she does
however doing the dishes doesn't bother
me now it's just something you gotta do
you know
every day or so in order to keep the
place tidy
so my desire to keep my hands clean
is way higher than my dis taste for
doing the dishes
i think most people or at least many
people
will reach a point at some point in
their lives where they decide you know
what i could just eat this with a fork
and then my hands won't get like kind of
oily and gross
and then i'll just wash like an extra
fork and knife after
uh after i eat because i mean those are
very easy pieces of
uh well they're very easy dishes to wash
in general
i eat some foods with my hands still you
know like if we go to mcdonald's i'm not
eating the french fries with a knife and
fork but
i mean you could persuade me to do it i
think
what am i doing okay boss rush that's
right gotta remember boss rush
can of corn
i don't see what you get out of it when
you eat it with your hands
i'm not trying to like dredge up the
argument this is more of like a
director's cut
it's a revisiting many years later um
like what i guess what you get out of
eating
fish and chips with your hands is you
don't
hold on have we been to our item room we
need to make boss rush you don't
have to dirty up a fork and or a knife
even though you could probably just use
the fork to
cut it up to begin with and i mean i
guess
people keep saying is easier i don't
think it's easier
i think they're the same difficulty like
our baby
uses a fork and she's not even seven
months old yet
so the the argument that one's easier
than the other
falls on deaf ears for me for the time
being um
what i think you get out of it i
honestly think it's like a
it's a a flex that's cursed eye
like i think it's one of those things
where it's like you know growing up
you only use a knife and fork to eat uh
pizza if you're like
an out of touch millionaire and uh i'm
not an out of touch millionaire i'm an
everyman i'm a man of the people so as a
result
i i identify with the hand eaters
i don't see it like that i don't i don't
see i don't think i'm better than
anybody else because i eat
fried foods with a fork and a knife
there may be some other reasons that
feed into the superiority complex
um i just think it's like i just prefer
not having oily hands is really what it
comes down to
i don't like having oily hands and then
constantly doing the gambit of am i
gonna wipe my oily hands knowing i'm
just gonna pick up the fish later in a
second anyway
and then have to you know it's the
nihilist napkin
i'm a fork and knife man yeah get me out
of here please
so you don't drink soup from the bowl
either i use it i use a spoon
um help me i use a spoon for the uh
for the soup
for sure
trying to figure out what you're saying
here i mean the the argument that you're
making of like you know the the trump
card of like
why not just use your fork and knife to
eat pizza
you're absolutely right i but it's not
the wild card you think it is instead
i'm like sometimes i do
it's just i don't know it just my my
hands feel nicer
i i you know not always it depends on
the uh
the situation like cold pizza from the
fridge usually i'll just grab it with my
hands
but like sometimes if the pizza's piping
hot i'll use a knife and fork man
and the only argument i've heard against
it is cultural which falls on deaf ears
for me
it's like you know who do you think you
are using a knife and fork to eat pizza
i'm like i'm the guy who doesn't want to
you know use four napkins to eat two
slices of pepperoni pizza i guess
who do you think you are i am
i think the important thing is both both
sides in the debate
feel like the other side is insane
that's what i've noticed there's logical
arguments in favor of both
i just prefer the logical arguments from
overuse of the fork and knife versus
underuse
yeah like oftentimes i mean it's been a
long time since i had a burger because i
haven't
you know been to a restaurant since you
know 2019.
um well that's not true but since 2020
for sure
but i use a knife and a fork to to eat a
burger sometimes
usually not the first few bites but if
it falls apart on me
they got the knife and fork there i'll
deconstruct it a little bit and eat it
that way
do you use a knife and fork on wings
i've been known to
i don't i don't find it that uh i mean
what's what's the argument against it
instead of like just
it's it's not the norm i don't
understand
honestly kind of based that's what i'm
saying man i've been telling you i'm
based for years
i mean i don't use like uh hold on we
gotta make boston i should think we to
make a sacrifice here
i don't use like a like with a chicken
wing i don't
slice a little piece off but i might use
a knife and fork to crack
like the joint on the bone and then
you know it's much easier to eat the
wing from that uh
from that position
i'm just not giving anybody any machismo
credit for
you know eating some something with
their hands just to do it
game ovaries 420
[Laughter]
what a name thank you thank you for the
gifted subs
thank you
i appreciate it
do you use a knife and fork with sushi
no
i mean i i don't use a fork for soup
either i use you know i use chopsticks
for sushi
a sandwich is preferable with your hands
for sure if it falls apart at the end
though
i'm not just eating it uh i'm not just
using my hands to pick up like you know
aioli drenched lettuce leaves or
whatever i'll use a knife and fork to
ensure that you get a a representative
cross-section of the sandwich
honestly you guys aren't invited to my
barbecue anyway so i wouldn't sweat the
decorum too much okay we're going
light path
i know what kind of dad chad is that's
what i'm realizing this is all coming
back to the barbecue bit
you're you're the dad that uh makes
comments about everything
whoa knife and fork huh what's that
about you like those shoes new balances
how do you feel about those
we had to do boss rush didn't we
i teleported out in order to go on the
light side path which we were gonna do
anyway
hold on it's still open right doesn't it
open until
20 minutes or is it when you go in it's
closed forever
it won't start now because you picked up
an item sonofa
that's true well on the other hand
f you know
maybe that guy was right maybe 20 less
banter would be good
by the way i saw apollo in chat hello
apollo
french fries fork or nah either or
like i i don't know i guess like the
i've misrepresented myself
by taking the position that like it's
categorically one or the other
the honestly
like it's it's whatever you're into
right
there's no reason to to not use a fork
in a lot of situations there's no reason
to use a fork like
you can do it's one of those foods you
could definitely do either or
no okay the the new rule if chad calls
out the tinted rock you're not allowed
to uh get it
oh there it is
why is there their packing tape going on
outside
some of the some of the sounds that that
exit my office
uh or that happen on the outside of my
office
are very scary out of context
if you go to a fast food restaurant do
you ask for cutlery
and these are just insane questions
asked by insane people
no i get it in a paper bag through the
drive-through
and then i eat it in my car while i'm
driving home and then when i get home i
throw out the empty bag
duh it's covered
the perfect crime stealing stealing food
from myself
uh judgment card please judgment card
i mean it's one of those and this is
like not ironic now or not uh
intended to lampshade but judgment card
my god he's almost a genius it's the
kind of argument like i have very little
patience for like the older i get it's
it's
um it's a cell phone so if you take
offense to it
it's a cell phone before you get mad i'm
insulting myself
it's really the currency of a man who
has too much time on his hands
is to get in these arguments about the
the social norms of
how to how to eat french fries right
we got bigger problems right now we
could talk about i
you know it's like the same thing i
bring up like whenever i i
talk about like how i i don't care if a
hot dog is a sandwich anymore or like
um what's the other one oh whether
do you think pineapple belongs on pizza
lol
i'm always like dude don't tell me that
dude just like why don't you talk about
like your values or something instead
like
why i would say i can't engage in these
arguments just
like for rhetoric's sake anymore
with friends yes with with strangers
like no it's just like
it's a waste of perfectly good uh
neurotransmitters
that's your brand though no it is but
not with
you with my friends
not with chat
you know when you have that foundation
where like the argument is for sport
because you have that rapport with one
another it's a different thing than uh
lemmington 1961 in chat
it's a different story
for chat i want to know more about um
you know what makes you tick what's your
perfect
sunday what's your desert island discs i
don't want to
you know if you put if a hot dog was in
a
bun and the bun had a top would you call
it a moon roof and i'm like i don't need
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
it's too much it's rhetoric for
rhetoric's sake
tell what makes you what makes you tick
what gets your gears going
not in that way i already know the
answer it's gente
i like that one i mean like on a
spiritual level
and don't say anime
when was the last time you called your
mom
what'd you say when was the last time
you told your mom
i love you instead of waiting for her to
say i love you and then you sang love
you too when was the last time you
initiated that
makes you think man
20 minutes ago all right that's pretty
good see i'm for that
don't stand there what if you don't love
your mom
um a wise man once said i love my baby
mama i never let her go
i think i walked into blue fires like
six times
light side path light side path
can you get mega mega mega satan if you
get two
keys um
no i don't i don't have a punch line for
that i got nothing by the way apollo i
saw you again you said don't say hi to
me five minutes after i'm here
hello hello apollo hello
you can't stop me
i like to acknowledge the streamers
it's nice to be watched by other
streamers you know
it's the greatest compliment you can get
on this website
i'm a streamer okay it's nice to be
acknowledging
i'm sorry the the punchline's too good
not to use though
i was gonna say i meant uh it's nice to
be acknowledged by other partnered
streamers
which i apologize
but it do be making me low though
yeah that's chivalry's got a great ratio
you know chibly
at at any given moment 10 percent of
chat has the
uh has the
the validation check mark you
remember i don't like all drama on like
streamers social media
not all drama but uh drama but all all
drama associated with like
the right way to behave on stream
is just like hilarious looking back do
you remember there used to be like
channels where if you uh if you came
into chat
with your verified partner badge they
would ban you because they didn't
want you chatting and possibly taking
viewers away from them from knowing that
other partnered streamers
existed that's that's so good
i love the idea that you'd be like if
you're gonna be in my chat
please remove your partner badge
otherwise
i'm gonna take it as advertising and
time you out
this is a very funny website
hello whoa sweet potato thank you
yeah follow apollo on twitter look you
can i'll let you advertise in my chat
dude anybody that's been on the nlss i'm
not going to tell you not to advertise

had to do it to him
but like the um the the actual mobster
from like the 1920s and 30s
and i'm like they if you ever want just
to have like uh
i mean they did some horrible stuff so
i'm not trying to make light of that
that being said if you ever want an easy
dose of uh comedy um
awkward segway uh-oh um
go look like just go to wikipedia
type in like the name of a famous uh
you know crime family from la cosa
nostra and then just
click on associates
and just i guess we'll be going up which
is good
um just look at all their gamer tags
it said tommy tommy gas pipe
higgins also known as uh timmy
leg breaker magoo
old pop bottle glass and you're like

meyer lansky okay meyer lansky is like
he was like a mafia account
you don't go to his name yet okay
now you click on charles lucky luciano
and then you go a little further okay so
you go to something like
um just find someone's name here we go
uh
joe adonis
other names okay this is not that good
this this one really burned me
also known as joey a joey adonis joe
adone joe rosa james arosa joe demio we

i'm trying i'm trying mike
michelle merlot other names mike merlot
all right you know what can it this
bit's going nowhere
how did i come across the only three
mafia members in history whose uh
nickname was just the short form of
their actual birth name
like that's just that's embarrassing
that hurts
plus i'm going to get freaking whacked
probably hey
he's making fun of our name get him
timmy tulip
i'm not timmy tulup i'm david daisy
also known as uh build a vegan butcher
what would your mob name be probably
something like
like hairy
this is my guess
dude we're gonna die what
happened to this run oh i know what
happened to this run you gotta do
mission failed all right i'm gonna go to
the bathroom and then we'll
i'm gonna come back and play some more
isaac though i think honestly i'm
feeling it today
i apologize to the variety marty's but
we'll we'll be back for
more isaac in just a moment here
temporarily
um how did this run fail bad boney



slash marker
new run we're back and this time i'm
never gonna lose
again
because i'm gonna oh god i already
clicked on it
it's too late it's too late everyone
chad's screaming no no
dude no no this is the time after four
hours of gaming
my brain is in a great position to play
his tainted jacob man we're gonna
one of these days we're gonna we're
gonna get him
one of these days we're going to get
them like look at this
so easy
chad it's time for your tainted jacob
run yes dear
cobalt killed the beast as tainted jacob
uh
good for cobalt uh call me when he
matches my feet of dying to dingle
as tainted jacob and then i'll be
impressed
hold on we need this i don't even know
this will probably help
yeah okay cobalt beat the beast uh has
he ever died to dingle
when i was a kid the only thing that
didn't have any that the only thing on
the menu that was
meatless was the hot dog dude
there oh and the music goes hard now
apollo are you still here
i got something to ask you
okay he's here i didn't have anything to
ask him i just wanted to bait him into
saying something
you must feel so silly right now
got him got him
bodied i got the kill shot we do a
little trolling here
that's the thing we do do a little
trolling i did watch uh
i did watch a little bit of uh of dan's
summoner's war stream
i mean it happened at such a like a late
time it was not possible to
uh to watch more than
you know like more than i should have to
be honest with like an hour or so but
it was uh it was an interesting
stream no doubt about that it was really
funny too that like
um you know probably like shooting my
chance of a potential sponsorship in the
future down
but like the korean stream was literally
like
a tv style production they had a
a huge stage uh you know like multiple
hosts and stuff like that
um and then the american one was like
three guys on an obviou with a couch and
an obvious green screen
like it was it was very funny
to me and nobody else but it was good i
i think he did pretty well all things
considered
almost got tagged there
i'm telling you there's an easy way to
win is this character
it's called a blank card emperor
if you can just get those hyper specific
combinations of items and consumables
then you're then you're safe
there is probably like i'll be honest
like a lot of the jacob and or
i guess specifically tainted uh jacob
runs
i've probably been the victim of my own
stubbornness
like i imagine if you get insanely
overpowered there might be a case to be
made for just
actually killing him every floor and
then like
just doing enough damage to the boss to
kill them easily because you have an
overpowered run but
or killing him after you no i don't know
if you're overpowered you'll usually
kill him by accident anyway
it's probably probably true probably
true
i don't know yeah then you die to a
to a spiked rock that's true
it's tough not an easy character
i guess you know like we i'm starting to
realize how clearly we threw away the uh
the cleaver run and um why
there was some degree of uh upset about
that
[Laughter]
the cleaver run is looking more and more
like a once in a
blue moon sort of deal
okay that that hurts a little but
you can also erase him with the eraser
if you calculate his hp
dude there's there's all sorts of stuff
that i have absolutely no confidence in
my own ability to work with
with this guy i'm honestly i'm a simple
man you know
i'm i'm like the brute force side sort
of guy
you know i'm the sort of guy you know if
if i hadn't already learned how to like
you know do
medullos i would simply write
fizzbuzz in nested loops that say
if input equals one write
one if input equals two write buzz
if input equals three etc etc
sorry we don't talk about fizz buzz i'm
more of a uh
spark mouth guy now boo hiss
minus two we hate it we hate it no you
love the
programmers love programmer humor
as long as it's not about like apple
like you can make
you can talk about macs you could talk
about windows but
as soon as you start to talk about apple
they get very upset
the ae can't quit vim
bro bro you use an editor
what are you doing you use an editor
you use an ide i just i i just use vim
you use vim dude that's great i remember
when i used to use vim then i switched
to emacs
i haven't looked back you use emacs
buddy free yourself from the chains of
the computer
start just putting your code in the
punch cards
and then feeding them into the machine
let me
this guy is using
here's what you do okay you get the idea
you get you understand now you
understand where we're going okay it was
good good floor deal with the angel next
floor please
oscar predictions it starts in like two
hours
i'm gonna be honest with you i don't
know if i um
watched a movie from 2020. i don't know
if i saw a movie
in 2020 that came out in 2020
i'm trying to think i'm like
i honestly wait
okay i saw seoul yay i saw seoul
i think that's it i don't think i saw
another movie that came out in 2020
wait okay i saw onward as well i think
onward also came out in 2020 but that's
okay and borah too you're absolutely
right i did see borat too
as well so i i believe i saw
three movies from uh
from the year 2020 out of those three
movies
congratulations to best picture winner
seoul best actor will be going to
um sasha baron cohen
for borat too best actress
i'm gonna say that that's gonna go to
um the lady who played the soul
in seoul
congratulations best wardrobe
that's gonna go to um
the the costume designer for borax
because it's the only movie that takes
place
in the real world uh
you get the bid you understand the bit
best original music would go to seoul
because it was a movie about music
rudy rudy is nominated for me he's
nominated for best supporting
go ahead make my day best cinematography
i'm going to be honest with you i don't
know what cinematography is
and i'm not sure that anybody does
is when movie look nice right
like when uh daenerys uh
sacks king's landing and then she's
walking down the stairs and drogon
spreads his wings behind her so it looks
like they're freaking her wings dude
like that's like the prototypical
example of good uh
of good cinematography i think roger
deacons
um eat your fart out
the mud pie guy from i think you should
leave got nominated for best actor
i know who stephen ewan is he's not
just the mud pie guy from i think you
should leave
he's also criminally wasted on
300 seasons of the walking dead as glenn
he has a resume
he's he's more than just the mud pie guy
come on
kill me kill don't kill me yet
kill me kill me
you don't get any iframes
kill me you don't get any iframes
in that section um obviously i shouldn't
have done it like that
you don't get a lot of street cred for
being like well you shouldn't have done
it like that
that's evident based on the result
achieved
that being said i also thought there
were some
frames of invincibility perhaps um
that was naive of me and i apologize
hey chocolate milk that's pretty good
[Laughter]
you thought wrong hello steeger
i also acknowledge game developers in
this chat
but only steam developers
if i ask you what games you made and you
send me an itch link
it's on site
what a shot blocked
no no on-site in the oh hello corey
on-site in the good way
like we're as soon as i see you we're
gonna we're gonna hug
board games oh no board games it's on
site and we're throwing down
throwing down the weapons we use to
wound one another in everyday
life and instead finding a common ground
on which we can interface says
if not friends at least co-existing
human beings
you know
yeah unless you work for milton bradley
more like milton
milton badly needs to stop making so
many good games
because i can't i don't have time to
play them all
you know what i mean i i got nothing
dude it feels great to be caffeinated
though dude i'm telling you
feels good
apollo are you still here what if we got
the gang back together
for one session of pubg
can i get a temperature on that from
absolute zero to surface of the sun
i got to imagine like at some point
you've played so much among us that the
concept of having
uh literally anything else on your
screen has to appeal to you this is this
is called buying low
i don't have a good impetus for it as
well
the the impetus is just i thought about
pub g
and it's been long enough that i was
like i i for i forgot that it's
not fun
so in my head i'm like maybe it'll be
fun
i know it won't be
[Laughter]
but i can still believe for right now
don't hit me don't hit me
don't hit me
dude dub ludo now dude the bluetooth duh
pluto how to underneath probably ruins
chocolate milk
probably ruins our whole run but
i'm i'm mostly here for the memes at
this point this one goes out to the
person who said has nl ever found a
wacky card look at that we got our first
wacky card
uh of this run we did have i think we
had a
temperance earlier which i don't know
what it does at the end of it it spit
out a bunch of hearts
but prior to that it uh hurt us a few
times and generated some consumables or
something it was it was a weird one
it force feeds you five pills
problematic
freeze that's the wrong button
freeze got him
i'm dom is the problem i'm dumb
bro i gotta i gotta blow it up we gotta
blow it up i'm not clip farming as you
can see
i'm not clip farming otherwise we would
have died when we tried to go down there
100 devil deal
dude i'm let me show you how i'm not
afraid i am
i knew it i knew it
devil dabble okay
that's a lot of spirit hearts that
doesn't help us if we become the lost
that's just like that's just ignorant
where's my ludo oh hello oh
hello gaming heavy gaming
okay next thing i need i need the
ability to fly
because this is i'm running into some
trouble
you know that ad you ever played trouble
the board game as a kid
that ad is full of crap man it's not fun
getting into trouble at all
okay maybe this is actually incredible
getting into trouble it sends a chill
down your spine
doing something that could get you into
trouble
maybe maybe
getting caught for doing something that
could get you into trouble
that's when you're like oh dude
when you when you hear your your teacher
say your name
when you're about to like i don't even
know like do something you're not
supposed to do in class
maybe you've been talking with your
friend you're laughing it up hey they
don't hear me they don't hear me
and then it's clear that they heard you
it's that classic bit you're not wrong
sewing
yes yes reaping
no no don't kill me or whatever um
should have definitely used the charge
here but whatever
no i got i i was a good student but i
got in trouble
uh a lot
in like minor trouble in like ninth
grade
because i was you know talking to my
friends in class and stuff like that
um but i still maintain the reason i got
in trouble
was because my voice was like this in
ninth grade
which made it very easy to uh
figure out who was talking
puberty removed my my plausible
deniability
when it removed the hair on the top of
my head as well
and then gave me hair on the rest of my
body which was
which was nice um
i broke my second grade teacher's nose
by accident with a basketball
dude this is pretty messed up
i mean you did say by accident but like
i don't know man i gotta think i gotta
know more about the
the situation surrounding that
before i i give you the the pass i
suppose
okay like this is just incredible
i'm like just okay hit me but then
let me grab this now okay get out of
here no
don't kill him know what is happening go
go go
just go just go
okay
all right so this is a hypothetical if
in theory we were to kill him we would
become the lost
how do we not die
from that point onwards and don't say
don't get hit that's not the answer i'm
looking for
this you're not wrong it's probably
gonna kill him every time
holy mantle okay that's right holy
mantle would help out a great deal
don't hey don't touch this dude now it's
an escort mission
is no longer
avoid him now it's it's protect him
finish off the room without him walking
into this
no please please
no
don't don't touch it don't touch it dude
what the heck is happening man
okay just relax it's not that big of a
deal you don't need to you don't need to
scream like that that's
there's no need to yell
just chill dude so it's very simple uh
as soon as ipak hits anything
it explodes
certainly complicates things uh
we just gotta we just gotta relax
just gotta slow our roll most
enemies will die very quickly oh
it's not that bad as long as you like
literally never stand like next to a
rock or
anything
keep it wedged up in the corner there no
not like this
i have no means to stop
spiders would kill us we gotta we gotta
be much more careful
whatever dude it is what it is get me
out of here
i think the dream is uh
oh thank you hot the shadows thank you
i mean this is a very me type run right
here for sure so
if if you're a fan of the unique flavor
we bring to the
situation this this should be uh this
should be up your alley
um i feel like the dream
is we get emperor cards
i mean i don't even know why i'm doing
this now that i think about it like what
do we care about
spirit hearts if we get emperor cards
we can beat the bosses before tainted
esau spawns
if we don't it's okay
you just have to beat the rooms fast
enough
that he doesn't take damage
how is this kind of working
don't come this way please
the fool oh no oh they okay
whatever whatever
just do it do it no no no no no
we hit him pretty good i think oh god
he spawned right in the center of it man
oh geez
in the eye of a hurricane there is
quiet for just a moment
okay well now we're the lust and that's
okay just don't get hit
[Laughter]
now we can get okay with the dog the
rocks watch out for rocks man
emperor
go ahead pop up
i'm becoming the joker
crack dota thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you much appreciate
this is the one man this is the one
okay note to self ipac
good brimstone good
epic plus brimstone no no no no no
see this dude don't get me wrong variety
is great
we're gonna have some variety tomorrow
without a doubt but um
isaac
it's not much but it's honest work clip
farming
the the worst part is that i could have
just left but you know what it's
it's that hubris that that makes it uh
that makes it funny
i'm still a little shocked
but we'll we'll get through it can of
corn
for any students during the pandemic how
the heck do you stay
focused dude i hear you like i i was a
good student
i would not be a good student
for during distance learning
the fact that there's so many
distractions possible
i think is you know makes it hard to
focus for sure
bff's okay
if it's any consolation though depending
on uh
how old you are and and what uh you know
level of scholastic
uh ability you're at it's probable that
um much of the things that you're
learning
don't matter anyway so that makes you
feel i don't know if it makes you feel
better or worse but
either way
there it is thanks
[Laughter]
yeah sure hit me whatever what are you
gonna do hit me
not not a spider please i i can't die to
a spider man
i can't pick up the freaking broaden
hearts
okay hold on tomo would like to uh tomo
would like to come in
again please get in the box my timer is
running
my timers running chad i got a question
for you
what the heck does it mean
when you're double parked
saved ruined
i always thought double parked was when
you parked
in two spots at once because that just
makes logical sense
but i have heard some people say is when
you don't
pay for the parking meter
is that correct it's one of those things
i get confused
don't hit me with the question marks i
always thought it was when you parked in
two spots simultaneously
but i've heard some discourse that it's
like oh when you've got to feed your
meter you say you're double parked
i thought it was neither of those what
the heck does double park mean it's when
someone blocks you in
no no no no no no because they use it in
the context of like hey go fast i'm
double parked
it's when you park to block somebody
else in
why would you ever park like that it
just makes you kind of like a d-hole
yeah don't i mean look um this is easy
to moralize but why are you why'd you
park like that
bro
it seems like you don't know how to
drive or at least you don't care for
other people and
i'll tell you one that you definitely
don't respect the
silence that serves as the foundation of
creativity
it's when someone is parked at the side
of the road and you park right next to
them
why are there so many definitions for
what double parking is
like
yeah also why would you do that why
would you park on the
road and block somebody else in
that was beautiful because it's fun
insubordinate and churlish yeah maybe
it's a regional thing
maybe it's a new york thing i will say
there's a
i forget what oh no i totally remember
what the show was called on tlc
yesterday i caught 10 minutes of a show
uh it was called hustle and toe
a pun on of course hustle and flow the
movie for what
which terence howard one uh best actor
um and it's a show about you know
these tow truck drivers in america
and they were they were spotlighting
like a tow truck driver in uh
new york and only in new york
um and they were like yeah we gotta go
cause we got a call about a car like
blocking a driveway
and then i expected them to drive up and
it would just be a car block in a
driveway
nah it was a car that had been freaking
smashed like rear-ended and then like
crashed into a house
and then they had to tow away the car
that got hit and the guy was like why
are you towing my car i got into an
accident and i was like
you know the man has a point seems like
a bad day
crawl space i suppose there's a chance
why not
there you go
i've lived all across this great land
how did we not get hit
and nobody ever says double parked
unless they mean
parked in two different spaces see that
i mean that's why
it's double parked right
planetarium chance next floor as well
like maybe that's why it started is
double parked and then it's also taken
on like an extra meaning that man is
lying
it's parked beside someone so they can't
get out
the heck man what is double
parked park a vehicle
alongside one that's already double
parking can refer to parallel parking
to a car already parked double parking
in attendant car parks and garages
multi-space parking or taking two
metered spots with one vehicle
what the hell are we doing here is life
not hard enough
it's every single one i can't believe it
we were all right it's the it's the
light side outcome
use the useful word it means
you're parked in a way that you're not
supposed to be parked
now we know the rest of the story
let me out dude
oh don't even get me started on
bi-weekly
is it is it twice a week is it once
every two weeks
isn't it like it's once every two weeks
and
wait no it's twice a week and
quasi weekly is once every two weeks or
something like it's just
it's stupid man just just write twice a
week

thank you thank you
joker in front of the microphone dot
jpeg
oh you guys are ready for that one but
your kids are gonna hate it
did you watch mr rogers when you were
younger um
i caught some episodes as uh as a
youngster
in between masterpiece theater and
sesame street
you know what's a great i got a great
idea for you if you ever ever find
yourself bored
and you need to pass the time um i'd
like to introduce you to a website
called common sense media
it is a website where people submit
reviews for movies but um
from the perspective of like parents
trying to figure out if a movie is
appropriate to watch with their kids
and then what you're gonna do as soon as
you get there is look up reviews
for the most vulgar and violent
movies that you can possibly find and
then
read the reviews
i i was there yesterday i looked up some
reviews on uncut gems
there's great reviews that come down on
both extremes
some of the like the the best uncut gems
reviews were like people that were like
i guess if you don't mind hearing the f
word or even a couple of gds this movie
could be okay
but every other word is
you know you get the idea um
and then the other uh side of it
i saw a review of uncut gems that was
like
uh it said recommended for
kids over the age of six which is just
absurd
like i love uncut gems but that's just
insanity
um and then it said this will show your
kids the real world not the fake world
of disney
it's like this guy this guy's got
problems they need to somebody needs to
check on this guy because uncut gems is
not like the real world that i lived in
but uh it's a great website
you you get to see a great cross-section
of humanity
if we die here maybe we'll read some
walls
or uh some some common sense media
reviews
is the other one another uncut gems one
that got me good was like
not only is there swearing and violence
but the movie starts with a colonoscopy
and i was like you gotta
now you got a problem with colonoscopies
too
it's not just like vulgar language it's
also like
you oh medical procedure like i get it
you don't want your kid to maybe
see adam sandler's butthole but like
it's not it's not that big of a deal
but then it also has um
like this is i don't know if it's
machine learning tags or something like
that but it has um
oh my god dude we're just gonna get
toasted is is guaranteed it's on site
um it has like a parental guide for like
if you watch this movie with your kids
here's some topics you can talk about
and the uh for uncut gems is just
delusion
like it's like they're grasping at
straws they're like talk about the
reason that someone might
get involved with illegal sports betting
and uh
what what it was you know what would you
have done if you were in his shoes how
would you prevent it his situation
and you're like uh i think if you got to
have those conversations with your kid
it's uh
maybe not the right time to be watching
uncut gems with them
also the consequences of these actions
are made apparent
uh okay dude there's a chance there's a
chance
did the egg do any variety today yes
we started as uh
tainted bethany we we moved on we did
some tainted azel runs
um
now we're doing tainted jacob i think we
did some lazarus runs in the middle as
well
oh so that's how that works
that's unfortunate
you can only look at three reviews for
free on the site
okay that i did not know i already
looked at
um
uncut gems and also once upon a time in
hollywood so
maybe when this is done we'll look at
one review
look at mid-summer dude i don't think
you should watch mid-summer
it's like the opposite of like what age
do you have to be to watch it i think it
should be like if you're over the age of
50 like just stay away
this movie is only for people between
the age of
19 and 49.
yeah the descriptions are so good too
because they're always like
they're they're written in such like an
objective
like uh humorless way they do like
one character appears drunk throughout
the movie and is made to look like a
fool as a result
hollow heart a brittle blessing
you know what they got me out of there
review of pulp fiction says
endlessly offensive and devoid of
humanity
well they got you there hey that's not
true
when he accidentally shoots uh marvin
in the face there's some humanity there
everybody's had a moment where they can
relate to vincent vega when he goes oh
man maybe you never shot anybody in the
face but
you know you've had a moment where you
had an accident where you went like oh
come on
one of the top reviews for sausage party
says omg not for kids at all
don't get me wrong like you know as a
new parent myself
uh i i can understand the value of
having a website
if you're a kid who's like on the
borderline of the age that you might
consider appropriate and you'd be like
let's you know let's see specifically
what happens in this movie to see if it
might be appropriate or inappropriate
but like some of them that are so
obvious you're just like
you know
you kind of like come on you know like
reservoir dogs you probably like
saw dogs in the title thought animated
movie like balto
instead guy's ear gets sliced off what
the
oh good why not
it's an incredibly blessed series of
seeds honestly
like i can't really i can't really front
in that in that capacity
dead alive thought funny zombie movie
not funny zombie movie
gruesome lawnmower scene made my child
have nightmares and she stopped doing
her yard work
you know like uh body
movie funny look at the movie smile dude
just
give me brimstone you know you're gonna
give me brimstone here like don't beat
around the bush
just give me brimstone
they are very so some of the reviews
just
make you realize that like ned flanders
was based on a real person
you know and he doesn't believe in
insurance
he considers it a form of gambling
thank you linger bean did you have to
okay
take me to the next floor
[Laughter]
yeah nobody knows what linger bean does
and that's why
i love it
what's the best doritos flavor let me
hit you
let me hit you with something okay in
canada
and maybe in other markets there's a
doritos flavor called
sweet chili heat
my personal favorite doritos flavor
i also like cool ranch
of course
um i'm not gonna say no to nacho cheese
100 devil deal baby but nacho cheese is
would not be my favorite
okay just go ahead and give me brimstone
here thank you
just kidding that one was to trick the
audio only listeners
now immediately ruin of babylon
and head down to the next floor
dude i also i've been talking about it
before you know the chips
i got some of those and like i think i
got like zesty
chili lemon and i was like
this is pretty good next time i went
i got uh haunted ghost pepper
it's like they're really spicy
like they were they were spicy enough to
be like
like i was going like whoo i was going
like
that's how spicy they were you don't
expect the snack food to be that spicy
that you can buy in like a grocery chain
but they were they were that spicy
ryan everybody i know is talking about
air fryers
dude i'm what can i say
they're good they're the air fryer it
turned me into a uh
into a believer if you don't want one
that's fine
but like you know if you're wondering
why everyone's talking about them it's
because they're uh they're good
yeah get with the times or get left
behind
why would i get an air fryer when i have
an oven it's one of those things do
where i'm like
honestly i don't even know who you are
if you don't want to make your life
better by getting an air fryer i'm not
going to waste
you know the limited amount of time that
i have on god's green earth trying to
explain it to you for the tenth time
you know you can just you know just live
with your oven okay it's no big deal
i like literally could not care less
for anybody that's open to new things um
and maybe has a bit of a discretionary
budget then by all means consider
at least in you know having an
opportunity to use an air fryer before
you judge it and if you deem it
unworthy of being in your kitchen
alongside the paper plates and red solo
cups then
you know by all means abstain otherwise
you know we welcome you to the to the
barbecue
quick he needs cold brewstead
[Laughter]
um i don't need a key i'll just get a
planetarium on the next floor
i ate from the airfryer
twice this weekend including once today
i made some pierogies in it today i had
some chicken strips in it
on saturday uh planetarium
no planetarium f
would you rather get rid of your air
fryer or your microwave is not even
close the microwave is on site
we're fighting
here's what i would say the the air
fryer
is run dude i thought it might work but
i was
i was planning on killing him anyway the
uh
the air fryer has a similar
value to the microwave in the sense that
it reheats food fast
but i would say it takes three times
longer to reheat the food
however the food that you reheat in it
is 10 times
better
which kitchen appliances could you
destroy in a single punch
i'm just thinking um
just thinking the answer may well be
none you know i
i can't i can't disagree any
you know anything with a glass window
but even then i'm like
i'm pretty sure i could not punch
through my microwave in a single hit
dude let's do you dare me
no okay let's do it
i don't even know how this works
with with ipack i think with
one punch i mean can i punch it off of
like the
the kitchen counter onto the floor
because then anything glass
oh that wasn't all that took his buddy
in a box
i was like this hasn't changed anything
boy i really hope they do something
about that
don't know i don't know if there's a
kitchen appliance i could reasonably
break in a single punch
certainly if i hit my toaster i would
expect that it would still function
i don't think i could punch through my
microwave door
coffee maker maybe like i mean i guess
if you count break in the pot
as uh
why not um
i mean
plum fly what do you what do you even do
don't do it okay
but like i if we get hit we just we just
die and respawn outside of the room
right
[Laughter]
can of corn baby
what kind of air fryer do you have brand
wise
i'll tell you it's not the one
where you can hack it and like uh
it connects to the internet and you can
burn somebody's house down
a couple people linked to me they were
like hey did you know there's a
vulnerability in some air fryers that
lets you like
uh malicious actors can connect remotely
to your air fryer
and just
started cooking whenever they want and i
was like thank you for letting me know
and scaring me but we don't have that
one
thankfully when in general i try to buy
the dumbest appliances possible
i have no desire for a smart fridge i
no i even like but beyond the malicious
possible aspect
is it's it's also just like it's privacy
i don't want
i don't want hackers to know like how
much sparkling water i drink they're
gonna judge me
like
there's there's been days
i've probably had like six cans you know
i'm
i don't i don't need a hacker to know
that and then like
tweet about it be like look how many
cans of sparkling water this guy drank
today
people will be like oh come on man what
do you
you love aluminum
you got you got access to an aluminum
mine or something like that
come on don't put me on blast like that
i believe that i mean there's some smart
devices like changing your thermostat
from your phone instead of going to
like the console on the wall that's a
nice thing yeah
i can see the value there now chat's
going to hit you with the oh
i have to walk all the way to my wall
but that's because like i i think that
there's like a bias
especially online that you can only like
the exact right amount of convenience is
the amount of convenience um
that we presently have and if you add
like people are so
skeptical about like new inventions and
stuff like that
95 percent of the people that you meet
in real life you have to remember if
they had been alive
in the late 19th century they'd be like
motorized carriage
when i got to feed my horse
oh my horse is too slow
it's the fastest animal in north america
but it's oh
it's too slow for me where are you going
that you need to go faster than that
oh mr big shot i didn't realize you need
a motorized
carriage what a horse isn't good enough
for you you think you're better than me
i thought that would work honestly um
that being said chat was right about
quibby okay i wanted
you know there's been a lot of
revisionist history i never said
quibby's gonna take off all i said was
why are you so
skeptical about quibby that it has a
chance
in hindsight it did not have a chance
but only in hindsight
i got all these freaking quibby shares
worth nothing
it was gonna be the next big thing they
made it was like netflix for phones
how could it go wrong
anyway i could see the value of like a
smart like the smart home integration
i can understand
it really isn't or like even just having
like your lights synced up to it but
i don't need like a smart fridge like i
this the smart fridge is like the
the perfect example for me of like
just cause you can doesn't mean you
should
i'm like what what's the point of a
smart fridge like it's
some of the things that run out in my
fridge
i want them to not get reordered um
automatically right like if i buy ice
cream i don't want it to restock
i'll die i'll just keep eating it i need
that
artificial scarcity
hold on what did we take we took the
negative take me down to the paradise
city
there's ones that show you the inside
like look okay i'm not saying there's no
use
i imagine like there will be times where
you're at the grocery store and you'll
be like
do we have this and you will have a
disagreement with your partner
i we definitely have it i know we have
it i don't think we have it
but then you can just look at your phone
and be like look
we don't have it it's not in there that
being said i'm like
i just i i don't see the use or the ones
that are like you can see inside without
opening the door
i'm like it saves you the electricity
from opening the door that being said it
uses 10 times more electricity to power
the liquid crystal display
but if you ignore that it's a pretty
great idea
flush is so bad uh how about get banned
flush is my favorite item how dare you
dude we're actually gonna make post-it
note progress here this is so
stupid we're gonna do we're gonna do
really well
dude if a smart fridge had a liquid
swords display
the heck is this orphan socks oh we go
oh
no um spikes don't hurt us anymore right
something like that
explain uh when the mcs came
to live out their name and to perform
some had to
yeah yeah rat jam if you're living in
the world today
you'll be here in the slang that the wu
tang say
etc etc picture blood baths and elevator
shafts
or don't you know it's your life
it's only one of the greatest rap albums
ever
no
one life baby one life
get him twitter do your thing
don't talk to me
that one scene from planet of the apes
apes together strong
that one
not like this
not like this
what the heck anna masoli didn't do i
did a lot
what
[Laughter]
flushed
keep it moving let's go
okay
he's done it there you go that dude
mini me sounds you're absolutely right i
was i was actually gonna say this guy
got me sounding like mini-me don't want
any of these yet
yet we don't want any
we don't want any of these yet we want
this
and then to suck it up
that's a tough it's a tough call
i think we're not going to
deliberately kill
uh esau yet
because it might be worth it to have
some
hp
ouch
what what's hitting me what what's
hitting me the skull the skull is
hitting you
oh no no
you



all righty he wasn't even in the
departed
that's what i'm saying man
that's what i've been trying to tell you
people
hey dude it feels like we should have
had like more on the posted note done
but
we got to remember we got that whole
border there dude we haven't played
tainted lilith in so long
peas don't even come depotted that's
what i'm trying to say
man i'm looking for some non-frozen
departed peop
okay sorry we're
i'm when i told my friends i wanted to
be a stand-up comedian
everybody laughed at me well nobody's
laughing now
did you know so everybody knows dan does
not like
um peas
depotted or otherwise did you know
and this kind of blew me away this guy
doesn't like
corn either what's up with that
i think he's just i if you
put something into fried rice i think
dan
is just gonna hate it like he wants his
fried rice to literally just be like
boiled chicken breast and and white rice
that's it man i can't when he said he
didn't like
corn i was like what the heck is this
guy talking about
i mean it's not my favorite vegetable
but to not like it
is like it's his personal choice don't
get me wrong but it's it's just
surprising as all
we're free
i don't mind it
is there usually corn in your fried rice
on occasion
there's you you can get fried rice that
has
little uh you know like textural
uh circuit breakers in it corn peas
little cubed carrots and stuff
no it's not dan's game it's pretty good
corn mixed in with rice is good man it's
not just for livestock
all right well i guess never had a
choice
i tried to let you live by the way
now instead you're gonna have to give me
magic mush
or i'm gonna become the joker
all right that's good enough joker
averted
you know what i i think we go boss rush
hush dark side path
yeah yeah yeah it's no longer in the
boss pool
going offline guys going back online
guys it's not that bad but it is
modestly disappointing at least
like
now i got to come up with new commentary
for like what the
the best possible item you can get there
is
going online guys yeah it turns out this
is my job
i'm gonna i'm gonna keep it moving
anyway booster pack is the new magic
mush
yeah booster pack's a pretty great item
uh for me to poop on
okay now this is pog
mix it up baby mix it up
i haven't watched you in a while i don't
remember you talking like you're from
boston
i'm not talking like i'm from boston the
bit was
ben affleck who is from boston
at the grocery store
asking for peas that have been taken
out of their pods aka
depoded which sounds very similar to the
way that someone from boston would
describe the movie the departed
i didn't think i had to explain every
single joke
to the point that it wasn't humorous
anymore but
apparently there's no room for subtext
on this website
dad you're scaring me you disgust me
murray
what do you get when you mix a
non-frozen vegetable
with a society that pronounces their
r's like oz
you get what you freaking deserve
dude they should make they should make
the joker from boston
j-o-k-j-o-k-a
joker
hey what are you turning into the joker
or something
dude you think the climate is right for
my seth rogen tick tock to finally go
viral
now that i have some virality under my
under my belt
last year when i was coming up with tick
tocks
um i
made a tick tock that was seth rogen's
face painted as the joker and then
the text said smoker and then the sound
on the tick tock was just the sound of
seth rogen laughing
and nobody laughed
at all everybody was like this is
the worst thing i've ever seen i still
think it's hilarious
[Laughter]
oh man the world wasn't ready for that
one
it did not do well
still isn't ready
no everybody on tick tock loves seth
rogen they know who he is
they're like you're the pottery guy the
pottery head
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah we're going
bassresponse
boss russ
yeah let's say you're not wrong if
chibly said it like
people would lose their mind lull so
true
meanwhile i make dozens of on par or
better jokes
and everybody ices me
like i thought chibley would be stoked
when i told him that there was a
sanskrit philologist
known as panini but he didn't even bat
an eye man
he didn't even like he didn't even say
low
or erm he just like
didn't even respond
that's not how it's pronounced it's how
it's spelled
it's definitely spelled like panini
it's not that funny you don't think it's
funny that one of history's greatest
minds is named the same thing as a
hot sandwich i think it's pretty
hilarious quite frankly
i honestly i think it might be one of
the funniest things i've ever heard
again that's not how it's pronounced or
spelled
if i were to write it it's i would write
panini
but really i'm just trying to drum up
some more attention like i'm just trying
to get
some panini press you know
nice try
plus two let's go baby back on to back
on top
plus two plus two it's the power of a
fully caffeinated
battle station man the bits are
connecting again
i've got some coherence in the bits the
incoherence is by design
like it's the caffeine man
hey don't tell me to f off you f off
friend off like don't be my friend
anymore because you're
saying mean things to me um
i say no six six cents for a roon six
cents for a rune
yeah yeah yeah just want to go down the
ladder
fly away pelican six san bricano's not
so bad
what's plus two minus two it's just math
it's just a math meme chat's really into
math lately
they're all members of the the facebook
group i freaking love science
which mostly serves to sell t-shirts
that say pluto's still a planet to me
did you see the uh
unsealed facebook internal documents
where they announced they had
more american users
in the 18 to 24 and 25 to 39
age group than actually exist in the
united states of america
wild man how'd they do that
that's that's good customer acquisition
right there
man that's crazy
yeah it's only 20 million more it's like
a rounding error
like built to spill they forgot to carry
the zero
freaking shaved okay now the cats are
shedding
all the cat hair gets into the mustache
and it gets stuck
it's like you don't even need a little
mustache anymore because you can just
get a cat hair mustache instead
hey i got a theory about um lip balm
i would say it's it's one of those
correlation causation things you know
that old song and dance
i didn't use lip balm very often
okay then my lips got a little chapped
i started using lip balm now that i'm
using lip balm
my lips get chapped all the freaking
time
riddle me this blistex
how does that happen it's like my it's a
deodorant thing it's a gateway drug
it's because it's not lip balm it's cork
grease
you ever do that
put cork grease on your lips instead of
lip balm accidentally in music class
no me neither my music teacher told me
not to
i think it's a conspiracy theory man
i also think it's like um
i think they put salt in the lip balm
but then also when i play as the tainted
characters i'm biting my lips
like i'm in confession you know
gotta concentrate that's true i am a
little bit more dehydrated
this is an honest to goodness truth i've
stopped drinking so much water during
the streams
because i like not going to the bathroom
as much we've really
like minimized our bathroom time during
the streams
to like one and i think it's a lot
better like i feel like the streams
maintain more momentum that way
i'm not sitting here in um
in torture and then after the stream i
just drink like eight cans of sparkling
water in
like an hour and a half i think the body
just figures it out
we don't need it
don't need it
don't want it
can't stand it
wouldn't be caught dead with it
would be insulted to carry it around on
my person
don't even know what it does quite
frankly
hold on actually it's bookworm right
silly edmond that's not a book that's a
game cartridge
sure hope somebody got fired for that
blunder
dude you think we could squeeze this out
through the
come on what are you stalling stalling
okay yeah because we want to do boss
rush okay yeah
keep them keep it moving keep it moving
there's a tinted rock in here
so true look at that absolutely correct
dude sulfuric tear with tainted lilith
is kind of cool
that's kind of neat
there's another tinted rock right there
go get them
so true bestie
dude i'm crazy ever since we talked
about barbecues i've been craving a
barbecue now i can't remember the last
time i went to a freaking barbecue
same here dude i'm telling you
come on that's like an insult 44 cents

i'm not paying 15 i'm paying 15 cents
for an hp
well i flip the saucy when the earth
will do it for you mate
got to get your yearly hot dog in you're
not wrong though is like the thing
i don't think i've had a hot dog yet
this year
i like to get about one a year
and i i haven't had a chance yet because
the canuck stadium is closed
and i you know don't find myself at
7-eleven that much anymore
we really flawless three bosses huh
serving hot dogs at my wedding dude
now that's an idea the food by the way
at josh's wedding
food was great had some delicious salmon
caesar salad but i think if i was at a
uh if i was at a wedding and they served
like you know a foot long
hot dog oh dude that open open hot dog
bar
with all the fixes now we're talking
that sounds like something you'd see on
marriage or mortgage jay you had one
yesterday come on
come on man i feel like
honestly there's parts of america or
maybe like the whole country
where i'm i'm really jealous of kind of
like the gas station
convenience store culture like we don't
have
good convenience stores in canada
like i i've never met anybody well
except for me and university
that would be like you know hey like
it's 11 p.m you want to swing by the
uh the 7-eleven and get some taquitos or
whatever
get some some two-dollar big bite hot
dogs we don't really we don't have like
a sheets quick stop
wawa type deal here
a lot of other countries do not not just
the u.s you know
um japan has some great uh convenience
stores korea's got some great
convenience stores
there goes my luck upgrade
dude book of the dead is popping
i'm a little jealous
what kind of mom would kate be at the
barbecue
two white claw sunglasses mom
that's that's my uh that's my assessment
and you know what she deserves she's
been working hard on the baby
that's a mood
perfect description
[Laughter]
treat yourself
we're gonna have to put in a little bit
of a rush here in order to make boss
rush we're gonna have to become
rush boss is we're gonna have to
we're gonna have to rush these bosses
down frick yeah barbecue baby
yeah yeah tuesday hot dog baby tony
montana
tuesday taquito baby taquito tuesday
we're on pace it's just gonna be close
thoughts on the sopranos tony
soprano two no no no oh we have an
emperor card what am i talking about we
we could just
get there man um
are you making fun of uh steak monday
no i wouldn't be i wouldn't be caught
dead making fun of steak monday it's
just
a bit that popped into my head unrelated
to tony montana monday baby 20 month
tony tuesday baby
how do you know when it's time to shave
your head
um
i would say like for me i just got
sick and i apologize for people that
have heard this before it does come up a
lot
i got sick of like on windy days always
looking um
in like shop windows to see if my
meticulously quaffed hairs still look
the same
as it did when i left the house
uh i knew like i would i had a receding
hairline for sure
but i didn't have like open you know
bald spots or anything like that so i
feel like
i i pulled the plug a little earlier
than a lot of people
but i guess what i would say honestly is
that like the younger you are the faster
you got to pull the rip cord
because you know if you're like in your
mid 30s and you you've got a little
balding going on is
it can be dignified at least for a while
but if you're like 18
and you you're starting to get a
horseshoe like you you got to go before
the horseshoe comes out
because you're you know you can't take
those graduation photos again
you can't be showing up to prom looking
like kevin from the office you know
so true hair is pretty weird don't get
me wrong
dude we're gonna have to we're gonna
have to go
i just want to get like one last item
maybe hey
what the we have no keys oh
please faster
i started to lose my hair and i just
pulled the long con
and started to grow it long look
i'm not gonna pop a bubble for you
we still got a little time okay we have
no time
um oh hey cobalt what's up
hope you're doing well i saw your your
scuttle butt on tainted jacob i will
keep you posted
tainted jacob by the way probably my
most played character
also my least successful character right
now which you know you could probably
figure out for yourself why
but i'm here to tell you i don't think
long hair
to counter baldness is gonna last
as long as that's not a long con that's
a very short con
you can get away with it if you are the
front man for like a heavy metal band
it'll stay open no
bro oh my god dude
dark path dark path yeah i was so upset
proptosis
thank you alexander hamilton
book of the dead's gonna do work here
okay that was close
again i'm not trying to pop that bubble
for you i'm just saying like
if it worked you would see it more often
on young people you see it on older
gentlemen from time to time
hey hey no i'm not much of a bushy beard
guy
i just find i find it uncomfortable when
when my beard gets
too long i shave uh or i trim it up on
the on the
guard level two like once a week and
by the end of the week i'm feeling a
little itchy and that's when i know it's
time to
it's time to move on
a great big bushy beard
he had one thing you don't have oh yeah
what's that
a great bushy beard
every now and then i talk about best
movie theater experiences
a lot come up you know john wick 3 was a
lot of fun
both infinity war and end game were a
great time and glorious bastards
but hot fuzz was up there too only
knowing that i enjoyed
uh sean of the dead and not knowing
anything else about the movie coming in
had a very good time watching that movie
as well
don't what the
django was fun in theaters dude i didn't
see django unchained in theaters
i watched it on
i got invited to a paradox lan party
in sweden weird flex oh you've never
been
my hotel was a boat anyway um
so i i went and i had to fly to
frankfurt first
and it was a long flight i was in the
middle seat
on the 242 configuration i'm not
complaining but you know
like so you're it was me in like seat
three
seat one and two was like a a young
father
uh a young mother and then like their
little baby
and then the baby was like crying up a
storm and they said
we apologize and i hit him back with an
off the cuff
don't worry about it it's a short flight
and then we all laughed
and i was like got him it's ten and a
half hours long um
but then i was watching django unchained
like right next to the
right next to them when they had the kid
on their lap and i was like
i'm not turning it off we're in the air
baby
we could all be going down on a fireball
in like the next hour or something like
that
if your baby's old enough to get in a
you know fiberglass
airfoil they're old enough to like you
know see jamie foxx shoot some dudes in
the
in the dick on a four inch screen you
know
they probably don't remember anyway
yeah it's international waters
what are you gonna do when it's your kid
crying on the airplane you just gotta
like
own it
what are you gonna i mean what do you
think i'm gonna do
be like hey shut up no i'm just you know
you just go sorry and then you move on
with your life
i'll be like hey who brought this baby
here
hey whose baby is this somebody shut
this baby up
well why am i sitting next to this
crying baby that looks like me
that'll work
that'll work dude that's a great get
right there
someone next to me on an airplane was
watching fleabag with
graphic intercourse scenes and
everything dude i'm just here to say
like the airplane is different
the laws are different in the sky
which is definitely like not true
however i'm like you're
you're flying through the air you can
deal with seeing a couple of michael
bubles you know what i mean
i was really well handled on this room
no explain it's like you know you're
you're
flying through the air man that's not a
good explanation it's just more of a
restatement but
i'm like if you if your kid can handle
seeing like an areola
how are they going to feel when the
fuselage snaps in half due to the
extreme turbulence
over the indian ocean and then
we start plunging downwards into an
uncountable spin and the adults that
they normally look to is their support
system and and for comfort are screaming
and like praying and stuff like that
like if you can't handle seeing like
like a little nudity then how are you
gonna deal with
being stuck on a desert island
and like yeah there's some cool stuff
going on like ian somerhalder's there
but then like secondarily hold on i
gotta go to the curse
room uh like two seconds in a lady's not
paying attention and then the jet engine
freaking sucks her in and then explodes
and then it turns out there wasn't an
island at all it was just
a metaphor for like purgatory or
something
how are they gonna deal with that i ask
you
longest loss joke of all time wait till
you hear the joke about the departed
jay did you hear this one were you i
could repeat it ad nauseum if you'd like
is nl a libertarian does this answer
your question
what's next a license to cook toast in
your own damn toaster
personally i think it would be nice if
people had to demonstrate some basic
competency to drive
great video but what does the first guy
say
do you believe there should be driver's
licenses hell no
what's next a license to cook toast in
my own damn toaster
sorry i'm just i'm picturing it frame by
frame
hey hey easy
yes there you go the video is called
gary johnson booed at libertarian debate
for supporting the idea of driver's
licenses
top-notch banter today oh thank you
thank you
no gary johnson is the reasonable one in
the video
by relative standards
what's next a license to fry air in my
own damn air fryer
anyway that's all i got
we're going to the hush fight i'll see
you at the hush fight so you won't be
lonely
see you with the hush fight so you won't
be lonely
two keys huh
two keys
i gotta think this is the thinking man's
play
definitely that sucks left room always
better
bro i don't know just just give it to me
okay and then
this is where true gamers shine
oh no i can't tap fire anymore because
of hemolacria
however what i can do is search for a
crawl space
very very very slowly
just give it a second i know you're like
why would you do this
that's a good point i only have 17
minutes until rocket
rocket league
what if the thanos snap happened in real
life and it affected streamers
50 chance end of my career
50 chance uh
best analytics boost that ever happened
okay i'm gonna take this sack oh that's
true because you wouldn't just get 50
less competition screw it dude i'm not
scared
you would also get 50
less viewers man but dude imagine though
if your joke didn't work you could just
be like that one's for
that one's just for people in the blip
then they'd be like it would be like the
perfect uh
the perfect uh parachute to any bad
joke
guess you guys only got that one if you
were there in the blip
hey man it's not funny a lot of people
died in that blip
they came back spoilers
it's a blip thing baby you wouldn't
understand
please just use bombs okay yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah but these two you can't use
bombs for these this is good
it's too easy but baby yeah
everything that happened on the island
was real and i'm pissed off
jay what do you mean it was not it was
not real
it was a it was a metaphor
it was like oj it was like if it was
real
it was not a metaphor only the last
episode was a metaphor wait really
i've never seen it but i feel like i'm
pretty confident i know everything there
is to know
it's it wasn't a metaphor i was there
half of the last season was a metaphor
the rest was all real
really so like the i thought that they
all died in the plane crash
and then everything that happens on the
island was like
a metaphor for like being ready to let
go
i'm dead please stop dude i do you
telling me that the smoke monster was
real
i thought the smoke monster was like a
metaphor for grief or something like
that
spoilers the smoke monster sat behind me
on the airplane
dude this is blowing my mind i had no
idea
i thought it was all a metaphor dude
i thought that's why people were so
pissed off he and jacob are gods who the
hell is
jacob oh yes the two gods of the lost
mythos
the omnipotent smoke monster and jacob a
guy
with a beard is that the guy who says
the numbers mason
enter the numbers into the console i
need to defeat
the smoke monster that's from quality
black ops all right yeah
yeah keep forgetting that's not a lost
thing that's that's from
that's from call of duty black ops one
my mistake
get me out dude i'm not trying to i'm
not trying to beleaguer the
already beleaguered lost fan base
i'm just sayi i i thought the whole
freaking show was a metaphor man
i didn't know that it actually all that
stuff with like the
others on the other side of the island
was real
and then the only part that was fake was
at the end where they're in the the
church
ask chip maybe chip knows maybe chip
were you there when they were filming it
it's a new zealand thing right
dude i'm amazing at this game
how do you know all this stuff if you've
never seen the show bro i've been around
stop joking about it my mom got killed
by the smoke monster
the smoke monster is not real though you
must be thinking about
jason i mean jacob jacob
wait no jacobs jacob's real yeah yeah my
bad my bad
there's a fun game we could play uh
dan sent me a a tick tock link do we
watch it live on the show
usually when dan sends me a tick tock
link
it's uh it's a video of somebody falling
down
and i laugh every time
it's like somebody like on a skateboard
falling down the stairs or something
like that
i'm not gonna open it though cause like
it's from tiktok so there's like a 95
chance it has like the most popular song
in the world playing in the background
how sick would it be though if it was
ooh papa
dude chip i know you're here like um
somebody linked me on twitter they were
like my girlfriend
is obsessed with ooh papa and then
they had gotten a cake from the grocery
store
and that's the end of the i mean you can
just guess what it says on it
the cake just says ooh papa
kate's been roasting dan's instagram so
hard
definitely true the other day kate was
like hey i'm trying to come up with like
a username that i can use on instagram
and it's gonna be like s-h-i-t
that dan says and i was like you know
i was trying to help her and she shot
down every single one of my
ideas it's like
you know i'm don't hold it against her
it's before i went viral
i guess you can't put like a swear word
in an instagram
username
so she had to get creative he does post
some weird stuff on instagram though i
don't i don't know what's up with
with dan's instagram game
his insta stories have a weird energy
i don't mean like a like an uncomfort
uncomfortable or a disquieting
energy i just mean like you know that
sometimes you just like why did you take
a picture like an empty
cup and then he'll just say something
ridiculous he'll be like you know
cuphead and you're like that doesn't
explain it
at all you've just if anything you've
just given me more questions
so in this business you either know the
cup or you don't know the cup i guess
you don't know the cup and you're like
all right i suppose cracked oar baby
nine lives please do this run
rate of rate of fire
pretty bad we we could have done so much
more if i'd actually just thought to
take like satanic bible first or
something
we could have done a lot better for
ourselves there but
i was just so excited i got it i was so
excited that he stayed on script
spirit heart
hold up a copy of today's newspaper if
this is live all right but all i got is
this wall street journal
is that okay
dude the damage though the damage though
are we getting these cool familiars from
book of the dead because we're on the
dark room like
they're so strong
it happens on shoal too man man oh man
can of corn i would not like to do a
victory lap
dude we're gonna be like on pace this is
crazy
i didn't think it could be done this
this is maybe the highest quality
isaac we've streamed like we we've had
some
some awesome runs today as difficult
characters
like i'm impressed i'm impressed with
myself
why am i doing more well you know
i guess i'm hoping dad's key just drops
new new dad's key just dropped
any progress on trying to get people to
play pub g
pubg will return that's what i'm gonna
say
if you blow yourself up in front of the
door you'll get you'll get into the mega
satan fight
thanks to cracked orb wait hold on what
does cracked orb do
it feels like a debate but we already
got the oh no we didn't get the poster
we do a little oh yeah we'll probably
get it it reveals rooms on the map on
damage
that feels like a heavy bait man but
just give me a minute here okay
but revealing rooms doesn't let me in
it's not bait how do we get in though
it reveals end on locks oh look there
you go why didn't you say that the first
time
would have saved us all this this song
and dance
how do you focus on the game and uh
banter at the same time
the secret is that i don't really
focus on the game most of the time
i would say i pay attention for about
two floors on average
out of the uh out of your
your representative sample of isaac runs
got him and that's okay yeah some
some people some people stand in the
darkness
i'm trying this to uh baywatch theme
song sorry
you guys are ready for that but your
kids are gonna hate it
what was i saying oh yeah what i was
gonna say is this is all just like a
it's the
a long con um for when they eventually
announce
like an esports isaac
uh and then
i have nod leaf oh my god
it actually worked
not bait um
anyway and then when they announce the
isaac racing league
then we uh
then we stop bantering and we become
more powerful than anybody's ever seen
why not buy satanic bible um
because it would give us we would die
picking it up lose a life and then when
we use satanic bible we would have the
exact same amount of life that we have
right now
i think there might be a case to buy
an item if we respawn on the outside of
the room
then that maybe makes a little bit more
sense to me
i mean i think if we if we respawn
on the outside of the room we should
literally just buy
all the items to well yeah
no probably just to get as stacked as
possible
i suppose we could just stand still and
let leech finish the job or uh
yeah nod leaf plus leech
but that's like a coward's gamble
should have done the cowards gamble okay
um why not
lola's hazel oh i mean i'm in baby
little abaddon i mean
it's not a little abaddon at all that's
black powder
i mean to be honest this should be the
kind of run where you're capable of
beating
uh mega satan on one hp
it's just kind of annoying
man if you drop the spirit heart
then we'd be talking that
that would have been nasty that would
have been a bad way to go
you already beat mega stan is this
character yo is that true what the heck
are we doing here
just trying to spawn a void portal just
to
well i guess you know i'm happy we
learned about cracked orb regardless
i can't fight delirium though like i'm
gonna i'm gonna be late man
we get the chest we gotta go through it
i
i i desire above all else to remain
punctual
what's the car dude doesn't justice
force you to take five pills or
something
what the
get toasted
please of
all of my regrets the most regretty
i can't even take it man can't even take
it the most regretty of all
is um
hemolacria i think if we had not taken
hemolacria we'd be in a much better spot
i think i lost my fire no and we don't
have to
we don't actually have to do this this
is this isn't for all the marbles
in fact it's for none of the marbles no
i'm not gonna
leave the game open with nod leaf up
while i play rocket league okay
i get it like it's let's all laugh
because it's a funny idea
and then let's never do it because it's
silly
it's one of those ideas like sausage
party it's better as a concept than it
is as
as a real thing that exists
owned sausage party btfo
you can pretend i did it if you want you
could type plus two
pog my streamer
so true bestie
please then that's what we were missing
dude
we're missing the ultimate lemon party
okay angel statues
we're okay
angel statues we got so much damage
like a couple of a couple of rodden
flies will do it for us
saved saved one more
not today i know those i know those
attacks
raiding the freaking right in the
frickin
right in the visage man hit him right in
the
raiding the jacob
baited get baited
this is our last attempt no matter what
if we die here i'm i'm walking into the
chest
finishing the run
so we we just got to make sure we
succeed
i wish i'm not standing here
you not leave the attacks you're not
confident on
you don't not leave the whole fight if i
come out on top i send it back
exactly
i will have the gaba ghoul
[Laughter]
oh
by the way if you're wondering why i
wouldn't uh
just nod leaf and let angry fly finish
the job i think you're getting a pretty
good
bit of reasoning right here
just chill
just chilling let's go scroll you
the uh we didn't even get the delirium
portal anyway look at that
angry fly finishes the job dude we have
a legit streak going in repentance
what's up with that slash marker so true
bestie great run



okay
no we can't we can't go tainted jacob
yeah it's not the time's not right
let's go tainted keeper i always love
the keeper
what is yankee swap
yankee swap is a um
what's it's like a a a way to do
a group christmas uh oh
um where
trying to think of the best way to
explain this
strange game everybody buys a gift
um for the yankee swap
and then the chain begins somebody
choose the first person to go
chooses a gift from the pile the next
person that gets to go
gets to either choose a gift from the
pile
or they can take a gift from
anybody else who already has a gift and
then the impetus passes to that person
so for example let's say there's uh
10 presents josh goes first
he takes present two mouth has an
option he can either take josh's present
or he could take any present from the
pile
maybe mouth takes present six
so now mouth has six josh has two then
sips gets to go
sips goes oh i actually want present six
then it goes to josh and josh can't get
number six back but he could take mouths
number two
instead or he could take any other
present out of the pile and you just go
until everybody has a present it's like
um
sorry that was really loud us
calls it uh white elephant uh
that's uh surprising because in the us
version of the office they call it
yankee swap
but i white elephant is also not a
descriptive
version of the name so i think we would
have had to explain it no matter
no matter what
yeah at some point you also open them up
and then you know what other people have
like
so in yankee swap in the office they
knew that there
like there was an ipad back when ipads
were still like cutting edge technology
so everyone was like i'll take the ipad
can i have the ipad no you already had
the ipad
okay i guess i'll take the candle
sorry ipod ipod my mistake
it's been a while
okay i'm trying to think what do we need
here hush
dark room
light side really whatever whatever we
want the world's our oyster right now
dude i'm gonna be straight up with you
let's try mr mesix
let's grab peeper's eyeball
let's grab peeper's eyeball
first time first try there's a first try
for everything
yeah there's supposed to be a price
range so that all the gifts are of a
similar value
i don't know yankee swap is kind of
weird man i'm i'm glad that the only
time i ever had to do it in my entire
life was uh
was in sixth grade
see it does seem pretty toxic i guess if
you get a like-minded group it could be
fun
it'd be fun to stream like a uh a yankee
swap
oh baby
but i'll never forget the novelty pencil
man
secret santa's just funny in general i
remember like
so we did secret santa in seventh grade
and eighth grade
and in seventh grade um my secret santa
gave me a box of pot of gold
chocolates which is actually at the time
was pretty sick
no 8th grader should be eating that much
chocolate but
like i had a good time i'm not going to
deny it
i'm willing to take my chances here
maybe we save our money in in
eighth grade this kid gave me a copy
of a dave berry book if you're not
familiar with who dave berry is
he's basically like a uh
the ultimate boomer humorist
and he said like i i said thank you and
he said yeah i don't know my dad says
he's funny
it's kind of like an insult to a
13 year old kid to give him like a
middle-aged dad's
favorite comedian but honestly i read
that book and i was like
he's not wrong he's dave barry guys
pretty funny
i remember he he did a very long bit
about um you know the worst lyrics in
music history you always talk about
macarthur park
what does that even mean someone left my
cake out in the rain
why was it in the rain who put it there
and if it took so long to bake it
why did you put it in the rain i don't
and i was like dude this guy
he's got it all figured out
this is the funniest thing i've ever
read in my entire life never heard the
song
but this mf spinning
exactly exactly uh
sure you know i'll just take just pack
this up in a little box i'll get out of
here
let's go angel deals preserved
if you'll excuse me thank you it's
kidnapping
sticky bandits strike again
dave berry wrote a tv show too wait a
minute is that the show
that the theme song was moving out by
billy joel
i've been trying to recapture that in my
brain for like uh
probably two decades
it is there you you should never argue
with the crazy amendment
you want to know dave's world dude i
i remember way too much about dave's
world
doesn't it start like at the end of the
title screen he's like laying back
on his own roof with his hands behind
his head
that's crazy
who's dave i think it's dave barry man
i think it's dave barry dude
boss rush baby frick yeah
boss rush b boss rush baby boss rush
yeah yeah yeah yeah
anyway that's all i got i'm trying to
think of other secret santas i was a
part of
i did do a secret santa at my uh i
forgot i told this story before but it's
really good i did a secret santa oh you
did boss russia yeah sorry hush yeah
yeah yeah i did secret santa when i
worked in korea
um but i literally started work on
december
1st so i knew nothing about any of my
colleagues right
so i just went to the emart which is
like the korean
walmart and i bought a bunch of instant
coffee
and uh like it was like 50 bucks worth
of instant coffee in a big box
i forget who my my partner was for but i
was like you know hey
uh phoebe teacher here's your uh like
secret santa gift i was your secret
santa hope you like it
and she was like oh thank you this is
awesome and then like
two weeks later i saw the exact same box
on top of the office fridge
and she had just like brought it in and
was like hey if you want one just take
it
it is great
i don't even remember what i received
though so you know i could be worse
would you expect i don't know she'd
drink 50 cups of coffee in front of me
and then be like this is the greatest
gift i've ever received
some sometimes it's not in the cards
though
pog
that's pretty much all i remember though
your gift was so good she wanted to
share with everyone yeah that's probably
like what she was
planning to say if i confronted her um
i mean we'll try to get a charge we
might as well take it
did you ask her to eat the receipt
you like your gift right then let my
wife eat the effing receipt
did someone linked me a video on twitter
of like a
a tc tuggers meetup in san francisco
it was just a bunch of guys like
and it literally was 100 percent
men but just walking down the street
like at each other
maybe it wasn't san francisco but they
had made their own tc
tuggers shirt with a tugger knob and
they were just walking down the street
going like
like sitting in a in a restaurant doing
it was crazy man
i was like oh i guess my invite got lost
in the mail or something
i hope they didn't go on a pub crawl i
mean that's what i was thinking
i was like that better not be a pub
crawl you better just be getting
hammered at this one bar
otherwise you're gonna have some
explaining to do
what is a tc tugger it's the only shirt
with a
tugging knob so that you don't you know
when when it sticks to your belly
you don't have to um you know pinch the
fabric and then it gets like all worn in
that area
base so the real answer to your question
is that it's from the television
program uh i think you should leave and
it's just a shirt with a knob on it
i'm gonna buy this i'm gonna buy this
i don't care about that quite frankly
then i'm gonna use
mr mesix
it's not even one of the best uh
sketches from the show
but it is one of the easiest to remember
no question there
it's just that easy baby
the mind will save your life on hush
uh i think you're talking about the the
soul
but that wasn't the soul that was the
body so i mean
well i sure hope somebody got fired for
that blunder thank you for the raid
daniel thank you
much appreciated
picture thanks for the gifted subs as
well
hello daniel raid blue blade so i had a
not safe for work joke
and it was gonna be said in the this it
popped into my head the same night as
the
well like the same shower as the thanos
joke
um but it said hey did you know michael
buble
is actually a french canadian name yeah
in english it's
he's named in english he's named michael
in english he's named michael mike
michael
so what booblay
you know my kids are
listening hey if you can't pick up
on the social cue of i'm about to say
something vile when i
when i get uncomfortable then that's on
you man
that's on you plus two thank you i
appreciate that
hilarious unironically i think that joke
could work man
that that's the kind of joke jeff ross
could do at the roast of michael buble
if he wants to buy it off me he can have
it all he's got to do is make a tweet
about this
cool galaxy light in exchange
what is up with plus and minus okay so
this is um
plus two minus two these are a reference
to the
variety streamer germa and
the joke is if if a joke is good and
chad approves they'll give it a plus two
and if it's not good they'll give it a
minus two
leads to all sorts of hilarious hijinks
as a result of this
dilemma for example sometimes
satirically
on a good joke chat will say minus two
even though it's the best joke ever made
like that michael buble joke
um just to make the streamer feel bad is
is very funny and everybody's in on a
joke and it's hilarious and
it doesn't hurt anybody's feelings or
anything it's just
normal normal kind of interaction to
have where we're all
making jokes at each other's expense
plus two let's let's go baby plus two
baby
yeah yeah
i'm opening this man what do you got
here
are you gonna get into the new hotness
chivalry 2
um i'll probably play
some when it comes out
uh i played
quite a lot of chivalry one for
subscriber streams back in like
the early 2010s
i i've always found it like a fun
diversion but i got bored
pretty quick you know partly that's like
my fault
because i just literally hold left mouse
button down and like
like i play it like a pyro in in tf2
just w
plus mouse one but
i think for some like turn your brain
off sort of sort of fun
streams yeah maybe like i wouldn't
anticipated
uh being like a mainstay but
all those games like kind of end up
occupying the same
niche for me you know not just uh
mord howe alongside the
chivalry but also like even stuff like
hold fast
like like i don't mean to be insulting
but you know like brainless
64 person battle royales
i uh i play them all the same way and i
think i lose it my
uh they lose my attention quickly as a
result of that which is not their fault
for the record but
yeah we got a couple steam sales now
i think i thought we had two steam sales
half price baby now we can't take both
unless i've got an incredible idea okay
ah do you think it could work
i think i think if you did it at the
right time you might be able to get it
to work
that time it didn't work it just went ah
but i think if you did it right
there's there's a chance
oh golden bomb take these golden bombs
and learn to fly again learn to live so
free
if you hear these golden
bombs these golden bombs will
something something something yeah
oh no a troll bomb anyway um
yeah so that's all i got i haven't seen
any movies is what i was saying
no movies man and then like
i've talked about it before but like hbo
here
also known as crave uh only plays
documentaries that are all named like i
am person's name i am heath ledger i'm i
am cc sabathia i'm greta
thundberg like uh just like at this
point i'm like i get it dude you're john
delorean like i've seen it 20 times
um and then amc's been playing movies
but they've been playing like the same
movies over and over like i'm at the
point where
it's basically just a money ball channel
which is
pretty sick don't get me wrong
but like i've seen money ball and
in various different snippets probably
like 10 times over the past two weeks
i think i'm ready to move on
so i don't know man just thinking maybe
you start watching that
that that young adult show what was what
was what is it called
saw and bones sand and diamonds
bonus shadow and bone shadow that's it
shadow and bone
apparently it's pretty okay i don't know
dude out i hesitate to say i'll watch
anything right now because i think like
that's how you end up finding yourself
getting
lost in cowboy bebop or something but
just finished it is pretty good that's
that's all i need to hear
bro just
just get him i don't want to see
any more greeds okay no more greeds
give me some items to purchase
or 90 day fiance they don't do
90 day fiance anymore the only thing
they play on
tlc is uh seeking sister wife
i don't even know what the heck it is
man by the way
is bear taffy here i got a bone to pick
with him
i listen uh or i was reading wikipedia
last night i was reading about um
because i saw this meme that was like
about
uh you're gonna laugh at me but it's
about brassica
olarisse which is also known as wild
cabbage
uh and how like artificial selection
of that plant is what has led to the
rise of
like that's the origin plant that led to
kale
cabbage brussels sprouts uh
kohlrabi like it just selecting for
different
cauliflower and broccoli like just
respecting or
uh selecting for different aspects
of the uh plant led to all those
vegetables
which is really cool and then i was on
like a wikipedia
um i don't know like a rabbit hole after
that
and i was reading about chicory and
about how like when there's been
coffee shortages historically chicory is
like
something that tastes like coffee even
though it's not caffeinated
and then i read a little deeper
and they were talking about whether or
not like you can drink
coffee if you're a mormon and apparently
uh like i had no idea about and this
could be wrong
but apparently the church of latter-day
saints
says in order to be a good mormon you
should not consume
hot beverages
i had no i i learned so many new things
last night
i apparently at least according to the
this
the strictest read of the
of joseph smith's book of mormon um you
you're you're not allowed
to consume hot drinks
what about iced coffee it is one of the
infinity stones
i can't look i'm in the middle of i'm in
the middle of something
okay very solid fight very solid
i keep dodging my own eyeball too i
apologize
okay i mean this dude is worth taking
it's worth a look
let's go
there's a whole circular thing where
like caffeine
is not okay but if it's in soda it's
okay because soda is technically
not brewed all right dude i mean again
i'm not trying to
i get most i guess faiths have some kind
of strict
rules of that that seem a little bit
arbitrary in the modern uh
day especially but no hot drinks is one
that i had never heard before so it
it took me by surprise
because i'm like you're gonna tell me
that you know if i went to like a
you know mormon sunday school i wouldn't
see half the kids there
drinking monster energies
i don't think so
bear is he is no longer mormon but he
grew up in the faith
i think i'd rather have this
it's not just caffeine though like
because people are saying not all hot
drinks have caffeine
what i read at least was like is
literally the temperature of the
beverage
hot drinks is from 1838 the recent patch
says
no caffeinated beverages okay fair
enough
it's you know i am uh
faithless like like an elector and uh
this kind of stuff is just interesting
to me the idea of uh
of a religion that modifies itself in
response to modern times it's very
interesting
they do big patches twice a year so this
is like i'm gonna use this as an
opportunity to go back and talk about
how we should
revisit that twice a year like for
example victoria day
oh no here we go but we don't need
to call it victoria day anymore
sorry i'm just i'm just joe it's a call
back to yesterday i apologize
that's all i got don't yes i've i've
consulted the notebook don't talk about
christopher columbus
christopher columbus it turns out you do
not under
any circumstances have to hand it to him
i was not paying attention
not like this dude
i was glancing
[Laughter]
i was glancing on the first shot i'm
just gonna be honest
on the subsequent shot i don't even know
what hit us actually i think on the
first one we just walked into a rock
i hate the the tint they're not tinted
rocks i hate the spike rocks man
i feel like the hitbox is like it's
either
too good or too bad
that's what you get for talking about
columbus
going offline guys okay sprinklers
i'm gonna become the joker yeah mom's
key mom's key that's the ticket
here farm it up baby farm it up be more
aggro
be aggressive
nice buy dude just you wait you're gonna
be ashamed
when i use my um
when i use this bomb that i purchased to
get to the secret room and the secret
room has an infinite supply of money
you're gonna be embarrassed man
i wanted it i wanted it
the heck is that emote it's a joker
emote
imagine rock bottom in the secret room
dude imagine
going to the restaurant rock bottom
it's kind of a cool place
i have me too i've been to i've been to
two of them
one in seattle and one in uh
the minneapolis-st paul airport
would i recommend it if you're in
seattle
i mean you need a nice like place for
lunch that's not gonna rile up any picky
eaters
sure why not if you're in the
minneapolis-st paul
airport absolutely you should go to it
because i mean like it's an airport
any place at an airport where you can
get half decent food
and like a couple of beers highly
recommend it
what if you're sleepless in seattle well
just go down lay down close your eyes
dummy
you don't have to do something crazy
like make like a whole movie about it or
whatever
donkey donkey donkey okay that's blood
blood of the marty blood of the marty's
pretty good
i was named after that movie what's your
name tom hanks
it's just the joke doesn't even make
sense
it's literally like inconsequent doesn't
it what
what's your name meg ryan
bumpy
what's your favorite mid-range beard
okay so i
i don't know the answer to that question
um
but i will i will give you my thought
process okay
i i have no idea how this works by the
way um
always look to see if there is a
stout on the menu
i have a i have a predilection towards
stouts
if i don't see a stout 97.5
chance there will be some kind of weirdo
ipa
i'll give that a try if for some reason
they don't have it
then we're getting into some you know
the the
the kind of beer i do not want to ever
pay restaurant prices for
is a lager i i don't need to consume
any more lagers over the course of the
rest of my existence
i'm just kind of done with them you know
i had my college experience and
and it's you know that's in the past now
pilsner is pretty close to the bottom as
well i like an
ales sometimes like an ale with a little
bitterness to it i got nothing against
the sour
i i can get down with the half of icing
but but a lager is close to the bottom
of the list i will pay
donkey donkey
so people are saying like sours give
them heartburn i've also heard that a
lot from like people who have
uh they have an issue with sparkling
water they say like oh
i i want to like it but it gives me
heartburn can i ask an honest question
i don't think i know what heartburn is
because what i was originally going to
say is i don't think i've ever
experienced it
but i can't that can't possibly be true
what does heartburn feel like i miss the
the class on this
it's acid reflux okay what does acid
reflux feel like
feels like stomach acid coming out of
your throat
like when you throw up in your mouth a
little bit
it's a burning in your chest
little baby barth baby barf okay
i think i got to stop drinking sparkling
water
that's not nor no i'm joking
gotcha
donkey donkey this is a this is a decent
run right here
you feel like you need to burp it up but
you can't
all right you know what maybe i haven't
really i mean i think i've encountered
a similar symptom before in my life but
certainly not with regularity
but i'm definitely like i'm not saying
i'm immune to it
because i already went through that as a
as a younger man having many discussions
about like
i don't why do people say like when they
eat taco bell their colon explodes
sounds like they just have a weak colon
to me and then now like
if i eat spicy food and then in the
morning i'm like
why why does my you know what hurt and
i'm like oh right
yeah the vindaloo it'll it'll catch up
to you at some point probably
just uh you know with with age comes
wisdom
maybe the wisdom to order like a lamb
madras instead of the lamb vindaloo
food poisoning part two no no no no no
no no
no no no
let me back i want to go back
vindaloo is the mad cats of food what
does that even mean man
what does that even mean
is mad cats good now i
because when i was a i like and i'm not
suggesting that
it is but i thought people had told me
that madcatz has a good reputation now
when i was a when i was a child you
would always buy mad cats controllers
because they were like five bucks
cheaper than the official ones but then
they would crap out on you real quick
to have like a weird like analog dead
dead zone or something like that
the fight sticks are good okay
secret room
secret room
i only bought the memory cards was it
the one that i always talk about where
you had to
uh you had to spin up
the playstation and then hot swap the
disc to the proprietary memory card
software
honestly i'm saving my money i think i
learned a valuable lesson here
we don't need this it's not worth it
is it is a different era man planetarium
four two four jupiter you're a gas giant
i do be huge
i do be large and and dare i say in
charge as well
me after quarantine ends
is this what cisco meant when he said
she got dumps like a truck
if you don't move you build up farts
okay
okay guys like what
what what dumps like a truck
i think i'll sing it again
build it up baby build it up
incredible great great sound too i'm
eating
i want the dime thank you
pre-deodorant isaac don't even get me
started sir you made a joke at michael
buble's expense
he's received the order of canada we're
taking you away for a long time
we're taking you away for life
i love burger king but it makes my heart
hurt
oh i love burger king it makes my heart
sing
you know what i mean vern
soul of azazel i know what this does
i saw it in a run earlier today
if you haven't seen it i'm not gonna
spoil it for you i'll leave that up to
chat instead
um but trust me it's
it's got some good it's not worth
saving for a full floor
well
i guess if you had like a one because of
our trinket
technically we could but i'm not gonna
i'm just gonna use it
because it's burning a hole in my pocket
stapler red stew
red stew do the damage up from this
though
nice try that's the soul of his hazel
baby
that's the soul of his hazel
maybe not the best use of it but
[Laughter]
that's red stew baby red stew a little
overkill
there's a new show on discovery plus is
about a man who does laundry well
it's called the laundry guy
you know you really gotta hand it to
them
they're they're scraping the bottom of
the barrel so hard you can taste oak
i saw an ad for the laundry guy at least
it's not as
disgusting as like you know dr pimple
pop or
like my feet are killing me and stuff
like that
my feet are killing me like even i
sometimes have a hard time
watching it like
people like i have to wear one size 8
shoe and then like one
size 16 shoe and the doctor's always
like why didn't you
like come to the doctor to get it fixed
and then he's like lady
because it's expensive
i'm only here because tv's paying for it
if tlc was in foot in the bill i'd still
be
i'd still be on crutches right now
um yes please
okay uh like i'm curved horn
for sure luda's kind of interesting
though
footing the bill
footing implying
i don't think i'm gonna take luda
i do love that my flies apparently just
don't hit enemies
and i'm not even being facetious like i
i like having them
i'm glad they're sticking around i guess
we're killing things too fast because of
red stew
that makes sense what's your favorite
type of burger
dude i kind of agree with mouth i think
i should become a slider main
because i've gone on a record many times
being like i don't like the
the huge burgers
oh my god i like the uh
i like the smaller burgers that are a
little neater
but the the flip side of that is like
i've never ordered sliders because i've
always been like three hamburgers what
are you you know the
queen of england
oh your majesty can't can't just have
one hamburger i guess here's
sure here's three little hamburgers for
you
you're always like that you sound just
like that that's what i'm saying
man that's what i'm saying
but i've never had a slider oh
we need the money
you big in a white castle then do i've
never eaten there i've never had a
chance
well i've i guess i've eaten in uh i've
been in las vegas and seen a white
castle but i've never eaten that one
plus we gotta make i gotta get down
there fast before joe biden makes it
illegal to eat hamburgers right
give me ludo okay it'll it'll be fun so
true bestie
dude i think we just our tear is warren
buffett's brain
that's crazy so true
sell me on sliders no i've never eaten
one
so like i'm not gonna try to sell you on
them it would be dishonest
but if i if i get to try a slider at
some point and i enjoy them
then i will extol the virtues of the
slider
for now i've never i've never had a
chance
sell me on air fryers no we've been
through this i don't know who you are
if i know who if if you're like if sips
goes hey
explain what an air fryer is i'll tell
them
but i i my new my half year resolution
is uh don't argue with strangers
about anything like literally about
anything
important things on important things
no doesn't matter
if you don't you know respect the
testimonial of the air fryer
then i got a website for you it's called
commonsensemedia.com
i think you'll find some reviews there
that'll speak to you

pay for the finger i don't think it's
that bad

upgrade
are you a fan of john is this just an
elaborate bit to ask me how i feel about

chat asking how i feel about the 2007

how did they get david bowie to be
in um zoolander
no you know what scratch that line of
reasoning i think if i were david bowie
and ben stiller was like hey do you want
to play yourself in a silly movie
for like five seconds and you'll get
paid for it
i don't i've decided i don't wanna it's
not worth the risk
he was a big fan of blue steel
uh how would he know though because wait
no blue steel is the
you're right okay my mistake magnum is
the one that he had to work on
it's completely different
pheromones fair amounts
i don't know i mean dude honestly like
if you had the choice
let's if i put myself in the shoes of
david bowie
and i had either the option to cameo in
like an adam sandler
uh film or
like a david fincher movie i would
definitely do the adam sandler film
because i feel like that would just be
like a fun time at the sandals resort
in cancun whereas david fincher would be
like again
again please please mr fincher i'm
i'm very hungry can we just take like a
quick snack break so i can eat a granola
bar
again that was good now do it better
come on come on man
i don't know that much about david
fincher except that i like his movies
and
also i know that he and ben affleck
had a dispute uh
because in gone girl david fincher
wanted
noted bostonian ben affleck to wear a
new york yankees hat
and ben affleck said under no
circumstances am i going to do that
because he will be mocked forever by the
boston crowd
and it became like they had the shutdown
production on the set of gone girl
for literally like a day i think
and then i think what they did is they i
they didn't want to solo okay chaos is
way better
obviously but soul of his hazel's great
to take with us
um i think what they did in the end is
either they gave him a yankees hat and
then in post
they like airbrushed out the logo
or alternatively they
gave him a yankees hat to wear and then
in post
they edited out the yankees logo like or
he no you're right he wore a mets hat
yeah my mistake
my mistake i was just completely off
um my bit rate anyway great story
might want to fact check it when i bring
it up clearly i don't remember it too
well
oops
soul of the keeper has appeared in the
basement
did i throw that oh jeez almost went
straight down hmm hum
double double toilet trouble cauldron
bacon
cauldron bubble chaos card and soul of
horn butt of
fart and tear of scorn
stop farting dude okay um
i mean like we could try delirium like
this is a pretty good run
to try delirium that's something i would
like to knock off the post-it note
i would we'll do the dark room with this
character many times in history i'm sure
um to have the chance
to do delirium would is is much more
difficult
much more bespoke and i think the soul
of azazel is going to help us out a
great deal
but we could still pretty easily lose i
don't know if anything will generate
coins for us
on
on the delirium fight in case we take
damage probably so
there's probably some variants of bosses
that would do it
head of the keeper will generate coins
how about that can of corn
head of the keeper can of corn for a
dollar name a can
hey here's a question for you can you
buy
non-frozen peas
what the
you know what i mean
um we've killed the boss
like can can you buy non-frozen peas
that are out of the pod
i guess is what i'm trying to say
i know they're not frozen in the ground
but i mean like i've never been in the
grocery store and been like oh there's a
big
bin full of like you know
peas
you all you if you want them you know d
potted like like ben affleck
watching the departed um then you you
gotta you gotta buy them in their frozen
form right
that's a great bit man ben affleck
asking for non-frozen peas at the
grocery store
no i want them depotted what
mr affleck what are you talk the
departed
the departed the movie mr affleck
i want the peace departed
it's like hold on it's it's still coming
to me
how am i i'm supposed to depod my own
peas what am i supposed to do feed them
 and keep them in the dark
that's mushrooms mr affleck that's
mushrooms
they also come in cans actually i saw
the departed
at the cairns film festival is that what
you're talking
no that's khan that's khan
that's star trek i just want departed
peas
please
anyway um plus one and a half i'll take
it
stay close to the coins
the closer you are to savior the further
you are from harm man
minus float infinity hey come on
like the bit wasn't that good but i
don't know if it's
worthy of minus the maximum
number that a computer can generate with
64 bits
like
it's a little rude it was worse than not
good
malf would laugh i think malf would
laugh just at the concept
hey mouth want to hear my impression of
ben affleck trying to order
depotted peas at the grocery store
no i want to pees the body
it's i don't know man it's pretty good
so was this run by the way we made it
happen look at this
look at that fun run all this during a
delirium fight
you love to see it keeper's kin has been
unlocked all right great run love you
youtube
now you can go to bed
tainted keeper



tainted lazarus would you believe it
did you believe it
you don't believe it do you check it out
guess what
tainted lazarus what the heck between
life and death flip
three hp two boots and two swords
i don't know how this character works
but we're gonna figure it out okay
you've got the ohm wrecker sigil in the
bottom right
it has a six-room charge
uh-oh oh you got you you flipped from
light side to dark side okay
dark side is i mean that's pretty
sizable damage no question
this character sucks he's the worst
character
i hate this character he's bad okay
that's fun
that's cool glad to hear it
[Laughter]
back back to tainted jacob grinding it
is
so the items do not carry over that's
what i'm realizing here
so
i mean okay here's i'm
i'm making a mistake already because i'm
trying to like game the system instead
of just playing the game
like at the end of the day if you can
just dodge you're gonna solve like a lot
of problems right
oh you change every room oh
now i i was like we'll just build one
character and then not worry about it
how foolish i was okay um
okay well it's very simple we'll just
get mom's knife as one character and
then brimstone is the other and then
easywin forehead
have you noticed how cursed the the
streamer runs of uh jacob and esau have
been
simvicta told me today he had a run
as jacob and esau where
he fought delirium and the delirium
fight alone was an hour long
i was like i i didn't think that
it was possible to have a worse jacob
and esau run than we did
against delirium where the run was 90
minutes long
and then um about 45 minutes of that was
on the void
but like an hour of of trying to fight
specifically just that boss
i would i might uninstall quite frankly
oh it depends why yeah was it
was it orbital nod leaf or was it was it
constant activity there's there's a
[Laughter]
difference
new chib emote by the way is that what
is that like a baby
baby cow
that's a cute it's a cute item um
so i don't i think i want to flip and
then take this as you
maybe maybe you can hold real hp you can
okay
what this character is supposed to be
hard
easy
okay don't throw any hp away
don't throw any hp away take me down to
the next floor and we're gonna try to
finesse
some deals with the angel
i i see some people saying hey it's not
um you know it's tainted uh tainted
it's jacob and esau but worse i don't
know man like the thing is
like the problem with jacob and esau is
not the division of items
the problem is trying to dodge with two
individuals in a game that
like if we're being honest was just
designed to dodge with one
uh so the fact that at least you're only
playing as one character is kind of uh
it's kind of poged if i dare say so
myself
but certainly the deciding what item
goes to who is kind of
is a little touchy
it's definitely also the division of
items well i wouldn't know because i
always go to the alt path because i'm
not scared
uh and as a result of not being scared i
get two items anyway
so it's not that big of a deal for me
but if you're like the average isaac
player
or um or worse i suppose
um then you uh i could understand that
you would find yourself in times of
trouble mother mary comfort me
now that your tweets viral have you
gotten any requests
to promote galaxy lights or
that vibrator with the suction cup on
the
on the top of it for whatever reason
um i i have not
i've heard and like it's just insane to
me but
i have heard that um
the rate that you get for
advertising those galaxy lights
is literally 50 dollars per viral tweet
which is so unbelievably like
it's so low i can't even describe it
like i i can look at the analytics for
that thanos tweet
i'm pretty sure it has um at this point
it's got 18
000 likes it's probably been seen by 500
000 people so literally you're paying
like
point one cent per view which is
like unfathomably it's just an insult
um
so i'm not going to sell you out for 50
bucks if somebody
would like to pay maybe shall we say
2500 then we might start to think about
it
but but 50 bucks for a galaxy light no i
don't i don't believe that that will be
happening
i i will maintain my integrity in the
face of uh in the face of that offer
dude honestly i'm just going down to the
next floor we don't even want to see it
because we're getting deals with the
angel in the future
i don't want to see it
that being said i'm i think it's one of
those like oro boros things
where like one of the reasons that they
pay so little for the advertisement is
because the the advertisement
doesn't work at all so they can't afford
to pay more for the advertisement
something like that i'm curious what the
light is
it's just like it's it's a lamp that
projects
like stars onto your ceiling basically
and then there's another one that's like
you won't believe
uh what you get up to when you got this
lamp and this
the lamp looks like a sunset
and then there's like um and there's
another one that's like put your
favorite album cover in glass
and it's like a 3d glass sculpture of
you know
goblin by tyler the creator
have you ever bought something based on
a tv commercial
um definitely like as a child there's no
question
i mean when you're a kid like when you
see an ad for something like it it just
it hits a part of your brain that like
you have no rational protection against
until you're an adult right
like as a kid i was i mean
every time i saw the crossfire
commercial they made it seem like the
best game of all time
i didn't get to play it as an adult
until um
or until i was an adult i should say it
was probably like in in university and
it's like the game just kind of sucks
it's like like messy pong but uh
the the ad was incredible
and i mean serials you know what the
other one that got me for sure
was the board game 13 dead end drive i
remember having like such hype for 13
dead end drive
because it looks so cool in the ad like
there's an old man walking and then he
steps on like a pressure plate
in front of the grandfather clock and
the clock like spins around
and sucks him into the wall and you're
like oh hell yeah
then when you play it yourself like 13
dead end drive was like
it was okay but it was one of those
games that had like absurd
setup time and then it was kind of like
mousetrap where the traps never went off
properly so
you know like my mom's character would
step on
the pressure plate and then i'd push the
button uh
but like it wouldn't actually suck the
the board game piece like away so you
just had to like manually remove it from
the board and you're like okay
well i kind of bought it because there
was a cool 3d ad
of your soul getting snatched but i
guess instead just uh
you take damage you take two damage
yeah this is tainted lazarus right now
you know it was a sick game was um don't
break the ice
the game with the plastic ice cubes and
then you got the little hammer and it's
like horizontal jenga
that game was sick man
you ever played kerplunk there's
actually nothing to think about there's
a lot of great
kids board games kerplunk is the game
with the marbles
in a tube and then you get like the the
straw
or not straws but like little plastic uh
spikes that you like pull out of the
sticks is a much better word thank you
little plastic sticks you pull out to
try to like make as few marbles drop as
possible
great game and then you ever play um oh
i think this might be like a canadian
game it's called
rebound but it basically
you had like little ball bearings with
plastic
edges on them and then the board was
like
a long path
and then elastic bands that made like
ricochet corners
it was like like micro shuffle board but
you had to
flick the rebound things and bounce them
off the elastic
bands oh man that was that was a great
game
now we're talking now we're talking
yeah kind of like cool shuffleboard or
the kids shuffleboard
hungry hungry hippos hungry hungry
hippos is okay but like i don't
i don't love a game that has like
literally no strategy
like you literally are like just mashing
and
then sometimes like the least satisfying
feeling of all time
is when the hippo gets like a ball stuck
in the corner of their mouth and then
it won't like open and close properly
for five seconds
your cousin's just mashing and gobbling
up the balls like
a lot of those games are like you know
the the more physics driven that they
were
the less likely that they were actually
going to work well
but there's some classic physics driven
board games for kids we got so
lucky yes please
i mean here's what i'm thinking okay
let's
let's try to get the items split
somewhat evenly
so i'm gonna put this on you now and i'm
gonna blow you up
something fierce let's see if this works
man
kind of let's try to get the items split
somewhat evenly
trouble was pretty good you know
okay so trouble was the one that in the
center of the board you had like the the
plastic
dome that you pushed on to roll the dice
right that was pretty fun
um i'm trying to think of what the uh
the other oh i was thinking of
frustration you ever do frustration
it was the one where like you had to put
the shapes in the right spot
there were like probably 36 shapes you
had to put in the right spot uh
and if you took too long like because
the board would go tick tick tick tick
tick o perfection
yeah that's perfection not uh not
frustration sorry
and you'd you'd be and the board would
like it'd start at the bottom and then
it would rise and it would go tick tick
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
tick tick and you're like
where's the where's the the the half
moon where do i put the half moon tick
tick tick tick tick tick and if you
didn't put it in in time
it would uh it would explode on you and
like pop all the pieces out like
kazumaru cheese
that's right in the square hole that was
a great game
thank god you started streaming i can
only focus when you play isaac
dude you know what feel free to take the
thanos meme and just replace
the the thumb infinity stone with new
isaac episode
that i i give you my permission
okay we're good we're good
yeah that is the maggot cheese there
were a lot of games as a kid i was
really bad at dude
like um i'm
horrible at operation even as a child
like i don't think i have like a
neurological
problem to be wary about but as a child
even i had like kind of
shaky uneven hands like i would never be
a good barber
so operation is like a disaster for me
and then also um that game where you
gotta like it's similar to operation but
you get like a metal hoop
and you have to run it uh over a metal
rod
so that it never touches the rod or goes
that one as well never and plus i'm
impatient too
i like doing is slow i'm like that's for
the birds man no thank you
that game is on neopets now
pog i don't really know what neopets is
honestly it's like
online tamagotchi meets pokemon right
that was one that was just i'm not gonna
say it was after my time but i think
just like my school never got into it
my wife just looked at the title of the
stream and chortled
the balding of isaac because he's bald
she's she's got it
let her know she's got it 100 correct
the joke has been solved
the joke explainer has logged on and
honestly
she she gets the subtext as well
you know what i'm oh i didn't mean to
switch
i didn't mean this i meant to put down
the tnt
dude okay put down the tnt
oh instead of binding cj you get it now
joe stepping to the plate joe random
the best way to keep the batter off a
step is to pound them hard inside
it's have you have you have you
encountered that uh during the show
jay i forget the exactly uh not lyric
but the line that the
the con the commentary says but he's
like if you want to keep this batter off
balance you got to keep pounding them
low and inside
and they're like come on man come on you
know what you were saying
when you do that's not a baseball line
what are your thoughts on the movie the
prestige
uh great movie
when i uh was
in university it was maybe my second
year of university
both the prestige and the illusionist
came out
i trusted the critics at the time who
said the prestige is
fun but the the movie for
like real mature cinema goers is the
illusionist
i went to see the illusionist in
theaters this this birthed like a
an evergreen meme um where i talked
about
how like i had to pee for the entire
second half of the movie but they just
kept revealing like twist after twist
and my bladder was like on the verge of
exploding but the end of the movie is
like paul giamatti
slowly piecing together like everything
that happened and he just keeps like
having this this dumb struck face of
realization while the camera spins
around i'm just going
delightful like over and over and i was
just dying in my seat like please
paul i got i'm gonna die
dude i'm gonna my bladder's gonna
explode man
um but anyway only saw the illusionist
or sorry the prestige many years later
um and honestly
uh definitely feel like the prestige is
a better movie
but they are both uh they're both
at least good the prestige
probably takes it a level beyond that
for me
they're both fun movies no doubt about
that
what are your thoughts on mortal kombat
2021 my thoughts are like i wanna i'm
angry at hbo
for the fact that like i i had to ask
chat
how to watch it and they're like oh just
watch it on hbo max and then i had to
ask chat
how you watch hbo max in canada and
canadians were like oh it doesn't exist
so like the only way this is scary but
the only way that i think you can watch
mortal kombat 2021 in canada right now
is to pay 25
for a rental digitally and there's just
absolutely no way that's gonna happen
i think we swap grab this
grab that we have not been to our item
room yet either
it's okay i'm not scared because check
this out
[Laughter]
genius okay you know just to
not have to walk through some rooms with
spikes i'm willing to do this
and then let's just see let's just see
what we get okay fair enough
shot speed down not what i was hoping
for
not what i was hoping for i'm in canada
i paid 25 bucks to watch on amazon prime
i had fun but i don't recommend it i i
hear you i mean it's just like this a
lot man
like i don't mind paying like i'll level
with you you can call me like
the the element that's ruining the
cinema industry if you want
i'm probably gonna pay 30 bucks to watch
black widow on disney plus it looks
i'm sorry i almost choked on my words uh
the premise
didn't really interest me that much that
much when i watched the trailer i was
like you know what the trailer is pretty
pogged you got me
and i'll watch you with kate so it's
like 15 15 right
mortal kombat she is not gonna watch um
with me so i am not gonna uh
pay 25 dollars just to watch it myself
like that's just a an extreme
basically flushing the money down the
toilet like that's that's a movie i'd
probably just look at my phone
the entire time so i i really need to
wait for that one to
come out on a service i already pay for
or alternatively
like at least not be 25
either one would would interest me i
think
donkey dunk
oh yeah and um that's the other thing is
like i'm i'm kind of like a captive
audience right now we're not going to be
able to go to the movie theater for like
a long time
uh because of the baby right
so it's a lot easier to get me to pay
30 bucks to see like a prestige movie at
home
not the prestige that one i could
probably see for free now but
i'll pay uh i'll pay a little extra for
the privilege but it's got to be the
right thing
it's got to be the right time
did you see the oscars i did not um
i was gonna make it this was before my
viral tweet last night i was gonna make
um
i was gonna make a tweet about stop
asking me if i'm watching the oscars i
only saw three movies in 2020
but then i was like i don't i think it's
going to take away from the virality of
my
my banger thanos tweets so
i just uh i opted out instead
okay we gotta we got a game plan here
like i have literally no
opinion on i lived on what happened in
the oscars this year
except i saw uh
daniel kaluuya win excuse me my justice
card
my justice card i saw daniel kaluuya say
life's amazing my mom and my dad met
they had sex and here i am and then i i
saw
a just an absolutely terrible interview
with him afterwards
where the reporter was like so wow you
really um you really went for it there
on stage with the uh
funny comment destined to live in oscar
history right and
he was just you know kind of like i
don't know what you're talking about
like i
think it's kind of like common knowledge
that all of our parents had intercourse
it was uh it was just a weird energy
interview
then i did see one person reply to the
tweet that showed the interview
and um their their tweet was like you
know i watched this show with my kids
and now they're asking me all sorts of
uncomfortable questions
okay sorry like
bro i mean here's the question why are
you watching the oscars
like with a young child they're going to
be bored out of their skull
you know well did your kids see nomad
land
i doubt it they're not going to
appreciate its mature themes and
you know it's meditations on what it
means to be uh
a member of uh american society at the
fringes of economic survival
you know they're they're eight years old
you don't need to watch the oscars with
your with your second grader
i watched the oscars with my son
aged five and he said father
i hope anthony hopkins i hope sir
anthony hopkins wins
best actor did you know his portrayal
as hannibal lecter
is the shortest amount of screen time in
a movie in history that went on to win
best supporting actor
i just love sir anthony hopkins
anyway that's all i got
i can't even tell actors apart you can
you can tell anthony hopkins a party
he's old and he looks like hannibal
lecter
no no no no no no no
this is scary
yeah he's an old guy wait i had
something to say but i forgot it
i don't remember it now whatever moving
on
couldn't have been that important don't
hit me dude
i'm like what button do you press what
button do you press
anyway the oscars how about that
love to see him love to see him i did
see i love when
the movie that i've seen wins an award
uh soul won best animated feature
congrats to me for choosing to watch a
pixar movie
good choice why not do freaking why not
dude yeah mads mikkelsen his movie won
an award last night too i looked up the
synopsis
it's called another round it's about um
four friends who
decide to experiment to see if their
life would be better if they maintained
a constant
blood alcohol concentration of 0.05
um seems like a fun movie that i'm sure
has no negative consequences as a result
of that
seems kind of like the hangover right if
you like the hangover
you'll also like another round
a rip-roaring romp about middle-aged men
behaving badly with no consequences
whatsoever
he looks like hannibal too bro they
might as well have just called it like
you know the hannibal's last night
what did the horrible joke
just a just a terrible joke and now in
my head i can't get
um the phrase outs
i deserved it i mean we we had nothing
man we had nothing on that run
whatsoever
um so i don't offer any apologies like
we should have died
faster quite frankly um
now i can't get the phrase out of my
head and now hannibal lecter steps to
the lectern
to give a lecture i don't know that
should be like a uh
that should be like an english as a
second language oral exam question
hannibal lecter steps to the lectern to
give a lecture
okay eminem tunable victor step to the
left turn
to give a lecture you remember mosh
not smosh but the the song mosh by
eminem
whatever happened to that guy
did you know mosh look i'm not a hip hop
expert i was reading about mosh last
night though i was alive when it came
out
oh farticus thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
thank you um i was reading about mosh
last night
um not mosh potatoes no but did you know
that
complex magazine named it the 58th best
hip hop song of all time
seems like i'm not the only one that
doesn't know anything about hip hop
i don't even think it's the in the top
58 eminem songs
go look it up maybe it's not i think
it's complex
why not why not
dunk dunk donkey donkey
dunk dunk
probably was not sean evans
decision is my guess
that song is seeds here i mean do like
you gotta remember like 2004 was kind of
a different time
you know jimmy kimmel was not
interviewing uh president george w
bush in running his fingers through his
hair and asking him about what it means
to be a painter
he was instead on the man show at the
time
drinking an enormous stein of beer and
then throwing to the outro
of young girls bouncing up and down on a
trampoline in bikinis
it was a different era
mid-2000s you eminem could make a song
like mosh
nowadays i don't know i don't know if
people can handle it it's a little
political
uh okay down to the next floor
donkey donkey
what is awfully hot coffee pot
anytime i reference eminem i guess i can
fill in the blanks for myself
but anytime i reference eminem
that comment shows up in chat it's an
awfully hot
coffee pot
that's a real line he did i thought it
was like
i thought it was like somebody doing an
impression of him
he actually says it in the
in the freestyle no
no no no
that's good stuff that's i gotta watch
that
i did i did see the the trump discs that
he made it's from that i don't remember
that's the oh yeah okay the one where
it's in the it's in black and white
because it's serious yeah
i mean it was serious but it's also
seriously funny
if you said that's an awfully hot coffee
pot
the other thing i was reading about mosh
i was laughing because they were like
you know some of the reviews of the song
were like if this is the last song
eminem ever makes then at least he went
out with a bang
and i'm like i mean i guess in 2004
you could maybe be like maybe this is
the end of his career
but reading that in 2021 is just
hilarious
you're like what do you mean it's a if
it's the last thing eminem ever makes
17 years later he's still making music
aged like milk i got nothing against
eminem by the way like
you know i i never had like a huge
eminem phase
uh like a lot of people did uh in the
early 2000s but
you know you couldn't escape lose
yourself you couldn't escape
stan you know he had an enormous
cultural impact
in my generation for sure
so true bestie hey but it actually is so
true
but honestly like i didn't buy a rap
album probably until i was like 22.
[Laughter]
no maybe like maybe like 16 or 17. okay
we shouldn't have even gone in there
that's my bed
i would go over to my friend's house and
and he would just play um
we ain't go win nowhere
we ain't going nowhere cause we're bad
boys like over and over that that was
all i needed
i would like to flap
and then get out of here
i don't know am i am i stupid to think
this run stands a chance right now it
doesn't seem that bad
i bought a limp biscuit record off a
friend because i wasn't allowed to own
it
i maybe it's a generational thing right
the idea of not being allowed to own
music is so funny to me
like the entire concept of like parents
in the 1970s and the 1980s being like
you're not allowed to listen to kiss is
hilarious
you're like
you know i'd listen to kiss you know
that like
is this is that an x-man no that's
an x it kiss is like sure
they they they paint their faces and
they like you know
stick their tongue out and stuff like
that but like if you ever listen to
their music it's not that edgy
you know strutter
that's what's wrong with gotta lose your
mind i don't support losing your mind
in detroit rock city or elsewhere
it's just it's so tame by like modern
standards right
what about love gun i mean like here's
my thing okay
so love gun is obviously you know
everybody knows what
he means when he says nowhere to hide
baby
nowhere to run you pull the trigger on
my dunk of the dunk dunkity dunk dunkity
dunkity dunk
love gun like you know what he's talking
about
but at the same time when paul mccartney
says
i want to hold your hand
i'm going to take that with our other
character you know he's not
he doesn't really care that much about
holding her hand
you don't get that much out of it you
know he's talking about his love gun
it's just a question of like you know
what so and honestly like
some pop songs are like
more offensive almost with the way that
they
allude to mature themes
versus like you know in some rock songs
or hip-hop they'll just say it but like
i mean the classic example and i do want
to point out growing up in canada
this is something that came up way
before h3h3 figured it out
uh but the before four song that says
you know
we're gonna make you come tonight
over to my house like that was evil
you're watching that as like a 12 year
old on much music
and you're like i know what he's saying
you're not getting away with anything
right
if you go down on me i'll oh no if you
get down on me i'll get down on you
it's a game of give and take to make it
through
we're free we're free
i'd rather they just say it then allude
to it you know
like when when mandy morris says like
you know
i'm waiting for you i'm missing you like
candy
come on we know what she's talking about
or what the the swedish songwriter who
originally came up with the song was
writing about in the first place
anyway that's
subscribe to my podcast for more takes
like this
don't hit me
i'd say most songs in in one way or the
other
i mean there's only really like five
songs you know
if you break them down into distinct and
discreet themes
there's like you know
death subcategory getting old
love and intercourse uh the subgenre of
songs that are
uh weird flex but okay you know the song
is like that you know i'm so cool
and that's about it the songs about
being a singer
is is another one and i think that
pretty much covers like 99
of it well you know songs about we uh
drugs
that's it that's the end that covers
almost every song that's ever been
written or the songs about partying
which might factor into the drugs one
yeah man versus nature man versus man
man versus self
man versus a large fish in the ocean
woman versus woman with a train
versus the government
man versus a house that constantly
changes its
architecture on him when he's not
looking
woman and man versus man who has a
genetic condition that can't stop him
from
time traveling um man versus
himself and also he ages as he gets
he gets younger as he gets older
etc man versus
large automobile woman versus
curved cement wall you know it's just
there's only like
10 different types of stories you can
write
man versus himself but maybe he's a
clone nobody in
ford versus ferrari that's another one
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
anyway that's my thoughts on music i'm
i'm done with it i've seen enough
um yes please yes please alien versus
predator i forgot about that one um
yeah okay sure yeah okay
um yeah can i get a water
this is a really good room but
i don't know what to take so i'm just
going to do that i don't want to swap
and take the other one because that
character has no hp and they'll die so
much for deals with the uh
the angel making baby on a roll yes sir
man with impressive metal claws versus
man who can manipulate metal with his
mind
we've these tales are as old as time
man versus 11 other men who want to
convict somebody on
suspect evidence dude okay but this i
think maybe we need this on the other
character
man versus food i forgot and man versus
wild of course
did you know they're making um
a naked and afraid game on steam i added
it to my steam wishlist
the discovery channel has uh
within the last couple of years they
added
a game division to their media empire
i'm still waiting for the 90 day fiance
game um
so they've oh there's enemies here
they uh if you'll excuse me i i don't
want to flip
dude i should have flipped you know what
no we flipped now
check this out okay hold on i had a
whole point on everything all right
this is how you swap cards um baby
he's done it yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah um
you flipping dodge coins you'll
you think you're jordan belfort you're a
little broker
um but did the discovery channels
releasing all sorts of interesting games
now it's like they're contracting
uh like the devs on steam who make like
you know
used car simulator and um i can't wait
for them to come out it's going to be a
new golden age man
they already made a deadliest catch game
that apparently is horrible
what do you expect i guess but on top of
that
um there is uh
the gold rush game that came out a few
years ago
but i can't wait for naked and afraid
man
i can't wait
who would you main in 90 day fiance
um i think that would be a sinjin maine
oh he takes some psychic damage every
time
tanya is on screen um
but on the flip side his he has the
highest default charisma stat
angela uh no i she's not my type of
character
and fisa who's oh i'm thinking of
larissa
they who oppose the queen will die
her verbal stat is is out of control
anyway that's um that's 90 day
season i've only seen famous clips
what else is on your wish list it's 95
well okay it's my summer car and then
like 12 other very dubious
simulator games that i um
just want to be emailed when they come
out so i can play them on the stream
i need to shoot saved
your kiss is on my list if you resist
and know if you insist on dude that was
no joke
that was my number one workout song when
i was when i was getting yoked
i would wake up in the morning with like
that in my head it's a it's an
incredible bop
especially like the the intro to the
second chorus where they modulate it
like normally he goes if you insist
unknowing my bliss
i'll tell you this but then the second
one
if you insist on knowing my bliss
i tell you they eat and you're like dude
this you got the voice of an angel man
i only smile as i lie then i'll tell you
why
because you'll piss your piss he's on
my lips that's that's a justin original
that's not mine
because your piss is on my lips
and my throat is not dry
okay sorry sorry great song though
i just i'm so sorry youtube
there's a different culture here on
twitch okay
if you insist on drinking my peers
i'll drink your piss sorry
sorry
much worse culture no i don't think so
i like the culture on on both twitch and
youtube
i've seen the kind of stuff you guys
like retweet don't he said piss
ooh i'm offended no you're not i've seen
the kind of horned up
yoshi like twerking on bowser's
phallus kind of stuff that you guys
tweet all the time
hey this person with a really
interesting avatar just
uh click the like button on my tweet
let's see what they're up to
oh programming student at university of
connecticut huh tweet number two
just yoshi some for some reason with a
gaping
uh aperture getting filled by like
uh birdo or something like that
and i'm like bro this is put that stuff
on your linkedin man twitter's for
business
i had to pick a school i i don't know if
i should be apologizing to the
university of connecticut
or or they should they're going to be
thanking me but
i took away
i had to pick a school it was either
that or ryerson and we've we've
we've taken some shots of ryerson
recently so i apologize
continue this bit if you insist i'll
continue this bit
i'll continue this bit if you want the
bit
to be continued
sorry
by the way no idea what we're doing
where we are etc
because this bit is on your lips
because your bit your bit it does
persist great dude now i gotta listen to
that song though
hauling notes some absolute slappers
i gotta say i'm kind of sick of like you
make my dreams come true
but like the rest of their singles
catalog especially is just like
unbelievable hollow notes favorite
cereal
oh dude yeah halls and oats green green
halls and honey bunches oats
delicious you can really taste the
the menthol outer touch is great
um private eyes
i like any song where like when you've
got two singers
you get to do um like the call-in
response in the middle of the song
like in the that's what i love so in
private eyes
pivot eyes they're watching you
they see y'all every and then oats holds
the
move and then hall goes they see it i
love dude that's why
i love taking it to the streets by the
doobie brothers
because literally that whole song just
exists for like
michael mcdonald to do ad-libs in the
middle of the chorus
i ain't blind and i know what i'm gonna
see
taking it to the hill taking it to the
taking into no name for taking it to
these taking it taking it too it just
like keeps
it's so good michael mcdonald
oh don't you now this runs going nowhere
now that i'm i'm on the michael mcdonald
train
what a fool believes absolutely
incredible song
not a great cereal though
what about toto bad bad band
with worse songs
sarah's smile look sarah's smile by
holland oates it's it's a good song
don't get me wrong it's on the greatest
hits album for a reason
um it's not it's not my favorite it
doesn't it doesn't ascend at the top of
the pile for me but
it's it's a good song
i you know i sarah smile does do
something i like
it gets like really intense before the
chorus usually songs like
they like you know they play it low into
the chorus and then in the chorus they
go for it like you know in rich girl
but um in sarah's smile they get like
really intense
and then in the chorus they bring it
down sarah
smile won't you smile for me
girl oh geez
anyway that's that's all i got that's
not even close to all i got but it's all
i feel comfortable sharing because
otherwise it's gonna make for the worst
commentary
in gaming history classic rock though
man classic rock
i can't go for that another great song
but i will say
i i like the part where he goes i can't
go for that
i could take or leave the parts where he
goes no can do
i do love the part where he goes
do almost anything that you want me to
but i don't like the part where he goes
no can do i think he could do better
than that
oh man
threaded then consider that needle
threaded buddy oh frick
what's your favorite christopher cross
song dude i only know
christopher cross not crisscross there's
two different bands
believe it or not i know it's hard to
believe great choice not taking
hemolacria on
the ipak character but i only know
christopher cross for two reasons
one is when i was uh doing some
maintenance on the house before we moved
in
it would always show up or he would
always show up on um
like my spotify playlist because it
would play 70s classic rock with machine
learning and the
the reason that i remember him is
because
on the album covers he looks like cobalt
streak
when he still had hair
like you can go look it up the first
time i i saw the album cover i was like
this guy looks a little bit like cobalt
streak tinted rock
thank you yeah cobalt's he's he's
temporarily bald
i think i want you know what let's do it
like this
that's the way to play it that's what
cobalt looked like in the 1970s
yeah dude it is like look it's like
petty drama that
isn't that big of a deal i mean to me
because it doesn't affect me i guess but
it is wild that like cobalt did not
appear in the twitch clip
of of isaac uh like repentance
footage
i can't really pledge solidarity because
because i was in it
but it was it was a little messed up
well i mean i don't think it was done
like purposely or anything like that but
still i'm like
i mean dude like cobalt definitely
deserves to be in the
in the compilation more than i do i mean
dude i was in a valheim compilation
at one point like i i can take one off
i only played valheim like like three
times
it's because they couldn't find a
family-friendly clip
you know there might be there might be
some truth to that
is the aha water good um
i like it i like that it comes in
in different flavors than just the
traditional like paplamus
lemon lime lemon lime um
but i uh everybody when i said i was
i was eating or drinking aha hey hey
hey hey hold on we can do this this is
this is how you get yourself in the
compilation baby
this is how you get yourself in the
compilation
one of these then we come back for the
other one later um
people were like in in particular uh
funky kong's
jorts said you gotta try the black
cherry coffee flavor
i google aha black cherry coffee first
thing i see
aha black cherry coffee from february 24
2021 has been discontinued in uh
in the united states of america and
canada
but literally it was it was not one
person
that said go try uh black cherry coffee
like four people in the space of two
minutes were like dude you gotta try the
black cherry coffee
it's legit one of the best sparkling
water flavors
and now it's uh you know now i want what
i can't have
it's like that time i went to jumbo
video with my dad
and we saw my uh this guy on my baseball
team his dad was coming out of the store
and then he was like hey you guys should
get your heart set on like watching uh
payback starring mel gibson
and then when we went into the store we
realized he was playing a prank on us
because all the copies of payback were
uh were taken they only had the box art
they didn't have any of the real vhs
tapes
all-time classic bit
i i choose to flip
mango black tea is pretty good too you
know what i'll give it a try
um if i can find it
you know that this is like it's a brief
window on this world
where we have all these sparkling water
brands like
within the next two years there's going
to be some consolidation
there's too many to survive right now
every time i go to the grocery store
there's like seven
brands of sparkling water that taste 96
identical to one another and i'm like
this cannot last
then again i don't know like mcdonald's
burger king and wendy's all do exist so
maybe it can totally last bro this sucks
by the way
um the spiders are unfightable
oh and get i mean don't even get me
started on burger king i have no idea
how that exists
i i th the impossible whopper
notwithstanding which i hear is actually
quite good
i have i've been to a burger king like
one time in the past seven years
and it was just because i was up early
in the morning and the bus stop had a
burger king next to it
if i had a choice and you usually do
when it comes to fast food
because they're in those weird like you
know parking lots that
17 uh fast food stores find themselves
right next to
what is the most fun fast food
restaurant to eat in though
like pizza hunt was always cool those
green tables with the
with the pine border on them and then do
i can still
the like a pitcher of pepsi and then
those
like model plastic cups for some reason
that's like
the the pepsi just tastes better
out of those cups i don't know how to
explain it
i kind of hate this but we're gonna keep
trying
not a big deal not a big deal
very helpful actually thank you
i'm trying to think of what else what
other restaurants fun to eat in
i'm not trying to flex but i did
occasionally accompany my parents to red
lobster as a kid
you know what can i say um but when
if you've never eaten at red lobster as
a child when you finish the meal they
bring out like a treasure chest full of
toys
and then you reach in there and you just
grab one and pull it out
but i feel like every time i went i
always got like a weird
like wooden airplane where i was just
like hey
i don't have any place to fly this you
know we're in the car for a half hour
drive home
but licks oh man
we've already talked about licks not not
today but in general
licks is the the canadian uh burger
chamber they
they sing your order back to you
restaurants are weird man like gimmick
restaurants
i'm not saying they're all bad like i've
eaten at
uh at dick's
in seattle which is arrested
now that i think about it actually it's
not called dicks it's called like the
this
it's a restaurant modeled after dicks or
something like that
it's called like the the lunch box maybe
where they're like rude to you
though the gimmick of the restaurant is
that the food is good but the servers
are mean
but the food is legitimately like pretty
good
um but then like all the gimmick
restaurants are weird to me like can't
your gimmick just be like
the food is good
there's like hey the servers are rude to
you hey the servers sing
um hey the the restaurant isn't just a
restaurant it's a weird animatronic
rainforest
there used to be a place i'm not sure if
it still exists but there's a place
that's very popular with tourists in
vancouver
called the elbow room cafe and i believe
that was their gimmick too i guess i'll
just die
their gimmick was just that they're mean
to you oh yeah no
you're not wrong the heart attack grill
i forgot about the heart attack grill
with the quadruple bypass burger where
if you're over like 35 bmi
or something like that you eat for free
and if you finish a quadruple bypass
burger then a hot
nurse wheels you out to your car in a
wheelchair
sure i guess i'll just get hit that's
okay
and of course don't forget about the the
wendy's gimmick um
a human finger in the chili
and of course don't forget about wendy
have you never noticed the the
popularity of gimmick restaurants these
days you got the rainforest cafe you got
the heart attack grill
and of course don't forget wendy's where
they put a human finger in the chili
a human finger in the chili
got a great show uh for you tonight
bobby moynihan's gonna be on the show
bobby moynihan musical guest
tame impala take it away max

as a uh oh
bro you suck okay i gotta finish my
story though
yankee swap taught me a very valuable
lesson in sixth grade
um it was exactly like the office we did
a yankee swap
for secret santa and there was one
present that was like
this big right you can't even see
because of the video frame
it was like like that big right so
everybody was like oh
i gotta get that in the yankee swap
pretty smart kid in middle school
managed to play the strategy right
to get that amazing present and yankee
swap i opened it up you know what it was
it's just a freaking huge novelty pencil
literally worthless you can't even write
with it because it's like
this big around right other kids were
getting like
you know chocolates and stuff like that
you know koosh balls and nerf toys and i
was getting
novelty pencil you can't you couldn't
even put it in my backpack on the way
home they wouldn't let me bring it on
the bus because it was like a weapon
