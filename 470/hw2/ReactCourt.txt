is the rare they are the [ __ ]
am i the [ __ ] for telling my wife to
bring my youngest daughter with her
i have two daughters elise and addie
addie is also my wife's daughter
and elise is from a previous
relationship
remember when i said that people are bad
at explaining things
like why is this phrased as if it's like
a brain teaser
is this one like the doctor is a woman
is that how it goes
[Laughter]
is that the doctor was the kid's mother
i have two daughters one of them is also
my wife's daughter and elise is from a
previous relationship okay
i understand elise used to only visit
every other weekend but two years ago
her mom died and she moved in with us
since then my wife has taken elise out
once a week to get lunch and dinner
and shop and get their nails done go to
the beach as well as taking out elise
for ice cream or hot cocoa after her
therapy sessions
you're already in hot water on this one
my man
my wife takes addie out but not as much
as elise and when they go out it's
usually just to the park then for ice
cream or to the zoo
yeah she's four years old she's a little
kid
i'm gonna take a little kid to the
manicurist she's going to the zoo
that's like a top tier that's a top
outing man i've been to the zoo like six
times in my whole life
they're planning an overnight trip in a
beach town a few hours away for elise's
birthday and addie's upset she doesn't
get to go so i told my wife to bring
addie with her my wife said addie
wouldn't like most of the stuff they do
together and even if she did all of her
attention would be on addie making sure
she doesn't run off or get hurt
i told my wife addie's upset about not
getting to go with them she needs to
make it fair but she snapped and said
that addie gets the majority of her
attention every day and this is her
making it fair to elise
she left and is refusing to talk about
this again i just wanted to know if i'm
the [ __ ]
yes uh i you
i you gotta admit
when you write the post and are in
control
of the uh the tone and the content of it
and you still come across
like the [ __ ] i bet in real life
you're like
even more in the wrong
not to not to put too much pressure on
the guy
but i'm not saying he's like a war
criminal
but yeah okay so he's kind of the
[ __ ]
why is he the [ __ ] um couple of
reasons
one is you know these kids are 15 and
four
you have to treat a 15 year old
differently than you treat
a four-year-old and vice versa you know
a four-year-old requires substantially
more maintenance and and supervision and
a 15-year-old you're starting to get
them to the point
where they're gonna be entering adult
life you know you gotta
allow them to start experiencing stuff
that's more contemporaneous of their age
and you know i hate to say it
as well but like if you're going on a
trip with a 15 year old who by the way
lost her mother and goes to therapy all
the time
uh for it which makes perfect sense
you know a four-year-old is gonna cramp
your style i don't mean it in like oh
so my other kid is coming along gross
you know you know what a drag but i mean
you're gonna have a different experience
going out you know on a trip
with uh you know a 15 year old and a 40
year old and a 15 year old a 40 year old
and a four year old
anyway on top of that uh
your four year old needs to learn that
not everything is for everyone like if
the kid is not an
[ __ ] for being mad the kid is
four years old but like kids get mad at
stuff all the time
they like for no reason like
i i cried over you know as a kid i
uh cried over like the dumbest things
you could possibly imagine
when i was three i watched beetlejuice i
was traumatized for like years
the username is wifetrip which is is
kind of hilarious
yeah i still get upset over useless
stuff but uh
anyway long story short you are you're
the [ __ ]
i do also want to throw in like a
potential caveat here
which is that it kind of seems like
you want her to take both kids so that
you
can have some time to yourself
so you're like a little bit of a super
[ __ ]
if you're using the feelings and
emotions of your four-year-old
as like a cover because you actually
just want some time off which is a
natural reaction
for sure to want some time to yourself
but
you know you could also just take care
of the baby
or the toddler i guess yourself anyway
um you're the [ __ ] good lord your
wife is being a great stepmom
to your teenage daughter who just lost
her mom small kids get upset about not
being able to do the same things their
older siblings
do and that's normal you as a parent
have to deal with that disappointment
this is also
normal as part of being a parent make it
a daddy-daughter weekend do fun stuff
build stuff put a putter in her hands
whatever
is this person work at topgolf
or dick's sporting goods it's so
specific
the weekend andy stuff is now up to you
can you make it fun for her

what happened here
oh no no no
definitely he just wants an alone
weekend i know
people are like they whispered
look at his posts i don't i don't want
to look at his replies because then
you know it's like cyberbullying him but
uh
i could guess based on some of the
replies in there that
uh probably it wasn't reflected that
well
on him
[Laughter]
um i gotta know how this one goes man
am i the [ __ ] for walking out of the
house after the host told me to feel
free to leave because she doesn't like
people in her house
this just happened like an hour ago
backstory dating this guy and his best
friend was having a small party if you
can call it that whoa
hold on
[Laughter]
rude but also good one there were 10
people there at most i wasn't invited
but boyfriend
for lack of a better term what the hell
is going on
she's so sassy told me it would be okay
if i came usually i wouldn't go
somewhere without an invite but since
this is his best friend's house i
assumed he knew the situation better
than me
i show up go inside meet the best friend
and she didn't know i was coming
boyfriend says
hey this is who i told you about i
wanted you guys to meet the best friend
turns to me with a straight face and
says yeah it's all right i guess
but feel free to leave because i don't
really like people in my house
it's probably the weirdest thing you
could say to somebody
when you first meet them especially when
you're having a party
so i left i turned around and walked out
without saying another word now to be
completely fair my boyfriend was shocked
he came after me and said that he had no
idea that she would react that way but
she was just having a bad night and we
should go back in and everything would
be okay
obviously i left he didn't come with me
but now he's texting me and saying that
while she was a bit rude i was even more
rude
for just walking out in front of
everyone and that made for a weird vibe
with all the other friends who were
there
so am i the [ __ ] did i overreact hold
on
context there's a language barrier here
she speaks greek slash italian as first
languages and i english
so honestly her intent was questionable
but the look on her face gave me a weird
vibe
okay the the rest of this i'm not i'm
not worried about
um
i english
uh my my hunch here
i mean first off
i have occasionally said something
maybe not the strangers but like i've
said something
rude as like a joke or maybe i thought
it was a joke and the tone was bad
they took it literally and it it it has
happened before okay
so i'm putting myself in the mindset of
the the host
who maybe thought she was telling a joke
like i wouldn't it be weird if someone
who just met you told you to get the
[ __ ] out of their house
and then they're like whoa hold on you
didn't get i was joking
i was joking you know i'm saying it
could happen
but it it no matter what kind of an
[ __ ] joke from the host
language barrier accepted um
but the boyfriend come on man
the boyfriend didn't the this the the
headline here should not be am i the
[ __ ] for walking out of the house
really like it it's not if the host
wants to be an [ __ ] in their own
house then so be it
not you know my prerogative but the
boyfriend
staying at the party after they left
is like damning that's terrible
i would boyfriend in my opinion is the
[ __ ]
honestly i'm inclined to think that the
op in this situation
actually is kind of based
it's like not not the [ __ ] for one
but even beyond that like i'm giving you
a promotion i'm saying
why be you're based to have the
the stones to when somebody says feel
free to leave i don't like when people
are in my house to begin with
to just turn around and walk out
honestly that's
commendable
i give op the base award not the [ __ ]
your boyfriend and his friend are he
didn't come with you when you left
that's an [ __ ] move
ps does she have the hots for your
boyfriend see that's why i
i did i thought about the you can't
know that in advance that's the thing
you read into it for sure
but still
look you can't look at this in just from
one sentence be like they
you know they were definitely hooking up
you don't know they they might
they might just be a [ __ ]
can i kind of say that the the host is
based as well
i mean i think that they said something
that was rude for sure very impolite
but if you actually don't like people in
your house
and then like you invited 10 people and
someone brought a plus one
and you're like feel free to leave
because i don't like strangers then i'm
i'm kind of like you know what fair
enough
everybody's based here except your
boyfriend who is an [ __ ]
some of these headlines like
this one sorry okay
originally i was gonna say am i the
[ __ ]
am i the [ __ ] for not telling my
friend's daughter the truth about being
a paramedic
that's just uh i want to know how that
story goes
but i don't know if i can
not read this one am i the [ __ ]
for talking about my aunt's watermelon
ass
dan you ready for this one
my son and his friend put up a tire
swing in the yard for my grandchild
i posted a picture of me swinging in it
on facebook
my aunt dad's sister commented on it
saying
i hate skinny people this is one hell of
a start
i'm not one for facebook drama so
instead of commenting back i called her
i basically said i don't talk about her
watermelon ass
so she shouldn't be talking
now all my aunts five of them
are mad at me because apparently skinny
people can't be body shamed and i should
have told her first that i don't like
those comments instead of straight out
calling her on her watermelon
ass
he keeps typing him in i don't think i'm
the [ __ ]
because it's not like i told her i'm
skinny because my sisters and i have
always exercised more so we didn't
inherit the family watermelon ass
but skinny is also something i didn't
have to really work for it's just how i
am edit i
accept my everybody sucks here verdict
but i'm gonna take that to mean i suck
and so do all five of my aunts
if i'm going down they're going down
with me
i'm gonna be honest uh okay i've been
i've been doing this for too long i
slipped into the react mindset
i was gonna say not the [ __ ] but
they are kind of the [ __ ] but they're
also based
even though it was a private call you
didn't have to say
that your aunt had a watermelon ass to
her face
you could have just said hey i don't
like when you leave those sorts of
comments
on my facebook
i uh don't appreciate it it makes me
feel bad
that's one thing using the phrase
i basically said that i don't talk about
your watermelon ass so you shouldn't
talk about my weight
while hilarious
kind of makes you an [ __ ] being an
[ __ ] in response to having someone be
an [ __ ] to you
still it look it doesn't make you as
much of an [ __ ] as the
patient zero [ __ ] um but it probably
it gives
it does make you a little bit of an you
could have handled it better but i'm
glad you didn't because the story was so
entertaining
i basic can you imagine i if you were
listening to that phone call
like maybe you know they were doing the
call while you were on the couch or
something like that
yeah well i don't talk about your
watermelon ass so you shouldn't talk
about my weight
i can't even imagine oh man
the the ones that are not not the
[ __ ]
are so good by the way uh record lowest
margin fees by stockbrokers.com borrow
against securities
uh at low cost with interactive brokers
i'm only going for the [ __ ] ones now
am i the [ __ ] for yelling at my
stepfather when he suggested he could
walk me down the aisle
i gotta know man i gotta know
am i the [ __ ] for yelling at my
stepfather when he suggested he could
walk me down the aisle
so two weeks ago i got married to my
husband 25 female 26
male when i was six my mom and dad got
divorced and three years later my mom
met and married fred
the youtube guy
had basically been my surrogate dad for
all these years because my biological
one hasn't been a huge part of my life
and fred's kids are basically my
siblings
on last minute my bio dad decided he
didn't want to come to my wedding and
walk me down the aisle i got the call
while i was getting my makeup done and i
was devastated
needless to say fred was in the room and
he started comforting me telling me it
would be okay and he said if you want i
could walk you down
okay look you can see how this goes
she's upset she just had a
a staggering emotional blow
fred i here's what i'm inclined to say
if this goes where you expect it to go
okay
fred steps in knowing that this
is a stomach on top of a hand grenade
he he knows that there's a decent chance
that he's going to take some collateral
damage as a result of this
so i'm inclined to think that that fred
knew he was going to take a bullet here
and has no
even though maybe she was an [ __ ] to
him
i bet fred was like no she's not the
[ __ ]
you know terry's the [ __ ]
sometimes you gotta you know the right
thing to do is to offer and then when
you get clipped
you're like you know i knew that could
happen
that rubbed me the wrong way i was
already a mess emotionally fred knew how
much i wanted my bio dad to walk me down
the aisle
and he just suggested it like it didn't
matter at all okay
she's kind of the [ __ ]
for even now two weeks later still
thinking fred is a [ __ ]
you can be angry in the moment but two
weeks later being like
he still did something wrong you got
with
the benefit of hindsight should make
this a little bit more apparent
i hadn't just gotten my heart broken i
just snapped and told him he was selfish
and
told him to get out fred left and one of
my uncles ended up walking me down the
aisle
i didn't expect it to to turn that fast
in a single
uh in a single paragraph
my mom only heard about mine and fred's
fight after the wedding and she is now
pissed off at me telling me i
overreacted and i need to apologize to
fred
even though i was just frustrated and he
had suggested something totally out of
left field
she needs a copywriter what do you mean
suggested something completely out of
left field it's like the most
inevitable suggestion of all like you're
you're the step that can you imagine
being the stepdad
and then like you're in the room with
her
her bio dad deadbeat calls
and goes uh i can't make it or whatever
the footies on uh plus my fiance is at
the hospital three hours away
selfish lady um and then she's crying
and then in her head she's like
you know i if anybody asks me to help
then i'm gonna
freaking snap he's there like oh
awkward well i um it's obvious he's
gonna suggest that he's gonna walk you
down the aisle he's like your dad
at this point
anyway fred what a [ __ ] dude
yeah he's gonna be like that sucks peace
out unless you go check on your mother
um my mom told me i was the selfish one
apparently and apparently i'm ungrateful
selfish i don't know that's tough
ungrateful yes
extremely but i feel like his suggestion
was
completely wrong and then i don't need
to apologize but i don't want to make
things worse by not apologizing
if i did do something wrong hey um
if this is real and you believe in the
sentence that you're saying here
which is i don't want to make things
worse by not apologizing if i did do
something wrong
i'm only a few years older than you but
i want to give you some advice
just apologize you
you can apologize sincerely
not being like sorry i guess you can
apologize
even if your heart's not a hundred
percent in it
you can you can recognize someone else's
feelings were hurt by your actions
and be the bigger person and be like hey
i
am explaining explaining the context for
why i was upset to begin with explaining
why to some extent i still feel like i
was in the right but also at the same
time i apologize to you because i know
that i hurt your feelings
and your relationship as my stepdad who
raised me for the last 16 years
it means more than like this one little
flashpoint emotional incident that we
had
um i if i was fred
i'd be like first off because i'm
checking am i the [ __ ] every day
i would be like great job um i'm glad
reddit told you to apologize
guess what you can't borrow the beamer
tonight
you got to take the ford escort
and your honeymoon it's not honolulu
anymore
hold on there's a great job it's not
honolulu anymore
but don't worry i made reservations at
benahana
uh anyway um but fred he seems like he's
better than that
okay he seems like he's better than that
um
let's see what happened
you're the [ __ ] you just said your
bio dad oh god it's a numbered list
you just said your bio dad wasn't
involved in your life your stepdad was
your dad growing up your stepdad didn't
impose himself at all until your bio dad
flat out rejected your request
your stepdad was trying to be supportive
and you rejected him if he hadn't
offered would you have been happier stop
projecting your anger at your bio dad on
your step dad 43 000 upvotes
[Laughter]
rough biking aims based she just got
blew
up
[Laughter]
oh no
i do it the the [ __ ] comments are too
easy man
it's like you just open it up and you
feel good the not the [ __ ] are like
they're so much more reasonable
hold on watermelon ass
i gotta i gotta know this one am i the
[ __ ]
for not telling my friend's daughter the
truth about being a paramedic
please don't repost anywhere okay you
know then
let's not
okay am i the [ __ ] for driving away
from a hiking trip with my boss's
husband
i recently female 26 moved to a new city
after getting a job
i've been having a hard time making
friends most of the people i know so far
are from work
we all get along but we aren't close
more like acquaintances
very reasonable so far my boss sue has
been very welcoming since i moved she
often has us all over for dinner she
loves to celebrate whenever there's a
baby
birthday big milestone on the team
last week i was out to lunch with sue
and a few other co-workers when sue told
me about a hiking group her husband runs
and how it's a great way
to meet people she said she'd be he'd be
leading a hike on monday
and the whole team should go since it's
a holiday monday was my birthday but i
hadn't told anyone i didn't have any
other plans so i said yes to the hike
these are normal people so far i can't
wait to see what kind of monkey wrench
[ __ ] the whole thing off i drove to the
meeting spot on monday which is kind of
remote and up in the hills
nobody was there when i arrived beside
sue's husband greg
okay i asked him where everyone was he
said no one else could make it and it
would just be us on the hike
it was early morning and still dark and
i didn't know greg other than seeing him
in passing at sue's house
i knew he was probably a nice guy but i
felt nervous going hiking in a dark
remote area with a man who's practically
a stranger
completely reasonable
in fact greg probably should have sent
something to the group chat
that was like hey we're calling it off
this monday
because i wouldn't feel comfortable
going on a walk with a stranger as well
in the dark
he could get murdered too but i guess
he's not that worried about that
i called sue and she told me that
something came up with her kid but i
should go it'll be worth it for the view
etc
i still felt unsettled and asked greg if
we could postpone for a day when others
can come
he got frustrated yo spinning machine
thank you
thank you for the gifted subs he got
frustrated saying it's no big deal we
should hurry up and start
red flag i was more nervous at that
point and thanked him before saying i
was gonna head home
that upset him even more and he came
toward me and asked if i thought he was
a serial killer
he seemed angry so i panicked and jumped
in the car saying i had to go
he kept yelling at me to stop as i drove
away
would a serial killer do this
i was on the way home terrified when sue
called me apparently the hiking trip was
a cover for a surprise birthday party
the team was throwing me at the lookout
point oh come on
she found out my birthday through
facebook and greg was supposed to lead
me there i felt terrible and offered to
drive back but sue was pissed
and said i ruined it for everyone and
made greg feel like a creeper
now the environment at work is tense sue
and my coworkers
only talk to me when they need something
and they didn't invite me to team
lunch i feel like i really messed up
possible fake story okay if this is not
a fake story
in my opinion the biggest [ __ ] are
actually the co-workers
like your boss and her husband being
deluded because they were too close to
the source
it happens your your team members who
can get a bird's-eye view of the
situation and could completely
understand why you thought you were
gonna get murdered by your boss's
husband
being like we're gonna ice you that's a
[ __ ] move
um the boss should have led you there
for sure
i mean if this is no you're not the
[ __ ]
and and this might even be controversial
nobody involved is the [ __ ] for
setting up the surprise
party a little bit of like the dumbest
way possible to do it like hey we're
colleagues or acquaintances um at best
we're gonna throw a super sketchy
situation or lead you to a surprise
party
not the way you should do it but pretty
dumb not [ __ ] necessarily
uh everybody icing you afterwards huge
[ __ ] if this story is real
uh you're obviously not the [ __ ] uh
of course get in the van it's for a
surprise party
i love the idea it does make more sense
now
like if i was leading a hiking trip and
only one person showed up and they were
like i'm gonna leave so
i don't think you're gonna murder me but
just in case i'm gonna leave i would be
like
yeah that's perfectly reasonable that
makes complete sense
um but
i well i certainly would not just go hey
what do you think i'm a serial killer
but if there was a surprise party like a
kilometer away
and they were relying on me to get the
birthday person to the surprise party
i might get a little i'd be like no come
back i'm
i'm normal you know like i that might
get me to be angry
not angry you know what you're right i
probably would have just been like hey
but that would have been so much
creepier if you're like hey
there's a there's a surprise party for
you all your friends are there at the
top of the cliff
that would have been like way scarier i
think i'd be like i'll just
[Laughter]
i don't know it's just a bad situation
all around
i always say
yeah just don't do that to begin with
okay let's find some
[ __ ] man
let's find some [ __ ] i did like this
one i i had to know where this one was
coming man
am i the [ __ ] for not giving up my
bed to a pregnant woman
my grandma is on her last days
probably not the [ __ ] in this
situation
and wish to see all her grandkids for
the last time
so my family came up with a plan to
visit her we're all adults in our 20s
didn't want to deal with the airport
chaos so we decided to drive
los angeles to durango we rented an
eight-seat van since it was six of us my
two brothers and their wives and my
cousin
the day of the trip we find out one of
my sister-in-law's anna invited her
sister ruby
i need to bust out the white board
invited her sister ruby to come along
said she wanted to get out of the house
and because we had extra space
this is not a real story
nobody in history especially someone
that's pregnant
is going to be like i've got nothing
else to do let's go on like a
20-hour road trip that's just it's
unbelievable
it undermines the rest of the story
everyone was okay with it but i was a
little annoyed since i wanted my cousin
with cerebral
palsy to ride more comfortably but it
seemed like he was fine with it so i
didn't worry yeah okay
look if the story is is real there's
certainly a lot of factors in here baked
in from the get-go
that make it seem like op is uh
absolved of all possible judgment
i drove the first seven hours of the
trip we'd already booked two rooms with
two queen beds each in advance one room
was dedicated for my two brothers and
their wives and the other for my cousin
and i
when we were heading to check on our
rooms ruby by the way we don't want to
deal with the airport chaos
having 10 adults get their passports
scanned get a ticket sit in the chair
arrive at your destination
picking what restaurant to eat at in the
terminal
so messy who needs to deal with it you
know what we'll do instead
i will just drive up we'll book several
hotel rooms and
here's the room that you're in everybody
and
you know like this way easier this way
we'll rent a car
we'll strap in my cousin who has
cerebral palsy this should what could
possibly go wrong
right we get into the room
i'm not even reading the rest of the
hotel stuff because i
come on just just take uh if you said
we're not going to fly because it's
expensive okay if you said we're not
gonna fly
because of the mess this is like i mean
this is
it's like a 45 minute flight man anyway
not to mention why why ruby
wants to be involved with this to begin
with oh you guys are gonna go see
you're gonna go watch your grandma die
well if you got space in the car i got
nothing going on that sounds like it
could be uh
could be exciting it's just none of the
story checks out at all
if it's real i'm being very insensitive
and i apologize
but um okay ruby
immediately asks where i'm sleeping i
stayed quiet but then laughed because i
thought she was
joking i explained to her that we were
sharing the bed since my cousin with
cerebral palsy needs his own bed
she said anna told her she would be
getting this bed and she needs to have
her own bed because she's pregnant i
told her no we're sharing this bed
she quickly became upset and called her
sister to come talk to me anna of course
sided with her sister
i was furious at this point i drove
seven hours i just want to sleep
can i can i say something another
unbelievable part of this what what kind
of what kind of freak
says let's go on a road trip
i love road trips seven hours of driving
they're like
i'm so freaking zonked
i need to pass out that's not
i don't like road trips i've driven
seven hours in a sitting
i'm not like i gotta go to bed i'm like
let's get a let's get dinner or
something it's a long
drive but you chose to do the road trip
because it sounds like fun
all right i lost chat on that one but
regardless if you love road trips so
much you can't complain about seven
hours that's just my two cents i drove
seven hours i just wanted to sleep i
told her she could sleep with me
in the bed i paid for eventually
everyone from the other room comes over
there's an
entire argument among us with everyone
taking sides
i was told i was being selfish because
ruby is pregnant i'm sorry but i offered
her to sleep with me
not to kick me out of my own bed there's
so many bed-based
stories on am i the [ __ ] huh
i didn't realize how many stories about
bed sharing
or uh present here
okay i will fight everyone before i
sleep on a floor
or a hotel room i paid for when i get
out there's gonna be carnage
eventually i laid down on one side of
the bed and did not move
they tried to wake me up so i could move
but i wouldn't budge i just laid there
until they left the room eventually ruby
laid down on the other side of the bed
and we all woke to the next day
there's tension among us even though
we're back in ca now
anna her husband one of my brothers anna
her husband one of my brothers and ruby
think i'm a selfish person for not
giving up my bed to a pregnant woman
on the other hand my other brother and
his wife as well as my cousin side with
me even though i do feel bad i still
offered ruby a space am i the [ __ ]
um
you are a fiction writer and this would
be a great
sketch comedy sketch
that's my thought on this i also want to
interview
anna the pregnant woman who thought
because she's got nothing to do
like when you're it depends how pregnant
you are to begin with i suppose
but if you're let's assume you know
she's like
four or five months on you're getting
you know morning sickness you got a
bowling ball
in your abdomen your your moods going up
and down you've got
gastrointestinal issues you got to take
like
you you get random cravings for stuff
you want to nap at 2 pm you want to wake
up at 4 00 am
you got to take prenatal vitamins and
folic acid
every single day you got again who is
like
let's go on a road trip like the most
inconvenient way to travel
especially on on top of being pregnant
to begin with
and then it's like you don't even get to
like coachella at the end you just get
to
you know watch someone else's grandma in
hospice
it's just a weird it's just a weird
story
if true everybody sucks here but mostly
i just want to interview the lady
anyway
am i the [ __ ] for telling my sister
what she said is a hipaa violation
probably not
okay i'm i'm looking i'm looking for red
flare am i the [ __ ] for not paying
half of my boyfriend's rent and bills
there could be there could be some
some meat on that one there could be
some
meat on that one
gonna try and be brief here due to the
character limit well that's a first
my boyfriend 26 male and i 24 female
have been dating for just over two years
we never lived together
well i would say you're not the [ __ ]
then so far
that's if you don't live together then
no you shouldn't be paying half his rent
my boyfriend took a job in a different
city two hours away without asking me
for my opinion or telling me
that he'd applied for it it was his
dream job and so not taking it was never
an option he said he never asked me to
move with him
but even if he had asked i wouldn't have
been able to i live in the same town as
my parents who are both ill and i
wouldn't want to move away while they
still need me my job is also here the
city he's moving to is also nearly twice
as expensive to rent in
this obviously caused some friction
between us and we nearly broke up but i
ultimately agreed to visit him regularly
that's a lot of context to start with
also secondarily i don't understand what
your boyfriend could possibly be mad
about
right now when you move to a city
without asking somebody and they're like
no
what are you gonna you can't be mad
since he moved i've gone to visit him
once or twice a month for a week at a
time when covet allows it and it's not
cheap
the train to see him is about 50 bucks
each way
we don't live in the u.s but that's the
current conversion rate
so i'm spending one to two hundred
dollars each month to see him
and i pay half of any grocery shopping
we do okay this i feel like i'm
unschooled again
i i do love you can tell at first i was
like maybe they're canadian
then i realized they must be european
because they think a 50
train fee is like egregious whereas in
north america if you take the train one
stop it's like 300
i'm not i'm this is not like money
lording like oh you think that's
expensive it's just genuinely
it in north america the rail
infrastructure means that
taking a train is unbelievably expensive
well maybe not in the northeast
okay but on the west coast for sure
but i think uh this is a situation where
maybe in europe you could uh
take the train from amsterdam to
belgrade for like 75 bucks
trained to my nearest city is seven
dollars that's crazy man
anyway sorry i get mired in the
logistics a little bit
um i pay half of the grocery shopping we
do i also rent my own apartment back in
my hometown
when i visit him i stay at his apartment
where he lives alone
and pays 975 dollars per month in rent
okay i understand last week he told me
he wants me to start paying half his
bills and half the rent for when i come
to stay with him
your boyfriend is uh
stupid i don't even need to read the
rest of the story
it like he he's got an okay thing going
here
you really want to spend half of your
time together doing like an excel
spreadsheet of like well you were here
from the 11th to the 19th
uh the month this is february it only
has 28 days so i'm gonna need you to pay
half of a third of the rent and then
also
this is how much data we used over this
like just become an accountant if this
is the kind of stuff that gets you hard
this is i i understand if you need the
the means but this might be like a
breakup situation
in this case like this it does seem like
a a cash app
question for ninth grade unschooled
okay i told him i wasn't okay with that
for a few reasons he's the one who chose
to move to an expensive city without any
of my input
yes can i can i add as well as
maybe this is too technical but his rent
is inelastic whether she's there or not
it's going to cost 975 dollars a month
i'm assuming like i don't know how much
electricity costs there but i can't
imagine that
you know having one more person in the
house would raise the water and
electrical bill by more than like 10 or
15 percent like
it just seems like a little it just
seems needless
you know i told him i wasn't okay i
already paid 100 and 200 to 200
on train fares to see him now what she
is not
noting is that sure she's paying for the
train ticket but
she also gets to go on a train ride
which is a lot of fun
so if anything i don't know why she's
trying to act like that's a cost that
she doesn't want to bear
is like being on a pedestrian roller
coaster so that's
that's the first time i think that maybe
she's the [ __ ]
i have to pay for my own apartment if i
paid half his rent my cost of living
would be higher than his for a situation
i didn't choose
he replied that it wasn't fair that his
bills increased when i came to visit him
because of the water and electricity
he's actually not her boyfriend he's
her landlord i told him my train fare
was the equivalent of that
and also much more expensive than just
my portion of the water
so if he wanted me to pay half the bills
then he would have to pay half my train
fare
this wouldn't be fair as he's not the
one taking the train
so he shouldn't have to pay
my own twisted brain actually
came to the conclusion of where this guy
was going
oh i'm supposed to pay half of your
train fare and i don't get to even
get the thrill of going on the train
oh my god at this point i just told him
pay
half my train fare or we both move
somewhere that isn't expensive or i
stopped visiting
he told me i was unwilling to compromise
which apparently is just
doing whatever he says and not
suggesting anything else
and the atmosphere has been frosty ever
since i don't think i'm being
unreasonable but i've spoken to a few
friends and the opinion seems split
so i'm putting it to the reddit hive
mind
[Laughter]
seems pretty split not the [ __ ] and i
think you're on to something with the
option to stop visiting
haha yeah that's pretty much where i'm
at right now
all right sounds like you know
my ex-husband bought a house without
discussing it with me and quit his job
without discussing it with me
who are these people man this is crazy
your husband bought a house without
asking about it
not the [ __ ] this guy is not a keeper
i love dude it's jim from the office
it's such a great line i asked him to
pay half my train fare he said why i'm
not taking the train
oh man that's so good
all right we we got one more i think am
i the [ __ ] for saying i'll see you
there to my ex's aunt telling me i'm
going to hell
forget that i don't know if that that's
that's a story you come up with in your
head
in the shower after you had an argument
i just want to see
just want to see one more [ __ ]
situation
[ __ ] am i the [ __ ] mother-in-law
refuses to check
baby sugar levels
am i the [ __ ] for not letting my son
move out come on come
on am i the [ __ ] for telling my
brother not to bring his wife to family
events
league of legends oh no no
no this is the longest post i've ever
seen in my life
i come from a very orthodox family
there's certain rules for women in my
family like not wearing revealing
clothing such as jeans
makeup or roaming around alone at night
that's the problem
with western women they're always doing
crazy stuff like putting on
denim pants and roaming around at night
you you talk to any american woman you
ask her what she likes to do she's like
i like to put on my levi's
just go roaming not really with like any
kind of purpose or goal in mind just
kind of you know feeling it out out
there
i'm aware that most of it's unfair but
they won't change and i can't move out
without losing all contact with my
family
a few years back i started attending
this language class my parents agreed
very reluctantly
as long as you don't wear jeans no jeans
i don't want you
showing off your body in those
incredibly stiff denim pants
and became friends with a girl there
introduced her to my older brother who
would pick me up from class
long story short they fell in love and
eloped probably the most
work that long story short has ever done
my mother was devastated she cried for
days and blamed me for introducing that
witch to my brother
my brother moved into an apartment
pretty close of ours but maintained his
distance and gradually died down
i'm assuming that the brother didn't die
down there's the
the controversy until this year when
they finally decided to reconcile
i thought they would tone things down
and slowly get my parents to approve of
their marriage it was naive of me to
think that
my sister-in-law only wears short pants
and skirts for every family event
this she's wild man she's like madonna
she talks about moving to europe never
having kids and everything else that
would give my mother a stroke
she has the luxury of saying all this
and running back to the safety of her
house
she's got the luxury
of living her life how she wants to
and then running away to a place that
she probably partly pays for
well i sit here with no choice but to
deal with my mom's insanity
i'm the one who has to sit through the
aftermath the minute she leaves my
parents start yelling about how much
shame and bad luck she's gonna bring our
family
they also never forget to point out that
none of this would have happened if i
hadn't gone to that language class
that seems fair i repeatedly asked my
sister-in-law
to just wear normal clothes can you stop
with the freak stuff the short pants
come on like you're enjoying this are
you you sicko
showing up wearing your short pants and
skirts
you just wear some normal clothes for a
few hours but she doesn't listen
i guess this is her way of rebelling or
getting revenge
recently my older sister gave birth to a
child and there's plenty of ceremonies
that are to be performed
these ceremonies are huge most of my
relatives will be attending
i can only imagine the fights that will
start at home
my brother called to ask me if there's
something he could do [ __ ]
[ __ ]
[ __ ] i straight up told him not to
show up or
show up without your wife he called me
an [ __ ] and said i was just like our
parents
[Laughter]
oh i know that the only people in the
wrong here are my parents
you're half right you're half right on
that
but i know them and i know they won't
change and i
don't think wearing different sets of
clothes for a few hours is a big deal
and if it is they can just not attend
so i think i'm not the [ __ ] but maybe
i just can't see it so tell me reddit
english is not my first language so
ignore my mistakes your english is
fantastic your language class if that's
was
if that was what it was for really pay
dividends you're very erudite and
articulate
unfortunately the content of your post
is bad [ __ ]
insane um i'm
also terrified because
the edit is probably three times longer
than the original post so let's see what
kind of context we can get here
edit i live in a south asian country
definitely do not have the resources or
the support to leave my family
at least not right now okay i have no
issues with what my sister-in-law wears
if i was i never would have even
befriended her
which i did before she married my
brother thank you very much
i'm i'm a free thinker just because
she's wearing jeans
i mean i don't judge someone just for
the choice of pants they choose to wear
when i said she talks about being child
free and moving to europe i did not mean
she
should not do so what i was trying to
say is she's aware that this will
upset my parents and will still bringing
up bring it up in front of them
i'm guessing most of the comments are
from people in the west it might be easy
to walk away from your family where you
live family is everything you have here
however i asked for judgment from an
impartial source so i will accept
whatever verdict i get
can i tell you that's all fair
that i can't disagree with that
i will also say and okay they did also
say they're going to be turning 17 this
year
i walk back i walk back a little bit of
the foul language i use that i
i assumed they were in their 20s so
by the way your english is so good
that's crazy
at first i was like your english is
great
and now i'm like your english is amazing
we're walking it back we're walking it
back
and i also understand
when you're in it well i understand at
least the idea you know i've lived in
essentially the same culture my entire
life when you're
in a culture that has a different
opinion than somewhere else i'm sure
that you know
some of the statements that seem
ridiculous to somebody who's grown up in
north america
it seems perfectly normal and someone
that grew up in the culture wouldn't
actually
see anything wrong with what they're
saying
in my defense
thinking that jeans are revealing is
really funny it's actually like one of
the funniest things in my opinion has
ever been written
anywhere online have you ever seen
jinko's
maybe jinko's would be okay
i i just love the idea that she's
she's showing up in in jeans showing off
just showing off and revealing jingles
whispering all the time
anyway sorry so let's
continue i thought i mentioned my age in
my post but i didn't i'll be turning 17
this year so no i just can't leave
very fair leaving would mean running
away and they'll just call the cops to
bring me back
that part probably didn't need to be
said but i get your point so there's no
point
my brother doesn't see anything wrong
with how my parents treat me his
progressive only starts and ends with
his wife he will definitely not let me
move in with him your brother
is not the [ __ ] here why are you
being so rude to your brother
he's ju your brother is just out here
living his own life
and all he you're like he's a [ __ ]
because he won't let me stay with him i
don't know
like you're 17.
the whole situation is fair if he's a
teenager it's definitely more fair
but he is kind of an [ __ ] for asking
his brother not to bring his wife to the
to the the wedding or the the ceremony
some of you send really nice messages
but there's also a lot of mean ones so
i'm sorry but i'm not just going to open
any of them
fair enough since most people have voted
for [ __ ] i'm going to accept that
for an update nothing has changed in the
positive direction
my brother was really annoyed with the
way that i spoke to him yesterday since
i'm younger than him
he might also be
annoyed because you said
don't bring your wife to the ceremony
has nobody brought this up to op
yet i feel like it would save a lot of
problems
maybe it's cultural that you don't talk
back to somebody that's older than you
and your family but also
i think cross-culturally you don't tell
your family like hey you can come to the
party but don't bring your wife because
she's skanking it up in her levi's
there's a silver lining though i called
my older sister and told her what
happened
and she's asked me to come stay with her
for a week under the guise of helping
her prepare for the ceremony so
hopefully
they'll forget about this by the time we
meet next i did reach out to my
sister-in-law
but she hasn't responded which i guess
is fair
i did send her an apology i also want to
apologize to all the people from the
west for implying family isn't as
important to you
i was very angry when i wrote that i had
a whole night to think about it i was
definitely wrong of me so i'm very sorry
i that's look that's pretty impressive
for a teenager probably getting piled on
here not the least of which by me as
well
like that that being said
i can only speak from my own position
but i was like i think you're kind of in
the right
it sounds like your family is is
probably more important than i would
consider the average north american's
family to be
i feel like a lot of the other like did
i mean did you see what the lady said to
her stepdad
when her stepdad was like maybe i can
walk you down the aisle and she told him
to go get bent
i don't think that would happen if the
shoe was on the other foot here so i
i don't think he was totally out of the
out of line
anyway verdict verdict on this one long
story short
look it's like real court okay
if you're 16 you can still murder
somebody like you could be charged with
murder
but my hands are tied i can't condemn
you to being an [ __ ]
because you're you're not of the legal
age to put an [ __ ] prison
so as far as i'm concerned you're did
you
did you commit the crime of being an
[ __ ] yes in my opinion
the the context adds a lot to this as
i'm sure it would add a lot to every
situation
however you did tell your brother hey
come to the ceremony but don't bring
your wife because she's
you know showing off her ankles and
those capri pants
so i think you're on probation
when you turn 18 your record gets uh
expunged also your parents
like from an outside observer standpoint
kind of suck
definitely kind of sucks so maybe more
than kind of
anyway that was fun
that was a that was a fun segment let me
take it off the main screen for a second
uh i'm gonna run to the bathroom



just to set the stage i'm hoping that
that the title screen just has an
endless loop
i'm hoping it doesn't just uh stop after
the song is done and then lead to me
restarting it but whether it is or it
isn't that's okay
i'm excited um it's been i
i mean the it's been a week i'm looking
i i i don't browse our slash am i the
 throughout the week
because i don't want to uh spoil myself
for what's gonna happen
but seeing that the first person who
made a post here deleted their account
my god something something must have
gone wrong
i can't imagine what it actually is but
uh maybe it attracted a little bit too
much attention or something like that
but i'm excited either way
um oh yeah that's top today that's not
top this week you're absolutely right
user was awarded silver for this post
so true my my fellow gentle sir okay
let's let's load up top by this week
uh it's oh my god i
i'm preserving it for you a little bit
here
get ready for this okay this is a good
one
um
right here
am i the for calling my sister's
husband useless
i'm gonna go ahead and say the answer to
that i mean it's one of those they
always bait you right
it says not the but the title is
like you sound like kind of a butthole
but let's see here okay let's scroll up
and see and also sol raya thank you for
the gifted subscriptions
my seven i'm 17. my sister 34 called me
saying that her work had an emergency
and she needs to get there asap
she needed me to watch her kids because
no one else can i rushed over there just
to find her husband locked in his game
room playing video games
i asked her why she called me over if he
was home and she said he didn't want to
babysit because it was his only day off
already kind of a bad start um
why people are saying this is me this is
not me at all i
i cut my my gaming hours by like
two-thirds
to be the greatest dad you could ever
expect in your entire life
just because i'm a gamer who's also a
dad doesn't mean i'm ignoring my
fatherly responsibilities i mean do you
not see that i
i got the polo shirt buttoned up to the
top you can't get much more deadly than
that
sister left i started hanging with the
kids i was changing the baby's diaper
and the other kids wanted a snack i told
them to go ask their dad to make them a
snack since the baby had a blowout
and it was gonna take a while to clean
him up well their dad sent them back
upstairs and told them to ask me again
after cleaning the baby up i made the
kids a snack and their dad came out to
eat and told me not to let the kids
interrupt him on his day off okay
very bad um already
obviously not the the the dad
is uh kind of a piece of garbage for
sure at least based on this story
whether it's true or not
i kind of snapped at him and told him it
was my day off too and that he's a
useless effing father
and husband if his wife has to rely on
her teenage sister rather than her own
husband
he started telling me i was
disrespectful and didn't understand how
hard parenting is i told him he clearly
doesn't understand how hard it is either
since he considers parenting his own
children to be babysitting
he ended up kicking me out and
apparently my sister was forced to come
home because he told her she needed to
figure it out since i'm her sister
this is i i don't even have anything to
react to right now because this is like
such a cut and dry situation
um but hey how many levels of iq are you
on
you just kicked out your free babysitter
um because she asked you to like cut up
a mango for
your own kids or something i feel like i
may be the because my sister's
mad at me her husband is mad at me my
mom is mad at me for causing drama my
dad thinks it's funny and agrees with me
based father
based father incoming i definitely
didn't need to call him names but i just
hate this guy so much
we've argued about things in the past my
sister's saying i need to apologize and
he's threatening to never let me into
the kids lives if i keep disrespecting
him
oh man this is pretty bad
uh edit wow i was not expecting this uh
and to the people who message me dick
pics or to kill myself what why
lol y'all are crazy yeah i mean this is
i have
a lot of sympathy for you also welcome
to the internet anytime you make
something that's popular you
uh become a conduit and a lightning rod
for the most insane people that have
ever existed on planet earth
uh unfortunately that's uh i think
that's read it in a nutshell
um for anyone who asked no he does not
take care of the kids normally
my sister takes them to daycare and then
picks them up on her way home
she's the breadwinner and the primary
caretaker
can i tell you um i mean this is a uh
it's a long a story from a long time ago
one time my friend was driving me to
mouse university campus
which is like five hours away and we
picked
up a friend of my drivers
uh and when when we picked him up he was
like dude i gotta get out of my house
my stepdad is in there and uh like
all he does all day is play the game
black on
ps2 so then we we
you know when we picked him up we were
like yeah he's playing black on ps2
the middling first person shooter i
swear to god we drove away
spent the whole weekend at mal's
university house came back and then he
was still playing black on the ps2
like the guy is he was in love with the
game
also is probably like you know at that
point the game was maybe like four years
old
we were deep into the ps3 era
it's the ultimate dad game anyway um
sorry that was i i'd like everybody else
on the internet i took this story as an
opportunity to insert my own
uh much less interesting story that
feels more interesting because it
happened to me instead of to a stranger
this is the easiest question of all time
uh you are not the
for calling your sister's husband
useless that's a gimme
uh and then on top of that uh this guy
does not seem like
a if he exists does not seem like a good
father i mean i'm
i'm his age are there days where i
uh you know and i wake up in the morning
and i'm like oh i don't feel like as
excited about changing diapers today i
don't feel as excited about
you know doing feeding time or bath time
or whatever of course you know
it's a lit there's some drudgery and
sometimes you're like oh i'm desperate
for like a little time for myself
but you know both parents everybody
involved in raising the kid goes through
the exact same
uh situation you're you're all feeling
like you need some time so you gotta
lean on each other you just do it anyway
that's what it means to be a uh
that's what it means to be a good parent
on top of that um i know people are like
it's crazy that people were sending them
um illicit photos because they're
underage
yeah you shouldn't be doing it to begin
with i feel like a lot of people are
maybe focusing on the worst aspect of it
for sure but
i am surprised at how many people in
chat are like holed up they send
nude photos to a 17 year old
you shouldn't do it to begin with that's
kind of like the open and shut case on
that one it's not like well
i did uh send a naked photo of myself to
a stranger because they made a post on
reddit i didn't like but at least they
were
18 in two days you know anyway those
this that's mega bad everything about
this post is mad
or is bad i should say
let's move on to something that maybe
has a little bit more uh
react-ability associated with it let's
see
am i the for ruining my sister's
wedding
yo the music is so legit don't downvote
 by the way
um throwaway account and please don't
repost anywhere else
every time do we have to do this every
single time
i i'm laughing like people always make a
post on like am i the
and then they're like please don't
show this to anybody i just want
everybody on the internet to see it but
do not share it at with anybody else at
all
how about this one am i the for
being surly
rude and mean at a wedding and leaving
early
disclaimer i'm trying to get a tv show
made out of this so please do not
copy i am i the for being surly
rude and mean at a wedding and leaving
early
i was asked to be a member of the
wedding party despite this i was
time to caps lock was uh one sentence
get ready
despite this i was the only person
at the ceremony who was not allowed to
have a plus one
this was an outdoor wedding with
unlimited seating and these people don't
give a
s about covid so it wasn't about that
okay
i feel like this are there edits
involved here i have to wonder
why you were the only person not allowed
to have a plus one
because let um just hear me out here
if you specifically were not allowed to
have a plus one
my question and i don't want to say
hunch
my question is you might have terrible
taste
in partners and maybe a an
ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend has
consistently ruined events that they've
come to but they still like you but
let's see let's see i was told it was
because my relationship wasn't serious
enough despite us being together for a
year that only engaged or married
couples were invited
and that they didn't want some random
guy in their wedding pictures who i
might not even be with later in the
future they don't want to have to look
at some random guy in their photos even
though
he wouldn't have been in any of the post
pictures at all maybe just in the
background of crowd shots
that is that's very funny um
and and almost i mean yeah if you're
if you're having a wedding you know you
you want the people that are at least in
the
the wedding party photos to i guess be
as stable as possible um
but that is it does sound like uh and i
think you should leave post
he's not a guy is bozo bozo's in the
photo
there have been no conflicts between
them and my boyfriend and he's a nice
and mild-mannered guy who gets along
with everyone so i don't think it was
about him personally
i get to the ceremony find out literally
everyone else has a plus one not just
married couples but there are couples
there who have been dating for
less time than me this is when i started
feeling
surly i smiled and played my part during
the ceremony but inside i was very surly
and angry
we then got to the reception which had
way more people than the ceremony
seems of course why i mean the ceremony
is boring
the reception's where all the fun
happens
this is where all the more distant
friends
were invited and everyone there had a
plus one i was literally placed at a
table as the own oh the one single
person
everyone else at the table was a couple
some at the table were other members of
the wedding party but others were random
distant acquaintances
people started asking me where my
boyfriend was and i said i was told he
wasn't invited they asked why and i said
i had no idea
this is where i started letting my
surliness show and started
acting rude and mean because i was
humiliated
um yeah that seems fair and then
i was brought into conversation with the
couple's male friend dean
i was previously told that dean had a
crush on me
and i made it clear i wouldn't be
interested even if i were single even
after that he kept trying to message me
and i ignored him but now the people who
brought me into the conversation were
standing around at us staring and
giggling behind their backs
behind their hands behind their hands
like they thought they were cupid
matchmakers i was
meaner to dean than i've ever been to
anyone else in my entire life
oh sorry i need to scroll down a little
if you'll excuse me
i was meaner to dean than i've ever been
to anyone in my entire life
i was as fully rude as i've ever wanted
to be when the target of someone's
when being the target of someone's
romantic interest unwantedly it's true i
don't really know if i was being set up
but i was already furious before that
happened
um yeah you're not obviously not the
can i tell you i the only reason you
would be the is for posting this
when you're so obviously not the
i'm i feel baited into reading this post
for there to be any kind of like meat on
the bone to
talk about when in reality it's so
obviously
like you're not the and
everybody else is a piece of garbage
here
that you you kind of become maybe not
the but maybe like
a small jerk small jerk energy s-s-j-e
um i do want us oh i i need to i need to
open the comments in the future
if dean wasn't in on the plan then it's
not okay to be mean to him
um yeah
okay i mean that's true we we can't
suggest
necessarily that uh dean was in on this
we don't know
um but then again dean made it clear he
wouldn't be interested
or i wouldn't be interested even if i
were single but he kept trying to
message me
i don't know it sounds like he was kind
of creeping i don't have an answer for
you here that is anything that is
that is even mildly controversial
sounds like dean was a little bit suss
yeah also how was dean there
by himself if everybody had a plus one
it really a little bit of an unreliable
narrator perhaps
and it says literally everyone there had
a plus one
maybe dean's creeping or maybe not
literally everybody there had a plus one
who knows
don't lie to me dean let me see if i can
find one
oh i i love i was gonna say i love these
because the the title was am i the
 for banning my mother-in-law
from my house but then it literally
starts with like a
very tragic story we gotta find some
for some i am the
i gotta scroll so much just to see the
first one oh
no okay here we go this is
am i the maybe we'll sort by
rising a little later today as well
am i the for telling my partner
that my stepson spends too much time at
our home and his mother needs to make
more of an effort
everyone sucks okay i'm
i'm excited already okay i've been
dating this guy now for nearly eight
months
we've been living together for two
everything was going great we're like
best friends
we had hey let me just start by saying
everything was going great followed by
a 13 000 upvote everybody sucks here am
i the post is a little bit
was everything going great especially i
mean
it seems like it's been
i don't know you know what i'm not gonna
give relationship advice because what do
i know
we're best friends we have so much in
common his four-year-old son is now
proving to be a bit of a strain on our
relationship and i feel like i can't
take him anywhere
no really a four-year-old kid being a
little bit of a
strain on your relationship that scene
come on this kids they honestly it
sounds like the kid kind of sucks here
what's that oh let me all feed me feed
me teach me things play with me come on
man
can you can't even go out to the club
there's they kick out miners at like 9
p.m
his son throws tantrums slams doors when
he doesn't get what he wants
smashing the glass on my sister's door
when we buy him things he says i didn't
want that or i don't like it
when we take him to a store he picks up
everything i i just need to kind of stop
already and say is
the way you're describing like you're
writing this post
to get ready to judge your
four-year-olds even if they are your
stepchild is a little bit of uh
it's a weird energy like you're writing
you're not just like they behave badly
you're writing an essay that's like
please start to dislike my child yo dan
thank you for the raid
this is you could weigh in on this one
dan the the title of this post is am i
the
 for telling my partner that my
stepson spends too much time at our
house and his mother needs to make more
of an effort
so they're four-year-old oh they're just
they're honestly it sounds like their
four-year-old's kind of the here
he picks up everything he sees and
throws tantrums when he doesn't get them
spits his food out when we cook for him
tells us he doesn't like us
making my seven-year-old niece cry when
he says horrible things to her as well
as throwing her things
off of our balcony etc he's a nightmare
let me just add that his dad always has
to buy him new toys every time he takes
him out which i told him he shouldn't
his mother is now treating us like a
daycare she had him for one day last
week
and having him for two next week while
she goes on holiday with her new
boyfriend and going out with friends
okay you've said the stage look you
might be going a little bit
over top over the top here with the
insults to your four-year-old stepchild
however
you know you got to put yourself in the
in the four-year-old shoes as well
you know that there are only four and
they are already living with like a new
mother figure like of course they're
they're acting out a little bit
plus they're four my partner is now
currently unemployed and i'm the main
breadwinner and struggling to support
all three of us do to have to buying
doing due to having to buy extra food
and more gas and electric usage
this is something that i always end up
looking
uh maybe a little bit
like i'm in a bubble on this because i
electricity is pretty
cheap where i live the idea that like i
mean if you added like an extra
four-year-old to your electric bill i
have to imagine that it
over here would probably be like 20 a
month
you give the kid a bath every other day
and i
i don't even know like what are they
using the ipad all the time
kids obviously not stoked yeah they mine
in bitcoins your four-year-old mine and
bitcoins on their little
microsoft surface yo spinning machine
thanks
for the gifted subs thank you
sorry sorry
more gas and electric usage i'm also
woken up at 7am every saturday and
sunday because my stepson wants the ipad
charging or more games downloading when
weekends are supposed to be my time
after working all day monday to friday i
don't finish until 8pm
this is something i have some sympathy
for but i also just have to say that
that's like
that's what what you get when you have
kids like when you're
in your 20s you don't have kids i guess
it doesn't have to be in your 20s
when you work five six days a week you
get to be a little bit more protective
of your day off
uh when you are in an arrangement where
you're also taking care of a child the
child's interests uh
take precedent over you whether you got
to get up at 7 a.m or otherwise
i told my partner this has to stop and
my place cannot be treated like a
daycare he needs to either take him out
weekends or rotate it so we have him
every other weekend
i feel like my life has been taken over
as well as my apartment as his son has
his own bedroom and my things have been
taken out of drawers and placed in
plastic bags which i'm now living out of
i need more information about this as
well this what
i don't understand what the why your
stuff has been taken out of drawers and
placed into plastic bags
i mean
be that as it may uh my partner is
struggling being away from his son and i
feel horrible for giving him ultimatums
but i feel i need to look after myself
too as i did
as i never did in my last relationship i
suffer from depression and anxiety i
feel this whole situation is making
things worse
am i the well
uh my let's look at the edits first okay
i'm not trying to stop my partner from
seeing his son i'm merely implying the
kid needs
routine and equal time with both mom and
dad on rotating days in which my partner
also agrees
i know they come as a package and i'm
willing to take this on but neither
parent is financially supporting this
child
okay i think that i i agree with the
flair that everybody sucks here imo
uh you're it it sounds like based on the
post
your boyfriend should take a more
uh serious role in raising
his own son especially like uh
you know you are in a relationship with
somebody that has a kid that's gonna
change your life for sure
but you have also only been dating for
eight months like expecting your
girlfriend of eight months to be such a
dependable mother figure for your child
who is super young and
perhaps has some behavioral issues is a
little bit of an move for sure
you know it's gonna it's gonna take some
time to adjust to that for
for everybody involved um
i have no idea what's going on with the
the birth mother so i mean it sounds
like the the birth mother is painted in
a very negative
light here but maybe she's been watching
the kid like crazy
for a year and now she's going on
vacation for a week after
two years of the pandemic you know that
doesn't make her a bad mother
necessarily if there's other
if there's the infrastructure in place
for other people to watch
apart from that i'm like i the only
reason that i'm like
she's kind of a an is a result
of the fact that
she just dedicates like an entire
paragraph to the four-year-old being
badly behaved and i'm like yeah they're
four
my baby shits her pants
two times a day when i try to change her
diaper she rolls around and making it
that much harder to clean no matter how
many times i tell her
stop rolling she keeps rolling am i the
for saying stop crapping your pants like
it's a little kid
but i i do i will say i this is like the
second post this week
already hold on i'm just opening the the
comments here i always want to see if
there's some spiciness but
um that's the second comment this week
that was like uh
you know i get one day off and i'm
so sick of having the seven days a week
care about a child and i'm like i get
that it's not
your biological kid but it's a package
deal in the relationship
that's what having a kid is like you
know seven days a week
you got to do some kid related
responsibilities you know you don't get
hey i worked till eight last night honey
can you just like you know
cook yourself lunch she's four years old
she can't even you know hit the knobs
on the on the stove anyway scroll down
for the update
oh you guys couldn't oh sorry sorry
update my partner has landed himself a
job we've had to talk about his son's
behavior my partner decided to stop
spoiling him
and reward him only for good behavior my
partner is also going to speak to his ex
about the lack of time she's spending
with him
found out the few days she does have him
she's taking him to her mom's and
leaving him there
look again it's good it's good that you
communicated all right
that's what i'm going to say about that
i am going to say that the update
certainly appears to take absolutely no
responsibility
and also i would like to hear about
things from the uh
the mother's side but
[Laughter]
because it's it she's like a fringe
character in this whole story
where we're like uh you know i hate that
lady
that has been described by her
ex-husband's
new girlfriend as being such a selfish
 anyway
um everybody sucks here your house isn't
being treated like a daycare it's being
treated like the home of a child's
parent you're in a relationship with a
parent you need to come to terms with
the fact that he might wind up
with his kid full time or you need to
not be in a relationship with a parent
little kids get up early and if that
bothers you you shouldn't be living with
the kid and his parent
not at all reasonable to tell the child
to tell the parent the child needs to
not exist in your space
yeah that seems fair
your partner sucks are putting you in a
position where you're living out of bags
in your own home
i i do wish that you would also have
told me
um why why the bags i don't under like
they took
your adult stuff out of the drawers to
put the child's
uh stuff into the drawers i'm not
saying this is a situation where maybe
you just buy another chest of drawers i
just gotta know why it's in bags
like do you do you live in like uh is
your house
half submerged with like ankle high
water where you can't just put stuff on
the ground
i don't i don't understand but anyway
one of these days we'll figure it out no
questions about the bags please
colorectal surgeon that's how you know
like they got their head screwed on
straight
here's the thing he's not gonna change
this is how he parents this is how he
deals with his ex
you've been dating less than a year and
this guy already has you supporting him
you're feeling mental health effects
you're struggling financially
looking after yourself is the correct
choice the way you're doing it is not
okay
okay so that's a very nice way for him
to say uh
either tell your boyfriend to shape up
or break up i think
but i feel like a lot of these posts are
like just break up
um and hey i don't think that's fair to
say that he's not gonna change
you know i i feel like maybe you did the
best assumption
is that he's not gonna change and you
should you know maybe operate
under that assumption but simultaneously
i'm like that's a little rude to the
boyfriend yeah plus the update says he
promised that he would whether or not he
actually will who knows but still
all right well at least we got some meat
on that one i can always respect the
little meat
hold on i'm i'm looking for more oh oh
this is
oh this is good stuff
things are getting spicy
love the music too man just adds another
extra element
am i the for telling my friend
her birthday is annoying
my 19 year old friend my i'm 19 my
friend's
birthday my it just doesn't roll off the
tongue very well
poster is 19 friend is 18. my friend
celebrates her birthday for an entire
week every year
she grew up really spoiled and still is
to be honest and she says it's normal
her reasoning is that she has too many
friends so she can't see them all in the
same day and she doesn't want to mix her
friend groups for a big party
so she just goes out with everyone
separately for an entire week
how many times has this happened if
she's only 18
i mean from zero to like
six the birthday parties are basically
just like come over eat some dairy queen
ice cream cake and then from like six
until
12 nobody's going out and like oh i
gotta i'm having
seven birthday parties or something like
 this only happened like a few times
i'm not jealous or anything but it's
ridiculous
she'll basically i'm not jealous or
anything but it's ridiculous
she'll basically be unavailable that
entire week because she has to
see everyone also she acts like a
princess all the time but it's
especially prominent during
birthday week on her b day like that
actual day
she even wears one of those blingy
tiaras as part of her outfit
she was definitely one of those girls
that brings balloons to her
to school on her birthday it sounds like
you hate this person and you should not
be friends
so i mean literally at no point have you
mentioned any positivity in your
relationship
anything that enhances you know the
quality of life for either of you
it's just uh are you being forced under
under threat of incarceration to be
friends i don't understand
also she posts instagram stories to
thank
everyone for their gifts and time like
we don't care your dad got you a car
or whatever and she gets upset if
someone she thought she was close with
forgets her birthday she won't lash out
or tell them anything
but she'll be like wow so-and-so forgot
anyways all this is really childish
sometimes you hit the nail on the head
and i told her that her birthday week is
extremely childish and annoying and that
i won't be participating
and she said it's fine but stopped
replying to my texts or answering my
calls to hang out i think she's upset
even though she tried to pass it off as
it's fine read it am i the
okay and then here's your update
the problem i apostrophe s because her
birthday
that i'm not even mad about this this is
an auto correct situation where like
we're now at a point where autocorrect
um
suggests incorrect spellings rather than
the correct spelling more than it
actually helps you out so i'm gonna
blame the phone for this
the problem is because her birthday is
always over the top and everyone makes a
huge deal oh it's her name's birthday
next week we better be obnoxious and not
shut up about it
also if gifts don't matter to her why is
she posting about it rather than
thanking the people in private or over
text
wow i forgot what it was like
to have uh no real problems in your life
maybe that's judgmental but i i
i'm being teleported backwards into like
my teenage years
and when you would be preoccupied with
like
nothing you would think you would obsess
for hours about absolutely nothing
as if it was the largest deal of all
time
um you're definitely the
your friend's uh birthday
is who cares i mean like
i know that so i do see some people
saying like everybody sucks here
you can dislike her friend because like
it sounds like she's
rich and her friend her dad is buying
her a car but like
this she's 18 years old what do you like
what do you want her to do don't
if if you got a car if you're 18 years
old you got a car you might post a tweet
or an instagram uh
story or something and be like you know
thanks for the car
you're you're a teenager
now that i'm you know in my 30s if
somebody gave me an expensive gift i
would never tell anybody
because i'm trying not to make myself a
target for you know
robberies and muggings but as a teenager
you're you know you're flexing you're
trying to establish your identity
she's 18 years old she's basically a
child is i guess what i'm trying to say
um but the way that the the amount of
offense that op
is taking to her supposed friend
uh celebrating her birthday too much
this is the kind of thing you think
about and maybe you talk about
in the group chat uh but you definitely
don't go like
hey we're friends right so i can tell
you anything uh the way you celebrate
your birthday is extremely childish and
annoying and i won't be participating
definitely makes you uh the
mod post first off explore new criminal
possibilities in red dead online by the
way
all with no upfront investment necessary
play now
locked because quite frankly i want to
enjoy my weekend
reddit mods everywhere have they have
the same energy
you're the it sounds like your
friend isn't intentionally hurting
anyone
she might even be trying to accommodate
everyone by spacing out different means
of celebrating her birthday across a
week so everyone could get more
personalized
time with her look i'm gonna tell you my
hunch is that her friend is spoiled and
maybe a little bit
uh hungry for attention and i think that
this person is replying and being very
generous and optimistic but
they are also 18 years old and who cares
you know just just because it sounds
like her friend's a little bit hungry
for attention that doesn't mean
uh you know she's a bad person
how you attempt to justify your
perception that she acts like a princess
comes down to her seemingly being
excited about turning a new age
and maybe having a big personality it
seems like your friend's way of
celebrating what she considers a
significant event and how she expresses
herself isn't for you and that's okay
yet it can be rude and unexpected to
push your judgments on her
about a birthday that doesn't have to
concern you if you don't want to do it
if you don't want it to do so all in all
her birthday week isn't about you and
it's not supposed to be she's worthy of
all the kinds of celebrations she
desires rather than the lack thereof you
want for her
what the hell are you talking about
you're right but why
bold this is such live laugh love energy
like maybe i'm the now
but the fact that it's bold and
italicized
on top of the actual wording involved
here
what do you mean she's worthy of the
celebration she desires you don't know
who this lady is
couldn't you just say it's her like
it's her birthday you know it doesn't
concern you i don't know why you've
turned it into some kind of
you know mantra but anyway
i mean this is just i'm just surprised
could have taken that one back to the
drawing board um i'm just seeing oh my
god it's it's fostered a lot of
discussion that's for sure
you're the you do sound jealous
it's one week a year you don't even have
to be a part of it
since she's basically unavailable for
the week you don't have to participate
so just send your gift bow out of events
and temporarily hide her on social media
it's not that big of a deal let her
enjoy her birthday yeah
exactly why do you care
it also does not sound like they're uh
like they're friends okay that was a
good one dude the the
i am the ones are they're so
much more entertaining
i some of these i like when the
thumbnail or the the title
doesn't lie to you maybe yeah we'll get
some gray area questions going later if
we can
like filter by controversial maybe
because i'm trying to think
normally on reddit when you filter by
controversial
it's actually like just the worst
you'll ever see in your life
i feel like on a subreddit designed to
make judgments
filtering by controversial might
actually give you the highest quality
posts but i might be
uh i might be incorrect
we'll see either way okay this one is a
guarantee
am i the for being shot that my
friend will get married before me
i have this friend let's call her jane
because her name's jane
we're in our mid-30s now but we were
roommates since freshman year of college
she's one of my closest friends and i
know her super well
and i know that for oliver 20 she had
horrendous luck with her love life and
was extremely
insecure about it she always wanted to
get married and have kids kept ending up
with douchebags who would cheat on her
or
man who straight up didn't like her
daddy issues
and crying about it and i was always
there for her through it and reassuring
her how she won't die alone
but her love life kind of became a punch
line i was always
there for her telling her she's not
gonna die alone
that being said her love life was a
little bit of a punch line in our group
of friends
everyone was there she laughed about it
too she had a fun time
oh that's so good sometimes she'd go
along with it especially once she got
into her 30s and was still single
she'd say like haha yeah guys we all
know i'm gonna die alone all the time
and i know she was torn up about it but
we were always reassuring her that it's
not the case and she was in therapy
about it
oh oh that sentence is so
let me try again but her love life kind
of became a punchline in our group of
friends and sometimes she'd go along
with it especially once she got into her
30s and was still single
she'd say like haha yeah guys we all
know i'm gonna die alone all the time
and i know she was torn up about it but
we were always reassuring her that it's
not the case and she was in therapy
about it
anyways about a year ago she finally met
an incredible man and they fell in love
almost instantly
he proposed to her last week and she's
just completely over the moon i've never
seen her this happy
this weekend we all went out to
celebrate and all our friends were
saying how we're so happy for her after
a long and difficult road
it was really emotional for context i'm
single
no boyfriend and i want to get married
too but i'm not a pathology
like she was
and so i said i can't believe jane will
get married before me she started crying
and stormed out and the evening was
completely spoiled i tried calling her
this weekend but she was hysterical
and said that i didn't have to point out
that she's so unlovable and it's a
miracle she tricked someone into
proposing
jane jane have you not have you
forgotten
about the fact that your love life is a
punchline in our group
jane come on jane have you forgotten
about how we always used to make fun of
you for
that the fact that you wouldn't ever get
married and you die alone and then we
were like i'm just kidding
have you forgotten about all the fun
jokes we had about you
living alone for the rest of your life
it's quite sad dot dot dot but that's
not what i meant that's her own baggage
that's
i'm not a pathology like she was by the
way i apologize but also suggested she
should talk to her therapist
hey i'm sorry if my joke offended you
have you ever considered uh that your
reaction might be
something you take up with a mental
health professional because i don't
think that i did anything wrong
uh and now she completely refuses to
speak to me and won't answer my messages
a couple others in our friend group are
on her side
well some have said that she's
overreacting and will come around am i
the
wow this is um pretty bad uh
like not the no people in chat are like
it's the worst person i've ever seen
she's not a war criminal um
but maybe that's because she hasn't had
the opportunity
to be yet in such a small like domestic
social situation she's already proven
herself a
bad judge of character i would say just
to begin with so
for anybody you know that's treating
this as instructive rather than merely
why would we suggest op is the
in this situation
look it
is the start of this is a little
complicated the end is very simple okay
the first thing i would say is you gotta
when you make jokes with your friends
about things that they're actually
sensitive about
you gotta you know be very very careful
okay like even with close friends like
mouth and i will banter
we'll make fun of each other there's
things that i would
you know take more offense to mouth
making fun of me for not baldness for
example i don't know but something else
and there's things that might hurt mouse
feelings that i could say
and you just the the spirit of
friendship is like
bantering but also knowing that you know
you shouldn't cross that line
and it kind of sounds like uh
you know jane for names have been
changed to protect the innocent
uh how has a complex about the fact that
she thought she was gonna die alone
based on the fact that she was actually
in therapy
uh about it and yet you and the rest of
your friends treating it as a punchline
pretty bad that's that that's already
like
at the very least a bit of a spicy gray
area
um then
when she's happy to be like i can't
believe
jane got married before me is
really bad when all you have to do is
not make it about you
and instead be like congratulations
like how hard is that and then just have
a good night and then
the the triple down is like i respect it
but also
it's horrible when she said uh
i kind of apologize but also i suggested
you should talk to your therapist about
it
i don't need i i mean sometimes i'll
make a joke someone will take real
offense to it
and i want in my head i'm like oh come
on you baby
maybe you should talk to your therapist
about it but you never say it out loud
you just go
i'm sorry i didn't think about the that
what i said would affect your feelings
like that
you know it's not that's part of like
what it's like to be
an adult and have friends is you you
spend some time
apologizing for things that you think
the other person's overreacting about
but they're reacting that way because
it's like about their feelings
instead of you know about yours like her
feelings are
hurt because of what you said and then
your feelings are hurt because of the
fact
that her feelings are hurt like who's
who's in the wrong there i think that's
an easy one
anyway yeah so she's like the super
 no question
um wow major you're the here
sounds like there's some jealousy going
on that jane is getting married while
you're still single
her love life should never have been a
punch line you and your friends
contributed to her insecurities who
responds to a proposal like this
wouldn't be surprised if jane cuts you
off altogether
agreed this this user was awarded
reddit gold for this post wholesome
award
so much this up dudes to the left
my gentle sir but then
i do like that on am i the
people like go for the jugular vein
who knows maybe op's disgusting attitude
is the reason men don't find her
attractive
oh i'm sure of it no one likes a bitter
jealous
bully like that
she was rude for sure in her comments
at the same time that's a little over
the top
it's the classic like internet thing
right where like someone makes
uh behaves badly in public or they
engages in like a social faux pas
and people are like yeah they should be
killed maybe i think
and everyone's like so true 1.7 000
upvotes
anyway people have suggested go to
am i the filtered and that is
like the
that's got the best posts let's see
there's so much this



am i the [ __ ] filtered only the most
interesting am i the [ __ ] posts there
we go now we can get into some
discussions
only the most interesting i don't want
cut in dry situations
i want it to be like i i want to have
some people
get upset and disagree with me even
though i'm right
uh but then i do look at the top post
here and it says am i the [ __ ] for
calling a pregnant woman an incubator
and refusing to talk to her
[Laughter]
i will also say um as i
as i open this up here i have an ad
is the weirdest ad i've ever seen
it's time stay connected with floyd
money mayweather himself on
only fans
is that what that website's for
also is that what floyd mayweather is
doing now
[Laughter]
do i am i mistaken on
on what the website is is for maybe yes
maybe no
it also gave me a hello fresh ad so
things are all uh
all out of whack right now maybe it's my
my wife's way of
telling me that my cooking isn't up to
snuff
anyway am i the [ __ ] for calling a
pregnant woman
an incubator and refusing to talk to her
let's find out
i 23 year old non-binary visited my
family this summer
my this is so long oh my god
[Laughter]
my family and i are all vaccinated so my
parents wanted to hold a small
fourth of july gathering i can already
tell where this
is going strap in okay this is a little
this is getting a little spicy my family
and i are all vaccinated so my parents
wanted to hold a small fourth of july
gathering
unfortunately a couple who are openly
homophobic transphobic and sexist was
also invited
i came out to my parents as non-binary
and bisexual last summer but they don't
really understand
lgbtq identities due to language
barriers
however i was hoping that coming out to
them would encourage them to cut ties
from this couple
okay so this is like you can't pick your
family
and this is already uh a tangled web
that's being woven here
lo and behold the two showed up at the
fourth of july gathering the woman
proceeded to ask nonstop about when i
will be getting a boyfriend so my
parents can have grandchildren
she firmly bases her whole identity
around being a mother
she has three kids and is currently
pregnant with another and kept talking
about how if i wait too long i'll lose
the chance to be a mother
she also implied that women's sole
purpose is to birth and raise the next
generation and that women who work are
selfish i became frustrated and blurted
out
good thing i'm not a woman and that i
don't ever want kids
she froze for a second kind of looked me
up and down trying to see if i was
obviously transitioning and then left
okay this is the kind of thing where
you're like
it's it's not my ideal of a good
fourth of july
[Laughter]
feels like this would probably be a
situation where you may be uh start
having your own
uh gatherings and celebrations if this
is gonna keep happening
i was left alone for a couple minutes
until the couple all came
to confront me i reiterated i was
non-binary don't ask me about children
that seems
completely fair then the woman tried to
argue with me
so i turned to her husband and asked him
why is your baby incubator still trying
to talk to me doesn't it have something
else to be doing
uh honestly kind of based
it's maybe not quite at the same level
of uh
the watermelon ass come back but
if it's real that's it's a little based
everyone heard me say that who hurried
and
including my parents who hurried over to
see what was going on
i told them what happened i was tired of
being bothered by their friends then i
left
after that the party fizzled out yeah i
know what you're saying there
you're like not only did i drop a sick
comeback
but when i left the party fizzled
if i'm not there it's dead
i saw the way you snuck that in there is
not only did i own them
but i also killed the party on the way
out
my parents tried to apologize on my
behalf but the couple left almost
immediately and everyone else just
trickled out because it was awkward
previously the woman has talked about
how women should remain silent when
there are men
talking so my reasoning is that i was
simply using her own beliefs against her
i mean it's if it's a shower come back
it's a shower come back but
i mean she's kind of she's got her there
if this really happened
she she used the woman's own reasoning
against her
she pulled the ben shapiro on her
without a doubt
my mother thinks that i'm the [ __ ]
for coming out during a party instead of
keeping the peace when i know they are
lgbtq phobic
i would say that that is a pretty
invalid reason
calling the woman an incubator may be a
little rude
simultaneously though a little based
sorry they
is my mistake
calling the woman an incubator
simultaneously
while rude
kind of an own stressing a pregnant
woman out
literally you can't take responsibility
for that take it from me
they get stressed out over everything
oh oh there's no dill pickle ice cream
left over
oh this uh little baby inside of my
stomach is kicking all my organs around
all the time
like you you can't help but stress him
out from time to time now i mean just
getting into a
verbal altercation it's a little bit
different story but
causing her to lose a friend my sister
thinks the incubator comment was
hilarious but thinks i'm an [ __ ] for
calling the woman an it
i don't want to misgender people but it
was the best way to get my point across
to someone who thinks women are property
i don't know what to say about that one
but uh i mean
it sounds like your sister is on the
same level from a humorous standpoint at
least as you are
after a couple of days of fierce
arguments in my parents house i returned
home but my parents keep blowing up my
phone
i do think she deserved it and it was
the best way to get them to stop talking
to me i don't want to apologize am i the
[ __ ]
um so this
is i i like this thread
okay you know why because it's spicy
it's controversial my immediate hunch
after reading this is not the [ __ ]
it's if we take the story of face value
it seems like
you tried to make it known you were not
comfortable with the discussion that was
happening
you maybe even specifically said please
stop bringing that up to me
then they wouldn't and you know they
appeared at least from your perception
to be rude at which point
you delivered a nuclear level insults
that the person that was the
architect of this you know interaction
to begin with
can't even argue with because it used
their own logic against them
so i i'm big into the not the [ __ ]
camp here
it sounds like you you laid the
groundwork said please stop talking to
me about this
and then you know defeated them with
facts and logic
although i appreciate the support of
everyone who said i was not the [ __ ]
oh no now i'm there they're going to
turn the tables on me
after some reflection and reading
through this threat i've decided to
apologize to my parents for the blow up
but not apologize to the couple
based and reality pill i accept that i
was an [ __ ]
even if justified i recognize how my
comments could have caused others to
feel bad about pregnancy or family
without context and there was probably a
better way to handle the situation
i was already dealing with other
situations at the time and it just
exploded out of me
taking the high road was the last thing
on my mind after dealing with similar
incidents politely in the past
not the [ __ ] at all like this just
very reasonable sounds like you're
bringing much more decorum to this than
than the older couple did in the first
place you know that this is just a very
normal way to respond to this
the final verdict is everyone sucks
not the [ __ ] 54 percent
everybody sucks here 37 you're the
[ __ ] eight percent
i don't i don't know why the verdict is
everybody sucks here then i feel like
that's uh
they gotta work on their algorithm but
popular vote lost again yeah it was it
did those those dang
swing states man florida voted for
everybody sucks here
stop the count oh dude this is so much
better
like these ones that are a little bit
spicy inevitably
one day it's gonna lead to some
controversy and i'm gonna be annoyed and
kill this segment forever
however for the time being i love it
am i the [ __ ] for telling my friend's
wife to eat a salad
probably
maybe she was just hungry
my wife has a friend that she's had
since high school in high school they
were both around 105 pounds
i'm sure that this is what
your wife has told you but it's just
very
weird knowledge uh to
know how much your wife's friend weighed
in high school
that is i have no information about
what any of my wife's friends weigh to
begin with but the fact that they uh
know what they weighed in high school
and have used that in the first sentence
is a little much
anyway just just strange energy from the
start however since then the friend has
gained an
excessive amount of weight and is closer
to 200 to 215
what are you like one of those guys at
the fair that guesses how much someone
weighs just by looking at them
my wife is very health-conscious and
always works out so even though she's in
her mid-30s she still looks around 19-20
and is very toned in fit and weighs only
around 120 pounds
why is it it's so
so much focus on the numbers so far
i like i just don't know why
you have to point out that your wife
looks like she's 19 to 20 anyway
anytime her friend sees her she makes
comments about my wife being too skinny
and she needs to eat
uh glory gear it bothers my wife and
pisses me off when she does this
well we moved across the country years
ago so she only deals with it every
couple years when she comes to visit
well the last time she was here she
wasted no time busting out the
blurred gear comments after we picked
her up from the airport we stopped for
lunch as soon as
we sat down she pointed to the poor gear
section and told my wife she should
order something from there
as soon as she said it i pointed out
that they have several salad options and
she should really
consider ordering one now everyone is
pissed am i the [ __ ]
okay you don't look at the you don't
look at the results yet you gotta give
your own opinion first
okay um
i do think
and i think this is where we might get
into some disagreement
i think op is the [ __ ]
to be honest now are they
out of line are they wrong
i don't know that's a little bit more uh
that's not the question right the
question is
are they an [ __ ] what's an [ __ ]
you know kind of going over the top with
a
hay maker when when you're in public and
you're you're talking with your friends
you kind of just jab a little bit
you know you you don't go for the the
knockout that ends somebody's career you
just kind of try to
wound their pride slightly and then you
know make a joke at your own expense as
well
if you and here's the thing
i feel like maybe the husband or the op
in this situation is like
my wife keeps talking to me
about how annoying it is that her friend
keeps telling her to eat a burger
however
it probably is worse for your wife
that now you've made a joke at her
friend's
expense so now the whole situation is
awkward
whereas what could have happened instead
is you just go
ah no i think i'm just gonna get a salad
she eats a burger and then you go home
and go that was fun
i do wish you stopped talking about the
burger stuff though
but i feel like there's a better way to
solve this problem
um you you kind of got you got
needled a little bit just a little
needling
and then you replied with like a
hydrogen bomb so i think
i think that they're the [ __ ]
not a major [ __ ] issue but i i think
they're the [ __ ]
um but i do have to say
the final verdict
not the [ __ ] 45 everybody sucks here
42
you're the [ __ ] 10 what the heck is
oh
nah is no [ __ ] of course there'd be
zero percent
there's gotta be an [ __ ] i do think
that this
look i i can't necessarily suggest that
i have data to back this up
but i think that my hunch is that given
the
demographics of reddit uh
a guy landing
what they perceive to be a justified
ribbing at someone's weight
especially his wife's friend probably
inflates these numbers a little bit
whereas in real life i feel like we'd
probably be a little bit
honestly i'm surprised that there's only
10
of people that are like you're the
[ __ ]
am i like the only well no i'm i'm part
of the 10
i guess but i didn't think that the
proportion of people that was
that understand this is so low at home
you
[ __ ] about everything i don't like this
i don't like that
hey yo i had a great time at dinner did
you notice what they ordered really and
then they scraped the stuff off what did
they do
you don't get to and then like the fact
that you talk about that stuff in the
privacy of your
own home is one thing um but then to go
out and be like hey how about you stop
scraping the lettuce off your burger
you know like that's just you don't have
to bring up every minor grievance that
you have with everybody else
you know you gotta you gotta keep some
social decorum going i'm i'm realizing
now that i'm
and all the other thing is that you're
the [ __ ] thing here it's just the way
he
i don't see why it matters that his wife
looks like she's 19 to 20.
i just find it an unnecessary
uh comment that is
a normal unnecessary comment would be
one thing but it's just weird that he
that he brings it up
it's like my wife who looks 19 by the
way
she looks 19 by the way and she only
weighs about 120 pounds
she only weighs about 120 pounds
anyway um this guy's got triples of the
nova
for sure no question
no i'm doing react court
okay
triples of the nova um
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our
house cleaner to clean her house
three days before her due date when she
needs the money
the other thing about these am i the
[ __ ] filtered posts
is like they're so specific as to be
very real
[Laughter]
it's like normally you wouldn't be like
uh
some of them are like am i the [ __ ]
for uh punching a racist in the face and
you're like no of course not
and then these are like am i the [ __ ]
for making a left turn
on an amber light when the car in front
of me was slow to go through
and also it was raining on the and
you're like okay
you come here here come your eyes
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our
house cleaner to clean our they're also
so much shorter sometimes
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our
house cleaner to clean our house three
days before her due date when she needs
the money
you know what's funny is that just
looking at this to begin with
i would have said not the [ __ ]
absolutely not
um when we had our first kid but seeing
how much more casual sips was about
having his third kid
and he was just like he played rocket
league on monday and then garlic on
tuesday and then like
wednesday at 1 a.m they had the kid i'm
like you know what maybe i was uh
a little bit maybe i was like a little
bit more uh
prepared for the baby than you
necessarily have to be but
i think that's just how it goes for the
firstborn anyway
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our
house cleaner to clean our house three
days before her due date when she needs
the money
sometimes our so hires a cleaning
service for our home
the woman who owns it is in her third
trimester and is due in five days
she was supposed to come today but she
texted us tonight apologizing because
she was in the hospital the cleaner is
asking if she can come to work on
saturday
my significant other wants to take her
up on this but i'm vehemently against it
at the end of the day it's the cleaners
decision on what she wants to do
and she has to do what is best for her
family i just don't feel right hiring
her to work so close to her due date out
of concern for her health
have considered the idea of paying in
advance but that feels awkward
edit we'll add that she does come with
help
so she would not be alone to clean um
i have no idea
you know what i i actually i i stole
this from chad but i think you're right
um i think this is no [ __ ]
i think this is a no [ __ ] present
situation
uh i also
would feel weird about someone cleaning
my house when they were three days
before their due date
it's not really like it's already
awkward
to begin with when you have somebody
else clean your house because you're
like either we're gonna leave or we're
gonna stay there
and i always feel like like they're
judging me for
not helping to begin with but even
though that's not the way it's supposed
to go
so then add in the fact that the woman
is 39.5 weeks out of 40 pregnant
like you're really gonna just sit on the
couch
while uh well a woman that's three days
away from having a baby
cleans your whole house
[Laughter]
i don't think so that would make me
uncomfortable so i don't think the guy
is necessarily the [ __ ] for that
situation
that's and i'm saying that not even like
because of the fact that you know she
could go into labor in your house like
you know
i mean if her water broke while she was
cleaning up
she's already got the mop out so if
anything you're kind of getting two
birds stoned at once
moving on um that being said
i the only i i relate to this comment
however
it's very funny to me have considered
the idea of paying in advance but that
just feels awkward
and i don't think it's that awkward i
think you just
pay her the advance and then move on
like if she needs the money especially
you know you got a relationship with
the cleaning service like it's not
awkward just hey here's your payment
and then you'll get me back when you
like it what it actually sounds like is
you're worried if you give her the
advance that she's going to be like
psych you're never gonna see me again
but uh this is just i there's not that
much meat on the bone here
it's just uh
i mean i just get i i know what i'm
at the road i'm going down here but just
give her the advance
she wants to work three days before the
due date
because she wants the money not because
she's like i'm so
passionate that even having a bowling
ball
inside of my abdomen is not gonna stop
me right it's not like she's doing it
for the love of the game
so just pay her the advance and she'll
get you back
like six weeks later or something like
that it's like
it's i feel like the world is the
[ __ ]
for her feeling compelled to do it to
begin with but
you should i think you pay i think you
came up to your solution you know you
just you just pay the advance here
take me back am i the [ __ ] for asking
my girlfriend not to rub her hairy leg
against me when i'm in bed
oh this one's got it you can tell to
begin with this one's gonna be good
because the headline is so vague there's
no way this person is not the [ __ ] am
i the [ __ ] for refusing to
inconvenience myself over someone else's
problem
most of the posts are like you know am i
the [ __ ] for punching somebody in the
face and then when they add context
you're like
not the [ __ ] this one is like
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to
inconvenience myself over someone else's
problem
you know this is this is gonna be [ __ ]
man
okay here we go
recently i moved into a new flat with a
friend we've looked into renting a flat
specifically with the balcony because we
are both smokers
to be honest i'd probably be okay with
smoking in my room
okay um
that i don't think that's like why
they you have to get a balcony is
because you're not okay with smelling
the smoke that you make
i think it's because you know be
be that as it may about how chad feels
about landlords i think they're more
like
you know we don't want the curtains to
turn yellow regardless
i roll my own cigarettes mcbaron choice
if anyone's interested
anyone that don't have any horrid smell
but usually landlords forbid this and i
don't want to risk it
the flat is on a second flood out of
four
that's going to be important though i
guess just in a way that it's not the
last floor
you're kind of the [ __ ] for thinking
that your cigarettes don't stink
and i don't mean that to be
super anti-smoking but i don't think
i've ever walked by somebody smoking a
cigarette
and been like wow that's good what is
that lemon pound cake
for two months everything was good and
dandy but yesterday i've had my first
encounter with our upstairs neighbor
i went for a smoke after coming home
from work around 2am and as i'm standing
on my balcony
enjoying my last siggy of the day i hear
someone going
good evening can you not smoke on your
balcony i look above me a little bit
confused and see someone sticking his
head out of a window
it is so british good evening
in canada we would it would be hey bud
can you not
and in america i think you would already
at this point have weapons drawn
evening and why should i not do it
the neighbor then started a rant about
how the smoke goes
up and into his apartment woke him up
how he's been patient for a while but
now can't take it anymore how he has a
right to a healthy life and doesn't want
my filthy habits to impact it and so on
so a rant about how hot gases rise
he then suggests i should smoke in a
kitchen or go completely outside because
he doesn't like the smell
so you're saying i can't smoke in my
apartment on the balcony because you
don't like it
you mentioned you have a right to a
healthy life don't i have a right to do
with mine whatever i want i didn't come
to your home and start smoking after all
can't you just close your window and
move on to what she replied but it's hot
outside
i don't want to close my window now at
this point i'm not confused anymore
oh [ __ ]
just startled from his sheer audacity
so let me get this straight you don't
like me smoking here at my place but you
don't want to inconvenience yourself by
closing the window instead you want
me to do something differently even
though it's you who has
a problem with how things are that about
right let me get this straight
i'm playing music at 200 decibels
you're choosing not to sleep with ear
plugs in and it's somehow my
behavior that's causing the problem here
i don't think so
that seems a little do i not have the
right to do with my life whatever i
choose
instead you want me to do something
differently even though it's you who has
a problem with how things are
that about right yes well okay then
i replied and lighted another roll
up la da
it's the [ __ ] double g snoop
dogg
[Laughter]
i ignored his threats to pour cold water
on me whenever i'm smoking
since by the time i finished he was
still going on about pouring water
i simply said yeah you'd do that and
headed inside
so the question is am i the [ __ ]
or is he just an entitled jerk after all
look
tldr
i appreciate that there's a tldr this is
a good one man because it is
this is a spicy one
my thought
is heavily influenced by the fact here
that i'm not a smoker i'm sure
smokers are not going to enjoy this
personally someone who's lived in
apartment buildings shared living
situations
i would prefer
if a smoker would go outside
if they would go you know aware from the
air away from the air
intake valve or uh air intake greats
yo healthy gamer thanks for the raid
we're looking at people's uh
mental health on reddit and judging it
from a position of ignorance
and we're talking about cigarette
smoking right now so it's it's right on
brand
i'm sure anyway so for people that are
just joining the
it's an am i the [ __ ] thread and the
thread
is uh who's the [ __ ] someone who
smokes on their balcony
or the neighbor above them who gets
annoyed by the smoke coming into their
apartment
personally
don't i'm being forced to take a stand
for the first time ever
usually i'm just like i'm just on the
right side of history
um i'm on the side of the of the
upstairs neighbor
quite frankly i think generally speaking
you know
smoking uh in a situation where the
smoke goes through somebody's open
window
is uh not nice
stinks up the place secondhand smoke is
dangerous
uh i'm not even approaching it from the
situation of like the same
you know like oh so i don't have a right
to smoke but you have a right to keep
your window open
it's not really like that it's like you
know you're on the second floor can't
you just go outside
and and you know like smoke it in the
courtyard or something like that
that's that's my that's my two cents on
it
or like live on the fourth floor close
the window for two minutes
hey hey bang bang bang is two in the
morning bang bang bang can you close
your window
real quick i just need to smoke a
cigarette on my balcony
then you can open it up after that like
that's just
i don't understand how you couldn't like
especially if you just got home from
work why not just
smoke it outside and then go inside and
go to bed
plus this guy was talking about he seems
a little deluded to me
to begin with which is that he's like
you know i should uh
i can just smoke it in my room to begin
with because my cigarettes don't smoke
regardless
so i i kind of feel like he's not the
best judge of whether or not
his habit is inconveniencing other
people like i
i look at it kind of similarly to like
loud music you know what i mean i did i
forgot about the fact that it's
scentless uh mcbaron's tobacco
it's uh it's mcbaron's choice if
anyone's interested
one of the most smelly smokeless
tobaccos out there
but i look at it kind of like like loud
music you know it's 2 a.m
you're causing a disturbance with
something that you want to do
are there things that your neighbors
could do to maybe mitigate the nuisance
that it applies to them
yeah but at the same time is is it your
neighbor's responsibility to make sure
that you're not being a nuisance i don't
think so
but i think that there's going to be a
lot of people with disagreeing opinions
here
but i will also say in at least in
vancouver
this is already like codified into the
bylaws
like we don't uh most buildings at least
as far as i know are supposed to be
smoke free to begin with so when people
smoke on their balcony they legitimately
get like a 200
fine from the from the building uh
like strata corporation not from the
police
so you if you want to smoke like they
want you to smoke outside here
so this is already i'm of course i'm
like a little biased because this is
already what it's like here
it's rare to begin with for sure
plus the other thing is and and i'm not
suggesting this is what this person is
doing
um but you know when you're like under
people the smoke
you don't get the smoke smell and the
rising of it and stuff like that
um but you know you get like ash blowing
off their balcony and stuff like that
cigarette butts that fall from their
balcony up to
or down to your balcony like
you know that that's not because they're
smoking it's because they're like you
know
flicking their butts off the balcony and
stuff like that but still
anyway that's that's my thoughts
you get a little bit of the smoke i
suppose again that's why i like it it's
controversial
by the way oh i didn't look at the votes
you're the [ __ ] 46 not the [ __ ] 41
everybody sucks here 5
no [ __ ] here 2 i will also kind of
say
it it depends on how you look at this
okay
i kind of feel like everybody sucks here
i don't think so
i don't really feel like the neighbor
well i mean i guess the neighbor does
suck for suggesting he's
to pour cold water on you
that's kind of a that's kind of a dick
move but i don't feel like the neighbor
sucks for saying good evening could you
not smoke on your balcony it seems like
a
reasonable request you could say yes or
no to but then
no [ __ ] i'm like i don't know i kind
of feel like o.p
is an [ __ ] can i tell you why and
it's not fair
the fact that he keeps referring to his
cigarettes as roll-ups
me everything i need to know
it's the i i don't know it's like the
the super super libertarian argument of
like am i not allowed to do anything
that i ever want
and i'm like no of course not i mean i
guess like you could literally do
whatever you want but like
you know if you drink 12 beers and then
drive your car you might go to prison or
like die you know you of course you can
do
just about anything but you're not free
from the consequences of those actions
afterwards
what's next a license to make toast to
my own damn toaster
it's just it's just that's it's not the
argument that i would use
the if i were the smoker the argument i
would use
is
hold on i'm trying to think about it is
the balcony not
an outdoor space i think i would try to
get into more of a discussion about the
the zoning does a balcony count as
you know private property inside or does
it count as an outdoor space
i don't know especially if you got
concrete above you i i would get into
the semantics so if i'm not a lawyer
on reddit or in real life for that
matter but i feel like at the same time
you know you could uh you could make a
discussion there
versus uh is man not entitled to the
sweat of his brow
but i do also feel like your your
problem here could be
solved by walking down one flight of
stairs and then walking like
20 feet away from your building so it's
just my two cents i suppose
maybe that's a forehead moment but
ftl man okay
am i the [ __ ] for honking at a
pedestrian playing pokemon
go in a crosswalk
it's got to be a no i feel like you well
okay but i'm just going to hit you with
the cliff notes
there's a person crossing the road in
the middle of the street trying to catch
a pokemon
i blew my horn the guy turned and yelled
he's got five more seconds till the
light changes i yelled at him to stop
playing in the street
my mom told me i'm the [ __ ] because
he his light hadn't changed yet
um stopping in the middle of a crosswalk
to catch a pokemon kinda
i'm gonna kinda i'm gonna give you a
turbo answer that you're not the [ __ ]
there
i mean you're the driver is not the
[ __ ] but we already know how i feel
about jaywalkers obviously
was the person a kid i don't think so
they i mean
it's pokemon go that's only played by 35
year olds
i'm going top this month i need to find
some
some better answers am i the [ __ ] for
not insist rephrase oh my god it's so
long this is the longest post i've ever
seen
am i the [ __ ] for insisting that my
brother and his girlfriend not wear
gross clothes
in my car i 28 female
have a very sensitive nose
i can't do perfume i tell guys not to
wear cologne on a date i can't be around
cigarette or pot smoke or i start
gagging
another reason perhaps that the guy from
the last post was maybe a little bit of
a a yta
my whole family knows this and for the
most part are very supportive this
weekend my brother called me up at 2am
always at 2am right because he and his
girlfriend had missed the last train out
of the city because they met up with
some people at a bar and wound up going
back to their place for a bit he asked
me to come get him
my apartment is 40 minutes outside the
city and our parents who he lives with
are about an hour away
already he's the [ __ ]
it were you asleep at this point because
i i feel like if you don't plan for a
way to get home and you have to rely on
somebody
like calling your sister at 2 a.m that's
a big ask
i think you got to get an uber i told
them to get an uber
because if they reeked of alcohol
cigarettes and weed i didn't want them
into my car he said it would be too
expensive promised they didn't smell
and begged me to come am i
i mean like this feels so much like the
last one
they're like i've been doing stinky
things all night do you stink no
obviously not come on you can't smell
anything you're
you were at the bar at last call it's a
wasteland in there
i told him as long as they don't smell
i'd come get him but that i was prepared
to leave him if he did okay i can see
where this is going
i get to the address about an hour later
they came out it was clear they were
both drunk
my brother went to hug me and i could
immediately smell weed on him i started
wretching told him it wasn't going to
work and to call an uber
we showered there's no way you're
smelling anything
it's all in your head he said to me
apparently their solution was to shower
in these people's apartments thinking it
would get rid of the tobacco and a weed
smell on their clothes
i told them to call an uber and got back
in my car he banged on the window i told
him he wasn't getting in my car like
that i told him i'd give him half the
money for an
uber and i was leaving oh no
he told me to just roll the windows down
i told him i don't want it in my car
he said i showered these are the only
clothes i have i can't ride home naked
that gave me an idea i opened my trunk
grabbed two hold on
grabbed two blankets and two trash bags
i told them to put their clothes in the
bags and cover up with the blankets
his girlfriend handed it back and said
[ __ ] that i'll walk and
walked away this is
these are real human beings that live on
planet earth
do you ever just read these posts and go
like
my life is so simple like i'm deriving
so much contentment right now just from
realizing i have never
put myself into this situation
it's just it's it's so complicated just
to get home
couldn't you just sleep at your friend's
place and then at like you know eight in
the morning take public transit back
instead of getting naked and driving
home in a garbage bag
my brother told me i was out of my mind
it was all in my head i reached into my
wallet pulled out fifty dollars and said
to call uber he handed it back told me
to hold up and ran after his girlfriend
they came back and asked if they could
sit in the back with the windows open i
told him i wouldn't be able to stand it
for an hour so they begrudgingly
stripped
put their clothes in the bags and i tied
them off and threw them in the trunk
i drove them to our parents house in
silence and dropped them off without a
thank you
my brother's girlfriend unfriended me on
facebook he and she are not speaking and
my mom is furious saying i embarrassed
them
and i was being overly sensitive she
says i should have called her so she
could have gotten them my mom goes to
bed at nine so i don't think she would
have been thrilled i feel bad that i put
the condition on it
but i would not have been able to
tolerate being in my car otherwise
okay we need to look at the edits first
my reaction to smell is very extreme i
wretch i gag i throw up my eyes water my
stomach turns i get migraines my heart
races
i believe you if if this whole post is
real i believe this part too
i think you know what it is i think it's
like it's debate class
you have to acknowledge like shared
truths as the foundation for the
argument okay
i'm taking op at face value that
if they smell cologne they gag
now if i was in public
and someone started gagging because they
smelled my speed stick or something like
that
would i go like okay
you may be i'm sorry i'm the [ __ ] for
wearing some deodorant
um yeah but in this situation i don't
disagree with it for sure
i mean i don't disbelieve it i guess i
should say
everyone who's voting that i'm the
[ __ ] seems to think i forced this
girl to take off her clothes
there is no part of me that enjoyed
asking my brother to give up his clothes
to get in my car
i had no smile on my face and i
apologize to them for being so sensitive
to smell
i pushed for the uber i even offered to
cover most of it
they didn't want to get it an uber when
they were in that condition i was
embarrassed to ask them to strip but
there was not a way for me to make it an
hour with them in the car in those
clothes
i did not tell them to get naked i told
them to put their clothes in a bag
there's a difference i didn't say get
naked
i said put your clothes in the trash bag
if you could put your stinky clothes in
the trash bag without taking them off
by all means otherwise i don't see like
i'm the [ __ ] here
they went behind the car i had my back
to them and was keeping my distance my
brother handed me the bags and i tied
them up and threw them in the trunk
without inspecting them
at first i thought she inspected them
and i was like she's the [ __ ] now
that i know she
didn't inspect them i'm inclined to
think that maybe she was in the right
the blankets were a good size so all you
could really see is they were both
barefoot and had removed their shirts
and pants i do not know if they left
their underwear on or were naked under
there
any intimate bits were covered is we
don't need to go into all that kind of
stuff
um knowing all the context
i would be inclined to agree with the
flare i think
and say that everybody sucks here but
can i can i
offer something here
the sister who is the op her
absurd behavior
in this whole situation is predicated
upon being called at 2 am
roused from sleep potentially at least
called outside of the normal hours that
we would consider
the quorum acceptable to call someone at
asked for them to drive 40 minutes out
of their way and then an hour to their
parents house because
the brother and his girlfriend didn't
adhere to a plan
to handle their own transportation
that immediately puts them on the moral
high ground
from my situation
is op a little
uh out of line
[Laughter]
yeah um my two cents
is that she should have just said um
here's not she shouldn't have even given
them the money to be honest
in my opinion um but she should have
just said
i'm not gonna do it take an uber if if
she's so
sensitive to any kind of smell like this
that she would throw up if she was
interacting with them for more than an
hour
so i i think she this doesn't make her
the [ __ ]
but i don't think she should have even
enabled them by going
out to their apartment in the first
place i think she should have just been
like
i'm not coming either call mom or take
an uber
and i'll tell you as well your brother
is going to learn
a very serious lesson if he calls you
you're his sister and you say no
wake up our mom at 2 a.m to come pick
you up while you're stinky
that's probably the last time that the
brother is going to do that
i think that next time he'll make sure
he he takes the bus home because that's
going to be an embarrassing
and shameful drive
that being said i
this this post should be called am i the
weirdo i mean that's kind of where i'm
at
is like when she's like
i made them well not made them i told
them if they want to drive home with me
you can take off your clothes
put them in a garbage bag and wrap
yourself up in some blankets
i'm like well you're within your right
to do it if that's what's required
uh to get home without having you throw
up
but at the same time you should never
ask anybody to ever do that
the suggestion that uh
you had to to have them strip off their
clothes and then drive home naked with
blankets on
is it does it's not criminal i think but
it's very bizarre
no wonder by the way like the brother
is probably like this is nothing i
haven't seen before i grew up with this
but the brother's girlfriend i mean i
would be furious
i think i also might be like
chad can we just take an uber you know
like like this is crazy
um but can i also tell you that i think
i would have a great sense of humor
about it
in in my 20s at least i think i would
have a sense of humor about it
hello okay
enjoy your walk
like i think if my friend's sister came
and picked us up and she was like you
have to be
you have to take off your clothes and
strip down into this blanket i would be
like whoa
comfy ride comfy ride home
plus ubers did not exist when i was in
this phase of my life
and the taxi probably would have been
like 300 bucks so
op made an update okay how how does one
find an update i'm 100 years old
is there an easy way to do that
click okay i'll just click on their
username i just don't want to see their
other posts because i'm sure they're all
on
our slash rick and morty um
okay give me a second update this is
from 21 days ago
oh my god it's so freaking
long dude okay okay okay
update day of course it is
i bet before i read it i feel like all
the updates are like
i got out of my head and we started
talking about it and we're friends again
like every update post it's never like
and then she went to prison
it's always like we had a conversation
and
you know worked it out so my brother's
girlfriend texted me that she wanted to
meet up
and drop the blanket off when i dropped
them off i grabbed the bags out of my
truck and handed them to them i did not
ask for the blankets back
as i did not she's so paranoid about
like i didn't see my brother's
you know what i did not see my brothers
you know what
a lot of people are suggesting i did
this just to catch a glance at my
brothers you know what
i did not she came over to my apartment
i joked if she had the undress to come
inside
and handed me back my blanket she said
it was very soft and comfortable and
apologize for not giving it back that
night
she actually washed it in unscented
detergent
wow hey she thanked me for coming to get
them the other night apologize for
freaking out and explained a few things
my brother had told her the trains ran
all night he wanted to stay with these
friends of his and couldn't she couldn't
stand the smell in there
it's it's a common theme
it is stinky everywhere she had called
several friends none of whom were
willing to come and get her at 2am he
claimed our mother didn't keep her phone
on which is why he called me
he kept insisting i'd never let them in
her car and they should just stay there
i think he called me just so i would
refuse and they could stay there she's
the one that suggested
they shower so it wouldn't be as bad for
me okay
since my brother lives with our parents
she thinks he wanted some alone time
with her since they never get to spend
overnights together
she didn't even realize that i suggested
they strip when i handed her the blanket
in the bag
i didn't hear my brother say let's just
stay here she thought i was giving her a
blanket to sleep and that's when she
stormed off
when she was walking away she took all
of us off facebook
because she was done with my brother she
added me back
when he caught up hold on when he caught
up he suggested again they just stayed
there he told her that i told her
he told her that i told her the only way
they could ride was if they stripped off
their clothes and went home in blankets
she told them i feel gross i want my bed
i don't even care at this point let's
just go
when they came back he suggested the
windows rolled down why is it it's
it's so like it's like reading an
encyclopedia
when i refused she started undressing so
he went along with it
as for why they didn't call an uber he
didn't want to
and she didn't want to ride in one alone
drunk for an hour miraculously she's not
done with my brother she's pissed at him
for lying to her and stranding her
without a ride back but she's going over
there to talk she loves that butt head
as she put it
she's made me a lot more focused she's
made him a lot more focused and she's
been good for him so i'm happy they're
sticking with
each other for now i feel a lot better
after talking i really did think that
they might be dating at the end of this
when when they said that she had um
she washed in scentless detergent i was
like this is
i don't believe this anymore we'll do a
few more before we pivot here
i believe this again i think it's one of
those things that's like
if you wanted to lie on reddit i don't
think you would lie to be like guess
what check this out
i can't smell anything or i throw up
that's
that's how busted my olfactory system is
just though is a weird anti-flex
anyway it seems like it all got to got
sorted out in the end
am i the [ __ ] for wearing compression
shorts to the gym
[Laughter]
i gotta know i don't even understand
am i the [ __ ] for wearing compression
shorts to the gym
i recently moved to a new city and
joined a local gym i always worked out
of my apartment gym but before this
but before but this new apartment does
not have one so i joined a local chain
gym
when i work out i usually wear
compression shorts and a t-shirt mostly
because i find the most comfortable for
the types of exercises that i do
so the way i understand it compression
shorts are
uh like very
tight like lycra
almost they you you wear the yeah it's
like under armour
spandex like you wear them
uh for the same reason that you wear
like a compression sock or something
like that i i think it's for uh
like increased blood flow or something
but usually you wear them as like an
under
layer not as
not as your outerwear but anyway
just to give you some context if you're
not sure what a compression short is
um however a couple weeks after joining
i had a woman come up to me and tell me
i needed to put pants on
this wasn't a gym staff just another
member i asked her if there was any rule
or dress code that specified that she
said she didn't know but i was exposing
myself which is inappropriate
and then i can already hear it like so i
took that personally
for the record my compression shorts are
not translucent or any
oh really your compression shorts are
not translucent
that's good that you're you're not
buying uh
translucent clothing to wear to the gym
they're a gray heather or black fabric
hold on okay
so just so many every word changes the
dynamic here
um i pictured them as being
black and i was like
you know they're i'm sure they're short
i'm sure they're
tight but at least they're dark when
now he's saying they're gray heather and
i'm like
that's maybe i'm a prude
that's a little bit more obscene that is
an
gray heather is an underwear color
especially in
in compression shorts parlets
[Laughter]
at least with like black compression
shorts i could be like maybe they're
just
short but anyway what she is referring
to though is the bulge
which obviously is visible when wearing
compression shorts
i told her i don't believe there's any
issue with my shorts and put my
headphones back in
a couple of weeks later i had a
different woman come up to what what are
the odds
two people with the exact wrong opinion
wow crazy man
uh i had a different woman come up and
do something similar she said are you
gonna put pants on dude to which i told
her i was wearing shorts
the gym itself hasn't talked to me about
this as far as i'm aware it's not that
unusual to wear compression shorts
nor do i see how they're different from
leggings which are very common
i can understand how the visible bulge
may make some people uncomfortable but
how hard is it to just not look at it
wow you're definitely the [ __ ]
and i'm gonna say something else okay my
hunch
is that your dick is not as big as you
think it is
i think you're wearing tight compression
shorts i think this guy's getting a
little thrill
i think when pete when women come up to
him he's like
in his head he's like oh another woman
threatened by my unbelievably huge bulge
i think that he is trying to i think
he's getting the rise out of this based
on the way that he wrote this
i think he's a little freak hold on we
gotta we gotta load up the comments for
this
give me a second here i'm i'm looking at
the shorts
one moment please
i have to be honest these are longer
than i thought they were i know this
green region's a little screwed up
they're longer than i thought they were
but they
are much tighter than i thought they
were
like they it seems like they go to maybe
just the top of the knee
but uh they they seem very tight
what is this
why is he why is he vibrating what
happened to his hand
what's going on man he's moving so fast
he couldn't catch it um
can i be honest this this changes my
opinion somewhat i still think op's kind
of a weirdo
but that doesn't seem that bad i in my
head i was picturing
shorter like i was picturing like
not briefs but like boxer briefs oh
click play it's a video i see
and i'm sure the gray is is worse
the way that he's reacted to the
comments like here's
here's my thinking okay it's one of
those things where you're like if one
person comes up to you
and it's like your outfit's
inappropriate for the gym i think you
could be like
you know take one of these and call me
in the morning and give him a middle
finger emoji
if two people come up to you in like a
week and they're like hey your outfit's
making us uncomfortable
i think you should i think you should
you know maybe consider wearing pants to
the gym instead
that's my thoughts on that or you know
i mean it depends i mean the other thing
is you could just
keep working out of the gym and deal
with the fact that you know once every
two weeks someone's gonna come
up to you and be like hey you're wearing
your underwear in the gym but
all it takes is a loose pair of athletic
shorts on top that's what i'm saying
what if we did that with women i mean
you can't just use that as an argument
it's like
yeah i mean there are double standards
is you know
a situation where you gotta look at uh
society right like this though the whole
segment that we're doing here is like a
deconstruction of proper behavior in
public
you know you're if you get to the point
where you're like well what if
a woman was wearing compression shorts
well like you you examine that through
the lens
i can't do it without having contacts i
feel like if
if a woman uh got asked by two guys
to like hey could you maybe not wear
compression
shorts to the gym and instead wear
something a little bit less revealing
it does carry the context of like maybe
these guys are creeps
but i think it also carries the context
of like if she made the post that was
like why can't these guys stop looking
at my like
you know my incredible assets then i
would be like she's a weirdo too
[Laughter]
if she had made the if she had the same
kind of energy that this guy had
where she was like i can't help it if my
awesome
package is getting this much attention
you know i would be like okay she's also
trying to
she's getting the same kind of thrills
that the guy's getting
this reminds me actually kate and i were
going for a walk yesterday we saw
uh probably like a 70 year old man
and uh he had like an old timey pair of
binoculars
we were like what is this guy doing like
bird watching or something like that
he was not bird watching
he was looking at uh joggers
and sunbathers and uh
etc etc and just
not touching himself but just
just looking which is also weird um
obviously
but you know it and you gotta be careful
with what you're saying
um in a way it was almost like
weirder because if he was
engaging in an act of self-love i think
i would be like
he's just you know out of his mind
but him just kind of like
passively taking it all in i was like is
he like
is he storing this data for later or
like what's going on
he's just very anyway sorry he's the
[ __ ] in this situation
that being said i will say having you
know gone to the gym many times
look i it it really so much of these
posts is really just like
are you willing to change
literally anything about your behavior
in order to
smooth over a situation even if you
think you're in the right
you know what i mean like when i'm at a
home i'll work out in my underwear
i don't care you know if i go to the gym
is it comfortable
or is it uh unacceptable to work out in
like boxer briefs
probably is it also you know could could
you put on shorts that are shorter than
boxer briefs and they would consider it
to be
probably fine you would be like yeah i
suppose but
you know you gotta i don't know i feel
like
if you're gonna wear really tight
compression shorts to the gym
you might have to deal with people on
occasion being like hey you know
i can see your i can see your bulge
i guess and you could either put shorts
on over top of that or
alternatively you could be like thank
you so much that's where i'm at i don't
know if he's an [ __ ] i do think the
way that he wrote it was a little
strange
am i the [ __ ] for giving my friend
the wrong answers in an examination
resulting in her failing
throw away because my main has lots of
personal info and even though i don't
care if my friend sees this i don't want
some person
who thinks i'm the [ __ ] which i may
be to okay yes
understood my friend lucy and i have
known each other since middle school
from a young age
lucy has developed a habit of asking me
for answers to test papers or
assignments and i always gave them to
her but also made her understand the
questions and answers
yikes keep in mind 17 and 18 these are
these are kids
you know it's off to a bad start but
they are just kids
junior year i told lucy i would no
longer help her cheat since our grades
had an actual impact
and consequence and she always managed
to convince me to help her especially
since we've been friends for so long
this is one of the reason why i may be
the [ __ ] by the way since i helped
her develop this habit of depending on
me
okay well like
i i don't know what to say about that
one i feel like it's one of those things
where
obviously you're not the [ __ ] for
helping someone develop a habit
of them being an [ __ ] however i
am like simultaneously i think that
she knows that this doesn't make her an
[ __ ] and is putting it out there as a
little
pity breadcrumb like hansel and gretel
style
i think she's like i might be an [ __ ]
for making them treat me like
crap you know anyway that's just my
cynicism coming up
um she would always leave a few
questions and this basically ensured the
teacher wouldn't find out she was
cheating because at the end of the
examination remarks would be different
so the teacher wouldn't have any reason
to doubt us
i get a's and she writes enough to get
b's this is our last year in school and
at the start of the semester i told her
that this time i would definitely not
help her for real this time source dude
just trust me
i told her that enough was enough and
then if she got into a good college with
the mark she got by cheating
that would not be fair to someone who
worked hard she said she understood and
that was that in the first two major
examinations she got
seized and i guess her parents were not
happy lucy then begged me to help her
again and would constantly badger me
every day by spamming my
socials or when we meet up with friends
i told her i no longer wanted to talk to
her but she would just not let things go
and even threatened to reveal some
secrets i had trusted her with when we
were younger
oh my god
that's pretty bad she's actually like uh
she's like jim carrey from the cable guy
so two weeks ago when we had an
examination she asked me for answers i
gave her the wrong ones
she left some and somehow got marks for
that but her overall grade was
f we got the results yesterday until
that moment i was just
i thought i was justified in doing what
i did to get her to stop harassing me
but when she got the results she started
sobbing
like full-on crying and i felt so guilty
she later called me a lot of names and
told me i crushed her dreams and i feet
so bad
but i know i did what i did so that she
would stop with the cheating so
i'm confused am i the [ __ ]
very very classic situation
where your friend
is definitely the [ __ ] no question
about that
there's not even anything to discuss
because she's just i mean literally just
cheating
on all of her tests and then on top of
that
uh also threatening to blackmail you if
you don't help her
are you the [ __ ]
i would not because she cried and not
because she got an f
you you're an [ __ ] and if we if we
define the situation as having one
[ __ ]
you're not the [ __ ] your friend is
the [ __ ]
you could have refused you could have
been like go ahead
tell everybody i wet my pants until i
was in the eighth grade
but can i tell you i'm kind of like you
know what
i think she's not the [ __ ] i know
that
so this has been voted as as everyone
sucks here um
i'm inclined to say at the very least
she's not an [ __ ]
for uh giving her the wrong answers
i think that's a little based i'd be i'd
say yb you're based however
i do think you're kind of the [ __ ]
for
helping her cheat on
tests for like literally what seems like
you know five or six years
so he's a little bit of not the [ __ ]
a little bit you're the [ __ ] and a
little bit of your base
that's my uh that's my assumption on
this one
definitely though even if you're in a
wrong you're not in the
wrong this is uh your your friend is uh
your friend is definitely the most in
the wrong
but i mean this is like the smoking one
i know i know they did uh
people don't believe me i'm not trying
to flex
i never cheated on a test
middle school high school college
you just fill it out and if you lose
then
if you get a bad mark then you get a bad
mark
if anything i always feel like it's kind
of hard like how do you i don't even
know how you cheat on a test in like
high school
like is it like
maybe like i i have to be honest i don't
think my eyes
are good enough for me to look
over at my friend's desk see their paper
and see what answers they put down i
don't think i could do it
i don't think i have the glance
technology built in on an ocular level
and if you go i think you would get
caught right like i don't know
different periods of the same class
i get that makes sense but if you're in
different periods of the same class
isn't that just studying
[Laughter]
isn't it just if your friend had the
test
at nine in the morning and you've got it
at noon and then you're like hey teach
me the stuff
like isn't that just i mean you're
studying the answers admittedly but at
least you're learning
at least you're not just copying
verbatim
not quite i don't know man i'm like
you're what's the point
what's the point of school if not to if
not to learn some answers
is it supposed to be a test about
you know studying exactly the right
material or is it supposed to be do you
know this thing
based on one person said bass so i'm
moving on
oh and we're moving on in general okay
that's the end of the uh
the am i the [ __ ] chord this week but
i had a great time
definitely think am i the [ __ ]
filtered is a is a good



ah that's better being able to see
the actual layout having enough white
space
i actually feel like i we were on old
reddit for a second there now i feel
like i'm uh
i'm in a much better position like i
just feel safer
i feel like i have space around me like
that white space on the side i i quite
enjoy
let's look at the top posts um from the
last
we were talking about it a second ago
like the reddit is not exactly the
fastest uh working website on the planet
here
uh we'll look at the top post from this
week on uh
am i the [ __ ] filtered top
top post hi reddit i'm wes and i lead
our sustainability efforts at accenture
okay wes um you're not an [ __ ] but at
the same time i do kind of wish you
weren't at the like very top of the
um board here but that's okay how about
this one
i like this would i be the [ __ ] am i
the [ __ ] for
siding with my mom over my wife and
humiliating my wife
in front of my family um
we're about to find out i can see the
flare but i choose not to okay
we had a family dinner tonight and it
did not end well this is always a great
start hey fishy head
thanks for the gifted subscriptions my
wife doesn't get along with my family
i do not allow any blatant disrespect
but i know they don't like her i had to
cut off my younger sister because of how
disrespectful she was
but we are still in contact with my
mom's stepdad and middle sister
you know this doesn't seem that crazy so
far i mean it's family's family it
happens
my wife thinks that my mom is a picky
eater i don't think that's fair growing
up i was exposed to a huge variety we
ate stuff from different cultures we ate
vegetables
my mom loves spicy food
i i like it's usually in the second
paragraph
you just end up getting uh like
something that makes the other person
like it it finally reveals the
personality
flaw that is going to lead to the rest
of the post and i love it
she just doesn't like the type of food
my wife grew up with which usually
involves barbecue sauce or
thick gravy
to be clear my mom will eat the foods
without the sauces but my wife won't
accommodate her and says it isn't her
job to cuddle my mom
i kind of get where she's coming from
because my mom is used to getting what
she wants and can be
ridiculously stubborn
always a barbecue sauce or a thick gravy
last time they came over like four
months ago my mom refused to eat she
said my wife could have separated the
piece of chicken before putting the
barbecue sauce on and she was just being
a [ __ ]
okay that's a little much i would say
personally uh
but maybe there's some foundational
aggression that's happened here in the
past
it's a easy everybody sucks here can i
also say without being too judgmental
to begin with it's just barbecue sauce
you know i don't mean this suggests like
you can't have food preferences
i think it would be a little bit of a
different story right now if she was
putting
i mean it's just it's it's delicious
tang and sweetness
you know the idea that you would
separate the breasts if she asked for it
i guess is fine but i'm just surprised
that's all i'm saying
um i did yell at my mom for the language
but i'm sick of this
for tonight i asked my wife to make
anything not
involving barbecue or gravy and she
refused so i went out and got my mom's
salmon and vegetables from a local
restaurant
when my wife saw it she called me a
piece of [ __ ]
she told my mom if she wanted to eat it
she had to go outside
and then when she got mad because my mom
went in the pool
she ate on a float we don't have chairs
out there are you telling me
so let's just
tell me your family is dysfunctional
without telling me your family's
dysfunctional
uh asked my wife to cook something that
doesn't involve barbecue sauce or gravy
she said impossible literally can't be
done that you've just eliminated 99
of the foods uh that exist on the planet
okay
uh your mother-in-law comes over and she
says couldn't you have just given me a
plain chicken breast
[ __ ] a little bit over the top on top
of that to begin with
then he said hey the guy said hey mom
op says hey mom don't call my wife a
[ __ ] that's a little rude
but i will go out and get you salmon and
vegetables from a local restaurant
wife calls you a piece of [ __ ] and then
says
if you want which is so abnormal if you
want to eat the food you have to eat it
outside
which is i just can't imagine having a
demand like that to begin with i guess
she's just offended
um and then your mom
gets on a floaty and eats the salmon and
vegetables in the pool
that's unbelievable it's it's so many
bizarre behavioral choices in such a
small space of time
i just imagine that like the mom eating
the salmon in the
in an above ground pool on like a
floating chair and the wife seething
like looking through the blinds like
my dad ended up cussing at us both so i
had to ask
him to leave it never it never gets
better
my when we went out to get my mom my
wife tried to splash her and make the
float tip
my mom got away and my wife ended up in
tears
needless to say we will not do dinner at
our house again but i feel like such an
ass i think i was technically in the
clear but my wife cried and that hurts
me deep
ed why are so many people asking why i
don't cook i'm not opposed to it but i'm
not allowed to cook
that is something my wife asks of her
partners and it makes her feel secure
what the hell are you talking about
[Laughter]
this this feels a little bit like
everybody's fake here
um
so you the husband cannot cook
because the wife forbids it let's assume
it's real okay but
um that's insane also
i i do doubt
can i just say that i doubt that the
number one question he got is why don't
you cook
i am guessing the number one question
that he got is why doesn't your wife
just cook something without barbecue
sauce or
and or gravy because that really
eliminates
like less than i think 30 foods
that are commonly cooked in a home
kitchen and and really could have uh
made anything else including salmon and
vegetables
uh so who's the [ __ ] if we're
assuming this story is real
it's um okay
everybody sucks here is my that's my
verdict right now
but can i tell you i kind of don't think
the husband
uh sucks mom sucks
she called son's wife a [ __ ] there's
basically no situation that makes that
uh acceptable there's probably a couple
like if she hit you with her car or
something like that while she was
looking at her phone
um but simultaneously like that's over
the line
especially just because she made a food
that you don't like okay even if you
asked for her not to do it you'd just be
like
oh you just swallow your pride on that
one and then never go back i think
um the wife is uh a total [ __ ]
and uh insane as well
i don't even know what to say
so so much of this is bizarre to me um
in particular not allowing
your mother-in-law to eat food that she
brought in your house
and then also trying to tip over her
floaty in the pool
i will say that although i said the mom
sucks the fact that
she chose not to just eat outside like
on the grass and instead she ate in the
pool
is actually kind of sick that that
almost redeems her
however the husband being
not an [ __ ] here almost it to me i
feel like if i was in the court of
public opinion
i would want more information cause i
don't believe
that your mom is an [ __ ] and your
wife is an [ __ ]
and you're just like an impartial third
party
i believe that if we ask them for their
opinion on the story we might get a
little bit more context to the husband's
behavior
because i i i doubt that it's like an
[ __ ] stew with like a little not
[ __ ] you know piece of cornbread on
top i bet that there's something else
going on here
um but i would say for me
on this one this this has got to be in
everybody sucks here
with a little kicker wife is worse i
mean come on
you tried to tip over your mother-in-law
i don't even
there there's been uh times where like
my mother-in-law
you know she like drove kate and me to
uh like an event and when when she
drives she like slams on the gas
when the light turns green and then when
the car in front of her hits their brake
lights she slams on the brake
right and i get motion sick like crazy
and i'm just like
in the back of the car going like like
almost throwing up
you know what i say when we arrive i say
thanks for the ride
that's it you just uh you know you gotta
you gotta be polite
okay yeah yeah you're b everybody's
based here okay
would i be the [ __ ] if i took away my
son's gaming pc
you know i said most situations it
sounds like they're gonna be
the [ __ ] and then they're not
this one i'm like i guarantee i'm gonna
be like you're not the [ __ ]
i would expect there's almost no
situation where i'm gonna read this and
then be like
you're not in the clear let me get he's
posting on
he he's calling people slurs when he
plays apex legends he's going into
streamers chats and going like sorry egg
gotta leave
germa went live etc etc let's see i'm
just looking at this to get mad now
i just want to get mad
oh wow this is a short one my teenage
son has a gaming pc teenage son with a
gaming pc getting high on
information he plays four to five hours
per day this has caused his summer
school grades to suffer
and normal school grades to suffer he is
also not completing chores or being
self-disciplined
this weekend i finally snapped and took
away his pc but this entire week he's
been angry and annoyed at me saying i am
mean and unfair he's also saying i can't
take it away because he saved it with
his own money and he got
that he got from birthdays christmas and
selling on etsy
hold on
sigma grind is the rising grind rising
grand gamer
he's got an etsy store can we
i gotta go into the thread i got to see
more about this kids
etsy store i only want his grades to
improve and will give the pc back if his
grades go up am i the [ __ ]
this is a an actual tough one man
i thought it was going to be easy okay
yo matt x powers you're not the [ __ ]
for those gifted subs thank you
thank you what can i say one thing right
out of the gate
i think my parents must be glad
that they uh raised the child
when gaming pcs were not all the rage
like i my dad he took my xbox away once
or twice
when i was like 14 or 15 years old but
that's literally you just like
unplugged two things and just you know
forced it over your shoulder
a gaming pc that's a that's a pain in
the ass you got to unplug like 30 things
at the back of it
so let's talk about this a little bit
more
um the first thing i would say is it
sounds like the dad
has his son's best interest in mind okay
he wants his son to be good at school
i feel like there's a little subtext
that goes on here which is that if your
teenage son is in summer school
or mom sure yeah or mom uh
if your teenage son is in summer school
i believe that the only reason you end
up in summer school
unless you're getting ahead of classes
to make like your senior year that much
easier
is to you know for remedial purposes
get your marks up from the previous year
or semester or
or you know get some supplemental
information so
it seems like the grade thing is a
sticking point it's a real issue
and when you're a teenager like when
you're an adult if you want to screw up
your own life
nobody can stop you really you know uh
well except for you know the police i
guess but
you know when you're a teenager the
parent has a prerogative to be like
you know like in 10 years you're gonna
be like i i really threw away my
high school education and my maybe like
my ability to succeed in college because
i was too into gentian impact like
you're gonna end up
there there will be regrets there let me
just say however
i will say it's a prickly er subject
when he did buy the pc himself
i mean when he when he says he bought it
himself with the money that he got from
birthdays and christmas
i'm like i you know i'm playing kind of
a tiny violin for that one
it's like i worked hard being alive and
also
thanking santa claus for that money but
the etsy stuff
sure it seems like he he put in a little
bit of effort there to
to hustle for the etsy stuff but at the
same time
you know i think it's i i originally
thought i was gonna be like
maybe not you're the [ __ ] but you're
like a little [ __ ] here
i'm gonna go not the [ __ ] now that i
thought about it some more
and i think it's just you know the the
whole point of this is
i think a parent has a right to
circumvent some of their child's
autonomy for what they feel is in their
best interest
obviously if you take that to their to
the absurd
extreme of like you know you could just
lock him in the room forever then you're
gonna be the [ __ ] but
if you uh if you're doing something
within reason that can establish good
habits for them i think you have a uh
i think you have an impetus i'm going to
say not the [ __ ]
i will also say there's got to be some
kind of compromise
like what about a compromise where like
if he does his homework as soon as he
comes home from summer school
uh like summer school snack
homework gaming why not that that does
the same thing of establishing like a
good habit of making sure that you're
uh you know finishing the work that you
have to do and he's
trying he's making an effort if you i
think if you just take it away from
him you risk uh creating resentment but
at the same time i'm like you know
i'm not saying i'd be above it if it
came to that we'll see
it's one of those things i'm sure it's
like you know
i i'm very wary of this now that i have
a child you know
you're like well if i was a parent i
would simply come up with a rational
plan that we would all sign on the
dotted line and agree to
and there would be a laid out series of
terms if anybody breached the agreement
and as a result we would all agree that
this is fair and equitable and when
you're actually uh
you know you got your own life at middle
aged and then also your teenage son is
like giving you the middle finger i'm
sure you're like yeah we'll
guess who controls like literally
everything in this house
anyway more complicated than i thought
it would be
let's put it that way
am i the [ __ ] for getting mad at my
parents
for selling my video games for
practically nothing
i'm noticing a lot of uh a lot of gaming
based threads this week this is uh
this is a big positive for me this this
is my area of expertise
it it describes uh my my two
passions video games and also judging
other people unfairly
am i the [ __ ] for getting mad at my
parents for selling my video games for
practice
practically nothing i 19 male
live with my parents and we are in the
process of moving to a new house
my parents decided to host a yard sale
and since i wasn't available to help
they asked if i'd be willing to sell
some of my old video games
if they paid me back already
a couple of things here
one is i don't understand why we have an
ad for vip casino
this this scares me
because i consume no casino-based
content
but i do talk about my opinion on
gambling streamers
in our private discord you spying on me
a little [ __ ]
targeted marketing man
i did watch shib that's true still do it
should be ads for
10 million california uh penthouses then
anyway um
get 10 free spins to win a million
dollars
you could just do that you could just
lie
in the ad and by lie i mean you know
presented
reality that is probably like a one in
17 billion chance
but as if like uh it's 50 50 anyway um
moving on so 19 live with their parents
honestly already you might be expecting
like oh they should they contribute
financially to the household they should
pay rent
uh in in a perfect world maybe
but at the same time i'm like 19 is so
young
especially in an era where like young
people have been like
genetic not genetically economically
crushed
uh over and over by both covid and the
great financial crisis
and house prices that have risen
substantially faster than
wages um so i definitely feel like uh
this is a situation if if this goes in a
direction of like you're an adult now
you should have to pay us i'm like well
the parents are [ __ ] but anyway
the thing that is is strange for me is
selling
your kids video games
and then paying him back later
but i guess that maybe just speaks to
the economic reality of the situation
here
anyway i told him it was fine but i
handed them a list of video games i did
not want them to sell
and told them to look up how much the
games are worth before selling them i
didn't expect them to sell a lot
given that most of the games i own right
now cost a small fortune online
all right you i'm telling you
immediately you have
made a mistake if most of the games you
own cost
a small fortune and that insinuates
maybe you're a collector or something
you should not have given your parents
permission to sell
any of them they don't know
they got no idea
my mom is still of the she has like you
know probably 5 000 hockey cards from
the 90s
she still thinks they're gonna be worth
like a million dollars someday like it's
gonna be a nest egg you can retire off
of
you got to be nobody is aware of
everything in the collectibles market
you gotta
you know i think you should have been
there if if you're gonna
you know give them permission for this
oh no when i asked where my games were
i found that nearly all of my gamecube
ds 3ds games had been sold
including one i wrote down on my list
can i can i say something
they shouldn't have sold the one on the
list
but you can't be there you don't have
the justifiability to be upset
about the other ones if the other ones
were not on the list
some of the games cost hundreds of
dollars to buy so i knew my parents
didn't look up the prices like i said
when i called them out on it they said
if they if i wanted things done right
i should have been there and also
mentioned they paid for some of the
games themselves
i've never gotten into any serious
arguments with my parents before but i
told them that
until they gave me what i would have
gotten by selling the games online
which would be over two thousand dollars
i don't want to hear any more of your bs
my mom's acting like nothing happened
but my dad's refusing to talk to me
am i the [ __ ]
uh okay i like that the
the comment is uh under the threshold
so we actually can't see the judgment
i think i'm gonna i'm gonna end up i
guess it's everybody sucks here
i think i'm gonna end up making some
enemies in chat on this one look the dad
might be an [ __ ]
for uh not talking to you i don't know
what's going on with that but that's
like a
a one sentence statement um
so it's hard to glean much from that can
i say though like it sounds like he's
uh you know a video game enthusiast it
sounds like he's a collector
he um gave his parents permission to
sell anything that wasn't on the list
he did tell them to look up the values
in advance
i i think i don't want to say he's an
[ __ ]
i i kind of feel like he just made a
mistake
[Laughter]
if that makes sense i feel like what he
thought he was getting into
was a situation where uh
his he was like hey i can offload some
of these games at market value
because my parents just volunteered to
go look up
the price for all this stuff on ebay and
then sell it for what it's worth at our
garage sale
which by the way i don't know where you
live but i think if you start selling
like you know
a 200 copy of skies of arcadia or
something like that at your garage sale
you're not gonna get many biters i think
you're you're
that's a situation you probably want to
take that straight to ebay
instead of you know putting it behind
glass at your
on your front porch but anyway um
garage sale is not where you go for
market value you know that that's where
you
put out stuff that is priced to move and
gary vaynerchuk shows up and he buys
like some shitty mug from like the 1976
olympics and then he gets in his car and
goes like you see this
you see you and then he looks it up on
ebay and it's like 10 bucks and he's
like i got that for 250
400 gain anyway
um i think is unreasonable of
the video game collector to
assume that his parents were going to do
the necessary due diligence to sell
something at a yard sale
that's just my two i think even his
parents would have been like
okay in that case just keep him um
i also think he can't be mad if
only one of the games on the list was
sold he can be mad about the game on the
list that was sold
but i also don't think uh you know the
other ones he doesn't get to be like
they sold the one game on the list and
the other
30 games that i told them as well um
that i that i said implicitly was okay
so i don't know if he's an [ __ ] i
also feel
like his parents are definitely not
[ __ ]
at all like i don't
i don't see a situation where his
parents could be [ __ ] for anything
except his dad not talking to him right
now
but you know he's mad
i mean his parents did buy him the games
maybe but
he's probably you know like when he's
eight i don't think you can really do
that you could buy your kid like a
christmas gift and then 10 years later
be like oh i bought it for you anyway
but i'm filling in a lot of the blanks
with like a headcanon here
uh because it's only two paragraphs long
which is a brevity that i actually
appreciate to be honest
reread the last two lines i told them
until they gave me what i would have
gotten by selling the games online i
didn't want to hear any more of their bs
yeah i mean uh i don't know if if that's
emotion or or if he's genuinely got that
going on in his head
because i mean it is a situation where
uh you know as a parent i'm like by the
time you get your kid to the age of 19
you've probably invested like hundreds
of thousands of dollars into their
uh upbringing which admittedly like they
didn't ask for but
to to nickel and dime because they sold
your copy of suicide in three
is a little bit uh you know i i think
you don't need to go
into that level of minutiae if that
makes sense
uh i also don't know what it means when
they say i don't want to hear any more
of your bs
[Laughter]
it sounds like if your dad's refusing to
talk to you and your mom's acting like
nothing's happening
uh then it sounds like they're not
giving you bs and as a result you have
achieved what you wanted
anyway um
i will say 19 is young but it is maybe
a little old uh to be getting into this
kind of
contentious discourse with your parents
but
i don't know this is it's this strikes
me as just something that's just
it it's just an unfortunate situation
you entrusted something that you
treasure to somebody who
doesn't know what it's worth and then
when they sold it for less than it's
worth because they think they're
toys you're upset i think you have a
right to be upset but
also in this situation i definitely
don't look at this like the parents did
anything wrong
is basically what it comes down to
i think your parents didn't understand
what the collection was worth to you and
you didn't understand
that for your parents they would
probably like just put that [ __ ] on the
table with like
five dollars or best offer it's
anyway yeah like
i also feel like if you're a collector
like i and maybe this is just me as a
as a person i think i would be like you
know i'd be excited
to put some of the merch out there at
the garage sale and
show up and be like you know let's see
if i can actually sell this to like a
real collector
or or at least like look up the prices
in advance and be like please don't sell
this earthbound for like less than 300
bucks or something like that
anyway just i would say the situation is
uh unfortunate and the reaction is then
over the top but
this this so much this
i'm you gotta you gotta look at uh
some of these posts before you uh before
you click on them
like for example um
this one am i the [ __ ] for separating
my sister
from my nephew
you know let's get spicy
it's a monday i'm i'm ready to go
it's sure it's spelled wrong but
separating is tough
okay that's a tough word
i i never know if you separate with an a
like one is separate and one is separate
my 24 so i always read this wrong man
ops 24 their sister's 35 nephews 13
moved in with me for seven months after
her husband cheated on her and eloped he
is currently absent
she is in financial misery at the moment
that's pretty bad and i don't charge her
for any costs they both have their own
rooms currently just my nephew
i don't know how to read this sentence
and i'm not just trying to be a jerk
about it
what does that mean they both have their
own had their own oh
at one point they had their own rooms
but currently only my nephew
has their own room what happened to the
other room
maybe it's not germane to the point it's
it's locked it's vented
sas okay the problem is my sister
criticized my lifestyle and told me i'm
a bad influence to her son that goes on
for the whole time
to describe myself i am a partner in a
repair service for devices like
smartphones or laptops have very few
friends but which i can trust fully i am
more introverted
not much social i have gaming cigarettes
and energy drink addictions i am
fat slash chubby 108 kilograms 1.83
meters
high okay look can i also say
uh very open with a lot of information
here okay
um i already know where i think i'm
going with this as i'll say
it what i'm gonna say is sure it sounds
like
you might be a little bit of a bad
influence on a 13 year old kid
but it also seems like you're kind of a
good influence on a 13 year old kid by
having the financial
means and the capabilities to take in
your substantially older sister and her
child
which kind of nullifies a lot of the
other stuff i think to some extent
i mean yeah it's his is his house and
his life
i don't have any problems with my nephew
but i teach him my interest if i
interact with him like i disassemble
smartphones show them how to put them
back together think about my work or we
just play pc games and i let him use my
laptop
my sister has problems with it in her
opinion her son shouldn't become like me
the last incident oh no i'm just reading
i i'm my peripheral vision caught pizza
chicken nuggets rick and morty like i i
see
like so many possible hot button issues
coming up
the last instance where i snapped at her
was a month ago
on saturday night i decided to gaming
with pizza chicken nuggets and energy
drinks my nephew has just joined me and
enjoyed his meal
while he watched me playing and binged
rick and morty on smartphone we were up
until 4am
on the next morning i woked up at like 1
p.m
my sister went on a rant against me that
i am an asocial freak
who ruins her child okay i
4am it is a saturday but the kid's 13
like i i can see why this sister would
be a little bit upset by that
she probably should not have called him
any social freak
but that i i would i would think that
maybe the next day i would be like
hey you know my son we're trying to keep
him on like the straight and arrow for
now he's 13 years old
you know he's in seventh grade um if he
could
if you could have him go to bed at
midnight that'd be nice but then also
now that i say that i'm like
why wasn't the sister there to tell the
nephew to go to sleep at midnight or 11
or whatever
instead of relying on the the uncle to
do
it who's only like 10 years older than
the nephew to begin with
that really hurt me because maybe i'm
not as social as other people but i try
to care for my nephew's well-being help
him with school if i have time bring him
shopping
i told her she has to go to our parents
she can't live with me anymore
i have then spoke i've spoken with my
nephew and explained that i cannot stand
my sister anymore and he's welcomed here
whenever he wants
he was furious at my sister sister
packed their stuff and my dad picked her
up but my nephew refused to go with my
sister so basically he is now with me
and we are basically roommates
it's such a good sentence
we're basically roommates it's nothing
weird i'm just yeah
hey that's just my roommate hey he's
learning long division right now give
him
some slack oh
man does he does he
pitch in on the on the rent my parents
and sister told me i should force him to
go but that for me is just cruel and i
refused
okay um that's not right
my nephew is not a difficult child
cleans up after he himself does
does other things if i tell him and
until now he perfectly does his homework
so my sister has to visit us daily to
see her son
she begs me to kick my nephew out but my
nephew just doesn't want to leave and i
don't want to be cruel to my nephew with
kicking him out because he's now in
therapy and just began to improve
am i the ass because i separate my
sister from her child
i don't have a clue what would legally
happen but in the moment we live with
this status quo because nephew's
therapist told my sister not to force
him and he needs stability
wow this is all just a horrible
situation
um
i have no idea what to say
um let's take a
a drink of water first here
let me say i think
the first thing i'd like to say is that
he's it seems like he's being
a good uncle you know my understanding
of the duties of an uncle
you know you're you're kind of like
you've got the responsibility of a
parent
you know for the well-being of the child
but you also
you know you're almost like halfway
between like a parent and a friend but
more on the parents side
is like you i'm trying to think of the
best way to explain it let me put it
this way
you you don't have to maintain the same
kind of authority as an uncle over like
your 13 year old nephew that you do over
your 13 year old child you know
you you you're the boss you're the adult
you're running things but you can also
be like hey you know what you can have
another soda
just don't tell your mom so i think that
he the only thing that maybe crosses the
line
is like letting him stay up until 4am in
my opinion
uh but also you know i mean maybe he
didn't get
a lot of sleep for one night that's not
a good reason to go off
now
kicking your sister out of your house
but allowing your nephew to stay with
you
when it's like safe to go with the mom
definitely seems like kind of a prickly
issue that
you'd want to maybe talk to like a
lawyer or something
i don't know like that's that's a really
tough one
for just an idiot on the internet to
look at it and be like uh
who's right who's in the right and who's
in the wrong here but it's
it's definitely a it's a strange
situation
but let me just say honestly it sounds
like um
it's just a pretty good guy uh
that has gotten himself embroiled in
in a spicy family situation maybe he
doesn't have the healthiest lifestyle
but he also doesn't have a 13 year old
child he's just the
24 year old guy that you know is is
living on his own
and uh you know if he wants to watch
rick and morty and
drink energy drinks and smoke cigarettes
until 4 a.m that's
you're right as a you know a single
person
living alone as an adult with no
dependence you could you could
vibe however you see fit like i mean you
gotta other responsibilities when you're
setting an example for
uh you know your kids and stuff like
that but you know
i i don't think you got to live well
just so your nephew sees
like that it's a good example
yeah you i mean i agree like he
shouldn't be
it's not the best environment for a
teenager to grow up in but i'm also like
i don't know it sounds like your
situation where their mom is totally
messed up as well or with his mom is
totally messed up so
i have no idea um
but that's that's crazy sorry that
happened
uh to you i don't know what to say
i guess he does have a dependent now
yeah he's kind of like
i i don't know i honestly have no idea
um
yeah okay let's put a cork in on that
one he doesn't seem like the [ __ ]
he just uh you know
i don't know what to say he doesn't seem
like the [ __ ]
that's that's what i'll say about that
he might be
committing a felony i don't know if the
therapist advised the child not to leave
i
i'm not qualified to talk about that
sort of that sort of stuff
oh um what was the flare everyone sucks
i think that's fair
i don't i don't necessarily think he
sucks but he's also not
you know above criticism here but if
anything i guess the thing i would say
is i don't think he
deserves criticism for his lifestyle you
know he's doing stuff within the bounds
of the law
and again he's like he's a 24 year old
guy living alone if he wants to
you know torinate himself every day then
then by all means
preferably without the 13 year old kid
living with them but anyway
top golf with pro put full course beta
sign up now
open this does not seem
oculus oculus only we're now taking sign
ups for beta players
for our future feature release full
course golf
it's never too early to give players a
chance to be involved
okay am i the [ __ ] for wearing for
asking my partner
to wear appropriate clothes for a
baseball game every time we have like
uh a an appropriate clothing
based question i realize uh what
percentage of my audience
doesn't live in uh like areas with north
american
fashion norms and i i end up and by the
way which is fine
for the record but i do end up taking
some heat sometimes
from people that are like i live in
malaysia and if you wore that [ __ ] to
the gym here we would
beat you up and i'm like well i don't
live in malaysia
maybe they do i don't know i just gotta
put myself in the shoes
of what i'm familiar with which is that
you know this is
i just assume these all take place like
two blocks away from me
i the [ __ ] for asking my partner to
wear appropriate clothes for a baseball
game
my partner of two years okay so this is
o.p
is the girlfriend and then her partner
is a 26 year old man super into fashion
his aesthetic varies but he loves to
dress up for any occasion he models for
work so he has access to some really
awesome clothes his clothing is
impeccable
and i love his sense of style and
confidence to wear whatever he wants
okay quit bragging
you're the [ __ ] however he has never
met my grandparents in their 80s except
over a handful of family face time calls
so we're taking a trip to their state
seeing my family and specifically having
my partner meet my grandparents
all four of us love baseball so i've
purchased tickets for my grandfather's
favorite team
happens to be the local mlb team the
weekend we are coming
when i told my partner he got super
excited and started planning outfits for
him to wear and get pictures in at the
stadium
i nobody's done anything wrong here at
all
but one of the great things about going
to a sporting event
is you don't have to plan your outfit
you just if you got a jersey you just
put the the jersey on i'm not trying to
flex but there's some times where i'm
like
you know am i am i going to wear the
black skate jersey with no nameplate yet
am i going to wear the uh henrikh sadin
captain jersey because it's you know the
it's alumni night or something but i
mean that only takes like six or seven
hours to figure out okay
normally i would have no issue with
whatever he wore however he was picking
out some of his more expensive items
designer brands printed on them extra
flashy wash
watches and my grandparents are not well
off especially not right now as they're
victims of a pension scam
they will eventually get the money back
but right now they are forced back into
working in our paycheck to paycheck
i asked my partner not to wear designer
clothes so as not to show off to my
grandparents the disparity of wealth is
they have already
i thought he said they sharked their
father and i was like what the heck does
that mean
as they have already shared with my
father they are embarrassed that i'm
paying for our day of baseball together
and that they cannot afford to
contribute anything financially to the
day
forum panda bear thank you for the
gifted subscriptions as well thank you
you can wear whatever you want to the
baseball game aft after the gift subs
this is where things go south i will you
know what this is a
refreshingly rational nobody sucks here
description so far
your boyfriend loves to dress up he he
wants to dress up
you uh don't want him to dress up
because it'll make your grandparents
feel bad about their
you know recently uh made worse
financial situation
seems totally fair so far he claims that
i am not supportive of his
sense of style and because he dresses
sometimes more feminine or androgynous
i'm embarrassed to bring him to the game
with my grandparents
i am not embarrassed i just don't want
my grandparents feeling like they don't
fit in they've seen him on social media
posts in some of the magazine campaigns
he's been in wearing skirts and such
and they've been nothing but excited to
meet him he says i'm an
[ __ ] if he can't wear the clothes he
wants he won't go so am i the [ __ ]
hmm this is a tough one
can i say um i kind of feel like this is
a nobody sucks here
which is kind of just copping the flare
let me let me say something here okay
cause i got burned by this last week and
i've been waiting for an opportunity to
turn it around
i do think it's a little bit
unreasonable
that it seems like you politely asked
your boyfriend to wear
a different outfit for the game and then
he said if i can't wear what i want i
don't want to go
but if we put the shoe on the other foot
and the boyfriend was speaking to the
girlfriend and going hey could you not
wear that
to the baseball game because it might
make my grandparents uncomfortable
i think that people would be like your
boyfriend's an [ __ ] for issuing you
like an
ultimatum like that so or it they would
be like
i understand why she feels like i just
don't want to go at all now
so and it's a pretty on the severity
scale
like this is like a 2 out of 10 [ __ ]
level versus
you know the lady who left her nephew
with her
24 year old brother but anyway um
i can understand even though i don't
care about fashion
at all except for the streamer drip
i can understand you know if you're
especially if you're a model and you
take pride in you know expressing
yourself through your outfit
you're like this is what i want to wear
it's special for me i'm excited to plan
on my outfit and then someone's like
don't wear that wear like you know
blue jeans and a tucked in plaid shirt
you'd be like okay fine then maybe i
just don't want to go
because it's it is trying to stifle some
autonomy to some degree
but let's go down a little bit further
here
this was asked in a private message but
it might shed light on the subject
my partner's family is not well off and
he would never dress the way he wants to
with my grandparents
this behavior is not normal for him
especially because he doesn't often own
the clothes he wears and he specifically
bought these for the trip to wear to the
game
i don't know what that means this uh my
partner's family is not well off he
would never dress the way he wants to
with my grandparents
this behavior is not normal for him so
you think your boyfriend's gone crazy
um i don't get it
i think it's supposed to be his
grandparents
okay maybe it still doesn't make that
much sense to me
um when around his family of a different
belief system than i
i choose to wear modest clothing and
have head coverings for when it's
appropriate
as that is a part of their religion and
want to be respectful they are not
wealthy
do you have everybody's tax returns
why are you familiar with absolutely
every person's financial situation
like i know how i'm doing
and i got like a temperature on like my
parents
and nobody else i don't know how anybody
else is doing on planet earth at all
does she is she an auditor for the irs i
don't
how does she know her boyfriend's i
guess probably because her boyfriend
told her but
um anyway
they are not wealthy and a part of their
religion is not just physical modesty
but also how you present yourself
he never wears work clothes to his own
family functions
this is one of those situations where um
i feel like this person has become
much more invested in being right in the
argument than in actually coming to the
resolution because now instead of like
how do i
which i guess is what i'm that am i the
[ __ ] for to begin with
but instead of being like how can we
resolve this situation
she's like let me keep adding more
context that makes it appear like i'm
obviously not in the uh
in the wrong here i don't know this is
uh
it's a weird one
i feel first off this situation is a not
that big of a deal to begin with
can i say uh something that is uh that
people might take as uh honestly pretty
rude
but your grandparents are in their 80s
i think there's a little like you you
gotta
let your boyfriend wear whatever he
wants and if they're in their 80s and
they're like
he made a bad impression because he's
wearing a 500 t-shirt
like that's kind of their problem
you know like they they've lived through
the cold war
oh my granddaughter's boyfriend is
wearing like a
balenciaga t-shirt like who cares
like you can't keep them safe from
having like a wealth displayed in front
of them like on the drive to the game
they're going to drive by
maybe you know like some super cars or
something like that
don't tell them how much the the players
on the field are making like i think
she's overthinking
uh you know trying to make them
yeah she's she's trying to protect them
from the drip which i don't i don't know
if it's
i think it's it's trying to shelter
somebody who has you know
lived a long life
i don't know i i feel like you know are
you gonna put it put them in a blindfold
or something so they don't see that
there's people around them wearing
yeezys or something like that i don't
know
anyway long story short i i don't
necessarily think anybody's like a huge
[ __ ] here
i don't have the sigma grind set i feel
like if i asked kate like hey
maybe could you change your outfit for
dinner with my parents and she was like
uh
i'll tell you what how about i just
don't go i'd be like you know what you
look great
let's get on the road
[Laughter]
we're already 10 minutes late probably
so we should probably just go anyway
just to me this doesn't seem like that
big of a deal i mean at this point i
feel like if i were the boyfriend i
would resent being in what appears to be
a long argument
over like whether or not i can wear like
this shirt to the
cardinals game it just seems like that
if anything it's like a red flag that
it's
it's such a problem i guess
anyway we're gonna keep it moving
but for now



i'm gonna throw a slash marker in there
let's uh
let's see what else we got here there's
been some good posts this week for sure
emma am i the [ __ ] for blocking my
neighbor from parking his car in front
of my house
oh man this is this comes up in
vancouver all the time i'm sure there's
going to be more info
um so i had to scroll down
um it's this happens in vancouver all
the time
people will like literally put a sign
on their front lawn that's like please
do not
park here i need to park here this is my
house
and i'm like it's it's the street
i'm sorry to tell you like i mean i
i would love to also park in front of my
house at all times
but you don't it's a public road i gotta
go to maybe like my friend's house my
friend lives across the street
i'm gonna park there if that's the best
parking spot it's how she goes
plus you got a driveway usually or or
like a garage
and i'm like you can't what do you got
like six cars get over it
um anyway so maybe i'm the [ __ ] but
let's see
we'll see i've lived in my home oh let's
start with the title of course
oh you don't if you block someone's
driveway that's a different story that
that makes
yta for sure am i the [ __ ] for
blocking my neighbor from parking his
car in front of my house
i've lived in my home since it was
constructed 15 years ago there's 12
houses on our street with six houses on
each side of the street if one of the
houses always lies and all adjacent
houses must tell the truth
how many houses do you need to ask a
question to in order to determine
the correct answer all the houses are
three or four bedrooms with two car
garages my house is the third
from the corner of a public road
three or four three or well is yours
three
or four i would need apparently i need
to know
all of the pertinent details is it
hardwood is it carpeting
what does your banister look like do you
have a wooden banister do you have a
metal banister this is going to change
everything man
okay hold on i'm assuming that the
geography is relevant they're third from
the corner on a public road
the unwritten rule on our street is if
you need to park on the street you park
in front of your house and not someone
else's
makes a lot of sense of course if you
have a get-together or workers coming
over no one minds if you park in front
of their house as long as you're not
making a habit of it
also seems reasonable
the house two doors down from me which
is on the corner with the public road
sold new people moving six adults living
in a three-bedroom house they each have
their own vehicle
okay that's [ __ ]
[Laughter]
six cars one house i can see where
things start to get a little dramatic
here
i wake up the next morning to put the
trash out there's a car parked in front
of my house
there's three other cars parked on the
street one in front of my next door
neighbors
one in front of each of the two houses
on the opposite side of the street i was
a bit annoyed but brush it off expecting
it will be moved soon it wasn't moved
for three days
apparently the new people have the
garage packed so they park two cars in
the driveway and four on the street
i keep my corvette in the garage but i
keep my old beat up in the driveway
along with my wife's car
as after the car moved i parked my truck
on the street in front of my house
later that evening someone rings my
doorbell the guy asked if i can move my
truck into my driveway so he can park in
front of my house i tell him i can but
i'm not going to
he says they have six cars and not
enough room to park on their property i
tell them it sounds like they bought a
property too small for their needs and
shut the door am i the [ __ ]
um
obligatory based based
based owned because there's there's a
there's a multi-faceted issue this is
kind of like this is my bread and butter
because there's no
legality being violated here whatsoever
that makes it a cut and dry situation
it's exclusively in those blurred lines
in the margins of
unspoken human behavior and as they've
said it themselves
unwritten rules right um there's no
reason he should have to move his truck
um in order for them to be able to park
that's for sure
and i also feel like six cars to one
home
is you should be able to buy whatever
you want to buy i think as long as you
can you know support it without
inconveniencing others
but at some point when you got six cars
in one
house surely
you gotta like can you carpool or so can
you sell like two
cars and then carpool a little bit like
it's it's just seems a little
crazy to me like what what are you gonna
do like
that's it at a high enough level of cars
where you're like that's audacious
like one car per person in the home
like you you really can't double up at
all regardless
you know i i
i digress
now so i op i think doesn't have to
mess with things at all you know they
they can they're well within their
rights here can i ask you a question
though
and this is where maybe we're going to
get into some trouble
why if he can park his uh
his car in the driveway
and in the garage why is he so
annoyed that they have
that they're parking in front of his
house
it sounds like his parking situation was
totally fine
it just it annoys him that they're
parking their car in front of his
property
which i can understand like i i think i
would look
out and be like whoa that car's been
here for a while hey come on
but it it seems like parking his own
truck on the street is just something he
did to be like hey
park someplace else because like it's
like you don't you nobody
takes advantage of me even if it doesn't
hurt me at all
so i i kind of see this i don't know man
i mean i was gonna say is everybody
sucks here
but in spite of what i said about uh
about the fact that i don't think he
should care
i will also say like
i don't think he's an [ __ ] for
taking the parking in front of his own
place
i mean even if he didn't want to park
his car in the driveway
and he wanted to just park his car on
the street anywhere he's not really an
[ __ ] he's a little rude maybe
opie has three cars in a four bedroom
house for one person
well i don't know if it's one person for
one but also
if he's got two cars or three cars but
he keeps them all on his property he's
not inconveniencing anybody else
he said he has a wife oh there you go
i mean i don't care if you have like a
thousand cars as long as they're like
you know in the garage or or maybe
parked in front of your place
anyway it's uh i mean i
i think if anything i think you're kind
of an [ __ ]
i understand the economic reality the
situation i suppose
but uh you're kind of an [ __ ] for
moving six people into a three-bedroom
house and
everybody has their own vehicle like
that's just too is there
too many cars tmc like i don't even know
if they're jerks i just feel like
they're
they're that's a tmc there's a too many
cars situation
i and then i actually i'm gonna go a
step further
i think the guy who asked hey can you
move your truck so i can park my car
there
is actually the super [ __ ]
because why don't you just park further
away
like you don't have you don't get
priority access to the parking spot
that's closest
to your house just because of the fact
that like it's closest to your house you
know what i mean
well and you could use that against the
corvette guy i guess but
you know what your inconveniencing or
you're
going to be inconvenienced because you
have too many cars to
fit into your own property just get with
this
is a vancouver special man you know how
many times like i park i look for street
parking to go somewhere and the closest
street parking i can find is like you
know a
three or four minute walk away
so what happens when you got a tmc
situation you got too many damn cars
op didn't have to be a jerk about it
though you know what you know why
in my opinion that he had to uh ben
shapiro this guy
because there's he's he's in the right
on a logical level the argument flows i
think that he's in the right there's no
reason he has to not park his car there
but there's absolutely no like
moral reason that he did it
so he had to like burn he had to
get a burn in there and be like i've
owned you with facts and logic
because otherwise if his neighbor was
just like yeah but you're not really
using it
like why do you care so much then he
would have to look inside of himself
and be like that's a good point i don't
know why i guess it's because
all this stuff the corvette the
three-bedroom house
it's all because i don't like what's
going on in here it's i i try to project
this image of
rugged individualism and ends up
expressing itself in toxic ways like
needlessly parking my car on the street
in such a way to inconvenience others
just because i thought they were taking
advantage of me when really
they probably didn't pay any mind to it
and were just trying to do the thing
that was most frictionless for their own
existence
anyway too many cars though like way way
too many come on six cars three people
or six cars three bedrooms
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting alcohol
at my wedding and suggesting
alternatives
is there any way this could
possibly be the [ __ ]
i it's your wedding and
you can do whatever you want
wait it says [ __ ] okay i gotta i
gotta know more
how did this happen how badly did you
mess up that you end up being the
[ __ ] in this situation
so i male 22 and my fiance female 22
just got engaged we live in southern
california
and plan to get married next june the
issue is catering since i have extended
family in canada and friends in new
zealand i'd like to pay for a decent
reception
my fiance agrees however the problem is
that she said we need to have alcohol at
the wedding i drink extremely rarely and
my immediately family immediate family
barely does
also my extended family doesn't really
drink my fiance said her friends and
family would expect us to have alcohol
because it's the thing to do
i suggest that we have people bring
their own or we can have an after party
with drinks
but she said that if we do not have
alcohol some people might not even come
and it is an absolute necessity
i've just noticed the edit is 40 times
longer
than the actual post itself
that's crazy um this is
it's too far um am i the [ __ ]
for not wanting to have to spend
thousands of extra on alcohol for also
thinking we should go without alcohol
anyway i don't want people to come to a
special wedding to celebrate with us and
just be there for the alcohol
i've been pushing back but she's very
angry with me thoughts
this is gonna be good because right now
not the [ __ ] just uh you know the
kind of thing that comes up when two
people have like a different idea for
what an event is gonna look like
i don't think your fiance is necessarily
out of line for suggesting
you know that i mean different people
have different ideas of what a wedding
is going to look like right
like some people are are going there um
to see like you know their nephew get
married and they're 87 years old
some people are going there because they
went to college with the groom
and they're there to like see their
friend off but also to get
shmammied so like different people are
gonna have different
ideas of what a wedding is gonna look
like i'm sure including the the bride
and the groom
i certainly don't i mean i think if you
have people who are like i'm not gonna
come to the wedding unless there's
alcohol like
then those people you should not be
paying you know like 150 to 300
per head to cater a dinner and get a
venue for them in the first place
[Laughter]
those anybody that would not come to
your wedding
simply because it's dry is probably
somebody that shouldn't be
invited in the first place but anyway so
far seems fairly pedestrian
edit the family and friend from far away
have an interesting
relationship with alcohol as in some
past alcoholics some against it in
general should have cleared that up
i understand you know you again if you
have like you know
either teetotalers or you know
recovering alcoholics in your family
that would make it
an even more tight situation further
edit
the way we were going before alcohol
came up was we were going to rent a
community center and have an outside
caterer come in for the reception the
ceremony is at a different close-by
place i'm from socal and so everything
price-wise is god tier now lol
my fiancee just graduated college and is
starting subbing
i'm entering my senior year i work or
will work 40 to 50 hours a week and she
works hard too
the money aspect is that we are trying
to pay off all our loans by marriage and
afford all these other things she wants
a dog nice apartment etc which i totally
support
our budget for the whole wedding is 10k
not because we're frugal but because
that's literally all we'd have for it so
my money concern is that
since we were able to get everything
including photography food cake dress
etc
getting alcohol too since the community
center would also then require insurance
and security guards since alcohol
ridiculous i know would push us
way over
it you say it best when you say nothing
at all
to be honest i'm surprised by the
absolute necessity of alcohol but if
that's the culture i get it i'm down to
do it but now i'm just in a hard place i
looked it over
the community center requires alcohol to
be from behind the bar
so we can't do bring your own yeah like
i you're only 22 years old but duh
like i don't if you if you're renting a
venue for a wedding i think they're like
hey are you cool if we just like bring
like our own uh
drinks and and food as well um so we
can't do bring your own should i look
for a completely different venue or
caterer to go with the catering drink
options
the starting price of a caterer we're
going with with paid bar would be around
four thousand dollars for open bar they
don't do paid bar for some reason
i apologize to my fiance thanks to
everyone for the con
the comments and concerns none of this
is that bad
i really i thought this was gonna be
explosive
um but it's actually like a pretty
normal situation i'm very surprised to
see
that uh
that they've been listed as the [ __ ]
we accidentally went to the normal
subreddit this is not the filtered one
so i got to read the comments
so does your desire not to drink
supersede her right to serve alcohol
maybe if alcohol was a trigger for you
if you had a drinking problem but just
out of a sense of frugality
this seems to jump into the realm of
just being cheap you're the [ __ ]
i've never disagreed with like a top
comment more in my entire life
i i mean like
[Laughter]
i just i'm why it's so dramatic
your desire to not drink supersede her
right to serve
alcohol look it sounds like it's not
just a desire to not drink it's also a
desire
to you know save maybe four thousand
dollars on the catering
which is a concern with some relevance i
say
that being said i will also say if your
fiance
you know if her dream wedding has always
involved like some kind of
component of alcohol i mean that's why
you shouldn't have brought it to the
internet in the first place but i'm glad
you did
it's the situation you shouldn't let
reddit get involved
i don't see why people seem to think
they need an open bar in the uk paying
for drinks at weddings is pretty common
or the couple put x amount behind the
bar and then the guests pay for
themselves once that runs out
in the usa it would be between very and
extremely tacky to have guests buy drink
from the bar at your wedding
they could just serve beer if they
wanted or serve a limited amount of
drinks i've been to both but never a
wedding that asked me to pay for the
drinks
dude i'm every like day that goes on
i'm so happy that kate and i basically
just got married
by like uh an officiant at a restaurant
and then like ate lunch and took a nap
i guess i i should it's not like oh we
made such an incredible decision i guess
we're just lucky that we were
both aligned when it comes to that to
begin with
but i can't imagine like
the i the idea that it's tacky to buy
drinks at an open bar
or to to ask people to buy drinks at
your wedding
i mean like i went to josh's wedding
okay there were like 200 people there
maybe maybe more you're catering a
dinner
plus drinks for 200 people i don't mind
like i'm i'm first off i'm very thankful
that josh
invited me and i'll and invited kate as
well
but then like some of the people that
were there you're like i don't mind
catering at dinner
for like my uncle and my aunts and my
cousins and of course my parents
and you know my close friends but then
when you get into
uh this person you know they met you
when you were 12 they were 50 it's your
great uncle brian
also your great uncle brian had just
started dating
somebody three months ago and by the way
she's got like an eight drink minimum
you're like you at that point you're
you're maybe paying like 200 bucks
for this lady you've never met to like
eat and and drink on your dime like i
don't
i'm not say i think it's too easy to be
like oh you're just being cheap i'm like
this
is a lot man open bar doesn't need to be
expensive though ours was like
500 bucks including a bartender that is
it's not expensive
when you know consider the amount but it
it's like it must scale right
it's not like there's a it's 500 and
then if people drink 2 000
worth of alcohol you just got you know
everything for 75 percent off
yeah have you considered that everything
is uh god to your prices here in socal
lol by the way
anyway
just moving just moving yeah what about
a cash bar with like two drink tokens
that doesn't buy i i don't mind paying
for like you know
somebody i don't know to have like
two johnny walkers or something like
that but
if somebody if somebody comes up to
you know they're drinking 15 shots of
vodka
and they barely know us i'm like that
that's where i'm i'm just wondering why
it's such a norm
that being said for the record if kate
and i
ever like renew our vows and have like a
more traditional ceremony
we're not gonna cheap out we're gonna
maybe even three drink tokens per guest
and i think we could invite upwards of
like eight to twelve people
so i'm just saying i might be a little
bit of a hypocrite but
no chad's definitely not invited people
are saying it's your wedding it's your
choice but it's also your fiance's
wedding and she wants the alcohol i
don't drink but i know people expect
alcohol at weddings they get crazy about
it
your fiance likely just wants to make
her guests happy it's hard to give a
judgment on this
i think that's fair that that all seems
fair to me
i don't think that either op
or uh opgf are the
[ __ ] necessarily sounds like she just
wants to put on a wedding that's going
to be amenable for the people that she
invites
what is the [ __ ] i think here is the
uh
the fact that wedding culture at least
in north america is that like
you know there absolutely has to be an
open bar
otherwise like what a disaster
i think a cash bar is like i mean isn't
a cash bar like the most implicitly
fair situation to begin with if you
don't want to drink you don't pay if you
want to get hammered you pay through the
nose
and also i mean just when you look at it
through
and we're not even doing react court
here now i'm just going off
but like the couple is already facing
like a substantial
financial burden for throwing an event
that's basically like a
you know we say we repeat a couple of
words like we're doing the cha-cha slide
then we eat a meal then we're doing the
cha-cha slide
um and then you're like by the way
pay for everybody to get hammered and
then you're like well this seems like a
little much they're like i bought you a
bread maker
so you got to pay for me to get hammered
otherwise it would be tacky you don't
want to be tacky would you
if anything you should be throwing a
cash bar
to be and like hey every two bucks from
every drink purchase goes back to the
bride and groom for throwing this sick
party
but i i don't think the world's ready
for that one yet
i don't i don't know if planet earth is
is ready for this one also you're 22 as
asking a 22 year old to pay for an open
bar
like they they only legally were able to
start drinking like a year ago it seems
like they're committing a crime
they went from not being able to buy
alcohol to being able to buy an
unlimited amount of alcohol
anyway am i the [ __ ] for getting sad
at my boyfriend because he asked me to
knock every time i come in
oh man
deleted
i gotta know
deleted well you i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna pry any deeper than that
but
it's there's gone they even deleted
their account man
am i the [ __ ] for not inviting my
fiance's siblings to the wedding
[ __ ] dude a lot of wedding based ones
too
i'm not gonna go to the wayback machine
and
screw them to figure out you thought you
could delete this [ __ ]
absolutely not i guarantee the kind of
person that would ask their girlfriend
to knock before they entered
um is the kind of person that probably
is a turbo redditor and i bet they found
it that's my head canon
comments always have a backup they keep
the mfn thing on them
my uh 34 and i 28 are getting married in
february of next year we have always
liked the idea of a child free wedding
look so i just
spent like
15 minutes being like it's your wedding
you can do whatever you want
now you you've come up with like the one
counter example let me say okay
you can have a child free wedding if you
want
okay if you wanted to be like adults
only for whatever reason
more power to you however
you should invite like nine people
because otherwise you're gonna end up
like if we got invited to
a child-free wedding they were like no
kids
like now i'm like just to go to your
wedding i gotta like
pay a babysitter like a hundred dollars
that no kids at the ceremony is also is
strange i mean you would
the thing is we'd have to be like close
friends you know for me to accept that
so i would i would probably
we'd be much more likely to just say no
anyway like
here's here's what i'm getting at okay
now my fiance comes from a large family
and has six siblings under the age of
18.
first off holy [ __ ]
you have six your fiance is 34
they have six siblings under the age of
18.
that's crazy um by the way
you have the right to do whatever you
want to do in that realm
but my god that's uh
that's kind of staggering six siblings
at all
is uh is a decent number for sure
six under the age of 18 is is kind of
crazy
um anyway uh what was i saying um
you i mean i i gotta read the whole
thing okay
but yeah i think if you're getting
married and you're like oh we're not
having kids so
i'm not inviting six of your younger
siblings
yeah this is kind of a dick that's me
you can you not just have like
a i don't know i feel like it's one of
those things where i'm like you can't
have your cake and eat it too or at
least it's gonna be hard
you know if you've always wanted to have
a child free wedding
and simultaneously you have six siblings
between the ages of 9 and 18
you are a little stupid and naive
quite frankly unless unless you're going
to elope to las vegas with
get married by elvis with nobody in the
audience like
how are you going to get that one
accomplished
anyway uh we are also having an open bar
and while we don't plan on being sloshed
we can't speak for others wink wink so
we just don't
think it's the best environment for kids
to be in plus parents deserve a night of
fun
yeah i've always thought that as a
parent i deserve a night of fun
where the insinuation is i will get so
irresponsibly intoxicated
that it wouldn't be a good environment
for children to be in
you know why why would we want children
to be at a dance
where alcohol is served what are you
going to do are you going to
i don't would you start taking craps on
the floor i don't understand
anyway by the way thank you also for for
choosing uh as well for the
pa and i get that i'm biased as we have
a you know a child but
thanks for choosing for me that i can't
just uh
bring my child and then you know one of
us chooses to be the dd and the other
one can cut loose a little bit instead
it's literally not allowed
really appreciate that anyway our first
battle was choosing not to have my
goddaughter
who is seven as the flower girl because
of our no child policy
you're going to get a there's no
exception made for the
uh the flower girl
you're gonna have a flower girl who's
over you're at your
child free wedding you're gonna have a
flower girl but she's got to be over the
age of 18. it's a job that is
predominantly done by
like a four-year-old okay now
my okay she was upset because of our no
child policy
what an [ __ ] um my sister was upset
at first about her
her daughter being left out but finally
came around to a kid-free idea
sister not the [ __ ] now my fiance
comes from a large family and still has
six siblings under the age of 18 their
ages are between 16 and 9.
he said early on if we are doing a child
free wedding we are not making
exceptions for
anyone however when we told his parents
the kids weren't invited they were quick
to snap back and say we were out of line
for not including them
we explained ourselves and explained how
we wanted them to actually enjoy the
night rather than worry about kids all
night
okay i mean it does get more complicated
two of his siblings are tube fed
non-verbal and do not do well with
crowds of people
it that definitely took a turn
his parents fought on insist
can i can i say something though i feel
like
two of like this is kind of a jerk
move from the for the fiance to say
also
it's her unless i'm misreading this okay
it's it's their wedding
and they can kind of do whatever they
want
but not inviting
your fiance is like really
ill siblings
because you think they're gonna have a
bad time
puts you on a moral low ground for sure
like if i get that it's your
wedding you should get whatever you want
but they just want to like
watch if anything if you could make a
situation
to make it a little easier for them to
watch or or less
you know less triggering for them that
might be for the best
anyway sorry let me let me keep reading
it just keeps getting more complicated
we explained ourselves explain how we
wanted to enjoy the night uh they
brought up his older sister
who just had a baby needs to be able to
bring her child we once again
said no at least
they are sticking with their principles
and not making exceptions that's
that gives them some moral consistency
at least
we sent out invites and made sure to
list two seat on his parents
invitation once again we are at war
and are being told we're wrong we have
already told other family members no
children permitted and we don't want to
look like we're picking and choosing
which kids can come so are we the
[ __ ] here
this is something where i think you well
let's read the edit
i'm seeing a lot of comments about
inviting kids to the ceremony and not
the reception
and while that in a perfect world which
obviously we don't live in because we're
at war would be a great compromise
this is a destination wedding
also they do have their own care
providers for the kids and they've
traveled with them before when they did
family vacations
or they just have the wait hold on
you're so you do
it was not just
driving to the church going to the
banquet hall
and then going home to your kids that
night
you're you're flying to cancun or like
cabo san lucas or something like that
and you're either leaving your kid
at home in the states at which point
you've got like i don't know either
family or like a live-in babysitter for
a few days
or you're paying for a plane ticket to
fly your kids to the destination wedding
at which point they can't go to the
wedding
it sounds like they want to go wait hold
on they did family vacations or just
have the older kids help out it sounds
like they want to go for the latter for
this trip so it's totally possible
they're not having it
this is crazy i mean i think you're
you can be in the right
and still be an [ __ ] if that makes
sense
i think it on your wedding you know
there's a day where you and your spouse
can choose
you can experience the day however you
want it you know but as soon as you
start
wanting other people to come
a little bit of compromising is in order
if you want them to come and be happy
about it
but at the end of the day you do have
you know the final say on what's
acceptable at your wedding and what's
not
so if you want to have a complete child
free wedding then by all means
uh a child free destination wedding
where you want other people to come and
just figure out a way to deal with their
kids for like a few days
i mean that seems like that's that would
be one of the easiest no's of my life i
guess is what i would say
you know you my personal philosophy and
not everybody is going to agree with
this
but is like you should make the wedding
is about you and your spouse in a
celebration of that
but you also
want people to jump through like as few
hoops as possible
to be there if that makes sense
like i i am on a razor's edge to saying
no to just about any
social engagement at all if if they i
got invited to a wedding i'd be like
great let's go if they were like you got
to wear a suit i'd be like
fine if they were like it's a willy
wonka themed wedding and you're going to
we'd prefer the suit would be purple i
would be like i
got plants that day i'm sorry there's
like one
you can add in like one or two
conditions
everybody has to wear slippers oh that's
kind of cute it's
and funny glasses i'm like i no no thank
you
so and this is a hundred times worse
than that
this is just an [ __ ] wedding
the final verdict is [ __ ]
i can't believe there's a no [ __ ]
here but anyway
but it doesn't it it i think it makes
them an [ __ ] but simultaneously
again they have the right to do whatever
they want to do right like
that being said you can still be an
[ __ ]
like you could yell really loudly in
your cell phone in like a quiet
restaurant
it's not illegal but you're kind of the
[ __ ]
you already know the the demo it's not
the [ __ ] because like it's your day
and also on reddit people are like i
hate kids
like i get that look
i am not i'm an only child so you know
i've been able to be very flexible or
inflexible my whole life because like
you know whatever i want to cook myself
for dinner especially as an adult i was
like i'm good
um but like if you got like nine
siblings
or something six siblings between nine
and 18 like
you might have to make some compromises
if you want your family to be a part of
your big day
like i know the way people would look at
this is like
uh the sister what a [ __ ] she just had
a baby and now she wants to bring her
baby
to the wedding and it's gonna maybe cry
and it's gonna ruin
my day okay i mean babies do be crying
there's no doubt about that
but as someone who just had like a
newborn
less than a year ago you know especially
in the first couple of months when
they're out
they need to like you know they need to
be around the parents at all times
they they might cry for sure
but you know they poop 10 times a day
they
you know need to nurse constantly so
like if you if you want your sister to
come to the wedding you're gonna also
need to allow the baby to be there it's
not like she's just
gonna leave it at the hospital or
something
which i can i say this is another great
reason to invite like
six people to your wedding it really
simplifies the problem
my wedding was like me kate
and our parents and kate's grandma
that's it
it was it was easy no babies because we
you know there was
nobody of a baby age even involved with
it whatsoever we had a child free
wedding
what we didn't do is be like you know
let's invite a hundred people and tell
them they can't take their newborns
anyway
um i don't know bad person [ __ ] i
don't know am i the [ __ ] for
villainizing my husband deleted
okay am i the [ __ ] for uh
refusing to pay property tax on a condo
i have no legal ownership of
this for this to get 500 upvotes there
must be something juicy here
because this seems like such an obvious
no
oh no i i got to the the main threat
again
uh am i the [ __ ] for refusing to pay
property tax on a condo i have no legal
ownership of
a little context my wife and i received
a very large sum of money from her
parents to use as a down payment on a
new property
hey jay call off the dogs
call off the dogs chad we don't know yet
we haven't don't judge them based on the
fact that they received help from their
parents
we should be happy for them until they
get interviewed
by bloomberg about how to pay for their
home and
you won't believe how this 24 year old
paid off for student loans i
you know ate ramen noodles for every
meal i uh
made sure to uh get day olds from the
donut shop so that i didn't have to buy
any doughnuts and also my parents gave
me 750
000 until they do that we don't we don't
judge them we're happy for them we'd all
like to be in the same situation
i wasn't in a financial position to
commit to a mortgage because i'm a
student okay
three words later or something like that
i'm already like
if if your wife's parents
give you money for a down payment
you gotta use it to buy a house
that's the catch okay i don't know if
that's where it's going
it sounds like it got a lot of money to
make a down payment
and then he was like i don't want to get
into that sort of commitment and i'm
hoping he didn't buy like a bunch of
bubba coin or something but
um while i have a little bit of income
through scholarships and part-time work
it's nowhere near enough to commit to
that kind of purchase my wife decided if
i didn't want to commit to a mortgage
she would just buy the property herself
and use the income from her other
property that her parents bought for her
that she rents out to pay for the new
condo okay i
regret um putting myself as a human
shield here
i my own personal thoughts
notwithstanding i think it let him have
it
oh i don't feel comfortable paying a
mortgage myself personally
oh that's fine uh i'll just buy it then
and i'll use the income from the other
suite to pay off the mortgage
called pulling yourself up by your
bootstraps sweetie
the condition to this was that i had to
sign away my legal ownership of the new
property
as i would not be paying for it i agreed
we already have a prenup that this just
continued to
the trend of keeping our finances
separated
after closing on the property and moving
in my wife informed me she needs me to
start paying the property tax
as a form of rent for me living there
with her
hold on so i'm just i'm
this is when two libertarians get
married i'm trying to put myself into
the mindset okay
i'm i'm trying to get myself in their
shoes
i don't even understand the situation
okay so we have
wife wife has rich parents the parents
bought wife
uh income property
okay i'm on the i'm on the level right
now
they also gave wife and husband
the money to buy or to pay for a down
payment on their own house to live in
okay husband said that's a lot of
commitment
i don't want to be a part of that wife
said i'll just buy it and
all pay the mortgage with
the income that the other people are
grinding themselves to the bond for for
my income suite
uh all right but husband and wife are
living in property too all right i
understand
now wife wants husband
to pay rent in the form of property tax
as penance for living in the house can i
tell you something
despite what i just said and despite the
fact that it's
insane to ask your husband to pay rent
i'm actually like almost
a little bit on her side just because
like they are both living in the place
and she whether or not she's earning the
money
she is taking part of her
income to pay the living expenses for
both of them
in a house that they share it does sound
oh i'm getting minus two out the gourd
wait no okay immediately chad raised
like 17 good points
one of them is he doesn't have any legal
ownership
that is true because he doesn't have
legal ownership why should he have to
pay for any part of the house
well because he lives in it but then
that's not your wife that's just a
landlord
which you could kind of have
a little of both but it okay it's weird
it is a little weird yeah um
i don't know let's see where this goes
it's all it's spicy already
um anyway after closing on the property
my wife informed me i need to start
paying the property tax
as it is the form of rent for me living
there with her
and while we've been splitting rent our
whole relationship it rubs me the wrong
way that she
had me give up ownership on the property
but then expects me to help pay for the
pardon me the property the money going
towards the taxes may as well be going
towards the mortgage
well sir i can see you're not an
accounting uh
student because even if you're paying a
mortgage you are definitely
also paying your property tax still but
you know i i digress
is i'm just saying it's not an
apples-to-apples comparison
at that point what is the point of me
giving up ownership instead of just
owning the condo together
ffs we've been married for years i feel
like i'm being financially exploited i
don't make much money
over the summer since i'm not attending
summer classes and she knew that going
into
she knew that going into it but in order
for her to cover what she owes to the
bank
she even demanded that i give her the
300
my parents gave me for my birthday
bruh oh no no
when your girl boss wife landlord
demands your birthday money you got from
your parents
oh man um
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to pay um
this is a tough one
let's read more previously when we were
splitting ren we each paid 1100 bucks
when she agreed to buy the condo i
agreed to pay for the insurance and all
the utilities
okay she wants me to pay her hundred
dollars
every month on top of all the utility
splitting food
etc where on earth
is uh
your property tax is fourteen hundred
1400 a month
this is like 18 000 a year
property i mean when you put it that way
and the fact that they paid 2200 for
rent
i mean i guess maybe they just live in
like an expensive city
yeah and and then property taxes is high
and maybe their place is worth like
seven or eight or nine or a million or
something like that
anyway that's that's a lot in vancouver
property tax is disgustingly low
like it's unless you have like a vacant
property
i mean for you to be paying 1400 a month
i think you would need to own like a
like a 9 or 10 million dollar house but
that's which is why i always laugh when
people here complain about property
tax yeah i gotta pay like you know
three thousand dollars a year for my
five million dollar house it's crazy
anyway long story short let's keep it
going i feel like i need to explain
better this should be good
i'm still stunned that their property
tax is fourteen hundred dollars
anyway whatever uh i was never expecting
to not pay anything
we each have separate bank accounts but
also a mutual bank account
she uses her personal account for the
rental income from her
other property i use my personal account
for my disability income from the va
any income that i would have saved by
not paying rent
would be put in one of the joint
accounts
my problem is that this is taking money
from our joint bank account
and putting it into her personal account
to then be transferred to the bank for
the mortgage
or to pay property taxes or whatever the
hell whatever the else
my brain is dead whatever the hell else
she wants to do with it
well um
look i don't have this situation
uh so it's hard to relate to you know
we're
we uh basically just pool everything
and this is very complicated i mean i
think this is one of the reasons that
like
i wouldn't want to do this
because it seems kind of uh like there's
a a
weird accounting system and also
uh like maybe a power imbalance as a
result of it
it's just it is a very weird energy for
for a married couple
i'm not saying you can't keep your
finances separated to some extent when
you're married
but also like isn't there
like uh
like legally speaking whatever they're
doing isn't it just
oh because they have a prenup never mind
okay i was gonna say like i mean you can
keep your finances as separate as you
want but i'm pretty sure like after
you've been married for six months in
the eyes of the law is 50 50 depending
on where you live but then again i also
don't know that
[Laughter]
either way i'm like uh
i do understand what the guy is saying
in the sense that
it sucks that he is not
going to uh be getting any equity
but is expected to pay the property tax
however
i do also and this is
merely from a business standpoint this
is this is
ignoring the fact that they're married
[Laughter]
but like
she is paying i know that technically
it's
the tenants that she has that are paying
or her parents
but she on if you treat her as an
entity financially she is paying
for the living arrangement now she's
getting equity out of it as well
it sounds like she would rather be like
i mean just my two cents
i would like to think that if i had this
relationship i would be like
you're my husband i'm not going to
charge you rent
but apparently she is a ruthless
objective capitalist and and she goes
over the balance sheet in the income
statement
every month and and then goes uh
you know hey this freeloader is he's
taking 1400 bucks a month out of my
pocket
he's trying to live here without you
know helping us out at all
um yeah you know what
you're absolutely right it sounds like
he should he should move out
and then expose himself to the free
market of rental inventories and see if
he can get a better deal
and then maybe if he gets an agreement
for that he can bring it to his wife
landlord and be like are you willing to
match this offer
i'm not willing to pay you 1400 a month
for the property tax
however i did just find a studio
apartment across town for 900 bucks
if you're willing to meet me in the
middle and you match that offer then i
would be happy to uh
to consider it you know two can play
that game
anyway they're kind of like um
i don't know if this is everybody sucks
here i gotta read some replies but i'm
like
i mean i do love that
i mean i hate to be this guy this is
like a huge punch down
but i'm going to do it anyway because i
never learned but like
you know you're married to somebody
you're you're you're in your late 20s
and she's like hey could you give your
parents
the money your parents gave you for your
birthday to help with the household
expenses
and he's like this is outrageous
i get it you know it's you're on a fixed
income and your parents have given you
some money for fun
but like this is part of being an adult
and having some some responsibilities
i told her no anyway
not the [ __ ] your wife inherited
family funds
to acquire the property and has paid the
mortgage with the income from the other
separate property
a demand for you to pay the property
taxes
would in fact constitute a co-mingling
of funds on the condo
and it would become a marital property
that this may be a lawyer i refuse to
argue with them
they said the word co-mingle and marital
property
that makes sense though it definitely
seems like
if you pay the property tax on a house
you are entitled to some equity however
simultaneously all that means i think
is that the wife needs to pay the
property tax but then just
draft a separate arrangement to start
charging rent she needs to get him to
sign a lease
instead of being like hey i need 1400 a
month for property
tax she needs to be like i'll pay the
property tax but rent is 1400
a month
what do you mean i'm the ass i'm just
i'm
i'm just trying to separate the the
legalese here okay
hold on hold on hold on this
hold on hold on i was coming to say
you're the [ __ ] until i saw what
she's asking you to pay
property taxes on my house are 4k a year
so i was thinking on a condo she's
asking you to pay
under 2k a year which would be
reasonable since you don't pay rent 1400
a month for property taxes though is the
condo one mount olympus
otherwise she's trying to get you to pay
your mortgage for a place you have no
legal claim to
and you you're already covering all the
utilities no not the [ __ ]
i mean 1400 a month it stood out to me
too
based on your update sounds like she
forgot about taxes when she did her
budget and now wants you to pick up the
slack
it's also rude to change the agreement
and demand your birthday money
i know it's not fair it's just the
expression birthday money
when when you're talking about somebody
like over the age of
you know 15 is doesn't make it
fun to laugh at but it's just you don't
hear it that much i guess is what i'm
trying to say
um anyway imo couples should have fair
fine
finances not equal finances if you make
a third of what she does you should pay
33
of shared expenses no way in hell you
should be paying more than she is
i well yeah i mean especially because
she's got the equity
not the [ __ ] oh wow okay let me
now we're getting into straight up like
legal situations
all right i think we got we have time
for one more these have been these have
been pretty spicy i wish that wasn't
deleted but
i respect them
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to pay an
artist for her work
the fact that this has come as a not the
[ __ ]
is very intriguing to me
oh this is a long one this
is a long one
oh look at it's like seven edits dude
okay so i know this sounds bad am i the
[ __ ] for refusing to pay an artist
for her work
i know this sounds bad but i genuinely
don't think i'm at fault here so i'm
currently planning to get my apartment
repainted completely since i've just
moved in
and all the walls happen to be white i
was talking to a friend about this when
she told me oh my god did she paint some
messed up stuff on the walls
i i can't wait i was talking to a friend
about this and you told me he had a
friend who had just recently graduated
art school and was really
into wall painting i told him i didn't
want any wall painting done because i
had already planned out most of the
coloring scheme
i get i i need to get to the point here
real quick but
um it's kind of a red flag i think when
some when you're like i'm a painter oh
really like what do you paint
walls
i was expecting it to be like you know
watercolors or something like that
i didn't think walls um
anyway he told me his friend was looking
for places to practice wall painting
because she's new to it
and hasn't really found places she could
do it without it being vandalism so i
called her up we had a chat i said
i don't mind letting you paint the walls
of my bedroom because i'm busy for the
next few days and it isn't a common
living space i checked with my painters
they told me they could easily paint
over that
they're not free for a couple of weeks
so i haven't moved in yet but i told him
to ask his friends to go nuts in my room
without scraping or causing any damage i
told her that her work would be painted
over
she said she's simply doing it for the
practice and wouldn't mind as long as
she could take some pictures for her
portfolio
and that i would be doing her a huge
favor letting her practice
okay um so far this seems like
a prelude to the classic statement no
good deed goes unpunished
you know you gain nothing out of it
she gains a practice studio and then
here's where it all goes wrong
so fast forward a couple weeks i go to
my room it's absolutely amazing
with a bunch of designs and a lot of
edgy art so i decided i wouldn't get it
painted over
problem is i have a contract with my
painter and still have to pay him for my
room even if he doesn't do the job
i called her and told her the room was
great and i'd be recommending her to
anyone who asked who painted my room
she then out of the blue asked me how
much i'd be paying her for the work
i told her about my painter situation
that i would have paid her the amount i
was paying him if i didn't have a
contract she got mad and told me i was
taking advantage of a young artist
she's literally three years younger she
said she'd sue me for payment and i
reminded her of our agreement
she said that was done on the basis i
wouldn't be keeping it i told her i was
doing her a favor by giving her a place
to practice i never had any monetary
obligation
she blew up at me and called our mutual
friend so i exchanged i explained my
situation how i simply don't have the
funds
but he thinks i'm an [ __ ] too so
reddit am i the [ __ ]
do we have to have like a landlord one
followed by like an artist
not getting paid because like i know
that i'm
on the chat side in this genuinely in my
soul
sometimes there are little contextual
details in these stories that make it uh
something that can be argued over it
sounds like
in the story look in principle artists
should be paid for their work
and in practice they should be paid for
their work and probably paid more than
they are
that being said if the arrangement was
set up
you get to have a practice space
and i'm not good because you in some
situations you might even charge for a
practice space
but anyway i digress
and then you you get paid in the ability
to you know hone your craft for however
long
no other finances are exchanging hands
and then you ask for money later that
makes op not the [ __ ]
now
could because i'm like is it king
solomon the one that's like there's two
people that think they're the they claim
to be the mother of the baby
and then uh the one they're like okay
well they split the baby in half
like i don't remember how the story ends
it can't be
anything but a gruesome tale um but i'm
like well
it was under the impression
that it was going to be painted over
so i do think that if the artist is not
going to get paid
they still have the ownership of the art
to the extent that they can force it to
be paid over
or painted over i should say
if if you make something cool with your
art to practice with
and then they decide hey like i want to
keep it in my room now i think you could
be like
give me you know a couple hundred bucks
or i'd really like you to paint over it
because who knows you know like one day
this could be worth well i don't know i
mean it's a it's a ridiculous like
argument to objectivism but you know
that was the
that was the the terms of the agreement
so if you want to adhere to them then we
should adhere to them
you could also just pay it over to
spider i guess
or paint it over i don't know why i keep
saying pay it over
you know i kind of look at it like um
you know she she create she might have
if if you had originally drafted the
agreement
and the agreement was like hey you can
practice
in my room i'll probably paint over it
but if it's good i'll keep it then the
artist might have been like you know
what
in that case if you keep it all i ask is
that you pay me
a couple hundred bucks or whatever if
you paint over it no big deal i'm not
going to charge you but if you decide
that you like it
please give me a tip or something like
that that would that would have solved
this but anyway
um where where the heck was i here edit
i never wanted my room
to be painted by an artist and don't
have the money to get it done
professionally
can i just say this is the reason uh
you just say no to everything
maybe this makes me a [ __ ]
there were times occasionally i'll get
almost like a ridiculous request via
email
um someone will be like hey you know can
you
hop on like a call for 10 minutes we'll
talk about this 10 minutes is nothing
this is what i'm worried about i'm
worried that you're a damn liar
and this quick 10 minute call is gonna
result in an email like 18 months from
now that's like my business
failed thanks to you and now you're
gonna pay
like this this is why you should say no
to almost everything especially if it's
not your idea
no no all good deeds uh no good deeds
remain unpunished
anyway moving on i never wanted my room
to be painted by an artist i don't have
the money to get it done professionally
i thought i'd keep it because it looks
great
and i could recommend it to other people
who saw it about her
edit i did not charge her anything for
letting her use my walls for practice
yes word you know
neither of these make op's case any
stronger i'd say
i didn't commission her to do it i
didn't even give her any guidelines
except not to scrap the walls
this was supposed to be letting her
practice and make a portfolio
i wasn't trying to connor okay so i i
actually have a lot of sympathy for op
because there are people on earth who
have never left
uh the confines of their bedroom
and all of their lived experience comes
second hand from reading things on the
internet
and it's like you end up with these
situations where there's absolutes like
literally you're trying to exploit this
artist and i can understand why
uh she's probably getting way too many
uh
hate comments that being said these are
not looking
these these are not making her look any
better but anyway
i wasn't trying to con her for [ __ ]
sake
i thought it wouldn't hurt me to let her
practice since i was going to be
repainting
anyway i didn't originally plan on
keeping the yard
yeah but you kind of are now
though you can see like you're you're
simply leaving the door
open just enough for for her to have
something to argue with if you're just
like fine i'm painting over then i think
it's okay
then i think nobody would be like you're
the [ __ ] but um
i was thinking of paying her a token
amount whatever i can but now i'm torn
because i think that would actually give
her grounds to sue
she does not have the right to claim
ownership or intellectual property
rights of the art right now i checked
but i don't want to get myself
into more hot water for trying to do a
good thing
the painters were contract there's so
many edits and are being paid for me
reserving their time
at least from what i understand it's too
late to cancel any charges
yeah like i don't know maybe i'm just
cut from a different cloth i'm like why
even post the thread
i'll just paint over it and the painters
are going to be there anyway
turn it into an nft yeah i think i think
you have an ultimatum
i think you can you can pay her and keep
it that's the right thing to do
or you can paint over it and be in the
moral right and not pay her anything
and i think that's it if you want to
keep it
you should at least like you know give
her a little something you don't have to
but you should
i think that o.p is upset that she
thought the artist would be flattered
that she liked her work but instead
is now just the situation where it's
like you know
she's not even she didn't even say thank
you that i want to keep her work
the verdict is not the [ __ ] i do
think that's fair though
can i can i read some of these comments
please
just just give it a moment
what the heck is this is a shooting star
on this comment
so she was happy to use the space for
practice and no pay when she thought
you'd be erasing it and now you're
keeping it she wants compensation
that doesn't make sense to me like you
said you did her the favor of providing
a blank space to work in and since
you're out of pocket for paying the
painters for the room they aren't
painting anymore i'd say not the [ __ ]
she is still getting her portfolio piece
and you'll be advertising
look i don't think is that
bad
i i do agree in principle the thing is
like
not no other like services have
changed hands it's a dif it's it's a
strange thing but it's like
you know if i what here's the situation
okay and
this is the worst analogy but i'm i'm
laughing my ass off thinking about it
imagine you had like two bites of your
sandwich left
right and then you were like hey can you
throw this
in the garbage for me and then you
handed it to someone
and then they ate it instead of throwing
in the garbage
would you be like oh no harm no foul
yes that's what i would do is it
possible that someone would be like
are you gonna pay me 50 cents for those
two bites of sandwich because i was of
the impression that you were gonna throw
it in the garbage
destroying it for both of us but instead
you ate it and thus are receiving some
value from it
even though it fundamentally didn't
change what i thought was going to
happen to the sandwich in the first
place don't you think it's fair that i
get
some compensation for the value that
you've derived from this
i don't know i actually don't know
but it's a funny it could be a good
sketch comedy show
when you think about that oh no
this this right here op
simply tell the artist to make her happy
you'll be repainting the room then
take as much time as you need to decide
what would be even better than the paint
that you have
right now a year to malicious compliance
everyone on reddit is like
being a good person
and like making this situation happy for
everybody if possible
that would be great but you know would
be even greater owning
somebody on a petty technicality keeping
their
art and also not paying them because
they didn't read the fine print on the
contract we didn't sign
first i would wish for more wishes hold
on
hold on my oh my oh my oh my
what happened here how do you collapse
comments on old reddit
click the line to the left to erase you
click on this thing
yo i came here prepared to vote you're
the [ __ ] but after reading i would
say not the [ __ ]
the initial agreement was she can use
your walls for practice and afterwards
use the photos that hasn't changed and
you keep deci
by you deciding to keep the paintings on
the wall oh yes fair enough hey this is
i would think about giving her a tip for
a job well done but that would be
totally voluntary and not part of the
initial agreement
i agree with that i think the op has
done nothing wrong except violating
perhaps an unspoken uh social norm of
you did a nice thing for me and i'm
gonna keep it so you know here's a
little bit of money
similarly the artist should probably not
um
threaten to sue but maybe this is why
contracts exist in the first place
[Laughter]
it's all unspoken rules that are causing
all these problems but



in session we're back on our slash
am i the [ __ ] filtered can i say by
the way thank you people
i i get links probably like a reddit
thread a day now on twitter and
i'm assuming that it's only gonna uh
grow from there
um but i just weekly this is kind of
like a
an unintended consequence i am getting
the absolute worst reddit threads of all
time
linked to me every single day on twitter
which i'm i'm here for it gives me the
people send me like uh like today i got
a reddit link that was just like am i
the
[ __ ] for telling my surrogate to stop
pretending to be my
child's mother and you're like oh my god
that's uh
i mean it's just it gives you some some
entertaining morning reading let's put
it that way
um but we're back with uh am i the
[ __ ] filtered
and i gotta tell you i'm just i'm doing
a quick perusal
and i see that we have an awful lot of
uh [ __ ] here not my words those are
the words of the
uh these are the words of the
the people of the plebiscite that have
has taken place
am i the [ __ ] for kicking my
mother-in-law out of family dinner after
she said my lasagna tastes like freezer
lasagna
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to turn
off kanye west after my girlfriend's
friend requested i do
excited okay how about this
am i the [ __ ] for telling my daughter
that if she won't stand up for herself
i don't want to hear about it your
daughter okay
um well look i'm going to tell you
sometimes you just gloss over some of
this stuff in the headline and you think
to yourself like oh well let's
hear it out look i'm i'm only the father
to a 10 month old daughter she doesn't
get into these kind of problems
right off the bat um at least i hope not
but simultaneously
it's a good start am i the [ __ ] for
telling my daughter if she won't stand
up for herself
i don't want to hear about it i divorced
my wife almost 20 years ago because her
work
work life became so severely toxic to my
mental health i was developing extreme
anger management issues
what a [ __ ] how
just immediately i divorced my wife 20
years ago
it i developed anger management issues
but it wasn't my fault
at all i had no agency her work life
became so toxic
it just made me so mad
to keep it short it didn't matter who it
was she would not stand up for herself
at work so day after day she's telling
me these work stories about how upset
she was i'd give her suggestions and
nothing would change
things escalated and slowly but surely
i'm building a resentment i didn't know
was there and found myself angry anytime
she would talk about work
she refused to get therapy or do
anything to improve her situation our
marriage slowly fell apart because of it
it wasn't until i decided to get therapy
myself because i couldn't control my
anger that i realized the relationship
itself had become toxic for me it took a
lot longer after that but we ultimately
divorced as a result
okay i have to say right off the bat
phase one paragraph one
at least he's acknowledging that he has
some issues
but the fact that he you know despite
the fact that he had been married he
didn't pick up on like one of the number
one
keys for uh maintaining a human
relationship which is sometimes people
just want to vent
and they don't want to um have their
vents where they get their stress out
be met with like well why didn't you
just take one simple solution
uh and do it you know sometimes you just
got because it
may be the reason and i'm getting too
into this early but maybe the reason she
didn't want to stand up for herself at
work is because
i as much as this sounds uh you know
maybe like a little passive
some things that make you annoyed at
work aren't worth getting into
like a confrontation over uh especially
as it might affect your your
future employment status like sometimes
your
[ __ ] rolls downhill in a in an
environment like that and you just gotta
be like i'm annoyed as hell
but i'm just gonna go home and vent to
my spouse because that's like one of the
roles they have when you talk about the
you know when you exchange vows for
richer or poorer
do you vow to listen even though
sometimes a solution will pop into your
head that seems like it could fix the
entire issue
do you pledge to recognize that they
probably thought about that
solution and then thought about you know
here's the reasons i don't want to do it
so help me god amen i don't think you
say amen in the vows i don't remember
anyway
fast forward to present day and my adult
daughter is now working in the federal
government and she's letting the same
thing happen to her
we talk on the phone every other day and
the past three phone calls she's
complained about the same situation
i've given her well the only thing i
could say at this you think at any point
in this
guy's uh treatise he's like maybe it's
genetic
there's the the the complaining gene it
couldn't be that like literally
everybody complains about their job it
it has to be
um it's just a habit that's been passed
down
we talk on the phone every other day
i've given her suggestions and nothing
has changed i immediately recognized my
anger building so i stopped her last
night and told her if she can't stand up
for herself i don't want to hear about
it
she called me an [ __ ] and hung up on
me this morning my son called
to ask why my sister's telling everyone
an [ __ ] to hear my side
so i told him the abridged version and
he told me i'm an [ __ ] as well
well can i say something here again
we're assuming these posts are real if
your daughter
and son both tell you you're the [ __ ]
you don't have to go to reddit because
even if reddit tells you you're not the
[ __ ]
what are you going to do are you you're
going to like link them
in your it's going to be all caps
forward re
forward forward you won't believe this
you know whatever whatever your kids
think
is unfortunately your reality anyway
i may have been a little tactless in how
i shut down the conversation but i can't
invite that anger into my life again i
look men i'm glad we're talking
about anger
our emotions he got therapy you know so
on and so forth
but aren't you you got an adult
daughter who's working for the federal
government that means you got to be like
in your mid
40s or older like
can't you just deal with it i know how
this sounds but like
can you can you just you know push that
down and have like one too many
yinglings on the weekend like a normal
person like i just don't understand
they're your kids this is what they're
there for this is i mean they're not
just to complain but at the same time i
think you got to take some
responsibility for your
for your awareness here or for your for
your own well-being i guess you are but
not in a healthy way oh here we go i
love when an edit comes in and the
person has clearly missed the reason
that people think that they're an
[ __ ] and they're they're being a
little bit judgmental
and instead they're like hey maybe i
wasn't specific enough about this
ancillary detail that i talked about in
the first paragraph
here's some instances of me standing up
with my wife she'd be in a team of five
but because she was very efficient her
team lead super manager would keep
putting more work on her
even when she had more work that she
could do she would never say no at one
time she was on seven projects and
everybody else and her team was on one
she just wouldn't say i can't i'm
swamped y'all fanta pull
thanks for the gifties thank you i can't
i'm swamped i would literally suggest
you say something like i'm already on
seven projects i don't have time i know
x is only on one project right now have
you asked them
that's a great way to get ahead in the
corporate uh politics game
[Laughter]
hey thanks for giving me more work but
uh jessica's not very busy right now
maybe jessica could do it
that's a good way to get uninvited to
the potluck um
she would complain and stress out and
have breakdowns before the week started
because of work anxiety but she still
wouldn't say no
after years of seeing this happen to my
wife but her never doing anything to
change in order to try to improve
herself so she'd have the confidence
the anger i was feeling at her workplace
was carrying over to her i couldn't
stomach hearing about her work anymore
without immediately becoming angry but i
kept bottling it up until i couldn't
anymore now my daughter is letting the
same thing happen to her
so i just keep hearing about just
hearing about it is immediately putting
me back in that place again
and the anger i used to feel is coming
up with my daughter this
is uh i'm a little surprised to see that
i mean
this is the oh literally i can't even
scroll further anyway i'll just tell you
it's uh you're the [ __ ] 43
not the [ __ ] 39
which is a little surprising uh for me
but i do know that's the reddit
demographic as well
um i think there there might be a lot of
let's say
younger people who are like well if she
didn't want a solution to the problem
she shouldn't have been
knocking about it in the first place you
know um
and by the way i so often hear this as
like uh
uh like oh women don't want a solution
to their problem they just want to
complain
whereas men are like hardwired to be uh
like solutions providers and i'm like i
think i bought into that like kool-aid
when i was in the
when i was in my early 20s but now i'm
like dude i just love to complain all
the time
sometimes i'll just go into the discord
and i'll complain
about like a stranger i saw i'll be like
you won't believe this [ __ ] that i
heard
that i saw at the grocery store
yesterday people don't go like oh you
know
they should go up and tell them to
modify their behavior do they just drop
middle finger emojis and say give them
one of those next time and i'm like hell
yeah
[Laughter]
complaining's just it's it's it's part
of the the human
nature you know anyway i would say
before we look at the update
absolutely um absolutely the [ __ ]
look i think you got to separate the
concerns here right
is it okay to not love
hearing someone complain about something
that seems easily fixable
yeah and if it was like someone that's a
little bit further outside of like your
sphere
of influence then you know you'd be like
hey
i you know if you're just gonna
constantly complain about this stuff you
ever thought about adjusting your
behavior then
you know you could say that maybe to a
friend or to a uh
an acquaintance and get away with it um
but to a spouse
that's really like that's part of the
foundational duties i think which is
like
i mean again i made a joke about how
it's part of the vows but like
much of the communication that happens
between spouses is probably just like
bitching about stuff that happened at
work that day
you get it out i get it out and then
it's okay what do you want for dinner
two hours later we decided we eat then
we go to bed like that's that's
basically what it's all about so if
you're
if you're not up for that
that doesn't make them the [ __ ] it it
it does mean that you you know maybe you
did the right thing by getting divorced
but i think he's also realizing that
uh you know literally everybody does
this like i don't believe it's uh
this is like a just a mother and
daughter situation i think
pretty much everybody that he talks to
in his life must [ __ ] about work now
and then but simultaneously everybody
else he can just like walk away from
so yeah i think i i think it does make
him the [ __ ] i mean
i hate to be like you know that as the
husband or father your role is just to
lay down and go like uh-huh uh-huh yeah
okay
wow she sucks wow that's crazy but like
yeah pretty much you kind of gotta and
you recognize that
they do it for you as well or maybe like
if they don't do it for you
you should start venting a little bit
more usu when you have a bad day at work
instead of just shoving it down inside
you should start going off
anyway that's so i i think yeah
kind of the [ __ ] let's look at this
link to update
oh lord every time
[Laughter]
i wanted to lead by clearing up a few
things
my wife and i were married for seven
years before my anger issues manifested
i was her emotional support for even
longer she introduced me to some
solutions and support we had our own
rules on our daily walks i just listened
if she spoke about work at home and
meant we could discuss it normal
just a very normal uh
sort of arrangement to have with your
spouse
uh excuse on our walks you can complain
that's the safe spot for complaining
when we're within the confines of the
home any complaining is met with a
solutions based response
i did tell her she needs to get help but
that was at the end of our relationship
she refused couples therapy personal
therapy and insisted it was my
responsibility to be there for her okay
well
let me just say that does make her kind
of the [ __ ] if we take this is true
you know the you you refusing to uh be
involved
or her refusing to be involved in
therapy makes her kind of the [ __ ]
sure okay simultaneous i i do
also need to say like so much of the the
post
is like about the relationship with the
ex-wife
and the original post is am i the
[ __ ] for telling my daughter to shut
up
basically so like the whole relationship
with your ex-wife is just
background context like like let's get
to the part where you're like
oh and my daughter you know i was hungry
in the conversation anyway
um ultimately i had to walk away from
the marriage
my daughter is nearing 30 years old she
is not a child
and i'm happy to say we have a great
relationship her regular call should be
proof of that
she did call me an [ __ ] though for
those wondering why my anger is
hard to control here's here's why it's
different for me than other people
prior i never really got angry i was
raised with a belief that if something
happens it's happened you got no control
over it so don't let it bother you
i never had much of an experience with
anger because of this when i started to
feel it i just bottled everything i
ignorantly believed that i had control
update i had a zoom call with my
children
i started by apologizing to my daughter
okay acceptable
i've never spoken to either of them
about why their mother and i divorced so
i explained it to them
uh as minimally as i could i confessed
my mental health struggles with anger i
made it clear it wasn't her fault now
they have the whole picture
again it's just like i
react's cord wouldn't exist if this were
the case but yeah this is like
i mean it's just it just scares me that
like a
a father to a 30 year old
uh woman
is like before i thought to apologize
i just ran it by reddit first to make
sure i wasn't gonna
you know beta myself or something like
that but anyway
the conversation went well i answered
their questions as best as i could i
reassured my daughter she can always
speak to me and she can
vent to me little sauce but that's okay
she asked if it would help if she let me
know ahead of time that she wants to
vent about work and it was embarrassing
but i asked if she could we agreed that
she'll text me bad work day and if i'm
able to i'll call her
my son didn't have much to say but he
did tell his sister she can call him to
vent too
okay that you know if it works it works
um but again
i don't know maybe i'm idealizing this
situation where i'm like i think if
you're the dad you kind of gotta
you know sorry i mean i look it's
good probable mental health like
quarantining
but i do when i look to myself as being
like a you know if i'm
uh like 60 and and my daughter's in her
30s or getting to be in her 30s
and she texts me like bad work day and
i'm like sorry i'm not in the right
headspace to help you out right now
i'm like you know i kind of feel like
that it's
if you got to do it for self-care you
got to do it for self-care
but at the same time i'm like you know
this is kind of your role as the father
i guess but anyway um
whatever if it works for them it works
for them you know different stuff for
different people
um what you got to do you got to find
your daughter a spouse i think that's
that's my
[ __ ] solution to this um which is
that
i think you need to this is like an
unethical life pro tip
you need to find your daughter a spouse
that can receive the venting instead of
you
because it sounds like he wants to live
in a world where nobody else
ever talks about their problems so i
think at this point you gotta
start being the matchmaker for your
daughter you gotta be like
you know hey i've gotta have lined up a
series of great listeners
pick one
[Laughter]
but then what if she has to vent about
her husband no that's i think that's a
sibling thing i think that's then she
texts the brother and says bad
marriage day anyway um not much else to
say thank you to everyone for your
kindness and time for everyone who is
hostile with me i hope you find your own
peace i love that man
look he was he seems like he came to
the end of being a nice guy but i love
that he he was kind of like an
[ __ ] in the first post but then in
the at the end of the second one he's
like
i hope you find a way to get rid of your
anger someday
anyway still that's a good ending you
know
again it might not be the way that i
would ideally solve this problem but uh
if they were able to to come to a
solution like as a result of their
as a result of that then then who am i
to judge right who am i to say that
that's not okay
just giving my two cents and trying to
make it entertaining as well it seems
like a little bit of a happy ending
verdict op original post
kind of the [ __ ] update
recognize that the best way to solve
this stuff is probably to just have a
conversation with the person
who got offended rather than read it and
then you know there you go
am i the [ __ ] for telling my sister
she's a failure as a parent
oh no because her son is in a
relationship
with a cartoon character pillow
just take a little sip real quick am i
the [ __ ] for telling my sister
she's a failure as a parent because her
son is in a relationship with a cartoon
character pillow
chad's asking the right question what
what character is it
good day y'all
my 18 year old nephew is in a
relationship with a body-sized pillow
with some sort of japanese girl cartoon
character on it
yes a relationship like that's his
girlfriend with a
freaking cartoon character he proudly
walks around with the pillow and talks
to it
i asked my sister what the frick is
going on and she called me a bigot for
not supporting this
i told her she failed as a mother and
that he needs to be straightened out if
he's mentally ill
he needs to seek professional help
otherwise someone needs to set him
straight because this is pathetic
um this it might be fake yeah or like
definitely is fake but again we always
assume that it's real
i i do love the the second paragraph
there's two options
he either needs therapy from an
accredited mental health professional
if he won't do that someone's gotta set
him straight
someone someone's gotta sit him down you
know what they gotta do they gotta make
him
be in a relationship with like an entire
crate like a shipping container
full of body pillows like when your dad
catches you smoking a cigarette when
you're 12 and he makes you smoke a whole
pack on the porch with him
you you got to be in a relationship with
every single body pillow until you get
it out of your system
anyway the whole family's against me i
don't hate this kid he needs help but i
can't understand why i'm the oddly one
who thinks
there is a problem here um
there's not a lot to go on here but i
will say you're the [ __ ] 48
not the [ __ ] 35 that's what we got
everybody sucks here 14
i'm the oddly one
again i i think it's important and i'm
not sure if everybody does this
you know when they look at these posts
but for me i think it's important to
like
separate perhaps the way that you feel
about an issue
like you know your nephew being in a
relationship with a body pillow
versus the actual response that was had
you know what i mean so i think some
people would read this and be like
you know if your nephew's in a
relationship with a pillow and genuinely
thinks the pillow's his girlfriend
that's pretty cringe and as a result you
cannot be an [ __ ] regardless of the
actions you took
whereas i'm like look i'm
if if my niece or my nephew brought a
body pillow
out and was like this is my girlfriend
i would have to think long and hard
about how many anecdotes i was going to
reveal to the public on that one
because it would be a once
in a lifetime story like that's like a
career-making
story to introduce into the lore but
simultaneously
maybe a little bit over the line to
sacrifice your nephew for content
i probably wouldn't okay but i in the
back channel i would be like
you know hey is everything okay that
being said
um that doesn't mean you can like
could you talk to the nephew maybe or
even have like a sit-down conversation
with your sister
you know you can't just go hey you've
failed as a mother um as a result of
this
like that's like why is it always like
it goes nuclear
immediately it's never like an
escalation
it's always like i don't like the mashed
potatoes well how about you [ __ ]
die like it always goes
straight to infinity like either they're
missing context or
or like these people are already like on
the razor's edge
of of being livid at all times
um regardless yeah yeah i mean you're
the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] for telling your
sister you're a failure as a parent
because your son is in her
because her son is in a relationship
with a cartoon character pillow do not
take that to mean that i'm saying
get out there to bed bath and beyond and
and start playing the you know there's
plenty of fish in the sea
in the upholstery section rather it's
more like
you don't get to have cool uh you know
good boy credits
for being like hey that situation's like
a little bit [ __ ] up
i'm not gonna do anything to solve it
but have you ever noticed like
you you haven't actually done anything
you're like leonard nimoy in the
monorail episode of the simpsons like
yeah you've recognized it's unusual and
you're like hey
fix it and then they're like i don't
think that anything's wrong and you're
like well
you failed as a mother anyway yeah plus
you never
you never told us uh which character and
that's important
as you have never told us which
character how am i supposed to judge
here
i don't know any characters from anime
um
um major kusanagi was it major kusanagi
was it hank hill
all right take me back oh now we finally
got to a good one here okay
not that the other ones didn't have a
little bit of meat but
oh man am i the [ __ ] for
refusing to turn off kanye west after my
girlfriend's friend requested that i do
this is sort of a petty squabble
[Laughter]
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to turn
off kanye west after my girlfriend's
friend requested that i do
i this is sort of a petty squabble i had
but my girlfriend told me after i was
being unreasonable and i can see why
she said so but i still made the post
nonetheless for entertainment i
appreciate it for the content easy clap
upstairs champion for posting this for
content yesterday my girlfriend her
friend and i were all going somewhere so
i picked her and her friend up while in
the car i began to play some kanye west
and rapping along with the lyrics
after a couple minutes my girlfriend's
friend requested i turned them
by the way can i say um
a little cringe this is just my two
cents
to like if you're in the car by yourself
do whatever you want
if you're in the call with like uh you
know
your your partner close friend whatever
you could do whatever you want i mean
you could literally do whatever you want
at any time i guess but
um this crosses the social norm
for sure uh regardless after a couple of
minutes my girlfriend's friend requested
i turn the music off because she finds
kanye misogynistic and annoying
i refuse because it's my car and i'm
entitled to play what i want so i
continued to play him
after we dropped her off my girlfriend
told me i was being unreasonable and
should have just turned them off to
avoid any arguments
i can see her pov but at the same time
it's my car
and i can do what i want again and then
the edit of course the
the edit is always like i was playing
the album 808
and heartbreak paranoid robocop
heartless street lights for those of you
who aren't familiar with kanye's
discography it has no curse words and is
an album
about his breakup it's like it
does it does it change your opinion that
i ignored her request
if you know it's 808s and heartbreaks
does that does that give you the kind of
context that makes me come across
in a better light okay we got 58
you're the [ __ ] 35 not the [ __ ]
i mean here's the thing there are
unspoken rules in a car
you know like let's talk about it if
someone calls shotgun you respect it
there is a rule that overrides shotgun
if
the uh boyfriend or girlfriend of the
driver
is around the rules of shotgun do not
apply any longer
the the romantic partner always gets
uh the front seat next to the driver the
driver
gets the right of first refusal on the
music
now there there's probably some city you
know if you got a little kid in the car
maybe you don't want to be listening to
like hardcore gangster rap or something
like that
but the driver gets to choose the music
or
the right to pass the music on to
another person
hey can you pick the songs the person
in the passenger seat is always in
charge
of the navigation so like it used to be
they'd have to plan a route out or get a
map or something like that or pay
attention to what the exit was going to
be
now it's hey you program the gps or like
look it up in google map on your phone
and then basically like everybody else
is just don't
the the the driver is in control if the
driver says you can't eat then you can't
eat in the car okay
within reason they don't want crumbs in
their car they don't want filet-o-fish
sandwich wrappers all over the floor
then so be it
if they say you know go to town i even
put some like potato chips in the back
then you go for it you know it's
it's simple everyone else is there yeah
do you keep the driver awake entertain
don't distract etc say yeah don't don't
get into fist fights
don't start throwing stuff everybody
there's one other unspoken rule which is
when the gps talks
everybody is silent until the driver
says
you can talk again and that's it i think
that's pretty that's that's it
not oh when when you've been driving for
like an hour and there's like three
exits on the highway coming up close
and then you're like in 600
meters take exit and then people are
like
and you're like shut up i gotta know
is it is it exit 118a or 118b right
okay so anyway now that we've gone
through that let me uh let me hydrate
um definitely there's 808s there's no
swearing in 808s
why why are you in the op of the opinion
that you can't be offensive without
swear words
some of the most offensive [ __ ] i've
ever seen has been
like g-rated
maybe dan posted it dan are you the op
here
[Laughter]
i'm just saying look again you have to
separate
the issue from the behavior okay
is the issue reasonable i think when
you're in the car
you know if you don't like the music
that's being played
my two cents is that you get over it
right
you know how many times i've in high
school especially at drive with mouth he
puts on like some
some trivium or some in flames or
something like that i got no
like i i derived no value from it i have
no idea
what's being said because it's it's
growling and i haven't learned that
diction yet what do i do oh can we put
on some broken social scene or something
like that i'm like nah it's his car
i'm happy to get a drive in the 1994
volvo station wagon that
was was older than i was at that point
and it was uh
you know it was his uh generosity to
drive me home in the first place
that being said i also think
if you're the driver you got to worry
about other people's concerns you know
if if i was driving a car i consider
myself like the general manager
of like a cool nightclub on wheels and
if a customer came
up to me and was like hey the music
that's being played is uh
making it a little bit inhospitable in
here for me i would be like you know
what thank you so much for your comment
let's put on you know the carpenters or
something like that
seems like there's a compromise where
you could have found
something that was not kanye west but
that you both enjoyed
is i guess what i'm saying um
regardless i was i would say i mean this
one's weird for me i don't think that op
had to
you know bring the nuclear hammer down
and i think that you know it is their
car
my my unspoken rule is you know the
driver gets the right
of first refusal on the music um
that being said i do have to say
it kind of is his car his rules i don't
know if you thought i was going to end
up on this side of this but
i i don't know if this is even and
everybody sucks here i almost feel like
this is uh
like he's the [ __ ] but also he's
right
[Laughter]
i i think he's dumb maybe because he
probably
if he had just changed the music he
might have saved himself an argument and
all it takes is a couple of electrical
impulses but
um i also feel like it probably
uh lowered your standing in the eyes of
your girlfriend's friend which is kind
of like uh
you know maybe you care maybe you don't
but it's not gonna make your life any
easier let's put it that way
uh i i would have just changed the music
but i could understand why he wouldn't
have
this is an interest there's a there's
actually a lot of meat for discussion on
this
plus i hope that we at least people jeed
some rules about being in the car
i mean there's only a couple of like
rules in the car that are like
sacrosanct right is that is that how
that word works
if they keep their car very clean and
you open up like a bag of potato chips
or something like that like that's where
you
start to run into some issues i think
that's where you're like
you don't compromise that one at all
because i don't want to have to go get
the
dyson down here and you know vacuum the
bugatti all-weather floor mats out just
because you ate some hickory sticks like
just pull over and eat them in the woods
like god intended
anyway
i don't even mind eating in the car the
here's and again there's
it's a complicated web of rules right
but like
if you're gonna eat in the car my rule
is you have to give me some
i don't care if you're starving if
you're eating in the back seat
you you better like i mean if you got a
10 piece i'd expect one nook
or at least like a little like grab of
fries you know what i mean like a little
duck
a little duck grab of french fries
if you got a six piece i'm not gonna
take a whole nugget that's a little
crazy but
you know i might be like hey if we go
through the drive-through like can you
give me a drink or something like that
anyway
[Laughter]
it's very complicated this is why i i
think it's why i'm so hungry all the
time my brain's constantly running
simulations on
on the proper way to behave you know
with social norms and etiquette
and context and you know this exact
situation having extra concessions
am i the [ __ ] for leaving a diner a
one-star oh a
i thought it was a human being and i was
like oh my god somebody
actually made my website a reality
where the restaurant owners can rate the
customers i was so happy
uh but then when i read more okay it's a
it's a diner like a restaurant
all right
am i the [ __ ] for leaving a diner a
one-star review by the way i'm sure then
i don't know i i might have missed the
raid thank you
perfect timing for the kanye west op
as well am i the [ __ ] for leaving a
diner a one-star review for refusing to
accommodate me and remake my food
yesterday i took my son out to eat for
lunch we decided to try a cute
family-owned diner that had pretty good
reviews
i have some severe potentially
life-threatening food allergies all
right let's
just not the [ __ ] and the only reason
i i think actually you know what they
might be an [ __ ]
just for making the post
when you know immediately you're not
gonna come across as the [ __ ]
if it was like i don't like peanuts then
that's like okay maybe
you were a bad customer if you're like
if i eat them i die
um then yeah okay like you already have
the moral high ground let's let's see
where it goes
i have some severe potentially
life-threatening food allergies so i
usually try to play a safe
and order something i know does not have
anything that could kill me in it
i ordered a toasted gluten-free grilled
chicken breast wrap
with lettuce onions and green peppers
those were the listed ingredients and
that seems safe
it's not something i would order but i
also
don't have life-threatening gluten
intolerance okay
i'm not judging you based on your
restaurant order that's something we
saved for the banter in other contexts
on a roll yes sir yo let me get a
toasted gluten-free chicken breast wrap
with lettuce onions green peppers on a
roll yes sir
can't forget the bev you know i gotta
cop that tap water
that lukewarm tap water yes sir
when i got my food i noticed something
red in it and picked it out with my fork
it was a tomato which i am highly
allergic to
there was tomatoes all through my food
so i was unable to eat it
okay i quietly motioned
for someone to come over and explain the
situation and they called for the owner
to listen to me
the owner said they'd remake my food but
they'd have to charge me again for the
time and ingredients even though i could
not eat what i was given
this is what i this is the labor crunch
in the united states right now
margins have been pushed so thin they
can't even remake a
toasted gluten-free grilled chicken
breast wrap with
chicken breast wrap with lettuce onions
and green peppers on a roll yes sir
hard not the [ __ ] though i will say
if we're taking them at face value
and their menu literally said it just
has lettuce onions green peppers and
then it comes out with a tomato
if someone's allergic to tomato
you should remake it for free
if it said tomato on the menu
they missed it and said oh sorry i
missed it
i still think you should
make it for free but also that they
should
offer to pay for it and then you know
i don't you know it's just whether you
want to be a
the the a benevolent restaurant owner
whether you want to like nickel and dime
somebody
i understand either way anyway i pointed
out that nowhere were tomatoes listed in
any part of the dish
i ordered and if they were in a wrap
they should be listed especially if
someone has an allergy
the owner said they don't put everything
up on the board and it's not a big deal
okay now like this is getting
complicated
i thought it was a menu okay
like a printed menu but if it's on a a
text board you know like one of those
like i don't even know how to describe
them like the plastic snap letters go on
to it
or a chalkboard i can understand why
they wouldn't be able to write out every
single ingredient that's
that's gonna be on it i would also now
i'm but
now i'm like you know what i also feel
like the restaurant owner is still kind
of the [ __ ] i don't know if this is
just a recent thing or if it's a
vancouver thing but even if i'm like at
a if i'm in
any kind of sit-down restaurant the wade
staff
always ask hey any food allergies that i
gotta know about
it's like one of the first things that
comes up all the time
you you order something and then they go
you know hey any food allergies
and then you leave that up to the the
diner to pass it on but i don't know
you've never been asked that it had it
happens here
i would say at like at least
70 percent of of meals where i've sat
down
absolutely never heard it in the us
that's crazy man
i mean it makes i i will say it didn't
happen uh
you know like until i moved here so i
don't know if it's a regional thing
or if it's only started happening you
know within the past decade or so i
probably was not asked for the first
time until i was like you know 20 but
anyway um and when
when you get asked it you're like i'm
surprised i i'm let me rephrase i'm not
surprised
i'm surprised it is a more common place
to be asked because
you know i'm sure the odds of it are
pretty low but
you don't want to feed somebody like
chicken satay with a peanut sauce and
then they eat it and die
and they're like were there peanuts in
that
like people are very dumb
i think like it might be the
responsibility of the diner don't get me
wrong to make sure they don't eat
something that's life-threatening but
simultaneously i'm like you know
it's uh people do things that are in
their you know
self not their self interest all the
time anyway um owners said they don't
put everything up on the board it's not
a big deal and for me to either pay to
have my food remade or i can choose not
to eat but i will not be receiving a
second meal for free
owner kind of the [ __ ] i ended up
reordering my meal to my specifications
it took 30 minutes to come out when
before it was less than 10 and was
obviously burned i ate what i could and
threw the rest away before leaving
i think this is a situation where you
got to establish um
that's you know for your son
you need to not eat at that restaurant
if that makes sense
sometimes as a dad i think and i i'm i
have the luxury of not having been put
in this position yet um but sometimes as
a dad i think you need to go hungry in
order to teach your child a lesson
in like not in a negative way but to be
like i would rather
be hungry than give that business that i
hate any more money
that's my take on that subject the fact
that he maybe he was starving and he
ordered again
but i think sometimes you gotta you
gotta do a hunger strike like chris
cornell and be like nah
actually i'm [ __ ] full actually i'm
stuffed i would not like another
you know what you could do is you could
just bring me the bill please
and then that's where then they go oh
and then everyone claps and they give
you a crisp 100
bill or something um and when you get
home yeah you could just steal bread
from the mouths of decadence
um anyway i was really disappointed in
the whole experience ended up
writing a one star review blasting the
place for how i felt they treated me am
i the [ __ ]
again the the context has absolutely no
merit whatsoever
this is a type of wrap i had ordered in
many places before and it does not
typically come with tomatoes it would be
the equivalent of getting a philly
cheesesteak with tomatoes basically
ah yes any time i go to a restaurant i
always scan the menu for my favorite
wrap a gluten-free toasted grilled
chicken breast wrap with lettuce onions
and green peppers
lettuce onions green peppers it's called
the gluten-free toasted chicken breast
log wrap
class it's usually near the top because
every place has it
um and it never has tomatoes a wrap with
tomatoes in it are you stupid
anyway op is not the [ __ ] obviously
but literally like this whole post is
like i was treated like [ __ ] at a
restaurant
uh so i gave them a bad review
on a food review website which is the
purpose of the food review website am i
an [ __ ]
no like literally not at all um
seeking some attention and validation
for the story or maybe there's an upvote
farm
you never know um
if this story is real i feel like the
restaurant owner
kind of an [ __ ] you know what you
know it's been
uh nice sometimes you you go like
pick up takeout from a restaurant they
have this like qr code
menu outside this is i'm i'm all about
this now
you you scan the qr code with your phone
it gives you a menu on your phone so you
don't have to worry about this limited
chalkboard space
and stuff like that you can even like
you you can scan order whatever you want
you can pay you don't even have to like
deal with a human being
all it does is like point to a website
anyway
i'm a big fan of that regardless um
i mean this i've inserted my own
anecdote now
also makes the menu translatable there
you go the diner is the [ __ ] for not
doing the qr code menu
this is a big one for human beings you
know how long for for like a decade
i was talking about how the worst part
of eating at a restaurant
is waiting for the when you're done your
food the server comes over
and then they go you want anything else
and then you go i'll just take the bill
please then you gotta wait for them to
bring the bill
and then sometimes you look at the bill
but they've already left
and then they come back like in five
minutes and you're like i
oh sorry i need the machine and then
they go get the machine like it
sometimes takes like 10 or 15 minutes to
leave the restaurant when you're done
your food
now you just on your phone you just scan
the qr code
you go pay and then you're
you're good you can just walk out and
you feel like a damn gangster the whole
time but
anyway slash marker i was talking about
it for years
i'm not gonna say that the pandemic
accomplished anything good but
the expediting of the restaurant process
if it becomes normalized
i i will at least be a fan of that
okay slash marker react court
one in the books



okay
we got a little bit more going here
still many more things am i the [ __ ]
for kicking my mother-in-law
out of family dinner after she said my
lasagna tasted like freezer lasagna
yes absolutely um don't even need to
read it
any any time you uh kick
your spouse's mom out of family dinner
uh you're you're
really you're on an uphill battle to
have the moral high ground
like they could they could pull down
their pants take a crap on the carpet
they could you know insult your kid or
something like that
but even just insulting the food it's
it's tough to tell them to get out i
guess
anyway let's it's early it's early let's
let's see
i just i see so many words right off the
bat giggled shrieking
mother-in-law is a fairly typical
passive aggressive mother-in-law
tell me you hate uh women without
telling me you hate women
she's a fairly typical passive
aggressive mother-in-law
you know how they are nice to my face
but the food is only ever fine she
purses her lips and my parenting
she plays favorites with her sons
okay i get it i get i'm sorry i come
from an only i'm an only child
sometimes when people start talking
about uncle mother-in-law
sons i start to have to do the family
math in my like i still don't even
really know what a cousin is
like i have to i have to think about
what a cousin is from time to time but
anyway
yeah by the way i love uh sorting
through uh
dozens of spreadsheets to find the data
i need for my presentation
said no happy project manager ever see
why
a 125 000 companies
rely on monday's five-star platform to
orchestrate their team's workflows
show me show me
never never heard of it i am also not a
project manager but
more power to you okay
my food is only ever fine but everything
as my sister-in-law cooks is heaven sent
sister-in-law married the favored son
and gives mother-in-law
unlimited access to the grandkids
this is spicy we had a big family dinner
the other night and my husband brought
up
how she is about my food he said it in
the kitchen out of earshot of
mother-in-law brother-in-law decided to
do a test and had father-in-law
her ex cover her eyes and asked her to
try something
first of all there was literally 10
minutes of back and forth about her
being convinced it was a cockroach so by
the time she got it into her mouth
it was probably cold so the
mother-in-law
she thought that her family was gonna be
like
hey close your eyes we're gonna feed you
a cockroach
i wouldn't cross my mind whatsoever but
um
anyway uh then there was some shrieking
because they were laughing so she was
convinced they did something to her
then more shrieking because she wanted
her eyes uncovered so father-in-law
finally let her go and said it was fine
she said it was fine it tasted like
frozen lasagna
brother-in-law shrugged and said sorry i
guess she doesn't like your cooking
mother-in-law asked if i cooked it
giggled and said they shouldn't have put
her on the spot
everyone was laughing and i was just
over it i said that was what i cooked
for dinner if she didn't like it she
could leave
mother-in-law said it was fine and her
new husband tried to make a joke that it
was better than cockroaches
but that did not go over well
oh that's that's me at the family
gathering when things get awkward too
i'll be like hey at least it's better
than cockroaches and everyone
shoots you a look like shut the [ __ ] up
this goes deep man
this is resentment that started building
before you were even a
a twinkle in this family we didn't even
know who the hell you were when the
roots for this one started to take hold
i said she should leave and she acted
all confused mother-in-law left with her
husband
and brother-in-law and sister-in-law
went after them father-in-law defended
her and said i was being too sensitive
but my husband took my side
finally it doesn't happen that often
53 minutes of uh react court
we have the first sane husband
[Laughter]
who i have to imagine in his head was
probably like this is all very silly but
i know my role
um she said
he said she can't come back until she
apologized
now sister-in-law and brother-in-law are
saying i set her up i'm a cry baby and i
just wanted a reason to kick her out
it's just like so many steps
uh to be to get mad you know like it's
such an elaborate kind of rube goldberg
machine
to make yourself upset i i
almost don't even understand okay so
your mother-in-law you have a
conspiracy theory that
she dislikes your food because you
married not
the favored son whereas the eldest
son his wife always gets all the credit
for cooking
let's talk it that could be real can i
also say though that it's possible that
her sister-in-law is just either a
better cook
or alternatively cooks food that's more
to the liking of a
you know middle-aged american woman
which could happen sure you know i'm
assuming it's american
because it's insane
okay so you have a scientific hypothesis
um you set up a test so far this is
relatively okay scientific uh method
right
um you say let's feed her this lasagna
because my base case is that i know that
this [ __ ]
fire and we're gonna cover her eyes and
then when she eats it she'll give her
honest opinion
if she says it's good which 100
is what's gonna happen that's where she
deviated from the scientific method your
null hypothesis is supposed to be uh
deniability i think most of the time but
anyway
um if she says it's good then i'll be
like
um gotcha and then
all this will be water under the bridge
surely there will be no other
implications
if she says it sucks then i'll get mad
and kick her out of my house
says it sucks you got mad and kicked her
out of the house i'm like
i mean i definitely think that op
is uh is kind of an [ __ ] in this
situation
i can also understand you know why
uh she would be upset don't get me wrong
um maybe this is like a
maybe this is an entitled thing to say
or maybe this is just ego driven
when i i trust my own palate to some
extent you know i know what i like
when i eat something that i cooked and
it's delicious
i'm like it's delicious if somebody was
like yeah it's okay
i'd be like oh sorry my bad but in my
head i'd be like your pal it [ __ ]
blows lady
this [ __ ] is [ __ ] is fire
are you kidding me this is delicious i
get though that you know you're in a big
family situation there's some
jockeying for position you know it's
uh you you watch too much succession
you're trying to figure out where you
are in the family dynamic are you more
of like a cousin ed or are you the
heir apparent so like i i get that part
of it but i'm just like
it seems like a lot of overreacting for
something that's so small
if it does sound sorry cousin greg not
cousin ed my mistake
i've only seen a few episodes um
i will also say it is uh 41
you're the [ __ ] 34 not the [ __ ]
i am trying to put myself in in the
mindset
of somebody that would say that op is
not the [ __ ] here
i i think there's like a if i'm being
legitimate i think there's like a 25
uh floor for not the [ __ ]
because op always writes the post
right like
when op writes the post they always make
it seem like
here's this issue that's so important to
me
and then my mother-in-law who's like a
typical mother-in-law she's fairly
passive-aggressive
kind of a [ __ ] you know fairly typical
um
it i'm just saying i'm i'm i don't know
why it takes so much issue with that
it's like it it's just such an
unnecessary detail that says so much
about the character
of the of the poster i think they could
have just been like
you know they could have just cut the
sentence
out and not put that evil on all
mother-in-laws
they could have like a mother-in-law is
not even like a
a role you know it's like all
women who have kids who have been
married that's like it's probably like
15
of the population it's such a huge
generalization
it might even be more than that but i
i'm just doing some back of the napkin
anyway
i'm also i'm kinda and i'm not trying to
make you mad chat but
i am kind of losing my mind
at the number of people in chat who are
like what they should have done is taken
the sister-in-law's food
and then blindfolded the mother-in-law
and see if she said she like they told
teller that it's the mother the the
opie's food but it's actually the
sister-in-law
like sure you can probably design the
experiment to be double-blind
scientifically valid repeatable you know
etc etc
maybe you could get a hundred thousand
mother-in-laws that
are you know across multiple
demographics and classes and so on and
so forth
income levels and then you know the
various self-reported degrees of lasagna
enjoyment
um i think it's more like this situation
shouldn't have come to pass in the first
place but
dude you actually i'm i'm stealing from
chad now
but they gave me a a great idea what
about a reality show
oh this [ __ ] was slap man what about a
reality show
it's a cooking competition
two like the mother-in-law from two
families
cook their best dish together like to
compete against one another
and then like gordon ramsay judges who
the best chef of the mother-in-law's is
oh man now that would be a show
you could you could see the fireworks
flying
oh and here for the 400th time uh this
season
we have hot dish this is greta's hot
dish
anyway i'm not trying to insult uh
mother-in-law's just uh
i feel like hot dishes is a common one
my grandma makes something called
pineapple dessert anybody else
ever have pineapple dessert it's it's
literally just
uh canned pineapples and cool whip i
think anytime i go to
uh thanksgiving everyone's like oh you
gotta have some pineapple dessert
i've never had it but uh people they
they
go off on it man they're like you gotta
try it
anyway uh how do i this takes me back
right new reddit that takes me okay
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to bake
without
nuts
i have a feeling i know where this is
going okay so i'm a home baker i really
enjoy baking as an activity i often
make cakes and cookies and share them
with my loved ones because i want to
plus i
just eat them all if i didn't do that i
usually have a lot of nut based recipes
and i really like using nuts
as a topping to make my cakes look good
i recently baked a cake for a friend's
kid who was having a birthday party she
absolutely loved it
so another friend of mine asked me to
bake a cake for her kid i'm not really
close with this friend of mine but her
kid went to the other one's party and
really liked the cake
so she asked me to bake one for her but
without nuts because a few of the kids
coming to the party had
nut allergies i said it wouldn't be the
same cake that her daughter liked
because mine contained walnuts and
almonds which gave the cake its flavor
so far everything's okay all right
it sounds like the baker
made a delicious cake the prospective
customer said hey can you make it
without nuts
and then the baker said no i can't
because it's not
it's not the cake it doesn't sound like
she was like on principle i just will
not cook something without nuts
sounds like she's like it's got an alm
is made with almond flour or something
okay
anyway she asked if i could make a cake
with nut alternatives to achieve a
similar taste
this is now where op
has the moral high ground and this i i
like doing it
you know we're debugging the social
interaction step through
you wanted a free cake
right and then you wanted it without
nuts
the baker says you can't have it without
nuts because it's a nut-based cake
and then the parent said is there any
way you could formulate
a different recipe you know on your own
time
to make a a similar cake like if they
said
well would you be open to making like
another cake that would be something but
like this
can could you do some chemistry research
okay i honestly don't think i can so i
said no
so she told me to just bake a chocolate
cake instead i am going to say
i hope that she didn't say
okay just bake me a chocolate cake
instead i'm hoping that she was like
if you're still up for it we'd just take
a chocolate cake it's a free cake you
know
anyway i told her i'd be happy to bake
the original cake for her because her
kid really liked it and that was the
only reason i was doing it
she got pissed and said it was up to her
to decide which cake she wanted for her
daughter's birthday
i said sure but i won't bake it for you
this is you can see how quickly it came
to pass
[Laughter]
she got passed she complained i'd baked
one for the other kid according to her
specifications it was vegan so i should
do the same for her
i said i did it because the kid herself
was vegan and not some of the guests and
hung up i feel bad because the kid
really liked the cake and wanted one for
her birthday but her mother was annoying
me at this point i don't feel like i'm
the [ __ ] but i'm here so am i the
[ __ ]
pre pre-edit not the [ __ ]
you know we we talked about it like a
little bit last week
um you ever hear the expression again
that like
and and this was about the one where the
art student painted something beautiful
on the wall
thinking that it was gonna get uh
painted over
and then they were like oh i love it and
then they wanted payment and it was a
whole
is a very kind of similar thing here
where you know if someone is doing a
favor
in one direction and then the terms of
the original
favor change a little bit and it becomes
a situation where
i mean i really i hate to be this
cynical but i do sometimes believe in
the expression like no good deed goes
unpunished
you know you hey out of the goodness of
your heart my daughter loved your cake
could you possibly
make her that cake for her birthday yes
i could
i would love to could you make it
without
nuts in it no i can't could you make a
chocolate cake
this is where i think they're like i
could but they didn't even eat that the
first time so they don't even know if
they like it
i think i i think it's a choosing beggar
situation anyway
so far so far edit i wasn't being
commissioned it was a free cake i don't
have a problem baking with not
without nuts i assume this kid wanted my
cake because she liked it
i was surprised because the original
cake had no chocolate at all
so she suddenly turned around and
ordered a cake a la carte which i wasn't
really expecting
as always this is i think why like the
legal system
and like arbitration exists people who
are too
close to the story do not understand
the meat and potatoes of the conflict
i i wish that we could all be reasonable
enough to just hash things out but she's
now talking about like
cake salad cart the original cake had no
chocolate in it and then she wants a
chocolate cake there's a transfer of
chocolate from one date like this
this part is ancillary
i am happy to experiment with my baking
on my own time i don't need tips from
strangers telling me i should broaden my
horizons about baking
i bake what i like to bake it isn't a
job i do it for fun
i didn't force her to take the nut cake
i told her i was only willing to make
the nutcake because that's what her
daughter had asked for i wasn't trying
to force
a nutcake on her to kill kids for
frick's sake
i am not friends with this woman per se
she is more of an acquaintance and i've
only seen her kid maybe three or four
times i've known the other kid since she
was a toddler who said
choo choo to signal food please stop
calling me a woman
men can bake too what the hell is going
on man it's go it's
when you're when you're ahead the op was
so ahead in the argue i think there's a
great lesson here okay
when you're when you're ahead in an
argument when you've just made a good
point when you've got the majority of
people
on your side
you shut up you you did it
you people originally were like if you
read the whole thread up to this point
they would be like you know what you
agreed to make the kid a cake
they uh wanted a cake with
no nuts okay you said i can't make that
cake
my my two cents okay
my two cents is that if you agreed
to make the cake you're not legally
forced to make the cake okay but if you
agreed to make the cake
and it takes one cake's worth of labor
to do it and then they say well if you
can't make it with
nut alternatives can we just have a
chocolate cake
i think that from the ops perspective
little has changed
i would like to think that if i had
already agreed to make a cake in the
first place i would have just made a
different cake
however i wouldn't have gotten myself in
this situation
because i simply my guess is i would not
reply to the text asking me to make the
cake in the first place
i don't know i haven't had a situation
yet where like
my daughter's friend's parents were like
hey can you make a youtube video or
something but
like at some point maybe i'll just send
them a message that's like
no i am oh sorry we're really busy um
but if if op was okay
it was okay making the original cake
then i think it's not so bad
to make a chocolate kick that being said
i also think she's well within her
rights to say no and it definitely i
mean it
it it is hard to make you stand with a
with a choosing beggar
she didn't agree in the first place well
if she didn't agree in the first place
then why are we
even having the discussion right sorry
he
well no they didn't say that it's a male
baker
he just said men can also bake
who's the [ __ ] now
it's implied i don't know if it is
implied
i think they were just trying to land a
a snipe to be like
yeah you know frick you
i could be a man
maybe maybe i'm not but i could be
idiots anyway this again this is we're
getting mired in context
in minutia if the op
didn't exist or didn't agree
to cook the original nut-based cake then
this whole issue gets thrown out of
court
you're not the [ __ ] for not making a
chocolate cake
when you also weren't gonna make the
original cake to begin with okay
so there's that's easy enough so we have
to operate on the assumption that
they were at least suggesting that they
were gonna make the nut based cake
because the child liked it
i it's tough okay
i definitely think the mom
is she she stepped over the line
hey my kid really liked this cake
can you make it without the ingredients
that make it taste like it tastes
no all right we'll just take a chocolate
instead that's a lit i wouldn't feel
comfortable doing that
you know i i mean i think you gotta
be a little bit more socially aware than
that however
i i also think the op i mean the way
that it was responded to was a little
bit over the top
i'm going to say that opie had the right
of refusal
the mom overstepped her bounds on top of
that
but the way that both of these people
responded to it
a little bit juvenile i guess is my
that's my take on the subject
and the the edits that i'm gonna say
it's in everybody sucks here
which is sad because it's a story about
a children's a child's chocolate cake
um but the
edits also make me
think that like it it it reflects more
poorly on op's character
like they were totally fine until they
kept talking and then i was like
my mistake so i i think this is in
everybody sucks here
not the oh wow i'm like way in the
minority on this one
i can scroll down but not the [ __ ] 62
percent
you're the [ __ ] 25 percent everybody
sucks here 8
1 in 12 baby you ca i'll count myself as
part of the one in 12 there
i mean i don't here's the thing it
depends on the question are they the
[ __ ]
for not baking the cake
no are they the [ __ ]
for the way that the discussion ended up
becoming kind of a fight
i think kind of but maybe that's not the
question
so maybe if you're answering are they
the [ __ ] for refusing to bake without
nuts
no but i also feel like i would change
the question maybe not the [ __ ]
an [ __ ] um
i i don't know about am i the [ __ ]
for telling my daughters i made a
mistake for choosing to stay in their
lives
and then not the [ __ ]
i mean i guess at this point i gotta
know right
my ex-wife and i got divorced 14 years
ago it was due to infidelity on her part
the divorce was messy i'm just i'm just
scanning through
i don't know this just seems sad that's
that's a sad pivot you get one per
stream
how about this one am i the [ __ ] for
refusing to flush the toilet when i pee
hold on let's let's look at this one
first i think this one i gotta i gotta
have one with like 100
consensus again to get chat back on my
side am i the [ __ ] for not getting a
summer job and still expecting allowance
my parents were really pushing for me 16
to get a summer job this year i chose
not to instead deciding to volunteer at
our town's historical society
hey okay at first i was going to be like
i got away from my halo infinite beta
code but
they're at least they're volunteer
they're doing something
it's super close so i can literally walk
there i really enjoy working there
because i'm learning new things about
our town and preserving historical
materials and because i enjoy talking
with the people who do come in
it's got me interested in becoming an
archivist about twice a week my history
teacher will volunteer too so it's nice
to get to see a different side of him
than i usually do in class
okay let me guess the other reason that
it's awesome is because like
a part-time job you'd be working like 30
to 60 hours a week
and when you volunteer at the historical
society they're like yeah go ahead why
don't you roll in around one
it's it's a long weekend so it's gonna
be a slow day
anyway uh unfortunately for me my
parents have a rule where over the
summer if i want to buy anything
i need to make the money myself for
whatever reason that means i also have
to pay them
a small fee once a week to even just use
the television
which i haven't been able to pay for
over a month what the hell
okay um
i want to see the inverted situation
here which is uh
am i the [ __ ] for making my 16 year
old kid pay me to use the tv
anyway they haven't been able to pay it
for over a month that's sad they haven't
missed it's not been a lot of good
entertainment
this rule has been there since my older
brother got his first job at 15. since
my sister has a job she has money to do
what she wants even though i spend way
more hours a week working than her
my parents have said that they would
give me an allowance if i did an
internship yet they won't consider
giving me an allowance for what i'm
doing now
this is uh a different situation
you know i said like that the details
were irrelevant for some of these other
stories
this one is like the details are the
only thing that's relevant
back up on the allowance uh
versus internship versus volunteer thing
tell me more
about because if you're if your parents
make you pay to use the tv
there's got to be more meat on that bone
like surely you must do you pitch in for
the groceries
you flush the toilet are your showers
limited to like
you know three minutes for free or
something like that's
this strikes me as insane
at dinner i got into an argument with my
parents which i imagine
you know to argue with them i mean if
the tv is costing you money you're gonna
have to
you know give up your birthday money to
get half an hour of face time
they told me that volunteering at the
historical society isn't something that
warrants
an allowance and i should stop being
lazy and get an internship somewhere or
a job
i told them that that it was unfair even
though i worked more than my sister does
they won't even let me watch television
they explained to me that working at the
historical society doesn't teach skills
that will be valuable to me in the
future and called it a glorified hobby
i told them that what they said was a
load of crap and then they started
yelling at me
am i the [ __ ] okay
what i'm about to say is a little bit
spicy
tell me your parents homeschooled you
without telling me your parents
homeschooled you
some it just seems like this whole
situation is just like off axis a little
bit
apparently they're not homeschooled
because they see their history teacher
at the historical society
he has a history teacher okay
your parents are uh weird dude
like that's my response here your
parents are weird
i don't know what else to say i because
like i i don't really care about whether
or not
you know you should get an allowance for
working at the historical society
um and all of your parents discussion
about whether or not working at the
historical society is valid or whatever
uh that stuff is just not interesting to
me but i
you've done a great job of hooking me up
with the world building
of having parents who make you pay
a small fee once a week to use the
television they make you buy a weekly
television license
it's some of the craziest [ __ ] i've ever
heard
i need to know more hey let me look at
this for a second okay
so that it says everyone sucks but the
actual verdict
was 50 not the [ __ ] 28
everyone sucks here which i'm assuming
is
second year engineering students being
like his parents are right
you got to learn a job that has some
valuable skills
um if well or you could just go without
tv
uh i i feel like i need to
i don't know if my screen region is
gonna work for this but
let me see if i can get into the
comments of the original post here
here we go let's see how this looks
that was my george lucas voice everybody
sucks here get an actual job if you want
things but them not letting you use the
tv is weird and controlling
yeah i mean kind of i still don't think
the kid
sucks like the tv weird stuff is
definitely real
um but
i mean again i i don't think necessarily
the kids should feel
entitled to an allowance but everything
about the parents forcing them to pay to
use the television is
like asinine to me do i i'm still like i
have so many questions like do you
can you watch the tv for free
or do you need to pay
just to view because if i'm paying to
view
i want control of the remote
like i don't want to just pay you 10
bucks on like saturday and then i got to
sit there and watch
the view or whatever like i want to be
able to put on
hbo or something like that like there's
just so much
going on here or do they just have like
a room with a tv
in it and like a coin slot or something
i don't know
anyway
yeah the tv thing seems way overly harsh
on the parents
it's not as if opi is sat on his arse
vegetating all day he's volunteering and
learning useful skills
maybe a compromise is he gets an
allowance and he's allowed to watch tv
for doing a few chores
although i'd just let the poor kid watch
tv without charging him
um
ladies and gentlemen the nobel uh peace
prize winner
for nicest individual person who would
let their 16 year old
child watch a a tv that had
presumably already been paid for that's
taking the moral high ground
let's let's see what else we got here
right sorry collapse you can collapse
the i'm learning i'm learning to be less
of a boomer
everybody sucks here those are harsh
rules and i think making you pay for
using stuff in the house normally free
is bs but the problem is with the
expectation of money
you can't do that especially not at your
age at
what because it was kind of like almost
a little
following if not with you but what do
you mean especially at your age
as a child isn't that like one of the
only times you can expect
to get money for nothing from your
parents
everybody sucks here your parents are a
bit too strict charging for a tv
i'm a grouchy old dad and i didn't even
do that
people are like
people are like look you should get a
job but
they should also let you watch the tv
for free
as for you you approach it all wrong
telling your parents they're full of
crap is not advice given in how to win
friends and influence people oh yes this
is from the
the reddit user proud boomer
who thinks that uh the bible for social
interaction
is uh a sales handbook written in like
1925.
this is the kind of guy when you meet
him he asks your name and then he just
repeats it like 75 times in conversation
with you
until you either get creeped out or
hypnotized
you want credit for working hard show
them the path you've laid out
be polite apologize for the crap comment
let them know that they got through to
you and you'd like to share your
thoughts in a polite conversation
send send them a a summons for
non-binding
arbitration
i love this what what is your potential
income
and what does the job market look like
bro he's 16
potential income dog [ __ ] job market
[ __ ] horrible what do you think what
do you think the job market looks like
he's in like 10th grade
it's that's crazy man that's that's some
of the most
ridiculous stuff i've ever heard in my
entire life
all right yeah there we go hey we
finally we scrolled until we found a
comment we agreed with
not the [ __ ] charging you money to
watch tv is bad [ __ ] insane and
volunteer work is just as valuable as
employment oh man
this is this is good i love this a lot
of people are saying everybody sucks
here and he needs to grow up and learn
about the real world
implying that you can enjoy something
and make money with it holy s
this modern day mentality is rough to
try and follow we just normalize hating
our lives just so we can survive okay
that one i read the first part of it and
i was like i'm with it and then i
realized this is a chat comment and
that's fine
i i am surprised by the amount of people
though that like are leaving comments
not acknowledging that the child is 16
years old
like if they were like 30
and they wanted an allowance from their
parents and their parents were like you
got to try to stand on your own two feet
a little bit more than that and like
maybe make sacrifices
um you know that
maybe you have to sacrifice doing
something that you enjoy a lot
in order to get to the point where
instead you know you can pay for your
own bills that's something
but uh at 16 it's it's crazy
as a parent hold on as a parent
say something about as a parent say
something about the tv
not the [ __ ] because of the tv thing
it's not costing them extra to let you
watch it i'm glad that more people are
talking about this
the tv thing is is insane
i've never heard anything like that
before in my life
as a parent i agree with the person who
said as a parent okay
i think we got one more oh man we we do
have a
we do have uh i don't know if this is an
update but very similar from
last week am i the [ __ ] [ __ ] for
purposely leaving my car parked out in
front of a stranger's house for even
longer after he rudely asked me to move
it
[ __ ] post deleted great stuff man
it's there's so much uh so many parking
related uh am i the [ __ ]
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to flush
the toilet when i pee
oh my god this is weird i know but it'll
be short and to the point
the thing is like it's gonna be weird
but it's also gonna be short and and to
the point which is
is good anyway um
anyway i pee a lot i think it's an
incredible waste to flush the toilet
every time you pee
to me doing that is the weird thing it's
completely normal for me to just leave
short shortened to the point by the way
let me restate this sentence
that was very clear the first time 30 or
40 times uh it's completely normal for
me to leave my pee in the toilet and
really only flush for poo i don't see
the issue with this but my boyfriend
hates it
he says it's absolutely disgusting and i
act like an animal doing that he
shouldn't be subjected to my bodily
fluids just because
i want to be a cheapskate hey some guys
would uh pay extra for that hi
oh i don't know i can see his point i
guess but honestly i don't really see
the issue i i can see his point
on the one hand on the other hand i
don't really see his point
plus it's my house we've been talking i
was gonna say it's my car
plus it's my house we've been talking
about him moving in but he says not
flushing after every use is a
non-starter and he won't even consider
moving in with me until i promise to
always flush
i'm considering just breaking up with
him no this is fake i don't
okay let's pretend it's real i'm
considering just breaking up with him
because i have no desire to stop it's an
ingrained
if this is real you need to actually
break up to save him from you
because this is like if you can't
compromise on flushing the toilet when
you pee
like then you you're not going to be
able to make it work
on like because this is such a minor
thing right like you'd literally have to
agree on
everything you're like
flush after i urinate absolutely not
uh anyway that's a deal breaker
uh it's an ingrained habit i don't feel
like putting in the work to stop that's
that's a good sign that you're ready for
a
serious relationship plus i genuinely
feel like i'm saving water from being
wasted on top of that it saves me money
on my water and electric bill am i crazy
is this something everyone would be
disgusted by or is this bizarre behavior
should i just suck it up and start
flushing everything should i just suck
it up and
start flushing every time i pee
could i could i shoulder the incredible
burden of sucking it up every time i pee
at this point i don't even know who's
the crazy one here
it's already tldr it's already short af
if you don't want to read a single
paragraph then i don't know what to tell
you law
and then moving on
okay so from what i've gathered from the
comments this habit is not
overwhelmingly considered right or wrong
and seems to be a cultural thing some
people have said it's
absolutely disgusting or bizarre while
other people have said they've always
lived this way and have never seen the
problem
generally though you all agree this is
something i'd be willing to stop if i
cared enough about the relationship and
honestly this made me realize you're
right
that is not the word i expected to be
there
uh i expected it wrong but that's okay
i hadn't considered that my lack of
desire to put in the work of breaking a
lifelong habit is indicative of my
lukewarm feelings towards my
relationship
thank you for pointing it out i
appreciate everyone's perspective on
this
you i so i think what i i people are
saying good ending
that's not the way i'm taking this
though i think she's saying
you're right i clearly don't care about
my boyfriend very much so i'm gonna
break up with him
rather than you're right this is a
limited amount of compromise that is
emblematic of wanting to save my
relationship
which could be again the first one could
be fine
if you're not willing to compromise
flushing the toilet for your boyfriend
you know it's a good ending for him
especially maybe
but at the same time i think she got
maybe
the wrong lesson from it she's like my
significant other or letting my urine
fester in the toilet until i actually
take a poop on top of it
uh and then flush it down
she chose she chose to poop on her piss
that's what she chose
i i if i were the if i were the
significant other i would be a little
upset
kill me
[Laughter]
anyway second edit oh here we go
what does flushing a toilet have to do
with an electric with electricity my
well water is well water and uses a pump
which is electric
literally you spent
more money typing that out than the
electrical cost of using your toilet if
i had to guess
like this is literally like focusing on
the pennies and making the pounds take
care of themselves
no one's ever like hey i mean the water
sure
but like oh man my electric bill is
getting so high i gotta stop uh
i gotta stop flushing so much look she's
i know she's
the water stuff is fair okay
i mean water is pretty cheap here but i
don't know if that's the case everywhere
and it gets recycled at like 99.999
efficiency or something by the
wastewater treatment plant but
regardless
the water i i at least give it a sense
but the the actual electricity i don't
know about that
how often do you flush ip on average
once every 90 minutes
that uh honestly you're you're preaching
to the choir on this one i go to the
bathroom frequently
throughout the day i'll flush every five
or six p's
and i always flush during my final pee
before bed that's [ __ ]
insane
are you keeping a tally on the like on
the bathroom wall or something
you flush every five or six ps i do want
to know what happens when she has a
she's peed once and then she has to poo
does she pre-flush
poo and then flush or does she poop on
the p
because i feel like if you poop on the p
that's dirty as hell
that's bad you so you've got to
pre-flush the p
to begin with like i feel like she's not
getting
all the value out of this that she
thinks she is
so i got to put a rush in on this so i
can be there for justin
do i flush a bunch of tp all at once i
actually don't flush tp ever i have a
small bidet i only need a little tp
which i toss in the trash
sure okay fair enough and yes the
miniscule amount of water this uses is
much preferable to the gallons of water
that would be flush daily
again we we have uh okay maybe she's
talking about from a financial
standpoint she's not talking about a
wastewater treatment plant
i can understand i mean i think if
you're using a bidet i don't know
i mean i feel like you still just put it
in the toilet that's where the toilet
paper goes but
do i not have more than one bathroom i
do and have already offered to only use
one and he can use the other this is not
acceptable to him
one final thing i'd like to add for
people saying peace thinks i highly
suggest you up your water intake yeah i
get it your personality is being the
person who goes to the bathroom all the
time and is like really proud of their
piss
like congrats
other people like have real problems not
me but like in general
oh yeah sorry yeah sorry for saying piss
stinks uh
i was on call at the hospital as a
trauma surgeon in the er for 36 hours so
i didn't get that much time to
you know up my electrolyte count thanks
a lot yeah you're right i should just
drink more water
yeah i'm i'm a big you're the [ __ ] on
this one quite frankly
i don't know why she's so proud of her
piss
i also the economic argument does not
hold for me
what percentage of your monthly utility
bill
is uh is the toilet
it's got to be like under five percent
considering all the other things you do
in your house like you know
your shower water i guess water for
cooking is not that much compared to the
toilet
i guess she does pee a lot under one
percent
she better not have an air conditioner
that's all i'm saying anyway she's like
a little crazy
she's a little she's a little pee crazy
she's got p on the brain
either way slash marker



i i do want to check out we want plates
but we've actually gotten some some
great posts i'm gonna i'm gonna keep
going down this a little bit here
uh just cause we we've we've gotten some
really spicy ones today honestly
like these these have been genuinely the
first couple were a little
milk toast these ones are getting to
some
some interesting territory where i
disagree a lot which is
is new to me
so many so many
red flares what about this one
uh am i the for nagging my
sister into getting pregnant earlier
that's gonna be a weird one am i the
 for telling my ex-co-workers
employer the reason why she was
ostracized at the company
my ex-co-workers employer okay
let's see
this sounds bad it sounds like you're
the
it's a billion paragraphs long it has
like 15 edits oh man okay 4 500 comments
this story actually takes place over
multiple years oh you don't say
george rr martin
malding right now
we'll try to go fast
uh here goes also english isn't my first
language so i apologize for my poor
language skills in advance a little
background i work in corporate hr my
company is a very generous maternity
leave policy it gives you 26 paid weeks
off and the option of taking a month or
so more if you have extra sick or
personal leaves left or else you can
take unpaid leave for the same time okay
so there's 26 paid weeks that's like
it's like six months that's that's
pretty good so part of my
responsibilities is to make
recommendations for selecting employers
or employees for specific projects
so a couple of years ago there was a
huge project that needed a team to be
created for being part of a project like
this would normally establish your
career in the industry you could decide
your own career path based on the
reputation you get based on a project
like this it would be hectic and
difficult but worth it in the end let me
guess
i'm just guessing
i'm just guessing
i didn't want to select anybody that
might have the audacity to be planning
on getting pregnant and then they had
that
son of a got pregnant
and i took that personally because it
reflected poorly on me for not being
nostradamus that's just my guess
that's my guess of what's happening
we interviewed prospective people within
the company and selected a core team
that would take it up among this team
was emma a recently married female who
was generally thought to be a hard
worker and quite knowledgeable like with
everyone else we interviewed her for the
spot and asked her if she wanted to be
part of it however a month or so in emma
announces that she was pregnant and that
she would be taking her maternity leave
in a month's time she would be
completely unavailable for around seven
months and basically leave the team
short staffed for the major part of the
project we had to quick quickly select
the replacement get them up to speed and
have them take over it meant more work
for everyone minor delays etc etc this
someone in chat said this is capsaicin
level spicy and it absolutely is because
even we're only four paragraphs in here
and i'm
like let me start by saying i can
understand
in the most generous reading possible
that somebody would be like
i if they were planning on getting
pregnant or maybe they already were
pregnant
um but just weren't announcing it yet
uh
it would have been nice if you had let
hr know that so that we could have
discriminated against you by not putting
you on this project that's gonna make
your career
however
i also feel like if you don't exercise
and i don't work in the corporate
environment okay but i feel like if you
don't exercise um
you know your rights by
it sounds like she was appointed to the
project as a
you know it was a meritocracy she
interviewed for it she got the project
uh and and earned it if you don't go for
that
uh
even if you are pregnant you're just
screwing yourself over it's not like the
company is gonna be like oh thanks for
not uh doing that career advancing move
in advance of you trying to establish a
family now we're going to give you a
promotion if it you know in the future
it might end up biting her in the ass if
she had been
nice about it because if she's going up
against other candidates that that
played the game a little bit better she
would be at a disadvantage
moreover
just the post-existing just makes me mad
because i'm like
i
look
not everybody
most most people will probably agree i
think but not everybody will agree but
uh
you know
your life is your life and your career
you know it's it's your job like this is
two very
different priorities and i think they
they
change weightings in your life for sure
like when when you're younger before you
you know
have a long-term serious relationship or
before you're thinking about having kids
or something like maybe you're not
thinking about like your health or
something like that your career could be
your life but
you know the idea like that oh what what
a for putting her career on the
back burner to take advantage of her
relatively narrow window to start the
family that she wants to have like
that's crazy
that that someone would would try to
hold that against them anyway so so far
i think we're that that's where i'm at
four paragraphs in
let's keep it moving
um
what pissed off the top management was
that m knew she was pregnant when she
joined the team she never mentioned it
during the interview because then we
would have not uh hired her by not
telling anyone in advance everyone felt
that she can't be trusted in the future
she basically became a pariah and no
team lead wanted her in any of the
critical projects
wow um
[Laughter]
that's pretty bad
also like yeah it seems insanely illegal
you're not supposed to admit that part
i think you're you're just supposed to
like uh do it but not tell anybody like
don't send any emails or make any posts
or anything like that because if you
ever end up in court you're gonna get
you know raked over the coals
she's gonna take you for all you're
worth
within a year em realized she progressed
much in her career at this particular
company and left for another job i
wonder why
[Laughter]
after she had the audacity to get
pregnant and make all of us do a little
bit
it meant more work for everybody minor
delays etc etc
um she she decided finally to leave um
fast forward a little while i was
talking with the hr guy from the company
emma joined and he asked me about her
this seems like
i don't know if this is like a violation
of privacy rights or something
emma joined he asked me about her i told
him the truth
both that she was a good worker and is
dedicated but that she is not honest or
trustworthy
what
because she got pregnant
because she's not honest
or trustworthy oh my god sorry sorry i i
need to scroll down a little bit here
that's crazy man now this basically
meant that m gets a similar treatment at
the new company she is considered a good
employee or team player but no one wants
to select her for any critical projects
why you're just like a piece of
then huh
it's not enough that you did it to her
for essentially no good reason when she
was at your company now she goes to a
new company because you guys treated her
like garbage and then you torpedoed her
there as well
some of my friends say that telling hr
about the incident makes an ass with two
dollars
it has gotten me to feel a bit guilty oh
oh well we wouldn't want what to happen
that op feels a little guilty for
terrorizing a woman for two different uh
employees or two different employers
just because of the fact that they they
shed something that might be a wiggle
i wasn't sure what the right move should
be ps feel free to ask for more
information if you need it i've already
uh said the quiet part loud and uh in
court will lose my entire life savings
um i might as well just keep going uh i
just want to be clear em knew she was
pregnant did i mention that part like
she was exercising her human rights uh
you know and then
acting appropriately given the labor
laws of the uh country she lives in uh
she wanted to be in the project so she
didn't disclose that she was pregnant
her team
you're thinking a lot about this
lady
you're not you're not thinking at all
about her team
they had to pick up the slack on this
one man the company had no choice
there was absolutely nothing well the
ceo probably could have taken a 0.05
cut to their salary to hire another
equally able person to do that but no
there's nothing that could have been
done she torpedoed this multi-million
dollar serious project by just getting
pregnant and not telling us
her team it's not about me it's her team
had to stretch themselves thin to make
it up
our company has a general oh as a
general rule as a general rule we have
no issues with women taking time off for
pregnancy
in specific situations
we may have some issues with as a
general rule we're all for it
we love it
happy families make happy workers but in
this one unique situation
uh we're gonna treat you i believe their
words were um it pissed off the top
management uh she was she could can't be
trusted in the future she became a
pariah no team lead wanted her in any
critical projects uh
i told the other hr rep that she's a
good worker but she's not honest or
trustworthy
but in general we don't have issues
legally speaking if a lawyer is asking
us is a general rule we don't have
issues in specific situations we might
break the law
in order to just ruin someone else's uh
professional life just to be petty
but as a rule
we're all for it
even beyond the policy mandated time the
most i've come across as a woman getting
15 months off she came back to work and
faced no repercussions
at first i thought you were you were an
and i'm happy to admit that i was so
wrong
because
now you've you've pointed out that a
woman has taken advantage of all of the
uh
maternity leave that she's entitled to
and she didn't even face any
repercussions
thought for sure you would bring her
back and then maybe after that you know
you would maybe treat her as a pariah or
uh gossip about how she's on trustworthy
to every other employer within her
industry but she didn't even face any
repercussions
and you're gonna say that they're the
i should have mentioned this before but
the hr guy was formally asking me about
m it wasn't like i was talking about her
at the pub i don't work in hr but this
actually like almost feels worse to me
like i think if you were intoxicated at
the
pub i would be like you know maybe loose
lips sink ships or whatever but wait
can you formally ask
about an employee i guess if they phone
you on your work phone that's a formal
ask
i don't know where people got the idea
that she was just a month into the
pregnancy when she was interviewed
just to clarify she was pregnant long
enough that she knew she wouldn't be
completing the project everybody's
talking about her feelings nobody's even
thinking about the feelings of the
cement plant that we were building
nobody's talked nobody has asked how the
cement plant feels about this
everybody's just worried about the human
being it's crazy
she didn't mention it because she wanted
the project on her resume bro everybody
gets this
everybody knows she didn't mention it
because she wanted to be on the project
because if she told you that was that
she was pregnant you clearly would not
have selected her for a project that
she's worthy of being on
our company never punishes an employee
for taking maternity leave
obviously
it's still
every every point of defense that they
offer in this post is literally we
follow the law
okay
we followed the legal rule of the law
except for like a couple of times when i
gossip um but like
in this one specific situation
i really think that she should have let
us discriminate against her
but in this case the team lead did not
want her on their team
for high profile projects after she
returned because they didn't trust her
to be forthright
because if she was forthright you
wouldn't
have hired her for the project which
would have put her further back in her
career
just to benefit a company that in all
likelihood especially based on this post
doesn't actually care for her well-being
whatsoever
i thought it would be obvious but our
source for m's motivations were m
herself she admitted all of this herself
so does that change anything that she
admitted that she knew she was pregnant
when she applied for the job
and just to clarify i didn't put out a
blanket statement of her trustworthiness
even though i said
she's not really honest or trustworthy
i explained the incident and explained
it due to this her co-workers consider
her untrustworthy it is in me
i don't consider her untrustworthy i
just said to the other hr rep nobody
thinks she's trustworthy
there's it wasn't me
i didn't say i think she can't be
trusted i said nobody thinks she can be
trusted
by the way i'm i'm losing my mind
because the uh judgment here
not the 50 you're the 47
percent
so even though the flare is over
time
the votes tallied and
not the ended up being in in
first
i don't even think this is like a a
super like woke opinion
just like the the
you have an obligation as an employee to
you know propel yourself
as far ahead as possible especially
within the bounds of like legality
and the company just won't give a
about you at all like the lies or the
the laws are there to be exercised you
know
anyway let's let's click on this
okay here we go
you're the laws may be different
where you are
but in america what you did would be an
illegal move we have laws to protect
workers from that kind of
you have no business whatsoever having
that conversation your company your
rules
yeah this is in the usa i assumed the 26
weeks of maternity leave may have clued
everyone else in um maybe you could have
told from the fact that we have a
great maternity leave that there are no
repercussions for exercising usually
that we're in a country that actually
cares about its workers rights except
for um why would it be illegal to share
her performance details with her new
employer and her performance details of
course were getting pregnant and not
telling anybody
hey ladies just remember
when you see that pregnancy test when
you see those two lines pop up the first
phone call you gotta make is to your
boss okay
it is not nice
to not let your boss know first then
father of the child
maybe your parents if they've if they've
done their essay recently
100 you're the she didn't have
to tell you she was pregnant
when interviewing for a project what you
did was ethically wrong as someone in hr
you should have known better than to do
that
yeah um yeah
if you're in the u.s she could sue you
yes
i do have to check like let's look at an
opinion that we don't necessarily agree
with okay
she didn't have to say she was pregnant
the only obligation she had was not
committing to a responsibility she knew
she shouldn't be able she wouldn't be
able to fulfill she chose to make that
commitment in the full knowledge and
intent of not fulfilling it corporate
lawyer spotted the reason for which she
wasn't available is irrelevant she said
she would do something she had no
intention of doing the word for that is
lying and as a direct result of her lie
several colleagues including the other
mothers on the project
is there is there a uh won't somebody
think of the mother's fallacy
[Laughter]
i'm pretty sure that the other mothers
can be asked for their opinion uh if
they existed this situation why don't we
ask the other mothers what they think
about uh what em did in this situation
and see whose side they're on
that would be an interesting
conversation they might not agree with
me i just think that rather than put
words in their mouth it might be good to
ask them
um
had to put in they had to put in
additional labor there was nothing the
company could have done regardless of
what legalities may or may not obtain
morally op is in the clear regardless of
the laws that they broke morally they're
in the clear that's important uh for
sharing this relevant information with
her new employer protected category does
not mean exempt from the standards of
ethical behavior
thanks for the gold really thanks for
the gold kind sir okay
uh we disagree let's put it that way
op you may go to prison
but
go there with with a song in your heart
knowing you did the morally right thing
not the
you mentioned in a comment she admitted
to knowing she was pregnant it wouldn't
be there for 80. you may actually you
mentioned in your entire comment uh
about 20 times to knowing that she was
pregnant it wouldn't be there for 80 of
the project but didn't tell anyone
because she wanted it on her resume in
that case she definitely isn't a team
player and admitted to it as well your
honor i may have breached the privacy
standards uh that have been set out in
the charter rights for citizens of this
country but have you considered
the plaintiff
is not a team player
the plaintiff
they didn't give 110 percent they didn't
go into the boards
to try to win hard puck battles they
didn't do the little things right
they're not a team player
hi i have a genuine question about this
for all the you're the responses
i'm a woman and while reading this i
thought he wasn't the i don't
know much about hr work so that could be
it but could someone explain it to me
i'm aware you can't have someone miss
work opportunities because they're
pregnant but she basically missed the
entire project it feels unfair to me
that she would miss
probably 90 of a massive project and
didn't tell anyone can someone help me
out also i understand how he's the
 for telling the hr guy a few
years later but i don't understand how
he was originally
i i am just like and i i i actually like
understand it
because i think if you put yourself in
the position
where you're like uh like imagine you
were doing a group project
and you were like hey you want to be in
my group
and then
a week into a 16-week project they were
like
by the way i'm gonna be like going to
school abroad for the next four months
and i won't be able to help out that
much i think you would be
annoyed a little bit the flip side of
that though is that you know when you're
in the rat race
it's uh
kind of every person out for themselves
and when you're
what's the word i'm looking for here
when you're willfully
not taking advantage of the labor laws
that are given to you as a human being
you're giving the company the benefit of
the doubt and the labor laws are there
so that your company doesn't uh exploit
you because they probably
you know as a as a result of you doing
what you might feel is the nice thing
you would probably end up holding your
career back you know potentially
permanently as a result
so i feel like you you have a resp the
the company has a responsibility to
treat you to the letter of the law and
you have a responsibility to yourself
and your future self to act with you
know within the scope of your rights as
well
yeah not to mention i mean this is not
even uh
worth pointing out necessarily but
uh
you know it's not like she took a
six-month vacation
[Laughter]
like
you know it's probably like a couple of
weeks getting ready for the baby uh
absolutely
uh
terrible 48 hours in the hospital
followed by six months of learning how
to raise a brand new human infant right
and then the other part of this that
pisses me off is everyone's acting like
they're they the company had no choice
but to make the team
like now five people have to do six
people's work why don't you just put
another person
on the project
i don't
understand like there there's so many
other alternatives here
plus they did but they had hey you
forgot the part where they had to get
them up to speed hey you forgot the part
where they had to get him up to speed
man
anyway i'm a woman in hr most people
have their us lens on it's unethical to
knowingly volunteer for a project you
won't be available for just for the
resume pop
look is it unethical
i don't think so
i really don't is it not nice
yeah
i think it's not nice
i think it is kind of a not nice thing
to do
but at the same time i think
i don't know i'm
very unethical i'm trying to think about
i mean i know where i stand on the issue
and you do too if you're listening to me
simultaneously but
like you're there to like that's what
the law is there for
you know if if you
have the right to protect the
information about whether or not you're
pregnant or planning on getting
pregnant in the future because it's
considered a privacy violation because
they can discriminate in hiring
decisions then by keeping that
information private i don't think that's
unethical at all that's what it's there
for
is it unethical from like a greek
philosopher's standpoint i'm like i
don't know who cares
well i guess the thing i'm thinking is
uh would the company also uh be ethical
towards her and based on the response of
the corporate hr here my answer is
probably not uh so
i i feel like
you know i i think she did what she
should have done
hold on let's close this one up
i'm probably going to be down voted for
this but not the they asked for
your opinion and you were honest she was
dishonest in the recruitment process and
cause stress for the team
what a
she the only reason she even had that
baby was to piss us off man
so
selfish couldn't she have just waited
like three years for the project to be
done and then have the baby although
then by getting that uh project done she
probably would have been up for some new
job interviews and possibly could have
started interviewing at new places for a
huge increase in her salary at which
point she wouldn't want to get pregnant
then either because it would be
unethical to like interview for a new
job knowing you have a plan to have a
family in the future so then she would
like go work at a new job she might be
promoted in like a management position
and then she's gonna have the audacity
to have a kid at that point when you
know she's in charge of all these
deliverables for a large like when is it
oh and then she's dead she died of old
age okay well now it's now it's her free
time she can do it whatever she pleases
not the you might get beat up
over that whole pregnancy is private
thing
but it's like anything else if you know
you can't complete a project for any
reason and hide it you deserve a
reputation you don't deserve a
reputation as someone who can be trusted
people are crazy man
i'm like
i i don't know what to say you're the
 a huge one deleted
they must have been cyber bullied man
no woman is required to disclose their
pregnancy and in fact it is illegal to
ask in interviews if it was a man you
never would have done this and your
company wouldn't have blacklisted her
you and your company are misogynistic
punishing a woman for having a child and
then ruining her future opportunities
get over yourself
where's the lie
there's a million reasons she could have
thought she would be able to work
through her pregnancy it's highly
unusual for someone to take maternity
leave during the pregnancy unless it is
a high risk pregnancy that's true
usually at most you know
well you don't want to use much of your
maternity leave in advance or the
pregnancy or in advance of the delivery
i should say because you really need
that time afterwards to get adjusted to
life with the baby like you
i mean sometimes it can happen i guess
but again whether you know you can't
discriminate
whether or not to put someone on a
project based on whether or not their
pregnancy is high risk unless you're
like the devil um
unless it is a high-risk pregnancy we
don't know her history we don't know her
past experiences every single person in
these comments is villainizing her
without even giving her the benefit of
the doubt this wasn't some big
conspiracy or strategic manipulation she
should should she have gotten pregnant
at a more convenient time for her
co-workers
i don't know where you all live and work
but you clearly deserve better labor
laws if you don't see why this is wrong
i can only imagine that you think it's
normal in many places this would never
slide i mean i i agree
i it sucks maybe i'm gonna have to
delete the the vod if i get this kind of
response to it
i'll just get over it i was there for
the pop play
what no
she was already an employee she was
merely being selected for the project
in normal circumstances we would never
ask oh this is opie we would never ask
or expect to be told beforehand about a
pregnancy it's normal
in general we're very pro-pregnancy
we're
we love giving out the legally required
maternity leave as a general rule we
would never expect to be told beforehand
but again in this one specific location
or situation we're not asking you to
tell us you're you're planning on
getting pregnant we're just asking to
for you to forgo
any and all opportunities
if you're planning at some point and
having a family
but when she was offered a spot to the
project team we expected her to inform
us she wouldn't be available for about
80 of the period no woman would be
punished for having a child if that was
true do you honestly think we'd have
such a maternity leave policy
so i look i there's two people i want to
hear from here okay
i want to hear from the perspective of
the other mothers on the team
and then secondarily i also want to hear
from the i want to know what the project
was
wouldn't it be great if they work at
like party city and it was like a
refresh for like what their halloween
costumes are going to look like
halloween 2022.
would that change your opinion on this
or if they worked at uh yum brands
incorporated and they were trying to
figure out how to tweak the recipe for
the wendy's spicy chicken sandwich
[Laughter]
like i've been i've been operating on
the assumption that this is like some
kind of infrastructure construction
project or something like that how funny
would it be if it was like you know we
need to figure out
what the movie poster
for the new black panthers gonna look
like we gotta composite it you can't
afford to take six months off from this
this is a big deal
anyway this is uh i you know what there
is some arguments here don't get me
wrong but this is uh
pardon me this is uh this is what it's
all about man is spice and and spice is
nice
when it comes to the the react content
at least i mean we were on that one for
like like half an hour
i don't know my
in this situation my my perspective it's
going to be very hard to to tilt me
off of the idea that if she's operating
within her legal rights anything that
she can do to uh
advance her career if it's only at the
expense of the feelings of the
corporation she works for then you know
that's what you got to do because uh i i
would expect that the company would
leave her in the lurch as well
that's my take on that
also her co-workers though
i i think her co-workers should be of
the opinion that why can't we just i
mean they put another person on the
project right
admittedly uh the the biggest project
i've ever done in my life was probably
like three months long it was a little
game i made in unity for like a
programming class
[Laughter]
so i've never built a nuclear reactor or
you know like a big wind farm or
something like that but
i would like to think that if i was
working on a project like that uh and
then my company
uh said hey we got to take someone off
the team and put someone new on i'd be
like why and they'd be like oh she's
having a baby and i'd be like oh
congrats
i don't know maybe i i haven't been in
the corporate environment long enough to
when the doors close everything becomes
like succession and you just how dare
she
how dare she make me for the next week
respond to more emails and sign more
forms or something like i don't
admittedly i don't know and i'm only
coming from the perspective of what i
know i'm not saying that's how the real
world works but that's that's where i
fell on that issue
she didn't even give the calico cut
pants
i and the other thing is i think you got
to put it on the flip side
you know if she
goes
i'm going to get pregnant they don't put
her on the project
she takes her maternity leave if you put
if you put the if you play the tape
forward for like
you know 10 years on that what is it
getter
is the company under any obligation in
the future to
uh
be like hey she you know did right by us
in the past so next time we get a
project we're going to give her a leg up
like no it's that's like a handshake
wink wink sort of deal right
so i think she's got to take you know
her opportunity to
you know to get ahead when she can and
it's she did it on merit it's not like
she was stabbing people in the back
also it's not even just that
is she the for not admitting to
the pregnancy in the first place which
again who cares in my opinion at least i
don't work for the company obviously
though unless it was amazon in which
case you're stealing food out of my
kid's mouth
um
the other
question is should she have been
outed for this at her new company and
that one i think i'd
definitely i'm like you should just keep
your mouth shut dude i understand you
got a chip on your shoulder but
anyway
we're moving on
am i the for selling my vacation
apartment to one daughter even though my
other daughter asked for it first am i
the for being rich
no
but let's
let's see where this goes
okay everyone
so many people in chat were like
you you we hate you not to me but
to the the poster hello lovely people
have read it that's the first like one
word or one sentence
for some context i'm a 78 year old woman
living alone
are you going to change your your tune
now
she seems like an unaffable lady so far
i know you were you thought it was john
taffer didn't you
i bet you thought it was john tafford
no yes i own a house that i live in and
my children grew up in in a beachfront
apartment this is where our family
vacation often when the children were
growing up i have two daughters that
i'll call violet and rose in this story
okay so your children are in their you
know their middle age health issues have
led me to be unable to maintain this
apartment so i was looking to sell
i mean yeah names have been
changed to protect the innocent uh let's
uh let's just call one of them desdemona
and the other one
it's anyway um
so i was looking to sell i mentioned
this briefly to violet last year during
the stage where i only considered
selling and she said when i was ready
she would buy it i said that would be
lovely and the conversation ended
when i decided to officially sell three
months ago i told violet and rose and to
my surprise rose also offered to buy it
she never mentioned wanting to buy this
but she had been looking at other
holiday properties around the area
neither of them were budging on their
offer so i suggested they co-buy it
which was meant with a firm no from both
of them for reasons i won't get into
they were never close unfortunately
after deliberating for some time i made
the decision to offer it to
uh the open market as a result of this
situation because i worried that it
would create negative feelings uh in my
family if i chose uh one of the
daughters over the other one
nope
i decided to offer it to rose despite
the fact that violet asked for it first
for several reasons rose is only a two
hour drive away and would get more use
out of it rose was already visiting it
at least once every two to three months
while violet visits it once every one to
two years violet lives across the
country about a four hour plane ride
away with coveted lockdowns that makes
it difficult for her to come honestly i
do have to say that seems like a pretty
good reason
rose is married with three children that
love the beach while violet is on
married with a partner but no kids and
is out of child bearing age of that
matters
not something that typically comes out
up in the real estate buying process but
you got her i guess my eldest
granddaughter was already strongly
considering living in it before i
announced selling it because she has
plans on attending college university
about 20 minutes away
this
look would i would i
maybe have suggested just selling it uh
on the open market to avoid uh family
drama maybe but these seem like one in
three in particular seem like good
reasons to give it to to sell it to one
over the other i believe selling derose
means the apartment will get more use
and enjoyment and violet will still be
able to visit for vacations if rose
permits and isn't using it however
violet is extremely upset and refuses to
talk to both rose and i she believes i'm
disadvantaging her because hey it's like
the the the flip side
rose is what happens when you exercise
your legal rights to have
children in the middle of a work project
and violate is what happens when you
choose to be career focused see you and
then people start having kids the people
that have kids get concessions because
they have kids and you're out here like
i gave up that time in order to advance
my career and i'm getting still hit over
it and they're like yeah but at least
you behaved ethically the whole time um
no kids no cottage it's that simple at
the end of the day it's my apartment i
believe i have the right to choose who
to sell to violet has offered to pay
more for the apartment in an attempt to
sway me healthy family environment for
sure
um
get get your kids involved in a bidding
war
um over your vacation home just because
of the fact that uh they don't like each
other apparently at the end of the day
i'm a nearly 80 year old woman racked
with health issues to put it bluntly i
don't have many years left in me and i
don't care about the money so am i the
 for choosing to sell to rose
dude i'm i don't know what happened to
me over the past couple of
weeks i'm like i'm off my freaking
rocker man
you're the 48 not the 39
percent well where do i fall on this
imo not the but let's read the
edit at least
i i do have to say by the way the am i
the for choosing to sell the
rose even though my other daughter asked
for it first
uh if you're if your children in this
dispute are like
you know in their 50s
asking for it first is not like that's
like a schoolyard law
this is not how we settle
you know disputes especially over stuff
that's this serious once you enter the
adult world
mom
i called shotgun
i i licked the wall and said my germs
and now you're gonna sell it to
violet instead or rose i can't keep it
straight anyway
i feel conflicted so i would like some
outside opinions i appreciate all these
comments i do not favor rose for having
ch now i i can understand on reddit why
she ended up being the you're
the for discriminating against
your own daughter for not having kids
post history r slash child free r slash
antinatalism
r slash uh a boring dystopia our slash
late stage capitalism
etc etc um i was nearly like violet i
didn't get married until i was 37 by
choice and didn't have children until i
was 38 and 41 because i focused on my
career i thought i would never want to
get married or have children
critical hit oh no
okay okay let's i just want to read the
comments okay
you're the violet asked you
first
and you're
to be fair she did say that would be
lovely
it sounded like you were supportive of
her buying it your reasons for selling
at the rose are arbitrary and
essentially assumptions on your part i
don't blame violet for being upset with
you how you responded to the situation
appears to be favoritism look
oh my god i i refuse to read this
you you know how to use reddit
formatting that's you've self-selected
that i will not read your comment i'm
sorry that's rude i'm still not going to
read it but i apologize um
i disagree with the judgment on this one
that being said
i do
understand that she did say
hey mom i'll buy the vacation home off
of you and then you said that would be
lovely now
at the same time that might have come up
casually speaking
you know
as like maybe i'll sell it one day
that's not an offering that's not an
invitation to like you have the
exclusive right of first refusal to to
buy something but i could understand how
the original violet's feelings could be
heard over this
i i even see math in it i anyway hold on
moving on you're the all the
reasons you've stated for this are
horrible
you are disadvantaging her because she
chose her career instead of having a
family i look i admittedly i'm playing
into op's head cannon
but i definitely
i mean if you have the option to sell a
property
within your family to somebody who's who
lives one to two hours away or somebody
that lives a four hour plane ride away
and also doesn't use it too much
it seems like you make the right thing
you made the right decision by
offering did not give it but like sell
it to the person who uses it more often
and can use it more often easily in the
future
rose is getting much more use out of the
apartment the fact that she has kids who
are also going helps in that favor she
lives closer visits more often keeps the
place more up more often the most
logical choice is rose it's fine that
violet chose to have her career and
that's wonderful but that's not the only
issue it would be illogical it's not
playing favorites it's literally
illogical i do agree
everyone else is focused on the wrong
things not the
have you considered the dibs though have
you considered the dib factor
you're the if both wanted it and
neither wanted to co-own it i would have
sold it to a stranger i do agree with
that
for sure
that's that's a good take in my opinion
but i am also like you know
it does sound like like the character
known as rose is using it much more
frequently and uh and as a result of
that i'm like uh you know maybe it was
better to not put it on the open market
it seems like rose has a sentimental
connection and is getting use out of it
with this handled i i suspect op is also
the reason her girls aren't close tell
me you're uh a psycho without telling me
you're a psycho i've read four sentences
about uh someone's life
hey you're the reason your daughters
don't talk even though they're
adults in their 40s
[Laughter]
please don't make such assumptions oh my
god they were in a fatal car crash that
killed their father when they were only
13 and 15.
their relationship has never healed from
these events
so knowing this you decided to sell your
apartment in this manner which could
only result in resentment especially
when you decided the one who had kids
was more deserving
oh my god
and they ratioed her that's the worst
part out of all this
81 posts you're a bad mom 82 posts
actually there was an indescribably bad
family trauma that happened
86 upvotes
don't care didn't ask plus you're old
that's that's insanity man
[Laughter]
don't care didn't ask plus your ratio
you fell off
all right well um
i think we got one more in us
actually i think we got two more in us
because the one that's two away looks
really good
hold up we'll go fast i promise okay
i just i i
wonder about these people that just go
into every discussion trying to win you
know
and the worst part about it is that i
think that if you spend too much time
online you think that that's what all
interactions are like and as a result
you then get infected with that
and you go through life thinking that
every interaction is you know there's a
winner and a loser and then it's just
like it spreads
like a like a
fungal colony or something
how about just like
i think you should have sold it to a
third party
but i can understand your reasons for
selling it to rose
instead it's like you're a bad mom
uh actually they
suffered something indescribably tragic
that forced them apart from one another
don't care didn't ask
shut up everyone who's a bad moms uh
give context bad moms give context
am i the for nagging my sister
into getting pregnant earlier
i'm 28 and my sister is 36. we've always
been close and on good terms
well until mom sells the vacation
apartment one thing that always annoyed
me we've always been close one thing
though that always annoyed me is that
she's the kind of person who believes in
the power of energy to the point where
she refuses to go to the hospital and
claims she can heal any illness she has
on her own the the roller coaster i was
like we've always been close she does
annoy me she believes in the power of
energy and she can heal disease with the
power of her mind okay fair enough
i think she's lucky she's never faced
serious medical issues visibly so far
she's been married for six years they
wanted to enjoy life before having kids
he says he's ready but she refuses and
he's respecting her wishes
she says she's
he says he's ready but she refuses and
he's respecting her wishes she says
she's ready now
oh okay but she communicated with her
spiritual guides
who told her to start having children
when she is 44. they said four kids so
she might be having kids well into her
50s if that's even possible
that's a that's a prickly situation
i know that it's better for women to get
pregnant before 40 we know how many
people who had kids in their 40s and
those kids had serious issues you sure
okay that's not like anecdote is not uh
data but i understand what you're
getting that um
i mean even if it's biologically
possible i guess the risk of a high-risk
pregnancy goes up
every time she brings up this weird plan
of hers
aptly described i suppose
i tell her she's being reckless and
isn't taking into account the serious
risks she doesn't listen to me and is
stubborn in her thinking
thinking yet she keeps bringing it up
around me two weeks ago i was talking
with them at a family gathering and she
brought up her weird pregnancy plan
i told her she was being unrealistic and
once again pointed out we don't okay yes
yes yes she said it's because they
lacked the connection she had with the
spiritual realm i replied with something
along the lines of you're an idiot and
then turned to her husband and said i
hope you have a good excuse ready for
your kids for going along with this
nonsense she's been upset since then
it's the first time she actually got
upset about my reaction
she refuses to talk to me and i know for
my brother that her and her husband are
fighting about this issue even today my
brother and others in the family think i
was an for what i said even
though all of them are also against her
pregnancy plan yeah that's um
look i i feel like this is
this is a classic example of
you're the you're the but also
you're right
this happens from time to time you know
great idea in delicate execution
i think that
sometimes this is a situation where i
think
it well you i wouldn't even say that
she's being an to be honest i
would say she's being impolite
and she's
breaching social norms for sure
but this is not like you know
disagreeing with somebody
uh on something trivial and then being
like you you know whole grain
tostitos are better than white corn
tostitos
this is a situation that potentially has
like serious long-term health
ramifications right
so even though it's an move it's
about a it's about a very serious issue
and i think it comes from a place of uh
of care about her sister and her
sister's family and she just seems
concerned to me i say not the
i'm not even i don't need to look at the
comments i already know what they look
like this is what i wanted to see oh my
god they they just keep getting better
am i the for getting pissed at
my gf for spam calling me at 3am after
clubbing when i was asleep
am i the for not shutting up at
4am
am i the for telling my
mother-in-law it's inappropriate to
bring something up i did as a team to
embarrass me in my own shower
am i the for shutting my wife
out of the blender buying process
there's a lot of good stuff there man
this is our hard stop though okay
i know i got it i gotta read the blender
one
a little context i have a hard time
sleeping i've recently fallen into a
good sleeping routine meaning i've been
falling asleep at 9pm to 11pm which is
usually unheard of for me respect i'm a
borderline insomniac when i wake up out
of sleep it's hard for me to return to
sleep and my girlfriend knows this she
also knew i would be asleep because she
checks snap maps constantly to see when
i was last on plus i hadn't replied to
any of her snaps in hours which i don't
usually do can somebody in chat tell me
what the this means
she checks snap map
snap maps constantly to see when i was
last on plus i hadn't replied to any of
her snaps and hours which i don't
usually do
snapchat snap
maps
are posts that are geotagged so it
checks your location
is that is that correct
not really but yes
okay
you can just do that
[Laughter]
you have to you have to enable it
oh okay that's crazy man
snap
chat snap maps
you have to disable it
it's enabled by default
oh my god
people are worried about the damn
vaccine
you could check on your boyfriend's snap
map on snapchat and see oh don't worry
about him he's asleep
look he's got a little pip in his house
here that's crazy man
um
anyway
eddie
oh okay
we weren't even at oh the edit comes in
the middle it's an edit in media res
by spam call i mean she had rang me two
times prior i hadn't woken up for the
third call woke me up she spam calls me
at 3am walking home alone from the club
when she feels unsafe okay you're the
kind of
let's go further but like the word
unsafe definitely uh
it does a lot of heavy lifting there
furthermore she also okay well
she feels unsafe and wants to talk to me
on the way back despite knowing about my
sleep issues okay like
would i be annoyed yes
for sure
and i don't think the boyfriend as so
far has done anything wrong
at all like i don't think he's
like he goes to sleep she's at the club
who cares
right
i would be annoyed but if she's like i
don't feel safe please talk to me right
now
you gotta you gotta do the conversation
or break up with her
those are your two options
furthermore she also knew i had to be up
early to get a train home from my
university that she didn't take any
notice of she asks if i'm angry with her
i reply yes because she's walking home
alone when she had the option to go home
with a friend which would have been
safer she didn't want to stay an extra
hour so she left early on her own and
because i'm awake it's going to take me
a very long time to get to sleep again i
said it was selfish of her and she had
little concern for me i also find the
lack of care for her safety a big issue
because it's a 34 40 minute walk home in
complete darkness that's all very fair
i gotta say he pulled me back a little
bit
he
he's not he's not on the moral high
ground
for being
super pissed about being woken up
but being like hey if you had planned
properly you could have just taken a cab
home or something
you like you put yourself in this
situation and it's inconsiderate of you
that makes sense to me yeah i can see
that
by the way great time to have this
discussion is at like three in the
morning when one party is sober and the
other party is probably intoxicated but
anyway
uh we get into an argument on the phone
as she's walking back and she's accusing
me of not caring enough for her and says
that i'm in the wrong for being mad if
it was an actual emergency or something
bad was happening i wouldn't have minded
this i think you don't really know until
that happens though like
so if she had phoned have been like i'm
actively being killed right now
could you help me he would be like oh
gladly
no problem
[Laughter]
i wouldn't mind it but it's more the
fact she knowingly took an extremely
risky walk home when she could have
gotten home a safer way but chose not to
it took me around two hours to sleep
afterwards so i was even more upset
after the phone call it ended
i i mean i could i'm gonna be honest
came into this thinking
could be the
definitely uh
left this feeling like
he's not the in my opinion
be not because
he was justified in getting angry
at being called
and woken up but in my opinion justified
because she didn't
plan for a situation in which she
wouldn't have to call him
that's my take on the subject
i know it seems it seems
subtle
but instead of being like you know
don't call me
unless you're being killed which is kind
of the way it it's phrased i think it's
more like hey
is very inconsiderate of you to well i
don't know because now i'm like
i don't want to go so far as to say she
put herself in a position where she
would need to call him because that's a
little bit up to begin with but
at the same time i am like if if she had
planned better she could have just
gotten home in a more safe manner than
walking home through the darkness for
three quarters of an hour
um
i mean i would be annoyed i guess that's
why i'm i'm putting myself on the
mindset that i would be annoyed too
sleeping issues uh notwithstanding
i i don't even see it as in everybody
sucks here like i'm i'm not even
i'm not even willing to to say that he's
like why would he suck in this situation
i guess from her perspective
it would suck to be like hey i'm scared
and he was like
you didn't plan effectively
to not be scared click right like
that if you're in her
mindset
you you would be like
you know well
i guess you don't care about me
i don't know if he hung up
but still
but i'm also like you know
could you have planned to take a taxi or
something yeah also why is
if you're going to bed at 9pm your
girlfriend's going out clubbing at 3 a.m
look if it happens now and then there'd
be diff opposites attract etc etc but
like that seems like a bad fit
just from the outside looking in i'm not
saying break up because i don't know
anything more about the situation but it
definitely seems like i will you know
you're gonna end up in situations like
this
he had an early appointment no i'm
taking his side i think going to bed at
9 00 pm is is highly based
[Laughter]
although they do seem to be young based
on all this nomenclature i've never
heard of like snap maps snapchats
snap map snapchat
okay i mean i got an dude i'm going down
to the blender i i know i shouldn't be
doing this forever but i mean apparently
i am i'll just be better at the
crosswords am i the for not
shutting up at 4 am in real time
i'm 27 f on my way to meet up with my
family on a trip
since i was in a wedding i couldn't
drive up with them and decided to take a
series of buses to catch up with them
i started at 10 pm and would arrive at 8
am i don't know what you're talking
about i don't understand this this this
is happening live right now it's being
updated every
every 10 minutes
after getting off the first bus we were
dropped at a gas station with a small
waiting room designated for the bus
company when we arrived there was a lady
in her dog sleeping and it sprawled out
so no one else could get in consequently
the rest of us
waited outside at 2 30 a.m for 40
minutes for the next bus to come when it
arrives the lady gets on the bus and
says she missed the last one's been
waiting 15 hours for this new one she
and her dog head to the back at the next
transfer we get by on a smaller bus and
my seat mate starts talking to me i love
practicing spanish so while we were in
the rest area we were chatting as soon
as we start driving dog lady comes up
and says i know you guys were excited to
talk to each other but it's four in the
morning i'm trying to get some sleep
i've been waiting for this bus all day
and i'm tired you need to stop talking
we honestly were not talking loudly but
i guess she needs absolute silence i
politely said that we would need we
would be as quiet as possible but this
was public transportation there's no
rule every passenger had to be silent
she threw a fit and talked to the bus
driver am i the for not going
completely silent i think i might be
because this is the time when people
generally sleep
it's the easiest everybody sucks here of
all time
well actually no you're the
yeah like it is
i feel like they did some sneaky
rhetorical stuff right like you you i
think maybe not everybody agrees with me
but i feel like it's good to be able to
learn how to spot this like you he
she i should say they did identify up
here um
she
left a sentence in here that primed us
there's a small waiting room when we
arrived there was a lady and her dog
sleeping in it sprawled out so no one
else could get in consequently the rest
of us waited outside at 2 30 a.m
this is
contextual
it does provide some preamble
but it also makes us predisposed to uh
not
like she's already the villain in our
story
just as a result of this so we can't
possibly if we read this you know the
first time through we can't possibly
have a fair assessment of uh her
character once the actual buildup starts
happening here
so yeah it's poisoning the well it's a
it's an inconsiderate move to be
sleeping at the front of the door
it does also sound like she was
tired man she said she'd been waiting
uh 15 hours for the next bus
now
ignoring this
i'm
should you be able to
practice your spanish on a bus at 4 a.m
no
you should be
like in prison for like a day
there's there's rules of decorum maybe
unspoken unwritten rules it's the same
thing if you're on an airplane
when the if if you're flying like you
know across the international date line
or you're flying
you know across the prime meridian or
something when they turn the lights off
you shut the up
you can whisper a little bit you know
and people have got headphones on and
stuff like that but even though it's a
it's a public place there's like rules
of
decorum for how you have to interact
with your around when you're around
other people you know i i think that
this happened to me once i i stayed at a
hostel like 10 years ago
and uh
one guy when he woke up in the you know
you're sleeping like six or eight people
to a room just in bunk beds and he he
woke up at like 7 a.m and just started
watching
like soccer clips on youtube with the
computer speakers on
and you're just like what are you
well it's uh hey if you're sharing a
room with other people of course you're
gonna have to deal with noise right hey
why don't you just have noise cancelling
headphones or something like that or
you know it it
there's like it's a situation
i mean is it everyone's like it's public
transportation
it might be i don't know even if it is
public transportation if if there's like
24-hour bus service and you're on a bus
at like 5 a.m and you're having a
conversation at a normal volume you're
kind of an i think
i i hate to say it but you know i've
been a night owl in my life
and even when i was i still had this
opinion
but
you know but between the hours of like
10 p.m and
you know 7 a.m
you just kind of chill that's when the
earth is
as quiet as possible
in order to make sure that everybody
else around you can also do what they
need to do
that's my take on it at least
i think you would it's the same
okay well what if there's a baby crying
on the on the airplane or there's a baby
crying on the bus i'm trying to sleep
okay whatever get some headphones
you it's a public plane
you're on a public plane right now
there's there's 300 people around you
and you expected enough silence for you
to sleep that seems like you're the
no they should make a a plane for babies
only only only an airline for babies
anyway i just wanted an excuse to tell
the hostile story anyway i don't think
everybody sucks well i don't know she
does kind of suck for falling asleep
next to the door
[Laughter]
i that's kind of a move um but
also i feel like carrying on a
conversation 4am on a bus is
you know maybe i'm i have too much of uh
it sounds selfish but it's actually like
the opposite you know because you
they're probably thinking oh it's the
lady's interest
in her not being able to sleep versus
our interest in having a conversation
but if you're annoying one person you're
probably annoying like
most people
it's just that one person had the
the cojones to actually like confront
you and say something whereas everybody
else was like i'll just be mad about it
but i think that uh
you know it's your your desire to have a
conversation in whatever and it's
different depending on the time of day
if it's you know 2 p.m and people work
different shifts but this is just
the unwritten rules of society as i see
it if it's 2pm
and you know you're on a public bus and
you're trying to get some sleep and uh
well it doesn't even seem like a public
bus either it seems like a greyhound
situation which kind of changes things
anyway
if it's 2pm and you're like hey can you
shut up i'm trying to sleep you just
give her the middle finger and say you
know it's a free country if it's a.m
you know your desire to practice your
spanish is very secondary to the people
around you having a peaceful environment
that's my two cents
night planes are for sleeping night
buses are for sleeping
you may disagree with me on this just
download duolingo what you don't have a
phone but you expect her to get noise
cancelling headphones
okay we gotta go to the blender
everybody sucks here on a
blender situation
you guys don't have phones
well you can practice uh spanish at 4am
in your own uh
in your own house because when it's your
own house it's your own rules
so i can wake up somebody for snoring on
a bus if i'm trying to sleep look okay i
know i get it you're a redditor um
there's also there's a spectrum you have
to consider of things that are optional
and things that are not optional okay
things that you have like some control
over things that you don't have control
over if somebody's sleeping they don't
have as much control over the fact that
you're snoring you might choose to just
you know eat on that one and still
try to fall asleep even though they're
snoring if somebody's wide awake and
banging a bunch of crash cymbals
together
they're both disturbing
but one of them is substantially more
ruder and and much more ignorant
it's the same reason
like when a uh when a baby cries you can
be annoyed but you're also like it's a
baby
and when uh
like a 35 year old dude starts just
shouting about politics on the flight
you're like i wish that guy was shut the
 up because we've got the same uh
intellectual capabilities and he's being
a real piece of garbage right now
what song is that i've had it stuck in
my head for a while
i think it's one of the
it's from final fantasy
i think it's i think it's the juno theme
the junon theme yeah see
i don't know why i just popped into my
head so well
i had to think of a march and i was like
yeah yeah final fantasy 7 june on march
okay
hi everybody i was hoping for some input
from this community that i've seen on
all a few times i'm a 39 year old man
and my wife is a 33 year old woman chad
that's not
i know what you're gonna say i
55 year old man and my wife 19 female
that's not that crazy okay
unless they say they've been married for
15 years
she stays at home and takes care of the
house no children yet well i work we're
going on seven years of marriage
last week i received a large performance
bonus and i decided i would like to buy
myself a nice blender with a small
portion of the money i know it's not the
most exciting present to buy yourself
but i cook with a lot of purees and have
a shake every morning i've had two
blenders die on me in the past three
years and was determined to make my life
easier
seeing as it was a financial decision i
told my wife as much and she told me to
show her before i ordered it
very tim robinson type type bit here huh
i know it's not the most exciting
present to buy yourself but i cook with
a lot of purees
okay sorry
i researched a bunch of different models
shopped around checked out safety
checked out safety ratings
is that a common um
you don't you don't hear that much about
blender accidents these days i don't
know if that happens uh
that doesn't mean that they don't happen
i guess just because you don't maybe
they happen so much they don't even
report them in the news because people
are just like ah another blender
accident what else is new water's wet
i found the one i wanted for just under
six hundred dollars i called my wife to
my computer where i showed her the model
that i wanted and was mainly just
confirming she was fine with it she
immediately responded by pointing at the
suggested items list on the website
which showed a significantly cheaper
model she asked what i thought of that
one and i said it wasn't what i was
looking for
i mean that's a pricey blender don't get
me wrong
you got a large performance bonus and
hey hey
the man
he has a a shake every morning
and he cooks a lot with purees
i mean
this seems like a guy if he has if he
literally has a shake every morning and
cooks with purees we're talking about it
he's using it maybe 400 500 times a year
that seems
like you know by the gold standard in
that case
i've used the blender like less than 10
times i think in my whole life
then she said i should get a nice hand
mixer to save some money i kind of
chuckled and said that i didn't really
want one of those
she replied with well how about this
blender it's 500 cheaper than the one
you close i mean the hand mixer is a
joke like does she even know
sounds like she's dabbling in an avenue
that she doesn't she doesn't have gps
coordinates to
you want this guy to make a
a shake with ice cubes in a hand mixer
are you crazy
clearly she doesn't work at bon appetit
i reiterated i was really looking for a
good one that i could use for over a
decade but she was undeterred she
essentially took over my computer then
began the race to the bottom of finding
the cheapest possible blender as i stood
by repeating the same point about being
in the market for a quality product
at one point she went on alibaba showing
me an 11 product that would probably
take a month to ship okay come on
lady that's just you
he he came up with a 600 blender you're
over here on wish.com trying to get the
cheapest the the bargain
i was at my limit so i finally just said
i think about it she left the room and i
ordered the 600 blender based i figured
when the blender got to our house i'd
explain
you know what he should have done is
just been like oh i found this on
alibaba for ten dollars
yeah you wouldn't believe it i just did
a little bit more digging
and then look i found the exact same one
on alibaba for 1 60th of the price
two days later it arrived she asked me
how much it cost
and i said it was the one i'd shown her
she began sulking and said i didn't care
about her opinion to which i responded i
told her i'd think about it then she
asked when i ordered it i responded
about three minutes after she left the
room
it's the
 double g
she left the oh okay i thought about it
in those minutes and made the decision
i'd put half a dozen hours of research
into this is like how my dad buys stuff
he will he'll research like four dining
room chairs for like eight months
just when i when i go
like to my parents house if i'm there
for a week every every day my dad will
be on like uh
overstock.com
furniture
reviews.ca like he he every single
purchase that he makes he he percolates
on it for like at least six months
she's furious with me and keeps
repeating that i has no
it's got to be that she has no financial
power in the house right
she's furious with me now and keeps
repeating that i has no financial i can
has no financial power in the house
i think she's being completely dramatic
but she thinks i'm way out of line any
input on who's right about this would be
great okay two things that i
not the 58 everybody sucks here
20
okay i gotta work on this screen region
i i agree
not the
i definitely don't think it's everybody
sucks here
because the guy is not an but i
will also i i think this is a no
okay what's the percentage on that two
percent
that being said now i'm like
nah she's kind of being an but
she's kind of being an but i i
understand where she's coming from
works from home
doesn't make the money
maybe she she's looking for some kind of
way to exercise a little bit of control
over the you know
financial spending of the household
right she she doesn't have the
based on what is written here it seems
like she doesn't have the means to uh
you know do it herself so maybe she just
wanted to be like hey i'm gonna you know
be part of the blender process
that's dude that's a genius idea
malicious compliance
he should have bought
the 600 blender
and the 11 blender
is my phone falling out of my pocket
again
it would have only cost
11 extra dollars
which is not that much when you're
already spending 600 and then he could
be like look at this i got the
i got the blender you wanted me to get
oh man
genius
yeah and then he could have put the 11
blender
into the 600 blender turned it on
watched it get vaporized and then said
that's why you don't buy an 11 blender
but yeah i don't think i mean this is
just a minor little conflict man this is
not that big of a it's not that big of a
deal let's go see what kind of what the
most insane people on the internet think
about it
i i personally am predicting
uh that there will be some kind of a
comment from someone that's about 16
years old that will be like if she's
like this about a blender imagine what
she's gonna be like when you have
children do you really want that in your
future someone who doesn't respect you
at all
everybody sucks here hope you realize
the fight's much bigger than just about
the blender she feels like she doesn't
have any power i suggest you find a good
marriage counselor and do not have kids
until you figure out if you can resolve
this okay
look
that's not quite the exact comment i
said but
if you've ever had a spat
with your spouse
over something as small as a blender do
not have kids
i think it's a little uh reductive
a little bit of a red flag that you guys
disagree on something everybody sucks
here regardless of whether 600 bucks is
too much to spend you shouldn't have
told her you'd think about it when you'd
already thought about it hey it's just
being polite
you lied to her
when you said all think about it when
you were not intending to think about it
you
he's just being polite
i just two questions does your wife
manage the finance
too does she have access to all the bank
accounts or is she on some kind of
allowance system hey before i weigh in
on this blender argument um
do you give your wife an allowance
what i'm trying to get is what kind of
underlying tensions or resentments there
may be around money she made a
significant statement about feeling
powerless which you dismissed casually
without a second thought
okay i do think that's kind of fair
oh man
people are not being that rude
not the sounds like you bought a
vitamix that's what people in chat were
saying they were like
he could be the unless it's a
vitamix because those things are like
those things will last forever
given your stupid wife pointed out that
you'd get a hand mixer it's quite clear
she has no clue about your blender needs
that is pretty funny also true though i
mean come on a hand mixer
are you stupid
to be fair she didn't care about your
opinion either and disagreeing about an
opinion is not considered not caring
it's called having your own opinion not
the it's your money
not the big financial decisions
should be joint
sure
however you said earlier as a small
performance of your performance a small
portion of your performance budget
personally i think if you're working
hard at your job and get money as a
reward you should be justified in taking
some of that money to treat yourself as
you see fit as long as other expenses
are covered which i assume they are it's
great you asked her opinion she didn't
really okay i mean that's all very
reasonable get to the insanity please
please i'm i'm begging you get to the
unreasonability
i love these info requests they seem so
demanding info
is she a housewife due to it being
something you both wanted out of
marriage something she primarily wanted
something you primarily wanted or a
force of circumstance fact
which bear is best
info does she ever get to spend 600 on a
personal item like this info does she
feel free to spend a bunch of money like
this or do you pressure her to think of
saving money when she wants to make big
purchases
okay this was not as spicy as i thought
it would
especially if he's getting the vitamix
wow
59 upvotes i'm just here to say
i'm just here to know what the actual f
someone does all day
looking after the house get a job add to
the finances and then you get a say in
how they're spent
all right look
info how big is your house
info do you have a pool
in
info is this really relevant to the
situation at hand
i will say i mean if we're using this as
like a bit of a teachable moment like
there was def as like a you know 15 year
old kid
if there was a situation where like the
father went to work and the mom stayed
at home
taking care of the house and also the
kids i definitely had a bias where i was
like oh she's got it easier i'm not
saying that's what i think now i'm
saying that's what i thought when i was
a teenager
now that i have a child and have worked
in some more traditional environments
obviously this is an atypical gig right
here um
i kind of feel like the dad in a lot of
situations gets off easy
you know
when you go to work for it depends on
the job but you know working in an
office
you you know if you're there for eight
hours some days you do like an hour and
a half of work and you're just kind of
chilling
and also looking after the kids is
exhausting you know like we have one
baby
daughter
and sometimes my wife and i will be like
you know hey can you look after
her for 10 minutes i need a break
and then we do with the break is we like
vacuum
[Laughter]
it's not like oh i need a break so i can
like go outside and get some leisure
time it's literally just like please
just give me like a psychological like
tolerance break to return to normalcy
for a bit and then come back with a
fresh mind
no i get that they don't have kids yet
and i i do then look at it and i'm like
you know
i'm not gonna say she doesn't do
anything with their time i'm i'm basing
it all on the marge simpson episode of
uh the simpsons where she starts
drinking a glass of wine a day
as a habit because she's bored with the
house that looks after itself i know the
doctors say you should drink a glass and
a half but i just can't drink that much
but anyway that's not that relevant to
the blender situation man
you think he's really going to be like
oh i'm going to buy whatever blender i
want because you just watched the view
all day that's not a healthy situation
man
i am a stay at home wife so i can answer
i deal with everything around the house
and repair appointments i also mow it
means i deal with dog vet appointments
his one consistent chore is
laundry he wears a uniform and i refuse
to deal with it because of reasons that
i won't list here
i'm not taken aside it does seem like
another thing you might do during the
day is post
a four paragraph reply
on reddit but
it isn't a 40 hour a job week but it's
still a job that needs to get done
that's true that is true
also our dogs are older and one has an
immune issue okay sure we have joint
finances and go over our budget together
you guys should try to stay within your
budget together i thought that was the
point i'm this is punching down get hey
get out of here it's
it's a honey trap for me it's it's i'm
getting too snippy there's no need for
that there's no need for that
okay anyway let's do some crosswords
this was good this was good reacts
it was a vitamix okay



back with the react court it has been
two weeks which is crazy um
there's there's been a lot of uh strife
in the world there's been a lot of
situations right for a little debate on
the internet who's who's in the right
who's in the wrong you know i'm i'm
ready to be back here everyone's saying
you you're the [ __ ] what just because
i took a vacation with my baby am i the
[ __ ] for taking a vacation with my
baby
i don't think so uh our second reacts
court uh of the week here might be
we want plates which i believe
is a subreddit for being served things
in restaurants in bizarre ways like the
the classic example i always think of is
this there was this restaurant in the
bay area that went viral um for the
wrong reasons because they served you
your meal on like an ipad
like uh
on a powered down apple tablet
anyway we'll see um but for now let's
let's just go look through uh am i the
[ __ ] am i the [ __ ] for giving a
girl a ride to a party but not home from
it she said i stranded her
i i do want to say i have no respect
for the post that and this is all of
them that makes it look like
um
there's no way they couldn't be the
[ __ ] and then they're obviously or
there's no way they could be the
anything but the [ __ ] and then
they're clearly actually just being nice
but anyway here we go
am i the [ __ ] for giving a girl a
ride to a party but not home from it
i was going to a friend's afternoon
garden party at her house
tell me um you're part of the one
percent without telling me you're part
of the one percent my plan was to drive
there stay at the party for a while then
afterwards meet up for a date at a
brewery near my friend's house then
potentially stay over at my dates place
which was close to my friend's house or
get an uber home but not drive my car
after i've been drinking this is written
by a streamer
you know how i can tell
no rational person would have raked them
over the coals and assumed that their
plan was drunk driving most rational
people would have given them the benefit
of the doubt but instead
they're baking like every possible bad
faith assumption and counter argument
into the statement so instead of just
being able to say
my plan was to take an uber back they
have to go through all the rationale and
reasoning to be above criticism but
anyway
when i was about to go to the party i
mentioned i'd be driving there and
bringing a car full of firewood in group
chat
a girl who's a friend of a friend asked
me if she could get a ride to the party
she was coming from the same area as me
i said sure we went to the party we
didn't really hang out at the party i
was talking to other friends that night
i left the party leaving my car parked
near my friend's house to go on the date
it went well i went to her house which
was close by for the night quit bragging
man
quit bragging
what i didn't know was the girl i'd
driven to the party was waiting for me
to be ready to leave thinking i was
still at the party and would be driving
home that night she thought that because
we'd come together we'd also leave
together she texted a few times but i
didn't see the texts she was also
looking for me and asking other people
if they'd seen me
but the people she happened to ask
didn't know me well and didn't know that
i'd left can i tell you
right now
this is totally fine just bad
communication she should have asked
don't get me wrong but i i don't think
it's unreasonable
for her to assume that she's also
getting a ride home from the person who
gave her a ride there that's that's just
the communication mishap now i'm
deliberately not reading any further
ahead
do you think
that in the next four paragraphs it's
all gonna fall apart
you don't don't comment if you've read
further ahead but it
so many of these are like 75 of the way
just normal human communication errors
happen all the time then it's she she
told my friend that
she got abandoned at the party and was
forced to sleep in the woods and now
nobody will talk to me anymore
the next morning i saw her text i texted
her back to say sorry i missed her
messages i hadn't been going back that
way last night anyway though she sent me
an upset message saying someone you
don't you don't just give someone a lift
40 minutes from home and then not drive
them home stranding them late at night
you can't push lunch
you just can't
whose bag is this
i almost tripped on it
i said i didn't realize she was also
asking for a lift home then he's like
that'll be 30 bucks and everybody
clapped um i thought when she asked me
for a lift there she literally just
meant a lift to get there if she said
there and back i would have said i
couldn't promise that i wasn't sure i'd
be going back that way she said i was
being deliberately stupid
it honestly didn't occur to me like i
feel it's presumptive to assume am i the
[ __ ] for driving another girl to a
party but not home um
this is
you're the [ __ ] for making this post
and it's the top post um
of am i the [ __ ] filter this week for
for the whole week this is as spicy as
it got
this i don't even think this is an
everybody sucks here i think this is a
no [ __ ] situation but they're both
they both made one critical mistake look
i putting myself in the shoes of the
girl
i i would assume i would definitely also
ask
but i would assume
that it's a package deal
i mean if you're driving like 40 minutes
away there is no point during the 40
minutes where you couldn't have been
like
hey are you coming back as well like or
you know can i also get a drive back and
then you know even if he said no at
least you would then be able to plan
around it but um the fact that they
didn't talk about it over the course of
the entire drive is kind of baffling to
me but i can understand why she would
assume
that she would also be getting a drive
back because i mean when you're going 40
minutes away you you i mean i'm not
saying she's he's beholden to her but
you would assume that maybe like that's
the easiest way the most frictionless
way for it to happen um
but then also from ops perspective i
mean i do think it's a little
stem lordy i i don't know if that's the
terminology i would use given more time
but it's a little stem lordy to be like
well
you merely asked for a ride there
which i
complied with you never said anything
about the ride back and that omission i
will just say you honey you reap what
you sow
that being said they are also right so
i think uh
i i think this is just literally like
look it's no fun if i just say
everybody's okay here who who
who has 51 of the blame for the
situation
the passenger
absolutely in my opinion
is i think it's on the passenger to
control
the to be in control of their own
well-being in that sense you know you
got to figure out like you don't just
go to the air airline counter and be
like one ticket to new york and then
show up at the airport like uh on your
for your return trip that you don't even
have a ticket for
and be like well what the heck i gotta
buy a second ticket now you you gotta
you gotta be in charge of your own
itinerary there but i don't know this
one's honestly just kind of boring if
i'm being straight up with you i think
that yes just the fact that you've
you've posted it is like
i mean i i i just consider it unworthy
of even a post
there's got to be something better how
about this one hold on you i don't know
if you can hear tomorrow beating down my
door
come on well welcome welcome
i don't think that the word
ride implies that it's there and back
i do think that's an that's the
assumption i would make but i don't
think there's an implication there
necessarily
am i the [ __ ]
hold on hold on
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our son
to bring women into our house in the
middle of the night oh no
um
let's see
this one this one definitely seems a
little spicier
arguments are horrific
that's just it i don't know why does it
start like uh like a song by the
national or something
arguments are horrific the arguments
arise regarding our oldest son 25 and
his refusal to adhere to a rule that
neither his long time short-term
temporary etc girlfriends are allowed to
come in our house in the middle of the
night it's a simple rule no girls in our
house without our knowledge in the
middle of the night that is not a simple
rule okay
because i the the first thing i want to
ask is what is the middle of the night
you know
if he's if he's bringing a girlfriend
over
at like
8 30 and you go to bed at eight like
what are you supposed to do
if if it's like three a.m
then we can start to talk but like okay
let's take a look tomo i i love you man
i love you
could you could you just back it up a
little bit just back it up
unfortunately our 25 year old son can he
continues to flaunt his our sexy hunk
son continues to flaunt this rule hey
mom and dad
i'm not just gonna bang this girl in the
bushes like you want i'm gonna go home
to my my safe warm bed
instead of finding a porta potty
somewhere
we have outdoor security cameras and we
are able to see him sneak his
girlfriends he keeps using etc i don't
know
i don't know why he's being so weird
about it
able to see him sneak his girlfriends
etc in and out of the house at all hours
of the night
as background this issue came ahead a
number of years ago we told our son his
longtime girlfriend could no longer come
upstairs after 10 p.m where we have our
family bedrooms two days after we
implemented this rule he was caught
breaking it he did it again a few years
later honest question dude are you
stupid
so the only interpretation that i think
it's possible to glean from this is that
the the son's bedroom is also upstairs
right
so they sleep on the same floor
but his girlfriend is not allowed
to also
come upstairs into his bedroom
after
uh after dark hold on this cat man
i love you tomo but why why do you want
the pets right now buddy oh just go into
the box there you go
oh and now he's gone
he's like i want some more
um
this is insane like this is is in my
opinion kind of almost an insane rule to
have for like uh
i mean i don't want to get too into the
issue i guess but even for like uh
you know a teenage child
to be like you're you know you can't
have your
your boyfriend or girlfriend upstairs
after 10
but uh a 25 year old is is well beyond
kind of the the bounds of absurdity
since then there are numerous
instances of girls we know and girls we
don't know that come and go into our
home in all hours of the night the
latest occurred with this long-term
girlfriend
being snuck into the house at 5 30 and
leaving before the house awakened the
security cameras caught them purposely
trying to be avoided
i i feel like i need to raise another
concern here uh which is if the only way
you can notice this stuff happening is
on the security cameras and no crimes
are being committed then who cares
[Laughter]
if if your 25 year old son snuck his
girlfriend in at 5 30 for like an hour
and a half and you only notice later
that day when you
poured over the security footage like a
psycho then then what's the big deal
my wife and i decided that even though
he was 25 he would have a curfew from 12
a.m to 7 a.m where by the way this is
not the [ __ ] is the is the flare here
i'm dying my wife and i decided that
even though he's 25 he would have a
curfew from 12am to 7am whereby he
either had to be home by midnight and
stay home or had to stay out until the
next morning
in addition to brining
that's not cool in addition to bringing
his girlfriends into the home it's very
disruptive when he's constantly coming
in and out at all hours of the night
look i can
uh
accept that it would be annoying to hear
someone entering and leaving your home
at all hours of the night i can actually
i can relate to and understand that but
you do also
have uh
a child like a an adult child living
with you
i feel like there's an element of like
that's kind of just life
like you can't mandate somebody's life
to the extent that they literally never
inconvenience you i think you
just have to accept that when you live
with other people especially when
they're family i mean you you could be
like hey keep it down but you can't be
like a uh you can't leave the house
between 12 a.m and 7 a.m
anyway my wife communicated
oh this curfew was a means to address
these issues and was created jointly
between my wife and i both both of the
parties involved
me and my wife who side on the same
issue and also i it's all my wife is
always capitalized which is truly
hilarious but um didn't even ask the
child okay my wife communicated this
curfew to him two days ago i refuse to
speak to him because he's bigger and
stronger than me um last night he came
home at 1 50 a.m i i didn't even talk
about the fact that
like and again i i am closer to the
son's age than the parents presumably i
hope um although the father does kind of
sound like a little kid
i don't you really want to have a a
curfew 12 a.m to 7 a.m so if your son
can't come home
by if he's like oh the uber's gonna get
me there at 12 30
then he's like i guess i'm just gonna go
sleep on the street like
that's not the
really good parenting in my world
it's like how how about like it's always
you know you've always got a safe place
here but please you know
be respectful i know it's like a perfect
world situation but
i'm just saying anyway
last night he came home at 1 50 a.m two
days after the new rule it was broken
he did call my wife to ask if he could
come home late and she agreed
so it sounds like he actually didn't
really break the rule it sounds like he
got uh
he got permission to break the rule
actually i told her that i was shocked
he would have the nerve to even ask two
days after breaking our only real rule
except for the other rule
this resulted in another huge argument
in that i feel like the lack of
retribution is the root cause of why he
keeps breaking the rule why wouldn't he
keep breaking the rule the only thing
that happens is my wife and i fight as a
result
the this guy's actually like my son hat
we've got to remove the safety net and
let my son hit rock bottom
this destructive habit of coming home
after midnight
and sleeping with his girlfriend in his
own bedroom is too much he's going down
a bad path
i feel it is fair and reasonable to not
allow our 25 year old son to bring his
girls to our home in the middle of the
night and while my wife agrees this
continues to happen and be a source of
arguments her perspective is that i have
it in for him and my perspective is
simple just show us the necessary
respect by doing exactly what i say at
all times and follow this pretty obvious
rule and also the other obvious rule i'm
being called the [ __ ] because i won't
let this issue go and it's a recurring
source of arguments as i feel as a lack
of respect which is fundamental and
shouldn't be let go how about the lack
of respect that you've got uh for your
adult son who was probably like the age
that you were when you had him in the
first place
my wife thinks i'm the [ __ ] for not
letting the issue go and for not waiting
until he eventually moves out i'm okay
i am dying
not the [ __ ] hold on you you can't
see
but i'm being completely sincere not the
[ __ ]
63
what
everybody sucks here 16
which i have to be honest i don't fully
agree with
you're the [ __ ] 10
i already know what the comments are
going to be but i am going to read them
you know as well as i do what it's going
to be we'll say it on three three two
one your house your rules even if you
told him he had the strip naked when he
comes in and get de-loused you know even
though he's an adult within a with
autonomy and you should have your son's
best interest in mind and you know etc
etc um if you pay the mortgage then
legally it's not you know you're the
jurisdiction you're the warden of the
prison et cetera et cetera
let's uh let's let's see what they say
here
oh yeah also maybe a little jealousy
because it sounds like the sun is just
laying pipe 24 7.
you know what not the [ __ ]
that
serves him right if you're gonna [ __ ]
you're gonna [ __ ] in the daytime mister
freaking
sexy hunk hold on i'm trying to figure
out how to open this post
how do you how do you open a post man oh
there we go i got it all right
um
okay let's let's learn together okay
hey i'm all for different perspectives
man let's see let's see what we get
not the [ __ ] but you need to enforce
these rules hold on
tell me more about this part
not the [ __ ] but you need to enforce
these rules you either need to start
being a boner killer and banging on his
bedroom door when he brings these women
home uh but that you that would require
the father to wake up when it actually
happens instead of merely pouring over
the security footage like a [ __ ]
psycho the next day or you can put an
extra set of deadbolts on the door that
get locked at midnight and unlocked at
7am holy crap you guys are insane
anybody else lock their son out of their
house because i don't like when he stays
out a little bit late i don't get me
wrong like
someone coming home at 4 00 a.m like if
i woke up would be annoying for me
coming home at like 12 30 i would be
like he's 25.
he's 25 years old
also you should tell your wife that your
son is never actually gonna move out
how would you know this
at all you'd
why bother when he can do whatever he
wants whenever he wants with no
consequences and have someone to keep
the house clean are you do you this this
has to be an alt for
the op it's the only
i
i'm not even gonna get into the
economics of whatever just like
do you think the kid really like if he
had options he would be like oh i really
i love living at home and getting
harassed by my dad for like going to bed
at 1am even though i'm an adult um
i'm also i don't know if this was like
edited or something but
the kid's 25 years old has no job
accused his dad of having it out for him
when he was told to get a job and pays
no rent like none of that is actually
located in the post maybe that was
edited later i don't know
it sounds like he made that up
op at some point you need to kick him
out
just hold on just
everybody sucks here your son is the
[ __ ] for not respecting the rules of
your house however you and your wife are
as well for allowing it to continue for
so long i am
i am dying
that
there is
only two parent comments in here but i
am dying that nobody has said your rules
are have
are ridiculous and have gone too far and
instead everybody else is just like
you're the [ __ ] for not enforcing
your totally sensible rules
not the [ __ ] why are you coddling a
man in his mid-20s by allowing him to
sleep in his bedroom uh when he pleases
and apparently doesn't even
like wake you up you got to see the
security footage after
i got the impression this is more about
them not wanting to be awoken by the
sound of ham slaps more than trying to
coddle their son
so good
damn slaps
not the [ __ ] it's not his house it's
yours if he wants to do whatever he
wants then he could just buy his own he
can just buy his own house he's the
[ __ ] not you he's being disrespectful
by not listening to you
holy crap man this is this is crazy yeah
i don't know why and i i don't think
this is i always default to the idea
that it's like an american thing and i
don't think that's fair
i'm just realizing homeowners have lost
their mind
as as one myself
i'm like look
i don't even make the rules in my own
house so maybe this is
this is just power for the course for me
to be a little bit lackadaisical about
it but i'm like when you have
like a kid
like you can say your house your rules
but at the same time like i feel like
the kind of parental love you have for
your son
has to
you know make it a little bit more
accommodating for that as well
oh my god
i'm baffled by him bringing home randoms
at all hours i moved back home at 26
after leaving an abusive relationship
and then stayed because my mom was
diagnosed with cancer and yet i it's
gonna be like i did whatever i i did
whatever they told me at all times
my parents knew i didn't have to be
there but i stayed to help we had one
rule if you're not going to be home by
the time we wake up text us so we won't
worry that's a good rule
that's actually a fantastic rule
if you're gonna be out late send us a
text that's like
i'll be home late don't stay up just go
to bed rather than wait
if i had sex i usually had it somewhere
else okay there were sometimes i had it
at home which completely invalidates the
point i was gonna make but usually i
followed the rule
usually i played by the standards that
i'm forcing on this stranger there were
times my boyfriend stayed with me when
my parents had gone
and i would never ever disrespect my
parents by having sex in their home
while they were there
is that an is this a rule as well that
i'm not the this is why you need uh a
notary public
you know if you pay the mortgage you're
the only person legally allowed to [ __ ]
in that house
please do not let the landlords figure
this out because it's going to be
written as a clause in the every lease
you're you really trying to [ __ ] in the
garage that i converted into an illegal
suite
no ham slabs allowed honey
this is insane i would never disrespect
my parents
by having sex in their home
comma while they were there
when they weren't there it was open
season man
24 7
certified freak
not the [ __ ] but isn't it a little
late to demand respect from your 25 year
old since he violates your rules every
chance he gets
do people i i can't believe i'm spending
like half an hour just on this one
specific post but it's the first am i
the [ __ ] post i've ever seen where i
disagree so much with the consensus
like this is this one's blowing me away
i think you gotta realize like there's
two
um reasons that someone might break your
rule okay
one of the rules is
uh one of the reasons someone might
break your rule is because they don't
have respect the other one might be that
your rule just is stupid
like
your rule might just actually suck and
you've designed it in such a way that
there's essentially no way to comply
with it
you know if you made a rule that was
like no eating
and then someone was like hey you know
12 hours later he was breaking it he
couldn't even make it a month
i mean it's
anyway
not the [ __ ] okay your house your
rules when he has a place he pays for he
can have his own rules sounds like he
needs a job and an apartment
thanks the come catcher
i do find this part weird or he had to
stay out until the next morning i'd
rather have my kid home if he's got
nowhere else to go like what's the point
of that what's the desired effect by the
way you're not the [ __ ] your house
your rules
if he wants to if he wants to break the
rules he can get his own [ __ ]
apartment he can pull himself up by his
bootstraps by the way this one part of
your post specifically i think makes you
an [ __ ] not the [ __ ] by the way
you're not an [ __ ] but
i agree with you a hundred percent
except for this one specific part that i
think makes you an [ __ ] but you're
not the [ __ ] okay hold on hold on
what's the point of this rule to not
affect people when they're sleep
it's very rude to come walking into
someone's home
someone in this case by the way being
your parents your life givers
um that late unless it was mentioned
beforehand plus he is 25 not 15
wherever he is he can stay until seven
i'm 21 my parents have the same rules
for me college student and doesn't pay
any bills
the self report at the end
not the [ __ ] and there's one solution
for this kick your son out of your house
that's that's the reading between the
lines not the [ __ ] even ordinary
roommates typically make agreements
about when and how often dates can be in
the house
look first year university first time i
ever lived with a roommate never
broached the conversation at all my
roommate had his girlfriend
come from out of the city to stay with
us our dorm room had two single beds
i was like as long as she sleeps in your
bed i'm not sweating it
big whoop
you know it's just assumed that you
you know it's
it's an accommodation you make when you
live with other people
second year university i lived with
seven uh well six other people never had
this conversation about you know
romantically who's allowed to come over
and how often
now were there some times maybe
in in third year where uh we were like
hey one of our housemates girlfriends
basically lives with us and yet he's
paying the normal amount of the utility
uh
share and as a result maybe he should be
paying you know two eighths instead of
one seventh we did we did consider that
at times however that's not that big of
a deal that's like a twenty dollar a
month difference probably overall
apart from that and we we
nobody really cared it was it was not
mouth we did i didn't ever live with
mouth
plus malf is very respectful info is he
paying rent hi he does not pay rent or
any house bills okay so this is where
some of the info came from
he's 25 years old kick him out this is
you're gonna make me cyber bully man
this is where you then go into their
post history and figure out what what
else they're posting
if they ever posted anything about the
economy being [ __ ] up or like minimum
wage being too low that's where you go
into the post history and you're like oh
really because you're advocating for
someone who's 25 years old to get kicked
out of their parents house just because
you're jealous that they're laying pipe
constantly
everybody's okay we finally found a post
that maybe we can find some common
ground with everybody sucks here you
can't give a 25 year old man a curfew
that's ridiculous we have found a human
being
that lives in
the real world at least
a little bit
you definitely cannot give a 25 year old
man a curfew if he's gonna live with you
then he needs to pay rent maybe okay
like it look you buy yourself some some
honey with this i don't necessarily
agree with that but it depends on the
situation i guess
at that point okay sure if he pays rent
then his visitors are his business
that's fair if he's waking you up and
causing a disturbance that's one thing
but you fixating on this rule is masking
the real problem this is very true
he's acting like a teenager and you're
treating him like one this is an
unhealthy cycle tell him he has one
month to get his act together and start
paying rent or move out you should make
him move into the basement room either
way to give you all some space this uh
honestly
this has made me a little bit
a little bit more amenable to that side
i do underst he has a little bit more
ability to say
he can do what he wants if he pays some
rent for sure i'm not saying he should
have to make
have to pay rent i also think that
forcing your 25 year old son to vacate
his bedroom to go live in the basement
is just it it's always a weird like
power flex right like it's like a prison
warden inmate situation
dude i'm dying of this stuff not the
[ __ ] it's your home your rules you
make the rules if he wants to make the
rules he needs his own place he needs to
grow grown up or and gtfo
of your house he's acting like a baby
i'm surprised oh oh woman
the air quotes don't even make any sense
would even date someone oh you know what
because here's what he's saying
any any
woman that would date somebody who
doesn't respect his father's curfew is
not a woman they're merely a girl
i understand that's what he's saying
there
by the way he's getting super entitled
and that isn't gonna change source dude
just trust me you should give him a
60-day notice to evict this will help
him grow up i know it works from
experience
a post that i read on the turning point
usa forums
holy [ __ ]
it's his home too minus 13 votes
[Laughter]
oh
no it isn't he doesn't even pay rent or
help with the bills
besides there's a pandemic bringing
strangers home is dangerous but not
between the hours of 7 a.m and midnight
that's when the virus sleeps
oh man what a what a post i mean i'm
that one
i got a lot of a lot of meat out of that
one
oh we finally have our first [ __ ]
post
oh no come on man
come on this one there's no way
yeah
am i the [ __ ] filter doesn't have it
only allows uh the judgment bot to
collate the results it doesn't show the
like people there don't talk about the
their reaction to it
am i the [ __ ] for assigning my family
homework and not visiting until it's
done
i recently quit my phd program to get a
job because i realized academia was not
what i wanted and i was better off just
using my master's to get a job everyone
i know from school
or has experience with grad school
agreed i'm doing the right thing because
i've only done one year of phd classes
so it's a good time to quit i've had
people tell me they wish they'd quit at
my level but they feel trapped now
because they're well into their
dissertations my family were not
understanding none of them have ever
been to grad school but they believe
that i was very far along and quitting
at the last minute
for context how long is a phd a a phd is
like another
it's four four plus years right
four to six years four to eight years
average length five to seven years okay
so so he quit like 20 it wasn't like he
was a year away so he was like at most
maybe like 25 percent of the way there
okay
um that that seems reasonable if you
decide it's not what you'd want to do at
the moment um
i told them one year of classes by the
uh no i'm not even gonna go there i was
gonna say maybe it matters more what
what they're doing but let's not even
get into that um
they believe i was very far along and
quitting at the last minute i told them
one year of classes is nothing but they
don't realize how hard the exam and
dissertation are uh i think i could get
them done they think i could get them
done if i just spent a little bit more
time i figured they wouldn't listen to
me but they might listen to someone else
i found an article written by a college
professor that describes what it's like
to get a phd in my field i told them i
would not visit until they read the
article and wrote a few paragraphs
summarizing the article and discussing
why someone would not choose to get
their phd hey um you know you ever hear
someone say that you can be very
accomplished in academics and still be
pretty dumb
i've been there
uh
look just finish the post before we
before we go off i guess there there
could be something to ameliorate this
um
it's not meant to be a long and
difficult project i just wanted them to
understand my point of view
one thing you need to know about human
beings is they love being assigned
homework especially uh like from their
child
and also
being railroaded into an
ultimatum uh where they your child
literally won't visit you until you
watch this anyway
my boyfriend and siblings did their
essays did their essays
and apologized and my boyfriend went
above and beyond by including other
sources besides the article that's
probably because you're dating another
nerd like yourself dummy
that's all you've been you've been in
school for
24 years you're 26 years old all you
know how to do is write essays he was
probably he probably got a big old nerd
boner for it
who who would have thought that your
boyfriend would you know
acquiesce to your ridiculous ultimatum
what what a ridiculous
what a surprise
um
my parents still haven't done their
essays and haven't apologized and still
complained that i'm throwing away all
the work i did am i the [ __ ] for
standing my ground and not visiting
until they do their homework
this is a a classic example of um
not such a horrible
idea but an absolutely disastrous
execution
[Laughter]
you're the [ __ ] but slightly based
yeah i would i would agree with that
um
they're they're
look okay so now this is the part of the
discourse where i then get myself into
trouble one thing i do want to know and
i i imagine that it's not the case
but are
the parents
did the parents pay for the education up
to this point that doesn't give them
ownership over what the child does with
their life but if the parents pay for
the first year of the phd program and
then i guess many phd programs are like
scholarship driven maybe i don't know
but
then i could understand why they might
be like hey you're quitting in a
situation
phds are usually funded okay well then
then disregard um
that that's fair enough but i could see
why in that case they might be like
you know we got to give this more
thought you also
like
the
are your parents maybe not seeing it
your way yeah but you said it yourself
like they never they've never been to
grad school you know like for
a large swath of the population perhaps
even myself included uh
the idea in your head is just like the
more school you go to the better your
job is at the end where i think the way
it actually works in some disciplines is
that if you get your phd you're kind of
gated into the academic pipeline
uh and if you just stick with your
masters i don't know maybe you could
work in like private industry or
something related in that sense so there
might also just be like a difference in
you know career path based on them but
your parents might not be aware of that
if they haven't been to grad school lord
knows i'm i'm barely aware of it and i i
didn't go to grad school but you know
many of my friends have their master's
degrees so i think i'm able to to chime
in here
um
i guess it depends on the field that's
fair but uh
you
the reason you're the [ __ ] is because
look if you're if if you're a parent you
might not want to hear this but part of
being
a
kid
is being annoyed by your parents now and
then
because they have a different
perspective on issues than you do and
you talk about it because you know if
you're trying to be a happy family
you just tolerate it because you
probably annoy the [ __ ] out of them in
other ways
like every time i talk to my mom
she's like have you have you guys gotten
your wills done yet and i'm always like
no and then she always like admonishes
me
and in my head i'm like we're [ __ ]
busy like all the time
it's like i know it's good to get done
it's on the list but it's one of those
things that's like important but not
urgent hopefully
um
so every time she she talks to me like i
can't believe like you lazy bones aren't
getting your wheels done
um and it's more for me i'm like every
single day we're like clawing and
scrapping for like 15 minutes of free
time right
um
but then simultaneously i also remember
that like you know when i was in college
i was probably annoying the crap out of
my mom
you know or even sometimes now she'll be
like hey if i'm driving somewhere she'll
be like you know like if we would go on
vacation last week she's like text me
when you get there and then like
seven hours later she's like oh did you
get there and i'm like oh yeah sorry i
forgot
so you know like you you you take the
good and the bad but you have
conversations about it
what i what i would be very upset with i
would probably get over it like pretty
quick but if my mom was like hey i'm not
gonna talk to you again until you watch
this 15-minute video about why it's
important to have a will and then like
write me a summary uh
of the video so that i know that you
watched it i would like that would put a
strain on our relationship i would find
it very disrespectful
and that's from
my parent down the child up is i think
even more of an uphill battle to some
extent even though they're an adult you
know they're probably not used to the
relationship going in that direction
right um
so yeah i would say you're the [ __ ]
um
i mean you could
link them the video
and be like hey
i would if you want to know where i
stand with this phd stuff this video
would help me like you know
under th this would help you come to an
understanding with me maybe and but in
or watch it with them or something like
that but instead
um you know being like i will not visit
you until you've done it i'm like whoa
geez somebody thinks she's super
important oh they're not going to come
over and ask me for money for six months
so that's going to be so hard for me
it's not fair you miss your kid don't
get me wrong but like i mean as long as
you're trying to bring a power dynamic
into this situation for no reason then
you know be careful is i guess what i'm
trying to say
anyway let's see
you're the [ __ ]
but i love you for it
i think that's fair
and this this is a joke tell them they
should apply themselves more and stick
with that's a joke i can laugh about
that i'm not humorless
everybody sucks here they may be
naive and are being rude about it but
you sound insufferable i wouldn't do an
assignment because someone in my family
demanded it and i actually like reading
and writing yes absolutely
i agree this is funny as hell everybody
sucks here
everybody sucks here
assigning homework is juvenile yeah okay
look people this is what me because in
the last post i was like holy crap
i'm uh
i'm not clued into the rest of society
even though chad agreed with me for the
most part
um this one i'm like the reactions are
completely correct you'd think if if i
you i guess it just goes to show
everybody's got an opinion that they're
aberrant on i guess
not the [ __ ] clever way
i i definitely when i think about the
way that i interact with my parents i i
really want clevver to be like the first
word that comes to mind not the [ __ ]
clever way to flip the script on them
that way if they can't write a few
paragraphs they have no right to lecture
you af about dropping out of a second
graduate degree do they have three
degrees no tell them to shut it
hey mom
shut it owned owned and then my mom
handed me a crisp one hundred dollar
bill
a master's is nothing to sneeze at well
it's good to see things through if the
end result is desirable so many people
wind up in debt with degrees they never
use simply because that's what's
expected of them the never quit attitude
hurts everyone sure okay
none of that was included in the uh
original post but go off i guess
this is a classic online debate
technique i think which is uh
write something that's unrelated but
true at the bottom of your post to make
the rest of your posts appear that much
more credible
comment deleted by user
worst advice i have ever read
what did they say something to the
effect of sometimes family members say
inappropriate things it's part of being
a family you have to accept it
oh no that's that was my literal point
thanks for telling me and i agree with
you that is utter [ __ ] if anything
family should be held to higher
standards than other people
okay
enjoy uh exclusively uh arguing with
your parents uh for the rest of your
life if they do anything that isn't
exactly what you want them to do
being inconvenienced or irked by other
people is utter [ __ ]
i never do that to other people other
people are always enamored with my inane
conversations about 45 minutes of do you
see that tweet that was like uh
women and this is not my tweet so don't
get mad it it was like i will literally
give my boyfriend a 45 minute preamble
just to talk [ __ ] about somebody for
five seconds
this is
for me the embodiment of that
they think that everyone's so enamored
with their conversations at all times
maybe i'm projecting not the [ __ ] if
they'd apologized at least then might
say yes if they'd done anything to
indicate they get there wrong i might
say yes okay don't leave me hanging
geez could you could we get some updates
so that annual contract 115 can finally
weigh in on this situation
we're all hanging with the thread about
waiting to see where annual contract 115
falls on this issue
not the [ __ ] hard not the [ __ ]
one thing i notice about older people
not the [ __ ] one thing i've noticed
in my
in my anecdotal evidence about old
people is they're convinced they've
already experienced our hardships my
parents come from an era where [ __ ]
costs next to nothing and both have
hired help to do their laundry cook and
whatnot getting a degree is easy as hell
feels nowhere near as advanced
hardest part is getting into university
after that they just go to the discos
every single day when i showed them my
schoolwork they never bugged me about
being dumb or slow ever again
are you okay
do you need the
like look
everybody likes to talk about themselves
three words two of which are duplicates
about the post they're replying to
and then just the
entire paragraph about needing a friend
really
and just being really rude to their
parents which admittedly maybe they
deserve some degree of rudeness but like
i don't even know him man
you're asking me to kind of
meet you there in the middle i don't
they might be they might be nice people
okay
everybody sucks here your family is not
supporting you and that's idiotic okay
that's fair
however assigning them homework with
summaries do what kind of passive
aggressive [ __ ] is that you could
send them the article tell them why it's
important to you and what you took away
from it but making them do a book report
makes you an [ __ ] too yes i could i
couldn't agree more quite frankly
that's there we go we finally grandpa
joe sloth the certified proctologist
there we go
i don't get why everyone thinks you went
too far as signing the essay your family
were trying to make you do years of
study
were they though like based on the post
or were they just like
dropping out as a major decision or
don't even call it dropping out but
you know
abstaining from completing it were they
trying to make you do years of study and
write a whole ass academic thesis or
were they just like are you sure you
want to do that a one-page essay on a
single article about why you're being
unreasonable is hardly anything by
comparison and hilariously apt not the
[ __ ] why are so many posters
uh so into the idea of owning their
parents
that's when i flipped the script on my
father who
you know was a great male role model for
me for the entirety of my high school
career
what's up with people acting like
writing a couple paragraphs is so hard
it's nuts
always forget when you go three posts
down and
anytime you have to click read more
comments you're about to read some of
the most insane [ __ ] that's ever been
written we we gotta not do that ever
again uh okay let's let's throw the
slash marker in here real quick
oh
so many people are so
concerned about you know being the top
dog in their family so



is monday morning
literally barely but literally welcome
to uh reacts court we're gonna be
looking at are am i the [ __ ] filtered
i just realized like the oh and am i the
[ __ ] you can't see the art blessed
uh for you but it's actually meant to be
like a puckered butthole anyway by the
way this episode is sponsored by azure
automate machine learning to increase
developer productivity with azure get
started with 12 months of free services
use code hardcore history
for your free audiobook download am i
the [ __ ] for wanting my girlfriend to
work out more than just legs
apparently they've already spoken for us
here let's see
me and my girlfriend by the way can i
just i like to judge by the headlines to
begin with okay the
are you an [ __ ] for wanting your
girlfriend to work out more than just
legs
not necessarily i mean i feel like you
could have someone's best interest in
mind and want them to work out more than
you know just one muscle group
but
i i have a feeling that there's some
weirdo energy coming off of this let's
see
hey fishy hat
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
it's not gonna buy you influence in
react court but i appreciate it
me and my girlfriend of two years
regularly go to the gym she started
recently and she seems to only do leg
workouts and we barely interact with
each other at the gym because i like to
work on my whole body
who cares so the other day i asked if
she wanted to work out with me so we can
have the same workout routine that's
when she replied with i don't want to as
she continues her only legs workout
program
i'm already interrupting myself i
apologize you're at the gym
who cares
wait we don't you don't work out
together you go to the gym together
you're not you know joined at the hip
you can spend time apart for like an
hour or 90 minutes or whatever and then
just meet and you know get a smoothie
and go home or something like i don't
understand why you got to be in the
exact
exact same area the gym non-stop but
anyway
i tried to name some benefits of working
the entire body by saying you'll see
progress on your legs way faster if you
include your upper body so your legs
have time to recover and rest i know she
wants to be in her peak physique but she
thinks peak physique only means having a
big butt i personally care more about
her other muscles improving such as her
chest and back now i don't mind her body
right now as that's the body i fell in
love with but i just wish she didn't
take the advice the wrong way is this
guy stupid
[Laughter]
i just don't understand
look i
this is what happens and and i've kind
of been there i haven't been there for a
while but uh
you know when you when you get into
lifting if you get semi-serious into it
you stop uh using your normal brain and
instead the first thing you think of
when you see people is like oh man look
at like the striations on their deltoids
that's crazy
oh my god look at like you can actually
see like the separation between the
different muscles on their on their
shoulder blades like that's insane so
like instead of just letting your
girlfriend you know
build up a
a legendary dumpy what are you what are
you talking about when you say i'm more
concerned with like the muscles in her
chest and her back
i don't mean to be rude like it's it's i
actually agree philosophically
it it makes sense to work out your whole
body but to to get so
anal about it if you'll forgive the word
play just seems a little bit
seems a little bit silly and instead you
you're like dude
i know you're probably going to other
forums and you're like dude chicks are
so stupid they don't even care about
their lat spread but like in the real
world you you messed up you messed up in
a big way
i feel like there's no convincing her
without putting it in her head that
she's not good enough which she 100 is
in my eyes are you you're so you're like
a psychopath
there's no way am i the [ __ ] for uh
coming up with the idea to psychically
manipulate my girlfriend to get her to
work out her chest
i haven't spoken about it since that day
because she seemed super irritated when
i gave her reasons to work out with me
a broken watch is right twice a day
am i the [ __ ] for giving her advice
and wanting her to work her full body
this is something that comes up in
almost every am i the [ __ ] post where
op is an [ __ ]
is
the story here
does not lead to the conclusion
logically speaking
there's so many details here
that like if you just had the sentence
oh i guess i'm a [ __ ] because i want
you to have healthy muscles all over
your body no you're maybe
i mean i don't even know if you're a
[ __ ] here so far i just think you
got a little bit of a weirdo energy
um and maybe you've taken the gym pill a
little bit too much rather than caring
about your relationship but this is also
the [ __ ] classic which is uh
you know you're the [ __ ] if you've
made five edits to try to clarify or
fight back
edit i think some of you
are misinterpreting what i meant which
is your fault i didn't constantly tell
her to work out her full body i only
gave her simple advice that i would take
from somebody else because i was afraid
of being by myself in the gym we only
had one conversation about it and i left
it at that ever since also when i say
she started recently i mean she started
at the beginning of the year hey that's
the eight months ago
that's not like
i thought it was like a month ago she's
been doing this for eight months no
wonder she's taken uh a little bit more
offense because on top of being
you know maybe advice she didn't want to
hear in the first place she's also got
her own expertise to some extent i'm
nothing but proud of her and her
accomplishments except for this one
thing that led me to make this post this
conversation only happened once
you've mentioned that for those who keep
using the words keep on also does it
help that i was having this convo with a
smile on my face
low
final edit thanks for the feedback i
didn't expect so many comments just a
heads up me and my girlfriend are
extremely
loud and incredibly close and the topic
wasn't as harsh as you guys think it was
a one-and-done convo she was irritated
at the moment but brush it off legs for
days exclamation mark exclamation mark
exclamation mark so the moral of you
guys's feedback is don't give
unsolicited advice i'll keep that duly
noted
girlfriend only works out legs and oh
this is the tldr
this is i mean
look i the energy radiating off of the
post i'm not a huge fan of i'm realizing
now though this is pretty low-key like
this is i'm i you know what the problem
was i wasn't on top post of the week
this is top posts of the day
so we're actually you know this is like
a this is like a a spark and we're
looking for a raging inferno so let me
go top posts of of this week
wow loki
and you know as soon as we got our warm
up out of the way here's the inferno
okay
am i the [ __ ] for not allowing my
employees to keep tampons or pads in our
bathroom at work
i'm just eager to see what the result
could possibly be or like what the
reason could possibly be
i've gotta know
why you would say no
please tell me
it's not
period gross
little background
i manage it oh okay so you're not even
the owner but like let's not go there
yet oh my god there's so many edits holy
crap okay
little background i manage a retail
store for a relatively smallish company
it's only got 70 or so locations i
currently have two female employees on
my staff in their earlier mid-20s i am a
male in my early 30s yesterday i found a
box of tampons
in the bathroom at our store our store
only has one bathroom so by default it
is also our customer accessible bathroom
some of our stores just by nature of
whatever the building was used for
before we bought them also have employee
bathrooms but ours only has one single
person bathroom that is on the sales
floor one of my female employees had
left them in the bathroom
i informed her that while there's
nothing wrong with keeping feminine
hygiene products at the i've got no
problem
in principle
with feminine hygiene products being
left in the bathroom but i'm just not
sure it's a great fit for our bathroom
personally
she said uh wait they would need to be
kept in the office and could not be kept
in the bathroom
she said that she thought that was
sexist
i told her that it has nothing to do
with the fact that it's a feminine
hygiene product but because it's a
personal use product we don't want to
have kept in the bathroom available to
our customers and that if a male or
female employee wanted to keep a razor
toothbrush deodorant in the bathroom
that would be prohibited as well she
said that's not the same thing as those
are all personal use products everyone
uses not just women okay here's where i
get myself into trouble okay
i
you know how i came across at the start
of this okay
[Laughter]
i thought it was an employee's only
bathroom
especially i thought you know
that it was a women's bathroom and as a
result having that stuff in there makes
perfect sense
if it's
a bathroom that's also used by customers
i don't care sincerely if i walk into a
bathroom and it's just covered in
anything
if i gotta go i gotta go i don't mind um
i i think the argument to analogy about
it being the same as like a toothbrush
or deodorant is a little bit different
like you know it's not like your armpits
start leaking
blood uh if you don't have the tools
necessary to to handle them in the
moment uh
but i can at least it's not as bad
as i originally thought which was that
this manager was like please don't
change
you know your your feminine hygiene
products inside of the women's bathroom
tweet from nl i would like to apologize
for my words twit longer link
anyway i'm just saying it's not as
much
of as holy as he's not
overstepping his bounds to the same
extent i would think that i originally
thought it would be
my other female employee understands
this policy doesn't see anything wrong
with it the male employees aren't really
relevant to the situation but i would
wager that they agree that's not really
um
a data point that you can
use i think
[Laughter]
can you can you do that i haven't asked
them their opinion but i would wager
that they probably agree also like who
cares
um and i yeah putting myself in the
shoes of uh of a male employee i think i
absolutely would not care at all i would
be i just put it in there man
doesn't bother me
i haven't discussed them with it because
it doesn't seem relevant the upset
female employee however finds it to be
sexist and wants to discuss it with hr
which i told her i would be more than
happy to facilitate a conversation with
concerning this
while this is not a documented company
policy i feel as though it's common
sense to not keep personal hygiene
products in a place customers will be
and that hr will agree i don't think so
i
i mean
i think it's possible that hr might
agree but i don't think that means that
hr is right i mean i think that just
means that
hr is is trying to do absolutely
anything that
could minimize the odds of like a
batshit insane liability or like some
kind of
uh psycho going into the bathroom and
being like blue tampons
i'll never shop at fry's electronics
again
um
i've always had a reputation as being
one of the better general managers in
our company i haven't asked anybody
about it but i think they would agree
especially in terms of low turnover and
high employee morale i don't want my
employee to feel as though she's being
discriminated against because she's a
wonderful person and a great employee
but i just don't see how this is sexist
well
who's using the tampons and who's not i
guess would be my question on that one i
can see your point that men don't really
have an equivalent male exclusive item
but i don't see how that changes
anything in this specific instance
uh am i missing something okay here's
the edits
here we go
you know you know
and i i hate to do the king solomon i
always do the king solomon on this stuff
right
would it be possible to maybe like what
what if you install like a little
cabinet below the sink or something like
that
uh
and then you could have an area that
maybe the employees could put
stuff in
and then the customers don't have to see
it and if they start like opening up the
cabinet that's their own problem
like that seems totally fine
i mean how do how much does it take to
install a cabinet what like 25 000. i'm
joking i'm joking
okay sorry
this isn't okay
i i you know what annoys me about people
don't know how to argue okay
and it pisses me off i i apologize for
the rudeness but
they don't in order to get their point
made instead of strengthening their
argument by making another point they
just repeat
something that they got across earlier
and try to get a second bit of argument
strength for it
number one this is not a female bathroom
it's a single toilet unisex bathroom
it's the size of a closet and has a
toilet and a sink yes you've mentioned
that this strike it out it doesn't
matter
this is like when you're watching
impractical jokers and they're giving a
presentation and they click the slide
and there's like
one of them's naked lying in a bed
they're like that sounds bad you're like
i gleaned that
click that sounds i'm walking on sal's
carpet with muddy shoes i that sells
carpet i know it sounds carpet it's it's
implied
in the way that's his dog i know okay
you already said this stuff
you don't need to restate it
this is not my business so installing a
tampon or pad dispenser which i had a
thousand percent support is not remotely
my decision look okay
it's not that there's tampons
in the bathroom it's that they're not
locked in a vending machine that's the
problem
they're just there anybody could grab
him a kid could take him shove him up
his nose
you know pretend he's larry david from
season seven kirby or enthusiasm if you
just put it in like a little dispenser
and you could turn a crank and then they
could come out then it's fine
my employee
did not intend the tampons for use by
customers or other employees i asked
again i i don't see how it's relevant
this is this seems a bit like a straw
man to me
i'm not objecting to the tampons because
i don't understand how periods work on
gross stout but because it could really
cause problems if an auditor comes in
and sees what they will see as a
personal use product left in a public
area
i can't
verify that this would actually happen
but it seems insane to me
i i and again i don't work in business
inspection
[Laughter]
but i do look at like the vancouver
restaurant shutdown list
i've never seen one that said
uh because they they transparently
released the information they've never
in my entire life reading them i've
never seen one that was like there was
wrapped tampons in the bathroom
usually it's no hot water no hot water
rat infestation
no hot water is a lot of no hot water
i'm not again i don't work in this i'm
just saying
can they no no hot rats yeah exactly
but like how i just don't understand the
argument that you could
like have like toilet paper is fine and
like a garbage can that's full of
people's snot or whatever is totally
fine but like a rap tampax is like
that's across the line i know people are
going to be like auditors are crazy and
but i need like i would need to see like
a specific example there yeah you're
right it sounds like it's like the
tampon gestapo is coming around
is it
are you are you harboring
any tampax
yeah they're just on the counter they're
just on the sink um okay i'm not
objecting because they think they're
gross or whatever uh eddie just a couple
more clarifying points
this has been a pretty split decision so
far
in
all ways but the literal um it is a very
small store have i mentioned the size of
this place that the the tampons
make up a large amount of the density
of the store we've already established
the bathroom is very small
the tampa is the store is so itty bitty
the tampons are so noticeable like you
gotta you gotta move around them just to
get down the
aisle 10. there's no cabinet under the
sink or space for a cab there's no space
for a cabinet
i refuse to believe this
i don't buy it for a damn what do you
mean there's no space for a cabinet well
you don't have floors
how do you do you just open a mail slot
and stick your you know what in and then
pee in the toilet i don't understand
it's so small
the only places to put anything is
the floor
on the sink itself or on top of the
toilet
that being said a proprietary wall
mounted dispenser could work
it's not possible to mount a cabinet
but a dispenser could theoretically work
something that holds tampons could not
fit
unless it also had a large metal crank
on the front of it and a coin slot that
you could put a quarter into
otherwise it's not possible to put any
kind of mechanism that could hold these
things
i'm not permitted to make changes like
that to the facilities i will bring up
the option with hr
the office is roughly 10 steps from the
bathroom at most they are right next to
each other
objection your honor relevance we have
one or two employees on shift at a time
if there's one employee they're
encouraged to place a pre-made
bathroom sign on the store's door and
lock the door no question asked
i will readily admit my examples were
not a good comparison and not well
thought out in my fourth edit on my
second edit
okay now this is
the this is an appeal to uh
to his hurt feelings
to the people saying i'm an immature
misogynist insecure in my own
masculinity who's grossed out by
menstruation and tampons you're entitled
to your opinion but i'm just not i've
always been perfectly comfortable with
my sos and female roommates keeping
whatever they need wherever they need it
it's just the sanctity of of a fry's
electronics
it's just different okay in your house
if you want to keep that riff raff
around go by all means tampons open
drugs whatever pretty much on the same
level in my eyes
the sanctity of the corporate
environment
is it
is it too much to ask that we just treat
it with the respect and decorum that it
deserves
i will update this post after our
conversation with hr which has already
been scheduled for tomorrow
posted six days ago
um
okay
i mean look i we we have fun here
i don't think based on this post and you
know you're only getting a thin slice of
a person's life i don't think that he's
an immature misogynist insecure in his
own masculinity
i do feel
like maybe he's putting
i mean let me put it this way he's he's
got a little bit of a dwight uh schrute
energy to him like he clearly
takes the the station of his office as
one of the general managers at this
relatively smallish company very
seriously and is is upset about anything
that could possibly move up the chain
and reflect badly on him
uh
that being said
i really don't
i mean maybe
i was gonna say maybe i'm the [ __ ]
but i don't think that's true i just
don't see the problem
it's one of those things where i'm like
when something's this minor and people
are like well people might complain if
we do it i'm like well just why don't
you do it and then if people complain
we'll talk about it and if people don't
complain then you got nothing to worry
about just chill out poindexter like
there's nothing to
nothing to worry about
i i just i i agree i think it's kind of
making a mountain out of a mole hill
this is north america so like i'm not
saying this is just an american thing
but it's so [ __ ] up like how scared
companies are of their customers
i mean i guess in a way it's a good
thing but like
you know i think within reason like you
shouldn't be
in an environment where like the company
is just bending you over but instead
it's like you you know the the manager
is worried like the most insane person
on earth will walk into the bathroom and
be like you reminded me of my menstrual
cycle
i
spend fifteen thousand dollars a month
at this applebee's and i'm never coming
back now like it's just disgust there's
children here that could see the the the
pad with the wings on it and then how
are they supposed to eat their infinite
jalapeno poppers with that information
like it's just uh
i mean i i guess i kind of feel for like
the
i feel for the manager to the extent
that he feels so scared of
both the tampon auditor and like his own
customers
like that sucks but at the same i think
you got to kind of
i don't i'm i'm torn on this one because
i am also like
i don't know i don't know where i'm at
on this one i think he's more in the
wrong and i think quite frankly
his uh fixation on a dispenser being
okay but a a cabinet not being possible
like you know you could just make the
i mean i'm not saying he should do it
but you can get like a custom-made
cabinet this only like you know is is to
the size that you want it to be made
they make itty bitty ones much like your
bathroom they make enormous ones much
like some of the other stores but not
yours as you've made very clear um
i think i think if you just do that
you're you're fine but
i think you're
i think you got to be careful because if
you're like it doesn't bother me
but
it could bother other people
you got to figure out like where you
stand on that if it's like you know
having like your butthole out when
you're at work i can see his point that
some people might take offense to that
even if it wouldn't bother me but in
this situation i think that it strikes
me more as something that he's like i
don't like it and i'm gonna like
gaslight you into thinking that the
average person on planet earth out here
is like gonna be super offended by
seeing this stuff
i think he's he's my hunch and i'm just
one person
is that he's so he's using
a fictional
average person as a substitution for his
own aversion to this for whatever reason
that's my two cents
but i do also feel yeah it sounds like
corpus is kind of stinky so i feel i
don't think he's a huge [ __ ] i feel
like he's a bit of a
i don't know i mean in for a situation
that's so minor i feel like if you're a
good manager you got to stick out your
neck for
your employees instead of sticking out
your neck for a customer you haven't
even met
that may or may not even exist
am i the by the way build on your terms
from anywhere microsoft azure
sponsoring this episode uh
am i the [ __ ] for
blasting copyrighted music anybody some
anytime somebody tries to tick-tock
video on the bus or train
and i am on to get them strikes
as somebody who is a social media uh
content creator uh no
just based on this not the [ __ ]
i
despite being a content creator i get
well i guess it's literally an [ __ ]
move don't get me wrong but i also
i mean if it doesn't concern you i guess
yeah wait i'm coming back on this that
being said i you know what i made the
classic
am i the [ __ ] redditer mistake
i agreed with them
that the people he's being an [ __ ] to
are annoying and assumed you can't be an
[ __ ] to annoying people i i
appreciate that i was called out by chat
there that being said i
i get annoyed you know when people are
filming social media stuff in public
even as hypocritical as it is but let's
let's see
i've done this at least six or seven
times but the most recent time made me
curious so some girl a few days ago on
the bus i ride regularly had her friend
take her phone out and start recording
for tick tock and i quickly started
playing disney music then asked them to
stop because i don't care for being
recorded
she lost her [ __ ] yelled at me called me
an [ __ ] told me to turn the music off
and even tried to get me kicked off the
bus when i refused i turned it back on
every time they tried to record purely
to make sure they could get copyright
strikes if they tried to upload so
here's the question am i the [ __ ] yes
i was in shot they were filming from the
front of the bus and i usually sit at
the back you didn't have to tell me that
i knew you were a cool guy cool guys
always sit at the back
i should have noted this several other
people on the bus were annoyed with the
two girls running up and down the aisles
with their filming i wasn't the only one
i don't have this music on my phone i
jumped to youtube and played a video not
sure why i need to clarify this though
that's fine you don't um i did ask them
nicely a single time to stop her at the
very least record with me behind the
girl with the camera i was ignored hmm
um
i'm kind of with chat where i'm like i'm
not i don't totally believe that this
story happened
but i will also say i've ridden the bus
you know for several years in vancouver
some
[ __ ] that you would think is fake goes
down all the time
people just ripping open bags or like
spring mix and and digging in with their
hands and stuff like that
i got i got cyber bullied irl because i
was
the the bus got this i'll give you the
cliff notes our bus got clipped by a
drunk driver we all had to get off the
bus
in order to make sure there was no
damage we all got back on the bus
i was the last person on the bus and i
sat in one of the seats of the front
that is prioritized for the elderly and
people with mobility issues and then
somebody at the back of the bus just
started yelling at me and just went off
for like 20 minutes
and was saying some stuff that i will
not repeat
to begin with but i was my look is this
if we're going into the
am i the [ __ ] i still maintain i'm
not the [ __ ]
you don't have to give up you don't have
to abstain from the seats
until
somebody comes on
like if there's
you know
12 seats like that
you wait
if you can at least you wait until
somebody comes on and then you go i i'm
the first person to stand up
even when
like
just when a lot of people come on the
bus i'm like all stand up
because i just like standing man i sit
down all day but anyway they're not for
those passengers only it's for those
passengers
when
they're on the bus anyway
yeah people they want to make problems
for no reason anyway long story short um
that it's long story done i guess
but either way edit seven the seats on
the bus were blue i'm not sure why this
matters i'm not sure why i was forced to
make this edit uh
i mean
i don't know what to say man i don't i
don't know what to say okay
i i really thought this said yes i was
shot
i mean if they're being
kind of belligerent
you know if if they if if let's take
let's assume this happened to face value
rather than selectively discounting
stuff
uh
that feels like it's fake
if we take him in his word and he asked
them politely to stop or at least allow
him to get out of frame
and they ignored it then i don't feel
like he's an [ __ ]
if he said that he did that because it
makes him less of the [ __ ]
then
he's kind of an [ __ ]
it does say he's done it seven times
which is genuinely hilarious
i just scanned him it's like tick tock's
only really been around for like two
years so you're telling me that he's
he's doing this like you know once every
four months or something like that um
but it is also ignorant to uh
to film in public especially like it's
not like they were filming like a vlog
or something which can still be annoying
but it sounds like they were like
running up and down the aisles it's
annoying um
i don't know this i i'm i'm kind of of
like the
i'm kind of in the everybody sucks here
camp i guess
i kind of want to see some more comments
let's see
it's got seven teardrops tattooed
under his eyelid well not under his
eyelid i hope
okay so here's the classic okay
your bus your rules
um
maybe you're an [ __ ] but the people
who start recording on public
transportation deserve what they get is
this is exactly where i started
i think we can move from there um
they deserve what they i don't know if
you could ever say you deserve what you
get what what if he like you know
smash him in the kneecap with a tire
iron give him the tanya harding not the
[ __ ] people can tick-tock all the
live long day but they need to be
mindful of other people's right to not
be involved i i agree okay lol as if
they cared i know them personally this
happened my buddy eric we're all most
likely in one tick tock per day without
even knowing it
most mostly we're as if they cared
source dude just trust me we're all most
likely in one tick tock per day without
even knowing it source dude just trust
me 146 upvotes by the way
not the [ __ ] people need to be more
respectful of people around them so much
this you're genius
definitely not the [ __ ] tick tock is
the [ __ ] up dudes really wow up dudes
thank you so much for the gold kind
stranger
info were you actually in shot or was it
an option to move seats to be out of
shot rather than blasting music to annoy
the whole bus not just those filming
why should he have to get up and move
seats why should they inconvenience
everybody else well
look you're not gonna love this okay
because it's the [ __ ] bus
it sucks
like it's great
it's cheap it goes to most of the places
you want to go but you got to be around
other people that's
you know this is a public space
that's this kind of the deal
why should i ever have to change my life
for anybody else not the [ __ ]
sure you know i look
maybe the comments are not that good
here
[Laughter]
good for you i'm sick of this crap in
public places i haven't left my house in
six months but in my head it's just
constant you can't even walk to the
grocery store anymore without
tons of these freaking zoomers with
their tick tocks out
probably leaving their tampons
everywhere in public places wrapped up
in sanitary paper haven't even been open
yet it's crazy
okay i had to scroll for a bit
i'm gonna go and this is finally one
that agrees with me i'm gonna go and say
everybody sucks here filming tick tock
in public areas is annoying but they
also have to understand people around
them won't want to be filmed or that
they're a copyrighted materials all over
they suck for that but at the same time
blasting music in public transportation
is really annoying and obnoxious i would
have been annoyed with the both of you
that's i think if you if you put
yourself in the mindset of just the
other people on the train
instead of just having to um
you know deal with some
annoying teenagers
now you've got uh
two annoying teenagers and then also a
reddit cairo sedgero who is like i'm
gonna be the the trained defender
by playing a whole new world by disney
and and starting a fight on the bus like
you know
it it happens now and then on the bus or
the train people will do like [ __ ]
stuff
i am so thankful that whenever like i'm
on the skytrain and somebody says like
you know i remember one time i was on a
skytrain and this dude just kept going
like people getting on the skytrain with
their
[ __ ] backpacks you gotta take your
[ __ ] backpack off and put it on the
ground so there's room for and he was
getting like
and i just kind of like looked to my
left and looked to my right and i was
surrounded by normies who were just
going we know how you deal with this
situation you don't go excuse me sir
can you not use so many cuss words on
the train you just you know
wait till there you wait till your
stopper there stop this is a run out the
clock situation where we just you get
annoyed and then you talk about it over
cocktails later
anyway
this uh also like i don't feel bad cause
i don't think this story uh happened
that's that's my two cents is that i'm
not totally sure that this story uh took
place in the real world but um
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to go to a
concert
with my wife after she called the lead
singer her dream man
that this all depends on the band
as far as i'm concerned
if it's like
30 seconds to mars
then we gotta have a conversation
it's bono oh no
it's sugar ray that's even worse man
okay please tell me the band i gotta
know my wife is a big fan of rock music
crazy about a month ago she started
going on about one of her favorite bands
and how cute and talented the lead
singer is
of course that's no problem i'm not
jealous of a random celebrity however
she then proceeded to tell me this lead
singer is her exact type and her dream
man she even said at one point if only
he wasn't married but tried to make it
sound like a joke okay look this that's
pretty bad
like
i you you can say
like oh they're cute they're attractive
like etcetera etcetera um
but when you when you take it a step
further than that
if it it depends on how it came across
okay it depends on how the joke came
across you don't have to be insecure
like
if somebody was like oh if only he
wasn't married i'd totally be in it or
if only i wasn't married i'd totally be
into that
i don't think that in every situation
you could just be like oh flip the
script like what if the husband said
that about like paramore or something
like that
you know i but in this situation because
it strengthens my point i'm like
what if you flip the script on this one
for context this man literally could not
be more different from me i'm on the
bigger side mixed race short hair and
the musician is a skinny white dude with
long hair
i'm just laughing i didn't expect that
there would be a
race component here but okay um i know
she didn't mean it to be hurtful towards
me but it kind of stung to hear straight
up how different i am from her dream
type appearance wise and her comments
brought us some insecurities i thought
i'd gotten over it wasn't a big deal so
i didn't let her know this upset me at
the time and moved on from it turns out
the band is coming to our city in a few
weeks my wife originally wasn't able to
get tickets since they're so expensive
but this morning she texted me her
co-worker bought tickets but can't make
it and is willing to resell the two
tickets at a much lower price she called
me to confirm that i would go with her
and she should go ahead and get the
tickets i took a minute but i said oh no
honestly i'd rather not accompany you to
a concert where you're just gonna be
fawning over your dream man the whole
time
that's one that
clearly you've been turning over and
over
in your head in the shower for like
three weeks and it just
sometimes
just the most venomous kind of of
of message can come out of your brain
fully formed and it's clear that you've
been thinking about this way longer than
the person who casually asked the
question that's that's cringe i don't i
don't say that word often but that's a
little cringe clearly the wound had been
festering
but by the way also owned great line
like you turned it around on her and you
turned it around on her in a position
where
uh you have leverage because apparently
she needs your permission so you know
clearly someone here has read the art of
the deal
she seemed totally shocked by this and
responded why are you making this about
you we talked it out for a bit but i
didn't back down and told her i'm not
interested in going she can of course
take a friend or someone else but i
simply don't feel like going with her
this upset her a lot more than i thought
i would she came home from work nearly
in tears asking why i'm being petty and
selfish by not going with her she said
the lead singer is just a dumb celebrity
crush she was rambling about and it
makes no sense for me to be taking it
personally and making this an issue
between us i told her i'm not mad at her
or trying to
honey i'm not trying to start drama with
you you're my wife i don't want to start
drama with you
i just would prefer not to accompany her
to this particular show we haven't
talked since last night and i don't
really feel like apologizing am i the
[ __ ] for not budging on this
uh edit for everybody asking the band is
tame impala
i'm not cool enough i i tame impala was
getting popular
like
right as i
stopped listening to any song that came
out from that point forward so
as as soon as
real estate came out with beachcomber i
was done i was like i'm full
lead singer kind of looks like jesus
okay
does he
talk like an animal that you remember
talks like a gentleman not like an
animal what am i talking about anyway
um
look i don't like the killers either
i'm surprised okay
because i think uh
the judgment is not the [ __ ]
keep in mind how i started with this by
the way was by saying that i think she
went a little bit over the the line um
but i think he's definitely the [ __ ]
like he took you know what this is and
you you can really like make am i the
[ __ ] posts as i think you should
leave sketches this is
a guy and his wife go to uh magic show
the magician humiliates the guy
the wife
stokes the guy's insecurities and then
the guy goes back on stage and goes i
make ten times what you make
well you wouldn't know it from that suit
you ruined my life
[Laughter]
it's just uh
i'm just uh i i think his response he
clear his feelings were hurt but your
feelings can be heard and then the
action you take as a result of that can
be not commensurate with the slight that
led to your feelings being heard in the
first place and just because maybe the
first stone was not thrown by you that
doesn't mean that you're not the [ __ ]
for the way that you responded however i
don't even think he's like a huge
[ __ ] for saying
i don't want to go with you to a concert
where you're just going to be finding
over your dream man i think
that's an [ __ ] move but if he at
least with the benefit of hindsight what
appears to be like 18 to 24 hours later
if he had just been like hey i'm sorry
that i
hit you with a nuclear bomb when you
asked me if i wanted to go to the
concert but my feelings were actually
hurt by all the things that you said
about the lead singer in the first place
then it would be cool but then there
also would not be a post because instead
he has gone to reddit and been like am i
the [ __ ] so i think if the longer
this situation goes on for the more that
you're kind of the [ __ ] here for sure
like you the fact that you haven't
i mean like you is i she's not gonna
that leaves you for the lead singer of
tame impala okay
and if she does you can
get like a lot of play on like the talk
show circuit get interviewed by
pitchfork and stuff like that you you
know like you got an avenue to exploit
there
it's just a concert you're it's good
just take her to the concert and then
like is fine like i don't know it's
who cares
i just don't i i guess i i get that his
feelings were hurt but when you look at
it from a rational standpoint i'm just
like
why don't you just apologize to your
wife go to the concert they're a
well-liked band right
are they good if it was imagine dragons
i'd be like
hit the gym but
like get over it man
i guess
and by the way this not to the same
extent but this happens to me now and
then kate will watch like a k-pop video
and be like oh g-dragon's so hot i'm
like the anti-g dragon
i'm just like okay
whatever like what are you
[Laughter]
if big bang came to vancouver and she
was like do you want to come to the
concert i would be like let's go
i know this and they go
[Applause]
they're going to think i worked there
but you know that's fine
what the hell is g-dragon he's a bad boy
he smoked marijuana in a japanese
bathroom
it was a big a big
controversy in 2011
because in in
south korea pop stars don't do bad boy
stuff they're like the
the way that they're bad boys is like by
having an earring whereas in north
america if you're like a bad boy you'd
like you know throw a tv out of your
hotel room window or something like that
in south korea it's like he took a puff
of a joint in a
japanese bathroom stall
anyway
um
yeah okay there was that one guy we
don't even he got a sentence like a
couple years or two a few years in
prison last week right anyway um that
that's not a bad boy that's a bad guy
that's two different things
the bad boy
is like a veneer he's just a bad person
okay this
there's a distinction there
i do i want i want to see the comments
here because it's always more fun to
look at the comments when you disagree
right um let's let's see on this one
i already know and i hate to like hand
wave this away as if it's not like a
real problem by the way
um
42 may be the answer to life the
universe and everything is this dude so
much this
but when it comes to your team's
processes you need a platform that's
customized to your needs on monday.com
you can build the perfect project
management tools for your workflows
um
so much this man i i already know that
my
assumption is that some of the
uh
comments that are up near the top are
going to be things that are like
not the [ __ ] she way across the line
your feelings were hurt etc etc um but
i'm i don't know maybe it's difference
of opinion maybe it's
difference in perspective but i am
also kind of like
if your feelings can get
you if your feelings get hurt and you're
gonna like fester on it you also have to
take some responsibility for not telling
her that at the time
you know if if if you really were
bothered by something and you're gonna
let it simmer and build resentment and
then come back with like uh you know an
uppercut later when you get jabbed
slightly then you had a responsibility
that you messed up a little earlier to
be like hey that's over the line at
which point you wouldn't have had to
worry about it at all
you know because you she would have been
like oh i apologize and then you know
what i mean it's always easier in
hindsight but
i'm actually super surprised with all
the you're the [ __ ] here it's not
like you're preventing her from going to
the concert i too think of every dispute
that happens in a marriage as uh you
know being a set of pros and cons and
it's more of like a a tort law dispute
as opposed to you know two individuals
with responsibilities and commitment and
feelings it's not like you're she can
still go to the concert she'll just not
be able to enjoy it at all because
she'll be thinking about the fact that
you know her husband is mad at her for
being at the concert
you just don't want to go with her i can
understand how it may be a bit hurtful
to hear your wife constantly go on about
wishing she was with someone else
it doesn't matter if it's a complete
fantasy that would never happen saying
someone the exact opposite of you is her
exact type sounds harsh maybe she didn't
mean it that way maybe you wrote it in a
way that reflects as poorly on her as
possible or or maybe not um but i don't
think it's unreasonable for you to be
heard let her find a friend to go to
with her
agreed but often the replies are from
children who shouldn't even be allowed
on the internet i feel bad they're even
allowed to be giving ratings in this sub
or the replies
are from relationships where they shared
celebrity crushes without the esso
getting jealous
oh man
i'm 18 and this is what the real world
is like
so many kids so many eight-year-olds
logging on to am i the [ __ ]
writing essays about uh
how they should solve their relationship
problems
not the [ __ ] your feelings are valid
you're not being malicious
can i and again i could
i could be wrong this is i where where i
consider myself superior to most of the
comments
to be honest is that i always like this
this is not me coming from on high
giving my objective
viewpoint of how things go
is just my giving my opinion in two
cents okay i'm not saying this is
definitively the right way i think if
your wife says
can we go to this concert for my
favorite band and then you reply
honestly i'd rather not accompany you to
a concert where you're just going to be
fawning over your dream man the whole
time that's malicious
because you this is a comment designed
to
get back at someone because they hurt
your feelings
like you're like i'm gonna
this is not like
what you say when you want to come to a
solution this is like
i'm gonna get back at you because you
made me feel bad
so i'm gonna like flip the script on it
that's he should have said yeah after he
said that and she started to cry he's
supposed to go
oh shot that
to try to like defuse the situation a
little bit
you ruined my life
um okay hold on
she blinds she's blindsided and upset
now because your legitimate feelings
appear to come out of nowhere yes
correct
this this i disagree with this part
but
i totally agree with this part if your
feelings were hurt you should have said
something about it then
again perfect world but i'm surprised by
all you're the [ __ ] i'm fairly
certain if it was a man fawning over a
female celebrity and his wife was
uncomfortable no one would call her an
[ __ ] um
you know
let me think about that for a second
because i flipped the script and now
he's flipping the script on me
all right i'm willing to i'm willing to
seed that point
i think if you flip to the exact same
situation
um he would come across like an [ __ ]
but there is also the and again this you
get yourself in trouble with this one
but still um
what what the f
man i'm just saying
the cultural norm
i think again it could be wrong the
cultural norm it's more normal
for a wife to talk about her celebrity
crushes than the husband i don't know
why it is
i didn't create the culture
i'm i'm a participant actively feeding
into it as time goes on but it would be
like a a wife being like oh my celebrity
crush is like antonio banderas that's
like something that doesn't cross the
bounds of normalcy that happens
all the time but if if i was and they
wouldn't make me uncomfortable if i was
like having dinner with uh you know if i
was on a double date or something and
then my friend's wife was like oh you
know like i love joel mchale i would be
like okay that's normal if
if he said
yeah i want to [ __ ] allison brie i would
be like okay maybe we should just calm
down a little bit all this talk about
community has
everybody's getting heated
[Laughter]
so this whoopee cushion is getting
swoopy cushion's gotten everybody too
excited
that being said i'm not saying that
that's uh i'm not saying that that's
right i'm simply saying
that that's
those one of them fits more with the
culture and one of them fits less with
the culture whether or not that's valid
you know is is a different point
altogether so i'm not sure there's a
situation where you can flip this script
but
anyway i'm i am stunned at the number of
people who are like you aren't stopping
her from going to the concert yeah like
you're not restraining her from going to
the concert
but like
you kind of are
you're like in a psychological sense
like you really think that
she's gonna be like okay and then like
hey jenny come to the concert with me
and like she's gonna have a great time
watching her favorite band she's not
gonna enjoy it knowing that this is
something that's driven a wedge between
her and her husband
it's yeah it's an it's an ultimatum
without having the the courage to offer
the ultimatum in the first place
she could still go and just have
terrible memories wrapped up with it
like come on
not the [ __ ] for you to have so many
differences in appearance to the singer
in her outright saying that he is her
exact type would make anyone make the
connection that you are not her type you
have every right to take it personally
agreed and then we're flipping the
script however
i wish that there was just there's like
one
implied sentence here
well actually you're right there's a
couple of things one is she did marry
you
so
like
you're probably like kind of her type or
like one of her types
[Laughter]
for one and then also
i was waiting for the like you have
every right to take it personally
but you should have talked about that in
the moment rather than
spend 20 showers concocting the perfect
comeback if this situation situation
ever came to pass but instead we get the
script flip again but
not the [ __ ] why would she say this
to you
your feelings are valid i wouldn't want
to go to the concert either i'm
surprised at all the yta comments
this is one of those it's easy to judge
when it's not you situations look that
might be true
but look at the subreddit you're on i
mean
that's kind of what it's there for
hey i've been married to my wife for 20
years we had one argument
you know let's distill it down to three
sentences
i if i had the guests remember the post
that was like this is why your kids
don't get along oh actually their father
died in a traumatic accident when they
were young that drove an emotional wedge
between them don't care didn't ask plus
your kids are ugly like this this is
what this subreddit is made for
i'm happy to look comment deleted by
user they probably got cyberbullied user
was cyberbullied for this post i'm happy
to see someone else who thinks everybody
sucks this kind of fantasy fantasy crush
and sharing it with your partner is not
uncommon or unreasonable op's wife
messed up actually heard him
maybe it was unintentional probably okay
i i would hope to agree and then he
messed up by pretending to himself and
to her that it was no big deal when in
fact he was quite hurt by it and it
brought up insecurities for him
good
so far so good
all right so far i agree
so she's in the wrong for going on and
on about her crush to the point where it
hurt opi's feelings but o p's in the
wrong for sweeping those feelings under
the rug instead of talking with her
honestly about them and then blindsiding
her with them when she had the rare
chance to purchase tickets and needed to
act fast
too reasonable for reddit right now
so much this your wife loves you and
doesn't want to hurt you if she didn't
give you a crap about your feelings she
would have just shrugged off your
statement and said whenever and gone
with a friend without batting an eye but
she does care your words are not the
only thing she's listening to when you
say you can go but i won't come just to
watch you fawn over him
what you're communicating is i feel like
you've chosen him over me and i don't
want to be faced with your feelings for
him if you go without me it'll just
solidify for me that you care more about
indulging in this crush than in being
with your partner this person
is better than me
at the
at the react court
they're even more articulate than i am
so yeah you're wanting to assuage your
feelings by setting aside a rare chance
you're wanting her to assuage your
feelings by setting aside a rare chance
to see a band she really loves instead
of just doing a little introspection and
admitting you have feelings
and talking to her honestly about them
even if it's hard to put into words and
you feel stupid o.p please take
ownership of the pieces of the peace you
could have handled better in most
conflicts
there's a little blame to go around for
everyone apologize for the way you
brought this up apologize for not
telling her when she first heard your
feelings but tell her your her words
were hurtful and that you do genuinely
feel she must not find you terribly
attractive if you accept her apology the
two of you can figure it out
how do you give awards on reddit this is
like
i did madmanmax224
i'm not congratulations or i'm sorry
that happened to you i'm not gonna read
all that i'm not sure she actually cares
about his feelings based on her response
like when she came home in tears hours
later like a total [ __ ]
and when she didn't walk through the
door with a six-pack in her hand and be
like babe i'm so sorry you're totally
right i shredded the concert tickets
like
it's clearly she doesn't care about your
feelings
i'm not sure she actually cares about
his feelings based on her response it
was immature and insensitive it's
clearly bigger than some dumb celebrity
crush based it's i wasn't there it was
clearly bigger than the celebrity crush
based on the vocabulary
and honestly it's genuinely hurtful to
see someone you love express their
desire to be with somebody else
yes and no i guess is what i would say
like
[Laughter]
look so you
did
i
i'm getting stun locked by like
anonymous teenagers on reddit but i'm
just like
i just don't understand
that it's like so over the it seems like
she made a joke that just like went too
far
and what
she shouldn't have made it
but he also shouldn't have been like
everything's fine it's not i'm like a
big strong guy nothing hurts me and then
years later well maybe days later be
like you screwed me you've wounded me
and now i finally now that you're
showing me some vulnerability i can get
back at you
the fact that she was surprised due to
his lack of communication aside her
overall response was childish and
incredibly immature reverse the ev every
comment has reversed the situation and i
doubt you would rule the same
man
played the uno reverse card
yep then she had the audacity to accuse
him
of trying to make this about him when
all he's doing is expressing his
feelings he isn't telling her not to go
just that he doesn't want to spend hours
watching her ogle over her obsessive
celebrity crush [ __ ] that manipulative
[ __ ]
[Laughter]
so dramatic man i i'm i'm fine with and
everybody sucks here yeah
i i think that uh
her joke went too far as we said when we
started this but also simultaneously i
think that you know
he he clearly then went too far in the
other direction
everybody sucks here and you're not
based
you're reading it dramatically look at
how it's written
[ __ ] that manipulative [ __ ] that's even
that's the tick tock explainer voice
i can't do it without losing a piece of
my spirit
okay slash marker react court
one



we got a lot more react court left to go
here
i was originally thinking we could hit
up another subreddit but i think i got
stun locked so hard we've only gone
through like two posts
we got some uh we got some more meat to
pull off the off the bone here if i
could figure out how to get back okay oh
no there's there's a not safe for work
one coming up
oh no no no no no no
am i the [ __ ] for disinviting my
younger daughter's girlfriend to our
family dinner because it upsets my older
daughter
there's absolutely no way you can get
out of this one without being the
[ __ ]
originally i read it like am i the
[ __ ] for disinviting my older
daughter's girlfriend to our family
dinner because it upsets my younger
daughter and i was like yeah
but like maybe if your younger daughter
is like
five
i could at least see you having
a thought about it even if it makes no
sense to me and it's kind of like your
job as a parent to to teach this stuff
but seeing that they're 28 and 25 i'm
like
hold on let's see where we're going here
okay
i'm the [ __ ] for disinviting my
younger daughter's girlfriend
to our
you're this is not even let's ignore the
girlfriend part okay
like the the the fact that maybe this is
uh
i i mean i'm a well you know what i this
says something about me because i was
assuming that it was like
based on some degree of homophobia but
maybe not maybe
she just doesn't like her but even still
you know
we can't be uninviting your children's
significant others to a dinner anyway
let's let's actually read it okay
good point good point
i have two daughters
it's a japanese whiskey let's just call
her whiskey
whiskey and ally
who is 28 and 25.
whiskey is currently staying with us so
her dad and i can look after her while
she's being treated for depression after
breaking up with her boyfriend of five
months okay so they have added
a little
it's not just like everybody was fine
and then i introduced the problem okay
uh
let's take it from there
so the older daughter's staying with
them because she has she's recovering
from depression it sounds shallow and i
can hardly believe like oh
no no no no no
because she's
recovering from depression it sounds
kind of shallow and i myself can hardly
believe she crumbled like this over a
guy who she dated for only a relatively
short amount of time but for whatever
reason it hit her hard
the the mental health expert has logged
on
it's been a difficult time for us even
with therapy and medication she's lost a
lot of weight and still cries almost
every day
ally has been with her girlfriend kara
since january we never met kara in
person because they live two states away
we've spoken through video calls cara is
a very sweet person two weeks ago she
sent us a cake as a gift you
you give him a shovel because he's
digging whiskey didn't say anything but
i later saw her crying and when i asked
why she said it reminded her of the time
when her ex-boyfriend was the one giving
us gifts she couldn't eat for three days
after that and we were so worried we
went back to her psychiatrist to
increase the dosage of her medication
look
let's just keep reading okay
next week my husband and i will be
celebrating our 30th wednesday wedding
anniversary this is in that when you go
the whole audience claps
and ally will be flying home so we can
have a family dinner
she asked if she could take cara with
her so we can finally meet her in person
i said yes when i told whiskey about it
she didn't say anything but spent the
most of her following days crying when i
talked to her and asked what's wrong she
said that she felt like dying every time
she remembers that her ex would have
also gone to our anniversary dinner if
they didn't break up she told me how she
felt guilty all over again and how their
breakup was her fault because she raised
issues she was not comfortable with and
that if she just kept quiet that they
would still be together
her psychologist told me this is a
recurring event for people who are
depressed
they can get triggered by the smallest
things they blame themselves okay with
that in mind i decided maybe this isn't
the time to meet cara
since whiskey is emotionally unstable
and we don't don't know what could
trigger her i told ali i'm sorry but i
don't think our anniversary dinner will
be a good time to have cara over
ali got upset and said it's embarrassing
they have to explain this all to kara
and then she feels i'm playing favorites
she said that she and kara shouldn't
have to make adjustments just because
she broke up with her boyfriend did i do
the wrong thing
this is all [ __ ] up this is just not a
good situation
it's
it's definitely this is not like the fun
am i the [ __ ] where i was like you
know i tried to control another adult's
life am i the [ __ ] and people are
like no your house your rules this is
one where
like
i don't necessarily look
i don't i don't and you're not gonna
hear this might be the first time i've
ever said this like i don't i don't feel
uh
comfortable like passing judgment like
on anybody in this situation
it just seems it just seems bad
now do i want to read the comments to
see uh
what kind of code of hammurabi [ __ ]
the top comments have
have come up with to
[Laughter]
i do but i don't want to do it on camera
so i think we'll probably just move on
to the next one but you know what
that's uh i mean that's that's a tough
one
i i don't have any information to to add
on to that one
i almost
is how how not safe for work could a
text post be okay
am i the [ __ ] for exposing my
husband's swinger lifestyle to his
family i'm just just i'm just gonna put
it off camera for a second okay
just to see because if it's just like
he swings whatever if it's like he likes
to put his blah and the blood and then
go
like maybe i'll skip it but
it seems fine
okay
i have been married to my husband for
five years my husband's family are your
typical snotty catholic mega religious
people my husband is not religious but
still remains respectful of their
beliefs and has always lived his second
life in private
you can do that you you can you can be a
swinger and not uh tell your grandma
it's what there's some
haven't you heard the random rules no no
one should have two lives now my middle
names are wrong and right
i joined a dating app with the sole
purpose of finding us another couple or
even a unicorn
chat can i get a little help on this one
a unicorn is
the swinging term for a bisexual
single woman okay thank you
because i
who doesn't want a relationship okay
thank you appreciate it now i feel like
i'm up to speed here um thank you thank
you for the education chat is so hoarse
with the horn on his head
[Laughter]
oh man
well if you can find one of those geez
louise we are living in the future this
was my husband's idea usually we go to
parties where we feel safe and not
judged i'd never use a dating app so i
posted your typical what i do for work
what movies and music i like i identify
as bisexual so myself and my husband
have shared a few women and never had an
issue well on the app i guess some girl
who knows my husband and his family saw
me they confronted me in front of
everyone and accused me of cheating his
aunt said horrible things about me i
tried to tell them he knew but he didn't
back me up or say anything the argument
got even more heated and that's when i
exposed us i told his family everything
how we've shared other women slept with
other couples and even that they've
babysat while we did this i believe that
was the [ __ ] part my husband felt
that i disrespected his family for
saying that even though he didn't stick
up for me while they called me uh i
don't
even want to say it among other things
now his innocent holy reputation is
ruined and he says because of me he
can't show his face to his family am i
the [ __ ] they see this is more fun
i don't i don't think she's the [ __ ]
at all
like what what would what's the
alternative to this situation once she
gets called uh
when she gets called out like this if
he's not stepping in to protect her you
know with the truth
the dude should have stepped the dude
didn't even have to
say like oh word like swinging or
whatever he could have just been like
you know yeah i knew
[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] you know
you just come up with something you
didn't have to like shoot your whole
load pun intended i suppose but like
she she also could have said that i
don't know i would be mad i that i was
being thrown under the bus by like the
only person who who can like get me out
of this jam without me exposing their
secret
he could have just told his parents or
his family to like mind your own
business
he is 27 years old
that's okay
she didn't have to
say all the stuff that she said
but simul or
simultaneously i'm like you know
i think she was kind of getting back at
him for being silent and i gotta say
you go girl
then also you can't be mad about what
people do when you babysit
it's not a you're not a paramedic it's
not like oh you called me for this like
if you were going to see like some
shitty movie you'd be like well that's
one thing but you guys were practicing
an alternative lifestyle i'm not looking
after your kid anymore it's just
if you were going to see shang chi the
legend of the ten rings that would be
one thing but you're going out here to
you're getting involved in all this
dirty stuff
are you defending yourself yeah because
i'm trying to get a babysitter so i can
go see
shanghai in the legend of the ten rings
man
i haven't missed the marvel movie
opening weekend since like i don't even
know i think since doctor strange came
out
it's been a while
ah not not the [ __ ] and you know what
i mean that's a perfect ratio right
there not the [ __ ] 69 percent
also i do kind of feel like um
her and her husband have made made a
mistake here simultaneously as well you
know
like if if you want to keep it
i don't know i have no experience with
this but i'm like if you want to keep it
private then maybe don't make a public
dating profile
but simultaneously
your husband should have backed you up
no no problem there anyway
not everybody sucks though you know is i
i think her husband sucks she's not the
[ __ ] am i the [ __ ] for asking my
boyfriend to cancel dinner with his son
and daughter-in-law because i was
specifically not invited
if these
come up all the time
like it just makes me realize that like
i guess i have good friends and like
nice family members
never in my life have i ever
seen a situation where they were like
please don't invite
you know your significant other
but just everybody is just treated as
like a package deal
you can't invite one without the other
because that's they're like they're a
unit you know
this is crazy anyway boring boring we've
seen it
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting my
boyfriend's kids to come over anymore
oh i l i love a wedding one
am i how could this happen
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to give up
my dream
wedding dress
though it means my fiance's family
will not attend
am i the [ __ ]
for refusing to give up on my dream
wedding dress though it means my
fiancee's family will not attend maybe
it's revealing
let's see
oh
baby there's some edits
[Laughter]
i'm in a lot of turmoil right now and it
feels like everything's falling apart
now you know you've sufficiently made me
feel guilty for trying to mine this for
humor
but moving on i had have never had a
great relationship with my future
mother-in-law it isn't terrible but i
can sense that she doesn't like me my
fiance is very close to his family so
there's been some tension
i didn't invite mother-in-law wedding
dress shopping because our relationship
is awkward
but i thought i'd show her a picture to
make her feel included my dress is a
beautiful flowy beach
beachy dress but not technically a
wedding dress and could be ordered in
color i bought it from a small local
boutique that we both love here
mother-in-law said that i can't wear
that dress because she bought the same
one for her 50th birthday which is two
weeks after my wedding
is this really worth
breaking up the family over
[Laughter]
mother-in-law does have the dress though
in a mint green color there's enough
detailing that it is clearly the same
dress and she has the receipt to prove
she got it first
okay lavish birthday parties are a thing
in our circle so i know she has invested
serious time and money in this party i
said that i'm still gonna wear the dress
despite the fact that i could easily
return it with no loss because i didn't
do this out of malice and i love it
mother-in-law says if she wears it two
weeks after i do everyone is gonna think
she's pathetic and copying her son's
wife i said sorry but peter parker dot
wave i miss the part where that's my
problem
this is so good
everyone has gone crazy since i said
that
his entire side of the family and the
friends mother-in-law invited have all
backed out of the wedding so like 15
people and it will be noticeable his
sisters were supposed to be in the
wedding party on his side but dropped
out and have blocked him on everything
[Laughter]
they blocked him
they blocked their own brother on
everything because
he
his
fiancee is going to wear the wedding
dress that his mom's going to wear to
her 50th birthday party
that's crazy man
oh my god i'm i i glanced further his
stepdad won't talk to him and says he
regrets raising him and he isn't a this
can't be real he he isn't a real man
because a real man would stand up for
his mom his bio dad is even on
mother-in-law's side which doesn't
surprise me because they are good
friends but he called us up just to
shame us the other night my fiance is
hurting and found that his family had a
big beach day and invited everyone but
him
he called mother-in-law and they talked
but didn't come to a resolution she said
if i refuse to do the right thing the
only answer is no one going to her party
can go to the wedding he tried calling
sister-in-law and found out she blocked
him he is mad at me now and feels like
she had it first
okay so that's the end before the edits
this is insane
let me just start by saying i am let's
assume it's real because that's we
that's the only way we can ever discuss
these to begin with um the fact that
this is and everyone sucks is
hilarious to me i want to make sure that
that computes this is because i'm okay
so when i scroll down i see not the
[ __ ] eventually won out um
i i couldn't imagine this being like a
plurality of everybody sucks here
cause like
look i hate to say it there's a
hierarchy of events
okay wedding
pretty close to the top of the list
maybe there's some other stuff up there
surgeries
child's birth like you know
admittedly
can i funerals of course yes
but
wedding is close to the shang chi in the
legend of the ten rings um new isaac
expansion
et cetera et cetera
wedding is high it's near the
top when you have it you're like this is
the only one i'm going to have
whether that ends up happening you know
for i mean this lady appears to have
had a couple herself so maybe she
doesn't treat it with the decorum that
it was designed to have but either way
50th birthday i'm going to be honest
like it's probably
in the top half
it's bet it's more important than your
51st is more important than your 47th
birthday
but it's way below wedding like it's
substantially below
uh
you're especially like your first
wedding
but maybe people don't want to hear that
but like you know if a friend of mine
had been divorced five times and he's
like i'm getting married this july i'd
be like we might skip this one
i'll catch the reboot
so like just getting that the the
foundation of it out of the way
who
cares
like
isn't it like you're already rich
clearly
can you just like shut the [ __ ] up
who cares
you're gonna she's gonna she gets to
choose whatever dress she wants to wear
it's her wedding everyone would agree on
that
oh sorry you can't wear this dress to
your wedding because i'm wearing it to
my 50th birthday beach party that's just
idiotic
you can wear the whatever you want to
your wedding you can wear whatever you
want to your beach party if you get
annoyed
that other people are going to be like
oh you're copying
your daughter-in-law then you can buy a
new dress
uh
especially because you still got the
receipt this is not like a first-come
first-served situation like i got dibs i
bought it first you know the wedding
trumps a birthday party it's the rules
man
um
also your family or your husband's
family is insane
this is
idiotic
normally when i read these i'm like
people need to talk more this is one
where i'm like
you are actually you've been done like
an incredible service by the fact that
these people want to remove themselves
from your life
they did it without you having to do it
you get to maintain like the moral high
ground
and you know how many times you could
you could talk to like 98
of the
earth's population and if you if you
were like yeah they uh blocked their son
and brother on everything because i was
gonna wear the same dress to my wedding
that they were gonna wear to their mom's
50th birthday party uh people would be
like that's crazy
you could farm that for attention for
the rest of your life
i think you've been given an incredible
a glimpse into the future and an
incredible gift
that's my take on this
see you look at this cute baby
i do need to see
i mean like i'm assuming this is one
where i don't want to click on the
comments because i'm like i think
they're all just going to agree with me
uh
but i would like let's see the first
everybody sucks here
there's gotta be one like i know it's
gonna be you can wear whatever you want
okay they seem to agree
pass everybody sucks here all of you
sound difficult except possibly your
esso who's caught between a bunch of
self-righteous and title people who
don't care about the damage they do
i i can't believe it's the second
comment down
this the mother-in-law is difficult but
so is op you could have been the bigger
person and got in another dress
seems like o.p chose it to make it more
difficult and is a bit of a b tied zilla
1.2 000 upvotes
you should help your fiance out and not
wear the dress get a different one
because you're ruining his relationship
with his family and yeah they're being
[ __ ] but he loves them and you're
driving the wedge
this is what she did was
she's being a so b titan zilla is a
bridezilla
it really doesn't sound like she's uh
being a bridezilla for
wanting to wear the dress that she
picked out
and uh
her whole family
blocking their own son and brother
because of the fact that the woman that
he's gonna marry
is gonna wear the dress that they're
gonna
then wear to a birthday party later
is a substantial degree of magnitude
above
just wanting to wear whatever dress you
actually chose for your own wedding
okay she did say that's your problem
which is very funny
but maybe she could have said it in a
nicer way
it is their problem but still
it would have been better if she sent
the picture of tobey maguire though um
everybody sucks here to be honest you
kind of walked into this one by
purchasing a non-wedding dress from a
local boutique that the two of you both
like you should have just gone to like
some kind of industrial wedding store
you could have taken a flight to spain
and bought a wedding dress there or
something like that happens all the time
this is what you get for shopping at the
same store you get you have honey you
reap what you sow there was always going
to be a distinct possibility of
something like this happening maybe you
can suggest going dress shopping with
your future mother-in-law to find her a
new dress for her birthday that sounds
like that's going to be a fun time
i'd love to be a fly on the wall for
that brunch
it seems like this
oh 50th birthdays are kind of a big deal
not like a wedding but a significant
milestone so i understand she wants to
look nice for it and there's probably
still a good chance a large number of
the guests of the birthday will have
also attended the wedding and she's not
totally out of line for thinking people
might say she copied you and this is
where you say but who gives a [ __ ]
at
all clothes are meant to be worn
you could i mean why don't you just tell
them the truth i bought it first
actually did you know i actually bought
it first
or
what have you just said you know she
looks so good in it i thought maybe i
would pick up one for myself or just go
haha yeah anyway moving on
we closed the merger last week and now
our bank account's grown by like another
eight figures like i just don't
understand why this has to be such a big
deal
but again you're the one buying your
wedding dress from a non-local bridal
boutique so you were running the risk of
buying something that other people would
want to wear to non-wedding events and
as you know
clothes
as soon as you take them off they
explode
the concept of wanting to wear this
every whenever i go to h m
which is where i buy many of my finest
outfits
i buy an eight dollar t-shirt off a rack
where there's 15 of them
put it on
pay for it
two weeks later i'm wearing it if i see
somebody else wearing it i say listen
buddy what the [ __ ] do you think is that
is that basic basic m from h m burgundy
basic amp
i'll have you know today's the day i'm
okay there's 35 000 of them uh being
worn in vancouver right now it's on site
buddy
don't you know i'm wearing this and it's
uh i'm only three months away from uh my
33rd birthday
oh it's the 10th anniversary of your bar
mitzvah yeah well uh my mom
uh
is celebrating
uh her uncle's birthday next friday
let's it's just crazy man who who cares
you're wearing the same
just
they're meant to be worn i guess is what
it's just
i mean if you are like this if you get
wealthy and you act like this you're
actually just
stupid and i
don't apologize for saying it
like you're it seems like they got it
all together like from a financial
standpoint just [ __ ] off and enjoy being
rich
canapes in the garden
you know people bringing around
cocktails to you while you you talk
about dumb [ __ ] nobody cares about just
enjoy your life why why add this
needless drama and be miserable
like people who have real struggles it
just seems like you you you royally
screwed up if you can be
wealthy enough to care about this and
then you also care about it
it's like a simulatory problem it's not
it's not a real stress
which i know is rich coming from a
twitch streamer but i'll be the first
person to tell you i'm a bit of a
hypocrite myself
i'm something of a hypocrite myself i
wish i missed the part where that's my
problem not the [ __ ] i'm fighting i'm
finding this hard to believe
absolutely
i do agree with that
everybody sucks here you're all
sacrificing relationships over a dress
no one here is in the right
i love i love the idea that you could
just fix this by seeding to an unreal
unreasonable demand
it no matter how thin the paper is it's
still got two sides
can't you see you're in love
and then i feel so bad for for your
husband
he's torn
between the worst human beings of all
time and the person he chose to spend
the rest of his life with how can i
choose
it's not possible
ah all i know
is that i'm completely innocent in this
situation and had absolutely no role in
how it played out
oh my god
it's going to give me like an aneurysm
man
i'm just i'm scrolling
oh man yeah we got like we got like 18
minutes here it's so good
we can we can finish off with like top
of the week we want plates but i think
we got a couple more here
am i the [ __ ] for wanting my
boyfriend to get a better job
this is a weird one because usually
the headline makes them seem like
there's no way they couldn't be an
[ __ ] but i'm like hey
wanting someone to get a better job not
[ __ ]
the way that you say it
or the reason that you say it might
matter
my boyfriend and i have been dating for
a year and it's been going mostly good
except he doesn't make much and i have
to pay for everything not related to
basic necessities we don't leave
together at the more at the moment so he
pays for his rent car food
and that's about all he can afford
so
he does pay for
things
like i mean i get that you're saying
he only pays for like the basic
necessities but it's
i mean you're knocking out your rent
your car and your groceries like that's
you're doing okay
whenever we go out i have to pay for all
the date nights trips and even gas for
road trips since he can't afford
anything but the basics he makes 28k as
a meatpacker i make 94k as a data
engineer okay i mean there's a there's a
disparity
i don't care that he makes less but he
makes so little that in our area he
can't afford much besides to go to work
and go to sleep if we want to go camping
i have to buy or rent all the equipment
pay for gas pay for the park fees and
camping
you can tell that they're in love
otherwise we can only sit at home and
play video games or cook something
together which we do but i don't want to
do that every weekend here's what i'm
going to say okay
this sh what she's writing is not nice
that's
obvious
like it's not a
kind thing to write
that being said
if
they are in love
and
she wants him to have some extra
ambition i could understand it creating
the conflict but i'm just that's one
paragraph okay i know it's not so easy
you don't strap on your job helmet go
into job land let's this is just the
preamble we don't pass judgment yet in
every situation let's see what happens
from this point onwards
the other problem is he doesn't have
much motivation to get skills or get a
better job he worked for the meatpackers
after finishing a semester at culinary
school but he only did that because his
dad is a chef i don't think he's
depressed or anything like that i've
known him since high school and he's
always kind of been this way after high
school i went to college and dated guys
also when working they made more and had
more motivation but they were flaky and
i wanted someone and just wanted someone
they can sleep with he is actually
someone who wants a family but now i'm
worried about how we can be compatible
in marriage when he isn't motivated to
better himself also i don't want to
carry him financially through the
marriage
this is a tough one
my friend has an auto body shop and he
likes to hang out there i've been
searching up mechanic courses and sent
them to him asking if he's interested he
got mad at me saying i was judging him
for not having a fancy job but he was
happy with his current job that he can
just go there and go home and he doesn't
want to go to school or put anything
more into what he just considers a means
of survival we got into a fight where i
told him i'm finding it harder to see a
future for us where i'm when i have to
pay for everything in the relationship
he told me i'm just gonna have to accept
him or gtfo and stormed out
well um
hey this uh is another one that seems
like it just kind of sucks i i don't
think people are gonna necessarily agree
with her
but i think she's being fair in the
sense that like
you know it seems like
her future
idea of what she wants her family to
look like is not possible given
you know the job that her partner has
so i think she's kind of basically
coming to the terms
with the fact that they're incompatible
it yes i i agree i mean i'm not saying
they should break up because i don't
know
like
any more about their situation all i'm
saying is it seems like he's like this
is the life that i want to lead and i'm
happy with it and she's like we can't
have a family like this and then it
maybe they should not be together then
thanks for your responses i realize it
does bothers me it does bother me that
i'll have to pay for him if we continue
so i'll let him know tonight we have to
go our separate ways i was attached for
nostalgic reasons just had the talk
weirdly he was shocked i told him i
wanted to break up told me he thought we
actually had it but i ruined it told him
i'd rather ruin it now than be unhappy
he sighed got his stuff and left feeling
kind of relieved actually that was good
good ending
now
do you have to when i always wonder in
these situations do you go to your
significant other and then go
the internet told me to break up with
you
apart from that i'm like this is uh
this seems like the the exact outcome i
would have thought
makes the most sense here
temporarily sad but then
positive from that point onwards
babe they said you're the [ __ ]
i wonder what the votes were here you're
the [ __ ] 50 percent
not the [ __ ] 27
i guess so you know it's cowardly not
the past judgment here
i don't know like i don't i don't i
don't see her as being an [ __ ] here i
see her as wanting something different
i don't think she
look would i be annoyed if
i felt like i was being nagged to get a
better job and then when i was hanging
out with my friend at her at his auto
body shop she sent me a link to like you
know go to mechanic school i'd probably
be a little annoyed yeah
[Laughter]
i would i would take the hint let's put
it that way and be like uh
i'm offended i guess um it sounds like
there were two people who knew what they
wanted and didn't want to compromise and
then they broke up
all i'm saying is if they flipped the
script
and the wife wasn't making that much
money but the husband was bringing for
home 94k do you think reddit would have
said you're the [ __ ] 50 or do you
think they would have said
you know you're carrying some dead
weight she just wants to leech off of
you and uh you know if she doesn't have
any ambition then then she's the [ __ ]
just throwing that out there just just
just offering
i
i've acknowledged that when you flip the
script sometimes it makes my opinion
look worse i think in this one
you must acknowledge it makes my opinion
look a little bit better
am i the [ __ ] for we can only choose
like one more
am i the [ __ ] for contributing to one
of my children's college funds and not
the others um
i it's come on is
hold on
i'm gonna look at three and choose one i
think that's a great idea
preferring one child to another am i the
[ __ ]
am i the [ __ ] for
calling security on student parties even
though i know they'll be charged for the
disturbance i'm not gonna do this one
because i
can without even reading it i'm like
you're not the [ __ ]
[Laughter]
if they're if they're making noise late
at night you can't sleep then you call
security on them
what do you suppose just just go to work
tired so that they can go
until four in the morning
like come on man you did that [ __ ] yeah
and i got noise complainted like
you know multiple times a year
and then when the cops came and said
please like shut the [ __ ] up
we went this is
[ __ ] man and then when we woke up in
the morning we were like oh yeah
actually that makes perfect sense
i could completely understand why
we in their defense we were being quite
loud
maybe our judgment was somewhat clouded
by some beverages that have been imbibed
come on man they're young and enjoying
their youth
i forgot you can't enjoy like the only
part of being young that's fun is being
like loud as hell uh when people are
trying to sleep
like you couldn't possibly like have fun
without cranking the subwoofer 211 in
like a shared living space and uh you
know keeping the party going all night
insanely loudly you couldn't just
you know
quietly have some conversations with one
another until 6 a.m it's only you know
you don't even have to lie it's always a
good time
i've been on both sides of the noise
complaint
argument i've been noise complaining in
university
deserved it every single time no
question about it
that being said will i noise complain to
other people yeah within reason like if
it's 1001 and they're like you know it's
audible i'm not like knock it off it's
like three in the morning and the thing
is it gets louder too as people get
drunker
which is the most annoying part you
think that like it'll be peak
drunkenness and then over time they'll
be like shh
but actually they just they're they
start they turn the music up and then
they they're like i don't know why we're
listening to the music so loud when we
actually wanted to come here to have a
conversation so then they're shouting
and then somebody's like shut the [ __ ]
up i'm trying to listen to the song and
they crank the music and they're like
i'm just gonna try to keep i need to
keep talking over the din and then it's
like a positive feedback loop that never
ends man
stun locked at three
yeah what about my baby like trying to
enjoy her youth by uh actually getting a
good night's sleep
oh i guess like youth only matters when
you're like between the ages of 17 and
21.
if you're under the age of uh of 12 [ __ ]
you you shouldn't be allowed on an
airplane dummy
am i the [ __ ] for losing a friend
over the use of their full name for a
formal wedding invitation
of the three
i got it i gotta go with the college fun
man
do that one okay fine
i'm just i wanna i wanna
i wanna look at it first
just to make sure okay
just oh my god it's so long
i can't even like summarize it with my
eyes
edit for info edit because people keep
asking edit for more info edit for the
best man thing update
update what the [ __ ]
this just
sucks
this one is not good it's not even like
controversial it's just bad
how about this one am i the [ __ ] for
taking three dollars from my little
sister's room
to tip the pizza guy after dad
accidentally didn't tip online
i noticed my sis usually has cash
sitting in a room because she's a cart
prepper for a hotel and gets tips she's
had it sitting out before but she knows
i'd never steal from her well my dad and
i were frantically searching for cash
around the house house because he
accidentally hit cash and not online tip
i texted her if i could grab a few bucks
for him because it's so crappy to not
tip somebody she didn't respond i didn't
see any at first but there was a wipes
container partially popped open that had
some money in it i took three dollars
and let her know right away that i'd pay
her back she woke up
from her friends this morning and is
going ballistic
saying no one was supposed to find that
money and i said i understand absolutely
go ahead and hide it elsewhere i won't
do it again i didn't want to but i felt
the situation called for it
since he was going to be there soon
closest place to get cash back was 20
minutes away she said she no longer
trust me i crossed the line and i'm
starting to feel like i did a very bad
thing to put it into perspective we were
both living there in our early 20s while
she's school and because i just left an
abusive relationship i didn't think she
would get that mad honestly can i tell
you
not not the [ __ ]
i'm stunned that this is 62 you're the
[ __ ] here
like
this
look i know how this comes across okay
i it's three dollars
like i get that
the principle of it is she had money
that she was storing
and she was hiding it she didn't want
anybody to know that it was there that
we can argue the
philosophy of that
all you want
but like
it was found so
like she can be upset that the money was
found
but it is
three dollars
and i i like i i would do this i think
if somehow i mean i'm just going to tell
you straight out this would never happen
to me because before i submit any form
online i look over it like you know 20
times
uh
regardless okay
if let's say kate was away i ordered a
pizza accidentally hit cash
100
i would i would go through the drawers
if i found the 20 i would pay for the
pizza and then i would i mean i wouldn't
be like you know
gotcha
i would be like
hey i just so you know i took a 20 to
pay the pizza guy and i'll give it back
to you like
literally whenever
would you steal money from your baby
i'm telling you straight up if if my
let's assume i had like a 10 year old
child
if my child was asleep
and they had the only cash in the house
with which to tip the pizza delivery
person i would absolutely steal the
money from my child
there's there's no question
and because
it's like a steal
to fulfill this transaction
and then when they wake up you go hey
just so you know i took like the 10
bucks you had on your dresser to pay for
dinner but i'll give it back to you like
today
absolutely
saving this to send to your daughter in
10 years if i raise her right i think
she would agree with me
but if they're a ten-year-old kid what
are they gonna do
they're not gonna get in the car and
drive to the candy store i'm in complete
control of when they have the capacity
to spend the money
i get that you can't just like logician
your way out of every argument but i'd
be like yeah i borrowed look yes i took
your money what are you gonna do with it
you're gonna you're gonna scan it and
then buy v bucks i don't think so
it's cash dummy is is 2031
where are you going to spend cash
does you know you're going to go
uh
walk to the i don't even know to the
mall i don't even know what 10 year olds
buy honestly but you're going to cry
little little goblin junior
i'm just saying this is part of the the
social contract of a family
if if you stole the money never told her
and then when she found it
like that you denied it or something
that makes you an [ __ ] even if it's
three dollars if an unforeseen situation
came up where you needed the money
it's three dollars
which is like
look i'm oversimplifying but if you're
like i need a thousand dollars to pay
for my car repair and you take
somebody's thousand dollars and don't
have the means to pay it back that's a
different story than
three
dollars
is three dollars
we need reddit's opinion
i am i it is stunning that this is 62
you're the [ __ ]
mr moneybags over here that's not even a
tier one subscription man
update i gave her five dollars and she
forgave me i learned a lot from the
critique i wasn't ever trying to double
down on what i did you did borrow three
dollars it's not that big of a deal
i genuinely wanted to understand her
anger and now i do i was wrong
shut up the internet what have you done
to this this young adult here you got
them they're gonna carry this guilt for
the rest of their life first off you
gave her like a 60
return on the loan
in what two days this is the most
incredible investment that's ever
existed in business history and now you
got them tricked into thinking they're
like a total [ __ ]
that's insanity man let's i
you're both in your early twenties
little your little sisters in though for
some reason reddit can't be reached
retry
oh
just kidding
[Laughter]
you went through your sister's stuff
without permission to take money to tip
for a meal your sister did not eat
wasn't even on the premises when it was
ordered or delivered and you're
wondering if you might be the a yes
absolutely you're the a on every front
making your sister financially
responsible for not her meal knowing you
should get permission but not waiting
until you hear back from her
prioritizing a three dollar tip over her
privacy the list goes on i won't regale
you with all the other stuff that
reflects poorly on you instead i'll just
say the list goes on and then who knows
there could be a thousand things on this
list there could be zero more we'll just
put the difference
hey hey hey uh pizza guy here's way i'm
just waiting for a text from my sister
to see if i can go take the three
dollars that i found in a room you're
cool to hang out here for a literally
indeterminate length of time right could
be uh 10 seconds could be 24 hours
and and hear me out here
when the text comes back if everything's
a-okay you get a juicy
three
dollars right in your pocket man
that's crazy just if look you wouldn't
want me to
it it's
so much this okay sorry
you know she should have texted back
faster
hey take the three bucks but save me a
slice
you're the [ __ ]
regardless of the amount it was her
money
i too
judge every situation exclusively by
uh the principles instead of the reality
of the situation
even if it was a single penny
you are
an [ __ ] for taking your sister's
money
even if you needed one penny
to pay
for medicine that you needed urgently to
survive it's her money you should simply
maintain the moral high ground while
dying
your dad should have been able to call
and have a tip added no response does
not equal permission you're the [ __ ]
okay this is actually true
i still don't think it makes you the
[ __ ]
i'm also gonna go ahead and say
that given the choice of taking an un
vetted three dollar loan temporarily or
trying to phone in a tip to the pizza
place i would take the three dollars
because it's just
so much easier
and to me it seems like the odds of this
situation ever coming
to blows like this is so low
you could have very quickly driven to
the as soon as he made the online order
you could have driven to the pizza place
given your plight to them
added a tip
100 by the way or zero because tips i
forget where reddit falls on tips
let me fix it for you am i the a-hole
for snooping through my sister's stuff
to get her hidden stash of money
yes okay i mean look
for snooping yes it depends okay if
there was a wipes container that was
open and you spotted it no problem
if there was uh
if you had to find it under her bed or
something i do then it makes you kind of
an [ __ ] but
i think it's a removal of context
soft you're the [ __ ]
i'm guessing you also entered her room
without permission to can i just say
like [ __ ] off that's too much okay but
like
you're like in your
20s is your family
you entered my room without my
permission
like just
it's just so minor you're the [ __ ]
you had no respect for your sister if i
was her i would get a lock for the
bedroom
i'm sorry you told her to go ahead and
hide her money elsewhere when you
swooped around about it for the first
time question my question my question my
question my question mark this is like a
40 question mark sequence here you're
the [ __ ] not you trying to wash your
hands of this capital offense that
you've committed if i were you i would
i would probably you're on notice or the
police are looking for you not you
trying to absolve yourself of this
terrible grievance that you've uh
created for your totally cause all
because you wanted a little pizza
you're the [ __ ] you didn't get a
response that didn't give you free reign
to just go steal money from her
even if there was the intent to repay it
and even if it's
three dollars which i think we need to
continue to restate is probably about
the cost of the smallest cup of coffee
that you can get at dunkin donuts i'm
just making sure we're all anchored on
this
you know like in the court system
there is uh
you know
petty theft
grand larceny
uh you know armed robbery like based on
the severity of of what
the crime is
you're treated differently like for
three dollars they i mean i guess you
they're not talking about taking it to
court to begin with but they would
probably be like stop wasting my time
is there i'm just wondering if there's
an amount of money like if if people
made this post about a quarter
would people still be going
you're you're an [ __ ] with 10
question marks at the end it's not about
the money or would that at that point
would they be like
it's it's just a quarter i think it i
think there is an amount of money where
people would be like
okay we shouldn't you shouldn't have
even made that post for a nickel really
you're making the post
i guess three dollars is above the
threshold oh here we go grundl stiltskin
everyone in this thread is freaking out
calling you an [ __ ] lol it was only
three bucks you tried to ask her if it
was okay then when you did take it you
told her up you told her up front and
said you'd pay her back the only thing
i'd have done differently here is i
would have gone and gotten the money to
pay her back right away also maybe she
should have said you were looking around
for any loose cash or change in the
house and saw the opec container that's
why you texted her honestly seems like
there's underlying issues in the
relationship i have a good relationship
with my family and if they needed to
take three bucks or mustache in my room
and paid me back i wouldn't take it all
congratulations um
hold on one

um
you uh breached her privacy prioritize
the three dollar tip over her well-being
the list goes on
38 upvotes it's just three dollars
look dude i'm i'm learning so much i
feel like many people on the subreddit
have never had a relationship with other
people everything is black or white they
have no concept of nuance like yeah by
the dictionary definition
the op did steal but given the context
is it really worth freaking out about i
mean it's three dollars
oh man you're the [ __ ] it's not
really about the fact that it's three
dollars
but
in so many ways
is that not a detail that's germane to
the situation
if it's not about the fact that it's
three dollars hypothetically if you
stole a thousand dollars from her you
would be reacting with the exact same
magnitude
if he stole a thousand dollars would you
be writing the comments saying it's not
about the thousand dollars or would you
be saying you should be in prison it's
literally about the three dollars
on the occasion it would have been
better overall to not tip the driver
source
not the driver
that's is so good people are so dramatic
not the [ __ ] i'm the sibling who
always has cash in my room sometimes if
my mom's in a tight spot where she needs
cash she'll take some and let me know
it's not a big deal you tried to ask
permission but we're short on time you
let her know right away told her you pay
it back i don't see how you betrayed her
trust when she informed when she was
informed as it was happening
i know some families are less close than
others but to be in your 20s living with
your family and throwing a fit because
they borrowed three dollars dot dot dot
dot
you're the [ __ ] the amount doesn't
matter
i love comment deleted by a user it
wouldn't be different whatsoever op
still stole the money
you're the [ __ ] doesn't matter what
your motives were
again not everything has to be similar
to the court system
uh it it doesn't so what what matters
okay the money doesn't matter at all
okay the amount that's stolen has
absolutely no relevance a million
dollars three dollars who cares uh also
it doesn't matter what you were doing
with it if you were doing it for pizza
that's one thing if you were doing it
for uh life-saving medicine that's one
thing if you were doing it to buy v
bucks that's why it's all the same
no one should ever steal money didn't
your parents teach you anything
i live my life by a code
you ever hear only a sith deals in
absolutes you're the [ __ ] you stole
from her and are surprised she doesn't
trust you anymore
he's three
it's three dollars
and
he he gave her five dollars back
i'll say not the [ __ ] because in the
grand scheme of things this isn't a big
deal in fact it would be hard to find
something that's a smaller deal everyone
needs to chill
i definitely think that's fair
on the other hand you're the [ __ ] it
now makes sense why she hides her money
sure you did the right thing by texting
to ask if you could borrow cash the fact
that you got no response would mean no
so you violated her privacy and stole
from her if it was so important to tip
the pizza guy why didn't you phone her
you have broken the law
am i the only one thinking not the
[ __ ] no but we're we're a dying breed
apparently
everyone else is part of the context
collapse
you're the [ __ ] you're the [ __ ]
your sister needs to put her money
someplace else so you don't go in there
and taking it
she knows i'd never steal from her now
she knows for a fact that you would
you're the [ __ ] i'm i'm losing my
mind you're the [ __ ] you technically
stole
i get not tipping is bad but it's not
worse than stealing even if you intended
to pay her back you still stole and you
didn't have permission to touch it are
you telling me you didn't have some
change in your own room even if it was
in coins to make the tip yourself your
your dad also didn't no cash app or
anything you could have handled it with
you're telling me that you thought you
had a close enough relationship with
your sister because you've grown up
together for 20 years that you could
borrow the sum of a small cup of coffee
from her pay her back before she even
returned home and have her not get upset
about it are you [ __ ] stupid
you touched her piece of paper that
symbolizes that she can give this to a
person at a store
and in return she can get an eight ounce
cup of brown liquid
even if you give her the three dollars
back it's not the same three dollars
you must be brain dead they're distinct
pieces of paper
it's not about the money
it's not about what you were gonna do
with it
it has absolutely nothing to do with any
of those things that clearly make this
apparent to any normal person that this
is not a big deal what it is instead is
a very black and white issue
are you pro-grand larceny
or are you
a moral person
personally as a redditor i see myself as
a moral person i would never steal
anything uh except every hollywood movie
and television program that's ever come
out but that's different that's
different stealing quotation marks my
mistake
if it were me i'd like to think i'd be
annoyed but understanding if i got paid
back since i used to work as a server i
understand people survive on their tips
that being said i get not tipping is bad
but it's not worse than stealing
especially uh when you completely
collapse the nuance of the situation
i get that not tipping is bad but it's
not worse than stealing three dollars
from your sister and then paying her
back in a day um anyway i understand why
your sister's angry
source dude just trust me anyway that's
react court um



hey everybody it's been a while welcome
back uh to react court we're actually
sorted by the top posts of the month
right now would you look at that
because it's been since labor day
at least well since the week before
labor day
when i was able to uh to do some react
court last week
i naively thought
after a lifetime of not really
interfacing much with triple a games i
thought the death loop would change that
for
me the week before that was labor day i
took that time off
so we're back here
um
i'm not insulting death loop okay i'm
i'm not trying to
i'm not trying to be rude okay let's
take a look at this i'm happy to be back

okay
am i the [ __ ] for calling the police
on my flatmate kid knocking on my door
this is one of those times i believe i
need a british or australian translator
a mate is a friend
a flat is an apartment
what is a flatmate kid it's a friend of
yours who's two dimensional it's a
roommate's oh i'm my roommate's child i
was making a joke i thought maybe this
was someone in their apartment complex
that was like knocking on their door
it's their roommate's child okay
let's check it out am i the [ __ ] for
calling the police on my flatmate kid
disclaimer not in the usa
not in the usa
i f22 live in a shared house with the
landlord and his two sons and a woman
and her daughter
is it
by any chance uh
do they all have hair of gold
like their mother the youngest one in
curls
this is a joke about the brady bunch i
apologize
yesterday the landlord plus his kids
were away visiting some family and the
other woman works a crazy schedule i was
sleeping in my room when i woke up by
the kids screaming like crazy at about
2am i figured the mother was not home so
i put on my headphones but in a few
minutes she was banging on my door still
screaming and crying okay let's start
that sucks that sucks that's not a nice
situation that's a bit of a toxic living
situation
i panicked thinking something horrible
was going on outside so i shut myself in
my room's bathroom and called the police
they could hear the screaming on the
call so they came very quickly all right
that is
probably what i would describe as a
little bit of an overreaction
an eight-year-old child that you are
familiar with is screaming and banging
on your door your response was to lock
yourself in the bathroom and call the
police
i do i mean
so you
i'm not trying to argue because this is
like a self-driving car situation but
it's like you know
i'm not saying you have to give up
your life to protect your landlord's
child
all i'm saying is
you are the steward of the child safety
of the situation whether you should be
there or not the fact that you got so
scared of the situation they were in you
locked yourself in the bathroom and
called the police is at the very least a
little funny it's a little a little
humorous
um they heard the screaming so they came
very quickly turns out the kid had a
nightmare and was really scared and the
paramedics had to put some medicine in
her to calm her down then the police
asked me a lot of questions and i
explained our living situation did i
know where the mother was i told them i
was not aware the kid was alone because
the mother has a crazy schedule i
provided her phone number but they
couldn't reach her so they took the kid
to the police station
i went back to sleep and woke up by the
mother banging on my door and screaming
at me for what happened yesterday she
said the police won't give her daughter
back and i'm an [ __ ] for calling them
for something as silly as a nightmare i
should have just calmed the kid down
instead of making it a huge deal
i told her it's not my responsibility to
take care of her daughter i barely
interact with any of them and i was not
going to open my door to someone
screaming like crazy because it could be
dangerous i think it was the right
choice to call the police but i told the
situation to my mother and she says
either way i should have checked on the
kid because sharing a house also means
helping out with this kind of thing
okay um this story is
is sad
but
uh also
kind of i i can't get over
her hearing a kid screaming and then
just going to the bathroom with their
headphones in and being like
uh toby maguire i miss the part where
that's my problem let me just say first
it this definitely seems like i don't
know if i would feel comfortable saying
everybody sucks here but uh
this situation sucks for everybody here
can we flip that script around
there's
one two three four five there's six
people living in this house
that range from eight
to
old enough to have two sons
oh well i i you know
likely
it's just
it's a bit of a strange situation okay
one family a landlord and two sons a
woman and her daughter and then just one
random unrelated
22 year old
that's just a very unusual living
situation i feel like
you don't see too much
it seems like this this person is
already put in a toxic spot and i have
some sympathy for them for that um hey
mercy thank you thank you
i guess i mean look
i don't know what to say
about this one do i think that this
person
uh
did what they should have done in that
situation no
you if you hear
an eight-year-old child screaming
like i kind of feel like even if it's a
stranger's child
the adult thing to do is be like hey
what's wrong and if you get killed you
just kind of hope that there's like a
heaven because whatever you've done in
your life
sacrificing your life to like make sure
that a child is safe it would get you
through the pearly gates imo
and then if the then you could just
haunt the person who killed you if
that's how it happened but if it's
somebody you know
especially i think that's like an extra
obligation right like i'm not saying
this person is taking like the ultra
libertarian approach of like sorry
sister you're eight years old and your
mom went to work now you enjoy being
self-reliant i'm not saying that they're
taking that opinion i'm just saying
you know i i think that when you have a
an awareness of this child when they're
a part of your life you have more of a
if not an obligation at least more of an
incentive to be like hey you know what's
going on
like at least talk to the kid through
the door or something i wouldn't want to
be in this situation either is very
uncomfortable
um
that being said
i don't think i'm comfortable saying
that they're an [ __ ] for this
i mean i feel like this is one of those
things you ever hear the expression that
[ __ ] rolls downhill like if we're trying
to track
[ __ ] zero the first [ __ ] that made
everything else shitty
you gotta go like a a a ways up the
situation here right this person that
called the police i don't think they
took the first [ __ ] so who took the
first [ __ ] well oh the mom's got weird
hours and that makes it uh impossible
for her to be there for her kid okay but
her mom
probably didn't willfully take this
position that has weird hours you know
so like how the heck did this happen and
all of a sudden you're going back to
like you know
adam smith or something like that you're
going back to like the dawn of modern
economics you're going back to the the
first caveman who exchanged like some
some nuts for some meats like i don't
know how far back you're going here um
i i would say
here's what i would say okay this is a
new one for me we're starting we're
starting a positive situation like this
is this is novel
it's and everyone sucks here but i also
think you're not the [ __ ] for sucking
because this just seems like a a chaotic
situation
where people are going to act in an
unpredictable fashion
so i think op acted in a strange fashion
in a fashion that was
somewhat inappropriate but also
understandable given the amount of chaos
that's afoot here
we go this is one of the most divided
posts i've ever seen
40 not the [ __ ] 32 percent you're the
[ __ ] 25 everybody sucks here
that's like
that's almost one-third one-third
one-third that's crazy
let me let me see what's going on here
i my if i had to read
like a redditer through my mind with esp
in advance
um
i
guarantee like this is uh top post is
why wasn't the mom there it's the mom's
responsibility
i find it odd your immediate response to
hearing a crying child is to lock
yourself up and call the police without
even attempting to check on the child
yeah it's not your kid and not your
responsibility and the mother obviously
shouldn't have left your child home
alone but damn that's some really
selfish behavior
i want to say you're the [ __ ] but i
have to lean more towards everybody
sucks here mother's in the wrong for
leaving your kids solo but you're
definitely wrong for not even checking
on the kid and taking care of yourself
based
you are this is a based
result
user received gold for this post up
votes really
for all those saying
oh wait what the heck for all those
saying they used crying kids to trap
women for sex trafficking op literally
said it's a shared house that they all
live in and she knew it was her
roommate's kid is that true
that's the kind of stuff look i that's
the kind of stuff i don't mean to be
rude but like my grandma posted on on
facebook
she she'll post something that's like if
you
see duct tape on your car door handle
run in the opposite direction it's a
common human trafficking scam where
while you rip the duct tape off your
door handle they grab you and and take
you away
it happens all the time and i'm like
grandma come on that's not gonna go down
at the cataract way town center
come on
i mean i'm not saying it's never
happened
all i'm saying is is it's not happening
like outside of the moxie's on gardner's
road okay
plus i would just if you put duct tape
on my door it wouldn't matter to me
because the bugatti veyron doors are
actually um they're they're gull wings
so i don't have to use the the handle i
have keyless entry and then they go funk
anybody tries to human traffic me
they're getting uppercutted by the
bugatti door
anyway um i mean this is just this is
not an insane it's an insane story in
the way that they reacted but it's more
like i can't put myself in their shoes
right if i lived in
uh let's call it like you know like a a
duplex environment and i heard a child
screaming
and it was my neighbor's kid
i would go and be like hey what's wrong
because
that i'm the the responsibility is
inherited by me in that situation
if i was 22 years old and i lived with
um my landlord and their two kids and
then a random lady and her kid as well
and then it was two in the morning and i
went i just heard ah
i i probably wouldn't have uh
locked myself in the bathroom i think i
would have i would have tweeted first i
would have been like check this out what
if i if i die please avenge me twitter
um but
i can understand that if i put myself in
her shoes i might react in a different
way because this seems like a very
chaotic situation
so more power
more power to her i guess
but it sucks i mean really like it sucks
for the kid man
she can't get her kid back from the
police yeah but that like okay that's
not really like um
the 22 year olds faults
that's kind of like the police
the police's fault
or like i
like toby mcguire i miss the part where
that's my problem
like it's that's between the police and
the mom as far as i'm concerned like i
think if you
uh
are like hey the cops won't give me my
kid back and it's your fault cause you
called them there's like a self report
in there
that is like hey thanks for calling the
police on my negligence
now as a result of you ratting on my
negligence i'm facing punishment for my
actions
but anyway the timeouts
it all it happens every time
it's just like it's the classic uh i
don't even know what they said i'm not
like
going in on them i'm just saying it
that's what happens oh i know what it is
yeah yeah it's the filter okay it's not
mods it's the filter
okay we're going back here
we're going back
interesting start a lot of [ __ ] ones
right off the bat oh man
i'm just scrolling down a little check
this out am i the [ __ ] for telling my
stepson's bumble date that she should
focus on her career and children rather
than dating men like my stepson
[Laughter]
oh man
oh it's been a good month huh
for my whole life i never okay sorry am
i the [ __ ] for freaking out at my mom
after finding out who my biological
father is for my whole life i never knew
who my biological father was my mom and
family have always been super secret
recently my mom decided to tell me as i
just turned 16 and she felt i was old
enough to know
she sat me down in the living room and
told me my bio dad was her ex stepfather
aka my grandmother and her ex-husband
my my my aka my grandmother's ex-husband
my grandmother's ex-husband is my dad
i need i'm just picturing it in a
diagram form okay
i felt extremely disgusted and
disappointed and said
why no wonder grandma hates being around
you you couldn't keep your legs closed
long enough to keep away from grandma's
husband
look this can't be real
i
i believe that this story could take
place
but there is no way
that as soon as she heard the news she
just owned her mom like that there's no
chance
i do i don't believe
that you would just lie and then again
it is that's the 16 year old
uh stereotype is just lighting people up
but
i'm completely disgusted with you i said
a lot of other stuff i wasn't really
kind with my words my mom cried i'm
really sorry my actions ended up hurting
a lot of people it's something i live
with every day just know that my actions
don't define you i told my mom to save
her words i never thought in a million
years this would be the outcome
okay i mean
the way my grandma acts around me how
the only times i ever go to her house or
on holidays when my younger siblings go
to her house a lot more
i mean this is just a sad story
i
i'm just leaving
i'm just i don't believe it necessarily
to begin with but i'm also just like i
don't want to touch this with a 10-foot
pole
that's just
that's just a disaster
uh
there's some great ones here man
am i the [ __ ] for telling my wife not
to clean so angrily
oh man
interesting start so far am i the
[ __ ] for telling my stepson's bumble
date that she should focus on her career
rather than children rather than dating
men like my stepson
i think this is just like a rule of
thumb this is a heuristic anytime
uh you tell
a woman at all and i guess a man but i
feel like it happens a lot less often
but any time you tell a woman to
hurry up and have kids you're really
going to be
operating from behind the eight ball
uh when it comes to being on the moral
high grounds
i think that that you know that's very
personal
business
oh
if she already has kids then well maybe
let's let's read through maybe let's
just read then
for context my 36 year old steps oh my
this person is 36 they got a 19 year old
stepson i was i don't know who to relate
to
i'm i'm okay i guess i'm like basically
the same age as the dad
all right
my stepson lives at home with my wife
and i
last weekend i found a woman in my
living room
after i woke up in the morning she had
slept over in my step-son's room my
step-son was still asleep he normally
sleeps in late on the weekends when i
first came downstairs she was crying on
the phone i proceeded to introduce
myself
hello there
i just didn't picture that
hello uh
welcome to my home
uh i proceeded to introduce myself she
said she was on the phone with her
mother who was taking care of her son
while she was staying over with my
stepson i proceeded to ask if she knew
my stepson through his job and she said
they met through bumble
sorry they met online bumble
we talked a bit more and due to reasons
i will explain i ultimately told her
that she should not be prioritizing
dating especially men like my stepson
and should instead focus on her career
and spending more time with her son
here's the thing
my stepson has been living with my wife
and i since he graduated high school
over a year ago he's handsome tall and
in shape due to his full-time work as a
swimming instructor and lifeguard [ __ ]
[ __ ] [ __ ]
[ __ ]
sexy
dick bag
chad
just picture him his tight red shorts
and his
his glistening body given those swimming
lessons
that's not me putting on a character by
the way i'm mad
since he graduated he has brought
numerous women over to our house at
least 20 but i have lost count now and
not always aware due to working sporadic
hours
good good for him
i guess at first my wife and i were
surprised about how he was meeting them
he barely has enough time to date and
uses most of his free time in his room
playing video games when we confronted
him about it he said he just uses online
dating to set up dates and brings them
to our house or drives to them
why do you this is just a
a simple question i guess from somebody
that exists
in between 36 year old dad and 19 year
old stepson
why do you need to confront your stepson
for this this is not no no no this is
not as bad
as
security camera dad who was like you
can't if you don't get home by 11 just
sleep on the street this dad just seems
like
i mean maybe a little curious
i just don't understand why you got to
confront your son for going on a lot of
dates or you know let's be honest just
making your basement sound like animal
planet three or four times a week oh
okay hold on last year he had two
pregnancy scares which he handled
himself something something tells me
that there may have been another person
involved in these pregnancy scares but
that maybe that's just my
my theory uh furthermore a few months
ago i noticed he kept bringing back two
different women to our house in
alternation
although i've always been a monogamous
monogamous long-term relationship type
of guy i understand the whole gist the
young men sew in their wild oats my wife
doesn't seem to mind as long as it's
safe however i feel like my stepson
might not be being completely
transparent with his dates and i
currently believe he's not a good
candidate for young single mothers you
got to get a hobby my man that's just
crazy
what do you want to be like his
administrative assistant
like we know when you go into a doctor's
office you got to like fill out a form
and do an interview with the
the front desk about why you're there
it's like you know hey
welcome to my son's uh bedroom before if
you could just take a seat right there
he'll be right with you first i just
want you to know he does tend to bring
back women in an alternating fashion um
i do need to ask about you personally do
you have any children what are your
career plans etc etc
am i in the wrong for interjecting and
diverting this young single mother away
from her current situation with my
stepson i believe that her son will
greatly benefit from her taking a break
with dating and spending more time with
him
it's just like
it's just none of your business this you
are you are the [ __ ]
for sure it's not that big of a deal
like you're not a a turbo [ __ ] but
just like chill out
like it's not you're you're not the
person who controls everybody else's
life and decisions you know just let
them let them live their lives you can
give advice but
you you working as this weird like
arbitrator of
how people should spend their time is
very strange to clarify i would the big
weirdo energy i will admit i have a
protective urge when it comes to single
mothers
tell me you don't have like a
a t-shirt that says like
i don't even want to make it up but
[Laughter]
so if you mess with the queen you have
to deal with the king's army or
something like that
um
okay so his wife has been in therapy due
to abusive relationships this it's fair
while i'm not saying my stepson is
abusive i do not believe that the
hook-up culture he's engaging in is
healthy for a young single mother with
her whole future ahead of ahead of her
children and career come first in my
opinion
this i i feel like a lot of people
uh run into this uh
confluence of confusion
you can have an opinion that's no
problem
it's when you start to
not just tell it to other people but act
like you're coming from on high with
this like advice plus like dude just
you're 36.
i like i don't know if if you are of the
opinion that makes you some grand old uh
sage or something like that you're still
like
basically a little kid it's actually
kind of you and your child are basically
peers
you're
not yet but in like 10 years you're
going to be the same age
which is a you know something to keep in
perspective
you're in no position like if it was
like an 80 year old grandma or something
like that and she's like here's my
advice you would be like first off she's
coming from a place of a lot of lived
experience but also secondarily like
you know
whatever grandma go go back and watch
live with michael strahan or whatever
who's even on live with regis and kelly
now um
you just gotta
you know you can there's a difference
between having an opinion and my opinion
is is kind of for the record she can do
whatever she wants but i also i'm like
when do you have your you're a single
mom i'm not saying you can't have any
fun well i know you know i was gonna say
i i agree with him a little but i
actually don't there's you know you you
can go out and have some fun if you have
your child being handled responsibly by
a babysitter it doesn't he he has an
assumption i guess in this post that is
like she's going out all the time
and getting
you know railed by random lifeguards and
being an irresponsible
parent
most of the
railing is probably happening
past the child's bedtime anyway
there's no reason that those things
can't be
uh compatible with one another in a
24-hour day
it just seems like you could fit both of
them in responsibly and still be like a
good parent
anyway yeah you're you're the [ __ ]
i've the more i talk about it the more
i'm like it's just weird that you
this seems like the kind of guy he
becomes like the he's dwight schrute
right like he's he's dwight schrute and
his son is jim halpert and now he
michael scott is allowing him to have
the smallest modicum of power
over his son and he's like
are you sure you should be doing all
that [ __ ] like it's just
it's just weird
don't date my son if you want a
long-term relationship okay great very
honest
don't date at all be a mother you're the
[ __ ] that's definitely true
okay yeah we i know i know user received
gold for this post shooting stars reddit
silver up dudes really
you're the [ __ ] who are you to assume
she doesn't spend enough time with her
son because she spent a single night at
someone else's absolutely true yes
you're the [ __ ] single mothers are
allowed to date and even have one night
stance you want to warn her that your
stepson is a freak boy go right ahead
that's true yeah
you could be like hey my stepson's kind
of a piece of garbage it makes you kind
of an [ __ ]
instead of
doing that you're like uh you know you
should be a better mom that's a little
not not the [ __ ] but situations like
this
oh no it's the
it's the the realtor
not you're not the [ __ ] uh sores dude
just trust me
but situations like this are beyond
uncomfortable if i were you i would not
let the stepson bring flings over
look okay
he's 19 years old in the economic
reality
of 2021 is very different than it was in
like 19
you know 52 okay
in 1952
the
window of time where somebody
was capable of making an informed
decision about copulating
and also the window of which they were
able to
maybe get their own property or at least
like move out on their own there was
probably like a
it's a narrow window of a couple of
years nowadays people are you know with
real estate prices so insane rent's so
insane
covered to begin with i mean covet broke
out when this guy was like 17 years old
maybe you know you kids are not going to
be leaving home until they're in their
mid-20s maybe later you got to come up
with some kind of uh situation like some
kind of agreement in the in the hotel of
mom and dad
to allow this stuff to happen otherwise
i think you're just being kind of
ignorant at this point
like it's gonna happen
this is a
like south korea which is like the only
other country i'm familiar with has the
same thing going on where like you're
not supposed to uh stay over with your
boyfriend or girlfriend until you're
married but that's like not realistic so
instead they go out to like uh
karaoke rooms you know dvd bongs which
is like where you go and watch a movie
and then you just do it in there and
then some poor
like minimum wage staff has to clean up
your stain instead of the way god
intended which is that your mom finds it
when she washes your sheets four days
later like
just get over it
it's just it's just
the the idea that you would be like you
can't bring
prospective romantic partners over
is just like complete denialism to me at
least
i don't understand
big plus two oh thank you thank you i it
felt
it felt good when the metal straw hits
oh man
oh
you're the [ __ ] um you're the [ __ ]
i know i want to see some psychos man
you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ]
why was she crying also you're the
[ __ ] you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ]
info okay yeah no that's fair
um
oof you're the [ __ ]
i'm
i i just hate to
this is a
flashpoint issue that causes a lot of
disagreement which is fine okay this is
a safe place to disagree
but i am always surprised at the amount
of people who are like if it makes you
uncomfortable ask him to keep it out of
the house and then somebody else replies
this is the best comment if op's
uncomfortable with his son bringing
strangers into the home he needs to take
it up with him not the strangers
the the his house his rules stuff like i
do get it and
i i just disagree when it's like your
child
i'm not saying that your child should be
allowed to like do arson in the home or
you know consistently bring home sketchy
strangers who like rob you but
it's
so why is so much of am i the [ __ ]
like disputes about real estate as if
like you're the king of the castle
instead of situations that are like
you know everybody in this house has to
live
under one roof we've all got a you know
that that's that's what it's like to
live with other people in in castle
ravani exactly
you do some [ __ ] i guarantee you that
annoys the hell out of your son okay
you probably mow the lawn at like 7 40
a.m on a sunday or something like that
but you just get to go you know my house
my rules and then your son doesn't even
he's not even causing you any problems
based on your post he's just you know
laying pipe and maybe you're a little
bit jealous or something like that and
now you're you're you're blowing up his
spot constantly and then all not only
blowing up his spot but then telling his
romantic partners to be better mothers
like it's
everybody's gotta
get along in these situations why is it
always like well my name's on the deed
so i will enforce my will on this
domicile like just
don't homeowners don't be
like weird tyrants 2021 challenge
i mean i pay the mortgage i get my way
in my own house like 20 percent of the
time
i'm thankful for it
i just i'm i'm just out here trying to
survive man
[Laughter]
you'd be fine if your daughter in 19
years brought back the whole band of
nickelback look it's easy to say in
principle
we could not make that it there would be
a space problem it wouldn't be on
immoral grounds or or taste or anything
like that we just we don't live in a
place that's large enough to sustain
what like what would at that point be
eight adults
when you include my family this place
cannot fit eight people
you could do it like one at a time
maybe over the course of a week
do some kind of rotation or something
like that but not simultaneously it's
not like a a permission thing it's more
that like i don't
want to have to like ask chad kroger to
like oh no i'm going that way hey chad i
know you're standing in front of the
fridge like doing a text but like i need
to move i need to get some water from
the fridge right like
cut his mic cut his mic
okay
am i the [ __ ] for asking my wife not
to clean so angrily
i love this
i love this because i i think that i've
i can relate already and i i love it
even more because he has been judged in
the way that i judge myself
oh
this is a recurring issue that happens
regularly often leads to fights last
night it happened again my wife is a bit
of a neat freak her cleaning standards
are definitely higher than mine i've
tried to adapt and clean more often it's
not a problem for me i don't mind
cleaning most of the time the issue is
that it's hard to predict when messes
will set her off and send her into a
spiral of angry cleaning
here's what happened yesterday we got
back from a trip to costco we're both
exhausted i unload the car and put the
perishables away before i leave
everything before but i leave everything
else out to take care of later then i go
to decompress and play video games
before bed all right let me tell you
brother we were we
take it from a wise old sage at age 32.
everything up to this point
you have some defensibility
you've got a
you've got a lot of sympathy however as
soon as you and i under i know what
you're gonna say in response to this
because i have the conversation with
myself okay
when you're putting the groceries away
you gotta do the whole thing okay
you can't because because it's a shot
along the bow to put half of the
groceries away and leave the other half
out because what you're saying basically
is i've already done enough it's your
time now to do this other 50
the way that this
accounting the credits and the debits of
household work do in a married household
is that
you put you do the whole chore and then
you mentally keep track of it and you go
i put the groceries away i did the whole
thing i get one short credit and then
you have discussions about how to
exchange those credits and settle the
accounts later if
like th
here's the thing if my wife was like we
need to vacuum and mop this weekend
and then
she did half of the vacuuming at her own
convenience and then knocked on my
office door and gave me the vacuum and
was like your turn i would be upset
because i'm like i
basically you're saying like you chose
when it gets done and then you're
forcing me to do it when you want me to
do it instead
you vacuum everything and then later you
go hey i vacuumed you can mop now and i
mop when it fits nicely into my day
otherwise because if you leave half of
the groceries out
you did half of a chore but you also
left a mess when you didn't have to
you you
instead of
making the place clean which like which
is the goal for a neat person
you left the place messy in order for
the chores to be done in an equitable
fashion which is like putting the cart
before the horse and i say that as
somebody who's been there many times
i know everyone's like capitalist
marriage sounds exhausting tell me you
got 25 yellow mcdonald's paper fillet of
fish wrappers on your office uh or
bedroom floor without telling me
tell me you got a bunch of uh empty
soda bottles on your floor without
telling me you got a bunch of empty soda
bottles on your floor
i have 10 empty water bottles in my room
oh man
not me it's maybe like three or four um
but i leave everything else out to take
care of later then i go to decompress
and play video games before bed look i'm
not policing his enjoyment but sometimes
i do this too i'm like oh i'm so tired i
just need to play some video games
before bed just to relax then i'm on
rocket league like wow wow wow wow wow
nice shot nice shot wow what a save wow
sorry honey i can't i can't do the
chores i'm just decompressing wow wow
um anyway
the thing that set my wife off was a
moldy piece of fruit on the count on the
counter understood
it's a caffeine burp i apologize
understandable it's gross
it should just be thrown away right
it's not so simple
something tells me that this runs a
little deeper than they had originally
alluded to my wife gardens and she hates
just throwing things away she has
several different compost bins
and she likes to save fruit seeds to
grow them she's gotten upset with me
before for throwing away old fruit she
was saving for something so i hadn't
thrown away this piece of fruit that she
put there because i wanted to check with
her to see what she wanted to do with it
so she goes to the kitchen for something
sees the moldy fruit in the boxes and
decides the kitchen is a mess she starts
to angry clean i can hear her in the
living room huffing and puffing and
slamming things i feel like an [ __ ]
because now i'm playing video games
while my exhausted wife cleans the whole
kitchen but i really wanted to just
relax go to bed and take care of
everything the next day anyway i suck it
up go to the kitchen to try to convince
my wife to just go to bed and let me
clean everything i tell her basically
that it's really stressful when she
angry cleans and i think she needs a
better way to manage her anger
the best the best laid plans of mice and
men
she gets more upset and we have our
standard fight am i the [ __ ] here i
feel like it's reasonable to point out
how the way my wife copes with stress
and anger doesn't ever seem to make her
less stressed and angry and when she
radiates anger when she's upset it's
really stressful to be around her okay
like
i get that is frustrating
like genuinely
but
i think you gotta have like you gotta
put yourself in her shoes for like
at least five seconds and be like you
like it you're you're wired in a certain
way you want things to always be clean
and tidy they're not clean and tidy and
it seems like it's because your husband
was like
i can just put away this stuff tomorrow
i'm gonna go play some video games which
is true like you could still put him
away tomorrow don't get me wrong but you
could also just not up for like five
seconds and put him away then and then
play the video games
five minutes later okay
but then notwithstanding
like
you're so she if you put yourself in her
shoes right she's
mad that she has to put some extra stuff
away she's she's mad that it's unclean
so she starts to clean herself
by the way and i can't say this for
certain
but i'm going to imagine that maybe she
is passive aggressively cleaning a
little bit
and making more noise than you know it
would be necessary
but i would also wouldn't be surprised
if it's a little bit of the husband's
guilt
manifesting itself as like when she
makes noise
while cleaning it's because she wants me
to feel bad that i didn't do the thing
that deep down i know that i probably
should have done to begin with so maybe
there's a and i'm this i'm putting my
own projection on there's a little bit
of column a and a little bit of column b
is my expectation
but either way
the wrong time
to be like hey honey
i don't think it's healthy
for
you to get your
anger out by doing cleaning the wrong
time to bring that up is when she's in
the middle of cleaning
because like like it or not i'm not
saying this is fair
but if your
way of decompressing from stress
is cleaning you have a huge moral high
ground
what are people going to be like oh stop
blowing off steam making the dishes
[ __ ] and span
like that's you you really need to come
at that situation from a delicate
situation from a delicate position
um because of the fact that she's
basically doing
combined household labor as a way of
getting her stress out so she's gonna be
like probably a little bit annoyed with
you that she felt like she had to clean
but at the same time you it's like
telling someone who's who's
already a little upset to calm down
right it's like you can't
expect that to work it's just like
throwing gasoline onto the fire
but also i know that this like
we're getting back into like the
capitalist marriage lamar point but like
you gotta just put the groceries away
i do that myself all the time
like i i rationalize it myself because
my wife and i have different
standards of cleanliness
and over time
i've slowly
moved in her direction but it's like
it's a learning process and it happens
through habit like ins there were times
when i was like a bachelor i would do
the same thing you get home from the
grocery store you put your ice cream in
the freezer you leave the other
groceries on your counter
for like
a week who cares and then you rather
than take two minutes to put the the
groceries away you'd rather get in like
a 15 minute argument about it right oh
sure let me waste all my time moving the
crackers from the counter to the cabinet
where then when i want them i'll take
them from the cabinet and then put it on
the counter that seems like a really
good use of my time but then like when
you get older you're like i'm just gonna
do it because it like looks nice
it's just like it's the right thing to
do it looks tidy like is the point of
there's like a fundamental
psychological difference i think between
neat people and dirty people let's not
say dirty even though i can't count
myself in that group let's say
untidy
use whatever word you want to use for it
okay
i
look at chores as a list of things that
have to be done
if i vacuum on sunday
and then i see cat hair on monday my
brain goes
i'll get it next sunday right i vacuumed
yesterday i'm not gonna vacuum again
you know the point of
of
vacuuming is is so that i can get it
done and then like live my life
neat people on the other hand see
cleanliness or tidiness as an ideal
state to be maintained
as much as is conceivably possible
without compromising your quality of
life too much
and that it's the the fundamental
conflict i think comes from those two
people
or
that those two differences in opinion
like for me
and
i'm speaking frankly here i vacuumed
yesterday
sometimes like i'll vacuum on a sunday
and then i'll hear the vacuum going
on monday and i'm like my first thought
is like why the hell did i even vacuum
yesterday
if kate's just gonna vacuum today like i
could have saved 20 minutes by not
vacuuming yesterday if she's gonna
vacuum today but then her
like
viewpoint of this situation is
now that like the vacuuming has been
done everything is clean it only takes a
little bit of extra effort to keep
things clean when i see cat hair i'll
just vacuum it up and it takes 10
minutes
you know it's just differences in
opinion
what you should not do is you know
go to
[Laughter]
first off go to reddit but then also
like
i don't know like
in the when she's in the middle of
cleaning to be like
why please stop cleaning
that this is not the right time to bring
that up
you gotta know you're getting into
a disastrous bit of territory there
also like
i don't know like there's a i i am not
like an alpha male i do not impose my
will
uh in this household very often but
there is a part of me that's like
you gotta at least like grow a little
bit of a backbone
for for your marriages sake in this
situation
like it's not so simple to just throw
out a moldy piece of fruit my wife
gardens and she hates just throwing
things away she likes to save fruit
seeds to grow them she's gotten upset at
me before for throwing away old fruit
she was saving for something okay that's
where you gotta say like
are you really mad at me for throwing
away this moldy ass apricot
like you at that point you gotta
you gotta be like this is garbage
if you want it do something with it
otherwise i'm gonna continue to throw
away stuff that's obviously gone bad you
gotta at least stand up to for yourself
a little bit in a situation like this
also like okay i threw out your apricot
i'll just go to the store and get you
another apricot and let it go bad like
big deal
you just gotta talk it out man like
that's kind of crazy or yeah it takes
two seconds to be like hey do you want
these seeds
anyway
look i can relate to this guy but he is
definitely the [ __ ]
this is
just because i can see myself in the
post doesn't mean he's not the [ __ ]
in this situation um i would also i
think this is one of those things where
when you read it from his perspective
you're like it seems like you might be
the [ __ ] but also simultaneously i
can understand where you're coming from
i bet if you heard it from her
perspective
he would wither like uh like a freaking
raisin man i bet her perspective is like
my
lazy ass
husband we got home from costco we're
both tired i went to clean the bathrooms
he put away half of the groceries which
took like 30 seconds and then i saw him
playing rocket league on on the pc
with like eight bags of groceries from
costco just staring me in the face so
obviously i got upset
because things were messy and then i
went to tidy and he was like oh don't
tidy it makes me feel bad because i it
makes me feel like i didn't do my part
you know it's like
again
i'm the
i'm the op basically
just saying
omg stop cleaning lull
i'm just saying you gotta
if you read it from her perspective i
bet that this reads a little bit less
generously um
but i gotta i gotta see how this looks
man i gotta see how this looks
neither one of you are [ __ ] but you
suck at communicating yeah yeah okay
you're a normal person congratulations
dude if you would have just said to your
wife
hey i'm gonna put that stuff away
tomorrow and go on wine before bed that
cool with you oh and hey about that
piece of fruit right there or if she
would have said hey can you pause and
help me finish up the kitchen so i can
relax by not having a [ __ ] up kitchen
then this [ __ ] would not have escalated
but you both screwed up by not talking
to each other
yeah it seems fair
where's where's op
i
this is just i if i if react court could
have like one lesson
it would really from my perspective it
would be
you need to recognize that just because
the person wrote the account that
doesn't mean you have all the
information in like both perspectives
it's like i hate when people write this
the problem is people usually get to the
point of op's wife when talking doesn't
work like you don't you don't know that
there's like 6 billion people
on the seven billion people on the
planet like there's a lot of people are
uniquely weird in their own ways like
you you read like
three paragraphs and you're like i've
met this person in my real life i know
exactly what you're talking about like
just just chill man
anyway um
oh i angry clean i angry clean because
we've had the conversation multiple
times the conversation about doing an
equal load the conversation about how
i'd also prefer to rest when i get in or
get up the conversation about doing
these tasks when they need to be done
and how it makes both our lives better i
angry clean because it solves the
immediate problem and maybe when i get a
chance to rest i can think about having
the conversation again you're the
[ __ ]
i told you that it would look different
from the wife's perspective
so if a non-perishable if it's a
non-perishable when does it need to get
put away if it's just in your head that
it has to be done right away you can't
be mad at someone else about that the
fact is you want it put away
right away i live in a in a cube
i eat all my meals off of a paper towel
on the floor
why is the society tells you you need
tables and chairs cabinets and cupboards
nah drawers are you crazy i leave
everything
easily out laid in a 16 by 16 grid on
the floor i know exactly where
everything is
and every time why leave stuff on the
counter why not just complete the task
not everyone has the energy to just yet
honey
look i chad i don't want to be like
canceled for this okay
i'm not suggesting mental illness
doesn't exist merely that in any post
whenever anybody has any
like piece of bad behavior it's just the
timer until it gets uh
attributed to something that they can't
control
it's never like i don't want to do this
thing and even that's okay if i would
just talk about it it's always like
actually
not everyone has the energy to just do
it i don't know op or his situation
why not just complete the task
op
i don't know op or his situation but
anyway
sorry that's just it's just twitter
poisoning
uh
you know you make like a joke and then
somebody's like well actually maybe the
people at best buy couldn't stock the
shelves because they're depressed and
i'm like i'm not
trying to insult the people who work at
best buy i was merely making a joke
about the system's design of the online
pickup order system okay i didn't want
it didn't have to go and had direction
am i the [ __ ] for
hold on hold on we could put a slash
marker here excuse me
slash marker react court one



am i the [ __ ] for refusing to let my
wife name our daughter ever winter rain
this is an interesting
title huh because
that is a bad name
and as a result
i don't know if you could be the [ __ ]
in that situation
you have saved your
your daughter from
probably getting her name changed
legally at some point but
okay let's
my wife and i are expecting a daughter
we already have a son who is two years
old look can i say something that's over
the line
i'm gonna do it and then i'm gonna
apologize okay
you wanna name your daughter ever winter
rain
tell me you don't believe vaccines work
without telling me you don't believe
vaccines work i'm sorry
i'm sorry
twit longer i would like to say
when i suggested that if you named your
daughter ever winter rain you were an
anti-vaxxer i was merely trying to be
humorous i was not trying to insinuate
that a super cool name like that
indicates
science denialism
i was just trying to make people laugh
but i realized that maybe i crossed over
the line one slash question mark okay
okay
so my wife and i are expecting a
daughter we already have a son who's two
years old our agreement was that i got
to name the first baby and she got to
name the second baby
i look
this is not jermaine to the post uh i'm
sure that seems like a really stupid
way to
break up that
duty i think you both should agree on
all of the names
and if you can't agree
you should just keep looking honestly
until you find one that you both find
amenable cause
that seems like a recipe for
for
this exact situation
um i went with what i thought was a
strong somewhat unique name but that
could just as easily suit a musician as
a lawyer or a doctor
i picked the name calvin heath
the middle name after my brother who
unfortunately passed away and my wife
was fine with it
look this is all fine okay
it's a little country club but also who
cares
what's in a name a a pog by any other
name would
dopamine just this sweet okay
my wife told me she wants to name our
daughter ever winter rain wherever is
the first name and winter rain is the
middle name
i don't think this is a good name and
that it isn't fair to our daughter
because ever is a word and i don't think
it passes the supreme court justice test
i don't know what that is
um it doesn't sound professional it's
confusing because it's a word and i
don't think it would suit her into
adulthood look i agree
i don't know why he's put i mean like i
i guess it's like a lifetime of
education treating us that something is
not persuasive unless it's written in
essay format but you could just be like
my wife wants to name our daughter ever
winter rain and uh i don't like it
because it sounds stupid as hell and 98
of people reading the post would be like
say no more
i suggested winter as the first name
with a more normal middle name like emma
so she has options but my wife refused
but our agreement was that she got to
pick the name am i the [ __ ] if i
refuse and don't sign the birth
certificate if she wants to name her
ever man you are [ __ ]
this is uh
a really good example of
in a mundane capacity but a really good
example of like you reap what you sow
you know you got carte blanche for the
first name
you didn't and this is your mistake you
didn't drop a nuclear bomb with it you
went with something that was
a little unique it had a little personal
touch to it but was relatively
conventional and then your wife was like
now is my time ever winter rain what you
should have done
is gone with something ridiculous to
start with like you should have been
like poop emoji
is the name of my son
at which point you would have dissolved
this ridiculous agreement
um because it just is very foolish to
just give one person complete control
over the name because this exact
situation could happen
um
so now you're in a weird spot right
which is this is like a classic scam
technique by the way you have already
collected a reward your reward was
naming your son
without your wife being able to veto it
at all
now you're forced to argue from a
position of having already accepted that
reward
and maintaining the cognitive dissonance
of like well you don't you look
we don't i know that i got 100
permission to name my child or the first
child but you don't get that same
permission i'm not saying he's an
[ __ ] because
every winter rain is a name that i find
disagreeable because of the fact that
it's
i'm gonna stop short of saying
stupid
because it's like
you know
it's cultural i guess like if the if it
has a meaning to you that's fine and
they can always change it when they're
18 to begin with hey
for stark thanks for the gifted
subscriptions much appreciated
um but i i think he's doing a noble
thing i think he's gonna eat [ __ ] for it
and that there's something admirable
about that
to be honest with you this is why you
you can't agree in this situation
right
you can never especially i don't mean
like it i'm not suggesting that his wife
was like
here's how i'm gonna screw this guy over
i'm gonna let him him name the first
child he's normal so he's probably gonna
name the child something relatively
normal and then i get to shove through
my agenda on the second one i'm not
suggesting that's what happened
what i am suggesting is
i think if you ever get
suggested that
you know you pick the first name i'll
pick the second you got to be like you
know what let's just both collude on
both of the names and then you can you
can it's like making a coalition
government work right you're never going
to get 100 your way but they're also
never going to come down with like an
edict that makes you want to die
you're gonna end up probably with not
your favorite name but at least a name
where like whenever you introduce them
you know on like activity gym or
whatever you don't have to be like
she's named runescape
rowena
no it's
it's runescape
r-u-n-e-s-c-a-p-e
runescape
not the ass i'm and by the way this is
like this pose is engineered to
have as close to complete consensus as
possible
um
at the risk of sounding like a
caricature
it is a man having a dispute with his
wife which is already probably like a
plus five percent chance to not be the
[ __ ] on reddit and then also
uh it's
one of the things on the internet that
people feel most strongly about which is
like
isn't it weird how people get named dumb
[ __ ]
it's like it's like a hundred percent
i'm surprised it isn't higher
i i gotta read some controversial
comments on this one
gonna go with not the [ __ ] because
your wife sucks at naming things
that name is
dignifiedly hot trash
hundred percent they say this with
respect
hundred percent millennial energy
this this post was written by somebody
who was born between 1984 and 1992 with
a hundred percent authority this is just
a phrase that
it's it's like a a
it's a seed phrase to tell me you're a
millennial
everybody sucks here why in the world
would you make such an arrangement you
could have built in a veto clause okay
it's tort law now or made certain
minimum requirements you didn't you're
an [ __ ] for wanting to go back on the
arrangement now that it doesn't suit you
but who thinks of such a ridiculous name
does she want the kid to have to explain
and spell her name every single time
there's some fairness not the [ __ ]
my mother named me shad i get two
reactions your name is shade shed [ __ ]
or it's shad like the fish life is hard
enough without having a stupid freaking
name
and then you
but you've owned it for your account
here
look at that
okay i'm gonna i'm not actually gonna
refuse to sign the birth certificate but
i'm gonna try to sell her on the name
everly winter rain instead bro that's
still
[ __ ] horrible
that's the rare in this case you might
as well not even go with the compromise
because
you're gonna hurt feelings and not
create a situation that's any better
please
either fight harder or give up
our agreement was i got to name the
first baby and she got to name the
second baby this is up there with me 20
and my partner 38 as one of those
openings that instantly makes me
facepalm oh man
[Laughter]
i'm glad other people saw it yank's not
trying to be rude but her taste in names
is middle school fan fiction levels of
cringe yes
any of the separately are okay winter's
rain reminds me of summer's eve
i don't understand i'm missing a joke
there somewhere
not the [ __ ] your wife wants your
daughter to be a young adult book
protagonist not the
[ __ ] not the [ __ ] yeah i agree
oh no i'm like i'm waiting for the story
that's like
forward forward re re my friend's
sister's cousin's friend works as a
first grade teacher and there was a
student whose name was l a hyphen a
and i said la ah
and then they said actually it's ladasha
source this is really true i promise for
real actually true happens
it's it's happened to everybody's friend
of a friend of a friend over the course
of the last 30 years um
i work at an elementary school and see
all kinds of weird names we had a whole
family of children named after movie
swords blade excalibur
okay ever is fine
i think it's a bit weird myself it's
fine i think it's a bit weird name
should be a joy decision imo but you
chose your path and now she's choosing
the name you're the [ __ ] i just gotta
like i understand where you're coming at
this from okay
but like
i think this is one where as the husband
you gotta recognize that you're breaking
the terms of the arrangement but this is
like a forced major
clause i i putting myself in their shoes
i think i would be content to let my
wife choose the name but then if she
chose something
truly outrageous i'd be like i'm sorry
but i have to be the [ __ ] now this is
an act of god
i i have to do right by my unborn child
by not letting you burden them with this
name
even if it means i'm going back on the
terms of our agreement
not the [ __ ] i think you're the
[ __ ]
i went to a high school with a boy named

test to the supreme court test phantom
and oh jesus christ

runescape runescape
i the [ __ ] for getting angry at my
sister who said she had no money to buy
a gift for our mom's birthday but then
took her girlfriend to dinner at an
expensive restaurant
i don't know this is the rare title that
i don't have an answer right right out
of the gate
normally it's it's clear as day but
let's see
my mother celebrated her birthday last
weekend jermaine question how old is she
you're 26 your sister's 23
if your mom is turning 50
your sister might be the [ __ ]
if your mom is turning 52
i'm not gonna you should do something
nice i'm just saying
they're not all not all birthdays
require
such a an extravagant gift you know
when you're 52 you could
take her out for dinner
get her a nice card take her out for
dinner spend time with her that's
probably what she wants when she's 50
you should get her i don't know probably
like maybe a range rover
my mother celebrated her birthday last
weekend two weeks before i-26f asked my
sister 23f what gift we were gonna buy
for our mom she said she's sorry but
money was tight she didn't have any
money to pitch in for a gift i know my
sister doesn't earn as much as i do so i
told her that was fine i was thinking of
buying our mom a 500 necklace and i
could shoulder the full price of the
gift her contribution
excuse me her contribution could be that
she could choose
she would be the one to buy it from the
jewelry store that's the greatest deal
of all time
you pay for it i get to go to the store
and buy it
this is the worst trade deal in the
history of deals
i would where do i sign up for that
i transferred the money to her and she
bought it i put my and my sister's name
on the front portion and we had a nice
birthday dinner all right let's just say
right off the bat
good sister that's a good sister action
um today i saw in my social media feed
that my sister's girlfriend posted a
picture of the two of them having dinner
at a popular expensive restaurant where
a meal for two would be upwards of 200
bucks my sister's girlfriend's caption
was thanking my sister for the best
anniversary dinner this is a spicy one
and this is this is my bread and butter
okay
what takes precedent
the holiday significance hierarchy
your mother's birthday
or your anniversary with your
significant other
that's a tough one
i would here's the thing
which anniversary is it
and which of your mom's birthday
is it
if it's
your first anniversary
and your mom's
70th birthday
you go with the birthday
if it's your first anniversary it's your
mom's 53rd birthday you go anniversary
all right because
look you're you're you're close with
your parents
i mean you don't have to i just mean on
the family tree like in turn the median
the median person is close with their
parents but you build like a
a unique bubble around the relationship
you have with your romantic partner
they're both important but the
you the holidays you celebrate
with your significant other i think take
precedent personally
but it's a tough question
mom helped raise your girlfriend can get
the smoke
yes but but
your mom raised you but her mom raised
her so is that's the the quintessential
philosophy about the parent-child
relationship
as a parent are you paying forward
the raising that you got from your mom
to your child
or as a child are you responsible when
you get older to pay back
the love and affection that was given to
you as a child from your parent
the way that our family is like
at least on my side the way that it's
kind of set up is my mom
raised me with love and care
and never wants anything from me except
for my time
she wants to shower that attention onto
my my own child
and just continually like pass the
dopamine down the chain
there are some families where it goes in
the opposite direction i think where the
parent
the parents raise you and then when you
get to be a certain age they're like
please give us
money now because we
raised you financially which caused us
great cost and now
you know you need to support us i think
it's just the cultural thing honestly
and and then also my parents were just
like really nice about it to begin with
but
child stonks
anyway sorry we've gone too far but i
think that
i think you have a
at a certain age and with a certain
relationship i think you have a closer
relationship with your spouse than your
parents i mean you spend like well it's
not a spouse but you spend more time
with your romantic partner than you do
with your parents by like a factor of 50
maybe maybe more honestly
anyway sorry i got lost in the weeds
[Laughter]
i got upset and called my sister and
asked her why she told me that she
didn't have money for a gift from my mom
but she apparently had money to have
dinner with her girlfriend in an
expensive restaurant she got defensive
and said that i was okay paying for my
mom's gift all by myself so i was angry
that she and her girlfriend had an
expensive dinner i told her that it was
not about them having an expensive
dinner but about the fact that she lied
about not having money and wasn't
willing to spend literally not a single
dollar for a gift from my mom while she
was spending hundreds of dollars for a
dinner for her girlfriend look okay this
is why every argument needs somebody
like a an argument
arbitrator
that can stand in the argument and be
like that's not fair because this
she lied about not having money whatever
one second she wasn't willing to spend
anything not literally a single
dollar as the argument arbitrator
did you ask her if she would feel
comfortable spending a single dollar or
did you not even ask her for a dollar
because that would be so patronizing uh
to be like hey how about i pay 4.99 and
you pay one and then we'll both write
our names on it
i don't think that you
i don't think you have the right to
offer that i'm gonna pay for the whole
thing and then be like you didn't even
pay for point two percent of it
anyway
i'm not saying op's wrong by the way
my sister said she didn't lie to me she
had no money for mom's gifts because she
already allocated the money to the
dinner with her girlfriend and she
doesn't even know why she has to explain
herself because i have no right
to tell her how to spend her money this
is going to be one of this is going to
be the flashpoint issue for this episode
because as of right now i don't have a
problem with the sister in this
situation this is going to be the one
that's going to lower the like dislike
ratio to like you know 92 percent
instead of 98.
my point is that she did have money she
could have given me 20 and had dinner
with her girlfriend but she didn't want
to spend anything for the woman who gave
birth to and raised us
am i the [ __ ] okay okay okay okay
okay edit edit edit we all went in the
heat of the moment we all said some
things that we disagree with now with
cooler heads added just to clear it up
because it's a recurring
misunderstanding in the comments not due
to the way i wrote it but just
independently thousands of people
misreading it in the exact same way i
did not ask my sister to shoulder half
the cost of the necklace she told me she
didn't have money to pitch in for a gift
before i told her what i was planning to
get for our mom for those asking we
always do joint gifts to make it more
special a gift from both daughters
instead of just one in the past i have
always paid more because i earned more i
just asked my sister what she can afford
to pitch in and take it this is the
first year she said she doesn't have any
money to pitch in okay
let's start with the obvious preamble
almost every am i the [ __ ] can just
be
solved or at least
ameliorated a little bit by having a
conversation with the person instead of
going to reddit first but i get that
this is also like a vent
i would also like to say that
when you get the chance to display your
argument your side your emotions and
your feelings you have a huge advantage
in the court of public perception it
takes a lot
most disagreements i think
that come up on these subreddits are
like a 45-55 you know
person a has
a reason to have acted maybe in the
asshole-ish way that they did and then
person b has the right to be upset about
it it's less like you know hey they shot
my
pet
am i the [ __ ] for crying you know
there's some of that
me 18 my boyfriend 55 etc etc but most
of them are like you know somewhere in
the you can understand both sides and
then you just pick one that you agree
with right um
this one
i i gotta say
i feel like sister
not the [ __ ] let me lay out my case
okay
from the series of events or the
sequence as outlayed by op it seems like
op's sister said i don't have any money
to contribute and then
op decided
i have the means to buy an expensive
gift i'm happy to do it we'll put both
our names on it
if
op
one
let me rephrase if the sister had been
like i can only contribute twenty
dollars
would op have still gotten a 500
necklace or would she have maybe gotten
something that was like
200 bucks or 150 bucks or something like
that and then just had you know the
sister contribute whatever she could the
way i see this is that
op doesn't have the right to be upset
that the necklace was expensive and that
the sister didn't help
in spite of the fact that she picked the
gift in the first place
i'm not sure if i phrased that properly
if they had colluded
on a gift that would have made the
sister more comfortable with maybe
throwing in 10 bucks 20 bucks something
like that
i feel like my hunch is that op would
have been like we can't get our mom
a 50 gift we gotta at least up it a
little bit so i don't feel like you have
the right to choose an expensive gift
and then be mad that your sister
independently
spend money on an important event to be
honest but i i don't think you have the
the the right to be mad that the gift
you chose was expensive and the other
person spent a commensurate amount of
money that could have helped with a gift
on something else she didn't say hey i
don't have money please buy a 500 gift
she just said i can't really contribute
and then you chose a 500 gift
that's my take on the subject
she wasn't mad about the amount she's
mad about the lying
i disagree on whether this is lying you
know
if uh
i mean i i hate to say it
let's let's come up with a situation
let's say i have
100
650 dollars in my savings account okay
uh
but
i know that as soon as walmart releases
playstation fives
in eight days
i'm gonna spend almost all that money on
a playstation 5. if someone asked me do
you have the money to pitch in on this
do i say yes i have the money to pitch
in or do i say no because the money
that's in my savings account is already
spoken for
whether or not you believe that a
playstation 5 is more important than
your mom's birthday gift you say no
right
a playstation 5 is not comparable it's
actually not comparable because the
playstation 5 at least has some use
whereas a 500 necklace is suspend
essentially just giving like you know
some profit to the people's diamond
corporation uh because you're like i
don't know too embarrassed to just tell
your mom like thank you for raising me i
love you you're like one of the most
important people in my life instead
you're willing to pay like a tax to the
people's jewelry corporation so that
the gesture can say it for you at least
a ps5 you know it can play demon souls
remake
the necklace is is completely useless
i would also say money is tight by the
way
i'm not going to judge how the sister is
spending her money
but if she can only afford
either her mom's birthday gift or this
dinner then money's tight that's not a
lie
if if
throwing like if if having an expensive
special
dinner causes you to have to adjust
you know fi your financial obligations
and other aspects of your life money
that's that's the definition of tight
you gotta move stuff around
whether or not she should you know
spend her money if she has a limited
amount she should be should she be
spending so much of it on like one
dinner that's a personal decision that's
not for me to judge necessarily i don't
really want to be uh on record here on
my stream being like hey poor people
should never have nice things even for
special events if you want to type that
in chat and be like actually she should
have bought like you know seven
kilograms of black beans and a bag of
rice instead then by all means
you know i'm just saying
she she basically had to make a choice
is she going to
buy her mom an expensive
or contribute to her mom's expensive
birthday gift that was chosen by
somebody who is not in his financially
tight situation as she is or
alternatively spend that money on you
know
getting her
you know strengthening and celebrating
her relationship with her significant
other i would
i would say it's the sisters business
honestly but i do also acknowledge
like
i'm
in the minority here a little bit and i
think it's a tight issue like i can see
why people would be on both sides
i do agree with the people in chat by
the way who are saying like my mom
wouldn't want me to buy her something
like that i i'm in the same boat like
if we bought we
if we take my mom out for like
if we go to like cactus club which is i
don't know how to describe it like one
step up from like an applebee's she's
like oh my god you guys please let me
pay for this and i'm like mom just shut
up
we're picking up the check you didn't
have to get eight bellini's but like
we'll still pick up the check don't
worry about it okay
just relax
but i do also recognize
like sometimes we'll buy kate's mom a
nice thing
and she'll be like
thank you so much also what you couldn't
splurge for like one size higher
[Laughter]
so you don't you don't get to choose who
your family is maybe the mom maybe that
kind of stuff is important to uh
to her mom but anyway
i don't know i'm interested to see the
comments here though
let's see
not the [ __ ] from now on just get
your mama gift herself if your sister
can't afford to that's on her
that's totally true by the way like i
don't disagree with that
if you want to just get her a gift and
be like this is from me
and then you know vanessa can handle her
own gift that's totally fine
that seems like a great solution not the
[ __ ] just by giving separately from
now on i didn't even consider that man
that's that's only child brain right
there i didn't even consider that you
could just split the gifts
save you a lot of grief
not the [ __ ]
there's a difference between being able
to afford something and whether or not
you literally have the money you asked
her only two weeks in advance she'd
already made the plans wait okay so
who's so who's the [ __ ]
i don't i
not oh not the [ __ ] no [ __ ] here
okay yeah i would agree with that
and by the way uh based and egg pilled
most people don't buy 500 gifts had you
suggested splitting a 60 gift maybe she
could have found the money to do that in
the future just buy your own gifts yeah
absolutely and then of course
only two weeks it's not a surprise their
mother's birthday has been the same for
their entire lives
if the sister can remember to put money
aside for her anniversary after a couple
years she should be able to remember to
put money in aside for an event she's
been celebrating for decades
any i hate i hate this formatting
again millennial energy i think
whatever happened to bold man now we're
all using caps
hold on if you'll excuse me
your sister is an adult she's allowed to
spend her money however she wants she
should be allowed to go in on an
anniversary dinner with her girlfriend
it makes some sense she'd prioritize it
on an anniversary dinner over a 500
necklace for her mom
i agree so far you seem weirdly
controlling about your sister's life
well you were the one who chose such an
expensive gift offered to pay for it all
put her name on it you could have just
made it your gift and left her out of it
this just seems like cr you creating
petty drama you're the [ __ ]
yeah
kind of again this is all like
how you read it without them having had
a conversation
i mean again like it just a it's a
difference of opinion right like
we always get her joint gifts i thought
it would be more special for my mom a
gift from both of her daughters instead
of just from one i earned more than my
sister so i'd always pay more i would
just ask her what she can afford to
pitch in and take it this is the first
year she said she doesn't have anything
i was okay with that because i really
thought money was tight for her i'm like
just because she spent 200 bucks on a
dinner doesn't mean money is not tight
right like i mean it would be a
different story if you were like
hey like we need you to contribute to
mom's medical bills
and she was like oh i can't i have this
anniversary dinner that i'm spending 200
on but you're like these are two
forgive my phrasing here okay these are
two frivolous expenses
the sister has the right to choose which
one
is more important to her if
it's not like one of them is more valid
and necessary and then the other one is
like a complete luxury like they're
they're both
discretionary expenses
i just don't understand uh
why it's like she lied about being
broke it's like you can still be
you can spend 200 on a dinner and still
be broke you could like buy something
nice for a gift and still be broke if
anything you're more broke because
you've done it
this is not like uh
it's not like
you're policing like have you suffered
enough to be able to spend this
tight but you're not wearing a barrel
with suspender straps on it that's what
i'm exactly
[Laughter]
like none of
at no point in the article is it like my
sister is destitute and derelict uh
and yet she's going out for a 200 dinner
while like you know sucking on the teeth
of the taxpayer or whatever it's just
like she doesn't have enough money to
contribute to a gift but she also bought
a nice dinner that doesn't make her a
hypocrite
just you know she went she went out for
a nice dinner
why are you wearing a windbreaker inside
because i am a windbreaker inside
based
not the [ __ ] but this is a big but
you need to realize people budget what
they prioritize i prioritize food and
rent not everyone does
it's always
people who don't spend money
always think that they have the moral
high grounds you don't know that your
sister is not also prioritizing food on
the table in rent
your mom's birthday gift is not food on
the table or rent it's that's another
discretionary expense
i'm not saying it's not important i'm
just saying you don't get to be like
well you and i have reasonable budgets
because we're smart people but there's
some dummies out there that buy you know
they spend money on different things
that are frivolous
some people will always have money for
alcohol or cigarettes regardless you
always have money for what and who is
important to you your mom was not in
your per mom was not important her
girlfriend was the end
man that's crazy
i kind of like envy
um
the viewpoint of people who
just see things so cut and dry as this
so clearly
there's been a lot of times like if you
distilled it down to his brass tacks in
my early 20s
i don't think i ever got my mom a
birthday gift that was more than just
like a card and a phone call
and i definitely spent money on dumb
[ __ ]
and i'm very thankful that i was not
judged as like oh so like in september
uh you know
you had 20 beers out with your friends
over the course of the whole month and
yet you didn't get you could have bought
me a 42 gift with that amount of money
or something like that like my mom is
more important to me but at the same
time like
i mean it's just like a weird confluence
of things like you always have money for
what and who is important to you
i guess i just see it differently that
like
you know you can show your appreciation
to the people in your life
uh without
needing to quantify it with like a
financial ledger item
like i i've never gotten like a birthday
card from someone and then been like oh
i guess i'm not important enough for you
to shove 20 bucks in the card i'm always
like you know
thanks uncle greg i appreciate the card
thanks for thinking of me
we haven't spoken in like 11 years and
you still have my birthday in your
calendar that's kind of sick like
i guess i guess you're just like a bad
child
if you uh spend money on your girlfriend
but not on your mom
you know what maybe your mom should have
bought like
into the s p 500 in the 90s when she was
uh earning and it's gone like 7x from
then and then she could buy like her own
gifts uh
you know how do you feel about that mom
you grow you grew up in an economic
golden age
and yet you're out here asking me to
throw you
stop having anniversary dinners you pay
for a 500 necklace come on
all right we got like i think we got one
more in us
if your workflows still consist of long
email threads and casual conversations
in the hallway you need monday.com the
smart way
to manage your team monday.com gives you
the visibility you need to monitor all
ongoing projects in real time so you're
always in control
tell me your trello without telling me
you're trello
um
we already did the only fans one that
was like a month ago
would i be the [ __ ] if i don't tell
my best friend's dying mother that my
son is actually her grandson
i'm not touching that one with a 10-foot
pole
am i the [ __ ] for grounding my
daughter for using an evil spell on her
deceased mother
it's so what is happening i i don't know
any of these man
am i the [ __ ] for choosing a friend
wedding over my sister's segregated one
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to move
out because my polyamorous boyfriend's
wife doesn't want another dog am i the
[ __ ] for refusing to move
because my polyamorous boyfriend's wife
doesn't want another dog
i don't even i'm not judging the
lifestyle i'm just trying to
keep
the nouns in my head to figure out how
these people are connected to one
another
am i the [ __ ] this is a person person
a
i won't move because my boyfriend
person b
his
wife person c doesn't want another dog
how does this happen
cause she has a dog
and she's gonna move in
but they want her to move out with the
dog okay i'm not i'm not touching this
with a 10-foot pole okay delete it
i don't want to be seen as judging this
because like i genuinely don't care
basically at all what people do with
their personal lives um
the only thing this makes me think is
like that's really complicated like it's
just
it's the same thing when i was like
watching the the tiger woods documentary
and it was like he has
14 mistresses
i wasn't like i mean there was a part of
me that's like wow that's like a scumbag
move but there was another part of me
that's like
man you got to be like tired as hell
tiger
that's a lot of work man
i keep like
six people in my life
in contact it's like my mom my dad
my wife my daughter and then like the
discord group
that i talked to that's it and even then
sometimes i'm like ah i'm too tired to
like you know check in with my mom today
tiger woods was like winning
every single grand sl well they're not
grand slams right what are the majors
he's winning
you know 2.78 majors a year married with
three kids millions of dollars in
endorsements he's got 14 mistresses as
well
don't you ever just want to like sit on
the on the on the couch and just take
like a nap or something that's crazy
um like did is it gone the post is
deleted
all right
is it does it get archived no no no okay
i i had to know
um i gotta know man this is the one
cause this is like ridden by an angry
dad am i the [ __ ] for trying to teach
my future step children a little
discipline like the less specific that
you get in the headline
the more you've abstracted it back
in order to make it seem like this is
where ev when an argument gets to the
point you're where you're like oh i
guess i'm the [ __ ] for wanting people
to be happy that's wha you're like so
far back from the thing that originally
caused the argument to begin with that
you've already lost
let's see
me
i'm 46 engaged to 41 she has two kids 15
11 from a previous marriage she raised
them largely on her own and they're
great kids i love them as my own
however she has most definitely spoiled
the hell out of them gives them
everything they want and as i've been
slowly finding out in the last few years
she's basically done everything for them
their entire lives they've never been
given the slightest bit of
responsibility they're both very lazy
but they constantly have their hands out
looking for someone to give them
something this is not gonna be popular
with chat right now but like
yeah i hope this is uh 11
male not 11 months old
[Laughter]
because if they're 11 months old you
should give them whatever they ask for
because speaking as the parent of an 11
month old it's just a lot of
you know food and affection basically um
i could understand
having a 15 year old step daughter and
being like we need to start teaching her
some responsibility maybe it's a boom or
take but i think part of the role of a
parent especially as they're in that
period where they're transitioning from
child to adult is to spoon feed them an
opportunity to
gain responsibility because the older
you get the the more responsibility you
have to take on to begin with
i was raised very differently not in a
strict household but a single-parent
household with mom my siblings and i
were taught very early about
responsibility and basic life lessons we
did without which made us appreciate
what we had i had been slowly trying to
burn it into their brains that they are
not babies
gentle
i was raised in this situation i've been
trying to sear it into their cerebral
cortex that they're not babies
uh and that they need to pick up around
the house without having to be
constantly told to do so if you want
something earn it by doing chores my
fiance gives me a ton of blowbacks she
doesn't see why i get so upset when they
won't get off their asses i'm trying to
teach them self-sufficiency she tells me
i'm being an [ __ ] and i'm being too
hard on them this guy's identity is
wrapped up in never asking for help
which is
okay that doesn't make him a bad person
necessarily
but it it it's like he knows that you
have to phrase
it in a gentle way like i want to
introduce them to responsibility so they
don't grow up to be completely helpless
but then the language he uses to talk
about it makes it sound like whenever he
sees like a cup on the island he's like
where the frick did this cup come from
you know you didn't need to
uh
you guys are so lazy i'm trying to teach
you how to be self-sufficient like it's
just a little
there's a
there's a culture difference here
you know there's like the the way that
he talks versus the way that he sees
himself he sees himself as like a
chivalric knight but he talks like his
profile photo on twitter is him in his
truck wearing sunglasses let me clarify
a bit by the way
what say you am i the [ __ ]
we talked about these things before
moving in together yes it was agreed
we'd both work together with regard to
how we'd handle the kids i asked her
point blank
if she would be okay with me imposing a
little bit more of a direct approach to
letting them know they'd have to pitch
in around the house she was 100 on board
also she said she expected me to act as
her equal as far as parenting went that
was her idea not mine i told her from
the very beginning i would never ever
intentionally overstep her boundaries
i'm not a hard ass i'm actually very
laid back but when i'm asked to parent
these kids and i see them being lazy
unmotivated and okay look look look look
look look look
the 15 year old
okay
you got to take a different approach
with the teenager
than the 11 year old though he's an 11
year old being lazy unmotivated
disrespectful i won't speak to but
lazy
they're 11.
they're like they're in like fifth grade
that's you don't have to impose that
kind of culture in them at that age i
mean like you get them a couple of
breadcrumbs to get along the road but
lack of specific examples here is
troublesome i would agree with that as
well like there's no we we're being
asked to exclusively look at this one in
a vacuum which i i don't respect
give me a specific situation well let me
i didn't mean to yell at them but i had
a really hard day at work uh i was so
annoyed when i came home i stubbed my
toe on a skateboard and then i just went
off i completely lost control but it's
not my fault because the 11 year old kid
doesn't have a job yet so um
it sounded good to her in theory but now
she's balking at it and i feel like i'm
trapped in a minefield not sure which
way to step without risking an explosion
yes that is indeed that's the metaphor
you and look now i'm just being i'm
being the [ __ ]
but when you make a metaphor
you're making the metaphor as a
substitution for spelling out
the exact thing that you mean
you don't need to be like
i feel like i'm stuck between a rock and
a hard place now like i can't move
because i've got two things that are
pressing in on me making it impossible
you know it's uh that that's the what
the purpose of the metaphor is but
anyway
i love them as my own nothing in your
post even indicates you even like these
children that come on
that's too far you don't know that
he could be a great stepfather
this is just too much man
anyway
sorry
you're the [ __ ] you're not the parent
here their actual parent is telling you
this is not a big deal
did you see ops update
did i see ops update
i don't think i did you got to go to qa
for that
you're the [ __ ] oh oh no oh no
downvoted op
old-fashioned childhood learning basic
life stuff like simple responsibility is
old-fashioned good luck with that
mindset minus 51.
sort by
q a
i don't know how to use reddit
if i didn't like them would i be here
asking for opinions from total strangers
in an effort to remedy the situation
yeah swinging a miss on your part oh no
they're a facebook user
how upset are you getting i don't scream
and yell or put my hands on them if
that's what you're asking
nope
that's pretty much like the bare minimum
i am not looking for validation also i
don't think i've been combative at all
shy of giving a bit of snark back to
those who gave it to me first you do
know that there's such a thing as tough
love right
there's no easy way to step into this
situation as anyone who has ever tried
will attest calling them a spoiled
doesn't mean i don't love them they
freely admit they're spoiled they know
it they own up to it but thanks for the
input
i appreciate it oh
oh no
look at the downvotes man this is crazy
it's i and i think it's deserved
why is this guy so allergic to answering
questions right
have you ever worked with children
before this is a genuine question yes
so
wow very believable
i've worked with kids so often i can't
even write any specifics out because
like
if there's just so many my keyboard
would break by the time i finished yeah
no yeah for sure
more please more you are not a parent oh
no what have i done no
oh my god they're still po they're
posting on other stuff now
they took that as a great opportunity to
launch their account
nice piece of wax
[Laughter]
vinyl releases
nice piece of wax anyway
he posts there of course that i didn't
mean to click on it i know it could have
been nsfw
anyway i think he's kind of the [ __ ]
in this situation
either way um we're gonna move on this
was a fun react chord though slash
marker
the
end of react
chord



you're the [ __ ] tell me more
all right nobody's gonna get a photo huh
well i mean i look i have to put myself
i i have to take a stand
i will
the stand i'm taking is i need to know
what the house was like because
genuinely i'm like
it
i'm i'm let me just put it this way i'm
stunned to the number of people in chat
who are like no matter what it's not the
[ __ ] if you held your house to a
reasonable standard of cleanliness
and then somebody came over and instead
of sleeping which is like what you want
to do um she spent seven hours cleaning
your house essentially sending you the
message that you're like uh a total slob
um
you wouldn't be upset if you're like
what if you had spent time cleaning it
but like before she came over on top of
that i would be upset
the flip side is
if i saw a photo and there was and it
looked like a
like a [ __ ] disgusting like dorm i
would be like i i don't think she's the
[ __ ]
i think her her boyfriend should grow up
and you know
either accept
the bachelor life wholeheartedly and
hang out with the guy who drinks three
quarters of a pink whitney every night
or alternatively like if you want to
have people over to your house you got
to make it like safe and comfortable for
them to be there
that's i mean i that's where i'm at he's
like 33 yeah but his house could have
been clean the wrinkle in this is that
uh
like she's
many standard deviations of caring about
cleanliness off from the average person
right i have a hard time falling asleep
if there's even one dish in the sink
i feel unclean
my mom instilled how important it is to
me to have my house clean would get me
to redo chores five or ten times in a
row i was never allowed to go to bed if
the house was messy like that's the kind
of thing where i can foresee because
there's no damn photo there's no
evidence which is suspicious in and of
itself
but
i can foresee a situation where she came
over and the house was actually kind of
normal but she was like there's two
dishes in the sink i literally can't
sleep whether or not that dude's a
little funky for dating someone 11 years
younger than him look that's
personal opinion
i agree with you and honestly just
sounds exhausting as someone who deals
with you know i'm 32 and i deal with 25
year olds in chat all day i can't even
imagine being around a 22 year old for
like more than 12 hours in a single
sitting but much less like you know
having them over at my house i'm just
saying like
personally this is uh i i can see
i can foresee a situation
where
he thought the place was tidy and kind
of got blindsided it took hours to clean
yeah but anything can take hours to
clean if your standards for cleanliness
or that has got a sparkle right
house cleaning is a it's an elastic task
you can you can stretch it or compress
it as necessary
anyway
yeah
it sounds like she should um
get a job as like a a house cleaner it
seems like she's very thorough
bad take
bad take through and through tell me uh
you don't have uh any points to back up
your argument
instead you're just just trying to
thought police bad take
anybody else think this is a bad take or
just me boomer take boom or take anybody
else crawling like a viper through these
suburban streets or just me
bad take why you should know okay cool
yeah all right
take a photo of your floor right now
send it over
is it a bad take because you've got a
floor littered with filet of fish
wrappers and you just want someone to
clean it up for you
i'm just asking just asking for a friend
like two people can play the ad hominem
game okay and i gotta tell you i
probably got more experience hosted the
nlss for like a decade
am i now here we go let's let's get
let's let's annoy the half of chad that
agreed with me and get on the side of
the half of chat that thought it was a
bad take with this one am i the [ __ ]
for asking my wife for a day of solitude
when i have an anxiety day about twice a
month
hard to tell just from the title but i'm
just gonna say i don't think that's
gonna go over that well
i i look just asking for it means you're
braver than i am but let's let's see
i work full-time and my wife stays at
home with our child okay you are [ __ ]
dude
i don't even need to read the rest
whether you're right or wrong you can't
escape this with your life
um
work is incredibly stressful because of
our short staffed we are i've been
putting in a lot more overtime i get off
maybe one day a week about once or twice
a month i go into a depressive funk it's
always on a day off i don't know if it's
just my body crashing from all the work
or what i'll wake up and immediately
feel emotionally and physically terrible
there's no way to destress i can try
doing hobbies like playing video games
but they end up feeling like chores and
stress me out i feel my body physically
shaking and the moment somebody says
something to me i want to go off of them
the only way to get through the day is
just to go to bed and be by myself count
it as a wasted day and then try again
tomorrow all right that like
definitely [ __ ] sucks
no doubt and i'm not saying this person
is the [ __ ] especially not based on
like the first paragraph
um
that being said you also had to pull
yourself in your wife's shoes that like
six days a week she's on full-time baby
duty and the one day
maybe weekly that she's gonna get off to
uh
you know do anything that isn't just
singing the same
10 songs over and over and over again
um
you know
well i don't know how to phrase it
[Laughter]
well all i'll say is it sucks for
the wife in this situation who is like
um
you know
on on the one day where i might okay
that's true i don't know as a baby i'm
i'm i'm i'm projecting i guess but
like
like it's still well i mean
i will relieve her of baby duty yeah
okay frick you that's why because i read
ahead
when i'm not in a funk i will help her
out at home i'll relieve her of baby
duty and do chores but days i am in the
funk i can't do anything for fear of
lashing out i told my wife i'll let her
know when i'm having anxiety that day
and it's nothing she did but i just need
to be left alone to sleep it off she
gets upset either way i know it's not
fair to her because she doesn't get a
day off i'm just afraid i'll screw
something up because i'm not in a good
head space i thought about going to a
doctor but nothing's covered by my
insurance so i would have to pay
hundreds that we don't have so what do
you think wow um okay so not that well
okay
you're the [ __ ] but for like good
reason
i don't know if we've had many of those
in the well we've had some but i don't
know how many of those we've had in the
past
it's like i in in the the the
microcosmic situation between you and
your wife
you
are asking her something unfair but
you're doing it for a reason that makes
a lot of sense which is you're suffering
from
bad mental health and feeling like you
don't have the means to fix that so yeah
i don't have a great funny answer for
this um
that that sucks
basically um let's let's see what people
in the comments are saying i'm sure that
it'll be uh
reasonable
you're the [ __ ]
you are a parent now get therapy take a
few minutes to clear your head listen
okay i know
we're
amazing worldwide depression rates fall
to zero that's what i was worried about
is that i would be like you know
hey that sucks for you bro you know i'm
a parent i have hard days too but you
know i just suck it up because i guess
like i'm different um
i look i
in principle i don't necessarily
disagree i don't think that's how it
works though i want to be sympathetic
but you're the [ __ ] it's weird that
your funk days are always on your days
off and since you won't get help i don't
see why your wife shouldn't be upset she
has to deal with house chores your kid
she gets to worry about her husband's
well-being that sounds like an awesome
day for her man they are
they're lighting this guy up in the
comments man
they are
find a new job made if your book is so
no it's
they're they're going ready for the
jugular
so your days off when you could be
helping out with your baby at home you
could be giving your wife a free day are
the days you're magically just in a funk
and want to free pass the runoff and do
your own thing
uh
the only way to get through the days is
just go to bed and be by myself count it
as a wasted day and try again tomorrow
anyway the thing is like i agree
in principle like i can see it from the
wife's standpoint like that
sucks
uh it just also sucks for the husband i
think this is one where like if you're
making a comment that's like this is so
easy then you're kind of the [ __ ]
because uh
you know this is not like a black and
white situation
this is just
i mean it just blows
yeah anyway
basically i don't know like
what what kind of i'm not the i'm not
the person with all the answers right
i do think
you know as somebody who is like
completely ignorant about mental health
i do think that
you have a responsibility especially
when you have a child to to find a
healthier way of coping with it
um
but
i also
have the luxury of of being in a
position where like
you know the cost of mental and it's not
covered by the way in canada like
much like dental care people assume that
like mental health care is covered up
here but really it's just you know
necessary medical care is like is
covered up here um or if you get like
you know i think if you get
oh if you wait two years it's covered
okay um
i did not know that to be honest but um
i i think if you
you you get a lot of
you get more leeway
after recognizing that you have
the problem when you're taking steps to
fix it i guess that's as comfortable as
i feel like going across
if that makes sense you know if if
you're spending the day in bed because
you have anxiety and then you're like
i've thought about trying to fix it but
can't
people are gonna be in the comments on
you like that's not an option if you're
taking steps actively to
which is easier said than done i'm sure
then i think the people in the comments
will still light you up but light you up
like a little bit less
i feel for the the wife though i mean
that's just like as a that's just a
nasty situation
that's basically
that's that's just uh that's a powder
keg all the way around
anyway well that was fun uh am i the
[ __ ] for buying my girlfriend an
exercise bike can i can i alienate
everybody
i still to this day
am not
dunking on peloton for the peloton wife
commercial and maybe i'm missing the
nuance in it okay so the peloton wife
was a
viral dunk campaign where it was like an
ad where this wife was like hey my
husband got me a peloton and then she
journaled like you know up at 4am
drinking juice on the peloton you know
and she was like
you know she did anyway she she was
working out hard on the bike and the
whole campaign
got dunked on because people were like
wow what an [ __ ] like her husband
basically got her a present that was
like lose some weight so you can be a
supermodel and my whole
like
when when i watched it i was just like
man i wish i wish someone would buy me a
peloton
this [ __ ] is expensive
you know
it would make exercising more fun
if kate got me a peloton i'm not this
i'm not dropping a hint they're very
expensive and we don't have a lot of
space but if kate got me a peloton would
there be a part of me that's like
you know
she's calling me
a little chubby i would be like yeah
she's not wrong
that's why i want the peloton in the
first place
i would
like i would welcome it i would take it
as a as a positive sign but anyway
let's let's so i i always thought the
dunk campaign was like a little too much
on the peloton but
it there is there's a gender difference
for sure
i know i get what you're saying when
you're saying you don't understand
you're a man it's because when a wife
calls her husband fat it's based right
that's what you're trying to say like
it's so much harder to be a man because
like we're constantly body shamed like
that i'm picking up on what you're
saying
i totally get it okay am i the [ __ ]
for buying my girlfriend an exercise
bike
the last three years have been rough on
my girlfriend of four years she's lost a
few family members lost a job but
luckily for a new one lots of stress in
her life she turned to comfort eating to
cope and put on a good amount of weight
nearly 100 pounds for about three weeks
she's been saying i need to lose weight
i need to work out if only i had the
stuff here so hearing that and wanting
to help her out i bought her a peloton
bike for her apartment without telling
her first wanted it to be a surprise she
took the gesture not as i intended she
took it as my boyfriend telling me i'm
too fat my intent was hey i know you're
always talking about losing weight
working out more let me help okay tell
me you're a
software engineer without telling me
you're a software engineer
unfortunately i can't investigate
because you've deleted your account
there was problem
i applied solution and you have the
audacity to be upset with me
it makes notes please debug
rubber duck debug me explain to me okay
um
i here's what i'm gonna say okay
i don't think
that this makes him i don't think he's
an [ __ ] for buying his girlfriend an
exercise bike
i do think
there is like a little bit of an [ __ ]
vibe just in like the first couple of
sentences
the last three years have been rough on
my girlfriend of four years she lost a
few family like i get that he's not
saying hey
some people died so i bought you a bike
but even still i'm like
you know lost the job luckily got a new
one she's got a lot of stress she turned
for to comfort eating to cope and put on
a good amount of weight nearly 100
pounds i don't know something about that
it's
i don't know that sentence just kind of
like weirds me out i don't know that
like i don't think
i guess i'm i'm i woke up on the
different side of the bed today i don't
think he's an [ __ ] for this
maybe i'm being the guy now who's like
she can't be mad he bought her a two
thousand dollar bike
i mean i don't know because like
i'm putting myself in
i i can't put myself in her shoes as
much as i as much as i would like to
because it would strengthen my point
right but like
this is one of those things where i i'm
really like
listen to me okay it's not it's not
actually about the issue at hand i think
like socially there is learned behavior
and one of those learned behaviors is
you don't buy your significant other
especially if they're a woman you don't
buy them exercise equipment you don't
buy them a gym membership you don't buy
them you know an exercise bike because
the the learned behavior in society is
that triggers an alarm bell that it's
like it's over the line and it's seen as
like i bought this for you because
you're fat which
is there's probably
situations where it's true but
simultaneously she also might have just
wanted a damn peloton but apparently she
didn't
and she's saying i gotta work out i
would start working out if i just had
the stuff here he got her the stuff and
she's mad i think i'm gonna say it i
think she's being a little bit of the
[ __ ] in this situation
if if we take opi at their face value
okay
if she really said i need to lose weight
i need to work out if only i had this
stuff here
and then he bought her a peloton
and she's openly mad at him for getting
the pe i don't know man i'm like
if she was just in like enjoying
you know
the
her lifestyle and then he bought her a
peloton unprompted
kind of an [ __ ] move
if
she said i would love to work out i just
want the stuff here
i take that in my brain as like this
problem wants a solution apparently what
it was actually is
i know that i've put on a little extra
weight i just want you to know i have a
good excuse for it please don't try to
help me at all that's all i'm saying
okay
what would you do if kate buy you a
pilot we covered that earlier i would be
stoked
because i know i put on a little weight
and i would be like yo is that a peloton
that's sick man i'm not saying you
should all
everybody on earth should be like oh
great a peloton i'm gonna say for me i
would be like that's fine
the other way around
well i mean i don't know like i don't
did i mean i i'm getting stun luck
because i just don't know how to answer
the question
i mean my wife has never expressed an
interest in in getting an exercise bike
so
i think it would just be a bad gift but
it would be a bad gift for a different
reason it wouldn't be because of the
insinuation it would be because i bought
her a peloton and then i'd you know be
in her office every day like hey can you
give me a peloton can i can i ride your
peloton real quick hey i'm just to sneak
in here for like 45 minutes and ride
your peloton is that cool with you like
it would be the homer simpson bowling
ball gift right where i would just get
her something that that i wanted to
actually have myself
i got to see the comments man i've never
felt like more at odds with society
which we are living in by the way
deleted account man this guy
he didn't do anything that wrong
did you do cyberbullied him into the
lead deleting his whole account
by the way before we get down here i'm
sure there's going to be comments that
are like you're the [ __ ]
you admit yourself things were stressful
for her and people in her life that she
loved have passed on and then you had
the audaci and i'm look
if you read it in the most malevolent
light
possible i understand okay but she said
i need to lose weight i need to work out
if only i had the stuff here even if she
said like
my understanding of
human communication which is [ __ ]
twisted obviously but if someone said i
need to lose weight i need to work out
i'd be like oh yeah me too
yeah we should totally do that and then
just keep kicking the can down the road
until it becomes a bigger problem where
the mood strikes right if she said if
only i had this stuff here that's like
the
the
executable at the end that's like i'm i
have a problem in need of a solution imo
my that's my take on the subject this i
need to lose weight i need to work out
idle conversation yeah me too oh you
know
the only thing rising in the pandemic is
my cholesterol hey if only i had this
stuff here
that's where you've invited us an extra
step in in my opinion but
okay
soft you're the [ __ ] definitely
should have had a conversation first
like asking her what kind of fitness
gear she would like and letting her be a
part of the decision
am i am okay so the conversation part i
think makes sense however am i the am i
so freaked up that like asking her what
kind of fitness gear equipment she would
like and letting her be a part of the
decision is like
i also think that the same logic applies
like if he's an [ __ ] for getting her
a bike i think if he was like hey
specifically what kind of uh exercise
equipment would you like to have i think
that's almost like the same
style of assholery
it's like you you're trapping her in a
box now one way or the other
like
i think this this creates the situation
where we're suggest look i'm not trying
to defend the peloton
company those their treadmills did kill
like a couple of kids okay
now the bikes
seem very nice
they seem very nice indeed i'm not
trying to insult the bikes okay
i'm just talking about the company
however also the ceo doesn't drink water
from glasses when he wakes up in the
morning he drinks 72 ounces of water out
of the bathroom faucet like a damn
psychopath but anyway um
i think we're maybe throwing the baby
out with the bathwater here okay
let's not it is it that he bought a
peloton that's the problem like if he
got her some uh resistance bands or like
a bowflex or the thing that electrocutes
your abs she would be like oh thank you
but don't
no bikes like i don't unders the peloton
is like the rolls-royce
of stationary exercise equipment
if she's mad that he got her a peloton i
feel like if he bought her like a a
dumbbell rack she would have freaking
like taken his head off or something
like that
i don't i don't know if the equipment's
the problem but i do agree that the the
conversation i mean everything on
am i the [ __ ] is more like you know
one conversation would have solved the
problem right like
but that's why the subreddit exists so
i'm glad that people are bad at talking
to one another
i think you had good intentions
but generally when a girl says those
things the first thing she wants is
reassurance and then you can move into
the territory of if you think it would
make you feel better physically and
mentally i can always help you find ways
to i just want to find what's best for
you
look i don't disagree but i feel like
we're we're also this is like an
evolving meta game right like i think
like maybe in the 1950s
if you were the husband who was like if
you think that's what would make you
feel better i i would just want what's
best for you would work because you
would be in like the the top five
percent of
men who were sensitive but now that the
male sensitivity is higher this is also
they they can sniff it from a mile away
you know that's like oh you're just
saying that to be nice you need like i'm
not saying you have to buy her a peloton
i mean that's
crazy i'm just saying you gotta that i
think that that's an old school
line that could work i don't think now i
don't think that's gonna get you
anywhere that's just my two cents at
least
i mean here's it again you can't you
can't flip it because i can't put myself
in in the shoes of somebody who's grown
up you know surrounded by cosmo
magazines and stuff like that
like uh you know i'd like and i'm gonna
i'm gonna pop the bubble for a lot of
men you know the the conventional wisdom
that like men get
oh men age like wine they get so much
more handsome as they get older there's
like eight guys
who you know were schlubby in their 30s
and then like in their 50s they turn
into like a silver fox the average 50
year old man is like you know it looks
like a stuffed animal that's been hug
too much and i say that as somebody
that's on that path myself you know it's
like
yes there's a lot of
tom brady and josh brolin and george
clooney and stuff like that but if you
walk down the street there's like a lot
of guys who are you know
they're coming apart at the seams
right no you're wrong totally totally
yeah totally yeah if you're like a 22
year old guy who's who's drinking a lot
of manhattans like don draper you're
definitely going to look like john john
hamm
uh when you're 45. you're definitely not
gonna look like canned ham
anyway
moving on sorry sorry people don't want
the truth bombs here today
so i i can't put myself in her shoes
specifically is is all i'm trying to say
but
i do think that if i was like i should
lose some weight and my wife was like if
you think that would make you feel
better physically and mentally i can
always help you find ways to i just want
what's best for you i would be like i
get it you're nice and i'm a little fat
you didn't you don't have to rub it in
just buy me a peloton
bra
[ __ ] you
bro
six word bruh edit
if i had a girlfriend i wouldn't treat
her like that
i wouldn't
take her idle whining about wanting to
get healthy seriously i would just
enable whatever lifestyle she wanted wow
it's oh you're such a nice guy we'd say
you say a best when you say nothing at
all buddy
i'm going to give you the benefit of
that bruh i'm going to give you the
benefit of doubt and say not the [ __ ]
now that i farmed you for karma
but dude that was a really brainless
move on your part even if she expressed
interest in it she's clearly insecure
about how she looks so the logical well
you wanted it thing is going to seem
really cold and unempathetic pelotons
are also really expensive i don't know
how long you've been dating but that
kind of investment is a little much
without talking it over first yeah but
like you you know if you break out give
me the peloton back
yo did op missed the entire backlash to
the peloton ads a couple of years ago
where the husband gets her one as a gift
that was peloton virtue signaling imo
i'm i'm there's a few things i'm willing
to dig my heels on for the most part
i'll say something and then whenever
chat's like bad take i'm like oh don't
hurt me
the kangaroo video might be digitally
manipulated and the peloton ad was not
that bad
it was just a bunch of people who wanted
to jump on it and be like i would never
do that plus don't care didn't ask plus
your bike's two thousand dollars
by the way it's
the guy in the post he never said well
you wanted it
she took her gesture not as i intended
she took it as my boyfriend is telling
me i'm too fat my intent was hey i know
you're talking about losing weight let
me help this guy inserts himself as like
uh
where was it here
well you wanted it
you said he might just be
you know getting yelled at without he
might not be going in hard is i guess
what i'm trying to say i'm going with
not the [ __ ] my wife often mentioned
to me that she wanted to work out i did
nothing after a couple of months she
finally told me she wanted a stair
climber worried about the backlash if i
did buy one i dragged my heels on
getting it look what you've done society
you proud of yourself
you made this wife's life that much more
inconvenient because of your response to
the damn peloton ad she was like i'd
love to work out wink wink
husband was like can't buy or something
i'll get canceled
she's like i'd like a stair climber
husband's like nice try
you think i was born yesterday buy you a
piece of exercise equipment you
specifically asked for i'm not trying to
get canceled
finally flatly told me to go and get it
i was shaking
in the planet fitness
told people put their phones away no
photos of me buying this stairmaster hey
who's this stare master for it's for me
it's for me okay it's for me
anyway i'm just i don't think this guy
did anything wrong
i i i can't believe he deleted his
account man
i don't think he didn't need i'm willing
to dig my heels in on this one
i don't think he did anything wrong
am i the [ __ ] for taking away a hobby
my daughter loves
it's gonna be hard for you to dig
yourself out of this one
i female 25 have a daughter that is
seven year old that is a cheerleader
when i initially signed her up it was
just for her to have a hobby my daughter
absolutely you ever hear of a damn
period
jesus christ
my daughter absolutely loves cheering
him with everything that's going on
between my ex-husband aka her dad i was
glad she found an outlet to get her mind
off all the family drama
period
throughout the summer my daughter spend
the majority of her time training in
gymnastics and dance but in her
gymnastics and then when you put the
period you put the preposition right
after it to start the sentence
did you capitalize the i
are you trying to make me have a [ __ ]
aneurysm
sorry i'm i'm leaning into it too hard i
apologize
but in her gymnastics class her coach
really took a liking into my daughter
and my daughter also adores her back but
sadly this summer she spent most of her
time with her coach more than me given
because i'm single mother and it's
sometimes hard because i also have four
other kids besides her so it could be
hard finding that one-on-one time with
her all right that's like
that this sentence has illuminated
the
the meta aspects of what's going on that
was a great sentence
my daughter talks about her coach
nonstop and all the things she does with
her and even other moms tell me that my
daughter is the coach's favorite and
paranoid side of me starts thinking this
is this relationship weird because when
i looked at my daughter and the coach
together is literally looking like
mother and daughter when school
starts to start back up again i told the
coach she can't come as much because
school's starting back up she gets kind
of visibly upset that i was putting
school first before cheer
she then offers that she comes straight
after school for an hour and a half
fully paid for my daughter really wanted
to still attend her class so i agreed
but now this week she asked me if my
daughter can join her elite team but
that means more time my daughter will
have to spend training and i can't
travel with her all the time because i
have other kids plus i have a custody
agreement with her dad so it's really
not in the cards so i told her that she
can't and we got into this disagreement
she told me i'm holding my daughter back
and she can be in the olympics that i'm
neglecting her and that she's trying to
save her to become like me which was a
mom at 18.
that was yesterday and i l cried when i
had time to myself look i'm sorry
that was yesterday and i cried when i
had time to myself because she made me
feel like i didn't care about my
daughter right now i'm feeling like i
don't want my daughter back with that
teacher it would crush my daughter if i
told her she can't see her coach anymore
so am i the [ __ ] for taking away a
hobby my kid loves
more information on the coach she
literally an abby lee miller
if anyone watched dance moms she's very
intense when it comes to training the
kids at her gym the elite team coach is
referring to is a travel team that age
group 9 to 12 year olds i did try to
look to transfer into nearby gyms but
the deadlines for registration already
passed
so i have not seen dance moms
i don't know if that's gonna
um
impact my ability to weigh in on the
decision
i don't know if i feel comfortable
weighing in before i've i've watched
dance moms
is that on uh hbo
i i go watch if it's on tlc oh that's
okay i get that
i get i get tlc um i uh
i have to be honest i feel like none of
the meaning of the post made it into my
head because i was so focused on reading
it
so i i just want to go over it she's 25
years old she has a seven-year-old child
the seven-year-old child loves
cheerleading she went to cheerleading
which led to gymnastics at gymnastics
she became very close to her coach the
mom
understandably to some extent is a
little jealous that's that's one aspect
of it um
but also is finding it difficult to
allow
her daughter to spend so much time at
gymnastics
is it because she's jealous of the
relationship that she has with the coach
or is it because she also has four other
kids which i have to imagine is like
incredibly exhausting um and i gotta
tell you we're not getting any help from
the peanut gallery on this one 43 you're
the [ __ ] 42 percent not the [ __ ]
um
i mean i feel like you're kind of
uh not the [ __ ]
for
possibly not wanting your daughter to
get insanely serious about gymnastics
at the age of seven
uh
and also recognizing that when you have
five kids like
your ability to
have any of them get like super involved
with extracurricular stuff like this is
gonna you know it's gonna put your
already
at a premium time into much more scarce
territory but you're also kind of the
[ __ ] if you just don't want it to
happen because she's becoming very close
to her coach
and i think the only person who can
really answer that is casey lee
the op
you got i think you got to go deep into
yourself you know and figure out are you
being uh are you upset because of the
fact that you know you're you're jealous
of the relationship that your daughter
has with a coach or is it literally that
it's just not feasible to do with with
your family
i don't know
beats me
she could be an olympian though yeah but
like probably every seven-year-old could
be an olympian right
yeah we need to see a video of this kid
doing gymnastics that's the king solomon
decision
if i see this kid do gymnastics because
they're doing flips and landing like
perfect tens like nadia komen each then
i'm like you're the [ __ ] let the kid
pursue her dream if she can't even get
up on the pommel horse then then no
you're not the [ __ ] the coach is
trying to grift you i need to see i need
to see video evidence of how good this
kid is at gymnastics okay
anyway it's pretty like if the coach
actually said
uh
you're holding your daughter back i want
her to not become like you which is a
mom at 18. that's pretty messed up
i mean if anything if she's an olympian
gymnast she could be a mom at 18 because
don't they retire when they're like 16
she could take her two gold medals and
just kind of like you know enter the
next phase of her life
i don't know why i'm just making jokes i
don't know what do you want me to say
gino said bye thanks for the thanks for
the gift of subscriptions thank you
thank you
i i don't have an answer for this she
seems like kind of an [ __ ]
it it seems like
her
she doesn't want her child
to
be with the coach because she's she
wouldn't have brought up how jealous she
is of the relationship with the coach if
it wasn't part of the issue so i think
if that if we're assuming that that's
part of the issue then yes that makes
you kind of the [ __ ] to
uh potentially limit your daughter's
potential because you're jealous that
she has a a relationship with a coach
that makes you feel like you know you're
not as good of a mom
as sucks by the way you know that's part
of the human experience i guess is
navigating emotions like that
um but also the coach is kind of like an
[ __ ]
for
uh
you know the things that she said if she
actually said them so
gymnastics coaches don't necessarily
have the best reputation for being nice
people so
i'm not surprised
um
necessarily at least from i don't know i
don't mean that stuff i just mean like
even um
like the you you watch documentaries on
gymnastics or gymnasts and they're like
yeah i was six years old and my coach
would like make me do the splits and
then stand on my shoulders so that my
freaking pelvis would explode you know
it's like hardcore training at a very
young age
because you you hit like your your peak
is a gymnast i think at like age 17 or
something like that
this is not phrasing like you're just
reading it in the worst way possible
it's the same way when i was like
it's like a chat full of people the same
that was like uh when i was like i
always fall asleep listening to
audiobooks like i've been listening to
the rise in the fall of the third reich
and like eight people in chat were like
a little problematic is it oh is it
it's not a how-to
it's not like 12 steps to create the
third reich it's just history
it's like you got it it's it's
it's just knowledge it's not like trying
to
get into any spicy territory
okay he's getting brainwashed in his
sleep
it's the same we play warioware
i'm like you know screw ashley there's
90 people in chat that she's 12 years
old
yeah
and
no like first off i didn't mean it like
that but then secondarily like you're
bopping me because you know the the
height of humor is that's what she said
and then thirdly it's a it's a cartoon
witch that doesn't exist in the real
world you gotta you got a problem you
gotta you gotta learn how to talk like
adults
[Laughter]
it's too much
it's not walking on eggshells you're
walking on the sidewalk and people are
trying to throw eggshells you know with
the least generous reading of what you
just said if you filter it not me but
someone who's crazy might misinterpret
what you're saying uh if you do
just shut the [ __ ] up
jesus christ
all right moving on
you're gonna run out of eggshells
am i the [ __ ] for telling my coworker
it's not my fault that she's single when
she said it's not okay for my husband to
send me gifts at our workplace
am i the [ __ ]



for telling my co-worker
it's not my fault she's okay so this is
a watermelon ass
this is part of the watermelon ass
continuum of am i the [ __ ] post which
is somebody was insecure
crossed the line and then you dropped a
nuclear bomb on them
i think i should clarify oh okay hold on
we got it we're starting with a
clarification which is
pretty rare
i think i should clarify he does not
show up to work to deliver the gifts in
person he usually sends me breakfast
because i can't have breakfast early in
the morning so when he goes to work he
stops by my favorite cafe orders what i
know what he knows i like it tells them
where the order should be delivered the
owners are his friends so he gives them
the notes to be delivered with the order
look that is very nice
but also i can see
how that would make your co-workers
dirty
dirty angry
[Laughter]
i was thinking about the the messy
boyfriend post because i glanced at the
age difference that happens later
like here's the thing i
look there's nothing wrong with sending
your significant other
food at work
but if i was hungry at work
and like my co-worker was constantly
getting her favorite breakfast delivered
every single day by her her loving
husband
i would be like man what a [ __ ]
it wouldn't be fair
just to be clear i would be in the wrong
i would be the [ __ ] but i would also
i would be mad my madness wouldn't
justify
my feeling you know it wouldn't make me
have the moral high ground i would just
instead be like
i would be i would be i'd be jealous and
that jealousy would make me angry but
that would it wouldn't be her fault
anyway
and sometimes anger is irrational right
um
and last but not least i received the
order at the entrance nobody receives
the order for me that's why i do not
understand why what bothers her so much
again i am not trying to take the side
of the jealous co-worker
i don't know what bothers her so much i
bet you take that back into the cubicle
shh
steam comes out of it
smell of scrambled eggs and the ham and
cheese croissant and you know fresh hot
espresso
just filling up the whole office
[Laughter]
oh thank you thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
happy to see you it didn't alienate
everybody
also it bothers her that i put photos of
my children and my husband on my desk
which says look okay
i get it
she's jealous okay
we
move on let's talk about the issue at
hand i get it
i just i i'm wary of any story where
they start by
digging a hole to throw the other person
into like before we've even really
gotten to the meat and potatoes of the
post she's already like
didn't
the the street swatch hr now like you
know she just keeps digging it up
ratioed
plus your bald etc etc
sadly this is not time
not the first time she says i'm being
unprofessional for have her having
photos of your children in the office is
not professional so i don't know how i
should act to please her my husband now
this is it is a 24-year age difference
that's a uh
that's a long one
that's
i can't even imagine i mean he was born
in
1971.
my
god he could have bought tears for fears
songs from the big chair at the record
store when it came out
and she's younger than i am
we don't have to go through this
discussion every week okay i
get almost every am i the [ __ ] post
has some degree of like you know
me 19 f and my boyfriend 65 right like
you you know where you stand on a year
or there my my take on this is that my
window of especially like younger just
for people whose company i can tolerate
is like
four years
and i even get pissed off like
i think apollo's 29
and sometimes just hearing him talk
pisses me off
and i say it's vice versa by the way
like he's like oh i bought some pokemon
cards and i'm like [ __ ] you middle
finger emoji
this is like a literal and i quote
middle finger how about you rip open one
of these middle finger
and he's like how's being old and i'm
like it owns jealous
anyway
he's a very romantic and attentive man
and i love that but my co-worker doesn't
like it at all
wait isn't there like a a meme
image that's like
you know you consent she can sense but
isn't there someone you forgot to ask
and it's like jesus christ
you consent she can sense isn't there
someone you forgot to ask susan and hr
good their arms crossed
nope
[Laughter]
that would that would be a gold tweet if
you captured like a paragraph out of
this and then photoshopped that image
and tweeted them both in the same tweet
oh man anyway
oh you skipped a line sorry uh he
usually sends me a rose and coffee every
day
this this dude needs a hobby i'm just
being straight up
i'm gonna here here's i'm not gonna say
this is guy wisdom like i got it all
figured out okay
because i i just i i know myself and i
know
the people that i know i don't know
everybody on planet earth if your
husband gets you he surprises you with
gifts at work now and then
that's great he's a dream come true if
your husband buys you a gift at work
every day
he
has in just my hunch at some point in
his life he
committed a capital offense he killed
somebody
kidnapped something that was involved
with the mafia like that's it's just too
much
a little bit of romance is
great stuff very admirable very
aspirational but a daily
rose
i mean
it's not just the fact that you know a
single rose is probably like 10 bucks is
the fact that like literally every
single day like there's not that many
things that people do on a daily basis
without failure every single day
like
brush their teeth maybe shower go to the
bathroom etc etc i'm i'm honestly
starting to get on the side of like
maybe like if she got breakfast in the
morning and then also like at lunch
coffee and a rose every single day
i might be like
come on it's a little much
don't you i'm starting to take susan's
side a little bit here
not the kid photo stuff that's insane
but there can be two [ __ ] in any
situation
anyway sorry um sometimes he also sends
me chocolates or food from my favorite
restaurant so every day
he gets you breakfast
from
the cafe
he gives you a rose and coffee and then
on some days he also gets you either
chocolates or food from your favorite
restaurant so in an eight hour work day
on average you're getting two to three
surprise gifts
i'm actually now at the point where i'm
like i feel bad for the wife because
it's almost like too much generosity i'm
like i just
you know you get a call on your desk
phone again and you're like hey there's
another package here for you i think can
you just put it at the front desk like
this is too much
it's way too much
oh dude
more more chicken cordon bleu from the
fat duck oh it's fantastic it must be a
wednesday
anyway sorry sorry i i keep getting stun
locked by head cannon that i made up
myself
he's a very romantic and attentive man
and i love that but my co-worker doesn't
like it at all yesterday he sent me some
croissants and a coffee with a note
saying he loved me and when my co-worker
saw it she said i should tell him to
stop that it's not appropriate to
receive gifts every day and another
worker
another co-worker told her she was just
being bitter and it's nice to have such
a loving husband that since i'm pregnant
it's understandable he spoiled me so
much but she insisted it's not
appropriate and if that it doesn't stop
she will talk to the boss she said she
will tell him she feels uncomfortable
and that i'm not being professional
enough and she wants another office mate
i gotta be honest like
i don't necessarily think that her
co-worker is right but i definitely like
the more time that it goes on the more
i'm like i can kind of understand at
least where she's coming from
like if it was the occasional gift
that's one thing i do think the
co-worker is jealous okay based on what
has been posted you never know if cause
maybe if susan wrote this post she would
be like am i the [ __ ] for getting
annoyed that two to three times a day we
get interrupted by uh my co-worker
getting a gift and everybody crowds
around her desk and goes ah
i'm not jealous or anything i just think
that it's annoying that multiple times
every single day we have to pretend that
her husband is so amazing you know like
i think if you wrote it
from the other person's perspective you
could also write it in a way that makes
her seem like she's more in the clear
so
all i'm saying is i could totally
understand
if at the office there were like gifts
coming through three times a day for the
same person
or for anybody but the same person at
least you know you could just talk to
them and be like don't you think it's a
little much
i don't know i'm not saying she's the
[ __ ]
it's none of the co-workers business
but i think we work in an office
everything's everyone's business
unfortunately
i think she should chill as well
don't get me wrong i'm just saying like
you know it's office you know you can't
even get a new pair of shoes it was that
was like my dead man walking moment i
shaved my head
while working my summer job went in with
a full-ish head of hair on a tuesday
came to work wednesday 8 30 a.m with you
know clean shaven you have any idea what
that's like you're not nobody you
nobody's minding their own business it's
so [ __ ] boring
knowing everybody's looking for anything
that they could talk about that's not
like you know microsoft excel or outlook
they're like holy [ __ ]
i do this guy didn't just get a haircut
he cut it clean off man this is like the
most exciting thing that's happened here
in like the past six months
that gorilla took my hair
i shaved my beard four times a year and
everyone freaks out that's what i'm
saying man it's not like you could be
like oh another gift
arrived so
ho hum tick tick tick tick tick tick oh
what is it this time
chicken smarmy wow congrats i got a ham
sandwich
anyway um
and that made me so mad because i'm
professional enough the things my
husband sends me don't bother anyone
like literally false
they do bother her i'm not saying that
means it's right but like why are you
lying if you have such a good position
if you're are if you have the high
ground
then why do you need to make stuff up to
try to make your argument stronger
they're not a distraction to me either
but according to her they are so i told
her that it's not my fault she's single
and does not receive anything from
anyone that maybe if she were not so
bitter someone would at least send her a
coffee and she got angry and now she
told everyone i was rooted if i don't
apologize she will talk to hr to see
what they can do with me when i told her
i didn't think of being single as a bad
thing i only said it because she sounded
like an envious person
apparently what i said hurt her wow okay
so you blew her out if we're if we're
debating who won
in the argument you won you landed the
the uppercut straight to the glass jaw
she's down for the count
i lose a little bit of respect
because then you said being single's not
a bad thing when you clearly used it as
like a
you know as a hammer blow to knock her
to knock her ass to the mat
um
yeah the king solomon solution
is get your husband to send her some
coffee
you think that would make her feel
better if
her co-workers husband started giving
her some coffee
oh man
yeah i don't know like i i recognize
that i'm not
in uh
the plurality here
with respect to chat
i think
i honestly i'm putting myself in the 35
i think this isn't everybody sucks here
i don't think she's the [ __ ]
because i mean like it's nice for her
i would be uncomfortable
getting so many gifts but some people
love that kind of attention and i'm not
looking at that as like a moral judgment
um
so if she likes it so be it
who cares you know she's getting coffee
she's getting food whatever life goes on
um but at the same time i can totally
understand
why someone else would be annoyed i
wouldn't be
i mean i would be jealous of breakfast
for lunch whatever breakfast sometimes
you go into work you don't have a lot of
time you didn't get to eat before the
before the stream oh life's so hard i'm
so busy um et cetera et cetera uh
somebody cracks open the mcdonald's big
breakfast with the hot cakes and the
sausage patties stinking up the whole
joint your stomach's growling i can see
why you would be annoyed by that um at
lunch whatever as long as i can eat a
ham sandwich who cares that doesn't
bother me
but i can see how it would bother other
people
but i think you just kind of kind of
suck it up
and when i say everybody sucks here i
really do mean everybody sucks here
i think the i think the op
sucks for
hitting the nuclear option i think the
co-worker sucks for being like openly
jealous the the photo about or the the
thing about not allowing your kids
photos there is just insane that's like
every office ever has that
not having your kill i mean what i mean
are the kids photos like them in kiss
makeup or something even then it's not
bad but like if it's just them like
pardon me in their backyard with their
golden retriever or something and like
who cares
um
that would be sick man
they were in the psycho circus or at the
magic the gathering of the juggalos um
i also think the husband is a is
a little [ __ ]
he's just i look okay maybe this
reflects poorly on me maybe this
reflects positively on me but i think
when someone tries this hard
it's scary
like something
if if if they do little gestures that
are like you know whatever and i'm not
saying he's a killer but it reminds me
of like dirty john you know where he's
like oh he's like such a nice guy wow
he's so good with everybody oh he's
threatened to kill my daughter ah
whatever like we're in love oh he tried
to kill my daughter okay oh well you
know like it's just whenever someone's
like
like for me
this is
someone's fake idea
of being a good husband with the volume
cranked to 100
like the the id and maybe it's different
from person to person but the ideal
partner
in my mind is not somebody who gives me
you know gifts
every single day multiple times a day
because then i i don't know it just
seems weird to me it's you know
occasionally they come in and go hey you
know i'm thinking about you here you go
here you go
like i don't know it seems like too
transactional to me
like you and
again this is mostly for argument's sake
right like i'm not trying to play the if
you flip the script card but like if you
were at your office and your co-worker's
girlfriend
got him gifts two to three times a day
would you be like she's a great
girlfriend or would you be like be
careful she's going to
you're gonna do something wrong that you
didn't even know was wrong and she's
gonna actually kill you in your sleep i
would maybe it's a gender bias on my
part i would be like i'm a little scared
for you because that
it seems like the intensity is cranked
up to infinity on this one
it seems like everything's happening in
those extreme margins at least
the husband has just played a lot of
of dating sims maybe
prezis
love is dead for for ryan excuse me it's
like a a a
manga reader's
view on love is that it's uh
you buy me
uh
you know
scotch and i buy you like ice cream
parfaits or something like that
she loves the beach so i bought her 10
parasols right like that's not the
relationship is you know i'm sure for
some people this it's different than for
other people but it's like you know it's
more about supporting
each other in in what you do and like
you know being accommodating and being
there for one another it's not
you know you it's not
buying hey what you can't be mad at me i
buy you 30 coffees
oh wow you weren't complaining when i
bought you those 30 coffees last month
you know this is like
it i don't know it was just weird
at some point i think i would be like i
can just get my own coffee every day
don't like you're it's not even about
the money it's like just about like like
multiple times a day you're getting
stuff delivered in my office like just
get a to go golfing or something like i
don't know like just
let let me be my own person for like
seven hours
and then like when we get home we're a
couple and then like that's good
i don't need i don't need to be it's
like you're spying on me with gifts all
day or something i don't it's just weird
to me
it isn't multiple times per day
he usually sends me breakfast
because i can't have breakfast in the
morning
one moment
he usually sends me he sends me gifts at
work every day
my husband sends me gifts at work every
day
chat message
it's
it's not liter it isn't multiple times
today okay he sends me gifts of work
every day he usually sends me breakfast
he also usually sends me rose and a
coffee with a note wishing me a good day
he also sends me chocolates or food for
my favorite restaurant so i ask you
is this not multiple times per day
or is it once per day
they're like hey by the way here's
breakfast and lunch
this is too much man
once per day that the care package
arrives a big amazon box like
even if it is a single box like i think
it's semantic it's multiple gifts
he's very romantic also like totally not
like a serial killer i just hope he has
the dash pass man
jesus christ
go to the comments oh yeah sorry my bad
everybody sucks here she may be jealous
and should not have said anything you
replied with a personal attack which
puts you on the same level as a random
person i just have to say it's weird
that your husband sends a gift to your
place of work every single day since you
met each other that's not romance that's
peeing on your property so everyone
knows it's taken romance can be public
at times but the workplace is a weirdly
public flex chat blown out i agree
the the the alpha redditor agrees with
me ergo were both right and normal
i would honestly get annoyed if my
husband sent me gifts to work daily and
would ask him to stop
am i the only one who doesn't think
ordering her breakfast is a gift dot dot
dot question mark edit my first awards
omg thanks y'all
this come on
this didn't need to be awarded who's
spending money to
to highlight this am i the o you
highlighted
uh a dae on aita
sdfu
lol
nope i'm here with you he's making sure
she's fed and feels loved
we are so [ __ ] [ __ ] man
we're so [ __ ]
does nobody else see how [ __ ] this is
i'm so [ __ ] up
plus op is pregnant so he's also making
sure his unborn child is cared for
look come on
it's not wrong but the phrasing is like
really good
oh man
you're the [ __ ] every day is
disruptive and your comment was
intentionally cruel and before you start
in on me no i'm not single
i mean that it's a little much but
everybody sucks here sending stuff to
work every day is a bit try-hard and
unprofessional why can't he get you
flowers at home because then you
wouldn't have a commanded audience for
your grand romance i would roll my eyes
as your co-worker too i'm so
it i had to go to reddit to feel normal
i had chad gaslighting me into like i
think romance is dead because i think
it's weird to get
five roses a week at work
i have to go to reddit just to feel like
a normie listen does nobody else see how
messed up this is
anyway she should have ignored it and
when she said something you could have
been less snide i worked with a woman
whose husband sent jewelry and ginormous
florals every major holiday no one
minded this is phyllis from the office
note the top three paragraphs of the po
wait wait wait so no one minded she was
pleasant and got her work done and
wasn't smug
that seems i mean sure major holidays
who's gonna say no to a major holiday
50 years old
owned owned i might get downvoted for
this
but everybody sucks here
i don't i don't read comments to say i
might get downvoted for this you're the
[ __ ] every day isn't romantic it's
obsessive and weird this is feeding me
man
i will never understand the appeal of
wanting a man old enough to be my daddy
you're the [ __ ]
man i feel so smart
not the [ __ ] this is no different to
you ordering food in yourself every day
which a lot of people do this woman
needs to focus more on her own work and
less on what other people are doing
i do respect
um
to some extent them keeping it to the
issue at hand even though i agree
um with the earlier posters it kind of
isn't fair
like if if the husband is actually like
a really nice guy
and he would read this post like he's
like wow i got my wife so many awesome
gifts because she's pregnant i'm just
caring for her and making sure she feels
loved and taking care of my unborn child
uh and then every post on reddit is like
wow this guy's an old [ __ ] pervert
[ __ ] me i guess
you know maybe he's a super nice guy i
have i'm the streamer so you know i can
say whatever i want with no
repercussions i'm just saying like if
you take it at face value we have no
reason to believe he's a bad person i
have my suspicions that notwithstanding
um we don't know it just kind of it kind
of sucks that the age gap element
becomes the focus and this is more of
like a judicial reading of how things
are going that being said it is a 24
year age gap
that's a lot
that is a lot
is it my business well
means she made the post
she didn't have to put the ages in the
post if she if she didn't want to age
the age gap did not there was no reason
for it to be added to the post
except as a cry for help is what i'm
saying it was was the age of her husband
important was it salient when it comes
to him sending the gifts to the office
every day i don't think so
i i think she put it there to be
remarked upon
whoa every single day
good
anyway what are we at 12 54. okay we we
can do we can do a couple more i love
this one am i the [ __ ] for refusing
to leave my class when my teacher kicked
me out for sleeping
so i go to a tech school that starts
very early in the morning i work late
often till 11 pm or midnight so i don't
get more than four hours of sleep during
the first 20 minutes
of class i fell asleep at my desk the
teacher woke me up and told me to leave
i said no since i'm paying for the class
out of my pocket he proceeded to refuse
to teach the class and basically punish
everyone until i decided to leave i
refused to leave some of my classmates
urged the teacher to proceed while
others started to become a bit hostile
towards me and urged me to leave in the
end the lecture wasn't given and i ended
up going to the administrators and
making a formal complaint against the
teacher in question they apologized and
said they would investigate the matter
am i the [ __ ] here you're based uh
not the [ __ ] zero percent zero
percent [ __ ]
honestly like okay
i've been through kindergarten
elementary school middle school
high school
post
high school what do you call it in the
u.s college
[Laughter]
and night class as an adult
and i taught
in korea
children from the age of
i don't know like five to 16 okay
it's
kind of like
being a prison warden
when you're teaching kids in that
like
when the kids have no choice but to be
in the school
you have a
role
as an educator
but also as maintaining the piece you're
like you're like a cop educator
they don't have to be
you know they have no choice you you
have to maintain the order in the
classroom there's an element of like
behavior control and there's an element
of education
i know people are like
no it's not like that tell me you're a
bad teacher without telling me you're a
teacher no you like you just genuinely
don't understand if you let like a class
of eight-year-olds run wild there's
nothing you could do right like you you
gotta
you gotta
respect the fam the silence that serves
as the foundation of learning okay
however
once you get in the college
you just get in you get out
you you don't have
you i'm not going to say you have no
control over what happens in the lecture
hall or in the lab or whatever but like
your amount of control is much lower
because everybody is there presumably
like of their own
volition so if some like if i was
teaching a class of like 20 year olds
and uh
you know one of them fell asleep in the
class i would be like i get paid the
same no matter what it's not like what
is their mom gonna call in and be like
oh jimmy fell asleep in like c-sharp
class okay jimmy
like
don't [ __ ] up your sleep schedule so bad
like what do you want me to do
you want me to run the class like you
want do you want me to move the class
just specifically for jimmy like so it
basically is a situation where like the
teacher
got offended that somebody fell asleep
and uh
took it as like an ego hit and then said
you know i issued an ultimatum that was
like if you don't leave i'm not going to
teach the class and then the kid uh
you know nutted up and
called their bluff honestly the teacher
is this is of extremely bad look for the
teacher they they wagered their pride on
the line and then you put yourself in
the teacher's shoes and you're like
you know they can't be like okay i'm
going to teach the class anyway because
then they i mean that's what they should
have done in retrospect but their bluff
has been called at that point and
they've lost respect which really
doesn't matter if you're just teaching a
class a night class of kids or like a
tech class regardless uh at like a
post-secondary institution but
like
i mean the teacher just
the student didn't do anything wrong
they fell asleep who cares
even if like if like a 10 year old falls
asleep in your class you shouldn't be
like you know hey wake up
you know
i mean maybe you should like
politely be like hey wake up wake up you
know
why didn't you get any sleep last night
is everything okay at home
but if they're like 20 then you just
teach the class or they who cares
they get paid the same no matter what
i mean this is like this is the most cut
and dry am i the [ __ ] i've ever seen
in my life
like you're going to tell an adult that
you're not going to teach the class
unless you leave like who's the baby
here
that's their quote even even if they do
a bad job they still get the two million
that's actually like
is one of the great things about going
in night class i i had some great
professors
i also had some professors where i was
like i think if i was 16 i would be like
well they're an adult maybe they know
what they're doing when i was taking
night class at 30 i was like this person
is a
[ __ ] up this person has no they well
when you have a good professor i'm like
whatever it's just it's a pleasure to be
here but there are some times where
you know
the professor would be like well that's
not the way it works in industry and in
my head i'd be like i can see your
linkedin profile [ __ ] you've been
teaching full-time here since like 1995
what do you know about private industry
like i'm not saying you don't know more
than me you obviously know more than me
but why are you trying to flex like oh
this is how they do it at sap or
whatever when you've been working at
this school since you know the clinton
administration you don't have to lie to
get your point across just give people
the answer without being a smart ass
or i'll take your chili pepper away on
raid my professors
if i worked there
that's too far
come on there's got to be one good one
i'm glad i've never seen that one yet
[Laughter]
this just the title on this one is so
bad am i the [ __ ] for only paying a
portion of my son's college even though
he had money from his dead brother's
college fund
why why would you for you could put like
some velvet on that one that's too much
man
am i oh here we go am i the [ __ ] for
saying i don't give a damn about your
kids let's let's get let's get spicy
okay to finish it off
i'm a kindergarten teacher my job is
mostly taking care of and entertaining
little kids are you gonna say you're
going to say she's a bastard chad
because she has to maintain order in a
classroom of little children
yep
wesley snipes meme photo me when i have
to kill tony hawk when the race war
breaks out tears going down my eyes
we got a lot of good memes today
the issue was oh wait hold on i like
kids but i don't want my own i'm happy
enough to play with them from ten to six
and call it a day from ten to six
what
is that normal
i'm pretty sure that my kindergarten
started at like 8 a.m and it went to
like noon
it's nine to five offset by one
over here okay kindergartens i know it's
an eight-hour workday i'm just saying
it's a lot of putting the kids in the
in kindergarten for eight hours
i'm pretty sure when i went to
kindergarten it was like one week you
went monday wednesday friday for four
hours and the next week you went tuesday
thursday for for four hours
in ontario it's full day now too really
i mean i guess it's kind of like daycare
so it makes trust honestly i'm i'm
looking at this not as like those poor
kids i'm like oh man that's gonna make
things a lot easier for me
[Laughter]
look i only had 12 hours of kindergarten
a week and i turned out okay
it's just like a mini mall come shop you
said flea market
i turned out just fine does nobody else
see how [ __ ] this is
um the issue was last weekend i met my
friend sharon
and see i'm fine
totally normal person and she was
talking about her nephew a lot
i know she loves her nephew like her own
and we even jokingly call him sharon's
son in each meeting i see new pictures
and stories about the little boy most
days i don't mind but i work with kids
monday to friday and a little boy
sharing a cookie with a friend and being
oh so kind is really not impressive to
me
that's
completely fair i understand kids are
not that impressive they are funny
quirky and each one of them has unique
sides to them but they are just small
humans doing regular things during our
chat sharon said wait i got a funny pic
of my nephew on a swing let me find it
so i jokingly said that's the 80th
picture wow which sparked an argument by
the way i still don't think that
she's done anything wrong here
she dropped a hint which was please
don't show me this damn photo
wow that's the 80th photo
look i'm not saying it's subtle at the
same time that's a comment that's like
i'm saying i don't want to see anymore
without saying i don't want to see
anymore
that's the way communication works
you drop a hint like that
and then you know the person then has
their own decision to make about whether
they're still going to push it a step
further
i said i'm sorry i don't give a damn
about your kid i'm here to have a drink
and have an adult conversation i see
them on a swing every [ __ ] day
look you're not a
you didn't serve in nom
like i'm sure it's frustrating but like
that's a little
i don't think you're
wrong like
in principle but the phrasing is like
come on let's take it a little seriously
which she said you're awful i feel bad
for the kids you take care of that's not
fair that is not a fair reply either
sometimes people do that to me i say i
would think it would be weird if i
got sent a rose at work every day people
are like i feel bad for your wife and
i'm like i feel bad for your wife if she
existed
hey yo
uh but she doesn't
uh or her name is pamela henderson
uh hello uh or it's mouth's mom i don't
know i'm trying to figure out what
direction we're going in
sorry pamela henderson pamela
leave him
out of this
sorry sorry mouse mom is a nice lady
yeah you're right she's too good for
chat i don't know what i was thinking
um you can't say you're awful i feel bad
for the kids you take care of that's not
look okay if you work as a dishwasher 40
hours a week
and then you like when you get home
you're like i don't really want to do
the dishes right now your spouse was
like i feel bad for the dishes you do at
work you just give them the middle
finger or something right
minus two it's not a joke
i'm just saying sometimes what you do at
work you're gonna be like you don't
wanna see it outside of work you know i
finish work like i still play video
games but i don't like i try not to read
too much twitch [ __ ]
the last thing i want to do when my when
i finish my stream is like you know
go read a bunch of comments about what
people said about it like it's crazy i
just i just went through five hours of
the fire hose
everything that comes out of your mouth
people are like 6.5 out of 10 on that
sentence personally i would have uh i
would have added a little bit more flair
to the semicolon area of the sentence
and then you know yeah i just like to
get outside listen to some podcasts
walk around a little bit get some fresh
air
um perhaps a little bit more sodium
chloride next time
um yeah the mood was dead soon after we
went on our way so reddit am i the
[ __ ] our friends are divided a bit
while they stay out of it something that
was too harsh but right to call her out
on it some people think i'm the [ __ ]
who broke her heart i heard she's
expecting an apology for me and i'm
willing to give her one if she can also
admit her fault i'll give a bit of
subtext
i didn't just blow up at her after she
got offended by my comment i told her we
should tone down the kid talk and she
said it's not hurting anyone or nephew's
a great kid and me eventually snapping
like this i didn't just blow up on her
but i just got irritated quickly when
she started to talk about how great her
nephew is even in the argument can i be
straight up with you this might be
unexpected
i think if op is telling it like it
actually happened op not the [ __ ]
this
it happens to me now and then you know
some i i'm believe it or not maybe not
on twitch
but otherwise i'm a polite guy okay like
in in the real world
sometimes people will if we're
comfortable they'll talk to me if
they're talking about something that i
find annoying or disinterested
i will
be polite
make conversation
after a certain amount of time if the
conversation is not ending
i'll start to do the thing where i drop
hints right like
well
at least you're not dead
you know at least you're not focused on
it or something like it's hard to come
up with an abstract one like out of
context but like at some point you're
like well you know at least it's over
with and then they keep going and going
and going and like well you know
i'm not sure that's appropriate topic of
conversation for now wow wow it keeps
going on and on and then eventually it
puts you into a position where you're
like you know
i would like you to change the subject
here and then you're the [ __ ] even
though you were dropping little bread
crumbs throughout the discussion to be
like let's
you know
let's let's move on to something that's
less annoying or like more interesting
than me
so this [ __ ] pisses me off you might
think that because i have a kid i would
be like wow ops being a jerk i'm
actually like looking at this from the
perspective of somebody who is talking
you know to people in conversation she
said wow that's the 80th photo
nothing wrong with that if i was showing
photos of my of my baby and then someone
said wow it's the 80th photo i would be
like all right i get it i just find her
cute and then we'll have some drinks
that would be a fun time but as soon as
somebody drops that hint
and you steamroll and say
i'm not hurting anyone my nephew is a
great kid even though you've expressed
that you don't want to see the photos
i'm just going to show them to you
anyway that's messed up man that's like
that's a shot on the bow
like is aren't you showing someone the
photos so that they can see the photo
not that you can show them the photo at
least that's supposed to be the fiction
that we're both laboring under oh wow
she's got peanut butter on her mouth
right
i get that she wants to show the photo
but you're you're laboring under a
bubble delusion that they the other
person also wants to receive the photo
if the other person's like i don't want
to see it anymore you got to stop
showing the photo otherwise you're the
[ __ ] op not the [ __ ]
whether you're a kindergarten teacher or
not
not the [ __ ]
saw an l at the whole foods on robson
hold on this is a good one said hi and
he spat in my face and called me a [ __ ]
you know it's a lie because any time i
go down to robson i'm not grocery

your city your rules exactly
gotta deal with that parking too not
worth come on man you gotta deal with
that park what are you talking about
there's a there's a lot
right uh in the dumbo in the the hanam
supermarket there's a lot in the alley
behind look i'm gonna tell it's it's
supposed to be like three dollars an
hour
but it's free
if
you shop at hanum but they're not gonna
check that like if you're there at night
they're not gonna check that you just
parked there and like they're gonna
assume that you're going to haunt them
now someone might smash your window
and steal a quarter out of your
out of your cup holder
but that's on you for leaving a quarter
in your cup holder when you parked in
downtown vancouver
that's you should know by now you're the
[ __ ] well everybody sucks here
anyway um yeah in this one op
not the [ __ ] imo not the [ __ ]
i did i got spotted at a grocery store
um
last weekend
i got in line for the self checkout
and there was a a
a person in front of me
i was stunned i had a hat
i had sunglasses and i had a mask
and they were like ryan and i was like
you got me
[Laughter]
they were very nice though they were
like well so this is the grocery store
and i was like it's one of them
it's one of them
and then they said that's such a weird
coincidence i was just watching the jug
meat stream
and i was like that's cool
it was good
i've seen you downtown like two times in
10 years but i never said hi it no it
probably wasn't me it was probably just
another like 510 195
bald guy wearing a baseball head pushing
a stroller
who walks on his toes
and is writing down everything that
happens in a moleskin this person why
don't you [ __ ] hate it when people
rush to walk in front of you and then
they slow down anytime someone walks in
front of me i immediately start
tailgating them and then i pass them
again and then i slow down
anybody else hate when you go to the
movies why is the floor so damn sticky
[Laughter]
i just keep it all up here man i just
keep it all up here
oh like you're doing right now
and why do they make them so small
anyway i



welcome back it's react court i'm
excited to be here it's been a week
um by a millennial voice it has been a
week strap in and get ready to read
thread emoji one of x so i was going to
work yesterday on the subway which i
often do go to work on the subway love
going to the subway one of the best
parts of living in new york two of x
okay you get the idea
first tweet has 15 000 retweets second
tweet has 800.
um
we're back to react court and and i'm
ready i'm ready to judge it's been a bit
let's start with the top post
everyone sucks here am i the [ __ ] for
telling a girl
that she is responsible for her own
failures
this seems like the kind of thing that
reddit would honestly uh eat up
i feel like they would be like this is
very this is very based
my girlfriend no my friends my roommates
friends sorry i went through about 17
different steps there
my roommate's friend my 22f roommate's
friend 22f is always complaining about
how unfair
life is
and how hard it is to find internships
she always whines about nepotism and
connections and blames everyone else for
her shortcomings she's also jealous of
me because i've made smart choices all
throughout college and recently secured
a well-playing job
well-paying job i can read i promise at
a consulting company for after we
graduate she started moaning about how
she can't get a job because she's
unconnected i outlined to her exactly
how i got my position i competed for
entrance in the best pre-professional
organizations based around consulting as
a freshman and since then i've been
networking and gaining internships to
experience and experience to secure
a high paying position
i'll have you know i have over 300
confirmed
get pushes
to the production branch
i graduated top of my class at khan
academy
she could have done the same but she
chose not to it has nothing to do with
unfairness or connections she just
didn't hustle throughout college didn't
network didn't make smart choices like i
did the problem is that she failed
personally not that life isn't fair and
frankly even if it was she should stop
crying about it and get to work she
hates me even more now okay okay
look
i can't believe we're we're here on
episode one
but like
i right off the bat with no extra
context i do not feel comfortable saying
everybody sucks here
everybody seems to largely be in
agreement that even if you think that
he's right this is an [ __ ] move
okay
like to when when she's complaining
about stuff and you just go
oh actually you know i i grinded uh you
know myself i was gonna say down to the
bone but that's not necessarily fair you
know if you work hard you get uh
rewarded for it sometimes but not with
you know one-to-one relationship the
fairness necessarily
um
but either way i'm i'm stunned at the
everybody sucks your votes both in chat
and in the
although to be honest there's not that
many
proportionally in the actual ledger here
um
because
there is like you got to consider the
environment that you're into okay
if three friends of a similar age are
around and they're complaining like oh
nepotism all connections you're not an
[ __ ] even if you just complain about
stuff that's not necessarily true to try
to create some relatability people come
like you have casual complaining
conversations with your peers all the
time i know it you know when you're
talking to your parents you're like yes
sir yes yes sir yes sir when you're
talking to your friends you're like
literally every problem on earth is
created by people that are over the age
of 55 even if they had no impact on
global politics whatsoever right so like
i you you
tailor what you're saying in different
situations not everything is an
invitation to be like hey you know
attack the position that i'm holding
true just for having
you know a conversation here
um
so even
if you think she's very wrong if you're
not engaging in a
debate to come at her like this it makes
you the [ __ ] just because you're
responding to like you know some griping
with like actually personal attacks
essentially um
now
the the one thing i would say
uh to to the op
is that
you're 22 years old
like i i get how it goes man like
you know that probably seems old oh i'm
so old
i'm so old i'm feeling nostalgia for the
first time oh man
like there there are actually there's
one generation of kids that are younger
than me that are in like sixth grade
right now i'm so old um but you're not
actually that old 22 is like you're a
little baby you're just getting started
you know you you're just getting out of
college to to to say that she failed
personally
is a little crazy you know like it's a
long race
where where you're at at 22 has some
influence i'm sure where you're going to
be at when you're like 50 but you got a
long way to go you know i take it from
me you know some of the people
in in my life that i knew that were
you know at 22 they were a little bit
quote unquote behind
now they're doing just fine some of the
people who were killing it at 22 you
know they got to be 30 and then they
said i don't really want to you know be
this kind of like rise and grind person
anymore i'm gonna actually take a step
back from the rat race if i have the
opportunity and and chill out a little
bit so i mean it's
it this seems like a situation where
well i mean if i can i just be rude like
i kind of feel like
op is uh
hyper fixated on academic and
professional success and they sound like
a kind of a huge nerd with
uh
maybe
limited social skills that chafe
everybody else around them just based on
the on the way that they responded to
this
essentially
um the rest of their replies are even
worse well maybe there's a teachable
moment here
um
you're the [ __ ] mainly because so i'm
saying you're the [ __ ] i'll make my
verdict okay
um
you're the [ __ ] you sound
self-righteous completely oblivious to
others in their circumstances she's
right life actually is unfair her main
complaint was about connections and you
specifically said you networked your way
to internship so it sounds like your
opportunities are based on connections i
mean i think that's true like um
i think look
i complain
well you got to be careful about the way
that you phrase this all right
there are people in my life who complain
more about life being unfair than me
but i do also think
you know life has been unfair in a
positive way for me
i i attribute like a lot of
not just my own success but a lot of
success in general just comes down to
kind of like luck and and variance if
that makes sense like i can think of a
number of circumstances like the the
first job i got
at goodwill was on merit i was a warm
body basically
um but then like the next summer
i basically got a job
because my mom knew so well i got an
interview because my mom knew somebody
who worked at the company
and then i
i for for years i was like i nailed the
interview
[Laughter]
and then uh you know you get a little
older and you're like probably maybe you
did but you know at the same time
it's uh
you know you probably had an extra foot
in the door and then the job i worked
for the next two summers uh i also
had a
a family member who worked at the
company so i again i was like man i'm
really good at interviewing like i've
only had like five job interviews in my
life and i've gotten the job four times
that's crazy like i must i must be
really impressive in the in the
interview process but then on you know
when it comes to youtube it's the same
thing as well there are people who work
way less hard than me maybe they work
smarter maybe maybe they don't but
they're more successful and there's
people who have like grinded
their you know what off and they're not
as successful
and some of that is due to like a a
convoluted meritocracy where like the
most entertaining stuff has a tendency
to do better and some of it is just like
well
you know you happen to be born in the
late 80s which meant when youtube was
taken off you had the space to actually
dedicate some time to it and then these
people on the other hand were born in
like you know 1973
and they had three kids that were going
to college when youtube was taking off
so even if their dream was to
uh
become a full-time youtuber they
couldn't afford to quit their full-time
job to make it happen because they would
have been destitute so
essentially like there's a lot of stuff
that you can't control there's there's a
lot of stuff you can control
but there's a lot of stuff that you
can't control as well so i think being
deluded into the idea that it's like a
full
you know meritocracy is a little
ridiculous
but
i do also understand i mean like i know
or have known people in my life that are
like you know
life's not fair and you're like well do
you ever consider like changing the way
you work and they're like
no and you're like okay
what you do is you don't go well then
you don't have a right to complain you
just go if i'm gonna maintain a
friendship with this person when they
complain in my head i'll be like well
you could do something to change it but
what you say to them is
yeah it sucks you know you just be
sympathetic because they're a friend of
yours
anyway
that's that's my two cents
just yeah try to be supportive
also she's 22. she'll figure it like
like six years ago she was in 10th grade
you expect her to have her have her
whole life figured out at 22.
like you you you can't i i wouldn't and
i know some people in a chat are like in
their early 20s they're like i'm an
adult you might be like you did like
legally obviously but you genuinely
might be like from a maturity standpoint
but also like i as a 32 year old i
wouldn't trust a 22 year old with a with
a menu
much less like
to have the the philosophy of what they
want to do in their life figured out in
an ironclad sense
you know for life
yeah you can't even rent a car until
you're 25 man
everybody sucks here
yes a user received
reddit platinum for this post
you are demonstrating textbook
survivorship bias the idea that
everything fell on your lap because you
worked hard ignores the very real luck
factor yeah i mean
and now i'm just like getting into my
own
like everyone loves to talk about
themselves right it took me a while to
realize this on youtube as well like i
was like you know yeah youtube sucks but
you know it worked out for me all i had
to do was you know
you you don't know
that you're the plane that comes back
with the bullet holes or if you're like
the plane that was built different and
as a result didn't get shot in the first
place you know
this this so much this user received
gold for this post this this
anyway i i mean i i think this there's
there's tons of examples of people that
have i and i think about this on youtube
and twitch a lot there's tons of
examples of people on twitch that
you know have been streaming for 10
years uh have hustled
read uh you know how-to guides about how
to make their stream better have the
perfect lighting set up uh you know try
to network et cetera et cetera and then
you know 10 years later they're in
basically the same spot that they were
uh
you know when they started and
some of that is just basically due to
like
you know you you can't always especially
in in a business
i i think like this you can't always
guarantee that hustling is always gonna
pay out you know i think it gives you a
better
chance for it to pay out but there's
also there's a lot of luck and there's a
lot of there's a lot of variance anyway
that's
fair enough
i this one dude i'm like
this one puts me in a weird
it's a weird position that's not true if
you ask daniel well here's here's where
i take on what i take on that issue okay
i dan and i have and we ran you know
check the wire together um so i think we
we have a similar idea
which is that if you
um the the way you give yourself the
best chance is by
working
you know as hard as you feel comfortable
as smart as you can
uh and and you know just consistently
doing that for like a long time
um
but i think
it's
i think in and again damn i'd even be
here you can feel free to disagree with
this it's not rude i think it's a
good it's a productive mindset
to believe that everything is within
your control in that sense
you know i'm a little bit more cynical
so like in my head
i'm like you can you have control over a
certain percentage and then a lot of it
is basically up to kismet but i think
that
you know it you you probably it it's
like a useful delusion
i think
if you're like i have complete control
over everything because then i think uh
you know that that delusion keeps some
doubt from popping in which allows you
to probably have a better chance but
anyway
that's that that's my thoughts on that
am i the [ __ ] for getting mad at a
guy for sending my girlfriend 500
flowers for her birthday
500 flowers is uh
it's a lot
that's a lot
i but i mean is it a guy or is it like
you know her best friend for life or
something like that
i would i would just be really
uncomfortable i think i hold on let's
just well
okay hold on is it one of those cool
orchids from like adaptation
like that john laroche had to harvest
illegally from a national park
hey bin setsu thank you
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank you i i had uh it took a lot of
grinder to get these views man if you if
you hustle like i hustle you too can
have people randomly dropping in and
generously giving out 10 gifted
subscriptions based entirely on merit
and nothing else
this thread has been lo oh they're all
locked so that's not uncommon
i know for a fact he's just a friend so
no comments about that i'm sure the
point is something else i'm upset
because they're better flowers than i
can afford for her birthday so anything
i get for her will be a pity she posted
it on instagram for everybody to see and
she is going to tell people there from
me and have me lie if somebody asks
they're roses too she picked the color
ahead of time so she knew they were
coming that's just really sad
so her friend
did you say he's just a friend
but look i don't know maybe that's true
your friend spent 500 on flowers gave
them to your girlfriend your girlfriend
posted them on instagram
and lied to say that her boyfriend got
them for her
that's so sad for the friend and for the
boyfriend
it's
anyway
um
he runs a flower he runs a flower store
so he was able to get them cheaper than
normal which is why
she said this is normal i got extremely
jealous
and was about to message him telling him
hey i respect your friendship but this
is too much
gf stopped me asked if i was crazy my
problem is with her not him if i don't
like it am i the [ __ ]
market value is over 1k i was being
generous to him he's not a florist but
he's a married a married
multi-millionaire who's just a partner
in the business that sells these flowers
i forgot how to read this weekend i
realized edit edit very interesting mix
of responses here gold really down votes
really fully admit i'm the [ __ ] for
wanting to message him but was surprised
how many people think it's okay for a
man married but flexible
and every every edit gets like stranger
first he's a friend then he's a florist
and he's a married married a married
multi-millionaire and now he's got an
open relationship okay to send over 100
000 worth of roses to another man's
girlfriend also very surprised at how
few people think roses are a romantic
gift you all grew up in a different
world than i did appreciate the kind and
understanding appreciate the people who
agreed with me
uh already resolved it by apologizing
for trying to text him but told her i
still think it's an inappropriate gift
thanks all here's here's all i'm gonna
say okay
like
i must have misspoke did i say a hundred
thousand dollars in roses my mistake
i told you i forgot how to read this
weekend um
yes you did okay well it's a thousand my
mistake i mean a hundred 000 is
ridiculous a thousand that's just like a
normal wednesday i'm i i spend so much
money at the florist like come on a
hundred thousand
what is what is it uh you know
your your mid anniversary
everybody sucks here because he keeps
changing his story i'm so crazy yeah
like a hundred thousand dollars is just
like a hundred dollars to me and squid
game is just like a game
i did like the reply i got on twitter
where i told hassan to watch the hunger
games if he likes uh
if you like squid game and then somebody
replied i'm so hungry the hunger games
are just like a game to me
it's pretty good anyway um
overall
i mean let me say something here okay
i think
let's assume that we're taking him at
face value and
like he's genuinely uh a
married multi-millionaire is a weird
phrase to say okay it's not just a bad
brain married multi-millionaire
let's assume that he is a married
multi-millionaire who's just a friend he
doesn't want to
engage in romantic overtures with this
guy's girlfriend um
i don't think that a
a thousand well if you know 500 dollars
in roses
is that crazy
like rich people like that they kind of
live in a different world you know
you keep like a ledger in your head if
you pay for somebody's if you're a
normie you pay for somebody's like
mcdonald's order it'll be like four
years later you'll be like hey you think
you could get this starbucks for me
because i bought that mcdonald's for you
back in 2017.
but if you're like
in the one percent of the maybe not the
one percent of the one percent but if
you're in you know if you're if you're
that high up on the on the tax bracket
you know you maybe you spend 500 bucks
on roses you forget about it
like in 10 seconds right
so i i this that doesn't seem crazy to
me
um
when you put themselves in their shoes
but it's very weird that
she
wanted you to lie and say that you
bought
the
roses for her
that's very strange
i don't know if it's like an [ __ ]
move but it's it's
really weird it's just a weird energy i
would be like nah just say like you know
my friend got it for me
my boyfriend is not a married
multi-millionaire see i can say it right
yeah i don't know it's just weird
long story short
you shouldn't be mad at the guy
you should be mad
or at least you have an issue with your
girlfriend
the guy
if we take him at face value he's just a
guy
you know he's just a very wealthy guy
who's like how much could a banana cost
ten
dollars she seems to know the gift is a
little bit over the top and the optics
of it would look bad so we have to lie
about it on social media hey just a
thought by the way like she didn't have
to put it on social media i know that
this is like antithetical
to modern existence and it's like it's
heretical um hey egg parmesan
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
i always i wonder okay because like when
somebody has
50 000 followers
on a social media platform and then they
post something for attention i'm like
yeah that's your job or like at least a
hobby but when people have like
70 followers on social media and i'm
this is not like punching down if
anything it's like aspirational i'm like
if you have 70 followers on instagram
you're s
it's not too late
you can still delete that [ __ ] and get
out you can still you can bail you don't
have to be there
anymore
when people have established it and
woven it into their career path and
stuff like that you kind of you you're
like i just i got to go to this [ __ ]
website again are you uh
having such an awesome day today [ __ ]
i hate this [ __ ] place right if you
got like you know 55 followers on
instagram don't post that [ __ ] like
eight people are gonna see it for one
just delete it and enjoy your time with
your family to enjoy this awesome gift
or something like that
i don't understand
anyway i'm sorry sorry
i apologize
instagram's down right now anyway
you're the [ __ ]
so the issue is that he got her flowers
they're more expensive than what you can
afford who gives a [ __ ] with so
engineering own two two nine nine based
this this so much this user received
reddit bronze for this post a gift isn't
about the cost it's about the thought
put into it and if you continue to
compare dollar amounts you'll always
find someone who can afford more than
you that's true um comparison is the
theft of joy
this is like man
this guy knows what he's doing op knows
what this guy's doing the guy's reading
the thread know what he's doing he wants
to get an op's girlfriend's pants that's
what he's thinking
you're either incredibly naive to think
he's sending that many roses to a woman
because they're just friends or you're
maliciously gaslighting op into thinking
he should be okay with this
op keep this guy at arm's length what
are you going to do
like if they're going to do it they're
going to do it
how are you going to stop it in the
first place good evening keep him at
arm's length
[Laughter]
you know you don't have that much
control over in the whole scheme of
things
roses are a romantic gift in most parts
of the world he's trying to woo her i
mean look there is a non-zero chance
that that's the case but like at the
same time i love the idea that like
hey everything you said about like
knowing that it's not a romantic gesture
just from your post it's a romantic
gesture
you don't
make it illegal for your girlfriend to
ever see this guy ever again
like what are you gonna do
i think everyone can relate to your
feelings
as a result you are not the [ __ ] i
don't know if that's how it works
everyone's acting like it was a damn
chili's gift card and their roses to
boot
the flower most associated with love and
passion is this not relevant
i swear if this post was a girl being
upset her boyfriend bought his friend
who's a girl some flowers it would be
what omg he cheating girl did you have
to write it like that
but since it's a guy everyone's just aw
you jealous this and that double
standards out the wazoo um
i don't know what to say
about that one it's just the way it was
phrased makes me uncomfortable
i don't know if that's true honestly
i i feel like if a married guy
who owned a flower shop
bought a girl
some an extravagant flower gift
i don't think i would look at that as if
he's like putting on airs
i think i would be like of course he got
you flowers this dude owns a damn flower
shop
his name is kushnerd
it's true
do you think it's ivanka's husband
if he owned a flower shop and he bought
her like uh
you know like a ford bronco i'd be like
yo what the hell man
but if it's
if he if he has part ownership of a
flower shop and he got her some nice
flowers that seems like
that seems appropriate
he's an investor in the flower shop yeah
but like that that means he gets you
know he's buying the flowers at cost i'm
assuming
even if he's not buying the flowers it
costs he gets a refund when he buys them
you know because he owns you know let's
say 30 of the shop or something
so it's already it's already a discount
no matter what
what if he bought her a peloton and now
we're talking
if he buy if he owns a flower shop he
knows what roses mean as a gift yeah but
like look i understand that but i'm also
like that's kind of [ __ ] you know
sometimes the flower is just the flower
like if she just likes roses you know it
doesn't mean
i don't you know it's kind of like a
dream journal thing to me you know
sometimes when you dream about falling
it means that you have anxiety over like
an impending
stress and sometimes it just means you
know you were you dreamt that you were
on the rings of saturn and you fell
through like
just happens man anyway the other thing
is again i feel like there's an extra
element here of like
you know
what are you gonna do
okay maybe he's trying to like seduce
her you're not the [ __ ] but like i'm
not sure what your what your practice is
gonna be from this point onwards like
you know
you kind of just gotta roll with the
punches and then you know act with
integrity from that point onwards i
guess
in what world is it appropriate to buy
someone i mean like look it is we i i
would feel
similar to op that's why i said op
is is only the [ __ ] for taking it up
with the guy i think it's it's
appropriate for the girlfriend to be
like hey you should
thanks for the flowers next time do not
give me
such an extravagant gift because it's a
little weird
so i don't think it makes opie the bad
guy
that he's mad i think him having the
issue with
the his rival is kind of the
the that's the issue that maybe makes
him the [ __ ] whereas it it's really
it falls on his girlfriend to be like
hey please
you know don't do that in the future
also lying on social media is super
weird hello jay by the way hello
new glasses who it is now these are the
same glasses it's uh
i'm just using a filter this is a
tick-tock it's called the ceo filter on
tick-tock
am i the [ __ ] for telling my husband
we're not spending christmas with him
this one just seems like it's gonna be
sad
am i the [ __ ] for telling my husband
we aren't spending christmas with him
today my husband and i got into a huge
fight about christmas in particular
santa
okay because i'm assuming you have a
child and you want to tell them that
santa is real and your husband doesn't
because he's a stem lord that's just my
guess um okay not not a stem lord
appears to just have a different
religion but anyway christmas has always
been a huge part of my life it's my
favorite time of the year i believed in
santa until i was 10 or 11. chat close
your ears
i by the way i believed in santa until i
was
12 i think i've told this story before
but
uh
my parents went out one saturday to buy
groceries i was just home alone at age
11 or 12. um
and then
when they came back it was like march
right they were like we got to tell you
something the easter bunny's not real
and i was like yeah that makes sense
like i'm 11 i'm not an idiot and then
after that
i said you know
it really makes you wonder about santa
claus as well
and they kind of they went okay
look look look we plead the fifth on
that one you got us
etc etc so that that's where it all fell
apart for me
it's a very only child story that makes
sense yeah i i'm not mad like
[Laughter]
it's not like it really inhibited my my
life too much um
but anyway 10 11 i'm sure is late but
it's not that crazy i asked a lot of
questions and was told by other kids
that he wasn't real until i admittedly
knew deep down but just loved the magic
of it all i still do my husband chris
i am assuming asterisk means name is
changed to protect the innocent
uh never celebrated christmas as he is a
muslim he only started participating
when we met 11 years ago he knows how
important christmas is to me every year
we go to the christmas events light
looking the whole works our son louis is
for
chris chris kringle perhaps and my son
um saint nicholas
he's very articulate and has started
talking about christmas and santa in
particular writing him a letter i told
him it was a bit early but that we would
definitely do that closer to christmas
then i left for work i came home nine
hours later and lewis was acting strange
he wasn't crying but was clearly upset
i presumed he had gotten in trouble
because he was acting similar to if he'd
been scolded or gone to timeout i asked
chris why lewis was upset and after some
pressing chris told me that he told
lewis santa wasn't real he told lewis
that santa was based on saint nicholas
and how he was turkish just like daddy
look i don't i don't know if that's true
but that's just a very funny thing to to
say
and be like you know i'm gonna blow up
this kid's whole spot i'm gonna i'm
gonna i'm gonna blow up this kid's
illusion of the world just to tell him
that santa and his dad are the same
ethnicity
i lost my mind we had previously agreed
not to tell lewis that santa wasn't real
until he started asking questions about
whether or not he was real the magic i
experienced my son during christmas is
so special and i'm angry my husband is
prematurely taking it away
i'm angry that he has ruined my child's
magic when it comes to christmas my
husband showed absolutely no remorse
said i'm an [ __ ] told me it's not a
big deal i feel like if roles were
reversed and i'd said something about
ramadan or something he values he'd be
furious okay
but
look i know i know where i'm going with
this one
but like
christmas has a religious significance
but santa doesn't have a religious
significance
you know it's like
it's chris christmas is you know
celebration of the birth of jesus christ
on a religious level
santa's just like a guy santa's like the
the hallmark jesus christ
he's like he was invented by like toys r
us right at least in his modern sense
what are you gonna make up about about
ramadan like
you're gonna be like yeah john ramadan's
not real what are you talking about
he was invented by coca-cola yeah that's
that's what i'm saying man you're
blowing up
warren buffett's spot like you're not
you know it's it's on a different level
i told my husband that lewis and i would
be spending christmas in my hometown
this year four hours away and then he
wasn't invited if he was gonna be a buzz
kill he's a good husband and father but
his lack of remorse or care for
something i value has made me furious he
thinks i'm overreacting okay here come
the edits
lewis has not asked if santa was real
but it was instead talking about the
north pole and my husband decided it was
a great time to tell him santa isn't
real and saint nicholas is turkish like
him
i don't think i was clear in my post um
but i'm upset that he undermined me and
our agreement and was without discussing
with me i feel blindsided and like what
i value doesn't matter husband okay yes
i mean
like
headed for we are divorced now
um
look
i'm
this is a tough one okay
i genuinely even though it's kind of a
funny one
it's also kind of a tough one
you can't just be like
hey everything in our marriage is
totally fine you're like a great dad and
a great husband but you're not invited
to christmas like that's
that's over the line it's uh that's the
sp that's like the the most well you
know it depends it's wrapped up in
culture and it's wrapped up in religion
but at least in
you know i mean i'm an atheist and
christmas is like the holiday that i
hold most sacred because my family gets
the most time off
so it's kind of something about that
december environment is
you know
it's it's sacred in an extent like the
idea that you're like 11 months of the
year we're married but like that one
month of the year that is like perhaps
the one of the most important we're like
you just like live on your own for that
one
um
and also what about his presence right
uh you can't just you can't cancel the
prezis on him
but
he also
definitely did something he shouldn't
have done
ignoring the fact that at some point the
child will find out that
santa's not real to begin with
you know if they had an agreement that
they were gonna tell him when he's four
who cares if they had an agreement
they're not going to tell him until he's
18 who cares well that's funny but who
cares but
him just being like oh by the way
santa's not real but also the guy he's
based on is turkish just like me
is
hilarious
to imagine the conversation but also
it's a it's a [ __ ] move
is my two cents at least i uh
i would say
for me this isn't everybody sucks here
i am oh and i this is the
it's the not the view and the plurality
seems like we got a 66 percent not the
[ __ ] 25 say everybody sucks here i i
look
i don't know i mean
like
you you can't
like you're not invited to christmas is
like
the warning shot you fire before you
serve somebody with divorce papers
which is why i'm like
how can
she be like everything's fine
but you're not allowed to celebrate
christmas with us like that's what's
weird to me that's why i think she's the
[ __ ] in addition to him being the
[ __ ] as well
he def he broached
the bubble first
but she
i mean i think she took it a step too
far now the question is not who's worse
did both people do something wrong
yes i think both people cross the line
now let's see where i diverge from
reddit as a whole
[Laughter]
not the [ __ ] this degree of
maliciousness is really deep jealousy
and envy resentment i don't know but
your husband drew blood with this and
you need to ask him why
what
he drew blood
i just
tell me you watched it's a wonderful
life 75 times uh a year as a child
without telling me you there look i like
christmas there are some people who
re they like like christmas you know
what the kinds of people who are like
and now if you're if you're in this
group this doesn't mean you're crazy i'm
just saying you know like thanksgiving
ends and immediately they're like the
christmas tree grow goes up we're
watching a christmas movie every day uh
throughout november and december except
for the fact that you know there's only
been four good christmas movies ever
made um you know
you get the idea like they turn the
radio station to the christmas music and
they they listen to it for you know 10
of the year even though there's only
been three good christmas songs ever
written so on and so forth
and this
when you she i mean he did really
draw blood it also doesn't really sound
malicious
i mean
you think he was he had like like foam
coming out of his mouth
i'm about to end this kid's whole career
hey did you know santa claus is turkish
what an [ __ ]
i'm really sorry i love this i know
we've never met i'm really sorry
shouldn't have done that i agree with
the top comment the best thing you could
do is talk to him about this
first it would be nice if you posted it
all on reddit so we could all get you
whipped up into a frenzy about how your
husband's a piece of garbage and then
okay but then you should go talk to him
i doubt this is the first time he
sabotages your parental decisions
without telling you that's look he made
a mistake that's too far man
that's j come on
it's like every time you have a
oh hey i said i was going to take the
garbage out oh sorry i got busy i forgot
to take the garbage out how can i ever
trust you ever again what if you say
you're going to be there for me if i get
sick
and then i get i get sick and you forget
about it it's like come on i just
forgot to take the garbage out once
everyone just chill
out your husband is not only an [ __ ]
but he's an ignorant [ __ ]
nicholas was a byzantine greek the turks
didn't show up for a few centuries later
this
based and history pilled
not the [ __ ] you can fix this for
your son by telling him santa only
brings presents to people who believe
he's real so dad never got to have santa
because he never believed and that's why
he thinks santa is fake okay look
i know that chad's gonna be like this is
creating like a weird precedent for your
child
look it's a kid man like if if it works
it works who cares you know you get
bigger problems
you are doubling down on a lie or on the
truth with a lie
but like he's four like
it doesn't matter
it's like
this is not in my opinion at least this
is not where things start becoming
unwound and then like 40 years later
they're like
you know
it all went wrong when they kept feeding
me lies about santa okay
this is whatever
this this doesn't strike me as a big
deal
okay you're not the [ __ ] is it is
anyone gonna talk about the fact that
like
you know disinviting him to christmas is
kind of extreme not the [ __ ] but
unfortunately you're married to one it's
so funny to me because this is like a
this is like a curb your enthusiasm bit
like larry david
accidentally letting people know that uh
you know letting a kid know santa's not
real
and then everybody's like [ __ ] you you
bald [ __ ]
it's not it's a it's a dick move but i'm
like i'm feeling bad for the husband a
little bit here like everybody's going
off man
not the [ __ ] he did it sneakily on
purpose your child was upset did his dad
comfort him at all did he dismiss your
child's feelings as well as yours is
that a good father i don't know anything
about your relationship or your history
except for what you've said and you said
he was a good father but based on this
one post i think you might be a liar
this is crazy man
the husband is confused that that's
probably an understatement
also
at the time the area was greek and is
now on the southern coast of turkey
not the [ __ ]
look i'm i don't disagree with the not
the [ __ ] to an insane extent i'm
just wait look at how many comments we
had to go through before i found you
know somebody that that at least had
some sympathy in this situation for like
he threw the first stone but the
response was also maybe a little over
the top
yes your husband shouldn't have told him
but
instead of taking your son away from
celebrating christmas with his family
you could have spun this another way
talked about the real meaning of
christmas
hey
faris
aulia
thank you so much for the generosity
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank is it christmas
and they said santa wasn't real
and that he's from turkey when actually
he's a byzantine greek
and the the area only became turkish uh
several years later um thank you thank
you
appreciate it
santa brought it early
you could have celebrated the real
meaning of christmas also known as
spending time together with loved ones
yes santa's not real but there's other
things that are in the spirit of santa
generosity kindness happiness
you do realize you're going against that
by taking the kid away from his dad what
you're teaching is that when somebody
makes a mistake we abandon them
ffs that means for friends sake um maybe
this issue goes deeper for your husband
maybe he feels excluded and make a bet
made a bad choice in telling your son
either way you're not gonna solve
anything by threatening to spend the
holidays elsewhere three months in
advance i agree i agree with this
comment
i'm not trying to defend the husband
like
i i think that that's
a it's a [ __ ] move especially if you
promised that you weren't gonna do it
but like the reply to that is crazy
well okay over the top let's not say
crazy but
you know it
disproportionately
aggressive and scored
punitive as compared to the
the the problem in the first place
should september still be in the title
uh well nothing has changed
subscriptions are 20 off for the month
of september
it is um
october 4th but
september is like it's still a thing
it doesn't
it's not really
germaine to the current situation but
[Laughter]
i have calmed down a fair bit now and
can see why he feels excluded from the
whole christmas thing and wanted to bond
with our son by saying that santa was
faking based on saying nick who was
turkish just like my husband it's like
does she have this on the on the
clipboard she have a macro for this
exact sentence
sorry this is not germaine to the
situation um
he's at work but i'm definitely going to
talk to him about whether this is the
case and if it is i'm going to try to
find a way to make him feel more
included we don't live in turkey
so i could definitely empathize with him
missing his home country and potentially
wanting to make that connection between
turkey and something our son loves by
telling him this i do disagree with him
flat out saying santa isn't real
especially without talking to me and i
am still upset
but it's very out of character for him
to be inconsiderate so now that i've
calmed down i can see it's definitely
about something deeper rather than him
just wanting to change up how her son
views christmas without me
absolutely not that's a profoundly
offensive thing to say about a greek
christian like saint nicholas it's
guys guys guys i feel like we're getting
in the weeds here about the
origin of saint nicholas okay
i feel like that's the semantics maybe
it's a different discussion that we can
have at a later date i don't think it's
necessarily relevant to the situation at
hand
saint nicholas was greek
saint nicholas was a roman citizen i
agree
were da vinci and michelangelo italians
most people refer to them as such but
they live long after the italian
unification here's the thing you called
it ejecta
which is not true
a jackdaw is from the genus jackass dos
sorry that's like an ancient reddit
meme from ages ago but um
da vinci
your husband is wrong by the way saint
nicholas was in turkish she was greek
uh depending on how pedantic you want to
get saint nicholas was either roman or
lyceum while he was of greek descent the
region in which he lived in
hadn't been under greek control for over
a hundred years by the time he was born
uh that's like saying jesus was roman or
that cleopatra turned roman after the
roman conquest jesus was a citizen of
judea paul was a roman nicholas was a
roman citizen born about 190 years after
the roman empire took control of lycea
he had greek heritage
just wanted to say i've been loving all
your responses
who [ __ ] cares like
[Laughter]
she pisses me off
okay okay
in germany we celebrate saint nick on
december the 6th kids clean their shoes
or boots and get little gifts of candy
in them maybe you can find a similar
tradition to include the turkish saint
saint nicholas wasn't turkish
hey hey germany
nice tradition
don't care didn't ask plus saint
nicholas wasn't turkish this is this is
crazy man
all right well we've spent too much time
on this one
not that i haven't had a great time with
this one but
oh man
they're really hung up on this saint
nicholas thing
nobody even wants to talk about the fact
that we can all agree
maybe we don't know is he lycee and is
he roman is he turkish is he greek is he
byzantine i don't know what we all know
is that he's got a belly that when he
laughs it rolls like a bowl full of
jelly can we all agree there
can we all agree that he's got a belly
that rolls like a bowl full of jelly
and he hangs out with the polar bears in
the north pole
actually he's lean



and he's not turkish okay
he's drinking cola with the polar bears
man am i the [ __ ] for filing a
conduct report on a co-worker who had
emotion an emotional breakdown
that very much depends i would say
on the situation
what a title a co-worker experienced a
death in their immediate family the day
they returned to work at some point
towards the end of the day as they were
doing a task i asked if they could try
doing the task in x-way instead they
exploded at me and yelled about their
dead family member and how they just
want to scream and cry and don't tell me
what to do i was terrified and shocked i
called our manager in the calm down
calm my co-worker down and our manager
encouraged them to go home they refused
so our manager told them if they were
insistent on staying they'd have to
apologize to me they apologized to me by
apologizing for their family member
dying and again i was shocked and so
uncomfortable and disgusted i explained
to them that i'm sorry to hear about the
death in the family however that is not
my issue and if something in their
personal life is preventing them from
doing their work and they believe
they're allowed to speak to me in that
way because of what's happening then
it's probably for the best so they go
home
the co-worker cut me off and cut me off
and said like you're doing right now
i've said i'm sorry that's it done i'm
not having a conversation about it
i ended up filing a conduct report on
this person
edit
we work with children under four
oh
oh okay like in a daycare or something
cause i thought that
this was like a like a cigar rolling
factory in like the in the 1700s
i was picturing like a bunch of people
on the line and like every third person
was a kid under the age of four or
something
oh
man
okay why would you think that i don't
know i mean
it depends on the definition of work
with right like i'd anchored to the idea
that we're talking about co-workers then
when they say work with in my head i'm
thinking like you know i work with
you know this guy who had an emotional
breakdown and also children under the
age of four
um
anyway
this one's it i hate to say it for me
this one's too cut and dry
your friend is not like or your
co-worker i should say is in the wrong
no question about that and like
you know i hate to say it it's it's
always easier as like a rational
uh
observer with no emotion tied up on the
outside
it's understandable that they blew up if
they're not ready to be back at work um
but then to
have a little bit of time to cool off
and then still be like instead of being
like sorry i'm just upset right now
because of stuff going on in my personal
life instead being like
nah man like
frick you
[ __ ] i think that makes
like they've doubled down on it you can
totally understand why
um
they would be rude
i don't do it honestly like
i don't i don't think ops the [ __ ]
maybe
sure okay look a con
adding a conduct report on the end is
probably too much that like i don't know
what the hell that means
i guess it means that it gets looked at
by hr or something and then they get
possibly reprimanded or written up or
something um
so to like if
i would like to think that if it
happened to me
i would be like you know let's let this
simmer for 24 hours and then i
completely understand why you're upset
let's hash this out i know it's not
about us
that being said i also i mean i don't
feel like ops being too much of a
[ __ ] in this situation
can i say it also depends on
sorry
also depends on what they
backseated as as somebody who gets
backseated on occasion
if they were you know like doing
something unsafe and they were like hey
can you do it like this instead
that's fine
if they were like hey don't tie the kids
shoes like that use the bunny ear method
instead i might be like you know what
listen up you little [ __ ]
i had a hard week
okay i know how to tie my shoes do i i'm
not stupid i'm smarter than you are you
you're gonna try to backs oh hey hey
have you considered hey you ever thought
about doing it this way yeah okay
yeah i thought about it and i decided
uh that's not my problem okay
anyway
i make four times what you make well you
wouldn't know it from your suit
you ruined my life
anyway
i mean this is that's just sad co-worker
probably shouldn't be back at work but
had to be back at work for economic
reasons um
nobody sucks here everybody sucks here i
don't know
it's just not fun come on stop posting
real stuff man
start posting funny stuff
i don't know one
i don't know the the the terms of
service on not safe for work text
so am i the a-hole for kicking my friend
out of my party after she had blank
blank blank in the bathroom maybe we'll
skip that one down here but
am i the [ __ ] for telling the
professor that i am in fact a customer
and have the right to expect good
service okay here
i don't know
but what i am going to say is
i am comma in fact comma a customer and
do have the right to expect
and i quote good service that
is just the way that that's phrased as
like a shower thought comeback
it has primed me in the direction of
being like
you might be okay but let's see
i-20 f have one professor in particular
who pretty much no one likes students
can't stand him he has terrible student
reviews
on rate my professor and other platforms
but i had to take his class if i want to
graduate with honors in my chosen degree
program okay
so far so so sane
he's a very archaic professor his
teaching methods are highly outdated one
thing he does is curve grades which is
when you artificially lower the grades
of people who earned a's or b's to be
season d's just to make it so only a few
students are allowed to succeed even if
others
learn earned a higher grade okay so
here's my thought
on curving
you cannot
curve down
you can only curve up
curving down is like a war crime
if somebody got a 95 on your exam
because you didn't make it hard enough
and then that makes you upset you don't
get to be like well somebody got 100 so
i'm gonna take you know you down to like
an 80 instead okay
curving down
is
is nasty
i feel like it's one of those things and
admittedly like i don't work in stats
but like
what if you just had a a a cohort of
classmates who are smarter than the year
that came before
like you know the law of large numbers
if you had a class of a hundred thousand
people every year
the the
dissimilarities should even out but if
you got a class of like 50 people you
could easily have like you know
five idiots or six idiots in the class
one year and the next year you know half
of those idiots get replaced with
geniuses and all of a sudden like you
know why why are you normalizing
everybody into that situation
so
within a class you're like okay i got a
56 because i was like the 11th
worst in my class or something like that
but you're 56 you might have gotten an
80 on the exam whereas last year
somebody got a 56 got a a 20 on the exam
and got cranked up anyway so this is
look i just don't i don't i don't
respect
the the curve down a curve up is
generous if they do it i think that's
nice
curve down is the way i look at the
curving down is like
your
your professor
[ __ ] up if they made it too easy
you don't get to punish other people by
like possibly you know lowering them
under the requirements for their
scholarship or something like that just
because of the fact that you made it too
easy and you're upset anyway that's just
my thought on that okay
curving down should only be allowed at
the urinal but dumb bump
anyway that's that's good that's good i
like that
it's a good joke i was gonna make a joke
which is
i don't even have enough to curve but
now i just now i just feel bad
time to drink some blue juice
cheers
anyway
um yeah just so he can brag and say my
class is so hard
our college's administration
is very critical of the practice of
curving and ask professors not to do so
it's considered even more ridiculous
when the class is in a stem class the
administration allows students to file a
request with a grading board if they've
been graded on fairly by professors to
resolve the issues in grading
my professor graded me completely
unfairly on a recent assignment first he
gave everyone in the class the answer to
a particular question on the assignment
which he designed incorrectly
so he was just giving them points due to
his mistake i wasn't in class because i
had a cough
and even though it wasn't corona the
administration makes us quarantine if we
show symptoms he never told me the about
the answer he gave to everyone
okay
that happens like
like i know how that sounds but yeah
sometimes you're you're sick on a day
where nothing gets taught and sometimes
you're sick on a day where they
introduce like the most important
mechanic of all time
so on the assignment i i told you in
third grade i missed like three days of
class and as a result even to this day i
have no knowledge of grammar
i know what a subject is in a sentence i
don't know what a predicate is i'm going
to assume it's everything but the
subject
i don't know what an adverb is i don't
know what uh
i only did in the last decade i've only
found out what pronouns were
you know it's been a long road for me to
approach some level of of
competency with respect to grammar
you taught english i know
but like it's you i was teaching english
as a second language in you know second
in south korea
you're not going like
uh you know this is an adverb you're
going like the apple is red
for like all day every day
you know hello jenny how are you i'm
fine thank you and you hello sally how
are you i'm fine thank you and you hello
sarah how are you i'm fine thank you and
it's just that
hours and hours every day
if one of the kids was like what the
heck is a is a predicate i would be like
how about we just focus on learning what
the yellow fruit is and then we'll talk
about predicates when we when we get
there
anyway
so on this assignment i was unfairly
docked several points because he didn't
tell me the answer he gave away
from the whole class because i was
forced to miss class due to quarantine
i'm getting mired in the weeds i'll
admit that's your problem
that that i was on your side up to this
point for sure that is not the
professor's problem it's not his
responsibility to make sure that if you
miss the class that you're caught up
he's got other things to do
everything else i get okay
the administration would consider this
an unequal playing field oh my god shut
the [ __ ] up
shut up
the administration would consider this
an unequal playing field all students
are supposed to have an equal chance of
scoring well in the assignments
unfortunately none of my classmates will
talk to me and give me their notes
because i
speak to them in a patronizing fashion
missing these points lowered my grade to
the borderline between a and b and then
the professor so it's a wave just a
thought here
what about the other questions you got
wrong
so you were on the borderline presumably
you got more than one question wrong the
question that you couldn't possibly have
gotten right because you missed the day
where he gave you the answer uh all the
other ones though hey hey man those ones
what are you supposed to do you just
sometimes you get them right sometimes
you get them wrong but i deserve to get
that one that i got wrong right
missing those points lowered my
borderline so my grade was artificially
lowered to a b so that he can brag about
how only x people got a's on the recent
assignment the whole situation was
unfair from start to finish i never even
had a fair chance to do well
i argued heatedly with him about it and
he said
i argued heatedly with him about it and
then he had the audacity audacity to
nastily say to me youth these days you
all think the customer is always right
but you aren't customers and don't have
the right to a certain level of service
to which i corrected him actually i am
by definition a customer i don't pay 80
000 a year to be cheated out of the
grade i rightfully earned by
first 80k like
let's be realistic you're not paying 80k
maybe your parents are paying 80k more
realistically
fannie mae is paying 80k a year you're
probably gonna end up paying like 130
140k a year by the time it's over okay
so like as long as we're being highly
specific let's just make sure everything
is absolutely on the table here
um
i've already decided i'm never asking
this guy for a recommendation for
anything so i have nothing to lose at
this point i'm escalating to the grading
board to have them review what happens
so i can salvage my grade am i the
[ __ ]
um
it was not in the notes
he verbally gave a freebie to the class
and he has expected per university rules
to tell quarantine students if they miss
something crucial and it's not in the
notes there's no situation in which i
could have known about the freebie
like
i'm just look okay
i feel bad because like
i do think she's the [ __ ]
and i think the professor is the [ __ ]
too but i'm like
you kind of just
like
you gotta be okay like
obviously here's the thing is it
possible that this b screws up the whole
trajectory for her life
no
but it's possible that she does believe
that i believe if there were huge
consequences for the the b she would
have put them in the post because she
put a lot of details in here that made
her case look as
flattering to her as possible like for
example i had a cough it wasn't corona
but i would have gone to class with my
cough and gotten everybody else sick
except the university [ __ ] wouldn't
allow me as a result i missed the
professor giving out an answer and there
was no way conceivably for me to
possibly get to the point where i could
have gotten it no one will tell me that
because they've all kind of academically
blacklisted me um because i talked to
them like they're stupid um
long story short like i don't i mean can
i can i be honest with you i actually
think
i i kind of don't think she has a leg to
stand on and i understand that might
make me
that might make me the [ __ ]
on top of the situation
i feel like if you miss the class
and then you get something wrong on the
exam
because you missed the class
it's your responsibility
that's that's all like i i don't really
have anything else to say about it
like like
i can understand her frustration you
know you miss a big day
and then you you're you know you feel
punitively punished as a result
however
at the same time it's like
if you get sick you miss a class you
talk to your classmates you go like hey
what did i miss you know you take their
notes and copy them down yourself
etc etc the curve down is stupid that's
like
100 i i'm not on the teacher's side when
it comes to that i just don't know like
what the professor is supposed to do
they're like supposed to individually
email all of the students that are sick
you know for one reason or another and
be like hey by the way
just so you know 35 minutes into my 55
minute lecture i said that the answer to
question 16a was like
you know this
i just i mean i don't i don't
that's his job well you know
no
i i don't know maybe maybe it's a boomer
take i don't think your job as a
professor is to
you know in in an undergraduate lecture
email everybody who is not there on a
given day and make sure they're all on
the same page you can all be on the same
page by either attending class or if
you're not able to attend class then you
get the notes from your classmates you
know like you distribute the load out
there
i don't see it as his job at all to make
sure all the students are on the same
page i see that as the student's
responsibility
youth these days
you're so convinced that the customer's
always right
i can't even read chat it's going off so
much
you're ignoring a lot of context
i don't know what context am i ignoring
the curving down i'll admit
that at worst it's everybody sucks here
because the professor is definitely an
[ __ ]
i also think that op
is like really whiny
the context is we're in a pandemic
obviously but that you know that doesn't
mean that the professor's job
is to make sure that everybody who is
quarantined also gets all the notes why
can't the students get the notes from
the people that were in the class
okay just email your classmate and be
like hey did i miss anything in the
lecture today at which point your
classmate goes yeah he gave out the
answer to question 16 that's going to be
on the exam
we have a different
i mean admittedly i didn't go to college
during quarantine
we have a different
mindset or i have a different mindset
that chad that's all i'm saying i feel
like the professor's job
is
research
and then secondarily
it's to present the same 35 lecture
slides
uh
over and over again to incoming class of
freshmen and then distribute the marking
to all the tas
that's basically it i don't i don't
think they have a i at least when i when
i went to school and admittedly i didn't
go to school during covid
even though when i went to night school
and stuff like that when students missed
the class it was always their
responsibility
to make up the difference
i don't i don't think she's a bad
student i think she's just like
i think she's just
a little high strung
read the edit yeah okay like look you
read the edit at per university rules
what does she know
okay i'm just saying
i'm bringing a lot of my own bias into
this but i'm like i don't think that she
necessarily knows that that and
admittedly i'm going against what's
written on the page but there's a part
of me that's like
you know
nobody reads those
i'm just like look
i think that the professor should not be
curving down i i i accept her premise
that
the professor is a bad professor is
hated etc etc i've had it before many
times
i just i take issue
with her
deflecting responsibility at every turn
that i guess that's where it comes down
to me like the whole thing is just
steeped in i never had a chance hey
we're suppo the university says
everybody's supposed to be on an even
playing field and yet i was uniquely
discriminated against because i had a
cough that wasn't covid and there was no
he gave away an answer
during the lecture and as a i couldn't
be at the lecture there was no way for
me to there were no means for me to
actually get that answer for myself like
it's it's
look
if she's right in principle then then
she's right in practice i guess as well
but there is like
i i think it's everybody sucks here
but she doesn't suck for the way that
she talked to the professor i just think
she sucks for
being like a little bit too
just just a little bit too
obsessed with going from b to a that's
it
now her being annoying doesn't actually
make her like an [ __ ]
but it it does kind of
make me less likely to be a hundred
percent on her side
i don't know look i've had bad
professors as well all right but i also
i i find myself um
you know putting myself in in the
professor's shoes right just just not to
give him too much sympathy but i'm like
you know
50th time teaching the class
you know he's got a lot on his plate
not that the students don't as well
and then like he's you know this one
person is soaking up
like more attention than the rest of the
class combined and i can see to some
extent why he might be like man i wish
this girl would shut the hell up
i can understand i'm building my own
head cannon okay you're not wrong i'm
building my own head cannon
but i'm just saying i could i could
totally see because i've had night
classes as well where i was like you
know
the professor occasionally like gets
into it with a couple of students and at
the end of the year you know there's 40
kids in the class you know when one of
them puts up their hand and they start
asking some inane question that's never
come up in reality you and a couple of
the other people in the class just look
at each other and go like
here we go again
technically um i said that uh that this
data type was a long long on the quiz
and i got it
right but then it turns out that the
right answer was long but would i still
have been right like is it something
where like all
longs
are also long longs or is it something
more like all long longs are longs and
i'm just asking just in case like at
some point
in the future like maybe when i work at
microsoft like during my interview i
might have a question
like this and i'm totally going to
remember this i'm going to lock it away
in my memory palace um so i just want to
know like when i get asked at the
interview is a long long along or is
like a long long just a different kind
of uh is it a different data type
together or is it a double or is it and
you're like man we only got an hour here
and you know we're good we're gonna end
up going late just because you like the
sound of your own voice
oh look at this cutie baby
hello
hey
hey
hey baby
where's your nose
oh
kobe
hey
holy crap she did it
your eyes
eyes
eyes
a little ambitious i think guys i was
going i was teaching her eyes today eyes
eyes where's your
ear
only only i can pick my nose on stream
honey
your glasses i had to i had to just put
my picture up for like 20 minutes to
just burn out all the new glasses new
glasses new glasses new glasses new
glasses
though they'll get used to it
they don't like it it's not they don't
like it it's just that have you ever
seen like the way that they the internet
reacts to like a uh
a youtube layout change or a twitter
layout change or like a font change on
reddit like it takes
it takes 10 years for people to be like
ah actually it just looks normal now
sheesh
okay
you're like
dada
bye
there he goes
oh and now oh tomo would like to come
out too
ah it's all right in like five seconds
they'll start beating the door down to
get back in
no i'm not worried about um
i mean can i be honest i kind of i love
being in the why are you booing me i'm
right situation
i'm not courting the controversy of
calling this lady a butthole
just to court the controversy i'm just
being
i'm just giving you my honest opinion
which is why i kind of like uh
i i find it enjoyable
otherwise you could just make up like
the the consensus opinion you know
how dare that jerk professor who
probably you know is his wife's probably
cheating on him how dare he be so rude
to this she had no chance to get the
answer right you know what i mean
but that's not the way that i wanna
it's not the way that i wanna uh
approach this i mean like i'm here's the
thing i'm like i'm very laissez-faire as
a student okay i worked hard at least at
the stuff that i cared about but
you know whenever somebody was like my
entire self-worth is wrapped up in never
getting a b ever and then they soak up
you know
50 people's time with their own petty
squabble with the professor i'm like
[ __ ] both of you honestly like just
grow up
some of us are just trying to get out of
the lecture
get a head start on the project and
invest our time in a way that it's like
most uh appropriate and efficient rather
than like have to watch these two like
supposed adults you know put their egos
on the line for something that's
irrelevant for everybody else
anyway
we're just going to scroll past the one
that might be tos how about this one
uh am i the [ __ ] for telling my wife
she doesn't look good in her favorite
dress
seems like the answer is yes
i male 42 and my wife f39 were trying on
some clothes the other day to go out we
both gained some weight since the
pandemic since we stopped going to the
gym but are starting up again my wife
tried on her old favorite dress which is
tight and since she gained weight it
just doesn't look as good i didn't say
anything
i didn't say anything at first okay but
then when she asked i told her honestly
i don't think it looks as good as it
used to i like your black one more
because it's slimming she got mad at me
and started yelling i told her sorry if
your feelings are hurt are you stupid
like are you just a dumb idiot what's
wrong with you
why would you even post this
you're dumb
like
it's
you're 42 years old man come on
like
it's it is it's a literal sitcom moment
okay
i don't know
i don't even want to look at the
comments because i've seen everybody
loves raymond i know how the situation
plays out but like
i just don't understand
yeah you're the [ __ ]
i mean especially if you're you're
insecure you're going to the gym you
both you know you put on weight during
the pandemic none of that makes you the
[ __ ] but when she's like do i look
good in the dress
i mean
look
maybe this is naive but i'm like
she's your wife for one
she if your husband she probably looks
good in the dress in your eyes to begin
with i don't even think you need to lie
you know i think you just
even if you're like oh you know she's
gained weight
you just go like yeah you still look
great
i i
maybe the black dress looks better but
like i i just don't understand like you
actually
here's the thing i bet he thinks she
still looks good
in the red dress
but he's just
he's too smart to realize he's dumb i
guess is what i'm trying to say he
probably thought you know would be nice
is i'll just i'll tell her that the
black dress looks better because it's
slimming and then she'll be really happy
because
you know she'll be like oh i like the
black dress too that's not very smart
you can't be honest you can be honest
without being an ass yes correct
you're the [ __ ] you knew you were
mean stop playing dumb dude this
gentle you're the [ __ ]
sure okay you're the [ __ ] you're the
[ __ ]
honestly as a large female myself i
don't think you're the a-hole she should
have calmly taken your opinion as you
had clarified it was your honest opinion
and she should have been happy you
didn't just say what she wanted to hear
yeah okay
um
i always
as long as it's someone's honest opinion
you can't get mad that's i think how
human beings work
she should have just rationally
dissected your opinion and said well as
long as you're being honest no worries
going against the grain here and saying
i am not and saying not an [ __ ] i get
so tired of this trope that men have to
lie to us if we ask them how we look in
something if a person doesn't want to
know the answer to a question don't ask
the question
bro come on
husband bot 9000 wifebot 9000 logging on
your thermodynamic needs have been
oversupplied recently yes thank you they
just
you're just people i don't know like
yeah you like i mean just be realistic
like you lie
to people like a hundred times a day
99 of those lies are lies that you make
from a noble position
of being a good person and being like
you know hey what you just said was
really funny when in your head you're
like it was okay you know you just
you know i don't i don't think it is a
little high i think that's a pretty
realistic number i don't think your lies
are like i was at the grocery store but
actually you were at like the number
five orange you know i i think it's just
uh
you know it's it's the it's the way of
human communication is that you know you
you
lie
to flatter people you you misrepresent
things to make the conversation flow
more freely like absolutely
what you just said was really funny see
and then i could be like you're lying
but in my head i'm like
i would even it's it's cypher in the
matrix right
even though i know this steak isn't real
even though i know the matrix is just
telling me that it's delicious
ignorance is bliss
when people are writing plus two
and lol la mao this is the funniest
thing i've ever heard i know that
when they're at their computer they're
actually just like
lol
plus two
plus two lol right i know they're not
sitting at the computer going
most of the time but uh
i choose to believe when i see the lulls
i imagine a stadium of of laughter in
front of me
and what can i say
joey pantaliano was right
ignorance is bliss
anyway here's what i will say okay
i think it depends on
the couple
yeah i think you know each other right
like
kate is honest with me a lot
sometimes she'll be like those pants
don't really look like they fit anymore
and i'm like not offended
that's cause
nobody can damage me with their words as
much as i can damage myself with my
internal monologue so like i do
appreciate that honesty i'm like you
know what i'm gonna go up a size next
time
but for most people you you kind of feel
it out right
especially like if somebody comes up to
you and goes like hey are you like hey
do you like this new purse that i bought
you don't go like
i don't really understand it
you know you just go wow it looks super
cool
i don't know
the guy in the matrix saying that about
the stake was a villain
you and i get a different read from the
matrix
my reading of the matrix is that
capitalism is the only villain all the
individuals were merely products of the
machine
through which they operated
i can understand if you only got a base
level reading of the matrix ooh bald guy
bad bald guy bad he unplugged uh
whatever their names are i don't even
remember he unplugged glitch he
unplugged glitch balled the guy bad i'm
like nah man society bad
society bad
just call me grimes
am i the [ __ ] for making my teenage
daughters
bedtime hours sweet my work schedule am
i the [ __ ] for making my teenage
daughters bedtime hours sweet to my work
schedule am i am am i the [ __ ] for
making my teenage daughters bedtime
hours suit my work schedule
this depends
would it suit your work schedule if she
slept from 11 p.m until 8 am
or does it only suit your work schedule
if she sleeps from like 11 a.m until 7
pm because that's uh
i think that'll change things slightly
oh my god dude this is too long
this is too damn long
this is too
damn
long dude let's read it my 17 year okay
hold on up let's do the update later
this is not rashomon okay
my 17 year old teenager and i have
frequent arguments about bedtime when it
is not a school night she will stay up
until 3 a.m in the morning playing video
games on a school night until midnight
that
is actually
when
as as a child well as a late teenager at
17
that was about my schedule i go to bed
around midnight
on a on a weekday maybe 2am on the
weekends this seems fine
well i understand it's an important way
for her to connect to her friends we
also live in a very small place her
playing video games and chatting keeps
me up at night when i have to wake up at
6 a.m for work each morning that's also
fair if you're doing like voip or
something like that that's that would
that would annoy me as well fair enough
we have a one bedroom basement suite and
my bedroom is in the living room there
is only a pocket door between where i
need to sleep and where she's in the
living or the bedroom playing online
with her friends i'm afraid we will
disturb the other tenants that live next
door the landlord upstairs which
increases my anxiety as well
tonight i got up rather than lying in
bed and sat in her bedroom just so she
can tell how long she is actually
keeping me awake she stayed playing her
games for another hour from two to three
a.m and just told me to take sleeping
pills if i can't handle it okay that's a
dick move but she is also 17.
so
not a surprise
straight up okay
um
let's let's continue there's a lot to
work with here
she does nearly no chores and she by the
way okay like this is
parent-splaining okay
when you are complaining about the
behavior of your child
i'm not saying you have complete
one-to-one control over what your child
does
but the complaints you have about your
child reflect on you
as well as the child so when you're like
oh my [ __ ] daughter doesn't do any
chores i'm like well
you know
how did that happen like did if you
wanted her to do chores did you start
putting that groundwork in when she was
like six years old to get her like give
her like responsibility bit by bit or
did you just treat her like a roommate
and you're like now she's 17 she's not
doing any chores and that's upsetting
anyway
she does nearly no chores has few
responsibilities she doesn't leave her
room on the weekends until noon
she attends school regularly earns
average grades does all her homework but
no additional studying or prep okay so
she's a person uh in my daughter's
opinion i'm an a-hole and a
b-r-t-c-h she has trouble making friends
at school i should be supporting her
spending time with her friends when they
are available they mostly graduated in
the last two years and they work until
midnight she feels like my bedtimes of
12 a.m on weekends or holidays is
unreasonable
this is am i the
am i the dick for saying this doesn't
seem that bad
like can't you just find a resolution
where like at midnight she turns off
voip or something like that like you can
still play the games
as i don't i i feel like she shouldn't
as long as her 17 year old
goes to school
and doesn't you know like
drop out
then i feel like she should be her
bedtime shouldn't matter she seems
normal
as long as you know she's she's not
disturbing you the problem is not really
her bedtime it's that she's just like
you know
she's just being loud on the voip which
i understand
to answer a few anyway to answer a few
more questions my daughter did do chores
for much of her life she had a really
rough time of it last year as she came
out as trans and even stopped schooling
for a few months that she felt
uncomfortable being there but we worked
through that this is when chores and
such went by the wayside as my bottom
line was school attendance and all work
at school being completed she has
learning challenges as well so she may
never attain more than average grades
but she should be achieving more with
dedicated study
she may never get more than average
grades but she could be doing better
than average grades
okay i mean i i understand like all of
the context okay she does use headphones
when chatting with her friends so it's
not their discussion but her excited
chatter when she's playing this all
makes perfect sense
can she not just like be quiet after
midnight
that's what just
like why she can even be on the voip but
she just can't say anything like or she
maybe she could like whisper or
something like that at least
excited chatter i mean i'm just like i
mean we went through the same thing like
my uh
me and my parents went through the same
thing obviously the context was not the
same but like
with summer vacations i would stay up
until like 2 a.m playing
halo 2 uh
on on xbox live
and then like
my parents
would be like
hey can you not be so loud and i would
be like okay sorry
and then we we just made it work okay
that would i i
we didn't live in a one-bedroom house to
be fair but you know it's i feel like if
you can't sleep because of
clickety-clack on the controller you can
adjust to that
that's something that just event for
most people i think it like falls into
the the din of ambien noise
people
inconsistently talking shouting laughing
you can't really like turn off your
brain and not interpret what they're
saying like that stuff i understand
completely but
um also i'm not poor i'm a single mom i
actually have a graduate degree and earn
a good salary but i'm not willing to
spend more on my on rent as we live in a
high cost of living city oh sure okay
like that's i understand
that's all fine
i don't think op is the [ __ ] in the
slightest here
i think it's very reasonable to be
annoyed by your daughter's voice
communication
after midnight um
let's read the update up here
it was a good wake-up call to me i
shared your responses with my daughter
i'm sure that was nice hey honey i
posted on reddit and thousands of people
have weighed in on the situation with a
limited amount of context to help us
come up with a resolution
um
she knows that as long as she respects
quiet time rules then wi-fi won't be
unplugged if she doesn't then it is she
also agreed there's no reason for her to
complete there's no reason for her not
to complete her chores i'm assuming oh
that's a great update man there's
nothing wrong with it so the whole
like i'm not trying to be upset okay but
the whole thing was basically like
i told her she can go to bed whatever
she wants as long as she's quiet and she
said okay the end like
okay i didn't i didn't need to know this
much about
your family up to this point i just
anyway
hey honey we took our quarrel to reddit
and decided that the best
well we've decided that uh
you and i are going to get a divorce and
uh also
you're malevolent plus santa was in
turkish anyway he was probably lysean
but it seems like the jury's still out
to some extent
am i the [ __ ] for asking my wife to
get her name
my name tattooed on her
no
my wife and i have been together since
we were 16 married for five years we
have one son she dared me to get her
name tattooed on myself i did it okay
not the [ __ ]
i recently told her she should get my
name tattooed on her so i don't feel
like such an idiot she said she's
against tattoos and that i'm abusing her
by expecting her to ink herself up
so she doesn't want to whatever but i
guess she told someone who then told our
entire family that i was pressuring her
to do things she wasn't comfortable with
and her stepdad wanted to have a chat
with me
i dislike her stepdad that guy is the
worst but the guy literally took it upon
himself to stand up at dinner and
express his concern started subtly
hinting at me trying to control his
pride and joy i told him to go to hell
and now i'm the bad guy what the hell is
some people are
too
stupid to be uh
alive
i want to be clear i'm not saying that
they should die
i'm more just like surprised
that they made it far enough to
for their
juvenile brain
to get into this situation as an adult
i guess is what i'm trying to say
um
like
okay we've been together since we were
16 married for five years we have one
son great story so far
she dared me to get her name tattooed on
myself i did it you're stupid
i recently told her she should get my
name tattooed on her so i don't feel
like such an idiot just throwing it out
there if you didn't want to feel like
such an idiot
you shouldn't have gotten a tattoo in
the first place until you had some kind
of like
mutually assured destruction set up in
advance or like maybe
you could
go into the tattoo parlor at the same
time and get it done or something like
that like this seems like a situation
where you're
like look she's the joker based on this
i don't know what she's doing
but
he doesn't get
he's too stupid to be mad
i know how it sounds like it sounds like
i'm being a [ __ ]
but like if kate was like get your name
tattooed on me and then i was like i
came home with like kate tattooed on my
butt cheek or something
and i was like okay your turn and she
was like are you crazy no i would be
like all right i'll take the l on that
one you got me
i really should not have done that i
don't know what came over me
fair enough well played
to the victor go the spoils
but you know what i would do
after that i would go back to the tattoo
parlor i would just get them to change
it to
skate four
and then people would be like they
wouldn't ask any questions
they would be like that's a great tattoo
but if your wife's name is like
esmerelda or something then you got some
problems i don't know how they're gonna
change that maybe they could just be a
big fan of like the hunchback of notre
dame or something like that but
anyway um
i just like i i
honestly it sounds like
you're dumb and your wife is uh insane
she's like a a batman villain and you
know like are are you okay op i guess is
what i'm asked because it kind of seems
like this is one of those preambles
where like later you know you go over
for thanksgiving and they're like we
have this game we always play and then
the game is like hide and seek but then
it ends up with them having like weapons
and you're like crawling through
like the walls of their mansion and
stuff like that trying to escape like
that this feels like it is a situation
where you thought your wife was your
ally but actually she has a closer bond
with her family uh that she grew up with
than anybody else um because they're all
in this weird cult and then you're just
kind of like the newest like at some
point you're gonna go over for
thanksgiving and you're gonna be like
who's that and she'll be like oh that
was my ex-boyfriend and he's gonna have
like a mustache or something like that
and then later you're gonna be in the
basement
and you're going to see a skeleton with
a mustache and you're going to be like
oh [ __ ]
it's going to be something like like i'm
just concerned
a great big bushy beard
i'm just concerned about you
in this situation
but why would you get
uh
oh is it is there not like a hippocratic
oath for
um
tattoo artists
there's no they don't have to like make
sure you're of sound mind i know that
like they're supposed to make sure
you're like sober or something but
i don't know how much that actually
happens in practice because i never
gotten a tattoo
like there's a good shops will make sure
you're sober this is an honest question
though like if i went into a reputable
tattoo shop
and i i
said i want you to tattoo like a
realistic phallus on my cheek
and then they were like what do you do
for work and i would be like i'm the
mayor
a reputable tattoo parlor would still be
like
all right what did the whatever the
customer wants the customer gets
i guess they don't have a leg to stand
on to say no but i'm like
you know what they should do all tattoo
parlors should have like ombudsmen
like like two people have to turn a key
at the same time to open up the vault
that holds the tattoo gun
and before you get tattooed you have to
go
here's the tattoo i want here's why i
want it and then two
a jury of your peers have to be like
that seems acceptable
and i i think that would eliminate it
would probably cause some false positive
situations
don't get me wrong where like you really
want a tattoo but it's very hard to get
people to agree to it
it is your
it's your right as an adult to have that
kind of freedom i suppose but i also
feel like it would help
i'm not blaming the tattoo artist okay
i'm just surprised that nobody
more juvenile than me has ever been like
you know we need to stop these tattoo
artists from tattooing the dumb [ __ ]
that we came up with on our bodies with
our consent
i would have thought that at some point
somebody would have gotten something
idiotic tattooed on them and then been
like i'm gonna spend the rest of my life
lobbying the tattoo industry so that
this never happens again
what's next a license to
get tattooed by my own toaster
all right let me just
not the [ __ ] but i'm also petty
enough that i would get something
tattooed over her name so maybe you
shouldn't listen to me
i mean like you should at this point
like she's the joker
you should get the tattoo messed up
absolutely
this
i mean i'd i think you'd be silly if you
didn't at this point
comment deleted by user
okay well thanks for your help
everybody sucks here never get a tattoo
of a name unless it's your child okay
yeah i mean
i see your point but after she refused
the tattoo i would have suggested a
cover up of your tattoo with her name
after she requested name tattoos are a
horrible everybody knows nobody is what
what about the part
where she is like you're trying to
control what i'm doing with my body and
then she got her stepdad involved like
this is nasty man like it's not about
everybody you know what to be like a
genius to realize you shouldn't get
someone's name tattooed on you
especially not without like uh
a tit for tat kind of solution there
i'm just saying
anyway
i want to read more comments but i also
have to go to the bathroom so i think
that's going to do it for react court
today we got some good stuff i i love a
uh i love a react court where i was in
the minority for for one of the uh
episodes as well that's then later this
week i go to youtube and i'm like why
does that have a 92 like dislike ratio
instead of 98.7 and i'm like oh that's
the one where i called that 19 year old
college student a [ __ ] my mistake sorry
sorry anyway um react court
two



and plans i had with my stepdaughter to
spend time with my my bio daughter
possibly not
seems like probably not but they always
write the title like yeah obviously
hi all i've been part of my 12 year old
step daughter abby's life for five years
and been married to her mother for the
last two she's a lovely kid we're very
close she sadly doesn't have any contact
with her bio dad but i've tried my best
to be there and be supportive for her
abby and i always do something on
fridays when she's finished school
clothes shopping or go for ice cream
watch a movie if it's warm to go to the
park and play football
[ __ ] dick
[ __ ]
bill gates 1v1 me thank you for the
gifted subscriptions thank you
i appreciate it i can't pass that
challenge uh along i don't know how to
reach his people but i i'm rude and i
don't know if i'm rooting for you i'm
rooting for you right now but i don't
know we'll have you seen him he can jump
over a chair
however i also have a bio daughter
rachel
she is 23 and has always lived with my
ex how unfortunately she got herself
sent to prison i won't go into detail
but it wasn't serious she was only in
there for six months
it's just a hidden run the cops said
it's like not a big deal
the person she hit wasn't even like a
real person sort of they weren't even
supposed to be around in the area
we were never very close but we began
writing to each other when she was in
there and i visited her a few times i'm
going to employ her at my business
rachel was released in the morning she
headed straight to my ex's place but
called me saying she'd like to see me in
the evening i didn't want to cancel
plans with abby but it's important to be
there for rachel i texted abby my
apologies rachel and i went for coffee
and then did a bit of shopping i got her
a couple of new dresses and a new
handbag a handbag
i thought it was only fair to get her
something nice after she was worn prison
gear for six months it was a good day
and next week we're gonna start her
application to my company when i got
home my wife was in a complete rage she
said i let abby down and she was glad to
know what my priorities are abby was
crying in her room and told me to go
away when i knocked on the door i'm
truly sorry for making abby so upset but
what else could i have done rachel's my
child too and she's just endured six
months of hell but i had to be there for
her as a father and help her rebuild her
life especially as i haven't been in the
past am i the [ __ ] not the [ __ ]
in principle
could you have just hung out with your
stepdaughter and then moved your
uh
daddy-daughter date with your daughter
to the next day or something like that
yeah like in principle
you probably could have done that
however i would say that there's like a
few exceptions in life where like
you know you kind of one social
gathering like takes precedent over
another one one would be when your
daughter gets out of prison i think that
you could be like hey abby maybe we
could like do something a little later
my daughter just got out of prison
like for six months she was incarcerated
so we're just gonna like she really
needs to spend some time with like her
father
right now
um
just for a night and we can just go get
ice cream tomorrow or something like
that
don't care didn't ask plus she's a felon
um yeah so like my interpretation is i
think very similar to chats on this one
which is
the stepdaughter can be mad she's 12.
so you get mad at everything man
um the mom
has an obligation to be the electrical
resistor on that circuit and look at
this situation
not emotionlessly but but from a a
bird's eye view of the situation and be
like is it okay that my daughter's upset
yes
does that mean that my husband was out
of line
spending
you know a couple hours with his
daughter who just got released from
prison no so you just take the heat
basically and then the next day they
wake up and they're probably fine or
like you know a couple days or something
like that um
you sometimes you just you know you just
gotta
basically eat someone else's emotions
and soak them all up
because you know you'd be people get
frustrated with one another for unfair
things so
overall
um
i mean it's not the [ __ ] there
doesn't have to be an [ __ ] if there
is an
[ __ ] then
i think i think his wife was kind of an
[ __ ] here but
anyway
um
i i do want to read the you're the
[ __ ] she got out of prison man
she
that's a big deal
bro just let her watch netflix tonight
take my daughter or her stepdaughter out
for ice cream instead
it's like she was in prison
orange jumpsuit
you got a one friend and it's a mouse
you keep it in like a little jar then
there's like an [ __ ] prison guard who
kills your mouse and you go
you know what i'm talking about brooks
was here
michael clark
duncan know what i'm talking about
that's two different movies but
one of them's the green mile the other
one's the shawshank redemption
you know she was just in prison for six
months you know the warden is cooking
the books so he can lie in his own
pockets while making the inmates uh live
in decrepit conditions
there's a huge man named john coffey
there who might have some connection to
the other side you know what i mean you
might be able to talk to dead people or
something like that i can't remember i
haven't seen it in about you know 20
years
you know rita you got posters of rita
hayworth you're using a little spoon to
dig out the the the cement every night
you're crawling through a mile of [ __ ]
anyway
i am waiting for
i'm waiting for info what was she in
prison for
um
not the [ __ ] this is a one-off yeah
okay we don't even need to read this
this is like that's just you're too
smart
not the [ __ ] people in the comments
are acting like she's six six instead of
twelve
she's all sixes and sevens basil not the
[ __ ] people don't get released from
prison every day it was a one-off thing
yeah man
not the [ __ ]
about oh here we go
this guy is sam elliott at the bar
a boss once told me you can get away
with anything if you do it right you're
not an [ __ ] for what you did but
you're an [ __ ] for how you did it you
treated a 12 year old like an adult who
understands complex relationships in
history okay sure yeah
you owe your wife and the girl a sincere
apology not for what you did but how you
handled it okay you owe the girl an
apology
you do not own your your owe your fully
grown wife
an apology what you owe her is an
explanation that's like hey i understand
that abby's upset but my daughter got
released from [ __ ] jail
maybe you could cut me some slack
[Laughter]
she got released from prison this wasn't
like she was like let's hang out tonight
you know i'm free
she was like let's hang out tonight i'm
free
holy [ __ ] not the [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah
not the [ __ ]
not the [ __ ]
no [ __ ] but you did the screw-up
i believe that opie was not the one who
was incarcerated
info did you know she was being released
that day was she released earlier or
later than
schedule
exactly right op says they wrote letters
and he visited daughter would have known
her release date she probably knew the
day she went to prison since it was a
six month sentence even if the release
date was moved up they tell you he could
have moved the day with stepdaughter or
told daughter i have planned see you
tomorrow
i thought this was like the end of the
comment like
like honest this is not like i don't
disagree but it's just like sometimes
people like
they make mistakes you know
like your whole
if your whole
purpose in life was just to be a meat
computer that handles this one
interaction as best as possible you
could dedicate 16 hours a day to to
making sure that nobody got offended by
this you have no problem but sometimes
people you know sometimes you're like
i'll take the garbage down and then like
12 hours later the garbage is still
there and you know
you don't respond to that with like you
know
why did you lie you responded that with
like oh sorry i got distracted doing a
bunch of other [ __ ]
so i had a bunch of other stuff going on
and i'll do it right now you know like
so yeah maybe he knew the date in
advance but you know he's probably got
other stuff on the go
you were wrong for how you did it it's
not like you got a phone okay sure all
right you're not wrong i just disagree
with the severity
am i the [ __ ] for turning my
husband's office into a library for
myself without telling him and refusing
to give it back
i always think let me let me hydrate
here
i always think about like um
remember i've told this story before in
seventh grade
my teacher told me um
well she told our class that
at the end of the day we would play mind
trap which are like brain teasers that
you pull out of an email hey you're
trapped in a room with three light
switches and three and uh on the other
side of the room is three light bulbs
how with two switch flips how could you
figure out which one did what you know
um
and you you turn one on
you turn another one on for five minutes
then you turn it off you leave the other
one off you see what light is on the two
lights are off then you feel them to
feel out which one is warm oh
right anyway um
she told us we would do
mind trap at the end of the day we ran
out of time my friend got into an
argument with her for like
40 minutes which is the teacher should
have known
we got to stop this but you also it's
not like you get a notification that's
like we're about to start a 40-minute
argument like are you you sure you want
to do this like it just it starts of
like you know one second and then it
just blossoms and you're like it's too
by the time you know you're in it it's
too late it's quicksand right yeah this
is the one where you know he was like a
reddit comment he was like you said we
would play
mind trap
at the end of the day
we're not playing mine trap right now
my parents told me not to respect liars
and you lied your your move your move
you're the [ __ ]
and it's like
you know
it's just if then but there's no like
tolerance built in for like sometimes
[ __ ] happens
you know what like an earthquake at the
school oh we all got to evacuate you
told me we played mine trap you you liar
anyway it's just that i get that
i get a i get a lot of that uh energy
from reddit from time to time
am i the [ __ ] for turning my
husband's office into a library for
myself without telling him and refusing
to give it back i separated from my
husband about three years ago he moved
abroad and i stayed in our marital home
three years is a long time i never
thought we would reconcile so after the
first year i redecorated his office and
turned it into a library for myself we
started talking again in the last seven
months decided to reconcile he moved
back home this week and he was upset i
had taken over his office without
warning since he needs it more than i
need a library
he's especially upset since there were
other rooms in the house that i could
have used but i could have i picked his
office because it had the perfect view
and layout plus i never thought he was
going to come back anyway so it wasn't
like i ever thought he would need it
again he thinks i was trying to erase
him from the house and i could have told
him before i did it since it was still
his house despite us living separately
info i'm already in like info territory
here my husband wants his office back
carlito wants his hand back and wants me
to take another room as a library but i
feel like it would be easier for him to
pick another room and start fresh the
reason he wants the office back is
because it's the perfect location for
him not to be disturbed by noises from
the rest of the house and he had this
room specifically designed to be his
office when he first moved in he's upset
at me because i don't want to move my
library to a different room
you are not going to
make it
ngmi it's not this
come on first off do you live in the
overlook hotel
how many rooms you got there's so many
other
this is not relatable okay
like
there's so many other rooms in our house
but i don't want to move my library like
it's not even a bathroom like just to
have a library
is a luxury to begin with but then to be
like i don't want to move my library
because it has the perfect view like
it's
it's just you're already not relatable
okay
i'm not trying to make this about me
this is reddit or move i streamed from
what was literally supposed to be like
the closet you put your shoes in for
six years something like that guy the
the
thermometer in my office was like
regularly breaking 30 degrees celsius i
was sweating through all my clothes
taking two showers a day and you won't
move your library
it just seems like a little bit
silly to me considering that you know
you're trying to like form a life
together
either way
i back when i lived in the poison
factory
um
there's there's info i'm surprised that
we're not looking at a lot of info
requests here okay
because
if
you both own the house
if you're 50 50 on the house
i don't want to necessarily turn this
into a legal thing
but
he has a right to pick his office
maybe
if it was your office you he wouldn't
have a position to be like you got to
move your office to put my office there
but the library that's like it's got to
go like the library is just a lower
priority
three he maintained the house she
maintained the house for three years on
her own well yeah but like i also want
to see the mortgage statement like
just just because someone doesn't live
in a place for three years if they're
still knocking out the mortgage payment
like that still matters it's not like
they lost ownership of the house as long
as the checks were still clearing
still matters
that's what i'm saying is also not
relatable like
who can afford to like
have a house and not live in it for
three years i don't know some people but
it's a lot
i don't know like i'm i'm like
everybody sucks here i guess is where
i'm coming at this from
i think she should give
the library to her husband
to work as his office because the office
takes precedence over a library i also
think that
he should just
be in a different office
because it seems like a real pain in the
ass to have to like remodel the house to
move the library to another room
can you find something you agree on like
do you guys eat separate dinners or
something like that it's just
it's just a it it's just bizarre
some of these other ones are like you
know am i the [ __ ] for like shooting
my attacker in self-defense and this
one's like i don't want to move my
library it has the perfect view
but my husband doesn't want to have his
office elsewhere because the noises from
the rest of the state will bleed into
his you know perfect hermetically sealed
environment
it's just weird man
i don't i don't know what this i'm just
going with everybody sucks here
expected you to have an office ready for
him for three years are you sure you
want him back
look this
is a very samantha thing to say
everybody sucks here don't remarry your
ex
the [ __ ] what an excellent
reconciliation sarcasm detected and
challenge accepted
he left for three years and then moved
back to immediately start complaining
you were erasing him and is upset with
you for not warning him that you took
over the office exactly why tf are you
getting back together is that like the
number one deal breaker for people is
like
you know they're surprised you like
remodeled
yeah you know what this i want to write
a reply here that says honestly like i
just don't care your problems are not
real
don't get me wrong they're real to you
everybody's problems are real to them
but your problem is not real to anybody
else come on
just setting
bro just set up like a folding desk in
like
you know the utility room or something
like that you can make it work
this is not a this is not a real problem
everybody sucks here
can you not compromise yeah can you like
not just can he not just put a desk in
the library and then well you know what
you know what's going on here she's got
that
thing decked out with like more plants
than the amazon rainforest he's supposed
to have
clients over they got a step between
like palm fronds and ferns and stuff
like that
you know they got one of those
bookshelves that has like the
long-haired plants that are like hanging
over the front of it
people are going to come over and be
like i don't think i want you to handle
my accounts
you know it's happening
it's there's no room for him to put his
three foot diameter globe that opens up
and it has like the cheapest scotch
money can buy inside of it this the way
he seals the deal i i can understand
that when you put it that way now it and
i i completely get it
makes a lot of sense
i do want to know
more about the the home though
like if he owns 50 of the house i still
think he should get a say in the office
like it's a weird situation to buy a
home as a married couple separate but
not divorce i think
and then
be
weird about the rooms when you come back
you gotta come to a compromise it's just
a it's an unusual situation
it's just it's just strange okay
everybody sucks here
i don't care about your problems anymore
let's move on
am i the [ __ ] for using my savings to
pay off my parents mortgage and car
how does this become
i am the [ __ ]
there there must be a a very
a dirty bomb hidden somewhere in the
pros here
oh my wife originally said fine all
right i can tell where this is going
i put away a little bit of money from
every paycheck since i was a kid i used
most of it 77 000 to pay off all my
parents bills that they were committed
to make monthly payments towards which
included their mortgage in my mom's car
just to help him out because my father
got in a pretty serious accident he
might not be able to go back to work at
least not anytime soon
so someone had to do it and i figured it
was my responsibility my wife said i
didn't know them anything and they
hadn't asked for help so it didn't make
sense to help them but my dad would
never accept outside help he'd rather
skate by on social security than do that
it's like if someone who can't swim
jumped into the pool and you see them
start to sink are you gonna wait for
them to ask you before it's too late
leave the metaphors to me buddy okay
you just dropped a fax out here
i'll come up with the analogies all
right
my wife originally said fine i'm not
hungry anyway but i guess she didn't
mean it because now she's saying that i
did the wrong thing basically every
penny i gave my mom was made while my
parents were letting me live with them
over 80 percent of it was made then we
opened the savings retirement account 13
years ago together when we got married
and have been putting money in there
since this is not from that okay i mean
like
it's
you're not the [ __ ] for using your
money
to
help your parents out
and you're
you're kind of an [ __ ]
i don't know it depends on how the
situation like went down right
if you talked about it
and she went yeah that sounds good you
have a great case for that it's your
money they you know you earned before we
had even met each other essentially
you're still contributing to our joint
accounts then no problem
but if if she originally went
fine
and then you did it you got to read
between the lines on that one that's
more of like an everybody sucks here but
i mean this is like a not the [ __ ]
situation i think
he did a nice thing
the reasoning for him being an [ __ ]
is that that money could have gone to
build a life like with his wife together
that's true you know money that you
spend on a could also be used on b
but at the same time like
you know this is not money that they
made together it's his money he helped
his parents out of like a serious jam it
wasn't like he bought them a a maserati
for no reason like
this this is a not the [ __ ] situation
that being said 50 say he's the [ __ ]
42 percent say not the [ __ ] i i can
understand
like why
people would think he's an [ __ ]
everyone's people were like oh his
wife's being greedy well it's not
necessarily greedy to be like you could
have put that 77 000 towards you know
like accelerating our own financial life
as a
as a couple instead you know like
investments
down payment on a house something like
that you know instead of it doesn't mean
that she was just trying to you know
blow it on something
you there's good reasons to to spend it
in a there's good reasons to spend it in
b
we'll see what the comments say
you're the [ __ ] you're married you
don't suddenly drain your savings and
drop 77k without your partner's
agreement hey hey
she said
fine
now
she could have said
that sounds fine
alternatively
[Laughter]
she could have said fine and then walked
into a different room and that changes
the
the dynamic completely
i challenge accepted exactly
and this it's a complicated one
mild you're the [ __ ] if you're
married and have a family of your own
spending your entire savings and your
parents is kind of messed up like i get
wanting to help your family but doing so
the expense of risking your your own
family security is dodgy your parents
are grown-ups they can handle their own
problems you're right they want to help
but if i was your wife i'd be pissed if
they dropped 77k to do it too
after reading other comments and
responses you're the [ __ ] big time
you have a kid and you just mortgaged
her future to keep your parents afloat
even though they have other options your
dad can be too proud all he wants but
what he should have said is use that
money for your daughter's education
instead and the only thing your mother
should have discussed about this is how
they can keep themselves above water
without taking any of your life savings
really everybody sucks here except for
your poor wife ah the plot thickens
kind of
the fact that opia as a kid isn't being
mentioned merely enough
the comment confuses me
doesn't op specifically say his
daughter's education fund was not
touched
he only touched separate money from
before they were married he changed his
story and apparently edited comments
multiple times fortunately he didn't
edit them until he got a negative
reaction so other people saw it already
yeah one point he responded to three or
four things i said at once maybe not
realizing all the ones he's replying to
were me and gave different answers in
different threads justifying it he's
been changing things every time he
responds and each clarification twisted
more and more at best he co-mingled some
money but when he got married brought
what he's calling solely into their
joint
his into their joint finances that his
wife then managed for them overall he
then created new accounts is he going to
prison
this is like a a judgment
a college fund joint retirement fund
some amalgamation of various ones where
all the money seems to be together but
the whole thing was disorganized and
mixed and now he's trying to save face
for messing up or he decided because he
contributed most money he's unilaterally
allowed to change his mind since his
wife is replaceable all of this behind
his dad's back when he didn't even have
a need for sure at the moment however he
did it results in his accountant wife
not asked for by the way realizing he
either lied or improperly communicated
things uh okay this adds so much context
that
that's too much okay they first off they
should not have this much information
about this man's life okay
however
is does it say something about me that i
feel like this guy is in way more hot
water now that i know that his wife's an
accountant
like i feel like that's like if you're
married to a cardiologist and you were
sneaking butterfingers on the side
like to be married to an accountant and
then
be like oh by the way
there's 77 000 in my savings account i
gave it to my parents like i feel like
you're
i that's why i said leave the metaphor
to me
you're the [ __ ] of course you're the
[ __ ] when you marry someone you join
together that's what marriage is big
financial decisions like this need to be
joint decisions
yeah um she said fine
no maybe she said that's a fine
like if you do that that's a fine like
i'm gonna garnish your allowance for the
next
10 years as a result of that maybe he
misinterpreted
anyway i don't know i i'm surprised i
kind of like
i'm i'm more in the middle on reddit but
i don't think i'm fully on chat's side
like it is
i mean marriage is weird right like
kind of when you are married you can
split your finances
you can have your money
our money
your spouse's money but
it's kind of like a
at least i think in north america it's
kind of like a wink and a nudge in the
eyes of the law because i'm pretty sure
all assets accrued since marriage are
de facto considered 50 50 owned by each
spouse so it's kind of like you
know we keep everything separate
in the eyes of the law if it ever came
to that you pretty much just king
solomon it but
i heard me her hurt me
[Laughter]
but i don't know how that applies to 77
000 that was accrued before
you got married but also i feel like
once you start having to have a legal
uh
discussion about this with your spouse
you're heading down a a
a strange road
like once you start to consider the
you know maybe suing your
wife or husband it's
an interesting situation but anyway um
am i the [ __ ] for asking this guy to
i'm seeing to pick up the tab since he
makes so much more than me
user was
cyber bullied for this post no question
about
it please
it's been removed
i was i was so ready man
i was so ready
i'm not i'm not gonna go to redacted
no it's okay i respect the it's the
right to be forgotten okay
redacted
i know we got like half an hour left
here i'm kind of i'm looking for some
i'm looking for some
juicy ones man
i'm looking for some juicy ones
am i the [ __ ] for making my
stepdaughter be less friendly with my
daughter not the [ __ ] i sleep
am i the [ __ ] for changing my baby's
name despite promising my dead husband's
family i'd name the child after him
jackpot
not jackpot not not not jackpot am i the
[ __ ] for getting only one of my twin
sons a phone
i have twin sons
12. let's call them bob and joe for
simplicity's sake
who are in seventh grade back when they
were at the end of fifth grade my wife
and i were planning to get them both
phones over the summer as they would be
starting sixth grade next year that's
the phone year as we know
uh unfortunately covet hit now that
they'd be home all day we saw no reason
to give them phones as they already had
cellular ipad minis and we're going to
get laptops for school
flash forward to this school year my
sons are both going to middle school
after doing sixth grade virtually they
reminded us we were going to get them
phones once their school restarted but
my wife recently lost her job and found
a much lower paying one so we were
trying to get our finances back on track
they haven't been doing so well this
year last quarter they brought home
report cards with b's c's and f's info
what were the f's in
if they were in
gym
big whoop
it was in art
big whoop short stories
how'd they do in novellas though
uh
so they're not doing so well i was a bit
disappointed told them i didn't want to
reward them with phones for a report
card like that and i would need a's or
b's for a phone they also haven't been
doing so wait that's the same i told
them i would work with them and get them
a tutor but they also needed to work too
look at this smiling baby
hello

bit a lot oh

she didn't have the bento but she ate
the food that the daycare lady oh okay

bye bye

bye bye
i'm glad she did okay at the
at the daycare you know it's a big day
for a kid
go meet some uh
some peers
be taken care of by an adult who's
essentially like a stranger to you
anyway getting back to uh yeah insulting
these parents
[Laughter]
i told them i would work with them and
get them a tutor but they also had to
work hard too
i see where they get it from
a typo not on my watch they had this
quarter to work and earn their phone
i reminded them that if one of them
ended up getting the grades required and
the other one didn't i would only be
buying a phone for the one who got the
grades over the next two weeks i began
to see major improvement from both bob
and joe however as a few more weeks went
by i could see bob slacking off my wife
and i kept trying to get him motivated
but he just didn't try
flash forward to last week and i got the
report cards back joe's been working
like a machine for the past quarter and
it really showed he got all a's not one
b bob on the other hand slipped back
into the b and c range
i was tracking their progress on my
phone throughout the quarter and during
the last week i went out and brought
bought joe's iphone 12 and kept it until
that day
i knew at this point there was no way
for bob to catch up there were no
quizzes scheduled for the week but i
went and bought a pair of air pods for
him after calling and asking my wife if
it was okay with her
what's he gonna use the airpods with his
cellular ipad mini come on man
he's he's gonna be
he's gonna be laughed at
cause you got those plugged into your
your ipod mini that doesn't have access
to
oh wait the cellular one that's the good
one right
wi-fi only is the
that's the the cheap ipad well the
cheaper ipad
also known as the one we have because
i've never seen our ipad leave our our
home um
i think i may be the ass oh hold on it's
been a week since then and bob has
barely said a word to me my wife or joe
so a week is a long time in the world of
a 12 year old
i don't want bob to feel as we chose joe
over him so i'm considering buying him
the phone to make him feel better but my
wife thinks since we give them both the
same choice it was fair i think i may be
the [ __ ] as this has driven a rift
through the family bob on one side and
the rest of us on the other so am i the
[ __ ] edit to everyone saying the
phone is out of our budget we had more
than enough to buy the phone on contract
so that part wasn't a big deal oh update
okay so this was all a joke apparently i
talked to bob and was about to start
apologizing
when
hold what he told me it was all a joke i
figured this was him just being
defensive but he seemed pretty insistent
on it i got my wife and joe in the room
and apparently this was all a stupid
joke they cooked up i don't know whether
to be mad at them or relieved that bob
at least has a bright future in acting
your wife was in on it
so you're
either your kid
said to your wife hey you know what'd be
a great prank on our dad is to make me
think i hate him in all of you
or your wife came up with it and was
like it'd be really funny if you'd
gaslight your father into thinking that
he ruined our family uh
and then she was like yeah that's a good
idea
for a week for for even for an hour
that's kind of [ __ ] up
to just play with someone's emotions
like that um
but for a week
like you you probably ruined a week of
this man's life
just
for for what
what dude you should have seen your face
it was so funny when you thought your
son would never talk to you again
it was so funny when you
you thought
that you had completely torpedoed one
twin's relationship with his other twin
over an iphone 12.
the only
look the only thing i can say here is
i
yes that maybe this is a face saving
move okay
maybe this is a situation where
the the mom talked to the kid and was
like knock that out
and the kid was like let's pretend it
was all just a laugh and we'll just
build the future of our family on a
foundation of lies
i
believe it or not that's the good
outcome here because if
it was actually
a joke
like
from the inception
you have to
send your wife to
counseling like immediately she needs to
know that that would you ever feel
secure
and trusting in your relationship ever
again knowing that at any point
your emotions could be
responsible
the only reason you're feeling these
emotions is because she wants to prank
you for like a week or more
it's just bizarre man
anyway let's assume that we're not
reading the update because i think it
was
more cut and dry then i don't know this
is like the classic
it's the the the classic parental
dilemma right
you want to incentivize your child to do
something usually something good do
better in school do your chores whatever
um you threaten a punishment if they
don't do it they don't do it now what do
you do hot shot
you know are you gonna are you gonna
stick to your principles even though you
know it's gonna upset them
maybe [ __ ] your life up for a bit uh or
are you gonna relent give them the thing
they wanted anyway and then maybe teach
them the lesson that they never have to
ever follow through on a promise because
of the fact that they
uh can just cry and then get what they
wanted you know it's it's an
uncomfortable position to be in
that's i don't i don't know
i i feel like
well here's the thing okay i hate to
become like a lawyer
i need a's and b's for a phone okay can
i get that written up like in a tort law
context there's no question joe should
get a phone if you wanted to be the
worst parent on earth you say joe sorry
i can't get you a phone because bob got
one c that is how you end up not having
a relationship with your children after
they leave home you'll never talk to
them again
it would be kind of funny if it happened
on a tv show or something like that but
in real life it's over the line
they'll hate each other for sure um
that's an ancillary though uh ancillary
sorry it's one of those words i've been
mispronouncing forever um
joe
did well deserves a phone bob it's look
i
i don't know where i would come down on
this one i was gonna say can you get bob
like a like a like an lg chocolate or
something like that
uh
and then put parental controls on it so
like all he can use it for is to like
phone home
and
like i kind of feel like
maybe this is not a popular opinion or
maybe it is but i feel like
you want your kid to have a cell phone
that you don't want them to necessarily
have access to like you know robin hood
but you want your kid to be able to
phone you if they get into trouble or i
don't know phone the police or something
like that phone their school
um yeah you want your kid to have at
least some kind of
connectivity right um
so
i think you gotta give him
i think you gotta give him an lg
chocolate man i think it's the only the
only way
and then if he gets one
one quarter
of a better performance on his report
card then you can upgrade him to that
you can upgrade him to the iphone 12
iphone 12 rose gold plus with a 4k
screen
and the airpod pros
i don't like being this guy okay because
like
it takes something like this to get me
to be this guy
but you can't
be
it it harms your
case to be like we had money problems so
he didn't get him phones
my son didn't fulfill his end of the
bargain so instead of getting them an
iphone 12 i got them airpods
it's just
i'm not telling them they can't spend
their money like that and clearly their
financial situation has changed over the
course of the past year i'm just saying
it you could get cheaper
i'm not saying airpods are bad or
they're not worth it but he's a 12 year
old kid do you know how many airpods i
would have lost at age 12
they don't have cords
they don't
i'd they'd be dropping out of my ears
all the time man you're chewing gum
jaw muscle pops an air pot out goes
right down the sewer grate you go
i want my air puff back all of a sudden
you know you're getting abducted by
pennywise the clown
i guess they could just buy more
gripsy
okay okay
we all drip down here bob
wicked by the way wicked yeah babe
wicked mouth yeah bib
am i the [ __ ] for taking my
girlfriend home early from a party
hold on i'm just
just looking
just looking really wristers
holy crap
you want to know like as you get older
why you're like less interested in going
out to parties and getting hammered
thursday night at 8 30 a text rolls in
hey you want to come over tomorrow it's
going to be fun
saturday morning 11 a.m
holy birch
and then i can't believe that she would
and then i was said and then i do i just
wanted to take a seat on the couch oh
but just because you've had 17 mcclay's
all of a sudden i can't sit on the couch
you want to [ __ ] fight with me what's
your problem and then i wanted to eat
the last slice of pizza but i couldn't
eat all that size of pizza because the
fridge was getting blocked by people
standing next to the keg all night and
remember i heard it heard me or heard me
okay this might be our last one let's go
let's go hey reddit what's going on
what's going on hey guys what's going on
i'm in a little bit of a jam not click
bait so a few nights ago me 22f 22m and
my partner 19f went to my school
friend's house for a party we've been
dating for two weeks and have known each
other for about six months
there i
everybody chill
but i think there should be a rule you
can't
bring your relationship problem to
reddit
when you've been dating for two weeks
it's just not enough
like you you need to
at least cross
i'm going to say three months then you
reach a point where like
the government has figured out that this
is not an anti-money laundering
situation like you're an actual couple
now we can start to work from the
position that you guys are building
something together not just like i mean
that two two weeks ago
that that was like
i don't even know that was like
thanksgiving
canadian thanksgiving sorry sorry so so
you've been boyfriend and girlfriend for
two social occasions now uh her her
father has been a little suspect of me
as i am three years older which i
totally understand because it played on
my mind too before i asked her out but
she's just amazing in all ways and i
can't imagine myself with somebody else
look i'm getting too into this
i bet it's not always she's 19 years old
you're telling me she can parallel park
on a busy downtown street at rush hour
she's amazing in all ways she's 19.
you ever see her do her taxes
i'm just i'm just saying
anyway the other just don't lie that's
all i'm asking okay just don't lie
anyway the other night i took her to my
mate's place for a party as i wanted to
introduce her to all my school friends
she checked with her old man and he said
yes as long as she's back by 10 pm
another consideration is that she
doesn't drive well
well well
what did i tell you
i can spot him a mile away
i said yep no problem and she agreed too
on the way to the party she tells me
just ignore her dad have a few drinks
and then drive me home in the morning
i protested and said no i want to earn
her old man's trust
and show him respect
you know
maybe start just calling him her dad
instead of old man every time would be
nice um
this hurt as i wanted nothing more than
to spend the night together but felt it
was right on the way to the party she'd
okay yeah so 9 30 rolls around i say to
her let's go i don't want to be late i
then turn to a maid and say leave that
whiskey for me i got some catching up to
do when i get back
she
20 22 year olds uh
version of what being a classy older
gentleman is like
save that whisk in in their head save
that whiskey for me i'll have some
catching up to do when i get back
me observing it as a 32 year old save
that whiskey for me i'll have some
catching up to do when i get back
she protests saying she's having a
really good time she doesn't want to go
keep it civil and eventually she agrees
and we leave in the car i explain to her
my stance and reinforce how much i don't
want to do this she's just quiet when i
get back to her place and open the door
her father answers and says thank you
and what you've done means a lot i say
too easy and accept his handshake
she said dude too easy that's so by the
way i'm on this guy's side right now
it's just really funny
too easy
yeah too easy why don't you make it 7
p.m next time and then i swear to god
her old man turned to me and said
challenge accepted
my partner is still annoyed hinting that
she thinks this isn't going to work i
don't want this to be over she is
amazing in every way
maybe not behind the wheel and i
understand that what i did was sexist as
i was putting the wants of her the
father over her
and i do not want him to stop me from
seeing her as he didn't trust me so read
it am i the [ __ ] not sexist i think
i would not go that far
sexism is not when you have a
disagreement with your partner who is a
woman
just a quick edit wow cheers for your
input
also one thing i want to add oh cheers
for all your input guys
little sexist
now
now you're losing me jeff probst however
you are on reddit
so statistically speaking this is
probably largely accurate
as a result i'm going to say
we're moving on i also want to add i
made it clear when we're discussing this
this was only a one maybe two time
things i want her dad to trust me not
worry about his daughter when we're out
together
and she didn't get shouted out when we
got home so that we can spend more
nights out together this will not be
occurring in the future
and i did not get any joy whatsoever
from doing this it's the polar opposite
of what i personally wanted to do
duh
i just did what i felt was right so we
can continue seeing each other all's
good in the world just got off the phone
from her and her old man her old man
again thanked me then told me he will no
longer be imposing any restrictions to
us going out yay and that apologized for
putting me in a hard situation he was
just very wary of the age gap he then
left the room or at least i hope he did
ha ha
this is all just very normal right now
like this is not that
it's not that crazy
the better half you okay look man
you've been dating for two weeks
you can't be calling her your better
half already that's like uh
that's like a married for five years
sort of thing maybe like 25 years
the better half then popped on
said she understood my reasoning and
that he her dad told her after i dropped
her off i didn't bring her back he would
have forced her to break up with me
after reflection for the post here i
apologize for heading back to the party
where she responded with why shouldn't
you enjoy yourself because my dad's a
downer what an [ __ ] man
can you bring my 19 year old daughter
back by 10
then also like such a disciplinarian he
then called me back and said sorry for
putting you in a tough spot
i was just concerned about my child
[ __ ] [ __ ] yes sir sir yes sir
i'll have your daughter back by 10 p.m
so yeah
we then had a laugh and made plans for
tonight no curfew in sight edit number
three
thanks guys for your input we broke up
however i've seen a few people placing
my girlfriend into an [ __ ] category
which i think is a little unfair hey you
guys thanks for your input
thanks for all your support guys
but listen
some of you
been calling my better half an [ __ ]
i'm more than happy to accept i was
somewhat of an ass
and so was the father yeah in absolutely
no way whatsoever
really were either of you the [ __ ] at
all maybe you shouldn't have gone back
to the party but i think you probably
should have
but like
no you didn't neither no one involved
really did anything wrong at all however
my girlfriend
is an awesome kind person who just
wanted to spend time with me in no way
would she want to cause an argument with
her old man over this because she
doesn't like conflict
she's just one of those people that
doesn't like conflict you know she's
drama free she's my better half
she's good at everything except parking
please be understanding that she is from
a strict household
so yes sir sir
which makes it incredibly tough to stand
up for herself she is no
[ __ ] sir
i will defend her honor as is necessary
it all worked out fine look at all this
is like emblematic of so much young
adult drama and i you know i had my own
dose of it for sure it was like all this
[ __ ] look at this look at the wasted
time
dozens of man hours like reading
comments
replying comments like just sapping the
productivity of the reddit using world
and then it's like we had a conversation
on the phone everything's fine the end

am i the [ __ ] for being hurt after my
friend said i helped her come out as gay
and then removed and also given the
[ __ ] tag but i try to respect other
people finally at this point in my life
i i don't see the need to um
you know go into the the deep web to
dunk on them further it is what it is i
should have been here earlier but it
happens
how about this this one's kind of
driving me crazy man when i saw this one
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to open
the car door for my the door for my
husband and forcing him to spend the
night in the garage
that seems bad
and she's not the [ __ ] somehow
i mean i i kind of feel like she
we got to find out how my husband
recently
female 29 male husband 33 it checks out
okay hey
everybody call off the dogs
for
six weeks
this is going to be the age difference
between myself and my wife
between november and january
of this year so i don't want to hear any
monkey staged uh difference
you pieces
he's been feeling upset ever since oh
sorry he got relevant detail he got
kicked out of his job
and decided to sue his former boss for
misjudgment he's been feeling upset ever
since he really worked hard to get his
position
and seeing years of work go to waste was
devastating for him
his friends have been taking him out to
cheer him up and let off some steam the
problem is that he'd be gone for hours
and show up
late at night drunk he did it two times
this week he came home at 2am while
drunk and made noise because he expected
me to open the door for him while i was
asleep i couldn't wait for him and stay
up late because unlike him i have work
and other responsibilities
sounds like maybe there's a little bit
of resentment involved
unlike him i have work look that's like
an insult but it's true like it at least
that hits
other responsibilities that hurts that's
that's an unnecessary
motivated by anger comment to put at the
end there just to make him seem like a
loser which
let's read further um
when he complained about how i should be
quick to open the door for him i told
him next time he comes home late at 2
a.m and
up then i won't be opening the door for
him period
he said he won't stay out late again and
that my challenge was accepted did he
really say challenge accepted
because if this is the case you are not
the [ __ ] for making him sleep in the
garage
did he do the challenge accepted
anyway
last night when he went out with his
buddy he dropped him off at outside at 2
30 a.m i was awake at the time when my
husband kept ringing the bell and then
knocking on the door i remained in bed
and refused to open the door he called
my phone telling me he was outside and i
needed to open up i asked him to tell me
what time it was and he said it's 7 30
it's still early come on open up the
door
one of the most brazen lies you will
ever hear in your entire life
to just
[Laughter]
look if you got the persuasion 100 to
get that off more power to you but
that's that's like the most
uh verifiably false lie you could ever
you couldn't have just said like it's 11
30 like you had to pick a time when
maybe the sun is still up
um he kept calling over and over and
then knocked several times then he
stopped turns out he slept in the garage
on the floor he had a huge argument with
me calling me petty and ridiculous for
keeping him out of his house and
refusing to open the door for him i
reminded him that i didn't have to stay
up every week to wait for him and open
the door for him he said he forgot his
key and i was clearly trying to prove a
point here but he said it's his house i
should never keep him out of it like
that he told me to apologize and say
i'll never do it again
but i walked out the kitchen i walked
out the kitchen while he was talking
which pissed him off more than he said
he was going through rough times and i
was making it worse and being
unsupportive okay
i am going to say
based there's no edits here which i
respect
for me
this is a big everybody sucks here
let's go over the the facts and and my
interpretation of the case okay
the husband sucks there's no doubt he is
an [ __ ] in this situation
um
whether he's going through a tough time
or not he uh
you know who cares if you go out and you
get uh
drunk with your friends if you come in
yourself
uh phrasing if you open the door
yourself and have the means to you know
sleep on the couch or whatever and not
be as disruptive as you were then you
know that's a you can still be
frustrated but that's a different story
you know
but to constantly be coming back and
then um not being able to enter the
house your wife has to open the door
you're waking her up at 2 a.m just
because you you know are irresponsible
that's rude and
you promised you wouldn't do it again
and then you did it again that makes you
either the [ __ ] for promising without
having the intention to follow through
or alternatively
um
for having the intention but making no
preparation whatsoever this is an
[ __ ] move
now can i tell you i don't actually
think
that he is the [ __ ]
for being mad that she didn't open the
door
i feel like you as a spouse
you have like an obligation to um
help your spouse out in a situation like
that where they don't go
they don't have the means to get into
the house like
i i even if
like i'm i'm putting myself in like a
you know in their shoes right
we kate and i have had sleep schedule
differences prior to the baby you know
sometimes like i would go to bed at like
midnight and she would be doing some
like savage type rate and final fantasy
that went on a little later um so i can
relate to the the sleep schedule
difference and you know
being like why are you making such you
know clackity-clackity in the other room
while i'm trying to sleep however
um
you know if if she was like hey i really
need your help right now sorry to wake
you up and it was like an emergency on
this level you got to just bite the
bullet you have like a crappy sleep and
then the next day you have the moral
high ground
and you you just come over the top in
the argument and win easily and then
you know make make your point much more
known
you have to like
make them feel bad about it and then
hopefully it modifies their behavior and
if it doesn't you can go from there i
will see you know what i do agree with
what chad's saying though that
a a 33 year old man
for getting the key to his own home
enough that he has to wake up his wife
at 2 am is mega cringe energy
like i i i just don't understand do you
not do the do you not do the the
the pants
do you not do the the
the three pocket pad like every five
minutes you're outside
you got a triple tap you got a wallet
you got your phone you got your keys it
took me a while because i grew up in a
pre-cell phone era and i didn't carry my
keys around you know when i was a little
kid right so i just had a little wallet
tap until i was like 14 15 years old and
now you got the key tap as well and then
you get a phone tap in there too and
it's just like how do you not have your
keys
how do you not have your i just don't
understand
i do it five times a day i'm gonna be i
i probably do it
i wouldn't be so if on a weekend day
where i've been walking around maybe
we're out a little bit i wouldn't be
surprised if i did it 20 times a day
easily and you know you do the tap
not just to make sure that it's there
but because you know when you go into
like a bathroom and you can see the
schedule of when the bathroom has been
cleaned it's like that
because you can not only are you like oh
my wallet's missing or something now you
go back into the ledger and you're like
the last time i did the tap my wallet
was there i was at best buy so i have
lost my wallet somewhere between best
buy and the next tap which was 35
seconds later so then you just mentally
like map the 35 seconds that have passed
and you're like oh i left it on the
counter when i paid for my cell phone
case or something
you just you're just you're tapping
non-stop it's it's these are important
data points okay
anyway
a a grown man for getting his keys this
much or getting so intoxicated he can't
maintain the position of his keys is is
mega cringe
that's that's my
uh that's my philosophy here so but i
still think it's everybody sucks here
you know you're married to the guy you
can't just lock him out of the house
that's like a divorceable moment
like no
no jury on earth would be like you know
based
i think they would be like you really
let made your husband sleep in the
garage
when you had already woken up to tell
him you won't open the door like
it's one of those things where it's like
you were so morally in the right
all you had to do was do the right thing
the ethical thing
and then everyone would be on your side
instead you went i have cause to be
upset so i'm gonna like hit you with
mjolnir
and now everybody's like 50 50. so i am
i'm a little surprised honestly
that that we have 64 not the [ __ ] and
only 22
everybody sucks here um
i i would have thought there'd be more
everybody sucks here honestly but the
only thing i will say is like one of the
things that on the internet is most
despisable by the plurality is uh
breaking a promise or being inconsistent
in any way with what you said you would
do
like if you said you would murder
somebody and then you didn't it would
still be like 50 50. people would be
like on the one hand it's good he didn't
commit a murder but on the other hand he
promised so
you know it's a bit of a gray area
people are they put a lot of value on
never having any level of cognitive
dissonance which i think is a little bit
unrealistic but anyway
um
let me see
here
he's a grown-ass man with a key stop
opening up for him
until he learns to take responsibility
for himself and remembers his key not
the [ __ ] see like this i agree
for sure i think there's a little
there's a step further you know which is
like
she still should have opened up the door
for him
he's sleeping on the garage floor i
don't know where they live right but
he's sleeping on the garage floor in
october
that's it's been like six degrees here
lately
like that would be
that would we would wake up like
insanely cold
tomorrow you doing okay back there
honestly i thought you would be but not
the [ __ ] he said
challenge accepted
he said challenge accepted and didn't
take his key that's on him he said the
the the words of power
not the [ __ ] but you're a husband
your husband appears to be in a bad way
after his job loss yes
for sure also how do adults not have
keys to their own homes i'm getting i'm
getting mired in the minutia here a
little bit but this is what bothers me
the most like you ever think that this
is like
um
this is a solution where you could just
go to the dollar store and for like 1.99
you could just get like a like a key
ring or something you could even attach
it to your belt or something man it's
not that stylish but it's better than
sleeping on the garage floor
it sounds like he needs counseling
pronto before he develops alcoholism
look
it's you can't say that from
this data point it's like he's well he
was out like two times this week that's
i mean it's
by the way how did he get home was he
riding in a car with a drunk driver did
i ever tell you the story about how like
this this [ __ ] pisses me off okay cause
it's like it is safe
but it's like such a high degree of like
assumed
guilt that it annoys me but this story
of i was at a house party uh after
it was like spring break of my first
year of college
and uh when you got there you had to
pull your car keys in like a
you know the cabinet or something so
that you didn't take your car and drive
home drunk which was not a risk to begin
with but anyway
i uh got drunk at the party
then i started to feel mighty ill i was
18 years old right i was starting to
feel mighty ill and i was trying to
because other people were coming down
with a little illness as well it seemed
like there might be something going
around
i was trying to like solicit a ride to
get home and my friend's mom who
happened to be there was like sure i'll
drive you home but to get keys
from the the person that was manning the
key cabinet i had to go through like the
[ __ ] third degree they were like i'm
not gonna give you your keys you're
you're drunk and i'm like i know i'm
drunk i'm getting a ride home i need my
keys to get into my house and they're
like i don't trust you you could just be
lying to me to get your keys so you can
drive drunk and then i was like my
friend's mom
the host mom
is like in her pajamas right now she's
downstairs do you think this is like
part of this elaborate ruse i just need
you to give me the keys to my own house
it took like you know 15 minutes of of
trying to convince them honestly good
friend not not at all
i just needed i needed my own house keys
not a not a good friend in the slightest
they they live in a world of delusional
fear
where they think you know people are
constantly doing like a conspiracy to
like you know jokes on them now i'm
gonna die
anyway i don't know she was just she was
i think she just got a little taste of
power and then she was like
this feels good
bow down you want your own house keys
back go [ __ ] yourself
i think that's she she can't be trusted
in a position of authority
i wasn't bald back then she wasn't
intimidated by my scalp okay
anyways and apparently now she posts on
reddit by the way how did he get home
was he riding in a car with a drunk
driver probably he should be in prison
maybe for life um
not the [ __ ] can we get somebody
that's like you know i just want the
slightest degree of dissent here hi so
i've done this but on purpose with a
deadbolt i left a pillow and blanket on
the stoop through the deadbolt and went
to bed at 3am three hours after he said
he was getting in an uber right now and
then stopped responding
look
that's
actually i can relate
that's annoying i would be annoyed as
hell
if kate was like i'm getting in an uber
and then three hours later she still was
not home
but you can't
look i'm gonna be the stereo i'm gonna
be the classic example
like
if a wife did this to her husband people
are like that's an episode of everybody
loves raymond if a husband did it to his
wife it's an episode of a new television
program called the worst husbands on
[ __ ] planet earth
[Laughter]
you can't always get reverse the roles
to
to to come up with a point but
definitely like
if a wife locking her husband out
culturally is kind of like well he did
he made a mistake and you know
hahaha i had to sleep on the stoop last
night you know how it is
if you're like i was i locked my wife
outside last night
because she didn't come home by 2 a.m
you would be people would be like
you are
[ __ ] crazy you are insane
now i'm not saying that's right i'm just
saying you locked your wife outside of
the house
are you crazy
anyway
um
mine was distraught and embarrassed
begged me to never do it again part of
the reason i did it i was so furious i
would have blown up when he did arrive
and he'd have remembered none of it our
solution was that next time i'd just
leave instead
so i get a nice trip to a hotel he gets
to come home to a cold bed and sit and
wonder if i'm ever coming back hasn't
happened yet as we've worked on the
reason he blacks out instead okay so
there it it's a nice ending at least
that they that it's never happened since
but
that's the kind of ultimatum that that's
that's a bit troubling um
anyway
hey everyone stopping by to be negative
please include stories of your superior
coping skills with the alcoholic in your
immediate family okay thanks
so it's so
just so combative at all times
you know it just annoys me it's
combative
when they're replying to like just the
op like it's not like they're replying
to somebody who said like hey you know
you're an idiot they're just like
apropos of nothing at all they're well i
guess they're replying to the people who
are in their dms so fair enough
info why was your husband fired they
accused him of bribery and tampering
with work files which he never did his
former boss said he could get him in
huge legal trouble but decided to just
let him go since he was one of the best
workers at the company
my husband then filed a report and
decided to sue his former boss for
accusing him of something he didn't do
and threatening legal actions that seems
just like your classic little
your classic situation
that old song and dance the you you
bribed and tampered with work files but
you're such a good employee that instead
of getting the law involved i'm just
gonna fire you and then you're gonna sue
me for accusing me of something i didn't
do okay sure
everybody sucks here okay yeah yeah yeah
he sounds like he has a drinking problem
and obviously he should bring his key
with him but you were awake and should
have just let him in and had a serious
adult conversation with him about it you
were being petty
that's phineas finally i after
well not that much scrolling but still
plus it was only 7 30.
hold on where was here we go
she's already done that he keeps doing
it so the solution is to be petty
setting a specific boundary and sticking
to it is not petty if she opens the door
he knows he can just keep doing it tell
me you look at human beings like you're
training a dog without telling me you
look at human beings like you're
training a dog how many times until it's
not petty in your eyes his actions are
passive aggressive and juvenile see i
can throw around buzzwords too i love
this [ __ ] man
i i absolutely love this [ __ ]
apparently by the way petty is a
buzzword i don't know if you've been
watching the
the merriam-webster power rankings
lately
but it's been rising the charts it's
been going crazy
sticking to a specific completely
ridiculous boundary is dumb if the
boundary is petty to begin with it isn't
worth enforcing there are much better
ways to handle this minus seven i mean i
kind of agree with some of the down
votes like i don't know if it's a
ridiculous boundary
minus seven is maybe a little much
i love they keep bringing up challenge
accepted
after saying challenge accepted he does
it again two days later and there's no
way you can convince me this was
accidental
the source of a true logician this was a
power play plain and simple he really
didn't believe she would enforce a
boundary she did hey husband is me op
i'm really worried about your drinking
and think you need to stop
or seek help in quitting i can't and
won't live like this anymore i really
need to see you trying here i'm not sure
if i can keep this relationship going
with you anymore even though i love you
the adult boundary oh
man
get me out of there anyway
moving on um
i think that's that's a big everybody
sucks there
am i the [ __ ] so many not the
[ __ ] here congrats or sorry that
happened to you or whatever
am i the [ __ ] for shutting down my
daughter's business
my daughter's school doesn't offer an
online copy of most textbooks and their
textbooks are heavy so whenever a class
starts a new chapter she scans the
chapter in the textbook onto her tablet
uses the tablet in class people started
asking her for copies so she charges
five dollars per chapter she has
approximately 100 clients and makes
around 600 and 900 dollars a month holy
burst
[Laughter]
oh my god
yo okay so i gotta be careful here
um
because i mean this is illegal but she's
also a minor which means nothing's uh
illegal for her right
unless she kills someone in cold blood
she's like she's got complete immunity
to all legal proceedings what are they
gonna do put her in juvenile hall
for the the the crime of textbook
scanning
i don't think so
i think she can get away with it quite
frankly plus the other thing i wanted
the parents might go to jail they can't
do that the sins of the the sins of the
father passed to the sins of the the sun
the that's into the sun don't pass to
the father it's a one-way transition
it's like rna polymerase
now
the other thing i want to say is
stealing is bad but the textbook
cartel um
honestly couldn't happen to like uh
a nicer industry
changing six words in your textbook uh
releasing it as a new addition charging
fifty dollars more uh
if you sell your book back to the campus
bookstore they give you 35 cents and
then they sell it as a used book that's
ten dollars cheaper than the new version
of the book
it's it's uh
it's a scam man it's a scam so i'm not
saying i support this
but i am saying it's not like she's
stealing onions from the soup kitchen
you know she's
she's putting a little dent in mcgraw
hill okay
that that's all i'm saying now let
people start okay she's making 600 and
900 bucks a month
many people would say good for her i'm
not saying this is me saying good for
her i'm just saying many people would
say good for her very creative
i didn't know she was doing this until i
saw that she was making a lot of large
purchases new ipad phone and macbook
nice clothes doordashing food at least
once a week
and when i asked how she got the money
she told me i told her that taking money
from her classmates isn't okay
and told her to shut it down and she
threw a tantrum because it's easy money
and because her dad is fine with it okay
here's the thing all right
it there is a seed of wrongness in here
and the wrongness is that it's not her
property
to distribute for money
that's that's the seed of wrongness
whether you believe that the wrongness
overtakes the baseness okay
the reason it's it would be wrong is not
because taking money from her classmates
isn't okay this is
the foundation
of
society
in almost every country across planet
earth
it's it's commerce you know it's it's
business
you know if you run a coffee shop you're
taking money from your customers
you're providing them a service or a
product in exchange for it what do you
mean it's not okay to take money from
her classmates
so some dude who just puts a bunch of
oregano in ziploc bags is able to do it
but but helping kids study better is not
uh
it doesn't warrant a financial
compensation
i i
is i can't remember this is the the dad
or the mom we don't know yet oh
okay i like maybe the mom but either way
i think she doesn't fully understand
that
uh
how the world works but maybe that's a
thing to say um she's staying with my ex
and won't talk to me so i want to know
if i was the [ __ ] okay so i have to
come down after being very non-committal
i have to come down here at some point
i
believe it or not
actually think she's not the [ __ ]
but i don't think
it's because
well i would yeah you know what i'll
take it a step further i would say no
[ __ ] i forgot that you can get a no
[ __ ] ranking as well
i would say that she's not the [ __ ]
but not for the reasons that she put out
here like i don't think she's a good
person
in this situation
for
stopping her from getting money from her
classmates because it seems like she's
providing a great service i mean like
five bucks a chapter is that's a lot
she's kind of positioning herself as
like the new mcgraw-hill i suppose but
you know
either way i i do understand that uh
you know she she thinks that's the
problem for me the actual problem if i
put myself in her shoes is that
the odds of her facing a problem for
this
are probably somewhat low but it is
certainly
if not outright illegal which it might
be
um
something that she could face some
serious reprimanding for
uh
which
as a parent would would make me want to
shut it down probably as well especially
because like like in a way i'd be proud
of her for the having an entrepreneurial
spirit
but
i would also be like
this could [ __ ] your whole life up like
right before college maybe or
or maybe not but
i don't know like i feel like if you
could
not get into college because you didn't
join like the debate club in ninth grade
you also could be like
you know hurt your chances by running an
illegal textbook piracy ring or maybe
alternatively
the wharton school of business would be
like oh hell yeah
we're going to put you in our fast track
ceo mentorship program i'm not sure
um but as a parent
i i mean
look this this is just my model for
parenting at least um
your role as like a high school student
from 9th grade to 12th grade let my role
as a parent feed you mentor you provide
a safe place
for you to sleep in eat a sounding board
for you to run the problems by me as you
transition from you know childhood to
adulthood and having more
responsibilities etc etc your
responsibility in high school is like
just don't [ __ ] up so bad
that's it like
just just go to school
come home
socialize a little bit but not in like a
deleterious way that you take it too far
that's what college is for just you know
do your time get out and then out of
sight out of mind to some extent so
i think they are breaching the terms of
the agreement right here
by running an illegal textbook piracy
ring
[Laughter]
if i was
17 and i was their friend i would be
like that's based
i would also be like give me all the
textbooks for free or i'm gonna report
you to mcgraw-hill
because
you're dealing with
machiavelli you know you gotta you gotta
have some daggers of your own quite
frankly
you know otherwise you if you don't have
some kind of leverage over them
they're going to take you for everything
your work you're worth you know for it's
maybe it's five bucks a chapter in
september but then the midterms are
coming up oh sorry surge pricing now
it's 25 bucks a chapter
i anyway this is a a very like
even split
i just look and i i understand there's
room for differences of opinion right
i just can't imagine
adults writing this and being like
maybe maybe they think that the mom's
the [ __ ] for another reason like the
way she handled it but i can't imagine
being like 30 years old and being like
you should have respected your
daughter's hustle and let her
run an illegal textbook piracy ring uh
in the
in her senior year of high school
then again i'm surprised a lot so
let's see
isn't it illegal yes it's quick money
but so is theft okay yeah the true maybe
sort of not the [ __ ] applaud her
entrepreneurial spirit she saw a need
and found a way to fill it
uh and make money that's awesome point
out she's committing a crime and her and
her parents can be held legally legal
and financially responsible uh offer to
help her find legal ways to start her
own business
look number number c
number three
great piece of advice but
i did you know what this is this is on
shark tank
this is not a business this is a product
she doesn't have a business and for that
reason i'm out
what are you going to do have her open
up her own college bookstore like
it she she doesn't have it's not
scalable
you're going to buy her like a sick
scanner or something like that i don't
understand anyway um
not the [ __ ] but not for your
reasoning there's nothing wrong with
making money off your classmates if
she's offering a valuable service
they're paying for convenience but she
is breaking the law look at dude this is
like a new record
we are like that we found
my exact take
like three comments in and the first two
were not horrible either the first two
were pretty reasonable
comment deleted by user
what she's doing is illegal
you're the [ __ ] for your reasoning
yeah okay like everybody seems to be on
like the same page here
more power to you
would i be the [ __ ] if i didn't
actually read my students short story
i love a teaching
am i the [ __ ]
oh no
okay get ready
sorry for the throwaway but i feel like
this might be a tad unprofessional to
ask so out of an overabundance of
caution i don't want this attached to my
main account
oh hold on hold on i just realized i got
a i i have an urgent message to send
because i forgot how uh time zones work
okay
not not for the people that i'm working
with for back for blood but i hold on i
i thought that i started an hour early
okay sorry we are running it
one to two i forgot what time it
is today there we go okay
see no problem no problem the docket
doesn't change i just needed to send a
message up the up the chain
um
back to reddit court
anyways on tuesday i assigned a creative
writing assignment for my students for
context they're 11th graders they had
wednesday to work on it then a four day
long weekend to finish or edit it to be
submitted on monday okay
now i [ __ ] up at two vertices you sure
you're not a math teacher i'm teaching
four classes this semester and i
assigned it to all four on the same day
so on monday i received about 90 short
stories to read in grade i set a minimum
of one page but did not set a maximum
word count that's tough that's
that is bad
i miss the part where that's my problem
i've been blowing through them at a rate
of 15 a day shortest to longest but it's
going to be much harder to keep this
pace up now the last nine are at least 4
500 words long but still it's doable but
i swear to god one of my students wrote
me a novella i ran it through a word
counter and this thing is 22 000 words
long he did this in five days i am so
tempted to just read the first chapter
or two and give him 105 on the
assignment but would i be the [ __ ] if
i did that i mean he put in all that
work but sweet jesus
would it even harm him if i didn't would
it just straight up be unprofessional
and it's a sci-fi story literally my
most hated genre i can read a short
story but i don't want to read a whole
ass novella do i have to next time the
cap is ten thousand words five thousand
if it's sci-fi
i like that very clever
very clever
she you know the teacher here they're
writing in a very tight it's you can
tell
this is like one of the one percent of
people on the internet that are able to
make a complete sentence that makes
coherent sense and also conjures a
certain emotion in the people that are
reading it well played you're already
anti you are the [ __ ] points for that
you're you're you're starting from ahead
of the curve so ethically speaking do i
have to read it edit for some extra
context he asked for an extension on
monday so he could just have time to
polish it i told him i wouldn't subtract
marks from him if it's a little rough he
can just edit it on his own time
straight up
not the [ __ ]
no no [ __ ] here like come on
absolutely not
that the kid is not an [ __ ] if you
don't
you it happens sometimes you give
someone a creative piece of work
sometimes they just got nothing to do
on that weekend you know they might go
hard they might be like this is my
chance to really sink my teeth into this
um
you
22 000 words is 44 pages single spaced
and that's 44 pages in a word processor
right
like that's not 44 pages of like a
paperback novel you would keep in your
bathroom that's 44 single space paces
pages in microsoft word
so from a book context that could be
a hundred pages or something like that
um
or longer
yeah don't don't read that that's crazy
i i know okay because it it's the
internet logic
as well
um it's 100 to 130 pages holy crap
um
the internet logic is like well you made
the mistake by not uh putting a maximum
cap on it as a result you're like
morally obligated uh to to read it um
nah
i mean like you're morally incentivized
to read it but like
surely everyone agrees that there is a
bound at some point where like the logic
falls apart like if somebody wrote a 700
page
novel
should she be compelled to read it i
think at some point you just got to be
like i'm just going to give you an a
plus plus and move on
if it was a short story then the child
should fail well
the problem with that is as a teacher if
you failed the kid for
a structural reason such as that you
open yourself up to
uh
scrutiny
what i think you want to do is give them
such a good mark because they're they're
probably insanely proud of
what they wrote so you just give them
something that lines up with their
expectations and you go
you write wow a plus plus
i can see you put a lot of work into
this great job keep it up and then
you know i mean here's the thing what if
they if they if they filled 50 pages in
the middle with just like asdf asdf asdf
what are they going to do
are they going to go
um
to the principal and be like the teacher
didn't read this and blow up their a
plus or are they just going to take
their a plus plus and use that to
bolster their gpa
i don't think they
i don't think he's just i i don't i
don't think they're the [ __ ] at all
that's that's it
if he does it he's a legend
honestly i don't even think the
principal would reprimand the teacher
for that
i mean come on like just i i taught
classes in esl okay
my i'd have a class of 12 which was
small
uh and the assignment would be like
write a recipe and the recipe would be
like two paragraphs and every single one
was was how to make instant ramen and
they were all like and check this [ __ ]
out i crack an egg in it whoa and i was
like yeah so does everybody else in the
class okay that is easy in 45 minutes
you could read 12 of those
b plus a a a b plus you know blah blah
blah um
but when i think back to like my
you know like
even my middle school career they're
teaching a class of 30 kids 32 kids
they got to read 32 shitty sixth grade
essays about like whether or not school
uniforms should be
allowed or disallowed do you really
think that they're
pouring their heart and soul into
reading every single word and
it's ridiculous it's just
i mean it takes them 10 minutes
to do each essay that's reading
you know that's three hours
that's five hours
of uh of reading the same shitty essay
over i'm not saying they don't read the
essays i'm just saying they don't go
over them all with like a fine-toothed
comb you know they they
read them in a broad sense man why would
they become teachers then the same
reason like 80 of people become teachers
you know the guidance counselor in 12th
grade asked what do you want to do with
your life you spent your whole [ __ ]
life in school so far and you're like i
don't mind school maybe i'll just be a
teacher and then you go to school to
become a teacher because it's like a
stable job with a pension and you would
have a familiarity with the environment
and there's always a demand for lots of
them you know that's the whole
that's why you don't know nobody becomes
a teacher because they're like i love
reading shitty essays oh i just love
reading i love listening to fourth
graders give five-minute speeches about
adventure time
come on you know do you think they
wouldn't want to like be the taster at
the willy wonka's chocolate factory if
they had a choice they're filling a
societal need and it comes with
some employment benefits as well
yeah
also teaching is rewarding grading
it depends what you're grading but you
know grading is not fun
i can't and i was only doing like you
know 15
essays a week or something like that i
can't imagine if you're like
a high school teacher who teaches like
four periods of english a day
that's a lot man i'm just saying you
have my sympathy
long story short
not the [ __ ] but i i've i've gotta
read some of these
you are the [ __ ] oh man
oh
man
not cynical at all kappa it's not that
i mean i think it's just it's not meant
to be cynical it's naive if you think
like your essays in fifth grade were
like making your teacher's life better
she just wants to go home
you know have a glass of white wine put
on everybody loves raymond and like
knock this [ __ ] out before the next day
where she's gotta spend
all day in a in a portable outside
classroom made of like a retrofitted
shipping container in the middle of
[ __ ] june shits pure aluminum siding
on all sides
just baking in the sun like a solar
cooker
and her company is 30 5th graders who
have no respect for her whatsoever and
then like one kid who's like you're my
new surrogate mom
like you just they're the teacher is not
just a teacher right like they're a
human being
that has their own life that exists
outside of
work as well they don't exclusively
exist in order to you know make sure you
know how to spell like commitment or
something like that
anyway let's see let's let's read some
of the comments here
first of all this is hilarious second of
all you didn't specify a short story
your student wrote a novella
i'd say not the [ __ ] if you read a
chapter or two and graded it a hundred
percent if on the off chance your
student asked for feedback be honest you
had 90 stories to grade and didn't have
time to read the whole thing then say
something good about what you did read
teachers are human too boom easy
no problem
even less complicated and more honest
read part of the story if the quality is
good enough to warrant full credit award
full credit then actually say i didn't
read the whole thing but the part i did
read was already enough look
this is the this is not bad this is an
ethical and moral thing to do however
have you ever heard of the expression no
good deed goes unpunished this kid spent
a whole long weekend
probably part of the motivation for them
to write the story was they're gonna oh
man i wonder what they're gonna think of
when you know the cylons attack the
harpsichord gate or something like that
um
i don't think you need to provide this
information unless it's asked
uh
you you can withhold a little bit of
information or something like that you
don't you don't have to send it all
you know right
right out of the the the starting blocks
yes you're the [ __ ] oh here we go
long does not necessarily mean good it
could mean drawn out lacking focus a
variety of other problems or it could be
plain mediocre in fact the assessment
was short stories i'd be saying he
didn't meet the objective and would
likely get a worse mark
don't care didn't ask plus you used a
semicolon in your reddit comment
this automatically disqualifies you from
being on a jury of your peers
you are you are not the every person
okay
a good again by the way if i was
critiquing already needless semicolon to
reflect more positively on your
intelligence than your writing warrants
uh we do not bold things in academic
writing we let the construction of the
sentence provide the emphasis itself uh
without resorting to garish tactics like
this uh
similarly
an uh bold here and then on italic and
you're doing an italic into a bold like
i feel like i'm reading a ransom note
right now
it's a little too much let your writing
speak for itself please a good short
story is compelling and its writing is
tight again overuse of italics it
understands how a sentence flows to
create rhythm for the reader and
exploits that it takes time effort and
patience to do a short story
m-dash overused much more than to get to
the first draft of a novella oftentimes
often times one word we're going to draw
a little line under that that goes like
this a different discussion would be if
you stopped reading at the cutoff point
for an average short story i personally
when this situation comes up for me in
real life which happens all the time uh
i go by the definition of 7 500-ish
words since that's what it used to be
defined when sci-fi short stories were
all the rage back in the 80s but maybe
the same number of pages as the next
largest story
objection irrelevant
and
self-inflating
italics and grade based only if the
story you read was satisfactory m-dash
we've already touched upon this as in if
the payoff didn't come because the story
was too long question mark
that's because he didn't meet the actual
objective of the assignment and marks
are redacted accordingly but i think
that would have to be a whole different
thread as well
source dude just trust me
um so you're actually
this this is
pure insanity to me
so you are going to not you didn't put a
cap on the story
on the length or anything like that the
student went over the top wrote a
novella you're not only
going to not give them a good mark
despite their ambition because like
you still haven't [ __ ] great okay
this is not the booker prize
it doesn't matter you know is it you're
not giving them you know a a 50 000
scholarship that could have gone to
somebody else that deserved it on merit
it's [ __ ] it's 11th grade it's
daycare you know get over it um
regardless
not only are you not going to give them
like a good score you're actually gonna
not read the whole thing
but you're gonna come up in your head
with a reason to mark them lower and be
like i didn't read the whole thing
because of the fact that this is not a
short story so i'm not going to do the
work and then also
i'm going to be like you almost tried to
make me do more work so you're going to
get like a b minus or something like
that that's come on that's too much
you're not like the editor of
you know the new england journal of
medicine
just give them an a
and move on
does it oh and then next time you can't
be like
you didn't give me a page limit um
or i i didn't give you a page limit but
i said short story and of course you
should know given that you were born in
[ __ ] what like 2004
you didn't know that uh the definition
of a sci-fi short story taxonomically
speaking based in the 1980s when they
were originally popularized was about 7
500 words it's too much dude you got
your you got your teaching
okay then you got to commute home
then you got to cook dinner then you
gotta clean up after dinner you gotta
hey honey how was your work day maybe
you got your own kids to worry about
maybe you got other tasks and errands
that are going on oh you got people in
your family that are dealing with stuff
you got you know money situations to
sort out you want to watch the new
episode of scandal all of a sudden
instead your base your your whole life
is now structured around finding a good
reason to not read this and then give
the kid like a b as a result
i think fundamentally no matter what the
student dramatically failed at time
management the work is unedited which
means it probably does have a lot of the
flaws in there this is roughly analogous
to spending all your time doing research
for a paper and then turning in a rough
draft for your final grade you haven't
even read the paper
it's probably bad just read a chapter
and then give them a c
how can you do this
and they they sound like they have like
some basis in science and yet they're
like i haven't seen any evidence but
here's the conclusion that i'm going to
draw from this
my my professor my phd supervisor would
not let me get away with this let me
tell you
yeah in 11th grade i was smoking glue
sticks on the back of the bus but this
would not fly in my phd program
and he was sorry i went a little too far
sorry sorry
the only thing with this though is that
taking off points for something the
student was proud of could discourage
them immensely maybe op
should just write a note saying it was
great but then take the word count down
a bit i've seen a lot where a teacher
reacted like this and it could take a
toll on the students efforts by a lot
good
good comment
i see where you're coming from though i
wonder if it's a bit babying for a year
11. that means the students are 17 18. i
think the right way to would be to leave
a note explicitly explaining it was a
good novella and i enjoyed reading it
even if i didn't just because i don't
like sci-fi but that marx had to be
subtracted because it's a novella and
not a short story
do they have to be
though who are you the the short story
police
do you oh it's only a short story if
it's written in bang or maine by stephen
king on a 72-hour coke binge
otherwise it's just sparkling words
i just don't understand the
overcommitment
to the name it just doesn't make sense
to me
guess this you won't be the [ __ ]
for not reading the story but you will
be the [ __ ] if you give it a 100 just
because it's long the assignment was
short stories as we all know based on
the 1980s those are around 7 500 words
technically he didn't listen to the
assignment hey hey hey hey you know how
you were planning on going to i don't
know like brown or something like that
hey your gpa just got [ __ ] because
technically this is not a short story by
the way i know i didn't mention any of
that in the rubric i just said kind of
go nuts one page minimum
technically
you're gonna have to set your sights a
little bit lower
there wasn't a word count since i
couldn't know how old 11th graders are
he might be excused for not completely
keeping to it he might have just had so
much fun but a short story indeed means
the writing is tight not drawn out over
multiple pages um well actually it had a
one page minimum so if he didn't draw it
out over multiple pages he would have
gotten marks down but anyway like
just just as long as we're applying the
same standards to this child that we
should be applying to one another
even if his writing was amazing he
didn't write a short story therefore
shouldn't get 100 even if the writing
was perfect this is how you create the
joker there's no
this is how you get a kid who ends up
like writing like the next da vinci code
which i'm not saying is a good book but
it was
very very popular then they go on conan
o'brien or something like that and
they're like hey uh so you met us yeah
you wrote the first draft for this book
when you were in 11th grade you gave it
to your teacher what do your teachers
say and that it's a funny anecdote
actually conan would you believe they
actually gave me a c-plus because it was
supposed to be a short story
i wonder what that teacher is doing now
oh uh yeah they uh
smashed their tv out of their sixth
floor window
because they couldn't live with the
regret they asked reddit how they should
you know deal with kids
i agree with the person above tell the
students you didn't have time to grade
them yet because you're just human
that's that's fair all of this is fair
i just don't know why you have to find
like uh
you have to have like a
a a nuclear bomb in your pocket that's
like if your kid if your student gets
annoyed that you didn't read the whole
thing you have to be like okay well
technically it was supposed to be a
short story and you wrote a novella so
here's your b-minus like it's just
it's just crazy man
i mean to me
it just seems like the teacher was like
hey go nuts write me a story over the
long weekend
should have put a page limit on the top
of it and then didn't
and now people are like well you did
bake in that short story
you would be the [ __ ]
it seems the students enthusiastic and
as their teacher you're plainly
obligated to assess their performance
yes it's long but a lesson is a lesson
learned a lesson learned is a lesson
learned
yeah
but like
it's gonna take like like two [ __ ]
hours to read that thing
can you imagine how long it would take
you to like
read a two-hour long
novella
and then also corrected
like that's and and you know like i
don't mean to be rude
but like
also
we're all on the same page that this
probably sucks right
like it's written by a kid
i'm not saying it sucks relative to the
other student's writing
it might be the best
but compared to the kind of thing that
you would deliberately like buy from a
bookstore and read yourself it's gonna
be like you know it's gonna be garbage
with no editing or revision whatsoever
like it's gonna be
it's not gonna be a great two hours i
think
anyway
interesting
interesting but nevertheless i imagine
you ding your students for half-assing
an assignment right what difference is
it for you to half-ass the grading i
don't know maybe that one student isn't
doing 90 assignments whereas one teacher
is grading 90 assignments i'm not saying
you have to read the entire essay but
you would definitely be the [ __ ] if
you didn't
it's just no empathy whatsoever it's
just that the english language is not
like
emotions
wrapped up in words for some people it's
like it's it's
bite code you know that there's there's
a smart contract that was signed by the
teacher and all the students when the
assignment was presented
for her to not follow through
on her form of the uh her role in the
transaction is
ridiculous you know like she can't do it
it undermines the faith that we have in
the education system
anyway throw me a slash marker here
slash marker react



all right we are back with react court
it's been another week of incredible
react court content we'll go to top
posts from this week
i want to see some red flare please some
red flare
um am i the [ __ ] for getting upset at
the idea of my wife getting an apartment
to cut down on commute time to work
this is spicy i can already tell you
this is spicy
i've been supporting my family for
nearly 20 years and have a solid career
at a great job that is about 35 minutes
commute one way from our current home
you know what
not that unreasonable a 35-minute
commute
is probably maybe a i think it depends
where you live it seems somewhat average
my wife after 14 years of being a
stay-at-home mom went back to school and
earned her degree she found a position
at a prestigious job her dream job and
started work a few weeks ago i honestly
could not be happier however her job is
in the next town over and her commute is
quite long one hour and 10 minutes one
way
two hour okay
look half an hour is like the minimum
drive
handsome pants thanks for the gifted
subscriptions i will return to the hard
court at some point i promise
um
like
even a a five minute drive is half an
hour
you're you get in the car you buckle
your seatbelt that's another two or
three minutes you know your parking et
cetera et cetera
every drive is about half an hour long
even if it's five minutes an hour though
two different times per day i mean
you're actually like 12
of your day
if you're awake for 16 hours is like
commuting
that's that's a lot the 12
of your
work day five days a week or of your
work week i should say is commuting
it's enough to to i could understand
thinking of trying to come up with
another solution then
bombers thank you as well by the way for
the gifted subscriptions thank you um
yeah it's for her it's both ways one
hour 10 minutes one way two hours 20
minutes round trip admittedly this is
double my commute additionally your
position will require her to work
overtime for two months per year so in
all likelihood during these months she
will literally be driving working then
sleeping she's brought up several times
of the idea of renting an apartment
close to her work so her commute is
essentially zero and staying there all
work week see now this i know we're not
quite there
um
this is not the sort of thing i think
you can do if your commute's like an
hour
i think if your commute is like
you know
two hours
or it's in like a different
country maybe but like an hour
so you're gonna be like a married couple
like two days a week
and then
five days a week you're going to be
married to your job
that also requires you to do this
overtime i mean i'm not judging that i
guess necessarily but um
of course i hate the idea first i don't
like the idea of only seeing my wife on
the weekends there's additional burden
on me for cooking and feeding the kids
and getting them prepared for school
okay
even if they are older kids i mean like
that's pretty unfair then of course
there's the logistics of furnishing an
apartment short term and the financial
impact of of rent this this man is
cooking his kids
come on
um so tonight we had a pretty big
argument ending with me telling her it's
not happening of course now i'm in the
dog house we don't really have any way
to compromise in terms of reducing the
commute by way of moving
in an absolute perfect location she
would still have about an hour and 30
minutes round trip and mine would
increase to about the same
source
is heard like i'm just trying to imagine
this is her
job in like a pocket dimension how can
you have two points
on a
on a map
and yet you can't find anything that's
closer
that wouldn't also make you go much much
longer
would still hold on mine would increase
to about the same one hour 30
i mean i got to be honest with you
now that i'm thinking about it i'm like
moving so that you have a 45 minute
commute two times daily and she has a 45
minute commute two times daily
that seems okay
that doesn't seem that your commute gets
15 minutes longer
go 10 minutes longer hers gets half an
hour shorter
can you just say what you want to say
which is like you're going to be living
out in the middle of the wilderness but
um
can i also also uh say something
i look some people like driving some
people hate driving
i feel like if i had an hour and ten
minute commute that's long don't get me
wrong like that's enough
but that's like prime
carpool karaoke time that's prime audio
book time
you know you can listen to music that a
podcast time yeah i'm sure you get sick
of it don't get i'm preaching from the
ivory tower right like i'm i work from
home
it's very convenient
i feel like the thing that sucks about
the commute is that you have to wake up
in time to be able to spend an hour in
your car and then be at work on time
the actual act of driving is not that
bad i suppose
and the other i mean also like the time
of being in the car is not so bad at
least for some people myself included
um but then like finishing work at five
getting home at 6 30
starting to cook dinner probably is not
going to be ready until like 7 7 30
you know you do you eat you do the
dishes it's 8 8 30
you take a shower watch survivor go to
bed that's very relatable
still anyway i mean we've already looked
at all the relevant information
i mean i don't think he's an [ __ ]
i i mean like maybe i'm the [ __ ] for
the way i'm approaching this situation
to some extent but i'm like unless
there's almost like a just a balance
sheet question here to some extent right
like how much money is is this bringing
into the household and how much is the
apartment's rent gonna cost and does
that make any sense
uh at all to work for 40 hours a week
when you know 15 hours of it is going to
pay for a secondary uh place to live
that is non-essential
foreign panda bear thank you as well
thank you
um
for the gifted subscriptions
i feel like there's there's like a
there's a compromise to be made here
which is you know we'll try to find a
place that is in a more amenable
situation for the commute i really don't
like the way the guy's saying there's no
way to fix this all i could do was cut
her commute in half and make mine 30
longer like that seems like that could
be actually a practical solution
um
but i don't know let's see this i'm kind
of like in an info position here but i
don't think he's the [ __ ]
for
being like i don't want to just be a
part-time husband like i think that
makes sense
maybe this is her way of finally having
a break from cooking after i suspect
being the only one cooking and feeding
the kids for 14 years
source
dude just trust me
i suspect yeah
i wonder if there's an element of this
where she's pushing him to contribute
more to the household chores i wonder if
despite her change of circumstances he
still expects her to also be a full-time
housewife and this is her way of backing
out of it what the hell are you talking
about man
i suspect source dude just try this is
what the internet is like and it's
probably been like this forever
but
like i feel like in the last five years
especially it's like people will like
tell a story and then they'll be like oh
i miss the part where like you you know
are you abused your spouse either
physically or emotionally i can read
between the lines come on think about it
for two seconds like this is crazy
maybe it's her way of cheating doing
heroin and her abandoning her kids if
you're going to assume or suspect things
that nobody said let's go crazy with it
that's so good find some people with
some sanity
yeah maybe he clubs baby seals too one
of his major objections he cites is that
he would now have to cook and help the
kids go to school he should be
anticipating doing at least half of that
work anyway it sounds an awful lot like
he does not think that's his
responsibility unless she lives
elsewhere and that would go a long way
towards explaining all of this what the
hell are you talking about it's it
there's a difference between
uh
like
i don't want to do any of this work and
i literally have to be like the only
parent doing everything five days a week
like a hundred percent on call at all
times
yet precisely he literally says all she
would have time to do is drive work and
sleep yet somehow magically thinks
she'll continue to support the entire
household's needs by herself if she
lives at home like he downplays her role
because they're getting older now but
then he whines about the possib
possibility of her being homeless and it
falling onto him to support the family
that's
he he said they're getting older now so
it's not that much work for me to take
care of the kids but he just wanted a
little bit of a break this is this is
insanity man
i'm losing my they're just making stuff
up
have you ever met a human being
like hey uh i don't want my wife to
live outside of our home
for literally 80
of the time like i would rather you know
sleep in a bed with my wife at night and
you know you know co-parent and have
quality time together oh is it because
you can't be [ __ ] to cook for the kids
and you think she should be a housewife
no matter what
no oh really because i think it is
based on my own willful
misinterpretation
not the [ __ ] but she supported your
endeavors for 14 years time for you to
be the supportive one
why do you assume o.p dreams of labor
okay great comment um
look there's
at least slightly more
uh fairness here
to some extent
but like
i don't know i kind of feel like maybe
i'm just a fiscal [ __ ] to some extent
where i'm like
you know if her dream is to
have a second apartment
uh so that she can
work at her job without having to drive
like extra time every single day
maybe like this a dream where you gotta
we could compromise on that dream a
little bit
i mean i i it's just it's just strange
to me that
like i didn't here's the thing okay i
guess this again i'm i'm wary that this
could make me an [ __ ] but i didn't
realize like when op was going to work
for 14 years and like knocking out the
rent and you know climbing the corporate
ladder that was him doing his dream i
kind of thought that was him like
fulfilling his responsibility as a
spouse and a father to be the bread
winner well you know i'm not saying the
mom had a break while she was staying at
home but he served the role that he had
fallen into for himself and she was
doing the stay at home raise the kids
uh you know handle the household stuff
i'm not saying that's the way it should
be
i'm just saying like was she putting her
life to the side so that he could work
as an assistant manager at hertz
we we need more information about the
situation
like if he was
climbing if he was touring with coldplay
or something like that and now she's
like i want to do my own thing i get it
but if he was
if my man was just like eating it every
day and like driving a tow truck or
something now he's [ __ ] rolls downhill
right
anyway
to work okay look
to work can be freedom and
self-fulfillment in many ways you'll
truly understand this in your soul if
you were ever a stay-at-home mom hey now
that like this is
i've said this to kate and i have said
this
about the situation that you know kaiden
i have with the baby as well to other
people
i
get the easy job
sincerely
by being able to work partly because
my job is streaming um we'll see how
this comment goes by the way before we
agree 100
but like it's
more draining
to look after a one-year-old baby for
seven hours than it is to stream for
seven hours that might not be true for
all jobs okay
but it's definitely true for what i got
going on so i have nothing but respect
for
the the stay-at-home mother the
stay-at-home father like it's it's a lot
of work
and it it it's not like labor is the
extent like your muscles are burning at
the end of the day but you're like
psychologically drained is your only
company is
somebody that is like completely
helpless and going like
gaga right so like i totally i feel way
more drained after spending three hours
with a baby than i do
you know after spending three hours with
chat so i'm not insulting the the work
at all
i can understand that but let's see
what's going on next
because everyone's saying insane comment
insane comment
i've worked and i've been a stay-at-home
mom
and the worst most depressing suicidal
and trapped was the first five whole
years of my kid's life when i was
literally stuck at home
no adult conversations a huge gap in my
resume that places me at the same level
as a 19 year old in the job market no
personal or professional accomplishments
to show for it i can i can understand
that honestly
i know reddit loves the anti-work
sentiment but most of y'all are male
kids
look they're not wrong but probably
you didn't have to say it you have no
idea what not working does to a person
being a mom is [ __ ] and you're
essentially useless once your kids
become independent okay that's just
insanity let's go a little too far
she didn't support his endeavors but she
did her being at home saved daycare and
her husband gets a lovely pay and a
resume that actually means something i
can imagine you're thinking the poor
husband is the real loser because he had
to go to work you don't get that he had
the privilege to work all you had to do
is throw away your job and commit to
being a chef poop cleaner chauffeur made
nanny nurse and more 24 7 to know what
it means do it i dare you look okay
this was harder on her than it was on
i was expecting
um
the
i hate to sell out the other parents
okay
some of this is fair okay
chef
okay i guess it can be kind of annoying
this is the one that gets me poop
cleaner just get over it's not that bad
i do
i
willfully
just genuinely whenever i get the
opportunity
i have like five extra minutes and i see
that the baby's diaper is soiled
i am like hey kate let me change the
baby's diaper because it's such an easy
thing to do
that also
does something nice for the person who's
been looking after the baby
it's like you you do the easy job the
hard job is the
malaise that comes from like hours and
hours and hours of like looking after a
baby the actual task itself is is not
that bad like i'm not giving sympathy
for that chauffeur okay
maid nanny nurse and more 24 7.
look
this is
i don't want to
look you're not being a nurse 24 7.
you're not being a a chauffeur 24 this
is probably like 20 minutes every other
day
you know this is like
for very scary periods of hours once
every six months like i it wears on you
but you don't have to like lie
to the poor people out here
she supported their shared household in
one way while he supported it in another
i
yes i agree with this and her
contribution involved being a maid and
everything else i mentioned above i'm
laughing at her wanting to get another
apartment she can finally be free a
little
just this lady hates her husband uh and
kids
i'm not saying because and i've talked
about this before as well
i hate when
i mean there's two aspects of this right
like one aspect of this is i i hate when
parents are like oh my dang kid so
annoying i can't do anything blah blah
blah
but i also hate when people are like you
know oh it's not poop it's a beautiful
digestion miracle i
i'm so fulfilled with every second that
i spend with my kids and like no matter
what it's always like such an amazing
time i'm like come on
there's some times where you're like i
just want like five [ __ ] seconds of
like
i want to talk to an adult human being
about something that isn't like yeah
that's a giraffe you know like you get
over it you go through fits and spurts
there's a balance of like burnout and
sometimes you're just like i really just
need to brush my teeth but it's been
hours i can't brush my teeth
um
you you miss like parts of the you know
you miss the time that you have to look
after your own needs first okay
at times so there's a good in a and a
there's a good and a bad to it but when
someone is like you know i mean i just
feel bad for like what this lady is
saying is basically like hey
yeah you went to work for 14 years um
you know full time
probably busting your ass that's cool
and all but honestly like [ __ ] you for
being selfish now it's my time i'm gonna
get my own apartment and finally be free
a little bit you had all that freedom
working that budget rent a car
you got 45 minutes of lunch time a day
where you could eat a sandwich out of a
ziploc bag next to like six people you
hate
you know like now it's my time now it's
my time to finally live like my carrie
bradshaw life
budget has unpaid lunches well you know
don't care didn't ask plus you got to go
to the office
anyway that's i just i think this is
unfair okay
okay sure
whoa bazinga
how was your and your wife's child care
arranged arraignment
oh my god for the last 14 years how
about household chores was it 50 50 was
stay-at-home parenting something she
really wanted did she have to sacrifice
her career education for the two why are
you using two question marks here's a
question for you mission ad6674 why are
using two question marks in uh every
single statement it makes it sound like
you're arguing from a bad faith position
where you've already made up your mind
and aren't actually asking for
information but instead ask asking very
specific leading questions in order to
paint the op into a corner and look as
bad as possible to fulfill your inherent
biases did she have to sacrifice her
career did your wife have external help
to look after the kids and the home
while you work like a like an [ __ ]
did she have time me time or breaks
my word
everybody sucks here my boyfriend and i
were in a very similar situation last
year he got an amazing promotion in a
location one hour 15 minutes away i
insisted he gets a small flat or rent a
room for two reasons i want to know he's
safe if he's tired or stressed or
there's bad weather that makes driving
dangerous i prefer he comes home two
days later than not at all okay
fair enough
maybe she's german
how
this is an honest question how
why is this german capitalization
i i'm unfamiliar they capitalize all
nouns
i didn't know that
every noun is capitalized in german
i had no idea i i genuinely did not know
t-t-i-l look at that
they're sick and twisted
you know it's just
i had no idea quite frankly anyway
i i thought this was like an autocorrect
situation like she was typing on her
phone and she always starts sentences
with promotion so it was saved in her
predictive text with a capital p or
something
like she was always texting her
boyfriend promotion today question mark
but maybe not um the mental impact
knowing he can skip the commute if he
wants to not be forced to drive when
he's already worn out that being said we
do not have kids okay don't care didn't
ask then
and
you know you got no idea what it's like
being a nurse nanny poop cleaner clown
iron man captain america the hulk wonder
woman uh black widow
gordon ramsay marco pierre white ember
lagasse every single day 24 7.
i think your wife is selfish for wanting
to stay the whole week as a default and
i completely understand your point and i
think you're right but i think you
should consider getting her a little
place to stay for difficult days or the
two heavy months you mentioned hey you
know what i can actually find
some common ground here okay
when she has to work the overtime her
having a short-term accommodation for
two months
makes a lot of sense so she's not
literally
basically losing
her whole life except for working and
driving during that period
like a yeah like a like a two-month
airbnb or something like that you know
or it may be a hotel where it's not
unreasonable to to stay for two months
but
to like have an apartment
long term
like ad infinitum just seems crazy to me
like isn't that gonna destroy your
budget i just don't understand
i guess it depends where you live maybe
you live in a place where the you know
salaries are are
very high and rent is very cheap i don't
think that happens too much but maybe
maybe i'm i'm too vancouver pill
where i'm like people are living like
eight people to like a two-bedroom house
or something like that you know
anyway i mean the way i i'm just
surprised
i mean this is pretty much where i'm at
right oh we're getting dan rated is that
what that is we're getting
i was wondering what the pluses and
minuses were
it wasn't one guy there was like two
guys okay
i i thought they were uh
i thought they were
trying to explain how the
places could have been
uh aligned in order to make the commute
not so weird
you know
i'm just surprised how many people are
lighting this guy up that's the thing
i'm surprised nobody is like you know i
can understand why you wouldn't want to
be a part-time husband yeah okay here we
go
why is everyone in the threat assuming
that she's being forced into being a
stay-at-home mom okay well i might even
if you're right i might have left that
question alone because
that one's not gonna
it's not gonna create a lot of sympathy
for you but he why is everyone assuming
he doesn't help with the housework thank
you why is that everyone assuming that
you can afford to just move to a new
house
or have an apartment and a house at the
same time
tell me you're still in high school
without telling me you're still in high
school let's go owned based and upvoted
okay i mean sure that
not the here we go reasonable not the
[ __ ] this is a difficult position
but she does have a responsibility to be
part of the family not only would it be
damaging to the kids to rarely see their
mom but it's an unjust burden on you
since you both have full-time jobs a
compromise could be heard getting a
hotel room a couple times a month when
she's working late or negotiating a
couple work from home days that make
based and lives in the real world pill
it's my alts
i'm just i'm you know i guess the it's
the the [ __ ] rises to the top man
you know the cream's supposed to rise to
the top
but the the the top comment was
literally like
don't care didn't ask plus you're like a
misogynist
it's crazy man
there i think there's more not the
[ __ ] here going on here it's just
that the the
people latched on to the you're the
[ __ ] that are at the top
it's crazy man
like we had some some spicy messages
right off the right off the jump there
okay anyway hopefully there's some that
are more fun
am i the [ __ ] for using my husband's
name to get a table and a free meal at a
restaurant for my sister's birthday
um
who knows
okay well now i have more context so i'm
technically still married
but we aren't together anymore only our
families and a few close friends know
about the arrangement we have
for my sister's birthday we really want
to go to this restaurant the thing is
it's very hard near impossible to get a
table even with a few months notice and
we only had two weeks her husband called
originally and had no luck my sister was
super disappointed so me and her husband
promised both to keep trying the first
day i called i had no luck the second
day was the same but i asked him if i
could take he asked if he could take my
name and number
no i asked him if he could take my name
and number he was reluctant but after i
told him my last name he completely
changed now my husband used to take me
to this restaurant a lot and i know his
dad is friends with the owner
but i wasn't expecting any special
favors or anything yet after i told him
my name and he asked me if i was related
to my father-in-law he magically had a
table available for the exact date and
time i wanted it the owner was also
there the night we went and he refused
to let us pay for the meal because i was
my husband's wife
a few days after my sister's birthday my
husband calls me he never calls me
unless it's important so i answered he
wasn't happy i used his name to get into
the restaurant especially since i never
told him beforehand
uh-oh
and accuse me of enjoying the perks of
being married to him without wanting to
do my wifely duties he said if i was
going to do this again he would have to
reconsider our separation am i the
[ __ ] this is some like 50 shades of
gray
stuff right
what i mean
i think everybody's assuming the worst
and they might be right about wifely
duties um what do you mean he's gonna
reconsider the separation
what are you what's he gonna do hey you
could do you keep using my name to get
dinner reservations i'm gonna move back
in
that's a threat i guess it would
like
go through with a legal divorce but
honestly it sounds
like you know
i mean i'm just saying
the legal precedent is it tends to be
worse for the guy
than the than for the the wife so
it i don't know it just kind of seems
like i don't know what the rest of the
arrangement is okay that's all
it is seinfeld
you're breaking up with our breakup
i'm sorry this
just isn't working anymore
anyway um
i like
so here's here's something i would say
okay
i don't really think she's an [ __ ]
for
saying her real name
to the mater d
and then having them
i
mean i guess they were like are you
related to the father-in-law
yeah she is that's her father-in-law
and also like you're the maitre d
like what like oh are you related to the
father-in-law uh i'm legally obligated
to let you know that i [ __ ] hate his
son and we're still legally married by
the way have i told you about our
arrangement like
you know it sounds like they
i mean this is like is the rich people
code right this is skull and bones
you know it's like oh you're a gaff
again well yes we do it turns out our
finest table is actually available for
the price of on the house like this is
when you deal
with winks and
nudges and and secret handshakes and and
stuff like that
occasionally you're going to end up with
a miscommunication i think
but you did the secret wink i do you
know i just had some dust in my eye
also there's like another part of me
that's kind of like um
go for it you know
i mean i kind of feel like she
she owned them
that's i guess and not in a bad way
the restaurant was like you're too poor
to go here get in get in the gen pop oh
we don't have space for you oh is it
okay if you stand and you have to be out
in 20 minutes
then she was like oh you know i'm a bush
and then they were like oh right this
way to the gilded table and then she
even got the meal for free so honestly i
think if anything
she didn't do really anything wrong
except maybe make a lie by a mission the
restaurant took it and ran with it
who cares
big whoop right
i don't think it's that big of a deal
uh and honestly this is for me this is
like i don't care didn't ask you're not
the [ __ ] plus your your husband
sounds [ __ ] weird
your husband sounds like he needs to
have a pacifier in his mouth to climax
during intercourse don't care didn't ask
you own the restaurant congratulations
you're plus your husband's a weirdo
let me i get that is everybody's of
course there's going to be some level of
everybody sucks because she stole from
the restaurant you don't understand what
it's like in the but you know
i i'm i'm willing to give this the based
veto quite frankly
i'm going to give you and everybody
sucks here rather than a you're the
[ __ ] just because of the wifey duties
comment something tells me that's
probably why she uh
put that in there
does it that that comment it's a very
interesting thing because it doesn't
change
the situation that happened
but to the lay person the layperson goes
like
well you did the wrong thing but then he
was an [ __ ] to you so as a result the
thing that you did wasn't that bad
as a based nl viewer myself i'm like
that see that's not relevant to the
situation plus she didn't do anything
wrong imo
still you were definitely an [ __ ]
when you let the restaurant think you
were still married you took a comp meal
out of the restaurant's pockets and put
your ex or his father in an awkward
position when the owner talked to him
and found out
honestly
i'm still like owned
i do based on what it said it never
seemed like
maybe she let this out by omission in
the post okay but she did not
like go oh i'm gonna go home to my
husband it did did they not say oh hold
on
like
just give it a sec
the owner was also there and he refused
to let us pay for the meal
it seems like i i mean you never know
what happened
in the actual situation but like it
seems like she was like you know no
that's fine and they're like no
i would never let my
friend's son's wife pay for a meal here
and plus the goal she did was use her
i don't know it's this is just weird man
it is it's a rich people problem yes no
question there
um
okay
i don't know what people expect from am
i the [ __ ] they they like the only
way someone would be like not an [ __ ]
is if it's like uh you know oh somebody
i i accidentally cut someone off in
traffic and they shot up my car with an
ar-15 am i the [ __ ] people are like
no you shouldn't have cut them off but
at the same time you shouldn't shoot
someone's car with an ar-15
you know it's if there's any nugget of
like
possible
uh
misunderstanding it's like everybody
sucks here you you shouldn't have done
that bad thing you know even if he did
hit you with a comically oversized
hammer on your head afterwards causing
your eyes to springs came out of them
and shot them out of your head and you
got crumpled into uh a position that was
like 1 8 of your normal size
not the [ __ ] if it's your last name
you're still married to him you didn't
lie you shouldn't have done the free
meal thing well yeah
but that's more like a we shouldn't have
done that
it's not like you shouldn't have done
that this seems fine
not the [ __ ] you gave him your name
they asked if you were related you
answered truthfully
yeah you did nothing wrong and what does
that even mean reconsider your
separation
if he has a prenup that may leave her in
an uncomfortable position okay i guess
that makes sense
but the husband's still like a total
[ __ ]
it's just weird man this
you can't threaten somebody like that
what are you trying to keep her on the
payroll just so she doesn't
use your name to get into the corner
table at dorsia
info
okay sure
not the [ __ ] you used your name yeah
yeah okay you know what most of the
comments are like
not the [ __ ] i i i'm back on reddit's
side temporarily
most people were on the same level here
uh oh
this you got a scan let's skip the one
about the drug addict let's that's they
don't cover that on seinfeld how about
this one am i the [ __ ] for coming
into work just on time
i work as a security guard i was
scheduled to start working at this new
store today starting from 10 a.m which
is when the store opens
i get there at exactly 10 am asked to
place my belongings in the back room i
was in the room for a few minutes max
and then came back out to man the door
which in that time i guess many
customers had already come in and one of
the sales staff had to play security
on my lunch break the manager approached
me and asked next time if i could come a
little bit earlier next time so that by
the time i put my belongings down i can
be front of the store at 10 am i told
her no that if i'm rostered to start at
10 am then i will show up at 10 a.m and
that if they want me to come earlier
they'd have to arrange that with the
security company i'm not getting paid to
come earlier then the store would have
to arrange that oh sorry i can't read so
i really don't see why i'm required to
she got huffy with me and said the sales
staff aren't trained to be security
and with the popularity of the store
there will be people lining up waiting
to go inside
i need to be here earlier because of
that she said it really wasn't that hard
to come a few minutes earlier and then
it wasn't fair to come just on time i
know it's not hard to come a little
earlier but i feel it's more about the
principle if you want someone to come
earlier then make that clear through the
hours i told her such and she just
sighed
and walked away we didn't talk for the
rest of the day so am i the [ __ ] for
coming into work just on time
this is uh there's there's a rare
confluence of
you're the [ __ ] butt-based
you know this is like when you insult
somebody who shouldn't
uh like they shouldn't have said
something but you came back with
something that was such an order of
magnitude higher that you are
the [ __ ] just by definition right um
i
look if your boss asks you to come into
work an hour early unpaid that's not
cool if he asks you coming to work half
an hour early
unpaid that's not cool i could totally
understand your position
if you got to come into work literally
like
like three minutes early
to put your stuff in the locker so
you're ready to start your job at
10 a.m like
that's pretty standard
like you it's not like you show up at 10
and then if you got to take a dump
like you're take you know you're you're
in the clear
you gotta
be ready for the job to start
when the shift starts you don't show up
when it starts and then you're ready
whenever you're ready
this 50 cents in wages
look
we all gotta
work together here okay okay is there
there's a lot of wage theft
there's a lot of exploitation
showing up to work
three minutes early so you got time to
put your stuff in the locker so you can
be ready for your job
that's pretty normal
that i mean that's pretty normal in my
opinion
i mean people are like that's that's 18
hours of free labor a year
is it for one let me let me run that you
know let's say you work
for a round number let's say you work 50
weeks a year
five minutes so you're getting there
about a half an hour early
per week it's two hours a month times 12
months okay yeah you're in there
can i run something else by you that's
not going to be popular
a lot
there's maybe you would consider that
unpaid labor
there's also going to be a lot of time
at any job but maybe particularly at
this job that's paid on labor you know
what i mean
i'm not saying that
i mean i think that's a good thing
i i don't think that you should have to
audit like well he's not actually
working as hard as he could in this time
so he will pay him a little bit less i'm
just saying
you know the three minutes that you're
there you shove your stuff in the locker
it's also going to be probably like a
half hour where he's standing at the
door when he's just in his own head you
know what i mean
that's paid on labor
anyway like look again i i think i'm
being
painted unfairly with the the the brush
by the r slash anti-workers right
you just show up
literally five minutes early you put
your stuff in the locker you go to work
and then you do what everybody else does
when you gotta take a dumpy
you extended an extra
two three minutes and now you're even
you take little psychological
breaks when you know your boss isn't
really paying attention to get you
through the day
anyway
i'm also like uh
there's a part of me that's like uh
how can you even show up
at the same time
i feel like there's five minutes of
tolerance plus or minus
when it comes to arriving in the first
place
i mean maybe this is just you know
because i historically it's changed
lately but historically i'm like an
early person i was literally never even
like a minute late for work because in
my head i was like well in order to
ensure that i'm there on time
essentially
if anything happens on the commute
except for like you know the city having
a
10.0 earthquake or something like that
um i have to leave with enough of a
window surrounding me that most of the
time i'm gonna show up five minutes
early anyway
anytime i showed up like exactly on time
it was because there was like a little
extra traffic and that's why you built
it into the commute estimate to begin
with
i'm not saying five minutes early is on
time i'm not trying to get argue from
that boomer position
i'm merely suggesting that if you want
to be exactly there at 10 a.m every day
you know that means you kind of got to
leave like expecting to be there at 9 55
but
you know if one of the pedestrian
crosswalks has a hand up instead of
a walk symbol then you're still gonna be
there on time
anyway i'm
look
the other thing that i've been hiding
from you is that
i'm a part of the
severe plurality here for sure
like for the the people that are like
this is the worker exploitation hey you
might be right but
you know
you're gonna have to find a different
website that to get enough people to
agree with you i think probably some
discord communities imo but anyway um
look again i think there's a if they
wanted you to be 15 minutes early every
day
um
unpaid that would suck
i i think that would be borderline like
you know maybe have a conversation about
it um but like if they want you to be
there in time to put your stuff in the
locker and then stand at the front door
by 10 a.m like
come on man like you gotta
you gotta meet him like halfway there
at every job i've had if you're
scheduled to start work at 10 a.m that
means you well it means you get there or
you you had 10 at the dot or on the
floor available to work if you're in the
back putting away your belongings you
aren't working okay look they they said
what i'm not confident to say
but agree with you're the [ __ ] the
start time is when you're expected to
work not walking in the door
you're the [ __ ]
you do need to be paid for the hours you
work you need to be your assign station
and ready to work at the starting time
this i mean
if your shift starts at 10 you start to
work at 10
you can't be there at point 10 and take
your time to make some coffee etc if it
takes you five minutes come earlier so
you can start your work when your shift
starts
info needed what are the items and what
are you putting away
oh man is there any op comments here
not the [ __ ] screw jobs that nickel
and dime for less than five minutes if
they want you there at 10 they should
schedule it that way unpopular but i
truly do not care don't expect your job
to be happy about it though especially
since they already pulled you aside to
talk about it pick your battle i mean
honestly i don't disagree with this
either
like
i would like to think that
if i were the manager
and maintain my current disposition
i would be like you know five minutes is
not a big deal i'm happy to stand at the
door or whatever um i like it's such a
minor thing to generate conflict for
on both sides to some extent but it also
does sound like places you know busy and
crowded at 10 a.m i can understand why
they would want to have like a security
uh guard that's active even for that
five minutes um
so i i i do i mean i don't disagree
hugely i mostly i'm like when people are
like you should take your boss to the
like the ministry of labor because this
is illegal wage theft that's where i'm
like come on man
that's you know
some days i have some gastrointestinal
distress maybe i need 17 minutes for my
bathroom break uh after four hours i'll
eat my sandwich on the john
you don't nickle and die me for those
two minutes and sure i'll be happy to
you know start two minutes early or
something like that
it happened you know we've all got to
get along here
i guess i don't know here's a they
could you
they look can i
they probably have him scheduled 10 a.m
to like 5 p.m just because it's a
seven to eight hour
times the hourly wage that's like easy
to calculate um
i mean i if if you could just add five
minutes to the payroll i think that
should be totally fine as well
if if they can do that sure why not
that being said i'm just
maybe this makes me like a total [ __ ]
i don't think i would want to work with
this guy and maybe that makes me
a a
corpo okay
i'm just like even as like a co-worker i
think like if if it was day one and like
he came in and was like well actually
like i'm scheduled to be here at ten so
like if you i would be like i don't
wanna work with this guy this seems he
seems annoying like this just seems
annoying as hell
like if you wanna do this [ __ ] go to law
school okay this is old navy
like we're just trying to we're taking a
year off from senior year
trying to make a little bit of money
have a cool spring break figure out what
i want to do with my life
like you know
go to law school fight the good fight
there don't i mean i guess he's he's on
the ground doing it but
i'm just saying
i'm not i'm not saying he shouldn't be
saying i'm just saying i i personally
think i would find him a little annoying
anyway
i mean i think pretty much everyone here
was like pretty reasonable
i'm sure if you go to controversial
there's going to be like lots of
interesting ones
holy bursh
i'll tell you what
this person does not show up for work on
time
it was painful how far down i had to
scroll to find someone who wasn't
declaring that you should be donating
free time to employers bro look
[ __ ]
sorry
look okay it's
it's three minutes okay i'm sorry like i
i know that that
flies in the face of distilling
everything down to its most broad
principles
but it's three
it's this it's literally this the same
as the the pizza one where the guy
borrowed two dollars
from his sister and then his sister was
like you've betrayed my trust even
though like you pay me back immediately
it's like
you're not wrong in principle
but
it's three minutes it's two dollars your
family maybe not at old navy but
if it's if it's only three minutes why
can't they just pay him for three extra
minutes no i agree i'm just saying like
it's only three minutes then
you know is it really worth fighting
over obviously some people have drawn up
the battle lines don't get me wrong i'm
just saying
it's 200 in wage theft all right i mean
i guess sure
i don't know and you know what from
having to work with this guy i'm going
to need a counseling session once every
two weeks so like 150 bucks a session
so you know i'm the i'm glad we we
ironed out this 200 in wage theft and
i'll pay four grand out of pocket to
just gripe about the situation at my
toxic workplace
instead
just schedule him for like 9 45 can we
like or fire him and hire somebody who's
not going to complain okay those are the
just hey this situation cannot stand one
way or the other okay
we gotta figure in the real world you
have to make some compromises at some
point okay this this is seinfeld though
for sure
oh man is it hold on was that a okay it
was a it was a throwaway account i gotta
know man
i i honestly feel like this i meet
people a little throughout my life i
have met people that uh
they live in the literal
and
it is where you end up with the the
walter situation right from the big
lebowski which is like you're not wrong
but like
come on man i'm just trying to like
knock out the damn rent
i get it but
yeah
am i the [ __ ] for not
telling girlfriend i had a son from a
prior relationship i can't imagine
how this could not be
um
you're the [ __ ]
and it seems like that's how it bears
out but like
there's no context at all in two
paragraphs that could save you i became
a dad at 17 to make things worse let me
stop you right there
not the way you should be writing about
your relationship with your child in
public
to make things worse my girlfriend at
the time my son's mom was plucked from
doing anything
her mom just said she's done they
stopped any and all communication and
walked away i moved on i'm hoping she
moved on i don't know what this means
they took the
their they took the daughter
they took the sun and
left with no communication
he or he got left with the child
i don't know
i'm 22 23 here soon
about um so this is 17 man that's
ancient history geez that was like why
are we talking about stuff that happened
in 2016 man like
come on we're living in the 2020s now
you know why you dredging up all this
ancient history
about a month or so ago i met this
amazing fun sweet beautiful girl a few
nights ago we went on our third date
feeling poorly that i'd hid a huge part
of my life from her to start i told her
i had a son she at the time was like
chill she wanted to go to my place and
meet him so he did that i woke him up
told him someone wanted to meet i woke
him up
that's so
whoa woke up my
my six-year-old son was sleeping
yeah
hey this is
it was getting pretty serious we're on
our third date look i'm not it's it's
not that bad it's just kind of funny
i would be are you crazy you just meet
an afternoon on like a sunday or
something like that
okay
told him someone wanted to meet him they
hung out for half an hour or so oh come
on man it's a school night when we were
alone she let it be known that she feels
as though she was played in a way that i
should have told her on date number one
i had a son
yeah um
yeah
it's kind of like a soft you're the
[ __ ] like
i don't know man like uh
i never went through this
did people in chat are saying three
dates is pretty okay
really you don't do it like if you had
like an hour and a half long first date
you couldn't find a time to be like
when they were like what's your life
like you're like by the way i live with
a five-year-old kid that's my own
i feel like it's that's a pretty huge
thing to bring up and it's not like i
mean he felt remorse and then he brought
it up in a fairly reasonable time frame
but yeah i think it kind of is like
it's a little bit of a you're the
[ __ ]
doesn't mean you did an [ __ ] thing
that doesn't mean you're irredeemable
you're the [ __ ] yeah i mean i'm glad
other people got to this one you're the
[ __ ] you don't wake your kid up in
the night to meet a girlfriend much less
one you've dated for a couple weeks i
definitely
agree with that as well
the the the wake up part is like and
this happens on
on am i the [ __ ] on occasion people
are like you know
they write a story that's like am i the
[ __ ] for not letting my date steal
breadsticks from the buffet and then
like in the middle of the post it's like
you know
so i told her she'd never amount to
anything and am i the [ __ ] for not
letting her take the breadsticks and
people are like no but
you know for telling her she'll never be
a good writer because she doesn't have a
curious mind that makes you a little bit
of an [ __ ] you kind of shove that
part in the middle
you're the [ __ ] firstly be honest
from day one secondly don't wake your
kid up in the middle of the night
lastly don't let your kid meet someone
you've only been dating for a few weeks
or most
counterpoint counterpoint i have no
username sorry counterpoint
amazing fun sweet beautiful girl you
ever consider that
i just
like i have some anxiety i think it
comes
like clear and and it comes across in
like the way that i talk about social
interactions and you know like my
experiences at the deli counter in the
grocery store i'm constantly like making
sure i'm not getting in anybody's way
and and oh if this person comes here
they're going to want some space so i'm
going to move over to the side and and
when i'm walking on the sidewalk i'm
looking behind me to make sure everybody
can like get like i i over analyze the
state of the environment that i'm in but
reddit just
i read some of these comments and i'm
like it must just be so exhausting to
like live
like you're
pretending to live or maybe this is how
you're really living like yes the only
time i would wake my kids up in the
middle of the night if is if there was a
fire they need their sleep
okay yes
but it's half an hour
one night like it's not
like he's
the kid's sleeping in the bed and like
once every you know three days he just
like throws a bucket of ice water on his
face or something like that like it's
just a one-time
mistake like oh did this you child
services should go take put them in the
foster system now right like
op needs to get a lot more serious with
their child's mental health
like
you
no
like
like kind of like again it's like you
know it's like you know
oh normally we eat at six i was really
stressed out i lost track of time i
ended up making dinner for my kid at
seven instead of six people would like
read that and write kid as growing
children need regularity and youth
starving them is not helping them you
need to get your own things together
before you even become uh it's crazy man
like it just happens something [ __ ]
happens
you shouldn't have woken up the kid for
half an hour right that's hilarious but
also wrong but come on needs to get a
lot more serious with their child's
mental health
i mean who's talking
that's just it's one night man
i agree kids need sleep it's just anyway
you're the [ __ ] for awake yes okay
yes yes
of course yes
you're the [ __ ] for introducing your
child to a casual date
kids shouldn't meet dates until you're
as good as engaged honestly i don't know
if that's true it might be true um
most of my experience with this kind of
stuff is like robin williams movies from
the mid 1990s or you know stepmom
starring julia roberts like i don't
really know when this is supposed to
when the introduction is supposed to
happen so that that might be true for
all i know
but everything i know about this
situation i learned from mrs doubtfire
very soft you're the [ __ ] hey a sane
human being
that's something you should tell someone
you're dating on the first date don't
get me wrong i don't mean let her meet
him or anything i 100 get protecting
your son however people have a right to
know this information some people don't
want to date someone who has a kid fair
very soft
you called him a very soft [ __ ]
this guy woke up his kid to introduce
him to a girl he has went on three dates
with this guy is a major [ __ ] for
this alone
do you ever think
that it's possible
that somehow we've slipped into
like a
a time that is like morally as
puritanical as the pilgrims
maybe maybe that's a slight exaggeration
but like the guy woke his kid up for
half an hour he was excited about his
date he's 22 23 years old
and this person has got 96 upvotes he's
a major [ __ ] for waking this kid up
he's a major [ __ ]
like what what would i consider to be a
major [ __ ]
the wrestling promoter from spider-man
one
who
uh
toby mcguire is going toe-to-toe with
bone saw he wasn't even expecting to
last more than 30 seconds anyway the ad
said
like 500
if you can stand three minutes in the
ring with bone saw
he ko'd bone saw in like a minute and a
half and then the guy goes that the ad
said for three minutes you ko'd him in a
minute and a half and then he said
that's not fair and then
the promoter said i missed the part
where that's my problem that's a major
[ __ ] okay
which is why it feels so good
when that guy gets robbed and toby just
goes
that uh
when he moves out of the way to let him
get on the elevator
and then he gets him back with his own
line i miss the part where that's my
problem yeah then it backfires on him
yeah yeah
then it backfires on toby as well
there's a lesson in there somewhere
but then uncle ben was like i missed the
part where that's my problem
toby maguire was like what's ama gonna
do uncle ben was like i missed the part
where that's my problem it's a whole it
just is like
keeps going man it's
it's [ __ ] does anybody else see how
[ __ ] this is
anyway
i'm just saying this two
major [ __ ] like we got to be nicer to
people i get the irony trust me
but like
it's that's a little mistake you
shouldn't have done and now you're like
standing with the gulag it's too much
everybody sucks here
you should have told her you had a son
and she sucks for being really
inappropriate and asking to meet your
son on the third date bro she's like 22.
i don't
you're just 22 years old i don't know
what kids are like when i'm 22. you see
the offhand comment
like hey i'd like to meet your kid one
day all of a sudden this idiot's driving
me back to his place waking up his sons
i didn't mean like right now like
jeez there is assuming she's around the
same age she probably doesn't have that
much experience with kids well i agree
it was wrong for her to ask to meet the
kid i'd have a hard time calling her an
[ __ ] there's uh
24 upvotes versus 133 does nobody else
see how absolutely [ __ ] this is
people they they think in such absolutes
man
