uh let's roll it back here but you know
we got to try to unlock the new
character okay
the way you unlock one of the new
characters you got to redacted the
redacted in their redacted
hole um but if you're not doing that
then you have to for the other character
beat lazarus without dying yeah beat
hard mode with lazarus without losing a
life
we're gonna give it a try okay
new curse of darkness just dropped and
it is uh it is mighty dangerous
the light has been real quiet since new
curse of darkness dropped
bet for the bat gods who i didn't know
that
there wasn't an escape path there um do
we do we have mods
it's a special occasion normally uh i
i don't support uh fictitious gambling
uh but nl i thought you were really into
the stock market now
[Laughter]
you don't understand risk adjusted
returns okay but like just
you know what i don't come to the
gentian impact forums and go
oh i did 17 5 star rolls and i still
don't have teresa
you know stay in your lane all right um
but today is a special occasion all
right we could get some gambling going
if we have mods around
if the mods are are willing to do it
thank you mods appreciated
much appreciated
are you doing alt path you know what you
need to be informed for the bet so i
understand the question
if the alt path is open and the run
seems good enough
i can't not try if the run is so bad
we're likely to die or hard mode doesn't
give us the consumables necessary to
access the path
then we will be taking the normal path
you know what
the moment was was foreshadowed on the
podcast
we have to how could we not take it when
when ed said they
they buffed it on the podcast this is
the specific item that
he talked about embrace chaos
greatest item doubters doubters
doubters are driving through downtown
vancouver
those are not new items seven cents for
the sack come on
begging for the location of zane through
text
you guys see that video from uh
vancouver where the guy
smashed the the kovid deniers
uh passenger side window with his bike
vancouver's been on public freakout a
lot recently
it has been like
every day there's like a 75 chance the
top post on
public freakout is from vancouver whoa
uh that's a faster shot now huh
what the what the
new steven just dropped gish has been
real quiet since new steven just dropped
okay i think we're good wait no no hold
on yeah
we're gonna take the alt path
temporarily dude honestly the first
alt path might actually be a huge
advantage because if you
step on the white fire you get an item
when you get another writer room you get
a boss you get another boss etc
etc oh was that snake eater
but for you
i think that's snake eater man halloween
this is halloween floor
dan any other game
i'll let you play your little your
little tricks okay your little
subterfuges
in isaac i'm the one who makes up the
fake names for the real things okay
if this was escaped from tarkov so to
speak
sure you want to call them invisible
marties or you know this is the marty
hall whatever
in isaac i come up with them this guy
right here
ninja spider of the aquatic variety
so shall it be ridden so shall it be
done
this is 2015 mathis when we have to
record a roundtable episode at the break
of dawn i.e 4 p.m eastern time ok that's
not very nice
i apologize
there were many days though when
he was like hey guys he was always on
time don't get me wrong but there were a
few days where he was like sorry i just
woke up
but you know what when you when you're
your own boss they let you do it
yes honey that is that is a yes honey
enemy
there's no question what the heck was
that
illuminati curveballs
i didn't see any white fire
blue fire
no fire no fire oh hold on we got to go
to our item room
you know what now oh it's in ah there's
no mirrors on the next floor of course
i was thinking maybe it was in the shop
i almost thought myself into a terrible
mistake
level of friction the coefficient of
friction much higher on this floor
i've noticed that i don't know if
anybody's talking about it i'm asking
the questions that
uh i want answered so much water on the
on the ground the coefficient of
friction is up
just curious why kick the bombs because
it
looks freaking sick is the
is the answer to your question looks
freaking cool
it's pretty wicked yeah like you would
you go to tony
hawk and be like hey tony hawk why did
you do three and a half
rotations on your skateboard when you
went up in the ramp you you know you
could just go up and then down
let's go saved and then we can get a
deal with the devil
by pressing the space bar in advance of
this uh boss fight
and it's all coming together double deal
with the devil incoming
i don't like this boss though and i
don't like i mean i find him
dangerous curse of the tower
he's right ed was right saved uh we'll
talk about that it's pretty good
so there is a synergy there's a synergy
associated with all three of these items
um it's very dangerous but also
uh very fun plus we're lazarus you know
i'm trying to unlock the new character
but
uh if you know like we gotta lean into
the zayn a little bit at least
for sure now we just need as much money
as possible
the problem is it's not a major problem
but the problem is
when we use satanic bible we guarantee
ourselves a deal with
the devil as our boss item which is
just a little dangerous
um because it makes it hard to get hp
like it's
it's a runaway uh positive feedback loop
because we won't have the hp to take the
deals with the devil which means we'll
want to use the satanic bible
so that we can get enough survivability
whether it's in the form of demon hearts
or otherwise
we need hp to live especially you know
games brand new we're going to be taking
a disproportionate amount of damage
so we might find ourselves a little
starved for hp
but you know what we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it we could
refrain from using satanic bible until
just after the boss fight and hope that
it gives us the kind of you know free
items we're looking for
but let's just think about it for a bit
scapular is pretty good too
no doubt about that um
i'm willing to and i know it's a little
it we're gonna lose damage here um but i
feel like we take this
and we take this as well and uh
then we just don't we have enough
survivability to
not use satanic bible as soon as we get
a charge
hopefully get hp from the boss and then
build off that for the future
i don't think i'm overthinking it i
think i'm thinking like exactly the
right way
there should be a mirror it's probably
the room just below there i guess oh
yeah because there's the white fire this
this could freaking come together man no
doubt about it
we don't want it okay don't use it yet
don't that's right we need two bombs
you're not wrong
i'm optimistic we can get the two bombs
no matter what like
just by going into the the minus
dimension but
might also die here don't think so
so not not a safe bet not a safe bet
love to see it okay
just use it i don't think so i don't
think it
i don't think so in the land of the bald
the one-haired man is king
oh you know what i could
well thank god we did all that for
marbles right i could just
um get hits
very interesting indeed i could just get
hit
and then curse of the tap well what am i
going to get hit by that's going to use
bombs there good point
i can't take it because i want to stay
alive in order to make uh
i don't know what that is either in
order to make the second character get
unlocked
hold on mystery medicine
it feels lucky i don't know
i don't know it's not cowardice it's uh
it's mathematics new trinkets
new trinkets just dropped
don't really want to go to the curse
room
mirror room all right so we got to go
into the minus dimension no
doubt about that that's a given
uh i'm like i hope that doesn't
extinguish the fire
uh the times will be pretty tough when
we come back there
take me into the minus realm all right
now what do we want to see in the minus
realm
uh hp ups from our item room would be
pretty sick
either that or we'll just accept we
won't be able to take every deal with
the devil but
that's that's a hard realization for me
to come to terms with
um we want to see two bombs as well
or one bomb even is fine and then we
could bomb ourselves
next to the door and curse the tower
we'll probably finish the job
truth be told it wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world to just beat hard
mode
the easy way and unlock a new character
but you know that's that's the coward's
way out
right i forgot it's not a real item room
where where okay shop is busted
but the boss is legit
keep in mind you're the lost right now
so devil deals
are free well well well
well well well well
just what we needed a little bit more of
a buff
on satanic bible
you use satanic bible you get a deal
with the devil for free
from the mirror boss and if the deal
with the devil is hp
oh man let's go
that's what we're looking for
yeah it does look better in general like
the the the game has had a lot of uh
like little graphical tweaks and uh you
know new filters and stuff like that
enemy sprites have been
uh augmented saved
there's a spicy hit no doubt about that
okay we could use two bombs but this
enemy like i know i
i shouldn't invite the comedic timing
this enemy is not that difficult to
not get hit by all you do is walk around
in a circle
and pick your moments
admittedly with the reflections i'm
feeling a little cursed right now
but this is just circle strafe 101
you know if you've ever played quake you
can beat this boss
easy money okay sulfur
even if it's free i'm not willing to
take the chance because it's not what we
want unfortunately
now does this work
already the bounty has already been
gleaned
you have backpack that is true you got
me on that one
i have nothing to offer in my own
defense
if backpack or if if sulfur would indeed
have been free we should have taken it
for sure
maybe we still can
it's good stuff okay you know what dude
no we can't check the cursor we might
die on the way out
how does the mirror realm work you can
get hit like once per room i guess
you always have holy mantle also you
just like you're
literally the lost hey what the heck it
still took my hp
i've been lied to i've you know what i i
shouldn't have let it happen i think i
got baited by a doubter
he got scammed
well jokes on the doubters because now
we have sulfur and sulfur is like
is the easiest item to win with in like
the whole game
your bombs ah
i need i was like i need the hp hold on
hold on
we can puzzle our way through this one
take me out
i'm willing to take a gamble on this i
know we could bomb ourselves and use
curse of the tower
but i'm thinking that a much shrewder
play is to
let god decide we're going to let god
decide
if you give me bombs back oh no god
decided against us
okay maybe we'll go not alt path this
time
secure the victory
secure the victory for the believers
and unlock the new character let me out
please
i mean this is not necessarily a one run
by believer standards either
i was gonna go back to the shop yeah um
because we still got a bunch of new
enemies and stuff
one of the best things about having a
high view count and an active chat
is that the kinds of comments that like
on youtube rise to the top where they
like
make a a a quotation mark that's like
you know
says he's gonna do x and then does
uh y instead it just it takes 20 minutes
to type it out and then it gets
heated up through the top of the screen
before even the fastest reader on planet
earth can
uh can uh parse what it says it's a
beautiful thing
i love it okay it makes my heart sing
take me down to the next floor oh hey
optimistical thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
give me some sulfur give me some salt
give me some salt you know that give me
some give me some salt get you guys
anybody here from mid-2000s brooklyn
indie rock scene
or alternatively pitchforkmedia.com
nope never heard of it all right
looks like you guys aren't ready for
that one but your kids are gonna love it
opinions on the national um
i mean come on you can't hate the
national but there are times where i'm
like i don't want to listen to this
music because i enjoy smiling
you know i remember this i remember this
item being
good battery pack
many batteries confirmed good although
some of those batteries oh we should
have done this in a different order but
that's okay some of those batteries were
a little
were a little weak but that's okay
goodbye money equals power you know what
it's a good point
but the thing is you know i'd rather
have hp now
and get the damage later the money's not
going anywhere we got uh
we got a not humbling bundle what's a
contract from below we got contract from
below
plus i've always been a proponent of the
idea that um
really like damage in isaac is is
overrated
the most important stat is range
if you can just get a range stat that
really like gets to the next level like
that's all that matters
range makes you op because most enemies
have finite range so they can't see you
or hit you when you're far away uh two
golden bombs
four calling birds three french hens two
turtle doves
and a one run in a pear tree okay so
we're
we got a great thing going on here i i
need to uh let tomo in tomo's beating
the door down
everybody wants a slice today okay
tomorrow
tell me oh my headphones
welcome hello now don't get down on the
courts
okay today's today's a cordless day for
the cats
today is a cordless there you go there
you go he's in
that's that's a good way of thinking
about it the most
important stat is just having fun
and being nice playing fair
show tomo no he's he's like in his box
right now i wouldn't
rip him out of his box uh just to show
him
if he's interested in being shown then
you know we'll talk about it
but dude this is a ripoff
instead of getting a deal with the devil
for free i'm getting a deal with the
devil for pay
satanic bible confirmed ruined
yeah that's not quite good enough oh but
we're free we're back on the alt path
boys let's go
[Laughter]
deal with the devil at full cost
annel i liked your edmond interview
thank you and you know it's
you know thank ed really
you know i i miss
missile man i thought you were called
miss lemon but missile man thanks for
the gifted subscriptions thank you
i uh you know you really gotta
hand it to ed on that one because i feel
like
for a lot of developers when they did
the interview or designers
they would want to be like um you know
i'm really just here to kind of like
pimp the game and
talk about like all the amazing new
stuff that's in the game and like so on
and so forth
and i was like no i don't wanna
i don't wanna be part of the marketing
machine i wanna ask you like what it
means to be a creator
and also a dad you know like and i
i was very thankful that he was like
generous with his both his time and his
thoughts when it comes to that
but i i didn't watch the other
interviews but i i saw some reaction to
them it seems like they're all really
well received
and they offered like different things
you know like some people were more
focused on like you know the
the meta conditions surrounding isaac
and some were more
focused on um like the getting into the
nitty-gritty of like what new mechanics
are gonna be and stuff like that so i'm
glad that there was uh
there was a variety there
yeah it's been on youtube for a bit it's
been maybe like a few days to spend on
youtube
at this point okay i was gonna say i'm
invincible but i
take that back i no longer feel
invincible um
we're gonna get bookworm do we want
satanic bible
instead of sulfur i don't know sulfur is
pretty good
what's going on with the monster manual
man it's literally sister maggie huh um
still not sure it had one room try out
and i'm like man i don't know about that
so stick with the i think i like our
existing setup quite frankly
uh hold on you get to keep the familiar
i have sister maggie still
it's permanent now what okay hold on let
me think about that
it only lasts for one floor okay
confirmed still not that impressed
only lasts for the floor i i sleep
what the heck is that brain worm ding
it's probably like a mix of all worms
together i guess
but it sounds like cinemasins
i want to see because if we can get it's
low chance and now like zero
but if we could get a guppy item then
i would be much more tempted to do the
uh guppy's tale but i think we're out
here
yeah i think we're good to go
brain worm is the best worm miss the key
ah last
it's uh nevertheless is too far back now
i dare not return
the journey is is we've come too far
we'll never make it
yeah we choose not to take it we're good
yeah we're good no doubt
alas poor yorick what the heck
i was i thought we were at a concert yo
the ash pit
it's invicta music bone flies
now i've seen everything
uh fruitcake caused my sulfur shot to
bounce
fruitcake works with sulfur now we're
talking
everybody wanted to eat it just so we
could hold on to sister maggie for an
extra floor
come on man come on i can't enter the oh
because you're still alive
um don't don't steal my charge
cube baby yo it's ice baby
but in a cube this is i from the panch
notes i saw
we're taking some damage if we're at
this point
were i a doubter i think i would be i
would be laughing
i would be going hahaha he's going down
but
uh it's it's up to me
you know we got satanic bible don't
don't let it slip away we got lots of
potential advantages here
i don't know what happened but i'm i'm
very for it yeah yeah yeah
exactly exactly okay here you know what
you do
i didn't see that come in come on man
come on come on
it's bone flies dude
the believers will rise again true will
never die
i like this fruitcake uh
sulfur synergy very much
it it makes me enjoy both items more
which is like my hallmark for
for whether a synergy is sick or not so
sick
and l what's your favorite toto song you
know what because like whenever i talk
about toto i just make enemies
like uh hold the line is like an okay
song
for like a not really a one-hit wonder
but you get the idea
africa is not a good song and the weezer
cover is even
more offensive to me what a kick
uh how did i miss come on little little
carrying queens
he's done it it's not as strong as i
thought it would be loving the black
holes here though
yeah i mean the weezer cover
okay um it's it's just it's the same
song
it's it's like my least favorite genre
of cover
hey the the other song is old so let's
like just
cover it and add nothing to it
just standing still man just standing
still taking damage
embarrassing
help yo the baby did us a great service
there though
um baby skull legs
baby skull x
i'm not taking a risk on this one i
don't
know i don't i don't want to play pong
i'm more of a frogger guy
good transformation good good
transformation
i don't know where to go man they keep
felt like i was playing what's that game
called
phasmagoria whether you get the swinging
axe blades
just leave man just leave is it duality
mushrooms
am i in a dream right now like what's
going on oh hello
you thought you could sneak by me
but you know the weezer thing you know
rivers is getting the last
laugh as he takes his board to work and
i'm stuck taking my stinky car
okay i know how this works
comedic timing
stand on the other side of the map you
know when you get a chance
kick those in there you never know how
they're going to work
nice shot yeah missed all the enemies
but that's okay
you sorry fool destroyed
algiers please hagelas i don't know
about that one
we are on four of six though this is
it's not looking so bad
i have no idea what our hp is like
that's that's the scary part for me
that's not helpful
imagine getting hit on the spider wave
like that's
it's just insulting how are we alive
like i deserve to be dead
well we probably will not be taking king
being conception
it's a little little much right now but
we are alive
why am i walking into the old floor
don't don't do it don't do it
take this
hold on when you die you're gonna give
me a charge
we use the charge per throw this it's
judas's shadow
we take it if we die we die we say we
don't care
we got we got stuff to do we got
unfinished business on this floor
we might not get the next character this
is how every uh
run has gone for me by the way as
lazarus i i
start by playing very conservatively and
then i'm like nah screw that
we're going all the way
[Laughter]
i put 20k on this well then get excited
because you're about to win
like a million i don't know
i don't know how it works
plus like the thing is you can't really
use your channel points for anything
anyway so
i wouldn't get too uh bent out of shape
one way or the other
come on you freaking pineapple hair
you're still alive down here
come on come on
shop but be careful when you spend your
money this time you got money equals
power
i still got to try the gift man it's
like one of the only ways we can get hp
it has to be done he's a genius
he's the smartest of all the gamers and
i will take this as well
okay now we're talking
we must have hit the other two yeah yeah
okay are we ready for this
i don't see why not
brilliant strategist i know what i'm
doing here i wish i
wish my speed were a little higher but i
know what i'm doing
we've been here before some of you
weren't here earlier in the stream and
it shows
flying seems good here yeah i guess like
if you're bad and you need help then i
could understand
that but
i'm on the other hand i'm just built
different
okay it's very simple it's all it's not
about your movement
it's about the dodging
saved
saved yet again because he's the world's
greatest gamer
isaac go go go go go
he's so good
he's so good he's so good he boomed me
the greatest dodger since pedro martinez
it is crazy that you can't use your own
consumables down here
that really puts a damper on it
like that's a tough throw
he's not free he's not free saved
that's a tough one that's not helpful
[Laughter]
we got one we got we made space we made
space okay
sneak just sneaking in there we need the
key
i see now that we need the key
what am i doing i need the key maybe
when you're holding the bomb the key
goes
this thing goes down what's happening
i need is there a switch
bomb the key to push it away dude thank
god for twitch otherwise i would be
i would just die there on youtube
without a doubt
i wouldn't it never would have crossed
my mind despite being so obvious
i would have been stuck there forever
okay a little little close
like i'm just gonna say nobody else will
say because they want to coddle you
but if you've ever died or
god forbid even taken damage on that
section you should probably just
go back to um roblox
like i don't know if i could face twitch
chat after taking damage on a room that
easy
i'd probably just i don't know man i'd
be done with games i might go back to
stuff like maybe crossword puzzles or
something
something more your speed yeah
go back to pixelmon
[Laughter]
got him
you know if you really if you're
struggling i can print out some word
searches for you
that hurt that hurt now what's our hp
like
oh it was fine why was i i was being a
baby
that being said this curse of the
darkness is gonna be a little nasty for
sure a little nasty curse
freaking sexy curse
up your gamma how about you put the
gamma up yours
actually it seems like a good idea but i
did i it's one of those things where you
get like a lot of
uh different answers from people right
like
one of the oh we shouldn't do this we
only have eight cents
one of the things that was tweeted this
morning like somebody tweeted me and
they're like
before you play repentance you should
know
do not turn up your gamma like it
something something and i'm like dude
what i haven't even
just like this is what happens you see
when you when you go
and you stay awake instead of going to
bed at a normal hour or living in the
best time zone in the world pst
you you watch too many other streams you
hit me with like these these
fringe pieces of feedback i don't even
know how to interpret like
they're like i can't tell you why but
don't do this thing
and i'm like i don't just makes me want
to do it more because
you know you're telling me i can't do
something with no reason why
but i you know they probably did adjust
the gamut down a little bit so i
i wouldn't i mean this is the way the
game is meant to be experienced the
snyder cut
it goes to 11.
all right i got to admit that's a lot
better like
much like mini hud i protested too much
and it really did change the game like
that looks so much better
i still can't see everything but
at least i can i can make out some some
vague shapes
oh i knew it was coming too that's
i'm i'm stuck don't forget you're here
forever
that sucked pretty bad uh thank you
scapular
i would say is a very high percentage
chance we're coming back as dark judas
oh this is this is the lazarus respawn
okay just give it a sec
give it a sec i mean we'd rather die and
come back as dark judas but we don't
have to do it right away
because i can't remember if you respawn
in the same room or in the next room
i don't i have no idea what's happening
at all
but we lived okay now that we've died
once
as help
uh lazarus we can no longer unlock
the boss so we should die to become
dark judas
get that sick damage upgrade
and then get as many demon hearts as as
we're allowed
imagine being like this is bad for the
uh believers are you aware of the power
of dark judas
it's not help help me
i'm gonna die okay you know
that things got a little spicy on that
room
imagine being a doubter right now that's
all i have to say
okay we're chilling check this out
not what i was looking for confirmed
i'm scared of pushing these buttons just
let work me back a sec here
rooms that are new are scary rooms that
are old
not scary just fun
we can't take taurus here speed is too
low instead we'll take bbf
which is gonna get us killed
hold on you got you got fruitcake we got
we got all sorts of stuff working out in
our favor here
this is a boss trap room pop this
saved
there we go saved that's the save you
versus the save
she told you not to worry about now we
will probably win this run easily
just pay out now doubter confirmed what
you scared doubters
shot speed down who cares lemon party
who cares
now we got three hp 18 damage
18 damage okay it's easy sweep
and then it's so simple
it's not simple i'm a fool i'm a genius
i just can't imagine like putting your
money on
on doubt who are you the melvin capital
of twitch
really makes you think i would love to
fly
like feel like flying is worth like
like three hearts per floor
not just in terms of dodging but also
like you know being able to pick up like
those batteries for example
yeah i just want to fly oh what you what
oh what you want sugar ray baby
sorry some of you guys aren't ready for
music that's that heavy but
milk you know we have so much damage how
could i not at least
oh it's buddy in a box that's
interesting so we got a big damage
downgrade but it came with triple shot
which is pretty good
let's go we in this i'm here to tell you
believers act like you've been there
before okay
it's still pretty tough i'm not i'm not
fully convinced on this one yet
we try this yet range down i'm not gonna
take it
bold choice i'm not gonna
guess i'll die like okay
that that room um
i i may have to pick up the red
telephone for that room
i'm not totally sure about that one
maybe i've just got to pay more
attention but i'm like it's a bit much
that you get
shoved into the corner and then uh
also have to take damage coming out the
other side what the heck
no
pay out the doubters
we were right that we had it the room
was under control
an attempt was made on that one slash
marker
repentance two now that one hurts let me
let me
get it out of the queue of my brain by
going to twitch.tv now



you only get one chance to make a first
impression and i've already
had my first impression made of the game
because of the fact that i played a
little on youtube but you only get a
second chance to make a good first
impression on the stream
here we are the first streamed run of
the binding of isaac repentance uh
central 272. thank you for the gifted
subscriptions as well and
woodfox thank you as well i apologize
things are whipping by pretty quickly
right now
so uh i i appreciate all the support
from cowboy killer for example
but we're just gonna we're gonna have to
focus on the run a little bit here
see some new stuff of course you play as
isaac first okay
oh you stole my you stole my charge no
wait dude yeah you stole my charge you
jerk
i meant i'm at zero and now they're like
uh
they're not upset anymore they stole all
my my lithium
how dare they rude lightning bugs that's
a good name
i've been calling them yellow flies i
don't know if you can understand how i
got the inspiration for that but
it's the honest-to-goodness truth been a
little bit more
uh free form shall we say with the way
i've been playing the game you know
because this brand new
trying to experience some of the new
stuff there are a few things i've
noticed
for example uh in particular enemy shot
speed seems to be improved
uh well like increased at least enemy uh
fire rate or at least like the attack
speed
also seems to be much higher as well um
new patterns obviously some some areas
afterwards
you got to take it robo baby oh
nice sound though how about that
you're still around i used to watch you
when i was 10 i'm
70 now thank you for your service sir
appreciate everything you've done for
this country have you noticed as well
that the
um the shop is open by default what's up
with that
and you can get all sorts of cool items
like tier detonator and then not have
the charge necessary to reroll them
hey you know what though hold on hold on
maybe it's been changed
i don't think so but still it's worth a
try
um i'm going to get a little spicy here
maybe maybe i shouldn't but you got to
give it a try right like
i'll do you one more i mean come on it's
only uh
you know five gifted subs on the line no
big deal
what's with the popping sound um excuse
me the popping sound
shows some respect that's robo baby he's
doing his best
and i will also say the game is uh
very hard
[Laughter]
i i in the interview with ed i
definitely i had the tendency to be like
you know he was like hey hard mode's
actually gonna be difficult and in my
head i was like yeah but he means for
like normies not for like
god gamers like me um
but uh i he meant for even god gamers
such as myself
yo z master zion thank you you didn't
have to do that but i appreciate it
thank you
cube of meat now we're talking of course
i should have known it was coming but
that's that's good stuff
um so i think we're we're out of here
man
yeah we're out of here we're gonna go
down to the special floor let's get
excited here
cobalt died on his first run i'm i'm i
i shouldn't say i'm happy to hear that
because it sounds like i'm being super
rude
but i am i'm happy to hear that from the
perspective of
like um you know at least i wasn't the
only one
[Laughter]
okay hold on there's gonna be a bucket
boy a hundred percent i predict
hey what the of course they're shooting
because they always shoot
hmm mom's bra or a question mark
this is where you start doing the monty
hall problem you hit the space bar on
this one
spilled milk or a question mark that's
an easy decision oh son of a
[Laughter]
now i wish i took the question or the
spilled milk maybe they've changed it
but you know what we're building quite
the stable of uh familiars here i
suppose
got a long way to go until we get some
some usefulness here like
uh an orb wait hold on i remember
i remembered this item triangle man
doing the things a triangle can it's a
space bar item that does something
related to brimstone
temporary demon form sulfur
i think it's brimstone for one room or
something that's pretty good
and by the way i mean did you see the
diagonal walking
no big deal um i i was surprised how
much i remembered of uh
of anti-birth when i started playing but
then i i remember i guess i have spent
like you know
probably like a hundred hours or so
maybe
a little bit more on anti-birth i played
it for a reasonable length of time
now many people will tell you this was
probably not the right room to use
sulfur on and i think those people are
absolutely correct
um we very realistically could end up
dying
you know our our first boss i'm a little
uh
or second boss i'm a little scared by
the boss rooms like it reminds me of
being a
young little whippersnapper playing
isaac for you know the very first time
getting hit
17 times on the monstro fight being like
how could anybody possibly predict these
movements
uh but we're gonna we're gonna do our
best hold it together
the problem with the orbital is we we
don't have like
the muscle memory for all these enemy
patterns you know set in our brain yet
so it's very like difficult to walk into
the enemies and and just hope for the
best right
okay what's going on with the pool
bucket maybe i don't want to know lil
blub
little blub you're you know what i've
never been happier to have uh robo baby
we'll just keep our distance and and try
to preserve this 100 deal with the devil
chance
that we've already seen now that i think
of or now that i remember but that's
fine
oh snap mom found my bucket
mom it's not a poo bucket i told you
it's my
jenkim fermenter it's a delicacy
in some parts of the internet
that's a good item okay i mean mostly
for survivability but still i'm eating
um i'm i'm happy where we stand i choose
not to take this
i choose not to take this we gotta be a
little we gotta
slow our roll a little bit we gotta
relax
we got brimstone once every three rooms
what do we do
we oh you gotta hit the buttons you
gotta hit the buttons it's that simple
what happens if you push this too far
away to be able to hit the button
or blow up the rocks i guess you just
wait
until the the door opens up
you just lose lull forehead
okay what do you do oh i remember you
okay see i've got i've got some memory
of these items
yeah the doors they open automatically
after a bit but
so we have new baby that i remember
but i don't remember what it does but
here's the thing it's a familiar
so let's add to our ridiculous familiar
account
iced iced baby i knew it i knew we were
getting conjoined man
that is unexpected um that's that's a
transformation that's pretty rare
perfect lilith run
yo new tier effect just dropped
mr freeze has been real quiet since the
repentance patch just dropped
okay we got six keys and no money why
can't i have six money and no keys man
conjoined used to need five familiars ah
see that's why i you know i've played a
lot of isaac
i'm very happy that the the chats here
to keep me honest with some of the
mechanics that might
escape me i.e anything that is not just
like
dodging and shooting in particular i
don't really know what's happening here
um so i'm just gonna pick up this money
and get the heck out of get the heck out
of here
get that are you gonna hit some enemies
you kick some enemies uh brimstone
please thank you
we could use some statistics
some attributes would be very helpful
he's spinning me
he's got me caught in the in the riptide
man remember when you couldn't go
anywhere without hearing that song
gotta swim
you don't remember that one
i do he's got you wrapped around his
finger
dear
oh wait a minute that's right hold on
if you used in in anti-birth
if you used sulfur twice in the same
room
you got a permanent brimstone upgrade
i remember that now it's been a while
now if we get a battery charge the dream
may come to pass
i'm looking at this i gotta be i gotta
be honest with you i'm looking at this
maybe we could get a battery but we need
two batteries in the shop because we
don't have it full charge now
um i think
i think we have to go everyone's saying
oh i okay i see the spoiler now all
right all right
you can't it's not enough for you is it
just to watch the new stuff it's always
gotta
you gotta eat your 100 steak in a single
bite
all right so you step on this
and then you you enter the the minus
realm
no i'm not sweating the spoilers i mean
again it like it's really just a matter
of like when you want to expose yourself
to
the spoilers and i think that i i accept
that you know most of what i know about
isaac in general essentially came
from uh
being told so i
i don't mind the spoilers quite frankly
okay hold on we're in dark side of the
moon right now
so very cursed anti-troll bomb is very
cursed
i do wonder if you get hit in the mirror
world i wonder what happens
i'm gonna guess that when you get hit
uh i'm gonna guess you got spit out but
i did get hit once and it didn't happen
oh that's red knife piece one and then
you get knife piece two somewhere else
as well and then you get ah
yeah yeah yeah i remember now
okay just keep it moving we should be
doing the occasional little brimstone
andy here for sure
but don't forget i do love you know
kicking these enemies
i think we can leave now but if we don't
leave we might be able to get
a battery charge from the shop create
permanent brimstone and win the run
and become the greatest isaac gamer that
pleasant park has ever seen
i don't know the keys look so messed up
when they're reversed i don't know like
what what happens
if we fight you i don't want to use
brimstone against you because i want to
save the possibility for a charge here
i'm also worried if i get hit once i'll
die
but you know who theirs wins man again
what's the worst what's the worst thing
that could happen oh we have to give out
a bunch of gift subs
no big deal my my daughter goes hungry
cause
dad didn't think he was gonna die he had
too much hubris down at the isaac casino
again
whatever i'm i did it i'm amazing
that's an item i can get down with that
baby baby's gonna be fine i was just it
was mostly a joke
she might have to downgrade to the uh
the long range model instead of the
performance though okay
we're we're safe again we're free
now we go to the shop and if the shop
has
a battery charge we might be able to
cheese it but then
this might not be a repentance mechanic
we're gonna go can we go back into the
mirror realm
maybe we can go back into the mirror
realm
f f f f nope all right well you know
what
i think we're going to buy a spear at
heart and we're going to head down to
the next floor and we're going to
continue to live our lives
and learn about the game piecemeal
instead of all at once
it's a valuable bomb though don't get me
wrong
oh right we got bombs hold on i thought
we were gonna get stuck here
please get the yoyo string
i may consider getting the yoyo string
sick mundus vibes yeah i'm like it i'm
just you know what it is i'm enjoying
the brief period about the game
where like chad's been watching some
other streamers and they think they got
it all figured out man
because all i'm gonna say is that the
the world change is mighty quickly
especially uh in this day and age you
know right now
people are like i think i got it all
figured out just wait until you see
something you ain't never seen before
because all the other streamers are
dying on like the caves one
okay mysterious liquid plus conjoined 10
out of 10
setup
i have no problems here i still want to
like i want to save uh
the sulfur much like
uh city in color saved their scissors is
that who sang that song maybe it was
just dallas green i can't remember i
don't listen to a lot of canadian radio
these days
yo the song is kind of poggy
check this out you're not ready for that
one yet but your kids
are gonna love it oh i forgot red button
damages everything okay how's that for a
spoiler
i'm not trash talking sim victor i'm
trash talking apollo
okay sorry that was really bad dodging
oh
it would be like i'm can i tell you the
first few runs i did of this today
i was very happy that we did lost runs
yesterday because to get in the habit of
not having much hp
um that was that was very very uh
nice i think that helped me out a lot
today
now what the heck do we have here mom's
bracelet oh i
hold on hold on check this out
now i gotta be honest with you sulphur
is like
probably better can i pick this guy up
oh man come on come on can i destroy him
with it
no this is kind of fun
like obviously we can use it for like
you know
blowing things up like getting cool
mechanics
based stuff but we can also pick up some
rocks and throw them in enemies which
i'm sure does a lot of damage
the charge time is really uh
it's quite uh low on that
pick mom up i bet you'd like that
wouldn't you
sicko okay this is definitely a second
secret room you can't sneak that
by me um what are you
a punk demon judgment
i don't know take my money
[Laughter]
okay and then oh no
i've doubled it up did it did it work i
don't
i don't know it looks kind of sick
though
all right you okay this is a it's a
gauntlet fight you just got to survive
the waves
yo it it's thick brimstone kick it
it'll be fun please please
proptosis brimstone bro
i have infinite range could i i just
need to shoot this guy where it where
the heck
the charge time the charge time i
thought that was my fire i don't even
have fire what are you talking about
you're okay you're okay you remember
great stuff great stuff do it again
wave five please there we go wave five
yankee hat with thick brim now we're
talking
wave six i desire wave six
i don't even know what it is i'm very
happy that i have like
pseudo-infinite range here otherwise we
would be in a world of hurt you've
unlocked the ash bit
of course not a problem uh do we have
cool room
no cool room on this one
now here's the moment of truth do we
still have anything when we leave
no okay but that's neat it's good to
know
so if you use sulfur twice on the same
room you get a cool brimstone
honestly i'm going to be straight up
with you i think that's a sensible nerf
uh being it basically being one battery
charge away from being able to create
brimstone
uh yourself is that's pretty powerful
what if you use it three times oh
oh what an interesting idea
yeah i've seen the other um
some couple or a couple of other
streamers play the game with the mini
item hud
uh sell me on it okay so like the the
thing with it
look i've been wrong before it allows
you to see
all of the items right like not just the
the most recent eight or whatever
it takes up less room does it though or
does it
actually take up more room once you get
more items
let's see mini hud
yeah you know i think it definitely
takes less room i apologize for my
rhetorical question
it looks much better i feel like i just
had a breath of fresh air or something
like i feel i feel nice
that's it i feel like i can see
something oh
no no time and score either oh dude
you're right but how will i know what my
score is if i don't have my score on the
screen
i'm gonna be so confused about what my
score is at
and how will we know if i'm making boss
rush well that's easy enough i i'm not
even
i've never been even close to making
boss rush in in repentance so far
now we still got some problems okay
damage is slightly better than usual
i think our rate of fire is okay
i'll open that for sure for sure for
sure um
i actually think i don't want mega brim
for a room
so simple as this it's not necessary i'd
rather get an extra brim on a future
floor
or on a future room i should say
and this is so far we definitely i i
would
remain pessimistic as of right now
about our ability to win the run
but very optimistic about our ability to
have a good time
and to hope both teams have fun and
everybody out there watching from home
uh has a good time i'm just rooting for
a good game
i just hope all the players have fun so
i
i kind of like the idea of box of
friends but it's like
i i i gonna take some more convincing
i'm just gonna be honest like
i don't think our familiars are are that
big of a deal right now unfortunately by
the way like uh if you're
if you're watching along it's possible
especially if you came from youtube
you don't watch the streams
all that often we've screwed it up i
wonder it
i i you put a bomb in this you hit this
and then you kick it really fast
that's what we're talking about um yeah
if it's your first time here
uh give me a follow i'm just gonna ask
for it you know we're gonna be playing
isaac a lot
like most of the time i i play a lot of
isaac don't get me wrong but it's mostly
been on youtube in the past
we're riding a new wave of of fatherhood
um so i've been doing a lot more twitch
we'll be playing a ton of isaac here
and you're probably gonna maybe you're
gonna be on youtube and you're gonna be
like what the heck where's the four
episodes a day
well they're on twitch and they take a
couple extra days to get to youtube so
i would encourage you to you know strike
while the irons hot if you like what you
see
and if you don't you know no pressure
either way
i'm scared i would love to see hold on
what do we need here
i'm going to call it because can you
imagine oh my god the cl the clip
farming if this ends up being correct
the number one item we need right now is
the relic if we can get the relic
if we can get the relic this is if
you're not familiar with the culture of
twitch this is called clip farming
you bet on the likelihood of something
happening if it happens
you get uh an incredible clip
if it doesn't happen you disable clips
so that you don't even need to know
if the relic shows up in here 100 gives
subs to chat
sorry chad edmond doesn't want you to
get give subs
sorry explain yourself edmond
backstabbed again
an attempt was made that's fine
it's all good you know it's we're just
in you know real
survival hours right now half-life full
life consequences
what if you got it i would i would honor
the terms of the deal but i would have
to make a quick phone call to visa first
it would disrupt the stream the stream
slightly
wonder what maybe we've got to hit all
the golden buttons to get the
to get that path unlocked
certainly seems like it okay okay very
interesting
at first i thought we just had to be
really quick but yeah i think we got to
hit all the buttons
and then we get in the mine card
this is where you're gonna get the
second key piece
maybe yo this is this is kind of like
gungenesque in here huh
what the heck was going on
i'm scared about what's gonna happen
like it's gonna be like a crash
bandicoot section or something like that
when we leave here we're gonna get
chased by something
i knew it i knew it get me out of here
[Laughter]
i know what they put they put up the
blockers man oh
they don't want you to win they don't
want you to get healthy
there you go dodge of the cinch
he's going he's going this is we've
trained for this
just take your time how do i get out man
this is not how you get out
i need the bomb great great throw great
throw kid
don't get cocky okay send it send it
we're free
spikes
mommy
just chill no he's so good he's the
greatest player of all time
what the you weren't even on the screen
you liar
little weasley liar dude okay i see what
we got to do here
keep it moving keep him we're almost
there almost there almost there he's
done it he's not he's free
oh but she's mad she's mad
okay i don't know what those sounds are
but i'm i'm very frightened but gaming
has been accomplished
the true isaac gamer has logged on that
was
that was a little scary but for a first
try i thought we did pretty good and
plus we got this cool little knife now
freaking sexy knife doing all this
damage out here
there's a tinted rock in there no i
don't believe you
i don't believe you
hold on i can i'm not looking at chat i
can find it i'm not
owned oh it's the wrong room i'm not
owned
so it's jeez right under my nose
thank you chad thank you couldn't have
done it without you you got to step on
the button
saved okay 46
chance of a deal with the devil i would
say it's probably lower just because i'm
fairly likely to lose this half spirit
heart and take damage but
you know only time will tell a strength
card
i don't know if the i feel like the
strength card based on what i know about
these deals with the devil now
i feel like the strength card might be a
little nerfed like you might have to use
it more for its
intended purpose now instead of it's uh
you know the meme play where you use it
to
scam and deal with the devil
so what a shot man if you hit a frozen
enemy
into an enemy i think it freezes that's
that's pretty high value eats
memes will still work can i tell you i'm
just a little frightened here i just
want to go take a look
i just want to go take a look first
maybe the shop has red hearts for sale i
don't know do i have to donate more to
the shots
to the shops i should say
i don't know oh placenta i forgot we got
placenta
from the mirror realm dude now knowing
that there's other items we can get
there more easily
i understand i understand where we're
going here you take a sip of the bubbly
i remember these guys nl's stream
actually bigger than an f1 driver uh you
have a which
which f1 driver
i'm not gonna name names but you know if
lewis hamilton was streaming and we beat
him in the view count i'd be like
he's like one of the greatest drivers of
all time
you take my hp i don't mind go ahead
take it
take take my blood if you need it
no hp for us okay we're heading down to
the next floor
hold on magic mush
you gotta look
oh wait it's okay it's just the speed up
but that's still pretty good
all right here we go here we go
orlando no it's impossible lando is both
a
an amazing driver he came in fourth this
weekend
which is insanely good um and i am not
being facetious for people who aren't
aware of f1
and also the ultimate meme lord
i would never i would never dare in salt
land though
you won't find me doing this too much
it's it's a new era
and yet the more things change the more
the more they stay the same
okay we like it we like it a lot we like
it a lot a lot
that's pretty good
i don't i don't know where my hp is at i
know that they
nerfed
i know they nerfed uh demon
judgment so now you can't double play
him
but still we have hp
i'm gonna get i gave you three and then
i'm gonna go get a little taste over
here
yeah yeah yeah why
well it just makes sense like i know
that people anytime there's a nerf the
developers
have to justify themselves way more than
when there's a buff and like some of
this stuff
like you know the cramp is being nerfed
to you know every six rooms and then
possibly uh change back spoilers uh in
the in the new version
like that stuff is kind of uh
you know i i wouldn't necessarily
describe it as anti-fun but i think that
it was a nerf nobody asked for
the demon judgment stuff to me it seems
kind of like
sensible like why could you double play
a demon judgment to begin with it just
seems like an error
oh whoops i forgot you you throw some
rocks at me um
it seems like an error of like the the
default
uh invincibility frames that you get
from getting hit is too
uh is too high so i i think it made
sense that was one i was i was not salty
to
discover i was like you know you're mad
for like two seconds because it takes
away one of your engines and then you're
like you know what i think it's actually
fairly sensible
it made sense to me at least
now removing uh the double sulfur in the
brimstone plate
somebody better lose their job for that
uh mishap
oh no baby
the devs have gone too far when will you
learn that your actions have
consequences okay we got a lucky penny
if we give relic 100 gift subs
okay now you're putting me in a tough
spot because
you have to take contagion so i i
basically removed the clip farm ability
there but that's a really good item
that's one it's hard to say no to i
apologize
i'll admit it could have been the relic
and if it was well we just saved
ourselves
some some money okay quick little smack
that's very sad it's fine now it doesn't
just seem
satisfying though like it seems uh
it seems really good like it it seems
like a good
like aoe type option it's kind of neat
i'm down to explore that a little bit
more ice shots seem insanely good
so i gotta i'm gonna spoil something
about an upcoming isaac episode for you
an upcoming repentance episode but i
really i want to ask you okay
because i i don't know what was
happening yeah so victor maybe you saw
it on your stream
i did a run and all of my boss items
were uh deals with the devil
what's up with that man
like i i the first time i got it oh
because of satanic bible
of course i did have satanic bible
i did so dude that's a cool
people are saying is a nerf i actually i
understand why it would be a nerf
but all your boss items become deals
with the devil
like they have to deal with the devil
effect like you have to pay for them
with hp but they also have to deal with
the devil
uh pool that's amazing
no it still generates the demon hearts
for you too every six rooms like that's
that's pretty sick man
that's pretty sick okay hold on what do
you
what do you want from me what do you
want from me here
i i know what you want from me check
this out i'm a gamer
i'm a gamer i'm not like other
hobbyists i'm a gamer i'm a gamer
he's gaming um okay mausoleum one we're
ready we're ready
i vaguely recall you existing in
anti-birth
you you're a siren you sing songs and
you you took my familiars against me
she's turned the wings against this
sorry i apologize the accent is just not
good i might just turn the wings against
you
oh yeah yeah we're fine
turns out we're fine go ahead take them
they're trash
okay well that's a little rude not the
trash thing but
you know us getting hit by the physical
damage come on
you've unlocked joanna 1 million percent
just stop
i'm so good
[Laughter]
i just i just beat the game
okay this is this is mighty tricky for
me because
uh help uh i
i don't really want to
get rid of sulfur
but i do want to forget me now
so let's do it it'll be fun
it'll be fun that's that's my main
driving force right now it'll be full
it'll be full it'll be fun uh we do have
that demon judgment back there we played
a lot of but i'm i'm not convinced
that it's about to pay out
how many episodes of of isaac have you
recorded
not that many honestly um
i think there's three in the books right
now
okay let's see if we get some spirit
hearts if we get some spirit hearts
i'm much more likely to play the demon
judgment a little bit
still got one that's not bad no keys
remain
one sec this this is valuable man we got
good stuff happening here
no hold strength strength is worth
something
this is a yolo run a free yolo marty you
definitely blow this up
also very good one two
three please
i'll take it i believe in you
got me that's pretty good though
um i'm gonna strengthen do it two more
times
and then one more time
i'm scared yo saved saved
okay and then saved
i thought that said boat speed up and i
went
what all right okay okay we going to the
course room we forget me now inside of
the curse room
yes
he's he's a mad genius he's ascended
that's still pretty good it's not items
but it actually might be more valuable
okay mausoleum one with tons of hp
my dad is your biggest fan yo that's
actually sick
like i'm always thankful
when people are like i love watching
your videos that's a nice thing to hear
um but when someone's like i watch your
videos with my family
and they think you're hilarious i'm like
they got options man
and they've been on this earth a lot
longer so like the compliment just means
that much more
you know when someone's like 12 and
they're like i love your videos i'm like
what do you know you know you've never
even seen
a fellini film you don't know what's out
there
when someone's like 65 and they're like
i like your content i'm like oh man
that's incredible
sharp key i remember it's a it's a
throwable mom's knife that also is like
infinite keys or something like that
something like this like i don't want to
use it for nothing just in case i'm
misremembering it but something like
that
i wish that my girlfriend liked your
videos i'm here to tell you like
honestly don't sweat it that much
um i'm just trying to figure out sorry i
was in the middle of making the bit
and i stopped but it's because i'm
trying to figure out what the heck this
item does
um it just does it use keys
it uses a key every time you shoot it
okay that's a lot
um that's you know it i bet it does a
lot of damage but we'll save that for
situations where we have some uh
we have the ability to recklessly spend
some keys
um it's all good like kate and i we
don't really watch
a lot of the same youtube content
it's just too much man just give me a
second leave me a second to think about
that
like you used to we used to watch like
some good mythical morning together and
stuff like that
it's nice to have shared hobbies but you
know you also you know you like what you
like
we gotta take it for the synergy for
sure
i mean honestly it's really boring but
like thanks to placenta we have a really
good
opportunity to just stay alive no matter
what okay the heretic
i okay yeah i remember you we gotta like
blow up your familiars and then the
pennies take care of themselves
by the way mysterious liquid has now
become the the strongest item
in video game history as a result of
this uh
this uh dr fetus synergy like assuming
the enemy was actually
a terrestrial enemy on the ground
that's tough to dodge you know what i
i really hope that that would do a
little bit more damage with the key but
all right all right all right okay
now krampus here here's your your
spoiler i have
gotten krampus's head and they did
restore the pre-nerf
uh charge limit to it which is pretty
sweet
that's pretty sick and honestly is sick
enough i think we're gonna roll with it
because we're not really
running on keys right now we don't we
don't have a ton of them so let's take
marrow always nice
you love to see it we we i should have
taken more hp there my mistake
um you know we we stand
a development team that's that's not
afraid to walk
back on popular uh decisions
now edmund if you're still here i'm not
like other gamers like
i'm i'm uh a gamer who blames myself for
all of my problems
uh so i personally thought it was fine
if anything i thought you should
actually nerf it a little bit more like
maybe make krampus head like an item you
can only use one time
good luck kid you know what i love about
a dan raid
you can tell that it's a dan raid
without even knowing that it's a dan
raid like tell me you're a dan raider
without telling me you're a dan raider
yes sir yo
ox can i get a bacon egg and cheese
salt and pepper ketchup mayo on a roll
yes sir you already know the vibe can't
forget the bev you know i gotta cop that
area yes sir
dana oh and this is i'm being very
sincere
of let me rephrase the stream
that i watched you play this morning
where you were playing this game
i was very impressed with your play no
joke
i was like you know i i watched you play
a little isaac
maybe three or four months ago and i was
like i feel like this guy has no idea
what he's doing and then i watched you
play today and i was like what the heck
he was
he was sandbagging the whole time this
guy was just pretending to not know
the the language of isaac when actually
he he speaks it fluently
smiling impact
uh goat head monkey s but i am here to
tell you
dan that the shoes on the other foot now
now it is you who should be careful
because you're gonna get spoiled because
we're about to
bust this mystery wide open
i mean are you seeing this run when we
shoot they shoot
that's that's tough um but you know what
would make it easier
it didn't work oh you can't kill him
just step on the button fool
okay even better but you gotta admit
it was a 200 iq play if it worked
that would have been a 200 iq play oh
they charge
it's like it's hades
wow sounds like david lee roth at the
end of the shot of the devil
what's going on oh it's you
scared scared
no are you scared i'm not scared i'm not
owned
saved
teleport me thank you this is it's easy
people have been saying oh they made the
game too hard
i don't think so man check this out you
know you just gotta remember what it's
like to be uh
to have a game that isn't afraid to make
you work for it you know
i know a lot of games out there are like
oh
i did everything right but the i the
impostor i sussed out
got hard cleared by somebody else and
now i lost because of something that i
couldn't control
come on man you got to get back to a
game that's not afraid to
it's not afraid to kick you in the face
a couple times you know what i mean
stop roasting among us they chose
violence
when they chose to release their new map
on the same day
that repentance came out repentance was
ahead in
in the lineup they announced it in
september 2018 when among us was
was a mere fever dream
they chose violence never forget
that's a good chest man that's a good
one
no turrets please thank you oh look at
that
so inspirational
i wish it wasn't among us though because
the developers seem very nice and
wholesome
and i am rooting for them
but you know when when you come for the
king of the indie games
you best not miss
i can recognize mathias voice
the heck is jihana too
new mom new mom just dropped i've taken
oh yeah you can't walk into the foot
anymore
oh but dude she's gonna get freaking
bodied
by uh by the creep
she's done she's toasted she never stood
a chance and then we have the key
so check this out
[Laughter]
oh what i forgot about that part
mom's heart it it lives gets hit by
creep
so it's possible mom's heart will get
hit by creep as well
kate your husband is about to break the
world record for
best isaac player
you're about why
you you know what that is that's that's
the competing
uh the competing desire of mom and dad
i always want food and then
when i uh oh she's she's bringing her in
here
i was i was wondering where my my cold
air went
baby jail hello
i don't know if i can sneak her uh into
the frame here but i'll do my best
you got a steering wheel
hey baby hello there you go
oh she's she's been covered oh it's
invicta thanks for the gift itself
hello baby hey hey
how you doing could you tell daddy if
you want food or you feed
you yeah baby do you want food or no
food
baby
oh my gosh she just babbled appa but
then the
subscribe emo covered her face oh no she
just said her first word it was uh
it was pog
i've already uh i've said it at the
start of this run
pardon me but i've been i've been very
clear about
roddenhart has appeared in the basement
the only reason there is so much uh
isaac content today is because of the
generosity of my wife
foregoing our normal morning routine
in order to uh give me some extra space
to get some isaac content out there so
make sure if you're enjoying the content
that is now and also to come you say
thank you kate
why stop there subscribe okay you know
see oh to kate's channel okay that's
that's one way to do it
you'll have you're going to stream
tonight right you know what you're going
to play
not isaac okay confirmed if you're one
of the people here that is uh
not a fan of isaac then uh
later tonight you can watch kate play uh
whatever she's gonna play nan she'll
she'll be the only
channel on twitch playing not isaac not
outriders
and not uh among us
years old tonight now come on it's hey
is that
this game is actually seven years old
come on
it's not like our baby's birthday is the
same
that is true i can't believe she
actually she told her husband to get a
life
savage classic bougie
ratchet oh you know that
i think it's meg the stallion
i know it from tick tock if she's
behaving so well
you can feed the baby here if you want
like i'm not
i mean i'm not gonna tell you no
i'm i'm sure people would be interested
i don't i
i'm gonna be honest with you guys i
don't think i can take bob's brain
we already have like enough uh
we got enough problems here
i don't think i can do it what are you
bonking for
i don't understand what people are
bonking for
not everything's horny just because
you're horny
okay i'm a fool i should not have stood
there and now they want me to take bob's
brain
skip
she likes it are these the green beans
oh
i told this the story in my episode
today
where i was like i told the story a few
days ago where my
my wife uh told me to go buy green beans
at the grocery store and then when i
came back she's like what are these
and i was like green beans and then
she's like oh i needed edamame
and then the story got even more
developed last night
because she opened up the baby cookbook
and is like see why do these green beans
look so weird whereas the ones in the
book look like so big
and i was like you know my wife those
are uh
those are peas
not even come on don't stop taking the
damage here
i guess the korean description was green
beans but
it is so good
so we we wasted well let's not say
wasted because we did get some food out
of it but
oh hold on hold on some spider bombs
um we did uh spend like half
an hour slicing open the green beans and
then
taking the individual like nanometer
sized green beans out of the pods
and we were like it's gonna it's gonna
take so long for us to like fill up this
bowl with these tiny green beans
it turns out it's because they should
have been peas the whole time
which actually are quite large
especially
they are they are similar for sure
i think peas are a type of bean that's
my guess
okay what the heck what the heck is this
chimera
again i feel like in another life i have
seen you but i don't remember what it is
you do
oh god but dude we're gonna win this run
i don't know how deep this goes
we'll see how deep the rabbit hole goes
oh oh oh
what a shot whatever dude do you think i
care about missing a deal with the devil
because i don't that much
we don't love to see it unfortunately
we're going to be moving on here
we good on hp we're good on hp we've
been to both secret rooms yeah
get me out of here take a little bit of
the bubbly
hey look at that you don't need to hold
that up that's uh
you know we we run the risk of
alienating some people i think in
in that department but i i am happy for
her
i am just going to leave this room i i
do not like these enemies
answer the door what the heck's going on
okay well
baby you doing okay who dares knock on
our door
like during the repentance launch stream
dude what if it was admin that'd be
pretty
sick
who was it science and sinners
final fantasy 14 the new ost hot
drop the new hot ost
from final fantasy 14. hey hey kate hey
kate
hey kate isn't that game like seven
years old
i think so wouldn't you be thinking that
perhaps you
should at this point maybe in your own
words so to speak uh
can we say maybe get a life but
mmorpg i suppose i didn't think about
that
mmorpg is life you know what is in life
isaac no isaac isaac is life uh
i was gonna say the cake the cake is a
is a lie
got her
[Laughter]
got it roasted roasted by a true gamer
guy got your back got your back okay all
right
uh we've been live for like an hour
we're on the same run
and i'm killing it i'm i'm amazing
i think at this point like the best way
to
rotten hearts they give flies when you
lose them i think
um the best way to give out the smallest
amount of gift subs possible
is to just make every run last as long
as possible oh that cold air is mighty
nice thank you
oh that feels great
but what's your score where we're going
we don't need scores remember that one
only nerds will understand only 90s kids
will get that one
it's from a little movie called um the
karate kid
help i'm safe
little bubbly break
isaac versus mother broken heart sounds
like a father john misty song
what the okay everybody gets one
saved
no health bar dude
okay knife comes in knife goes out you
can't explain that that hurt that hurt
me okay she's doing quite a lot of
damage
mmm snakes
let's go good dodge good dodge she's got
another one coming in
good focus good focus that hurt that
hurt me
i i won oh lord
oh what the heck
okay save safe not safe at all
extremely dead
we have invincibility you should have
used it close
so close though
[Laughter]
that was a good run nonetheless of
course i'm going to give out some gift
subs
i'm a man of my word slash marker first
pardon me first run complete



i am going to
just do my best
to unlock the new character one pardon
me one of the two new characters
so we're not gonna take alt paths
we're just gonna just play it cool
this is a spicy room to start with
we're just gonna play it cool here it is
it's so bright now dude
it looks so bad now
it's never enough for you folks is it
gamma please crank it crank the gamma
you crank the gamma
150 are you insane 137 is the optimal
uh gamma level
something something 100 steak in a in a
single bite we're not a monolith
i kind of think it looks it looks sick
my personal take
it looks sick
i'm keeping it man i can see i can see
between the floorboards
it's a new texture pack
i can i can see under the floorboards i
gotta tell you
i think i just spoiled myself
all right i'll tell you what i'm gonna
i'm gonna lower the gamma
to 141.
there you go that that's as low as we're
getting
perfect what 141 and 3 8 please
permaban 24 hour ban
permanent
actually better i i'm gonna be honest
with you maybe my eyes are broken but i
don't notice a difference
at all it looks exactly the same to me
me either maybe we'll take it down to
like 136 real quick
i don't know
this room don't forget you're here
forever
there was a significant difference oh
really what was its p value then
under 0.05 i doubt it
all right before we fight this boss
we're going all the way back we didn't
get an item yet
it's dd mega doo doo value
it's a big floor man am i insane it
feels like the curses have
been a little bit uh more prolific thus
far
i feel like they've recently changed the
incidence rates and
the proc values of the uh of the curses
repeating of course
new hard mode does indeed increase curse
rate i'm gonna be honest ahead i don't
know if you're still here
i don't mean this to be to be negative
at all but uh
i i saw like two hours before midnight
you dropped like the change log
i opened it up and i was like i'm gonna
read this and then i saw how
tiny the scroll bar got like how much
you would have to scroll in order to
read the whole thing
and i went nah i just closed the tab and
i went to bed
i was like that's way too and then like
the first thing was like you know
they were all about like individual item
changes and stuff like that and i'm like
there's no way
like i'll leave that to purge purge
gaming
i'll do it live
okay static tears very strong item no
no question there
it is nice that you get the first shop
free now no doubt about that
it is also nice that they finally came
to their senses and and nerfed uh a
thame
and put it in the see that's the thing i
i just knew a thame was gonna get nerfed
i was so confident of it that i uh
i i put it in the tier where i thought
it belonged to begin with
if you really wanted to watch the world
burn you know what you would do now
is uh re-rank
all the items but make a theme higher
[Laughter]
now that's a good idea
now we're talking
okay we have keys we got speed is this
always a lockdown
believe that answers the question clip
farming
it actually isn't oh snake eater okay
here we go what the heck
double key room that wants another key
you said no alt path oh frick
you're absolutely right oh no my static
tears dude
whatever we'll we'll do the alt path
because we're the only reason we're on
the alt path
anyway is to get uh
the double items that we can get from
the mirror and then once we get the
mirror
we'll just bounce dude then then we're
out of here
all right that was a good uh good use of
our time there um
but it's fine ludo static tears we got
no problems
although static tears doesn't do
anything now that's just until we break
the synergy with another synergy
i called i called debate on ludovico
moving these enemies
ludovico knockback i sure hope somebody
got fired for that blunder
ludo is actually pretty sick early on i
i got no complaints about that
except for the aforementioned knockback
so the mirror will be on the next floor
oh man these bosses are a little spicy
though
they can be a little spicy
i can smell that first win though you
smell that
that's victory
who farted good one why didn't i think
of that oh wait i did
i didn't i didn't know it was your how
dare you break win before me i didn't
know it was i'm sorry baby i didn't know
it was your turn
okay the easiest enemy of all time all
you do is
keep the crosshair on them and then walk
around in a circle
and then occasionally get hit but that's
fine
just just to make everybody else out
there feel better about getting hit
themselves
doubters be gone look at this easy win
easy hp down to the next floor feeling
pretty good
hp is precious man like there's there's
been times in my life i've insulted the
item a little bit
or the the stat you know the better you
get at the game the less
relative value hp has but obviously
you know with the new expansion dropping
times are a little tougher now
very happy to have as much hp as they'll
give me
what's up with the little ghosts oh come
on man what's up with the little ghosts
on the floor
i don't know if they're related to
anything but you know
it's the same as uh oh hello
like even when when like wrath of the
lamb came out there were all sorts of
crazy like conspiracy theories that
seemed comical in in hindsight
there's a room that has like the the
crest of belisle on the ground
in open flames um
i my brain can't do it it can't be done
uh and everybody was convinced that like
if you
use uh the book of belial
in the room with the belial crest
something crazy's got to happen and then
what actually happened is just you just
wasted your book of belial charge
because there's no enemies in the room
it was a good idea don't get me wrong
that would have been pretty cool
hagalaz gotta think about that okay okay
new dukka flies
realize realize real lies
duke of flies
squammy squam squammy swam
you know what you could use a little bit
of that
saved no
we were doing so well okay i think we're
done with the alt path temporarily
this run has a lot of lacking
we'll farm up the mirrors and then see
uh see what the the rest of the world
looks like
new worm just dropped
earthworms been real quiet since this
one came out
you know it'd be cool if you added like
a few more enemies into the game that do
like that monstro attack this impossible
to
freaking tell where the shots are gonna
land
i'm just salty i got hit yo what's up
with the blood door
i think i speak for the rest of twitch
when i say um
oh that's the sack room okay
sweep
i can't believe i didn't get hit i
deserve to i deserve to get hit there's
no question
oh am i hold on my brain's starting to
piece things together after
after an embarrassing length of time so
the alt floor
maybe always has the double item rooms
it always has like the bonus uh
question mark possibility that's cool
i thought it would just showed up either
always or randomly
okay so i gotta i gotta think for a
moment all right i need to find the uh
the white fire
and then i've gotta remember that when i
take damage i get
uh a tears upgrade and a tears upgrade
is
quite valuable
yeah we can make something happen here
you know i gotta cop that double item
room yes sir
this sounds like john bryan's original
soundtrack for eternal sunshine of the
spotless mind
real ones no
good i'm dead i'm alive because i'm
lazarus
but we can't unlock the the special
character now
which means i've got to go on the alt
path
because otherwise we got nothing to gain
man and when you ain't got nothing you
got nothing to lose
all right believers you're in i'll
probably actually just die right here
but believers times are tough if we make
it out of this
remember remember if you were a believer
nobody thought you had it in you
nobody thought nobody in the history
ever thought that this day would ever
end well guess what
it's never gonna end okay
okay hp please hp
the only thing i'm disappointed with is
the fact that we died in the minus realm
so by dying in the minus realm we didn't
get
our bonus um rate of fire ups
which is very disappointing but and then
we need the key piece that's
it just the key piece
no i dude i don't think we can take the
alt path i think i need to see what
what victory looks like
i mean also we don't have enough bombs
right now but
we're kind of in a tough spot here
it's a bit tricky
gotta go alt tell me you're a doubter
without telling me you're a doubter
yes sir gotta go the alt path coward
coward
egg lost his loss to zayn lost to zayn
you've changed man yes sir
empty shops
nothing in the putts all right well
we're going down to
we're going back to the non-minus realm
but i like i mean you can you can
say all the yes sirs you want to say
we can't go on the alt path if we only
have one bomb
we're stuck now if you could
inform me as to the location of the shop
we could maybe change that but
yeah i think we're uh i think we're
stuck
it's somewhere around there it is
there's no bomb for sale but there is
a sack the sac gave us a single key
honestly one of the greatest uh rip-offs
of
all time that's terrible
and two bombs it did give us a but
you're absolutely right
let's go doubters we're riding
we sucked up the bomb so fast oh and the
spirit hard wait that wasn't bad at all
doubters we ride at dawn
for the youtube audience a doubter is uh
someone who used their channel points to
bet on this being
uh a loss a believer
conversely is somebody who bet on this
run being a victory
okay the world is a vampire of course
we've said it many times before we'll
say it again
we're taking a question mark here
because the question mark could be
anything it could even be a mom item
takes a bit a little low-key
slap in the face i do see a library
though
and a library has a lot of value
i forgot what was happening oh loki is
actually
amazing because it works
with our uh with our static tears
okay okay so there's a chance here
the pog knows no bounce
i'm not even like aiming at anything i'm
just trying to get the static to hit
enemies but this is like
it's a bit messy no doubt
some survivability would would go a long
long way
so just throwing out there like it
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
if you would just
give me like the first damage upgrade
i've ever received
in my entire repentance history i knew
it too i knew it i was like just put me
in a safe spot come on man
they can't be dodged okay no doubters
not today not this room just one more
room
one more room can of corn and i'll be
all right can a corn
single key please a single key so we can
access the library
just chill let's chill we're chilling
not much dog what's up with you
lots of bombs single key please
yo they do be moving quick how did i get
hit by you before that's so embarrassing
all you do is
like move a little help
he's getting a little close yep okay you
got me
you got that's a tough one man
you know how it is yes sir pay out the
doubters we're going to run this one
back real quick
it is what it is i'm i'm a man of my
word
sir pay out the doubt that was the chat
took so long
to load that when i hit the mute button
it didn't actually mute tell me you're
muted without telling me you're muted
pay him
there they go all right now what happens
is this is
this is how good believers turn toxic
we're gonna unlock this character now
people that believed
the last two times
are gonna be doubters and then i'm gonna
win and they're gonna be like now it's
time to become the joker
it's this is how young gamers get
radicalized in twitch chat
you know i just wrote a blog post about
this this is like why i hate video
games they're the ultimate male power
fantasy
tough times never last
only tough people last
sorry once per stream i can do it once
per stream
and that's like mercy because i think
about it constantly
what is not always a lockdown
sometimes it's a shot speed up which is
almost as bad
golden bombs now we're talking
five joke andy imagine uh
making fun of someone's breathtaking
originality and humor
while simultaneously appending andy to
the end of your sentiment
like come on man try harder
the average egg enjoyer versus the uh
soy jack andy rider
what you should do is make a meme that's
like nl deciding which of his two jokes
to use
and then it's the guy in the spaceship
that's like patting his forehead
and then one button is like tough times
never last tough people last
and then the other button is like
see that would get me going that that
would get the memes started
i'm a germa fan you gremlin i don't know
what that means
you you're gonna insult me speak english
okay
otherwise how am i supposed to be
offended
also i'm not a gremlin you have me
confused with natsuki from
doki doki literature club
i'm not a cat we don't want that
spoilers
30 million in total on this bet yes sir
sorry
tell me you're a believer without
telling me you're a believer how do you
have 30
no 30 million total okay because i was
like if you have 30 million channel
points
you shouldn't have uh said it
because if i ever bring back channel
point rewards
which is on the fence um
now i have to set the minimum at like
you know 10 million
like i'm a match three indie game or
something like that

looking forward to it
who i'm stupid
whatever easy wins no not stupid built
different
now we're talking okay we're not doing
alt pat this time all path is for
cowards
we're not doing alt path we have to
unlock the new character bethany
you know any bethany's in real life i
knew one
she was on my robotics team in eighth
grade
and also i forgot you know i've told
this
this is deep lore i've told this story
before but like every year
at the school talent show um
there was a a duet of two young ladies
who always sang
that terrible christmas song christmas
shoes
guys can i buy these shoes for my mama
please
as just christmas even these shoes are
just her size
but then the store owner is like uh
actually uh you're 25 cents short so can
you put those back on the shelf
but then a nice the nicest person you'll
ever meet was like
i'll donate 26 cents to save your mom
daddy says there's not much time and and
his name
albert einstein anyway long story short
uh
bethany was one of the two ladies who
sang that song
every year and every year it made like
the same four teachers cry
that's it i mean she's a pretty nice
lady i got nothing against her
but i was pretty damn sick of the song
but you know that's fine
no she was a pretty good singer i just
think like her taste in music could use
some work but
like if she got up there and she started
singing like you know debaser by the
pixies i would have been like all
pog but you know
she wasn't ready for that it's a lot of
familiars in this game huh
what'd you do at the talent show
freaking watched in the audience
streaming hadn't been invented yet so
you know wrong place wrong time
people were like this guy is really
funny but like you can't just
you don't want to get up on stage and do
stand-up comedy in high school you know
all your jokes are going to go over
their heads
most popular comedian back then was dane
cook
i can't compete with that dude's hopped
up on touring
we're actually like this this feels like
i'm i'm cheating right now like i'm
playing default isaac
so i'm very tempted to take the alt path
i gotta be honest i'm very tempted to
take the alt path
but they didn't give me anything too
great here
so you know what i'm just gonna master
diagonal walking and i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna risk it too much we think
about bethany yeah the christmas shoes
think about the christmas shoes
okay the master of diagonal walking has
logged on
papanada this is the most um
i've ever seen conjoined in my entire
life it's it's crazy
do it for her and her is like the mental
picture that i have of
of bethany who i have not seen in
literally like
17 years
i'm so much in chat it's big
text deleted by moobot banned unbanned
like they you just got hit with like all
the infinity stones simultaneously
uh you're probably dizzy right now
sorry i missed clicked it's no problem
it's not i was going through apollo's uh
band requests or unban requests uh
earlier today
makes duty zombie juice
it makes me laugh every time man
it's just they're just such weird bands
like
a couple days ago somebody got banned
from his chat they just kept typing dumb
dog harem over and over
with no context dumb dog harem dumb dog
harem dumb dog harem
and then like they got banned and they
wrote an essay in the replies that's
like i'm sorry
i know now that what i did was not okay
but i just thought lol it'd be funny and
you're like what are you
talking about man like
people be crazy i mean maybe with the
context from the stream is not so bad i
don't know
no like i'm not trying to invite this
you got to try a little harder than that
to get banned here
we have up to the bands a little bit
just because you know i've finally given
myself permission to ban the
uh known quantities who come around to
just try to start arguments all the time
but even still we're trying like a
couple people a week
really get get permit here a couple of
people a week that are like real human
beings and not just like ascii art
i keep the mfn thing on me precisely
true
uh he's not taking any bs anymore
but i i think it's because like for
other streamers like what annoys them is
when people are rude
for me like the thing that i'll like the
cardinal sin for my
chat is when they make a joke that's
like funnier than the joke i made
and i'm like oh you think you're really
funny let's see how funny you are when
you can't talk
because i think that's hilarious what do
you think oh
silence oh cat guy your tongue
freaking buttholes man should think of
that before you
before you try making jokes in here
you look like a very huggable person
yeah i haven't been to the gym
uh since kovid broke out really so
i'm you know i'm not working on it but
it's like on the list of things to
to work on once once i get vaccinated in
freaking like 2027 or whenever like i
know i don't even know what's going to
be the limiting
factor for vaccination for me if it's
going to be that
i'm last in line because uh you know i'm
only 32
or if it's gonna be that like we don't
get the shipments or like the shipments
uh they keep putting them on paws for
you know like
concerns or if the bc government is just
never gonna actually hire
um web developers to make their websites
they keep crashing
uh or just being non-functional uh due
to the amount of traffic they're
receiving so
i don't know one of these days like is
is happening man but it's gonna be a bit
i'm just saying they need to hire like
some more bcit grads and a few less
uh sfu grads they if they get some bcit
grads in there they're gonna sort that
out right away
my points you're losing me my jury
he went off oh he's saying it
what was your lifting routine i did um
i did five three one uh
boring but big i would recommend it like
it's it's very simple
it's it's good for for building you know
strength and
and mass as long as you eat properly and
it's not like
one of the things i liked about it the
most is that it's like uncomplicated
like instead of uh you know there's
things i i forget now i was like
way into it i free there's like a
there's a reddit user
who was like really jacked and he made a
um like a plan
for basically how to get that jacked and
sons that's
it see i told you i know just enough to
to know what i don't know
i remember like looking at uh the plan
and it was like literally like when you
have like bench day
you do like 27 sets of bench pressing or
something like that i'm just like man
i can't do that that's that
that's that's for somebody that's in a
different place in their life
which is fine don't get me wrong you
know you got trade-offs uh
one way or the other 531
was that like it was at a great level
for me of
easy to follow and and showed good
results
without you know requiring too long in
the gym
i did like a three-day split so like
i would do i think i did squats
and overhead press on the same day and
then like
bench had its own day
trying now i'm like i'm way out of it
man and and deadlifting had his own day
um and the longest workout day was like
90 minutes
but it's not so bad it's it's much
better than
well much easier at least than than the
like 120 minute minimums
that's we're honest i did five by five
that's right i didn't do five three one
never mind you're absolutely right i did
five
yeah no wait oh hold on i did
five by five and then i
pivoted to five three one yeah
because i i read online i don't know how
true it is
um but i was i had done like two months
of
strong lives five by five and then uh i
read online that uh
dead lifting heavy three times a week
could cause like a compressed vertebrae
and i was like
you know what get me out of that
let's see look i i want to get in shape
but not at that cost
anyway yeah yeah it does it turns out it
does both
but anyway that's that's a long time ago
now i work out at the library
uh where i read the wall street journal
could you take some damage please
doubters have been real quiet you hate
to see it right
like i'm almost like oh oh snooze
another another win
i could use some damage though we are at
2.8 damage that's that's a little on the
low side
winds are good for morale though people
are like obvious wins resident sleeper
bro i have 2.8 damage
yeah but wow the food here is terrible
yeah what smaller portions as well
are conjoined is like is terrible
what's your fire rate yeah i haven't
learned how to like contextualize that
now because it goes from low to high
instead of high to low now
i don't know what happened the doors
just opened up because i took too long
oh let's go it's something it's not
it it's good quality of life very
helpful
that's shots per second now like like
tails from
sonic the hedgehog by the way did you
know
sonic the hedgehog too i don't mean to
flex
filming right now in downtown vancouver
you guys want anything
to say i i can pass on a message maybe
to sonic or to james marsden
i uh no spoilers i haven't seen the
first one so i don't know if james
marsden dies in the first one
do you know jim carrey yeah we we hang
out at the same
uh facebook groups
dude that's absolutely don't even talk
to me about jim carrey i'm gonna be so
cheesed if he gets vaccinated before me
i'll never recover man like
psychologically physically i'll probably
be fine but
get ready you're gonna be upset no no no
well no i'd rather he be vaccinated
but you know i still think i mean it's
hard right like it's hard to
not see the vaccine as like a reward for
good behavior
like that's i'm like we would we did
everything right
where's our vaccine and they're like nah
the people who
you know kind of screwed it up are going
to get vaccinated first and i'm like
that makes perfect sense but i'm still
mad okay this is
eye drops tier size plus range up
okay okay
okay now down to the next floor please
minor pog
nope i refuse i refuse to take damage
here
i got vaccinated by the astrazeneca
vaccine and then they banded 30 minutes
later in my country
it's all right cause i'm saved by the
bell
when i wake up in the morning get the
alarm clock morning and you know i'm
gonna make it on time
i see the bus fly by it's sorry
sorry um it's a 24-hour ban
permanent
there's little batteries now they didn't
nerf batteries there's there's little
batteries and normal size batteries
it's all right to be a little bitty
little bitty town versus big old city
might as well sing might as well smile
life goes on for a little bitty while
randy travis
look it up sweetheart country music has
an anti-city agenda
it's actually alan jackson it might be
might be randy jackson
like little bitty town versus big old
city i know what i would choose
um but then also um
don't even get me started on on allen
jackson's gone country
the whole song is basically about how
like you know
if you live in those uh big cities like
get ready because people are gonna like
break into your house and like steal
your things but as soon as you
move to a city with like six people in
it your life's gonna be totally fine
i believe i i think there might be a
line now that i think of i think there
might be a line
in gone country about how las vegas is
full of sinners just give me one sec
okay hold on gone country
lyrics this by the way if you're new
here this is typical we do this
we do this uh from time to time
give it a sec give it give it a sec hold
on
he commutes to la but he's got a house
in the valley but the bills are piling
up and the pop
scene just ain't on the rally and he
says honey i'm a serious composer
schooled in voice and composition but
with the crime and the smog
these days this ain't no place for
children
i hate it so much oh man
that being said she's been playing a
room on the strip for 10 years in vegas
every night she looks in the mirror
and she only ages doesn't even rhyme
she's been reading about nashville
the old records everybody's buying says
i'm a simple girl myself
grew up on long island she's gone
country
i hate it man anyway it wasn't as bad as
i thought it was but
small town girl she grew up on long
island you know in like the third most
populous u.s state
no big deal nashville by the way real
small town
uh uh uh uh but we listen to country
music there so it's the country
quick quick guess population size of
nashville
900 000 in the in the metro area
confirmed or denied
i mean in the city proper not in the
metro area
700 000 back on top
sad couldn't even be bigger than
vancouver if i wanted to go country i'd
live to your largest city
how does that make you feel be nice to
get out of the hustle bustle
sorry it's too far i have nothing
against nashville
now new orleans we don't speak about
that
and you see how seamlessly we slipped
back into banter now that we're on a
guaranteed one run
oh man
everybody likes new orleans i have never
been in new orleans
incredible history of course um
my parents have been in new orleans and
they said they did not really enjoy
themselves
um because bourbon street
smelled like you know fluids
and biohazard stains and stuff like that
um
and then the other reason i have a
prejudice against it is because
the worst person in 90 day fiance
history is from
new orleans but apart from that i got
nothing against it
except isn't that the place where the
hotel just fell down
okay doubters have been real quiet
didn't like a big hotel just fall over
in new orleans in like 2017 or something
like that
that happens everywhere
i i don't think so
because then it wouldn't be news it
would be in the periodicals
the front fell off
look if you're into jazz or fried shrimp
sandwiches
both of which by the way appeal to me
go go see tiny boop squig shorterly
live at the house of blues dan aykroyd
opens
just take away the mic when he starts
talking about alien technology
what the this seems pretty good
right new character about to be unlocked
i'm not even looking at i'm glancing the
whole time can we talk about 90 days
no i haven't been watching this much of
this season
um i catch it every now and then when i
like you know i'm just chilling
i did see the i mean tlc they put out a
it was a fake season right like every
episode they were like i cannot be to
marry him
and then the next episode they're like
guess what we got married
sorry the show's always a little fake
but it was like
it was faker than usual from from what i
could glean from this season
i've seen some brandon clips dude i
brandon is who i was talking about like
a couple months ago when the season
started
i was laughing that he was talking uh
with his mom about how like he and his
fiance don't use contraception
and then like his mom made an
appointment at the doctor for
his fiancee to get some birth control uh
and he was just in the back of the car
on the drive there playing his nintendo
switch
come on man
you're setting gamers back like like 30
years with this portrayal
like you're you're you're a 26 year old
adult you're about to get married and
mom made your doctor's appointment for
your fiance and is driving her to the
the doctor's office while you're playing
animal crossing back there
you're not ready to have a kid man
oh it's true it was like february 2020
so it's not uh
it was not animal crossing he's probably
playing breath of the wild
he's probably a speed runner
[Laughter]
anyway they got married because you know
every episode you know
they have a huge problem i don't know if
the wedding's gonna happen next episode
we're married
i mean i guess that's what happens when
you only have 90 days right like if you
if you have like a big argument it's not
like you can really put it off
i do feel like a couple of the couples
got a little screwed like
because like they had major fights but
it was in the middle of like the first
coveted lockdown so they're like you
can't even leave
so like your only options were like get
married or go to jail
which is you know
it's a tough decision i guess
i think some of them made the wrong one
but
the show is called 90 day fiance it's uh
must watch television it was recently
ranked by tv guide as the best show in
television history
much better than one piece or my hero
academia
or uh a tank on titan the final season
really for real this time
we promise pinky swear unless the
ratings are good
no deal with the devil this is what dude
it's a long run or maybe i'm just
i've been streaming for a while that's
possible too
could not be more wrong wait a minute
hold on this appeals to me
24-hour ban permanent have you seen
marriage or mortgage i have not
but this sounds like a show that might
be a little bit up my alley
that show is great hold on hold on
marriage or mortgage tv program
how much of the show's actually scripted
a wedding planner and a real estate
agent
compete to win the hearts and budgets of
couples who must
choose between a fairytale wedding and a
dream home
so is oh but they're real couples
so it's not like because what i was
thinking
was like it was like the bachelor but at
the end of the show
the guy could choose the girl
or the house and i was like that guy's
getting some equity
yeah wait a minute hold on why would you
ever
and i understand where i'm going with
this like just work with me for a second
if you get the choice between your dream
home and your dream wedding
and you don't snap pick
the dream home you are a fool they're
not giving out
homes for a hundred bucks down at city
hall
you know these are not two life events
that are created equal in terms of the
financial cost
they still have to pay for the home what
is then what is the
what's the show
i don't assume they would give them a
house they give them a five percent down
payment
and closing costs okay like that's not
nothing
but i can't help but feel like they
couldn't even up it to 20
like the they're literally taking
advantage of like the you know lowest
interest rates in human history they
give you the 5
down payment and the maximum monthly
mortgage payment that's
insane
there you go just just choose a billion
dollar home yeah you could just live in
notch's house
with the candy room and everything
okay hold on the emperor card
doubters are on notice right now
we finish this floor
we beat both bosses we use the emperor
card
we finish the cathedral instantly we go
to the chest
and we get a good item and then we win
the run it's that simple
bethany i can already see you you're a
fine girl
what a good run you would be
we have an orbital emperor is still
better though
i can't read the comment but it's it
seems to explain some of the k
fabe with um
with marriage or mortgage i didn't know
this was on netflix like i
i have been pretty hard on netflix
recently
i might give one episode of uh
of marriage or mortgage a chance
i'll give it a shot
it's not like there's anything else what
are they making the kings gambit
i don't think so
you'll get mad that's for sure i mean
that's pretty much what i'm looking for
i i have indeed seen the some of the
american seasons of uh
married at first sight i think sips was
talking about it on
on monday it's a it's a truly
like flabbergasting show
it's you know like how on
we used to rag on tiny house shows
because you know they'd be like i want
to live in a tiny house and then when
every house they got shown they'd be
like it's a little tight
in here yeah yeah i want a tiny house uh
but by the way i also want to have a
full king-sized california bed
and you're like can't be done it's got
everything i'm looking for but it
doesn't have my california king bed
that's because it's a tiny house madam
we we couldn't figure tennis courts in
here either i'm sorry to tell you but
um it's married at first sight is kind
of like that
where like they're so gleefully ignorant
they're like why doesn't everybody just
get married like on a tv show at first
sight without even knowing
like anything about the person they're
gonna get married to it's so easy
forehead and then like a week later
they're like i hate you
and i never wanna see you again
like there's they're always so confident
that they've made the right decision
and like everybody else is a dummy and
then they have like one
argument and they're like i want you to
die and i'm like that's why most people
don't
like actively pursue marrying a stranger
on television dummy
i love it when the friends are roasting
the spouse
is just it's a bad dynamic for sure i
mean like
why do you think people put so much you
know care and work and time into
choosing their
spouse you know it's if you could just
like walk into the store and then you
know
be like oh you know what can i do i'm
just looking for anything you know
it's just crazy
government mandated spouse i mean it's
just crazy man
don't even get me started i had to i
raged quit it doesn't happen that much
because i i love watching tv shows that
make me mad
the television program on netflix uh
indian matchmaking made me so mad i
couldn't watch it anymore
like i can tolerate watching almost
anything
and like we finished one episode of that
and then
we just let a second one autoplay and i
was like i hate this
and then we almost let it like kate
didn't pick up the remote after the
second episode
so it started playing and i was like if
you don't mind i'm going to turn this
off cause i hate it
like it's i'm not normally that strong
with my diction
but i was like it just
so many of the ladies on that show were
were like
they were so rude like it was too much
for me
there's one lady on the show i forget
her name but her
brain is like her dialogue is seared
into my brain
i think she was named like aparna or
something like that
and she was going out on these cool
dates with these guys who were like you
know
really trying their hardest and had
things like go they had they were
professionals and
stuff like that and then like the one
guy was a podcaster
and uh she was like you know i don't
really respect him i
don't think i could respect a man that
like he works at a job like that
i was like what the hell are you talking
i looked him up on twitter
he had like you know 60 000 followers on
twitter or something like that
and he was just laying into her like
nicely
but you know it was she was terrible man
the show made me so upset
and it wasn't like inconsolable but i
was just like i
don't wish this lady the best i don't
wish her the worst but i certainly do
not actively give her my well wishes
no it's not on site on site i would like
you know i would be like oh hey that's
that
nasty lady from uh indian matchmaking
let's cross the street she's my lawyer
and she's not very friendly in real life
either how did that
happen
but isn't that that's kind of what you
want out of a lawyer right
well i don't know is are you are you
being charged with the crime or are you
taking someone to small claims court
if you've been charged with a crime i
don't know if that's the energy you want
but if you're trying to
extort a local business maybe
i mean i don't again like and this
sounds rude right like
but i don't really care if she's nice as
a lawyer but like when she's like going
on blind dates
and also wondering like why she's still
single despite being like
you know a woman in her mid-30s with a
stable career
i'm like you know maybe you should turn
the lens of introspection on
for a second and realize that you're
based on the tv show you're just kind of
unpleasant to be around quite frankly
because your standards are so high
versus like what you're bringing to the
table
you've unlocked bethany he's done it
some
dude we should do some challenges on
this stream too i just ignored the deal
with the devil
not not a wise play but
rise up believers
anyway that's oh new new animation um
it's a pretty cool item now
hold on i just realized that all of our
familiars have become orbitals thanks to
friend necklace
that's actually pretty sweet
anyway long story short that's like one
of the only shows of my life i've ever
i've ever raged quit
otherwise when a show like makes me mad
i usually feel good
it's like a release
that one though i was just like they
should cancel the series because this
lady's just
she's just too rude
horse only has two charges it's a dream
come true
i hate all that did i tell you i
understand
i mean i don't know do you call me a
homeowner i am making payments on a home
but
the vast majority of it still belongs to
the bank but um
either way you know it's i don't know if
that's does a homeowner own their house
or is it just someone who's working to
own their house anyway solidarity or
whatever
um but there's this show i for it's on
hgt
tv and it takes place in the south i
don't remember what the name of it is
it's called
like simple home or something like that
sweet home
and i just remember being like so mad
while i was watching it because they did
this episode where like these two
brothers
hometown that's it these two brothers
we're like hey we wanna like buy a new
location for our restaurant
oh you're still alive and then
she showed them like two different
places and then they were like okay
which one are you gonna get
and then they said we've decided and
then they went to a commercial break
then they came back
recapped and we're like we've decided to
just
buy both of them and i i turned it off
because i was like quit bragging
now that's a room right there
i was watching to see if you were gonna
go with the
the oh the old colonial house that's a
little bit of a fixer-upper but it's in
a nice part of town or if you were going
to go with the ultra modern
open kitchen concept and instead you're
like oh we've decided to just buy both
because you know money's no object
you you remove the conceit
just by both forehead
just uh be dead not not the guys i mean
this enemy
i need you to be dead so that i can win
this run and play as the new character
i'm trying to be rich and frivolous one
of these days i mean it's ambitious
don't get me wrong
it's just on tv on a tv show like
that like
you know i mean hgtv is just kind of
like it's in a weird spot
for me right like i can't pretend like
that i'd
you know i'm like living out of a
shoebox or whatever but at the same time
i'm like
you know the housing crisis is one of
the eminent issues facing my generation
and then hgtv
is like we like them both so we just we
just decided to like buy both of them
and then like take double the supply
necessary off the
off the uh market just just because i
like them just because like i think i
i really like the the awning on this one
is really good and then the other one
seems nice to live in
anyway
it's their right don't get me wrong
they're not doing anything like
illegal just kind of like you know kind
of like be quiet about it just think
they're neat
were they in vancouver no they wish
sorry that was really though like
look screw that man
pinky eye we'll take it
they they'd gone country let's put it
that way
there was an episode of of i don't
remember if it was loved or listed
or if it was house hunters but there was
an episode of
house hunters or love it or listed
vancouver that had a streamer on it
i am not joking because my mom watches
all those shows
she was like she took a photo of her tv
set this was like five years ago
and was like check it out there's a
streamer on here
no it was not me um
but it was like an an og streamer
youtuber it was
i think it was oh what's his name
i think it was justra
who i think lives in vancouver
i think he like he's involved with
monster cat as well like he might be uh
like a co-founder of monster cat or
something like that
i was like that's a little spicy man
you're a streamer and you're like
they're showing photos of your house on
the television
then again i think the the overlap
between like
internet trolls and uh people that watch
hgtv is probably a little on the low
side
i imagine
no i didn't i've never seen the episode
my mom watched it though
well you know next time i i see my mom
i'll ask her i'll be like hey
what else did they end up going with on
that show and they'll be like
he bought both and i'll be like
put the cookie down
how long is a long run man i mean i've
heard of long
runs before but this run is long i'll
tell you
i never get no respect this run is so
long
it's it it it's so long if you
ran it you would have run a marathon and
never get any respect
sorry sorry i gotta work on the punch
line a little bit
where's the boss dude
i'm i'm a big fan of two charge white
pony no no doubt about that
you know what i uh miss
i miss when the food network with shows
where people cooked but they weren't in
competition with one another
like when they used they used to have a
show i mean jamie oliver
was one of them obviously as well and
you know but like
you know giada at home nigella lawson at
home etc etc
now they're always fighting man i
thought food was supposed to bring us
together
donkey donkey dunky dunky we've won
uh slash marker repentance



all right new character new year new me
what the heck does the book of virtues
do
she gets a cool little fly followed by a
cool little fly
wait a minute was this uh
character in
she gets the spirit hearts and the
spirit hearts
become flies because she can't actually
get hp
okay i recall now but that was it like
double tap
shoots fire or am i now i'm getting it
confused with like fiend folio or
something like that
the bones are her money and so are the
fires
not your tinnitus by the way that this
is uh is merely the sound of the vacuum
cleaner
three bombs how come your mom lets you
have three bombs
they pull your hair up but not out
to turn into a man and have another
chance at life
but i love the sauce he puts on the end
of it man
but if they pull it out they turn to
bones
oh
how does one bet he's losing this one
for sure
it's a hot tip it's a sure thing
yeah that's i'll use netflix again
when they uh put out i think you should
leave season two man
they've really been dragging their heels
because like it hadn't been completed
yet
lazy
not a good use of a bomb for the record
by the way i'll tell you right off the
bat i don't think we're doing um
alt path we'll see what our first items
are but
this seems a little weak right off the
bat
but if we get the relic
dude that would be sick i would do some
fortnite duos with tim robinson
i think tim robinson could see the humor
in the alien xenomorph
from uh ridley scott's 1977
sci-fi thriller alien doing uh
the turk dance from scrubs i think
uh i think he would find that hilarious
have you seen this it's hilarious
it said it was uploaded at 6am today it
has one view
have you seen it
it's actually from 1979 you appear to
have it confused with the smashing
pumpkin song
of the same year
he's done it okay
speed not what i'm looking for
not what i'm looking for come on man
no bet because i forgot
current poll one run you i'll
uh you know it might compromise the
integrity of the bet but you you could
reopen the tables if you want
i would allow it it's uh you know you're
early here
don't steal my charge man
this is not gonna compromise the
integrity too much
oh i just realized if we win as this
character we're gonna get
new items unlocked right well probably
the book of virtues first but
we're back on the hunt
what's going on youtube we're back
hunting the book of virg using the
binding of isaac repentance
wow i don't know what this character
is australian children's pokemon go
youtuber i guess
is the character
something like that
look i never had a choice
that's not australian what are you
talking about i'm really feeling it
that's australian man
just because they're not presently
snowboarding
doesn't mean they're not australian
hey nl that's not cool australians do
lots of other things like
not just snowboarding uh they surf as
well
believers keep your wallet in your
pocket i'm not sure about this one right
now
well it's been a while since i
referenced that uh tick tock that i
stole from shibley
why cook saucies might win it
earth to do it for you mate
thank you for the hp much appreciated
it's so good
it's a great uh a great tick tock i
couldn't agree more
what the there's an an enemy remains
how much garbage juice is too much
garbage juice
toasty are you okay what is what does it
mean what does this mean how much
garbage juice is too much garbage juice
is it a reference to a tick tock i'm not
familiar with
what the what the
not sure i'm just feeding coal into the
banter engine
well i mean like any amount of garbage
juice is too much garbage juices like
garbage juice is like it's the liquid
garbage right we're not talking about
like when you mix a bunch of sodas
together at the kfc taco bell
any amount is too much i mean you
you successfully put banter into the
banter engine though i will promise you
that because
um like now i'm i can go off on a rant
about how like you know when you had
since we had the baby
i've been taking the garbage and this is
i know to skip the dishes bit but this
is real this is my real life man it's
not a joke
we've been taking the garbage and
recycling out like
i don't know six times a day
but between all the cans of sparkling
water and
and all the diapers like oh man
taking out a lot of garbage skipping the
dishes but
taking the garbage out twice a day i
really should just get a soda stream man
like i get all the the spiciness i
suppose but
you should probably just get a soda
stream yo believers rise up
turn your tears into bombs and rise up
like let me go through the the the
positives and negatives
positive of the soda stream
don't have to buy sparkling water as
often
negative of the soda stream
have to buy co2 cans occasionally
positive of the soda stream
i can buy the co2 canisters at
any uh major chain grocery store in
british columbia
negative of the sodastream i have to
resolve how i feel about the conflict
in the gaza strip apparently at least
that's what what twitch told me
positive uses a lot less aluminum than
the cans
from the bubbly
i don't know i'll have to think about it
negative
sodastream costs a lot more than a pack
of bubbly
positive maybe not in the long term
hear me out you could just drink water
from the tap uh and the nobel prize for
uh
things nobody ever thought of before
goes to your username in chat
come on man
the sponsorship though um that's true
this sponsorship though
oh so what you're saying is bubbly you
better act fast
yeah bubbly better act fast
otherwise i could be going going gone
yo thank you tree no tea
biggie not tree biggie that's groot
thank you for the gifted subs thank you
i don't know i have to think about it
the other thing is
the bubbly takes up a lot of space in
the fridge
however the soda stream would take up a
lot of space in the
on the counter and we got a real counter
based dearth of real estate right now
what a dodge
he's a genius like we got
an instant pot we got
uh the air fryer coffee grinder
baby food warmer upper
baby bottle warmer upper there's a lot
of stuff on the counter right now
counter space is at a serious premium i
might have to stick with the bubbly but
don't let them know that
rice cooker you're absolutely right we
also have a a hot water heater so we get
instantly dispensed
uh hot water for teas
counter is is quite full honestly the
counter doesn't even have space for the
toaster
i have to drag the toaster out from from
appliance jail every time i want to have
toast
he's done it okay don't die
it's it's easy to die on this one
because oh we didn't matter if we picked
it up i guess oh cause we're bethany
don't care didn't ask plus you're
bethany bethany
what's wrong with me that's what happens
when you stream for eight years
start calling it library i'm dead
i actually don't know what happened
you broke the mirror
is that bad
[Laughter]
all right
seven years bad luck all right
we were on such a good run too it is
what it is i should really just keep my
stream open in a tab
like we didn't i didn't have holy mantle
or did i have holy mantle i got hit and
i didn't notice or something
don't care didn't ask plus you're dead
gift five subs
you broke the mirror you can't
of leave
even though i still have two red hearts
makes perfect sense
yo new badge just dropped i got a sub
gifter badge
how about that
dodged no we we'll do challenges
eventually
we like within this stream but for now
we got to do
uh we got to get bethany work in here
man we got to do something
the first two challenges are bethany
challenges okay so i'll skip those
all right we're good to go
corey did you stay up until midnight to
play this
oh wait that's when you normally
eat breakfast probably
[Laughter]
got him what does bethany do not
uh much what's up with you
she uh every once in a while she takes
her spirit hearts and turns them into
blue dots that hit an enemy once and
then break
thank you to whoever just sent me a uh a
sodastream picture on twitch much
appreciated thank you for the sodastream
picture
on twitch or on twitter i should say it
is it is quite small
i can't dispute that i'm looking at it
out of my peripheral vision right now
it is not a large um
appliance but even still i got to tell
you we're very limited countertop
real estate right now we'll see
we'll see i got to think about it be the
best item in the game please
okay well jesus heard my pleas
and he has uh decided to
leave me on read but you know what that
could be worth something later
we'll see
i also think like to some extent i know
how this sounds
but i think having a
soda stream would lead to me drinking
too much sparkling water
like i probably drink too much sparkling
water as is
with the bubbly but uh
i think if i got a soda stream there's
no more artificial limits like i would
never run out of cans
right eventually run out of co2 but it
you know that doesn't have
the ratio of running out of co2 versus
cans is pretty low
i think i would i would drink too much
now i don't know if it's one of those
things where drinking too much sparkling
water has any ill effects
or if it's like a it's just a persistent
myth that people are like oh your bone
density is going to go down to like zero
dude
but i don't know
i don't know
it puts bubbles in your blood i don't i
don't think so
i don't believe that
well like i don't know now i'm thinking
about it and i'm like maybe
you got me craving some sparkling water
now though
it hurts my teeth um you know
that would be the other thing i'd be
worried about is that like because it's
acidic to some extent maybe it would
have like an impact on your dental
health
but i also have like a sonicare so i
feel like those should
cancel each other out you know
i feel like one sonicare should be worth
like four cans of bubbly a day
i don't know if that's true but
i i can't believe i'm gonna dignify this
with the response why not just drink
normal water
it's just like this the simple answer is
people you know they drink sparkling
water because they like the taste of it
you know
why why why ever eat like a real meal
when instead you could just have like
you know
five soylents a day why do anything
like just say you don't like sparkling
water and move on
yeah like i get it you don't like spicy
food
oh oh garcon this water is too spicy for
me could you just get me some out of the
bathroom sink
make sure it's room temperature please i
can't handle anything that's close to
the extremes of
heat or cold
can i get like six saltines with that as
well or maybe a digestive aero root
cookie
i get it if you're not cool enough to
drink sparkling water then you know
it is what it is it's an aspirational
thing maybe one day you'll get there you
can see me in the
in the halls of valhalla drinking some
bubbly
i feel vindicated dude i listen the
water lobby is like merciless i love
water i'm drinking out of like my my
nalgene right now
filled up to the brim with some ice
cubes in it just to stay frosty
if you ever drink a type of water that's
not tap water people
they'll hit you with like an essay they
found on reddit it's crazy man
i didn't realize the anti-sparkling
water lobby
like i get it if you drink whoever
drinks sparkling water in like high
school
they're so cool they're probably like
awes
everyone there's there's mr popular and
you you hate them because of the you
know you think it's the sparkling water
that makes them so popular
but it's not the sparkling water they
don't drink
the sparkling water didn't make them
cool they're just so cool they drink
sparkling water and
you know women want them and men want to
be them it's just what
that's the prototypical bubbly consumer
you know you can you can either be
jealous or you can
get with the times i don't know what to
tell you
saved believers rise up
we've done it
i don't know at all how to play as this
character
do you supplement with electrolytes
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
i eat food every day and i think that
that that gives me enough to
you know from an ion standpoint to
you know stay safe i guess
i don't know i've never i've never
gotten hypotonic to the best of my
knowledge
but i'll keep an eye out for it
it seems like kind of a high maintenance
way to go about consuming
liquid but but what do i know
oh first he's dead drinking sparkling
water now he's eating food
my god quit bragging
what's that were you gonna buy both
houses now that was a bit from last
episode if you're not
if you weren't there for it
i feel like blind rage now makes
the invincibility after getting hit
the length that it was before
repentance which is very good for my
muscle memory
okay the fool card the fool on the hill
still got it baby back on top
i've seen this item before in anti-birth
what do you do eyesore more eyes
realize realize real lies
jaw breaker don't chew it i don't know
man i don't know what i'm looking for
but it's kind of like bloodborne isaac
you're not wrong
now you know what we need tractor beam
clip farming
if we get tractor beam right now i'll
give out a million twitch subs
if we get tractor beam on this room
one million gifted twitch subs
incoming but it has to be on this room
i'm i'm putting it all on the line
oh this is a germ a bit oh stolen
i didn't know
you leave holes in the floor
very rude
i think this run has the potential like
i don't know what a good rate of fire is
now i feel like we're a little low
um but our damage is pretty good
we have a if we don't get hit we have a
100 chance of a deal with the devil
it's kind of a spicy enemy for sure to
not get hit on but
we're doing our darndest come on come on
come on come on
he's done it was the deal with the angel
what the heck staple gun
damage up nothing wrong with that
something not kind of wrong with this um
i mean i'm a
holy holy poop people like holy poop i'm
kind of a guardian angel guy but
this is an active item right what the
what what hold on hold on
we've created mom
so every is they've fused
i don't understand how this works but
we're about to find out
i was here
so we created a boss that's normal
but what happens now does does the boss
like
hang out no it's the sa i feel like it's
just the same item
is it okay hold on i thought that they
would do
something different but maybe it's
actually just that they allow you to
have the book
and the item simultaneously
it also still gives you the spirit fire
it's kind of you know i i thought it was
gonna make like
an orbital out of a boss and i was like
this is the greatest thing
ever
i was i was i had a whole speech
prepared for the believers
and then another one for the doubters in
case one of the bosses we summoned hit
us and like it was gonna be a whole
production
the fires also shoot tears
okay so we you what you're trying to say
is we shouldn't just be throwing them
away
as terrible orbitals i understand now
i i get the picture haha underwear i get
the picture
yeah yeah
hey dude why is the joker so popular
i'm so sorry i'm so sick of the joker
like why the he's been the most popular
villain
the entire time i've been alive
first it was you know i mean uh
cesar romero like back in the 60s but
i'm talking about like within my long
lifespan
cool glitter bombs what random blast
plus five bombs okay very interesting
like i i thought it would end at some
point you know we had like
jack nicholson and it was like really
popular okay and then it was like
animated joker and i was like okay cool
and then it was heath ledger and you're
like all right that's fine
and then there was a little break and
then they're like guess what it's jared
leto now and you're like oh come on
guys like it's just getting ridiculous
like the riddler needs some love
give the riddler some love now now we
got a joaquin phoenix as well like
there's like seven
jokers simultaneously just never ends
i bet you could chart like anything you
wanted on a graph
by just charting it versus
the number of
joker cosplays you can find on youtube
it's like a it's an exponential
growth upwards if you can chart anything
against that it will prove any trend
you're trying to prove
what happened to false face man false
face is pretty cool
he wears masks and rides a motorcycle
and doesn't afraid of anything except
sometimes batman
you mean two-face no i mean false face
from the original batman
television program starring adam west
he's a bad guy who wears masks
also known as false faces
clay face his name is false face you can
look it up on
batwiki wikibadia.com
no no no no no no
he really exists yeah i mean i make very
little up
occasionally you find yourself in a
banter hole you gotta you gotta pull a
rabbit out of a hat
most of these stories come from you know
the real world
and that's all that needs to be said
you're just big horn don't care didn't
ask plus your big horn
miss me with that okay oh so we got
am i insane or do we have like a tooth
shooting
familiar now is that what's going on
with the fires there i can't follow this
like this come on have mercy this is too
much
what's happening the whole screen is
covered
what are you trying to do to me here i
can't even see what the item is
what are you they stuck with me okay
happy to have you along for the ride
uh we will not be going alt path we'll
just be going down a floor
oh it's your trinket
the trinket creates the uh
the tooth shots that makes perfect sense
you ever have a jawbreaker man
they should be illegal in my opinion
they don't taste good
you're gonna instinctively bite down on
one
and the choking risk is like is through
the roof
extremely low tier candy
i wonder if covet is going to be like
the final uh nail in the coffin for
those 25 cent jelly bean dispensers you
see at the grocery store
when you check out i never
everybody's lamenting all restaurants
and
movie theaters and travel and cruises
and stuff like that
nobody cares about the vending machines
where you can put 25 cents in
and get six little candies and you don't
even know if it's candy when you eat it
because sometimes it turns out to be gum
and you're like wait a minute oh no this
is candy this is and then you get two
seconds later and you're like ah
actually it's gum
what or the the
the weird extremely hard fruit candies
you know what i'm talking about where
the banana's good but like the
the orange explodes into powder when you
bite it
some of those are are actually pretty
sweet
like um if you can get like a cool
bouncy ball out of those
like they're made of vibranium like
vibranium and flubber
mixed together you can smash a car
window with them i think
chicken and banana exactly exactly
yeah don't don't eat that though it's
hard to tell the difference between a
bouncy ball and a jawbreaker
but you'd rather eat the ball probably
bombs
it's called a gumball machine well if it
if it serves uh
gumballs yeah
one breaks a window the other breaks
your jaw
there's something there to overthrow the
earth
their jawbreaker jawbreaker and the
brain brain
you know what i'm talking about pinky in
the brain it's the perfect opportunity
for rat jam
uh brimstone bombs
delightful
what's this guy talking about he sounds
faded uh that's fair i'm i'm like
i'm slightly faded for sure like you
could fade me
because my optimism is at an all-time
low about finding a freaking key
i would just love to experience uh you
know
it's like ten thousand bombs and also
infinite bombs when all you need is a
key
like alanis morissette said
it's just getting ridiculous man it's
like rain
on your wedding day i mean i suppose
with with golden bombs we could just
keep
blowing and blowing them up and hoping
to get like a like a glitter bomb or
something but it's
you know it's not how i saw myself
spending my launch day
ruined my devil deal chance
f got a little ambitious there i suppose
i did uh i watched on ctv news there was
a
human interest story about a young lady
and this is how you know
youtube is in um is you know you
you can do whatever you want on youtube
you know there's an audience for it
was a a lady in canada who
her her whole vibe over kovid
was releasing covid themed alanis
morissette
parodies and i gotta tell you you might
think it's very minor
she filmed like
shot for shot remake of uh
of the ironic music video playing all
four parts
lip syncing the custom lyrics to her
song like she was all in
it's pretty pog yeah it gives you
something to do at least right
it's not so bad i mean it's not as good
as an item room in a shop in a bunch of
golden chests but
and in the original old english exactly
help yep that's fair i deserve that one
i'll be honest
yeah all i did was gain 15 pounds and
have a baby
i could have been making uh all sorts of
uh
like parodies of sloan songs or
something like that
she was under vast if that's a
word i know it's not cause i looked it
up
thank you thank you thank you for the
rant jams appreciate it
you know what did i think was gonna
happen
can we get another slint reference the
streamer
gave another slim reference he thought
long and hard
about the tracks from the five-track
album
he hadn't referenced before losing his
self-confidence
in the middle of making the bit
scream scream scream
scream something like that
i mean it's not it's not my favorite bit
but something along those lines
i i do enjoy i do enjoy the
noise it's true it's so melodious really
gets the people going
a key please weird bit do not get it
uh so put the baby metal on pause for a
little bit
i want to regale you with a story of a
little math rock band from texas called
slint their entire discography
is very easy to listen to it's like six
songs and then they broke up because
they were like 14 years old and went
their separate ways
it's called uh spiderland sweetheart and
you don't even need to listen to the
whole album until you get the vibe
you can just listen to track one and
also the final track it'll give you the
gist of it
okay now what happens if you mash two
books together
it's a super book
i don't know what's happening but i'm
kind of with it
did ryan listen to the new echo 2k
chip i i don't know what music you
listen to
but i have to in my head it's just the
katamari soundtrack over and over
or like um lovely planet or something
[Applause]
or like the go team do you like the go
team you feel like
to me the vibe i get from talking to you
is like you would be a go
team kind of individual
basically like any song that sounds like
it's from the sega dreamcast
yes sir
and now that item is useless
yep you're not wrong huh
yeah okay fair enough
[Laughter]
i guess we'll go back and get the boss
the wisps are a little different yeah
the wisps are doing some new stuff but
i i don't like that these guys are like
out here
like trying to take shots at me
i guess if we had a full charge it'd be
better but like i don't know
i'd rather just find an item that is
like i mean it's kind of a false dilemma
but i'd rather find an item that has
just like a one or two room charge to
begin with
they they used to be everywhere they
used to be everywhere in the game
you couldn't shake a stick without them
being like here's lemon mishap
thank you uh isaac's room uh black
market incoming confirmed black market
incoming
the trinket is useless yeah it's useless
right now
once we get a good item an item that
fits the bill
we're all going to be sorry i meant
we're all gonna be happy
i meant we're all gonna be happy not
sorry
no this is the this is the right game
plan
stop calling me a boomer man here's the
thing i actually think i've uh
well like we have a zoomer here like the
the king of the zoomers chibly is here
chibly tell the people that i'm not
that much of a boomer if anything
i'm probably i've got more of a zoomer
energy than most of the people in chat
the only difference is i'm not regularly
sad
and have it on display on main i keep
those feelings to myself
which is not very gen z but apart from
that
i think i got the vibe pretty much down
chibly could you weigh in please
yes sir
um okay just give it a sec no pressure
he said you're a very understanding
boomer i'm i am a self-aware boomer in
that sense
like sometimes chibly will make like a
joke
about stocks and then i'll just write
like 30 lines about like when
upcoming like earnings calls are
happening and he won't reply at all
i'm pretty sure that in his head he's
like he doesn't know that i was joking
and i'm like in my head i'm like i knew
he was joking
i just wanted to talk about stocks
nobody wants to talk about him with me
so when i get even the slightest
opportunity to
to discuss them i i go i get too
enthusiastic
you know i i definitely picked up on the
vibe that we're not on the same
wavelength in the conversation
and i said that's a sacrifice i'm
willing to make
okay somehow we're still alive
[Laughter]
i don't believe it
strong melee vibes milly means
millennial oh hell yeah dude
i'll take that
it's messed up dude millennials are like
we're turning 40.
i don't even know what what is the okay
so let me put this when i when i think
of like gen
x i always think of like uh
sarcasm and like complaining that
they're wedged between
two generations that get more attention
and like even though they grew up in the
era of like you know some of the
greatest music
they're like you know oh our life sucks
because
daria got cancelled or whatever like
they they go freaking crazy for uh buffy
the vampire slayer
like that that's the vibe i get from gen
x okay
zoomers it's like um
you as a zoomer and this is negative
it's gonna cause some drama in chat i
apologize
um zoomer is like you can't ever say
that you like anything
unless you have an encyclopedic
knowledge of like
absolutely everything tangentially
related to the thing that you just said
you liked and what they've ever done and
said in their entire life
like oh not nl saying he likes good eats
uh by alton brown without realizing that
alton brown
eight years ago gave an instagram live
where he
you know said that he something
something you know
and then
i don't know like the boomer jokes make
themselves but i don't
understand like what's the millennial
vibe you know
like i know as from being inside the
bubble
no you can't say depression gen z
already took that
fake authenticity outdated memes
harry potter okay harry potter that's
bang on i'll give you that one no doubt
yes sir
overeducated underemployed okay
definitely seems apt as well can't deny
that one
like literally i i think i only have
like five friends
and i know like 30 people with phds
the ratio is all fricked up there's no
doubt about that
i don't know the other millennial vibes
yet though like i don't know if
we've gotten there
i feel like millennials are like
food photographers
like let's see when i think of
millennials and i try to put myself
outside of the
generation they're like the generation
that gets a big old you know what for
taking photos of food
the zoomers still take photos of their
food i don't know
my parents they i don't think they've
ever taken a photo of food they didn't
make
zoomers consider it cringe you know what
i don't disagree with the zoomers
i i've been known to consort with some
food photographers
i you know it's not a big deal i i'd go
sure i'll wait to take a bite until you
take a photo
but uh i you know
got out of the habit of doing it myself
time to do some adulting i think we got
made fun of enough for that that it
stopped
now it's that i'll admit that's
embarrassing for sure
i don't know the other millennial
tendencies though
i don't know i guess i gotta like ask uh
i i gotta get a good picture of it
both generations love the joker that's
that's where we come together
i can't believe we didn't get hit there
i also can't believe we've been on this
run for two hours it's oh
20 minutes
i don't know is people in chatter saying
zoomer energy is calling everything
cringe
i don't know if that's true i feel like
most of the time i
i see someone calling
uh something cringe it's like someone my
age that cares too much about what
people think of them
but i might be wrong i don't know
i mean you know i'm just this is one
man's experience
it's also it's kind of hard to like draw
the line because if you were like what's
millennial energy
like 15 years ago when a lot of
millennials were still in like high
school
they'd be like listening to fallout boy
that's the number one thing
you know a lot of so the older zoomers
are like in their early 20s right but
you know some of zoomer culture is like
you know you're kind of like picking up
on observations of somebody that's still
a
child
you best believe it's on site wait in
the good way or in the bad way
wait neither way please
stop stop i was glancing
honestly dividing people by generation
is very stupid
you know what you're right that is a
great caricature of what a millennial
would say
a little bit of gen x energy in there as
well
100 confirmed not boomer or gen z
both generations convinced that they are
faultless
okay we're doing great stuff here
13.5 chance of a deal with the devil i'm
not gonna worry about that right now
we're just gonna kick some bombs in
there on occasion
we're gonna enjoy life
range up hold on wait hold on there's a
library back here
why didn't you tell me
nobody told me there was a freaking
library back there
you only have one key a library only
costs one
key
this isn't a train wreck but it it's
kind of like in the vicinity
i think we have one damage upgrade
no well i don't know the people said
synrobes got nerfed
we had stapler stapler's a damage
upgrade
pick up key what do you mean
okay hold on we gotta hydrate while we
think here
this is a painful room you start with
book of shadows
you begin with book of shadows
you turn it on you get bookworm now
we're talking
we leave with satanic bible
although because we can't get demon
hearts
actually we leave
with book of shadows
i'm stupid because book of shadows has a
smaller charge
what the heck just happened
[Laughter]
oh maybe that was the the satanic bible
wisp
oh dude we got a brimstone wisp that's
pretty cool
i don't know maybe we'll stick with it
do you think that brimstone wisp is from
satanic bible
that seems pretty good
no you already had it ah whatever
nevertheless
moving on
hp i'm more of a worcester man myself
but i can get you know the mark of me
not being proud of the dinner that i've
cooked
is when i serve it with hp sauce
like i i gotta be honest though i i for
hello fresh
i cooked uh some turkey meatloaf like
two nights ago
i didn't think it was very good well
before i tasted it before i tasted it i
didn't think it was very good
i put a bunch of hp sauce on it ate it
and i was like this is actually
delicious it didn't even need the sauce
i was i was embarrassed in my lack of
confidence i had a
a doubter energy
oh we've already found the second secret
room
i had a doubter energy on my own dinner
hp sauce i don't know it's like a tangy
um
pseudo barbecue sauce from the united
kingdom
jesse what are you talking about you
don't know hp sauce
it's pretty good i guess yeah i don't
know if it's the same as
brown sauce but it is uh
we broke the tinted rock over there but
it
is uh good
i support it it is brown sauce
yeah i would say it's not the same as
like a1 it's
they're they're in the same genre
without a doubt but
but they're they're cousins rather than
siblings
that's all right i'm i don't need that
item but wait
but wait it's got a small charge
yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know man
let's just give it a try
i don't even i don't know how any of
this works dude
i'm just i'm flying by the seat of my
pants
are you gonna give me some cool wisps
i mean i do i've got like a what the
heck
i don't know what happened wait maybe
hold on did they change the way
that uh this item works
like maybe it hurts you to use
no i just got hit all right fair enough
duly noted it did not create a lost
do it again i don't know what's
happening
it seems to be working though we got we
got some momentum here
yeah we need unicorn stump man
excuse me oh that was a random bomb
double decker crawl space still full of
pure garbage
frick
two floors of trash gaming will never
be the same sorry sorry the run's just
taking it out of me okay
just i just need some damage man
i'm losing my mind
i'm a man of contradictions right now
the only way i get damage is by having a
full charge but i
the only way i'd see what the new
character does is by using my charge
you know one of the biggest buffs in
this game is
uh mom's heart spawning the eyes like a
second after you walk into the room i've
taken contact
damage to them almost every time i'm
embarrassed
you swore a lot in the older isaac vids
it's true
i also used to poop my pants when i was
a little kid but you know what
times have changed we're living in the
21st century now
keeping it clean i thought we could
sneak through there come on man
you've unlocked whisper baby first
unlock
ladies and gentlemen we got him
don't swear
what do you think about the new stat bar
i think
that uh smaller hud is a great addition
no doubt i still need to
understand what the like the new rate of
fire is like but
like what makes a good like what's a
good stat what's a bad stand etc
etc but
no yeah like we know it's shot per
second but i don't know like what's a
good amount of shots per second like
obviously the higher the better but
i mean like sure shots per second is
like is nice but it's not as intuitive
as being like oh my fire rate is uh an
abstract
three
an off-course gentleman's handy even
okay you gotta go
doubters assemble doubters
should lose on this one uh like
you know it's a hard game and the dlc
has made it harder for sure
however this is certainly a winnable run
if we lose it i lay it at the altar of
my own feet
oh drake thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you thanks poppy
i was in mouth chat the other day and
someone said
mouth can you name a single drake song
and it got me thinking
i can but i think i can only name
two hotline bling
and uh god's plan
that's all i know
i don't i don't think i like i mean i
probably heard
i i know his voice i don't think i know
the other
the names of the other songs though
yeah is the six something like it's an
album views from the six
right that guy was chilling on top of
the freaking cn tower
must be nice
you're you know what you're right i do
know the one that goes i left
something a ride for something
put it all together that's the way
you're something something
that's a that's a pretty catchy one
that's all i know though man
were you a degrassi fan no i was like
the the new degrassi
was a little like
it started airing right at the tail end
of my
high school career i think and when
you're at the end of like
high school you're like i don't want to
watch a show about high school that's
for middle schoolers
i want to watch a show about college or
like a
doctor's or like what about a guy who
got like the entire layout of the prison
tattooed on his body
you know grown-up stuff
i still don't get prison break i gotta
ask malf about it sometimes
like didn't he break out of the prison
in season one or two
like what what did the show do after
that like i remember i used
in season one i would see clips and be
like yo
that looks cool i wonder if they're
gonna get out of the prison and then
they were like you know on season three
of prison break and they were just like
in the woods and i'm like
seems like you've kind of hit your
logical end point
okay we have unlocked another item
they went to a different prison really
okay we unlocked the book of virtues top
left item
f we got two luck there's a chance down
here
yeah they should have done it like
american horror story like a different
prison
every season
they break out a
they could break out a freaking gitmo
that could be the series finale
but don't worry he's he's in there by
accident like what he didn't do any bad
stuff
break out a github no that's impossible
they're owned by microsoft now
i don't know what that's supposed to
mean it is true though okay that's a
good item
yeah what if they were in a prison
that was too big to tattoo on their
whole body
that could that could have been the
gimmick of a season man
they they they ruined it this prison's
too big to tattoo on your back and your
front
okay don't kill me please i've come a
long way here
it's like you know when a show's got a
logical endpoint like that you gotta
respect it
like when dexter finished his lab they
were like okay it's not dexter's lab
anymore it's just called dexter
i respect that
that was a little spicy
you know you gotta you got to evolve
with the times
yo did you see that viral marshawn lynch
video that was going around yesterday
it's so good
i think i i don't know that much about
marshawn lynch but i feel like he might
be the coolest guy on the planet
when he's at the applebee's and he's
like i love the ambiance i love the
decor
i can't decide which one i love more the
ambiance of the decor
they let me pour my own drinks if you
feel so powerful
it's so good
he goes to dave and buster's and they're
like you know
marshawn says he loves dave and buster's
because it reminds him of his two
favorite people
buster douglas and dave concepcion
you're like what the heck are you this
guy he's playing the whole
he's putting the whole system on trial
when keeping it cool goes right this is
a heck of a room
is he pranking us you talking about
marshawn lynch are you talking about me
because i'm really
i'm doing my best
this is this is pretty tight here man
i'm really trying
i don't want to use my my spacebar item
because uh
yikes yikes uh
by not using it we have an all stats up
guess i'll die that like
that run was impossible
i don't know what you want from me on
that one i
i felt like we went almost the entire
run without getting like a
single stat increase is



all right let's do some challenges man
here we are it's been a good stream so
far
oh so what he's did this week oh yeah
easily
all these easy okay here we go we've got
pika run
scat man and bloody mary
he's poop let's see so we got nine volts
chocolate bar and
many uh poop bombs i see that we have
many poop bombs oh when we poop
we create a little dips okay so we need
to
dodge this is my take on the subject
we need to dodge great great start and
let our dips do the talking
the master of walking diagonally has
logged on
whatever it's worth it
i work at dave and busters and you're
100 correct it's just crazy man like
we gotta chat let's get together and
like open an arcade
because like i i gotta grade it you put
the money up for it i'll be the
ceo um cause like
when you run an arcade you buy the
arcade machine i don't know how much
could it like a daytona usa
cabinet cost like maybe like five or ten
grand
you charge you a dollar a play forever
people will play daytona usa until the
end of time
and i don't know much about electronics
but i'm pretty sure they never go bad so
how bad could the overhead be
i wouldn't even be a silent partner at
an arcade to be honest
yeah because you you can't be a silent
anything in an arcade have you ever been
in one
people baby
you can't hear yourself think it's crazy
in there which is why it's such a good
business
it overrides your judgment centers
and uh you guys come on here
come on you can't think and all of a
sudden you're paying five bucks to play
a game that you could buy on the console
for like
you know 75 cents
joker yeah surely these couldn't
be useless let's just take them all
mom's knife
mom's knife i'm dead i'm stupid okay
restart sorry i went
that was my old muscle memory for deals
with the devil where they never
dynamically changed their pricing
i would say get used to it because i'm
sure we're going to do that a lot over
the course of early repentance
especially
it's a shame that that mom's knife was
really gonna tie that run together
incredible play incredible play
oh that's right sorry gift these gifties
okay hold on
i'm not gonna skimp on the gifties i
just need to dodge for another 10
minutes while these enemies uh
you know very very slowly choose that
it's not worth it and just let me pass
you know what we can do stay safe and
then
drop one of these over here there you go
okay
it is what it is me you live by the
sword you die by the sword
hard to be a streamer that's like we've
given out like 20 gift subs today
it's crazy you also heal from poops
how about that like got the badge though
got the badge though
i will say i'm very impressed with the
difficulty of of
uh repentance nothing on this run has
has come easily that's for sure
well there goes that eternal heart
i do think you know i wouldn't want to
be part of an arcade i think
i do i just don't believe in the
business
now if there's if they're opening bullet
ball parlors
now we're talking
you can just walk into normal enemies
believers
you can just walk in but you heal from
poops
oh so you just oh
so you can't lose
you can just walk into them
you run into enemies take damage but
turn them into poops that heal you
air go you get back to full health
seems a little uh resinous to me
but what do i know
i'm bad at games everybody knew that
already though
poggy tears upgrade getting all the good
items when we can't even use them
hello josh josh you want to open like an
arcade together
think very carefully before you answer
this question
this will kill us right am i stupid
not stupid it would be funny but just
don't mess with it man
he said yes okay well see i just
like i said i don't believe in the
business model i'm out
confirmed bad idea
i can hear him in my head okay dude f
me i guess no no it's cool
gone but not forgotten
oh now we're talking f me i guess see
the decor the ambiance
i don't think i've ever been to an
applebee's i know they're like not all
that but i'd like to at least be able to
form my own opinion
rather than you know just relying on
knowing that they're not that good
i'll take you to one all right but i
like i want to do the ultimate trash
applebee's like i don't want
to be like you know i'll get the prime
rib dinner i want to get like the five
dollar unlimited appetizers or whatever
what did we go to in niagara falls that
was basically an applebee's
really that was a tony roma's i thought
tony roma's was a classy place
you might remember that it's tony roma's
by the way because i believe you asked
the waitress if tony was working today
to which she replied uh no and then i
believe a second later she said
i think he died
like a long time ago um
so this this run goes out to tony roma f
in chat for tony roma
gone but not forgotten
f f f f in chat you hate to see it
this is the roma it's called the tony
roma
it is the place where you go it's the
place
you go when you die
you know that one
i don't know now you've got in my head
you've got i don't even know what tony
roma looks like so in my head it's just
papa john
and he's doing forever
symbol over his chest i i i
hate my brain man i don't know if it's
ever gonna get back to normal
it's so i just uh it's just papa john in
my head
doing doing the yo bombay gesture
it's bad man it's bad stuff
but it it is kind of funny as well
you gotta admit there's some humor
anyway i know i wouldn't want to open an
arcade
here's a question for you chad if you
had if you had and
this not for not for pleasure just for
profit if you had
infinite money but you had to like
brewster's millions spend it on
opening a a kind of business what
business would you open
i still feel like america
has a lack of a national
insanely popular bubble tea chain
i should not just be walking into you
that's my bed i know there's some
and particularly in the big cities but i
still think there's space
for for a company to americanize bubble
tea
to the extent that it can survive in
like you know right next they could have
a location right next to the baseball
hall of fame
i believe in i believe in the business
you know bubble tea might be a fad but
it's not a fad here
it's been it's been popping for like a
decade
i don't know if it's getting more
popular but they're open in more places
so
either it's getting more popular or
they're like insanely bad
business i guess
and here's how i i respect it i don't
even like bubble tea really
like it's uh i
i i almost don't get it like it's sweet
so what you know
that don't impress me much
but even still i know what's good for me
so when i'm out on the walk with the
baby
you best believe there's about a 30
chance i'm coming home with a
winter melon tea with pearls
let's go
winter melon is street cred i do like
the winter melon has like a little
bitterness to it
if if i were to drink more bubble tea it
would be winter melon probably
or cookies and cream
uh i've never had boba is it good it's
good
for sure yeah i mean like it it tastes
good
it's sweet you know
it it it it's not it's not that
compelling to me but it it
the flavor is good like it appeals to
your your
you know lizard brain for sure
what would you call the the bubble tea
chain that's a great question
i'm a big believer in a name but i think
everybody that
we know is like they get the name
meta all wrong i don't think you need to
have a
pun i think you just need the name to be
snappy
like is there a famous chain restaurant
in america
that is wordplay i can't think of one
wendy's like when when these chicken
strips getting inside of my mouth
oh my order's up right now is that is
that the word play
chick-fil-a that's not word play in my
opinion that's like
i i don't even
under it it is what because
but it's not like they could have called
it chick
fillet it wouldn't have been word like
it's not it
there's no punch line they just spelled
the word wrong
you know what i mean
as like a joke unless did it start in
like philadelphia or something
or or the fillmore district in atlanta
like i don't get it
i don't get it okay hooters that's a
i'll allow that that's a real answer
but i my my point i suppose is merely
that they're few and far between
i think everyone always looks for a pun
you want to call a bubble tea place you
know something
that'll get the people going something
easy to remember
so i would call my bubble tea place
mcdonald's
but with an a in between the m and the c
yeah yeah that's the ticket
we just spelled the word wrong exactly
exactly man that's taken nah
only if they sue me
call it rye abs nobody wants to get
bubble
tea at a place called rehabs
unfortunately i think we're gonna have
to put some extra sauce on it
i don't know though i think a bubble tea
place is like you know
i think it's a lock man sure some of
them go out of business but just like be
built different
you know
how hard could it be forehead
or like a korean barbecue restaurant
because you don't even have to pay any
chefs
the dummies will cook the food
themselves and then they'll they'll tip
you on top of that
what a country
genius so this is
just like is is basically unlosable huh
that's the that's the thing on this
challenge
you lost it well yeah but i'm as
mentioned i'm built different but this
time in like a bad way
come on man you know hey i don't got all
day here
we could lose we could go to the
self-sacrifice room
we also do have no bombs there's some
truth to that
we might end up just dodging a lot i did
this whole challenge without knowing
that i could touch enemies
that's so good
[Laughter]
but you know you get bragging rights
i mean i wouldn't have known if it
weren't for chad honestly i would have
been out here just spinning my wheels
being like you know it's impossible who
made this
we should save this we could get a deal
why not
but now we don't even need a deal
hold on i'm losing my mind
we could get any item that's exactly
what we wanted anarchist cookbook who's
out of bombs now buddy
who's out of bombs now not me
couldn't be me
look at that greatest item in the game
he's done it kidney stone
confirmed confirmed kidney stone
we can shoot a single tier
[Laughter]
yo it's a progressive rate of fire
it gives you a huge rate of fire and
then takes it down now
i think that's pretty cool
that's pretty cool man that's pretty
sick
josh you're gonna play any repentance i
gotta tell you
i don't know if it's up your alley it's
it's not a real time strategy game from
the mid-2000s
i doubt it nerds are saying it's really
hard apollo did alt-f for the game
which is you know it just makes me that
much stronger
when he tweeted that it was super hard i
was like good
yeah yeah let the let the hate flow
through you
i'm not in the hard games bro that's
crazy because like real time strategy
games are the hardest games ever made to
even be bad at
like i can't even
whenever i play those i i can't even
like get my
economy stable much less like then i get
invaded by a bunch of
like you know weird aliens and i'm just
like whatever
just go ahead and take it it's trash
anyway
i should stop using the bombs the bombs
are quite
useful quite helpful i just need an
orbital man we get an orbital can of
corn and i'll be all right
well challenge uh invalidated
you have defeated an enemy using a tier
go back to step one do not pass go
how dare you
sure why not let's let's get it all out
of the way
you got you got any items for me that
don't do anything i'm happy to have them
so i think i know what that i had this
candle earlier today
i think i know what it does um
it uh if you keep the candle alive
it gives you a progressive tear bonus
every room i think like it tears up
every room
to the best of my knowledge something
like that
i've been playing a bit of yakuza kiwami
i'm sure chad will be happy to hear that
our guy slash our guy
don't you think they're kind of milking
those yakuza games a little much though
like they were only
i remember i was at tokyo game show a
few years ago there were like
six of them right five of them maybe at
the time
now like a new one comes out on steam
like every half hour i don't understand
how they're able to do that
like how in the last year there's been
like
like six came out and then like a dragon
and kiwami and like
wasn't there a new one that just came
out like like yesterday or something
like how are they making so many man
like did they hire the guy who made five
nights at freddy's
their output is like out of control i'm
jealous is really what it's all about
that's what i'm trying to say
it's not a bit it's not the beats
put that cookie down ah put that karaoke
down
sorry it's a little-known actor by the
name of
arnold s
josh you'll give it to me straight how
how much time is it gonna take you to
beat the new yakuza game
because like i'm at the point in my life
where like
oh it's gonna take forever okay say no
more all right
okay everybody sorry you heard it i was
about to play it and then josh said it
would take too long so
looks like i'm taking it off the the
twitch schedule
well you know the old people's champion
how the mighty have fallen
thanks a lot josh i think it's just too
long
for for my current streaming mindset
it's too long for me
it's too big for you
is this the this is the final floor
right we're almost free
oh f you're gonna make me not play yeah
cause uh
wait a minute hold on it's scary in here
we're gonna be here for a hundred years
no that's not true i have bombs use them
just a long game man like why play an
80 hour long game when instead you could
use that time to do 400 different
quizzes on sporkle.com
what if i could get her to stomp on
samson's chain
and then free me and then i could pick
up samson's
chain and use it
as a a cannonball
to destroy her or
there you go one one shot at a time by a
kidney stone baby
one shot at a time just waiting for
kidneys oh i think we got it
no it just it just came off uh the bonus
let's go run into the little enemies of
course you fool you fool
okay kidney stone the kill shot with
kidney stone would be a dream
my god the man is a genius boss rush
yeah sure why not
just kidding all right
uh easy challenge
dirty mind has been unlocked next
challenge



easily beat uh whatever the first
challenge was
scat man now we're on bloody mary i
believe you also play as bethany again
good luck in the next challenge uh oh
i'm a little scared i'm a little scared
i remember this item i don't remember
what it does
the the sword but i remember the item
i'm not ignoring josh
i i saw what he said he said the side
missions are your jam
i believe it but they're like you know
they're so long man
also if the side missions were my jam
like
why would um why wouldn't they make the
whole game out of them
the same way they make the whole plane
out of the uh the
black box
what's the deal with side missions
i mean i'll give you the same deal that
we did with with death stranding
all play longer games but you have to
watch the whole damn thing
okay like if you watch like one episode
and then turn it
tune in here or there
it's gonna be a deal breaker you gotta
you gotta be there for every second
and tell like minimum 100 of your
friends
and then maybe i'll give it a one hour
tryout
i'm also always i'm a little wary and
this is not an anti
yakuza thing at all i'm a little wary of
those games that like
everybody wants you to play that they've
already played
because i'm like i i feel like i'm like
the band at a at a concert and they're
like playing my favorite song
i always see in chat people are like and
i was gonna love the
the bike mission has he done the bike
mission yet
has he done the bike mission oh my god
he's gonna load guys
did i miss the bike mission then when
the bike mission shows up
unless it's like you know the greatest
thing i've ever seen in my life i'm like
wasn't all that you just kind of rode a
cool looking bike man
i don't know though corey do you have a
your your
you lived in japan oh my god
did you like yakuza have you played it
it seems like it'll be your cup of tea
red hearts means you get more
uh hp hey tomorrow
but this rock is pretty sick too
it's fun but i didn't like it for stream
uh oh
oh no i'm just now realizing
doesn't this item take you down to half
a heart at the start of every floor
oh but you gulp your stats okay
that's mighty interesting
i don't have any wisps
oh gifties give these
no please
i forgot
let's go saved god gamer
okay so then you know every challenge
you can kind of distill
down to like what how do i break it
right how do you break this one it's
pretty simple
be so good that you never get hit or
alternatively get like a book of uh
revelations or something oh and there's
no item rooms right
yeah now i'm i'm piecing it together and
you can never get
uh spirit hearts because you're bethany
and you can't
uh
you have to go all the way to mega satan
oh my god
we could change character that's a good
point if we get like dark judas or
something
too bad i just squandered the deal with
the devil like a fool
i mean restock and then like infinite
money could do something for us
ah just normal satan okay
i mean if we could do this on the first
try that's that's a powerful motivator
when another isaac uh content creator
one of the top
60 daily players of all time flak blag
tells you that tells you good luck
if that doesn't light a fire under you
you're living in the north pole
i will take every pill
did he do the bike mission jesse what
the hell are you talking about
shot speed up
it's very aggressive um
i will head in here and then
get nothing but that's fine because we
couldn't have used it anyway tears down
bombs are key
yeah i got nothing else to say anyway if
we're gonna play yakuza it's not gonna
be for a long time
we're gonna have to win a single run of
this first which might uh take 30 hours
i'm not sure
should be a little uh variety tomorrow
though like uh
dan and i i think we're still going
ahead with the with hand and brain which
i'm excited for
you know we're not gonna just know life
isaac for forever
excuse me by the way i saw somebody say
uh
no band stream sag some of you were not
here for
the um marriage or mortgage conversation
ended shows
sad couldn't be me couldn't be me
it is not pronounced sad gu it's sag
and it's honestly sad good that you try
to bait me like that
disrespectful okay i did see someone in
chat
say that it's only a 30
chance for small rock to work now
which is very unfortunate
[Laughter]
this is no longer an item i think i want
to hang my hat on
okay i mean you got to use it
new shot speed just dropped
nl's credit card been real quiet since
this challenge started
he lived
oh uh almost died a bone heart
that might protect us from one hit
hate this just don't drop a troll bomb
like that's all i ask
actually a single bone heart if we don't
lose it
should be like a permanent
protection until we lose it i should say
as long as we can fill it up at some
point on every floor oh but that's gonna
that's gonna mean not getting hit for
like a long time
yeah that's tough i don't even know if
we ever got close to full on the last
floor
oh well you know what you do hold on
we're getting a little bit more
complicated but in a good way
um we
simply have to make it so that on a deal
with the devil we give up
all of our hp except for one heart
container and the bone heart
and then it's so much easier to fill and
we have a lot of protection and
presumably
presumably some good items
from the deals with the devil as well
how about that
how's that for some gaming
ah whatever
no spawns you know what
it's a little tough
now i'm like who did they have play test
this game because there's only like
eight people on the planet capable of
of hanging in here right now and i'm not
even sure that i'm one of them
don't shoot a green ball at me don't
shoot
red hearts let me guess red hearts no
okay never mind that would be too easy
you gotta stack those flames up yo but
none of my
bookable aisle plays have actually
created flames for me because we
i don't think we have book of wisps or
whatever book of virtues i think we just
have book of belial
how the heck are you supposed to do this
man
you already did it once oh well in that
case
okay
we need hp more than anything else i'm
like
sharp key doesn't do enough for us
because we don't get any freaking wisps
when we use it if we got wisps that
would be nice but we don't you know i
think we got it yeah i was hoping to get
like a single half red heart or
something but no such luck
red heart there's a chance
so you're saying there's a chance
i'm gonna take the card i agree i you
know what and that justice card we gotta
play this like a lost run right now
paint me like one of your lost runs by
the way i i saw your compliment josh
thank you i i
you know i'm i'm worse than i should be
at this game considering how much i
played it but i
i'll take the compliment as it stands
for luck now we're talking
and there's no item rooms anyway so uh
we don't have to backtrack because
there's no point
look at that okay now
we're just praying for easy boss bombino
as i saw dan fight this guy he's a melee
driven boss
yo 30 chance to pick up some money
that was not great goodbye deal with the
devil
i'm gonna die but i'm gonna live
until i die
it's not possible
thanks for the money dummy uh what if
you punch this bomb
yeah yeah right there idiot oh no
okay giving out some gifted subs cool
no big deal it's just the challenges is
like impossible
just click complete purchase click the
button complete purchase sad guy
a little sad guy there
like look you're oh you're gonna make me
cyber bully okay
the thing is like i get it it's supposed
to be a challenge they're not called
like runs that are easy to inflate your
self-esteem for no reason but at the
same time like
why no item rooms you know
it's already hard because you go down to
like zero hp at the start of every floor
that's that's
that's a tough challenge
and then on top of that it's it's also
got the
oh by the way screw you
so it's a little much but then that's
always how i feel about the challenges
and then when i beat them i go no never
nerf them
because then that wouldn't be fair to
the people who suffered earlier
was thinking hold on what if
it's a bit it's a bit ballsy
what if you got
a lot of stuff out of this
self-sacrifice room
this is boomer logic yeah it's the joke
the joke is that it has parallels to the
student loan forgiveness
debate i put it all in the required
reading
before the stream did you not get the
memo the sub only memo
i mean we released it on the patreon so
i i mean i feel like you would get it
unless you're not a tier three patron
you lost the syllabus i missed the part
where that's my problem
peter parker spiderman one words to live
by
we can't even get spirit hearts so what
do you do you could smelt a single
trinket for 15 cents
that's low value you could buy a card
and pray
that's my kind of strategy
get the hot pot it's not bad josh but
it's
it's not all that in the bag of potato
chips
good name by the way it does look like a
hot pot
and in many ways a smelter
you know it's kind of a
there's a pot that's hot
meet the pot that can't get hot super
cup
uh you can walk diagonally through these
i have found my ticket to narnia
you cannot destroy me i have the
ultimate dodging location
you can't hit me
that's pretty sick does this guy play
among us
um i have played among us i'm insanely
bad at it
i i'm like genuinely one of the worst
among us players you've ever seen
i'm good or let me rephrase i'm bad at
the tasks
i pay no attention whatsoever to what
anybody does and as a result i have no
way to accuse anybody of doing anything
i'm just living in my own head the whole
time
well it's something it's certainly
something
you feel blessed so now we got angel
room chances
dude that error room would have been
sick
an attempt was made
is there a red heart in the shop maybe
no i'm pretty i'm pretty terrible at
among us like
you know what could be worse
you got to take these chances i think
here
now trivia yeah now we're talking does
this guy play any trivia
so we got a very minor stat upgrade um
which is the only downside to having
spent
all of our uh our hp on the last floor
because we do lose it all when we come
down to this floor but man like this is
this is tough
holy mantle could
could really make my day
[Laughter]
like holy mantle sac dagger now we're
talking
yeah the stream we only got about 20
minutes left in the stream i appreciate
all the support today we'll be back
tomorrow to play
uh a bunch of repentance and also some
other stuff but
if you like what you see especially like
here's my cell okay
if you're a youtube viewer you're used
to you know maybe like five years ago
when
a new isaac expansion would come out i'd
release like four videos a day
the time to do that does not exist
anymore
is is gone and you know it might not
come back for like
i don't know until isaac 2 comes out
right we're streaming a lot on twitch
we're going to be playing a ton you
should follow on twitch and you get
unfiltered access to live isaac
including the runs that are so bad they
won't make it to youtube
isn't that a nice selling point you
could get a lower average quality of
content
but the trade-off is if you make a funny
joke in
chat i might steal it and pretend it's
mine so
you know you take the good with the bad
so i i would appreciate uh
clicking that follow button if you think
you'd like to see the content in the
future
you could be here for the the live pot
play
a live rendition of the pot plate
live from the hollywood bowl i don't
even know what the pod play is
all i know is i'm sick of hearing about
it shouldn't even brought up someone
will be like oh i got the
an oral history of the pod play
man you know would be sick any
consumables or any items
sorry did i say that out loud that was
meant for the private discord
for tier three subs only
okay i mean they call it a challenge for
a reason
i suppose
nice little jingle gotta try them
range up tears down that's pretty
terrible telepills is okay
paralysis is bad but at least it doesn't
impact us permanently
i just want to go into the shop man i
just want to go into the shop
how come you don't shop me man
okay great shooting you seeing this
accuracy like you know we're screwed up
when
like my accuracy is higher in isaac than
it is in pub g
bomb for a bomb the bang the bang second
secret room and up jump the boogie
yo saved okay
now this would be a wonderful time to
get a deal with the devil
it's it's merely larry jr
and a quick little tinted rock
with the red heart in it the spirit art
is irrelevant can you
you can stack book of belial huh well
like there's never been a better time
because we need a deal with the devil to
transform our lives
that's a damage upgrade which is very
nice
you might as well it's a great item it's
not something that's really gonna
you know win the challenge for us but
it's a nice item no doubt about that
and we still don't have a key and we're
not gonna get one but there's no reason
not to go to the curse room because
we're losing the hp to begin with
and then we'll tell the pills and see
what happens man it's it's got a better
chance than
than our previous run at least
donkey donkey donkey donkey that donkey
donkey donkey pitch perfect pitch
perfect rendition
well it at least it took me closer all
right now let's start it all over again
excuse me uh my flies please oh they
closed the door on me
i should have gone up fast oh
no no small room
every time i see a room i recognize it's
like
it's a dream come true when i see a room
i don't uh
recognize i get very very anxious
saved still no keys
what does the item do it takes all of
your red hearts except for half of one
every single floor and it gives you a
proportionate increase in
tears and damage based on how many red
hearts it took
i'm happy to stay here as long as
they'll have me quite frankly
so because of the fact that you know
bethany as a character
can't get spirit hearts essentially
you're always
gonna start every new floor one hit away
from death which is
is anxiety inducing without a doubt
is exactly what i was hoping for and now
i have no problem coming in here
it's a boss i've seen before my god
now what are you rooting for it's little
victories
all up and down that's how you get to
the the win here
you get a deal with the devil with your
36.9
chance repeating of course and then it
has a dream item in it
nice little damage upgrade no it can't
be taken
i know what you're gonna say i already
know what you're gonna say you take
you just diagonally walk take death's
touch and then go to victory
you don't take it you you're gonna want
to have
in my opinion at least you're gonna want
to have the empty heart containers to
fill up
i think it's the right way to play plus
like death's touch
controversial opinion maybe not that
good of an item
overrated insubordinate and shirlish
it's good but i don't think it's that
good
where's the keys uh johnny depp from uh
pirates of the caribbean
where's the keys gone they don't exist
two full floors no keys two floors
two uh full floors no keys how about
that
maybe there's some keys in here have you
taken my keys
no all right down to the next floor then
it's all right i didn't want to go to
the shop anyway six panties pog
the average penny enjoyer versus the
average
uh key worshiper
yoho song in pirates 3 rolls hard prove
me wrong
spelled r-o-n-g um
i've i've only seen the first pirates
film
i uh i bet it goes hard
wouldn't surprise me i mean you know
there's a reason people like them right
and it wasn't because johnny depp was
playing chris angel
he finally got a key pog now we just
need to live
just survive to the to the shop i still
don't even really know
on the shop what would i be looking for
i think consumables are kind of higher
value
because they allow us to i mean like a a
card that could be a joker or
you know i don't even like even a
lover's card or a justice card that we
could save until we got close to death
i'm starting to see like the light at
the end of the tunnel here
but it's still a long way to go yo the
sacrifice
thank you thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
appreciate it
safety blanket would be pretty good
happy repentance day oh thank and happy
repentance
and a happy repentance day to you as
well
what's happening oh the flies are doing
my dirty work for me like steely dan
i'm so stupid i was glancing
[Laughter]
don't let it demoralize you stay in
there
i was thinking about steely dan
i thought i was so safe let's go okay
saved saved
super saved now i can glance all i want
they'll make the whole universe my slave
play canasta with your grandma
then push her down the stairs just
thinking just thinking mor
more keys is is a positive there's no
doubt about that
could always play the blood bank with
remaining hp
restock i think is we gotta consider
restock
it gives us consumable swim
it used to give us consumables when you
bought it
which was fun
oh my god this shot speed
and we are getting a decent amount of
money can't deny that
i do want to go to the curse room but we
can't go to the curse room
until after we fight the boss because
this boss could
easily put me in the ground
what the heck yo the reflective tears
are like the
not tears but the reflective floor looks
so nice
second bomb
restock iv bag i don't know what that
means
we there is a blood bag for sure
i think we got to play this judgment
dude
cost us almost all of our bombs we're
using
probably more money than we should but
we kind of need the uh we need the high
value payouts here i don't know bumbo
bumbo is not it's not that bad it's not
that good but it's not that bad either
it's something at least i kind of want
the money for now
uh because we got restock but how was
restock nerfed by the way
was it just nerfed by like there's no
consumables anymore or did they do
something
um more insidious
price of items goes up okay
not not a concern that's germaine to
this run
now that is good luck okay so we'll take
it
we'll take it
these i want a little slice of all of
them
i'm gonna be honest i want a little
slice of all these we can't take them
both
so here's the thing okay sack dagger
best item um out of the three
but we can't afford to get that close to
enemies but it does have defense
associated with it
money equals power modest damage
increase
when we don't really need it
it's tough man hey troy thanks for the
gift of subs
thank you much appreciated
back at it again ba at it again with the
repentance
i agree with with the chat discourse i
think you take sack dagger
which apparently it looks smaller to me
but that's okay
it spins faster maybe i know we've got
the uh
eternal hard but we're
i mean i don't i just don't feel
confident in that
i'm mostly just happy to be alive
i am definitely at the point where like
a single
lovers card would would really hit the
spot
i'm concerned
because if i take it
i don't know let's take it it'll be
funny
oh it only gives us one heart okay i i
thought it was the item that gives us
uh it replaces all of our uh
all of our heart containers with with
empty bone hearts but
clearly that's not the case clearly
that's not the case
no he's so stupid he just gave away an
hp
upgrade for what killing me won't bring
back your gosh darn honey
compound fracture
look i get it corey you know the names
of the items okay congrats
good good for you okay everybody
everybody corey knows the names of
all the items corey oh mr big man daily
challenge champion
uh second place all time next to pells
he knows the names of all the items wow
wow
everybody just bow down you can tell the
difference between brittle bones and
compound fracture
geez louise yeah easy clap easy clap for
corey please
just because some of us can't tell the
difference between the 19 different
kinds of attack flies in the game i
guess you gotta you feel the need to
flex on me or something
isn't it enough for you coming second
place on the
leaderboards every day to pels
really makes you think man really makes
you think okay i don't even know
so here's like we're okay i got a plan i
got a plan
sorry corey sorry um we're gonna play
the blood bank
you're gonna be like of course because
you need the blood bag no i don't have
the the hp container would be nice but
we don't really care too much
um and the speed is irrelevant but for
bumbo to get like a little bit of money
would be pretty sick if i could even get
him like one level up
i would i would treat that as a the
small blessing that it is
um
and i'll tell you i mean maybe i'll buy
the pill
and then try to take it on the next
floor i think that's
i think that's my game plan right now
but hold on we're not done yet we're not
done yet
six cent item whoa
no i'm not worried about mom's key she's
she's got my number
on an average run shirt like we would
buy it no question on this run i don't
know i don't see the
the the use case
come on bumbo one one extra level up
please
one extra level up just one more
let's go
okay now we're free
we got it we got a level three bumbo not
quite max level but we're
trying to get every single advantage
conceivable this will be our last run
without a doubt though
okay debs one he's a genius
he's actually the smartest gamer
if we had mom's key we would be deceased
right now
and nobody would realize that it was
their fault
really makes you think man
you got 4 000 hours in this game who
who would you rather trust somebody with
4 000 hours or 4 000 people with one
hour
it's called the ship of theseus look it
up sometime it's on disney plus
if you it reminds me of a very famous
quote
if you want something done badly give it
to a group of people
if you want something done right give it
to a streamer
fool me once shame on you
fool me twice
we won't get fooled again
he's doing it man okay we gotta figure
out what we're gonna do on the next
floor though hold on hold on
okay whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i might
freaking deal with the devil no it's
still up there because we didn't lose
the bone heart yet okay great news
tinted rock no bad news okay don't
resort to using your sac dagger
you don't need to do it you don't need
to perform surgery
beautiful okay a second orbital incoming
yo this guy looks like nick bruiser from
punch out now they really did a good job
with the veins on his forehead
do it coward no you do it coward
okay we take and i'm just gonna very
quickly send a message to my wife on
discord i'm gonna say
hello i'm just finishing
this run shouldn't be more than
15 mins maximum well
i am putting a rush
on it there we go there we go
greetings good day to your partner i'm
greetings
you can already tell i'll be your only
friend in this
god forsaken camp
hold on i've received the reply okay
sounds good
poggy let's go
can you give your best punch out
announcer message
or impression nick
brozer
yeah it's a great game super punch-out
it's a great game man
gabby j yay
great game is nl on crack today
that'd be a pretty messed up character
uh turn right like if i just
turn to like hard street drugs
well it's legal now right
oh no you're i was thinking of uh grass
i had them confused because they're both
on the same level of danger
what do we got i don't know what i'm
talking about man okay the card is an is
a must buy
items my friendship with items now dead
friendship with items dead now
consumables are my best friend sorry
bumbo i should have let you have that
man i apologize that's on me
that's still somewhat useful
that actually is probably better um we
can use that to
have a better chance to get a red heart
for sure
it's okay frowny face oh no bumbo come
on
average consumable enjoyer
don't you have friends who enjoy grass
i wouldn't say i have friends who enjoy
it i would say
i have friends who the grass
enjoys them because it swallowed their
spirit and soul and
all their ambition and motivation and
hygiene habits and stuff but
you know would do does the friend enjoy
it i don't know
not as much as the grass enjoys the
beautiful spirit that it is enraptured
you know what i mean
hate the sin love the sinner
what are you talking about jesse
let's give it a try
for legal purposes this is a bit
dude imagine if that's what the law was
actually like like if you said
you could say whatever you want as long
as you add i'm joking to the end
that'd be something
oh i got so scared man
get out of jail free card
yes your honor i i dropped a sarcasm tag
at the end of my threat
real talk if i pick this up
will i be able to use get out of jail
free to leave this room
no all right see you later loser
you're a loser nobody likes you your
item sucks
help me
all right well like it's impossible man
it's an impossible game
it's impossible challenge



it can be done
the comedic timing all pills are good
now
confirmed confirmed
he do be spinning
i've i'm i'm and we've been doing this a
lot i'm making like a new
sweeping rule okay
like one rule that i had is if i get mad
at chad for more than two minutes
consecutively
and i show it um because i'm just
constantly a little upset sure you know
why not it's meme city let's do it
um
this should be fun did they remove
knockback on soy milk by the way
because if so that's sick that's a it's
an amazing item now
oh let's go i did see dan talking about
it and then like
i was like he was so positive about soy
milk i was like it must
either be changed or this guy has no
idea what he's talking about i suppose
both could be true
but anyway um i so the the rule of not
getting mad at chad has worked very well
the vibes have been way better
occasionally someone comes in and tries
to start an argument and you just either
like ignore them or
time them out and it's pretty sick uh
it's been much better
my new rule that i'm gonna start to
practice a little bit
is uh never answer
whether or not you're gonna play a game
unless the answer to the question is yes
because about nine this is really nice
about ninety percent of the time
that someone asks are you going to play
x game the answer is no
uh and if i say that it's taken
not just by the original person but by
everybody in chat
as like an opportunity and an invitation
to argue about like why actually you
should play it
or to make a joke that's like ohs but
you'll play this game
20 billion times but you won't play
this game one time a little hypocritical
much
right so i think that i i'm i'm slowly
teasing a part in diagnosing the vibe
destroyers and and that's a big one that
i
play my own role in for sure
i see people in chat with no irony that
are like if you don't answer the
question
you're gonna get the question more often
that's true
but if i answer the question i'm also
gonna continue to get the question
[Laughter]
just due to the nature of the of the
twitch ecosystem
people were like oh sorry i know i typed
it 1500 times in chat even though you
answered it you answered it before i got
here so
yo brandon all right sorry not brandon
not brandon thanks for the
the gifted subscriptions thank you
i'm watching this run then i'm going to
bed so you better make it a good one
you picked a good game because
repentance like the average run
went from like probably 30 minutes and
after birth plus to like 70 minutes in
in repentance so so prepare yourself
because you you might be up for a while
that could be a good thing though like i
don't know it depends if you got
something to do in the morning
yeah unless i die on floor two that's
fair that's a fair question
honestly i i got a new i got a new think
i got a new thing going on here
what if we don't go to the alt path on
floor one and then we go to the alt path
on floor two instead uh what the heck is
oh it's a dice room
how about that
which i think might guarantee with that
we get the
we get the mirror or maybe it gives us a
50 chance to get the mirror i don't know
changing chat meta too much i miss
armchair psychology
that's all right just wait till the next
time we play warzone like honestly the
number one
chat moderation tool in my toolbox is
activity
if you can have a lot of chat activity
people breaking the rules aren't as
annoying you know how it sounds
but you know
if if something gets swept away really
quickly then it's not that big of a deal
so if you wanna
if you wanna have uh that's such a good
item by the way
i'm gonna take it man i know it's a
little weird but
if you if you want to get some armchair
psychology in i know you're being
sarcastic but if you want to get some
armchair psychology in
you should uh you should just wait till
like maybe wars on monday
then you'll have an opportunity
it's all about the ratio yes sir
can't forget the ratio
it's worth the look at least
why not take guppy's tail i'm not a
believer in in guppy's tale
uh statically and i'm not that confident
in my ability to have the hp base to
take
uh all the deals with the devil that
show up so i've been a little bit
coy with the guppy plays lately i also
apparently guppy is uh
it only has a 50 or a 30 chance to spawn
flies on tears now like per shot
still really good don't get me wrong but
50 yeah so it's you know
it's relatively weaker than it was
recently but still
good okay
you know i'll probably take it when we
go back to the deal with the devil now
[Laughter]
guppy's tail in the paper clip though
you're gonna you're gonna make me tap
the sign
the sign is you know we may have
philosophical disagreements but
you know very minor backseating for the
guy who has 4 000 hours in the game
is underappreciated not not as
appreciated as you might think it is
you know we're both coming at this from
a learned perspective i'm sure
i'm sure you've you've probably got a
thousand hours
and that's cute i'm happy for you
we're gonna live yeah easily
best person whose name is also food
jesse what the hell are you talking
about
i don't mike trout kevin bacon
meatloaf iced tea
what about flava flav john hamm
dude that's a tough one i'll give you
the easy answer not
meatloaf steven fry that's a good one
that's funny eminem
i was walking uh the baby yesterday
come on man come on and uh
there there were two people like just
hanging out
uh listening to eminem
like super loudly on their phone
and like ramping the lyrics at each
other
and you're gonna laugh is is like such a
canadian part of the bit
um but like it was it was very funny to
begin with to look at
and then secondarily when the song
finished
uh the lady went [ __ ] rights bud
and i was like
oh there's a tinted rock up there it i
was like it's the first time i've ever
heard somebody say that
in public unironically like i thought
that was a thing you only said
like when you're making fun of canadians
but no they're
i guess it's there for a reason
explosion immunity don't mind if i do
they would i can't deny they were having
a good time 4.5
volt beat the juice out of them no idea
what it means but
yo tell me you're canadian without
telling me you're canadian
we hear that all the time up north
that's crazy i mean i i did not grow up
uh
up north but i would have assumed that i
would have heard it in
my kind of like uh you know pseudo
hillbilly uh village where i grew up but
i think it's also a relatively recent uh
like within the past 15 years or so
it's had a resurgence let's say
the first time i ever heard it was in
fubar which is like
that's a while when i was a kid they
didn't
say it as much at least
yeah soy milk actually seems pretty
great now max
fire rate no knockback like i
i don't know what the downside is
4.5 seems like bad synergy for soy milk
though
i'm going to be honest i don't even know
what 4.5 volt does yet i'm assuming that
like
i have no idea you get a charge when you
hit enemies with some
extent oh it's slowly charges the active
yeah oh it gives you partial charges on
the batteries yo they turn the int into
a float dude
what's up with that
okay i gotta think about this this is
downpour two of course
as usual we can't see the uh
the map at all hello little ghost so we
have to
just figure out
where the the mirror and the fire are
it's hacker talk turn the int into a
float
hold on i'm almost in i just have to
cast the password to an int and then
type in 32.max value to institute a
buffer overflow
i'm in i'm going to steal all their nba
top shots
i'm gonna check this i'm not afraid
it's a unix system i know this
have you seen that clip of stanley
kubrick talking about um
unix
it's like he's being filmed on like a
camera
which i know is like oh of course what
else would he be filmed on a freaking
potato but like it's noteworthy because
it's in the 70s and it's like a handheld
camera or something like that so
you don't have to spin it up like you're
starting a lawnmower or something like
that
and then i think he reads like some
advertising copy he's like
it's a super powerful new operating
system it's called unix
it's a weird video man nl and comment
bagel are the only streamers i know who
aren't seething over repentance
[Laughter]
that's that's funny i know people are
like you know
it's it's hard like it's it's definitely
hard
i'm not oh what what i would say
is like i uh
i reserve judgment to some extent
because i all i'm i'm like at least
cognizant of the bias
that if you ever nerf anything like 90
of people who are used to it are gonna
hate it
if you buff something people are like
way less critical if you nerf something
they go
freaking off they're like i how dare you
hate fun
so i'm just you know i'm just chilling i
recognize you know like your first
impression
it takes a little longer to form what
you really think about it
i'm uh the game was very easy
before the runs where it was hard
in my opinion oftentimes they were hard
for the wrong reason
in this i feel like the runs that i lose
some of them admittedly
i have been like i had no chance
whatsoever
but a lot of them have just been like
man that boss was like
that was a tough boss what are you gonna
do
and again i i stand by what i said a
little earlier as well which is like
a lot of my losses also just come from
gamer inertia where i'm like i refuse to
do
this super easy way right at the start
even like i'm like i'm never gonna play
normal mode are you crazy and then when
i die i'm like it's too hard
like speaking of a perfect example right
here
what are you supposed to do man i got
soy milk there's nothing you can do
let's go oh i'm the loss though that
doesn't help me
now i'll tell you this would have been a
fantastic room to save uh
uh to save necronomicon for we could use
a damage upgrade let's
let's be realistic yo what if we
perthrowed that man
oh now we're talking
we got enough bombs we should be able to
bomb our way through the boss quite
easily
i don't think people are let me play
this i think people are are positive
about repentance um
especially new items i do think the
difficulty let me put it this way i
wouldn't be surprised if it gets tuned
down a little bit in the future
but i also think that streamers are like
you know when they're used to winning
anything that makes the run more
difficult is gonna
it's gonna be walked into the spikes huh
it's gonna encounter a little layer of
um
the barrier to entry for liking it is
gonna be higher because
you know there's almost like some ego
and some expectation on the line i guess
is what i'm trying to say
it's not to say that there's uh let's go
that's not to say there's not an
argument that maybe like there's things
to be changed
like definitely i do wonder to some
extent like hey you know i played three
thousand hours of this and
you know so viktor's played 3 000 hours
of this and if we're both struggling to
win runs where we have like the
you know two or three
previously game-winning items like maybe
there's a case to be made that it's a
little difficult for the person that
only has like 500 hours or something but
for now i think the difficulty is is
good and also like very
refreshing i would say can you get it i
don't know if you can get a deal with
the devil in the mirror realm so just
work with me on this one
or a new player well yeah but i'm for if
you're a new player like i don't know
like where were you like seven years ago
when the game came out
like i would rather they tailor the game
to the to the experience
players uh experience right now because
like we're the ones still playing
they they could have been in the womb
back then okay fair enough that's true i
was eight years old
bro that's crazy really
can you imagine being born in 2005
like the year that peter jackson's king
kong came out
it's not gatekeeping at all like why are
you why are you trying to bait like an
argument for no reason just saying you
know you got tens of thousands of people
that
played a ton of the game like when it
came out and have kept it going for like
seven years
i'd rather the difficulty for like the
super hard stuff be tailored in the
direction of
of the existing player base you know
this is late game content exactly
if you want a game where you can just
like feel good all the time and press a
button and win and get free dopamine
play among us
it's that simple
doesn't even make any sense but i'm
going to continue the feud with among us
because i can
okay we're going down
i think i'm gonna joke her right away
too
i'm glad we did because the x i don't
know how it's affected but i feel like
we're
we're better off having done it because
the xl floor might have screwed us
so incubus is incredible the problem
here though
is if we take another item and then take
incubus they're going to dynamically
adjust the price
of incubus so i think what we want to do
is just take incubus
mission accomplished
none of the other items in my opinion
were even worth
the life that they might have cost us if
we hadn't
bad stepped diagonally onto the spikes
in the first place you drinking coke
excuse me this is a pepsi product it's
called sparkling
strawberry bubbly
has nothing to do with the coca-cola
corporation who i'll remind you have
been
canceled this week this is a pepsi
corporation product it's completely
different
completely inverted sense of corporate
values
this is interesting got a lot of
consumables that does not happen very
often
on uh on repentance hard runs
can i definitely try and shoot the whoop
okay let let me think about this for a
minute we gotta good luck stead okay
we're gonna start
with this two of diamonds we're just
gonna pop that immediately
i can see forever also sick okay how do
we play this
we want hp basically
f you hate to see it
just give it a sec okay we got another
opportunity
maybe dude this is actually pretty sick
why did this man take soy milk uh it's
actually good now
it's a good item now
take me back again i don't know do you
think cherry doesn't last as long now
will you apologize to dan i'm gonna need
you to be more specific
what what do you need me to apologize to
daniel for for
just in general no we got a good rapport
if
if he wants me to apologize he would
bring it up for sure
he doesn't mind being forward about that
kind of stuff
okay lover's card into the blood bank
there's a chance
for saying he didn't know what he was
saying when he said soy milk was good
look you could forgive me for
[Laughter]
you could forgive me for thinking it
right yo this is good
keep it moving man like i
we normally we probably wouldn't keep
doing this because we would be like oh
we're stoked anyway
but now i'm like we gotta keep sending
it
no bomber boy
because uh you know we need all the help
we can get quite frankly
that that hurts but you know what if you
give me like crystal ball or something
i forgot what i was talking about a
second ago
store credit yes yes
maybe the crawl space stuff no like
again the thing is
and we we talk about this from time to
time you gotta choose like the amount of
um back seating that you take
a lot of like for isaac i'm very
comfortable with how i play
the back seating is insanely helpful
for things like you know hey you forgot
like a key on the ground or something
like that
but when i see something that's like
three lines long that's like actually
like you should be doing this instead of
this i'm like
don't worry about it man like i got it
don't don't sweat it the crawl space
stuff i saw
people were like you forgot a crawl
space in the mirror dimension
then i remembered like the last time i
had a a crawl space that provided me
with any
value whatsoever was before that uh that
guy
was born the one that was born the same
year peter jackson's uh
king kong remake came out and i realized
you know what maybe
at this point we're just gonna try to
keep some momentum instead of in making
sure that we've got
100 optimum uh plays at all times
interesting so midas touch is like
this mighty interesting but we don't
have invincibility
except from some bombs so i think we
kind of go i think we go right today
for sure i think we go right today
that's pretty good honestly
that's pretty good all right let's go to
the shop and then
i think we got a good run incoming
i can't see anything
because we're in the mine shaft i wonder
if that would hurt me or
or if i could ride it then i was
thinking like if i ride it to what
purpose
and there it really is zero so let's not
even worry about it
this seems like a very stable run i
don't know if it has
like the sustain that you know at my
current familiarity i would consider
uh necessary in order to get to the
final boss if it's even the final boss
but
i definitely think we have a chance i
definitely think there's a shot
i've really one of the things that's
helped me out a lot because i have put
up
some some minor dubs is like uh
is very helpful
we gotta fish for guppy for sure it's
very helpful
to play the game super conservatively
don't take you know middling deals with
the devil
don't leave the floor until you've like
exhausted
almost every possible way that you could
pick up
more resources particularly hp
i mean like we're playing as kane and
it's still like we're kind of on the
borderline right here
can't ride it confirmed
secret room secret room
no secret room you got a fish you got
you you
you want a cat you got to get some fish
okay take me out of here
you're right i have x-ray vision and
that's see
that's a good example of the back
seating
otherwise i might have fished for that
for another you know two or three
minutes
helps the one of the best ways to use
the back seating for a game you're
familiar with is the counteract streamer
brain
where you're trying to think about how
to like uh you know
pivot off of all this into a discussion
about whatever happened to the career of
breckenmeier
oh we skipped i see what happened here
okay hold on
give me that
these suck we remember that okay we
still gotta fight
the boss here and we gotta go to the
mine cart room
we have bomb immunity this guy cannot do
any damage to
us we're immune to your charms like the
wax
lips of of robin when he goes up against
poison ivy and joel schumacher's 1997
film batman and robin
don't even need to look at the screen
man
this is some serious damage okay
the lucky penny sound almost makes up
for it not being that good
i want this i want that
and i wa no wait hold on was there
another there is another emperor card
algiz is really good i wonder
hold on let's see if i'm a genius here
this would be a genius level play
okay does not work but you know what we
tested something
in my opinion should work but that's
fine uh we don't want fishtail no we
want the emperor card
my personal opinion that should work now
i understand why all the streamers are
mad
oh wait wait we gotta get the minecart
room
i don't know i think we've only had two
buttons so oh but you know what the
third button is always in the minecart
room
there's always money in the banana stand
i walked into the fire i apologize
no but i can understand like you know oh
it's a great idea hanged man for the
knife piece room
beautiful idea
i can understand why people are are i
don't want to say perturbed but like
here's the thing the public perception
was that like that's tempting too though
the public perception was that the uh
you know the game when
it was hard it was hard for like the
wrong reasons
you know not having too many items in
the game that like do nothing
they say two items i mean too many items
um
yeah plus they've never played mafia the
lost city of heaven
so to have like nerfs on good items
oh we lost our card okay to have
nerfs on good items that people thought
there was no problem with
uh i can understand why that would
frustrate some people but i also
simultaneously
understand that like maybe the reason
people had uh
no problems with good items is because
good items
you know when they make the run easy you
feel good
you go i'm so good i won
whereas when an item kind of sucks
you're like i'm great
it's this item's fault that i that i
screwed up
oh i have walked into the fire for a
second time
just a good example of what not to do
go ahead go ahead there you go
this part i i stand by the idea that i'm
probably the best streamer on planet
earth at this particular section
i have not watched any other streamer do
this particular section yet
but i feel confident nonetheless
go just go
[Laughter]
yo
never let ignorance get in the way of a
good opinion
saved i
there's a bomb back here maybe or
another button or something
i'm trapped oh you got to take the long
way home like super [ __ ]
nope help
that that one i take a small amount of
issue with i felt like i was a little
bit
uh hemmed in there but that's okay saved
oh my god i got so much speed man
all right get me out of here hanged man
on the sacks
emperor card on the next floor
little under hp
nine lives makes it not so bad but we're
a little under hp'd here
if we could maybe pick up some uh like
an item that generated spirit
hearts uh for example
you know what let's uh
let's try to maximize our payouts here
you never know you could have gotten a
uh
magic mush mini mush any variety of mush
really
all right joanna won
i don't want to emperor out of here i i
want to get
okay those enemies shoot melee beams i
did not know that
okay okay uh i what are you
you you deflect extremely good to know
that sucked
this room sucks big time
fair enough honestly i was inundated
with new stimulus there
that was that was tricky
i will also say and this is you know not
to take the other streamers sides but
there are times when i'm playing this
game where i
get hit on a room and i just go you know
what
realistically i i can't be mad at myself
just there's so much stuff on the screen
like i don't think i could have possibly
realistically uh parsed what i needed to
do when i got hit there
oh my god it's so loud i that literally
just walked on the spikes
that one's that one's completely my bed
don't
but it's definitely tough like
particularly the alt paths
they have made the game confirmed not
easy
this would be a great time to get blood
bag oh i've been april fools by the way
people told me nl you can go down to
zero spirit hearts
or zero red hearts i should say
i have been pranked
that's a pretty good one though you got
me on that one oh you have to have
spirit hearts to do
it okay then that makes sense
bro come on now hey you oh
this guy hasn't watched 75 hours of
other streamers playing the game because
he's been too busy uh playing it himself
and raising his kid
come on man come on dog that's the
nastiest thing
yo is that not two steam sales
second steam sale i heard was nerfed and
it's uh
it only makes things 25 cheaper on the
second one
that's still pretty good
we do have 74 cents so maybe not like
hyper relevant right now
but it's still pretty good
but that third steam sale when you get
the 87
off oh baby
interesting temperance
you know let's see what this is
something's wrong
it's an interesting room to donate a
bunch of stuff
beautiful what's the the croissant the
croissant is mom's bracelet it lets you
throw
rocks
and bombs whatever you get um
you see what i mean about chat activity
being the ultimate cure-all
you know what hold on
i've got an idea you grab mom's bracelet
we use it to break every single cool
rock
and hopefully get something good
all right uh and hopefully get something
good
this is i mean i've i've lost a lot of
uh
lives and hp on this run to some simple
uh
mistakes
i think it's up to me to to commit to
this one
can you throw the pillars you know we
can test throwing the pillars for sure
you cannot throw the pillars
this one's going to require something
though we're not quite there
in the run like in terms of the quality
of it it's actually pretty good it's
just in terms of the the enemies are
even higher quality
if it were not for that we would be uh
we'd be okay we we probably need
sure why not um we probably need uh
i don't know like eight heart containers
would start to make me feel a little bit
more confident
charm of the vampires doing something i
i can't disrespect it
nah no thank you
oh i hate it
bombs are legit oh bombs are legit
though
okay we shouldn't have taken the spirit
hard yet um
the problem is like i could definitely
get into this room but i don't want to
fight
the boss right now but we only have
three rooms anyway so like
i guess we might as well i'm gonna pick
it up
and then we'll emperor out because i
mean you gotta like
the damage output is is crazy man like
when we actually get the enemy in our
sights
we're doing some serious work but you
know
i don't think i need to tell you we also
have a certain element of fragility
don't kill me not not like this
just get it in there okay we lived
and we got the matchbook incredible item
it's saved
well uh i would say for now
it this seems like a run where we are
just not possible it seems like a run
where we're fairly likely to have
performed well but die anyway we'll see
yeah unfortunately this is not mom's
knife it's it's a
it's a reasonable analog
they won't let me pick them up but i'll
tell you you know
23 bomber boy bombs
let's take a chance on this i wish i
knew how that abba song went there's all
this song
and it's when it when a new game's out
and it's dlc go to angel
rooms take a chance on me if you roll
your eye
you know what i mean
no all right that's fine too uh like i
don't know man shoot the whoops not that
good but neither is the bracelet
bracelet i think provided us with no
value
[Laughter]
like i'm just stunned we i don't think
we got anything out of the bracelet the
whole time
we did save some bombs but like
i uh it's true it's true there's
something to that
what was this again it was bad right
dad's key dude i'm gonna level with you
i don't know
eddie oh thank you for the raid daniel
thank you
love the equal smile we love the equal
smile here
um we're we're on a bit of a spicy one
we're on joanna too joanna oldson
i took dad's key just to get like funky
with him man like i don't know
shoot the whoop is fine but it's not
really doing a ton of damage because we
got
dan's favorite milk here
updated to your list when so and
previously i've said never
hey key items key synergy
locks have been real quiet since new
keys dropped
um previously my answer has been
never uh and like i'm done but i don't
know i even like entertained the thought
today of of going through the patch list
like something's happened to my brain
it's like wouldn't it be funny if i just
spent like three hours going through the
isaac patch list
uh giving my opinion on uh the changes
then i decided not to because i thought
it would be like
i'd rather just play the game
[Laughter]
but the the the isaac juices are
definitely flowing again
this is the kind of stuff you think
about now because an alt path run takes
three hours
let me in
purge does it with dota yeah but that's
because you know
i imagine if you're like a dota player
any opportunity you get to capture that
audience without having to subject
yourself to the game is like a huge win
i actually enjoyed uh isaac so
sorry purge it's it's meant to be
humorous i hope i hope it's taken that
way
i think they had a dota player would be
like yes i know nobody hates the game
more than us
you've got us nuns have it all right
sister act has been real quiet since new
nuns habit just dropped
not not my favorite bit of damage there
for sure but
you know it's the we call that the
glance tax
i mean we do not care at all about camo
undies
so we're taking the right item
i think i speak for the gallery when i
say
pog heavy pog
energy radiating out of the the core of
that item room oh it's good
okay i can't see the screen
so dodging is a little tricky but this
is pretty amazing
doesn't melt mom as fast as i thought it
as fast as i thought it would but
still really nice oh i didn't i only
thought you could do that if you had a
willing partner on the other side but
apparently not
that was mighty nice uh we take polaroid
i have no i what the heck is this uh
home
theoretical phd false phd
worst pills plus evil up
[Laughter]
so like all bad pills but we got some we
got spirit hearts
or demon hearts or demon heart at least
i mean this is pretty good
as long as you aren't concerned with the
bit rate
like it looks pretty good on my end
i don't know where to go
looks pretty bad on the stream i can
imagine that
i imagine you're probably uh you're
probably suffering a little bit over
there what the heck
all right here we go new is this the
final boss already now that i think
about it
looks great on 160p
dude boss is a little tough
enemies though insanely easy
yo soy milk uh tec
x unbelievable combo incredible
can i also tell you by the way i had a
run today you will not
expect you know what the hero of the run
was
uh isaac's jar of tears
for the first time in my entire life i i
had a run
the the the two most impo important
elements of the run
and i'm not being facetious at all were
marked and isaac's jar of tears i was
like
you know what ed you got me
my tier list has been real quiet since
item adjustments got dropped
keep it moving
i don't know how you got destroyed i i
don't think those enemies are supposed
to be destroyed by damage but i'll take
it either way
i'll watch that 100
click bait undefeated
false phd makes it so bad pills give you
a damage up
that's incredible that's amazing
i'm just i'm trying to set the stage by
the way
this run could still go
totally wrong like i still would bet
probably on losing to the boss
it's really good but like i'm
not that good at not getting hit
[Laughter]
if we had some more some more hp i would
feel more comfortable
i would be like i i would feel like we
got a pretty good shot
i mean i guess i can't say i feel like
we don't have a shot but
i feel like we uh we don't have a
guarantee yet
i don't think we're too far off but i
don't know
where's april fools on the holiday tier
list we we covered it a little earlier
in the stream today it's
certainly one of my least favorite
holidays for sure
and i mean you don't even get the day
off so it's like it's truly bad
bombs are somewhat precious but i gotta
give you a try here
okay that's helpful although i think we
might be taking a full heart of damage
from this guy so
well hold on if bad pills give you
damage let's put ourselves
on the path and then use it to see if we
get damaged
i just want to get on the path first
blow him up good one
it's only stat pills that do it okay
thank you thank you
appreciate it
come on man come on
there we go wow it's mama mega dude
oh no i've uh obliterated you
dude the new effect is actually awesome
that's so cool
it doesn't blind you anymore it's like a
cool shock wave that's neat
that looks really cool they did a great
job with that
this would be embarrassing huh i mean
the door was already open
oh see ya
what the heck you made me use my
incredibly overpowered synergy you jerk
well it would be
okay it would be awesome if it also did
a ton of damage to this boss
i really want to go to the secret room i
don't think i can justify it
take auroboros it would be sec i'm going
to be honest i don't know what
the what auroboros does
and i don't consider to be an accurate
description
why not i mean we got 36 keys we're
chilling
how are you supposed to dodge that
oh i almost got out of it man
come on
okay that was spicy
that is playing super hexagon
i don't like the damage downgrade but
i'm extremely stoked
to have gotten an extra hard container
okay pill didn't oh the pill gave us a
demon heart
dude that's incredible
it's extremely valuable it works
okay oh yeah yeah okay so the the the
shots that i said you can't dodge that's
because they're ours
meme pills give you hp
i don't know what i was hit by but i'll
i take responsibility i take full
responsibility for it
i'm flooded there have been a a couple
of times
in in repentance where i've just been
like i have no idea
like i i just take damage and i'm like i
thought i was standing in like a super
safe place but apparently not
it's good and it happened to me in in uh
rebirth and after birth as well
it's just like what happens until you
get uh
until you get used to what's on the
screen
you know you gotta learn like all those
little edge cases
i do love that we can just destroy these
guys that makes life a lot easier
okay am i prepared for a boss fight
why not man why not uh
i'm gonna explore a little bit more i've
decided
apropos of nothing at all i've decided
that it would be
beneficial for us to do a little
exploration not related to the room i
just saw
just in general i think it's a failure
to plan as a plan to fail
what happened to mama mega uh so mama
mega at
i mean it appears that this is how it
works in this game too uh in
the dlc mama mega only works for one
floor
it's like super amazing for one floor
and then on the next floor you're like
i wish it was here okay we have nine
luck
algiz would go a long way right now man
two blood banks plus algaes thank you
thank you
it's tough to play both of those right
now but we'll we'll see
we'll see if we might be able to finesse
it
so it's not my first time on that but uh
on that boss that we're about to
approach
i did almost say on that bus that we're
about to approach
um we almost won yesterday i think it
was our first or second run
but the boss ended up just being a
little a little too difficult for us
i'd say our damage output is much higher
today
[Laughter]
uh hp i'm still kind of on the fence
dude guppy would really tie this run
together man
well we could take half damage from the
curse room but
son of a
well um
i think we just have to go i hate to say
it i think we gotta go
you blow these up
thought about the curse room decided
against it
i'm gonna take hanged man into the boss
fight
any chance you give me anything of value
okay literal money is not what i meant
but that's okay dude that's
really good and actually i'm very stoked
i got it now
instead of on the blood bank because i
would have used it on the blood bank
oh we don't want hanged man now um
when instead what i should be doing is
using it on the boss i think
it's one hp yeah and we're on like the
final room of the game
it's it's it matters man
we might still die but it gets us a
little closer
all right here we go here we go you know
how to dodge these
in in theory sonoma
only in theory unfortunately knives
coming out
when people get desperate the knives
come out there you go you never want to
snakes on a plane literally
geometrically speaking
you you never want to be up against the
wall
versus knives
you always want to give yourself some
verticality to dodge
okay not not my finest moment
all right we're toasted
say temporarily saved respond
hold on hold on
there's there's ways out
plus one to lowest stat okay it's
actually like a sizable damage
improvement
okay
then i'm like i'm trying to figure out
how we're gonna get through the cursed
room
because don't we take one full heart
from a hit
the problem is so we we if we walk in we
die
if we hanged man walk in
when we walk out we'll die but then we
could probably leave
if we go fast enough because of iframes
maybe we're going to die to the boss if
we don't try anyway so i think it's got
to be done
we're guppy so that's pretty sick um
and that's more hp that's actually like
a pretty realistic chance of victory i
would say now
oh it's true we could have bombed our
way out if we had to as well all right
so that
you know dying on that boss fight might
have been like the best thing we ever
could have asked for
unbelievably saved
okay then just be smart you got snakes
we got knives knives you want to be up
against the wall
but on the on the side instead of on the
bottom we love invincibility around here
flies are doing great work we're not
gonna lose
from making you know
mediocre dodges the only way we lose
here
is by really really throwing
by not making an effort by making poor
plays
i don't know what's happening
snakes many many many snakes
saved
okay this is like not dodgeable
uh by anybody except for me
okay didn't see that one coming
how are you alive just just asking
for a friend only a friend peter parker
he's dead he's dead he's dead confirmed
dead
my god okay all the achievements in
earth's history
have been unlocked guppy's eye
jacob and esau isaac's awakening a
strange door
seeing double
new cutscene new cutscene just dropped
edmond's been real quiet since this
stream
what are you started isaac let me see it
give it to me now
this is what you think of me
this is what i am to you a monster
no no mama after all
i've done for you bonk is how you view
me
you think i'm a monster isaac i'll
show you a monster
you are just like your
father i can't even look at you
the run was pretty pog though thought
the run was pretty
pog ending a little sag but the run
itself was
there was it was heavy on the pog right
ender engine thanks for the gifted subs
by the way
thank you
he's done it again guppy's eye has
appeared in the basement
you've unlocked jacob and esau you've
unlocked isaac's awakening you've
unlocked seeing
double you've unlocked a strange door to
the bank that appears in the depths
well i mean we gotta we gotta try the
new character



all right we're back with the a brand
new repentance run where kane
if you predict the item it's very simple
one thousand gift subs in chat
i'm gonna say it's nearsighted friend
okay that would have been devastating
i did not mean to say one thousand
i meant to say 100 1000 would have
scared the crap out of me uh
if we had actually gotten it correct i
felt my heart rate spike about 15
beats per minute i honestly got mildly
afraid
now you might have many questions about
this run you might say to yourself or
you might you might say
uh is he gonna do the alt path
it's been suggested is he gonna beat the
game on his very first attempt as kane
stranger things have happened um but
really like we're gonna do our best
and that's that's basically it we're
just gonna do our best
you know if if we can get the resources
required to go to the alt path and it
seems like we can survive on the alt
path
then we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
give it the old college try
like right off the bat you won't see
this play on any other twitch channel
nailed it crushed
like it or not you watched that's all
you could do thanks everybody
okay give me a slice of that
a key definitely makes the alt path
possible
loving the red fires hmm
he's ascended no pot is safe from him
anymore
seven cents we can't do anything man we
can't do anything
have you ever played a trick on somebody
for april fool's day
um i'm sure i have like for anybody
watching
later like uh
april fool's day is today i haven't uh
played a a prank on anybody recently i
find april fool's day this is not going
to surprise anybody who knows what i'm
you know like
i find april fool's day like really
annoying
that's not to say that there's not um
the occasional good april fools
that is like like what do i want out of
an april fools what what for me
personally makes a good criteria
it's a prank that gets you for a second
because it seems plausible
but doesn't alarm you you know like so
i kind of thought that like joke from
software one
was like pretty good today where they
were like they released that
apology about how like eldon ring was
canceled
and then there's like a finance youtuber
i watched who like
his video today was like finally
revealing my full
portfolio but actually it was about how
he was launching like a ponzi scheme
and i was like that's pretty clever and
like a lot of work went into this
but you know so many of the april fool's
day
hmm jokes are like
we're making a poop flavored beer and
i'm like no you're not come on
you're not making a poop flavored beer
you did it 30 years ago when you
invented
bud light
anyway oh we have fun here let's let's
go down a floor
um already making moves
so the the i actually can also pinpoint
like where i lost hope in in april
fool's day
it's when i was in like fourth grade
and the joke going around my playground
was about the russian
space station mirror
kid on my playground was like did you
see that the russian space station
uh crashed into the hotel do hospital
and i was like what and then he's like
april fool's and i was like guess what
i'm i'm done with this holiday now
i don't i don't respect it anymore
no mirror is a i keep saying it wrong
but it's it's a 90s thing
you couldn't shake a stick in the 90s
without hearing about the russian space
station
you pranked me you see i i saw in chat
somebody said uh
it makes uh luck foot makes all pills
positive now
april fools
i gotta tell you like the the front half
of the year
sucks for um holidays man
new year's day whatever okay after new
year's day
valentine's day look i'd celebrate
valentine's day
kate and i have a good time it's not an
inclusive holiday it's not for everyone
we're going left on this one
for sure right after that you get st
patrick's day
extremely fake holiday right after that
you get easter
good holiday but i wish they could just
pick a day that it actually like takes
place on
in may in canada we get victoria day
which is like basically just a holiday
to get
trashed and i think like i said this in
one of the isaac episodes coming to the
end of like uh
you know after birth plus is run i was
like come on
queen victoria she died like 130 years
ago or something like when are we gonna
reach the point
where we're just like i'm okay not
calling this victoria day anymore like
we we got
other heroes that we can acknowledge
okay queen victoria
we we can leave her in the past a little
otherwise like we're going to be
celebrating
victoria day in like the year 3000 i
don't think so man
like get her out of there i'm not even
saying necessarily because she has like
a problematic legacy or whatever i'm
just saying like we got to make some
space for
for modern heroes
in quebec it's patriots day you know
what
i'll give that some respect at least at
least you're you know it's acknowledging
the people instead of just like
you know some uh lady also known as the
queen i guess who lived in
england
i'll be honest as well i don't really
know what like queen victoria did for
canada
probably tricked a bunch of her people
into like moving here even though it was
like
inhospitable and frozen nine months a
year
there you go glenn gould day
one of canada's preeminent pianists
oh this is the greatest second room i've
ever seen in my life
no cap as the kids say what an
incredible room
i'm not used to being able to play uh
isaac with spirit hearts i did so many
bethany runs earlier today
yeah i say
[Laughter]
people complaining this dlc is too hard
um
try having the d12
it's easy i'm surprised there isn't don
cherry day
yeah it's pretty embarrassing uh
sometimes
like in in the mid 2000s they did a uh
like uh uh please vote for the greatest
canadian and then they had like a
reality show where they revealed the top
ten
and don cherry uh came in like seventh
he's literally just the guy that like
talks about hockey
in between the first intermission or in
between the first and second periods on
saturday nights
he was he was going up against like you
know the inventor of uh
cultivated insulin and you know the
father of socialized medicine and stuff
like that is so embarrassing
he should have been number one easily
[Laughter]
for going look at him look at him good
old good old frederick banting let's go
go saskatchewan boy invented insulin
let's go
okay this would be a great time to beat
the odds can i tell you
something incredible earlier today i was
recording an isaac run
this is not material to the actual like
outcome of the run please move
um but i had a
4.3 percent chance
of a deal with the devil and i got it
and the item inside of it was actually
good
one in 25 shot and we we picked the
right number it was pretty sick
all right i lost just an embarrassing
amount of hp we beat the odds yet again
though
i'll take it absolutely i know it's been
a little nerfed but i'll take it
i'm feeling somewhat solid in this run
feeling somewhat solid
excuse me i deal with lower rates in uh
gentian impact every single day
uh what's the company that makes that
called again
i always get it confused with the twitch
emote of like yaya
me me hoyo me hoyo get purchased by a
public company challenge 2021.
all right we're almost at conjoined
macros i think it's a a good
idea i think i i will consider doing
dailies in the future especially when we
have long isaac days
um but i'm not gonna do it today because
i've been burned by the april fools
challenge like
seven times
it's it's the only like unfortunate
timing day
so many times like the
okay that's good to know the april
fool's
uh daily is like hey april fool's the
game uh
i was gonna say the game isn't any fun
today
but you know it's like six times in a
row that is like you know
hey there's no items anywhere have fun
good one
good one very good one
hilarious nick cannon is hilarious
anyway
what was i talking about oh don cherry
yeah not not a huge fan
honestly
isaac though big fan there's been some
scuttle but you know
people called the the new game and and
or the dlc in the patch
at least a little over tuned a little
over difficult
um just wanted to see what we got here
to be honest i'd be inclined to say uh
might be a little tricky for sure but i
also feel like uh
it's one of those things hold on am i a
genius i want to try something here
i think it's one of those things where
like gamers including myself
are uh uh resin resin
are constantly like maybe this won't
work maybe i'll die on the way out but i
think it's worth a try nonetheless i'm a
genius i'm the smartest
uh person on earth i don't want oh wait
people said betrayal might be good now
let's give it a try
um i lived
i do have steam sale you're not wrong it
a it takes some getting used to
but b uh jar of flies is pretty sick too
a it takes some getting used to new
enemies shot speed etc etc
uh but b also like gamers are not used
to not doing things the hard way you
know what i mean
like i i was out here being like wow if
i can't even beat the game they'd
probably tuned it too difficult like
it's not that i'm the best player on
earth but i've played so much of it
that you would think that like the
average player is going to be in a
really tight spot
and i realized it's because like i've
still got got the muscle memory of like
oh yeah i'll always go the alt path
always
uh you know take almost every deal with
the devil that exists and you know
you're dealing with
antiquated pride and and information you
know i think
around launch leech is pretty sick too
dude around launch it might be more
sensible to play a little bit more
conservatively while we we build up
those muscles you know
i hear you
imagine them playing the old mafia city
of heaven game
i have no idea what you're talking about
but the reference is so
specific that i have an incredible
amount of respect for it
the the way that you approached it
i could not possibly relate to the joke
less but i'm like you sound like you
know what you're talking about for sure
now this is the risky part okay because
like we could die
we get hit twice here we die we probably
won't get hit twice against this
uh this enemy they need a better class a
criminal
but there's some bosses that could hit
us two times
dude this this was a very good mirror
dimension
no doubt about that i'm feeling
pretty solid here the only thing i'm not
solid on is hp
so they won't they won't let you go in
the boss room huh they will let you go
into the curse room
that's my heart rate again spiked the
shop on the other hand though
is um it's always empty in the mirror
realm
also i think blue fires are like less
likely to pay out
okay we're good let's leave that was a
very solid performance there i'm feeling
solid
what was i talking about a second ago
you know we got enough keys let's let's
go with the demon's tail
baby's good honest i recorded an episode
this morning
uh the episode is like an hour and six
minutes long
and the baby was calm and like cool and
collected for almost the entire thing
i was a very proud papa
key word almost well i mean at the end
of the day she's still a baby you know
like
what are you supposed to do sometimes
she you know
defecates in her own underpants and then
she she complains about it which seems
pretty fair to me honestly
yo i'll do mod thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
not dodged not dodged
okay things are going to be tough down
here
i was glancing you can't this game has
anti-glance tech now
we gotta try man
death card car battery i don't know if
it'll actually do anything with this but
it's a thought that counts
i'm gonna die 100 win rate i'm not gonna
die
it's not gonna happen we have demon tail
guaranteed
zero death incoming okay we're gonna die
i have a a piece of advice for you the
advice is never go
to alt floors it's uh
it's a fool's proposition
i'll see you never no
not not to a single enemy
not to a single enemy i refuse
yo thank you for the gifted subs as well
thank you
moving on we got golden bombs
just drop a gold in there and then get
the heck out of town this is how we do
it
i do the only problem is like i don't
know how we're gonna get
uh
spirit hearts you know when you need red
hearts
they're usually right around the corner
when you need spirit hearts it's tough
man
that doesn't help
tinted rocks if they still worked would
be uh would be an option for sure
i'm a doubter here i mean this one would
would pain me a great deal
because this should not be a doubter's
paradise
this is a great run where we haven't
really been that uh
that pressed we've taken uh some kind of
dumb damage
been living most of my life living in a
doubter's paradise well
honestly i knew it was called i got i
froze i
froze okay try again
that hurts sad sad sadga
uh free stigmata if we can get a bomb
that's pretty good
gift subs no we we covered at the top of
the scree
the stream today we're not doing the
gift sub there's a launch promotion only
please don't die on the first room
bailey thank you for the gifted subs
gotta change the title
i did before we started the stream today
would you believe it
[Laughter]
imagine not being here for the start of
the the stream
and still begging for gift subs man
that's gotta hurt that hurts the
streamer
you're a johnny come lately and you're
like give me some free stuff this isn't
costco
okay if it was you'd be welcomed here
120 volt
i don't know what it does yet but i'm uh
i'm eager to see y'all basic
thank you as well thank you this is a
great item
incredible item
stand close to enemies yo that's pretty
sick
yeah if you get a gift sub make sure to
uh
to say thank you to the gifter in chat
it's it's only polite
oh because the title says 100 win rate
no i i covered that on twitter the
like uh 100 win rate is true
because the asterisk in the title is if
you had a good time
then it's a win or if i had a good time
it's a win
generic mike thank you as well thank you
much appreciated
oh the gifter you mean uh jesus christ
one and the same my man one and the same
always one of the things that we do a
lot around here is
praise the lord
and many people have asked me to change
that they're threatened by it because
the specter of beelzebub is is
you know around the world you've seen
the little nos x juice you know
just just another example um but i will
not be threatened in the
into ending my agenda of praising the
lord
that's why we're playing isaac is to
bring awareness to satanic issues
it's a very fitting game
all right alt path because you have to
you have to go alt path man
i think we got to go left here dude
that's number two
on rooms where i don't understand
enemies or in a game where i don't
understand enemies at all
uh because they're all brand new highly
valuable
have you won a run in repentance yet
some of you were not here at the top of
the stream and it shows
we had we got the first streak in
repentance history
oh thank you nazu as well thank you
doubters have been real quiet
since this dropped i can't i gotta stop
saying that
i keep saying it constantly
along with uh ooh and also uh
really oh because it's an xl floor new
blank just dropped ooh
tough times never last only tough people
last
that was like terrible right there
oh it's pretty good it came along at a
at a good time in my life
uh as well dude we need consumables so
that's good
because the baby can participate as well
that's scary like many times we'll just
be
hanging out and the baby will be like oh
and then i go and then kate laughs and
i'm like i'm a genius
oh and it destroys chat oh no no no
don't don't have fun uh nobody can read
my essay
come on guys this look okay i'm sorry i
shouldn't have made the joke at your
expense i'm just
i don't consider myself a streamer i
consider myself a
vibe creator and i i like the vibes we
get from ooh
i think we need that right now
tinted rocks please
tinted rocks please
tinted rocks please
i said vibe creator not
vibrator you you got me confused with
some other streamers on this platform
okay we come on just give me a red heart
you got nothing for sale
i want it all man just say it it's mouth
you gotta try and then i want the other
one as well this is why we
saved up in our donation machine so much
man
we needed stuff like that really like
there's no there's no anything dude
is this a secret room it's not i guess
i'll die
then
okay that's a good point tough times
never last only tough people asked
let's try to find some secret rooms here
i did not hear the fart at first and i
almost died as a result
you know what you're a genius if you
became the lost
at this moment you could have two hits
instead
of one
that's kind of genius
that also seems like something that
could actually be super valuable like
like not just on this run but in general
he's done it never mind
yes thanks the streamer wins again
we did it the isaac flowchart undefeated
yeah use resin i don't think so how
about i just uh be good
gets bloated beautiful absolutely
beautiful
number two probably the highest win rate
item in the game
destroyed destroyed pageant boy
ultimate item really smart to take that
eternal heart right off the bat too
no item has ever been better than this
i gotta stop skipping those man there's
some people are gonna lose their mind
i gotta stop skipping the the boss cut
scene
mommy that's a mom's heart attack dude
i have done no damage to you that
doesn't seem right
help oh cause are you do you heal from
the bombs
oh no no no no no my eternal heart
i just want to live man okay so i can't
shoot bombs
so let's just tap fire instead that's
fun that's a fun
that's a fun time the occasional uh
dude we got to get these flies out of
here
thank you thank you he's he's sucking me
up
get closer no i'm not gonna get closer
cause
i don't know how to dodge his attacks i
i know we got the voltage
but i'm not confident standing near him
see like that he could just release a
completely innocuous fart on us at any
given moment
that's all right we're gonna get a great
item here probably belly button
is my guess have you learned any
isaac boss names this is uh yeah raw
mega i think
do you forget the deal with the devil
i'm just happy we like survived there
tears upgrades pretty nice don't get me
wrong
okay we're gonna do i think i'm capable
of
no i'm gonna be honest i don't think i'm
capable of
uh of beating the boss uh
as the lost
but i do think i'm capable dude i'm so
not used to being able to see the mat or
being able to see the map like every
single curse
is uh is like curse of the you don't
know where the hell you're going
what happens if you have two item rooms
in the mirror realm
one of them is empty the other one is a
key piece i guess
chat i'm off to play a prototype game
for work
see you later uh excuse me macros did
you
just drop baldur's gate 4
announcement in chat
did you just accidentally leak baldur's
gate 4 coming out
confirmed on on twitch.tv slash northern
lion balder's gate four
divinity original sin battle royale
edition
no april fools this time i was gonna say
we promise we won't cancel this one but
that's
that's too far i apologize i will say
though i was very much looking forward
to that x-com divinity and
and you larian studios broke my heart
but
okay we can beat this guy we if we get
an amazing item
maybe we could beat the other boss but
i'm not optim
off oh jesus christ okay start again
start again



i am excited uh it's finally happened
new cover art and then also we've
unlocked jacob and esau they got three
plus one
and the damage is one plus three i don't
remember
how to play them all i remember is that
there's
two different characters
if one of them dies they both die oh you
can't get them like
stacked on top of each other anymore i
vaguely remember that
you know what i do remember trying to
get them like separated and then picking
up
two rooms two items simultaneously
by like getting them uh just desynced
enough that you can actually walk into
the items
uh one at a time or or at the same time
i should say
that still works too now um
i mean i don't i don't think control
changes it at all
um
hold control oh if you hold control you
can move one at a time
i see i see so you could that's how you
could position for the double
item room yo so that makes like the alt
path um
kind of interesting huh
i wonder if i could pick it up whoa
screw
let's go mission accomplished um
so on the alt path you can pick up two
items
if you i'm like i'm losing my mind
trying to focus on this
uh you could pick up two items one of
them always being the question mark of
course
that's an interesting thing to think of
though we gotta try
speed i don't think it matters too much
um
let's just give it to esau yeah they got
individual stats
so the stat screen i don't think it's
gonna be like the most effective uh
visual indicator
oh come on man
it's not co-op this is the new character
it's pronounced esau yeah uh esau
jacob and esau got him okay
we're gonna pick him up we're gonna
launch him on the bus okay
this is co-op co-op forever alone
surely those shots won't hurt me i'm
willing to put it to the test
saved okay come on man send some shots
down here
let's go it's not nearly as good as i
thought it would be
i don't know like i've i i remember i
did play a lot of anti-birth
like i'm i'm starting to get some muscle
memory back
i i purged it from my memory but i i'm
starting to get some muscle memory back
we'll split those speed upgrades up
evenly so nobody gets uh offended
thinking their
dad's favorite
great damage good damage from the spider
there i appreciate it
keep it go my deal with the devil
tears upgrade goes to the stronger uh of
the two
which is uh horn lord
well done okay let's do some more
exploration first
he has horns
so far every streamer has complained
about this character i'm glad to see
you're a little bit more reserved
uh that's not my personality i merely
recognize
like that sometimes there's some
arbitrage to be had in the market
when the streaming index goes too angry
i i find that that's an opportunity for
me to double down on wholesomeness and
and pick up
some uh some arbitrage there
uh and when streamers get too wholesome
that's where i pivot a little bit into
anger
um but it's also never happened in
history so
i don't have to worry about that just
yet
strategically deployed wholesomeness
exactly
um i would like to open this golden
chest
no no no he lived
say a funny funny man uh little miss
muffet sat on a tuffet eating her curds
away
along came a spider sat down beside her
and gave her a bone of his own
hey pretty good
pretty good
24-hour band permanent i mean i feel
like the
jar actually could be useful here so
just
can we hold two active items
it doesn't matter i think the jar is
actually better
okay we can hold two actives
why don't you buy that and buying stuff
from the shop what year is it but still
you know it's it's important for us i
think to get these for hp
more more xd thank you for the
gifted subscriptions thank you heading
down to the next floor tomorrow you want
to leave huh going down to the next
floor
24-hour band permanent is a dan
soundboard clip that comes from the
soulsborne streamer also warzone
professional the happy hog
all right all right take a look take a
little breather
little sip of the bubbly can in the
frame can in the frame
okay here we go
unfortunately i'm realizing now wait a
minute how do i deploy the jar
hold control and press space maybe i
gotta test it
oh frick
nope you have to press q okay
all right thank you thank you gotta
press
q
i do think that bubbly and i'm being 100
serious
they should approach camp low
to get the song or the rights to the
song
bubbly because literally the start of
the song just goes like this
got the bubbly pulling through me got
the bubbly
pouring through me sparkling you know
like that's literally
that's what they sell man sparkling
water
it would be perfect it would be a
perfect fit
all right i'm about to become an angry
streamer
because we're gonna die as uh
esau which will end the run i'm sure
your perma band
there you go synced up synced up
come on man i don't i don't want to get
in there

sending you

a bomb now honey
dead bird irrelevant 24-hour band
permanent
this this character is going to throw
you for a loop but i pride myself on
having an above average amount of
neuroplasticity for a 32 year old man
we'll see
i think i got a chance
the bomb play disagrees oh yeah this is
doing numbers
what boss did you fight on the last
floor
ragman yeah
i've been i've been playing brain age
ragman and who uh
right it was an xl floor i recall this
it was little horn
confirmed brain is operating at 100
efficiency today
i will take why not he knows
he knows hold on where did i get 20
cents
okay maybe i shouldn't have said that
because i people thought i remembered
what was happening on this run
when did i get all that money though oh
you got a dime all right
take care of the dimes and the pennies
take care of themselves
a single key no two keys give me two
keys please we need to buy
a bomb we also need to purchase a second
key from the shop in order to
go to the shop because we have money but
then we also want to use the key to get
to the alt floor
maybe we won't go to the all floor on
this floor maybe we'll go to the all
floor on the next floor and we
will only get screwed if it's excel
that's not so bad maybe he can't even
get screwed if it's excel i don't know
man
yeah yeah the streamer sees the copy the
copy pasta i don't know
you know what is it gonna take man
what's it gonna take to
to get it to stop i've seen it though
like you're doing right now
say electrical inference etc etc like i
don't know
i don't know what you're looking for man
except for a 24-hour ban permanent
you know what hold on wheel of fortune
how do we use wheel of fortune hold this
then hit q
how does one use the the card
oh the first shop's open
you're absolutely right x
no doesn't x mean that it's the tenth
tarot card
yeah yeah it's the tenth tarot card
i'll take a little stem sale no doubt
about it
it's control space
okay you need like a steel battalion
controller to to play this
i don't understand
plug in the hottest i still got the
logitech plugged in
get ready to run
i i held control as if i would become
esau and i did not
i got it backwards sorry we split it
though
i'm going down yeah yeah cause we can't
get a key anyway or we're not likely to
get a key
mom turns mom says it's my turn to get a
spirit heart
i gotta i mean the only thing i'm
thinking here is control space it is
control space how about that
who would have thought oh baby two
trinkets
dead bird and eve's birdfoot
we're saved man officially saved
mods appreciate you appreciate you
don't hesitate like dude honestly like
the more bands you give out
the more i get to do on band requests
and then like double mind the content
it's basically like a dream come true
i've still i haven't read apollo's ban
uh on band requests i like to start my
morning by reading them when i get a
chance but
um i didn't get a chance this morning
unfortunately but
i guarantee they're gonna be good we
might as well give this to
you um because like yesterday was the
first day of the new among us map
there's gotta be
like i i don't even wanna know what kind
of terrible stuff went on in the band
request yesterday
we're gonna get some like self-aware
band requests i'm sure as well like
people are gonna get banned and then the
on band request is gonna be like
i got caught up in the excitement
thinking i would get on the stream for
on band requests but i didn't realize
that he wasn't gonna do it for six weeks
and now it's two weeks later and i can't
chat i thought he was gonna do the unban
requests right away
just chill out you know pop a squat get
a snack
if you if you're bored and you got a
copy pasta like you could just
here's my advice you know like go get uh
an
open a notepad document and just uh
ctrl c ctrl v into the the notepad
document over and over
you'll get the same level of streamer
interaction
and and you won't have that that regret
hangover in the morning
okay this was a very good floor uh
we don't have immediate health concerns
so red you take
and you take the spirit hearts as well
i would say both even though you have
the respawn i would say both
and then this is bad
let's get deals with the angel we do
kind of want to take the alt path
but
[Laughter]
i don't know we got to get a key first
before we worried about uh before we're
worried about that okay there's a key
check this out and check check this out
check check check out my melody
run
dude yeah i think esau is pretty strong
now
what was that devil deal that was it was
terrible man
like
i can't believe it the quarter and ouija
board
that's like a flash devil deal
the burpee cloth okay i will give it to
you i have to warn you
there is a little coffee spilled on this
side
but it should be clean enough for her to
throw up on it
i mean you got to keep it in perspective
right
what was the last boss you defeated
come on man i can't remember that
that was that was seconds ago
i don't want to constantly be uh
attacked on my memory here like that's
that's too much
in order for the the banter to flow the
memories gotta go
you know you can only choose a few
things everything's got trade-offs
i'm here to tell you though i have a
real uh opinion on memory
now my opinion on memory is valueless
because i'm not like a cognitive
scientist
or a neurologist or anything i i do
definitely think your memory gets worse
as you age
as you age due to like philosoph
physiological changes
okay however i also think one of the
reasons
that your memory gets worse as you get
older
is because you actually just have stuff
going on in your life whereas like
you know when you're like 14 years old
it's a lot easier to remember things
because
you know you've like your life is low
event for the most part
like i think the reason that adults have
run into trouble
a lot of the time is you know memory
wise because of the fact that they've
like oh
and then i gotta oh we got to renew our
car insurance on the weekend and then we
got to do
i've got to get dinner tonight but oh i
didn't get the artichokes so i got to
stop by the grocery store on the way
home
uh and then also like you know blah blah
blah you get the idea and plus i'm going
to work you know i forgot to respond to
that email
etc etc um whereas like when you're uh
well at least when i was like 16 it was
like a get on the school bus at
like 7 45 a.m and then you know
just go to your classes and then you're
pretty much set honestly my man you're
pretty much set
okay check this out check this out
you put this guy over here
you walk him down and then for the price
of one bomb
we get a secret room and a spear spirit
heart
well well well
it's a good idea though you got to admit
and then hold on i mean if you're going
to use one bomb
you might as well do this right like
look at he's a genius man he's the
smartest gamer
yeah yeah yeah we'll do it
now we have no bombs unfortunately
though um
what about the 70 year old who has
nothing to do well again
you know i baked that in earlier with
physiological changes of course
but then secondarily i also think that
like when you're older
it might be nice to just okay i'm
phrasing but like remembering
minor things who needs it man you're
like i already went through the
workforce
now i'm retired and you know it's time
for me to just get like
lazy
you know if i'm 70 and they're like hey
well you know oh would you have for
lunch last thursday i'd be like i don't
need to
i don't need to know that anymore
i filled up my rrsp i i did my time
i paid my taxes and now now it's time to
just live day to day
help help me
should we have elective officials over
the age of 70.
um yeah
for sure um i'm being very serious about
this
obviously i think i think that it should
we should go back to like the roman
consul system there should be the
the only leaders of the free world
should be
the oldest living person because they've
got the most experience
and the most recent baby born because
they have the freshest perspective
okay check this out you ready for this
kate
you ready for this
[Laughter]
gaming
you see everybody in chat going no no
that's not how it works
embarrassing
they i agree honestly they're so easy to
say
like they say no without even thinking
about it
they never say whoa and honestly that's
one of the big problems with today's
society i think
hello baby
oh what kind of outfit she got on today
oh look at that
how do uh if people are watching from
home how do they cop the fit
cop the fit
if they're watching from home how do
they cop the fit how do they buy it
yeah like you know steal this look
go to the baby store and buy it go you
heard it here first go to the baby store
and buy it
oh uh chariot sucks my mistake chariot
officially
bad i'm trapped in in a nightmare
okay what if you have two cards how do
you use
the the esau card if it's not control
space
it's there's so many buttons man
it's control q okay okay sure
i got it i get the picture dude i'm
telling you
like this is gaming
officially gaming
whatever he got his hp back and we got
the second secret room
don't care didn't ask plus i got the
second secret room
well we don't even need to use a bomb
here i feel like i've seen this dlc
about
uh four or five years ago well you know
kate
you know what we don't need right now is
more negativity around
after waiting uh seven years for the
final isaac dlc to come out a little
more
negativity about it
i don't think that's necessary
insubordinate and churlish
wait a minute wait didn't i
i think i fought this boss four seconds
ago
did i not just fight this boss
[Laughter]
it's a rematch oh okay how about that
well flush him again there he goes get
flushed
way to go dummy you just got flushed
great item pretty excited um
kate i don't want you to weigh in by the
way on the discussions that we're having
about uh
whether or not i have dementia i do
i do forget things from time to time
but in my defense some of the things
that i forget
i don't really like want to remember
i i do think we're probably gonna die
right here by the way we're gonna give
it a try regardless
pov you are poop in the turret
this will work i'm dumb
saved
anyway i forgot what i was saying
oh sometimes i don't want to remember
yeah because it well i don't know like
sometimes
and don't uh take this the wrong way
kate but sometimes you'll like tell me
something
but you'll nest it inside of a story
and it just doesn't fit in my brain that
way like if you're telling me a story
and then like halfway through the story
you're like
it's like a trap you're like by the way
remind me at 11 13 tomorrow i gotta call
like the hair salon
and then you keep going on with the
story like by the time the story's over
i've already forgotten
the the thing i was supposed to remind
you
i don't think his dad brain i think it's
like you you try to hit me with like a
brain teaser
i'm dead i'm gonna die i'm dead dude
this isn't
i'm alive i'm the lost
well i might as well try to fight the
boss
head eyes
that's now this because we had lazarus
rag dude i'm a genius
be flipping yeah yeah they're like
all right get ready
i was looking up like baby milestones
this morning
because i was like i want to know like
how how she's doing relative to other
babies and it was like 10 milestones
your baby must meet
and she crushed it she was like it was
like at two months they should look you
in the eyes and i was like
done and it was like i have four months
like they should respond to
when you smile that was like easy and
i think it was like at six months she
should uh
i forget like like grasp things with
their hand and i'm like come on
yeah in the 1200s or are you talking
about elo
firm handshake that's that's next firm
handshake
that donkey that donkey donkey dunk
it's easy i can tell you what boss i
fought i don't remember their name
but it's uh bad uh
poop i can tell you because i fought
that boss
three boss fights in a row for some
reason
hello oh what a cute baby
what the cute baby
where am i going oh well
please
oh you tried to buy some netflix stock
yeah okay
yeah you got to be uh you know careful
with stuff like that because if you put
the wrong
uh you put like one extra zero on your
limit buy you could accidentally pay
like
10 times what a stock is worth
or sell it for uh one tenth of what it's
worth is the alternative but
what what has you uh feeling positive
about netflix kate because i gotta tell
you i'm in the opposite camp
well but if i tell you how many people
are watching this
this might be a i don't think that that
enough people are watching this to
materially move
the position of netflix stock actually
but between you and me or between you me
and chad
yeah sure why not so
just last year
okay did they buy the penthouse is the
penthouse coming in netflix korea
but then uh they're very investing 51
million back
into like the growing netflix korea
okay you're like those pubs that you can
create like a studio
okay
i uh you know i think there's a chance
for netflix to to get stronger in korea
every time i open the app it shows in
languages that i don't speak
tomorrow you can't get in the chords man
i uh my personal opinion on netflix is
netflix uh
bad disney plus uh pog
but if they make a queen's gambit too
perhaps i might consider uh reinvesting
if you have thoughts on this subject
oh you know what
yeah it's like 400 bucks right 500 bucks
whoa wow
by the way this run is like toasted it's
going nowhere
i gotta i gotta focus a little bit more
on the run or
like i'm i'm definitely just gonna like
afk
idle myself into oblivion
i don't know how we're making it out of
this one
okay goodbye baby
bro i'm gonna die i also have no idea
like because i just took amnesia did i
even see the item room on this
floor was it uh was it my best friend
whatever just kill me
[Laughter]
okay sure yeah you can summon spikes
from the ground and all that okay cool
cool cool all right
well let's run it back try it again



i like the idea of this character
that's not even meant to be like
facetious like i think there's some cool
mechanics
you know like getting two bombs for the
price of one is pretty sick
very difficult as well though i did
somebody
it was mur salty on on twitter they were
like you gotta go back to fortnite look
at this abomination they just added
and they added um they call it diamond
hans
it's
the stonks guy from the meme you know
like the guy
the guy with the smooth head that's in
the suit going stocks
so you could have diamond hans
and uh and the alien xenomorph and
chun li on a squad together
and then when you win you could all do
the orange justice together which is and
and kratos and the mandalorian yeah
i don't know i think it's kind of sick
my my uh judgment on that is that i
think it's kind of sweet
i mean they've really like just gone oh
my god
just do it man they've they've gone
fully into like
you know absurd like fan service
territory
it's money equals power that's
incredible and
i'm kind of here for it honestly
they've gone country now if they could
just make the
uh if they can make the default mode
no building
that i would i it could become my main
game
no sweat mode yeah you know what i mean
this stonks guy
that guy stonks
i did see that that netflix bought
knives out
two and three for 400 million dollars
it's a lot of money for sure but i think
it's uh
i i here's the thing knives out one
fun movie had had a good time watching
it and i could totally see how they
could use um
you know that as a platform to kind of
launch a franchise of
daniel craig's character
i'm willing to give it a try at least
for sure
why not
why is everything got to be a franchise
not everything you know maybe just like
just knives out
whatever you're just gonna you know
download it off the pirate bay anyway
what are you complaining about
oh i wish they made more uh original ips
for me to steal
what the heck is soap
hold on maybe it's hp tears and shot
speed
i don't mind having that on non um
non bomb man
i think i'm gonna go
i think i'm gonna do normal path
realistically
i don't think we're gonna live on
non-normal path
i think it's good for us to go this way
instead we would
we would definitely get double items if
we went
uh alt path but
i think we just need to get some stuff
knocked off the post-it note get some
confidence
get some you know momentum get some
familiarity
okay this is an important one
[Laughter]
this should go to you
are you gonna watch
kong vs godzilla i i
saw godzilla
2014.
short fuse faster explosions that seems
terrible
or awesome i don't know uh i i saw
half of skull island
and was like this seems okay
help i saw half of
uh godzilla king of the monsters and i
said this does not seem like it's my cup
of tea
so i think i will skip godzilla versus
uh
versus kong i'm not i'm not the target
audience
is it on streaming services though i saw
some people in the u.s watching it on
their home
entertainment systems it's on hbo max
oh yeah i got hbo max
i still probably won't watch it but
well it's not hbo max here it's crave i
got nothing against it's just not my cup
of tea you know
it's not never i've never found uh never
found myself
involved in the in the the kong fandom
or uh godzilla for that matter
i believe is good don't get me wrong why
does some minecraft streamer i've never
heard of have 200 000 views
because you're old like and i don't mean
that in a negative way
at all but i had the exact same
experience myself
i don't know maybe like a month ago
there was a streamer
that i've never heard of they were live
they had
200 000 viewers and they were the
subscribers
were coming in so fast nobody could type
in chat
and i said to myself for a brief moment
i said how do i not know i've never
heard of this person before
and it's it's very simple they're like
18 and you're probably like in your late
20s and the internet's big
and you know it's uh
there's a whole new crop uh you know
streamer idols coming out
okay give me stopwatch give me spirit
heart
it's impossible to keep uh to keep up
with it i promise you
you just got to pick this this the part
of the internet that you're like uh
a fan of and and just you know stay
i mean you could always you know grow
like get new experience and stuff like
that but
i did have a dream that i made friends
with one of the minecraft
uh youtubers i have no idea which one it
was
i'll leave that up to dreamlands
but i just remember being like you know
in the dream i was like hey
cool minecraft
[Laughter]
yeah it was it was it was sips for sure
his name is sips homing familiars
you wanted to do the normal path
don't make fun of me i'm old also this
runs easy now we'll win
no problem i need the double items
this is the shop
the tower no thank you
yeah sips is a he's an og minecrafter
man
no no doubt about it
if anything in the dream i should have
given up my friendship slot
that's just not the right way to phrase
that
i should have given him the opportunity
to uh
be friends instead of me but
okay this this deal with the devil could
be
could be important hold on empty vessel
on uh on esau
that's that's top tier he's gonna get a
lot of invincibility now
um
i don't know i don't think we need the
book of belial one moment please i have
i have so many
unread messages on discord holy cow
all right i mean that's a that's a lot
of messages i'll respond to that later
i'm not gonna read all that uh
but sorry that happened to you or
congratulations or whatever
one of my favorite memes you know what
uh what april fool's prank i'm the most
annoyed by
and i get that this is like extreme old
energy
but like every year there's like a
streamer that is like i don't know how
to say this but and then it's a twit
longer link and then the twit longer
link is like
gotcha that's the one that one drives me
crazy man
no not bears i don't know if his was on
april fool's day so
and you know i give him a little bit of
credit
yeah it's like ah you thought i was i
did something bad but actually
it's just a joke
i can't get these characters stacked up
man
they've got different movement thanks to
empty vessel
can i i'd just like to get in the item
room save me please
i don't think i don't think it's
possible man
okay wait wait i've got an idea okay it
looks like this
wait the bomb's probably gonna come down
right no okay i know exactly what to do
here okay
and then hold the button as fast as you
can
we did it oh god but he got cursed to
the tower that's terrible news
all that work just to get curse of the
tower
heavy f yeah flying appears unaffected
by the uh by the water
plus we got faster explosions curse of
the tower is good
funny meme very funny meme that you've
said there
no i'm not going into the mirror now i
like on this run i think with any other
i mean you got to do it at some point to
get the key piece
but i'm not gonna do it um right now
oh tomorrow you'd like to come in huh um
just because uh
i think we're gonna we're gonna get hit
and die for sure
okay come on come on come on in buddy

our runs yesterday how how quickly
people forget man
but on the uh oh uh not uh
edmund on the podcast said it would be
good come
on man who are you going to trust about
something isaac related
me or the guy who made the game
[Laughter]
easy decision
well i would say already today
the stream has been good hit good hit
has been a success
simply because of the the unlocks we got
you know and and particularly the new
character but
i'd like to make it even more successful
if possible
fate's reward and the body now that's
good eats

that's a big item and then i don't even
know what this does
teardrop charm i can't shoot anyway but

but i i do not like when the mayonnaise
is in the driver's seat
and on chicken salad the mayonnaise is
honestly is like elon's self-driving
algorithm
because it's driving and also driving
badly
going over the lines and
can't make a left turn when the sun is
like you know facing the direction of
the windshield
i see progress has been made today don't
patronize me
corey rude
look who decided the adult today it's
so rude man
look who decided to come out of his cave
not patronizing i was mad at this game
last night
okay fair enough i i apologize
what the uh spikes man who made this
yo it's easter this weekend huh what's
up with that
i'm gonna die
it's what yeah like you know what i mean
like it's easter dude
that's crazy what do you mean what's up
with that
well i mean what i said dude what's up
with that
who decided on that one
jesus no that it's bs man okay this
battery pack
also confirmed not very good
but isn't like i really just wish
i'm being straight up i don't know maybe
you have some insight corey on this one
why don't they just make easter like the
the third of april every year or
something like that
why do we have to go through an
algorithm
every year just to understand what day
easter is
this but for all holidays because it has
to be on a sunday
okay could you make it just like the
first sunday in april then
like why why is it sometimes in april
and sometimes in march
i'm not trying to cause problems here
but like when jesus you know
uh rose himself from the dead was he
like
did he put it like into a reverse
engineer
and go like uh
you know oh well let me find some
arbitrary rule
it's the third monday unless there was a
quarter moon
it's never in march you guys are
actually crazy
it's in march there have there have been
easter's in march
you know what let me i'm gonna look it
up here
when is easter
okay sunday how is easter's date
determined
it always comes the first sunday
hold on always
occurs the first sunday after the pascal
full moon
the first full moon that appears
after the vernal equinox which signifies
the beginning of spring in the northern
hemisphere
actually the dumbest way to
uh predict a holiday i've ever heard in
my life
truly insane what is this like saturn
alia
i need bomb synergies dude this could be
sick i do need to find a way to kill you
first though
okay here we go
let's go
[Laughter]
that's huge okay control space
very natural keyboard maneuver there to
get that out there hey
lucky penny dude no complaints
that was easy much easier than expected
but like there have i i mean i remember
that's not a great source
dude just trust me there have definitely
been
easter sundays in march
i'm not saying it's common but
it's happened easter was march 27th in
2016.
this one goes out to everybody in chat
who just typed five question marks
maybe maybe they weren't alive back then
we got a lot more viewers than usual
it's possible we got a different
audience
excuse me
rabbit's foot panic button push in case
of emergency i will not
my birthday falls around easter oh were
you born
on the 40th day following the vernal
equinox which signifies the start of
spring
in uh the northern hemisphere your
driver's license must be like the size
of a damn billboard
name john last name doe
uh date of birth you may want to sit
down for this one
okay i have no idea what that item is
it's a red balloon
like from i think you should leave
bring back decimal weeks
okay vasculitis clogged enemies and also
anarchist cookbook like this is now just
reaching comical levels
that might be the funniest joke i've
ever heard remember when that guy asked
me to do a funny let's just pretend that
instead of um
what i said which was an andrew dice
clay joke
let's just pretend that i said that cool
joke about like when that guy was born
instead
because that would be that was much
funnier for sure
i don't really like dull razor here i'm
just being straight up with you
that was just really bad
dull razor is just gonna trigger curse
of the tower more often
what the which is the exact opposite of
what i want i wish i'd never gotten the
item in the first place
oh it hurts daddy when you say that
nl i tried to listen to joanna newsom
but she's not on spotify what the heck
man
yeah i don't know she doesn't like
spotify um
which i i don't get me wrong i can
understand
but the thing that surprises me is that
she she's not down with spotify
but she's totally on youtube music and i
i'm kind of like i don't want to say
that because i don't know if she knows
that she's on youtube music
and i like to listen to her songs so i
don't want to like blow up
my own spot you know what i mean
well this was a very solid boss fight i
thought we did a great an admirable job
here
here we go again corey you got something
to say
what is it is it bone marrow is it
brittle bones
is it calcium is it uh you're the expert
this is a call back to yesterday
small bony hp up i believe this is one
empty bone heart
nl merch just arrived yo dhl has been
real quiet since the nl merch arrived
or something
yeah so like not all of the merch is
shipped
so if your merch has not gotten shipping
info don't sweat it
there's still there's still a ways to go
uh tiny still is still working the
the printers in overtime you know the dj
khaled
meme where he like you know it's like i
called apple to get more servers
just pretend like that's real and that's
what i did
tiny boop squig shorterly exactly
i ordered from dan giesling.shop and
mine arrived early yo that's i'm stoked
that's great news little life hack for
you
okay i don't know like you know what
let's just i don't want you to lose your
bone hearts
and this guy gets invincibility so let's
try it this way
how's bubbly going i'm glad you asked
delicious
i wish i had given up the hp from the
other character
no i stood still too long i was just i
was thinking i was just thinking
can you see what i'm doing man
oh geez
when do you eat lunch since you stream
from 10 to four
or 11 to four um i i
usually i'll try to eat lunch around
like 10 45.
um
that was a surprise uh
so at 10 45 this morning i had uh
i had chicken cashew curry really hits
the spot
one of my favorite morning meals we're
so dead like i mean
i i guess what i want to ask is like how
is a human being supposed to handle this
room
because it it seems absolutely
impossible
uh control q
control q he's done it control q
confirmed undefeated
yeah curse of the tower is good now by
the way
in case you missed the memo
i could i could gamble a little
i'm not making fun of ed at all i feel
like you know
ed should think that his the items he
made are good
he's you know he's like a proud papa but
i
am making fun of the people who
uh believed him
[Laughter]
okay hold on this room could change
everything ooh papa
okay hold up hold up this is big
uh scary man you must
purchase the spear at heart
the shop is kind of hard to navigate
with two characters
oh i bought the stars card accidentally
okay that's fine
um and then why don't you
also get pandora's box i got no idea
what the heck's
going on that's not how you do that okay
that's my mistake
here we go
let let the fun begin um okay
so it's ctrl control q
i want the nine volt on you which
doesn't even make sense but
um it's just q
just q yeah okay four spirit hearts
that's that's solid
oh i didn't want you to take that
okay saved member card has appeared in
the basement i guess because i bought
out like a whole shop
please place temperance down on the
ground
and then explode it
and then we're gonna hit control q
i don't know what's happening
q control q control space
control just q just q
control q okay you hit control q
blow yourself up accidentally
control q he's done it
okay um this is not
bad
ankh and d8 okay the d8 is not
what you're looking for as uh
when you're predominantly using bombs to
accomplish your task but
it could be worse like it's it's pretty
stunning to me that we're like
still alive it's so hard to dodge
oh what oh he can't fly anymore because
he has the bone heart i'm stupid
we still needed the hp but it's a very
tough run to win as
it's all so tough like i'm just being
honest on this one it's kind of tough to
maintain focus on these like insanely
long runs
part of the problem is i've you know
been streaming and talking as well but
whoops
and glancing and reading
and etc etc but
okay you don't have to dodge the red
bullets that's good to know that's good
to know
have you ever noticed that every
streamer and i don't just mean me when i
say this for once
have you noticed that every streamer
says everything twice
matter who i watch they repeat what they
said
two times i think every streamer on this
platform
myself included has been getting away
with
half banter for years just padding the
content
i only recently noticed this
diluted banter yeah man it's like a dupe
banter
if you if you want to ruin every
streamer's
uh mental health which i don't support
you doing this by the way but
just start pointing out how often
streamers say things two times in a row
you'll probably just get banned 24 hours
permanent but
because i i don't think they're gonna
take it nicely mausoleum too
just be like yeah you already said that
control q
q control space
i'm okay with this i know you're gonna
say like the emperor play
i really just wanted to get like a
possible deal with the devil
it won't happen anyway because we're
about to the whole freaking floor is
about to be swallowed up by bombs but
just run again i'm just like i'm just
asking questions here is a human being
supposed to be able to
realistically like
do anything on these rooms
[Laughter]
it's impossible man oh you you just
gotta tank them i think it's your only
hope
why not right
okay we're still alive
mausoleum is just insane dude
no i refuse to let you say curse of the
tower saved us
that's that's you've
you've twisted the narrative
it did the damage output is crazy
unfortunately about 20 percent of the
damage was directed towards us
q control space
control q done
easy mode
the muscle memory i'm sure it's going to
become second nature at some point
for now it's still it's still a little
rough like trying to use these items
you're not right it's like rocket
science
you trying to use a consumable it's like
liam neeson when he calls
the the kidnapper in taking one
good luck good luck good luck good good
luck
good luck good luck good luck
what are you talking about you haven't
seen taken one
it you don't have to see it's not very
good but
when he he does that famous phone call i
don't have money
what i do have a very particular set of
skills
skills that would make me quite annoying
for a man like you and then um
the the guy on the other end just like
laughs at him and says good luck
and then liam neeson goes on a travel
montage where he's like you know
traveling to
southeastern europe and just the echo of
that man saying
good luck just keeps playing over and
over in his head
it's quality filmmaking
you've unlocked double baby he's done it
yeah then he says tough times never last
only tough people last
for example so to speak
we got ourselves a double baby
starting to look like it might even be a
triple baby
could you repeat that uh tough times
never last only tough people asked
what's the best i can do
just thank you thank you
you already said that oh crap it got me
i i can't believe i invented like
anti-streamer technology
over the course of the stream like way
back in the day
i i came up with anti-streamer tech it
was going into a streamer's stream
and then just typing in chat is this
sponsored it was the easiest way to
annoy streamers of all time
it took over the site like uh like the
gray goo hypothesis of nanotechnol
nanotechnological armageddon uh
excuse me a semiconductor gotta gotta
damarang
um i vowed never to use my power for for
evil ever again
and here i go saying uh
you know start start telling streamers
they already said that and and watch the
fireworks
control space
think fast
you you can't hurt me with control space
you can't hurt me with is this a
sponsored stream because i'm the only
person with an
uh with the antidote the antidote is
saying i wish
if you say i wish then you're uh you've
neutralized it
but many people don't know about this
power
okay we like the swap here
empress card that's fine
that don't you have to dodge those you
don't have to dodge those
i gotta remember you don't have to dodge
those
why would saying is this sponsored
bother people back in the day
um sponsored deals for influencers were
very few and far between
so a lot of streamers like to think that
the fact that they were never getting
offered them
meant that they had some ethical
superiority over
people that um did get offered them
and as a result calling their integrity
into question with no evidence
whatsoever you know who would have
thought it kind of bothered them
it bothered me that's why i came up with
it in the first place
and it's why i vowed to not uh
to not use my power for evil ever again
now sponsored deals are are so regular
they're so normal
that you can just be like i wish and i'm
telling you that i wish is a perfect
anecdote
you already said that yeah it's a vod
dummy
back on top okay this room cannot be
completed by i'm just dead i
there's no escape for me i will just
continually be sucked into the portals
for the rest of my days
that room cannot be defeated as those
characters
there is no hope
oh son of a
yeah the mods have been doing a great
job we love the mods
the only time i've been mad at the mods
is when toasty
almost he said we should play an april
fool's day prank in the discord today
that made me think long and hard about
the types of characters i've been
associating with but
we got it sorted out no harm no foul
hold on okay we're gonna pop algaes
immediately
that's going to be control space we're
going to control space when we enter the
room
then we're going to control q yeah yeah
yeah yeah he's so good
now just get just chill just chill man
you're doing great
never take damage ever again thank you
glitter bombs
i think we're gonna win this run and i
the the thing is when we win this run is
gonna be very complicated for me because
i'm also like
gonna have to remember that somehow
i have to win like against the the final
boss
as this character which seems not
possible
now if don't don't try to april fools me
mouth comes into chat he says lol ed
said next patch is gonna nerf more items
look you really expect me to believe
you're you're following the isaac patch
notes
come on man
be reasonable
the hanging man
not memes i think it's memes i think
mal's the kind of guy
who would say not memes and then be like
gotcha
he'll he'll win by any means necessary
all right so let's get insanely weird
here
i'm gonna pick up all items
as jacob and then i am going to
re-roll and see what my shots look like
hard to tell and the stat screen is
indecipherable
[Laughter]
let's re-roll all of our stats
we have book of virtue that's
interesting
i think you might have ruined the run
nl's been real quiet since new zane
dropped
oh papa tough times never last
only tough people last
[Applause]
yes sir can i get a bacon egg and cheese
salt and pepper ketchup mayo on a roll
yes sir you already know the vibes
forget the bev you know i gotta cop to
arie yes sir
he's gone mad this is what like hours
and hours of streaming the same game
will do to
a an individual like mouth i don't know
how you did it with that craft man
i already did this bit uh simpsons did
it
remember that i'm ready for more dad
craft
yeah you and the guy in my chat who
keeps taking like passive aggressive
shots of me
for saying that i dreamed that i was
friends with a minecraft youtuber and
they said oh did you quit their server
in two days as well
so so needlessly hostile
to be honest you have to have a very
high iq to understand the simpsons
to be honest you have to have a very
high iq to understand the simpsons
you already said that oh okay sorry
we're just we're
just spitballing right now i'm just
waiting till my next re-roll so pick
this up because it's not good and then
we'll re-roll it
mouth who are the jets
getting at the trade deadline
are they gonna are they going all in are
they going yolo
okay this actually seems good
we got soy milk death's touch
people want savard or ekholm
i need to watch um
more hockey than just canucks games i
don't know who either of those
individuals are
hold on hold on
hold on hold on
question mark
control space he's done it
teardrop charm
i don't know if this is good but we're
still going
double last i'm seeing double four lusts
four lusties
to be honest you have to have a high iq
to understand the simpsons
i did see like i was wondering why the
canucks had not played in so long like i
hadn't really been following the
the team because they hadn't been doing
a great job lately and
i considered it a waste of my time to
watch the games
i guess they uh had like a week off and
then
also got covered so like you know if the
season wasn't already a little uh
busted i yes it got
got even more busted
kate please come and reboot your husband
yeah i need a
firmware update please kate
uh spacebar thank you
please just let me fight the boss i mean
you know what it is i'm actually like i
can maintain the illusion of coherence
for like
40 minutes when an isaac run is like i
mean this one's 42 minutes long but the
clock lies to you we've probably been on
it for like
60 minutes like that's where i lose my
mind
this is where i lose my mind
jacob's ladder seems pretty good it's
going to be a shame to reroll it
what percentage of comments do you read
i mean the honest answer is probably
like
i bet it's like 20 straight up
which seems i don't know i don't maybe
it seems low to you it seems pretty high
to me
it's not that hard to read so many
comments though because like you really
pick up the vibe of them pretty quick
like every once in a while you start
reading the comment and you're like this
is gonna be a funny joke that i can
steal
um but the rest of the time it's ooh
papa uh yes sir etc etc you already know
the vibe
you already said that you forgot a
single penny
14 rooms ago once you kind of get all
the genre
you can fill in the blanks for yourself
after you uh
after you've read them after you've read
like the first word
am i correct by the way somebody told me
that uh
and somebody was invicta that ma of the
void no longer gives a damage upgrade
and also
no longer generates uh
demon hearts rude
honestly just quite rude
yes sir got me
well i i hope
we can maybe put the uh
the lost in the corner because i i
really don't
see myself being able to dodge
i'm gonna give you the piercing shots
honestly
but if you just oh you know we don't
want to have you at the forefront
we want to have you at the back front
content is enjoyable poggy
we got the seal of approval the chat the
chat champion has spoken
i can't even see the other character man
what happened is that my peeper's eye
he was eaten by the larger baby oh you
mean draw scalar
we were on a break
jerry rachel's uh rachel
all right um somehow he's done it
i we've unlocked birthright i don't
understand
how it happened but but it has come to
pass we gotta win
we're three hours into the stream this
is my second slash



well the the rumors of my death have
been greatly exaggerated
we're gonna try the bloody mary
challenge again which is like
insanely difficult but that's what's fun
so for anybody that didn't see yesterday
we did unlock a few more by the way but
um the bloody mary challenge
every floor uh that you play
except for the first floor you go down a
half of a heart upon your uh
your entry to it now i gotta tell ya
do you think it's possible that sack
alter
will sack the knife and we'll be safe
nope unfortunately no
that would have been sick though
so i think i'll keep this because you
never know there's a lot of familiars in
this game that i wouldn't mind turning
into devil deal items
i think you've gotta have like a pretty
special run
in order to win this challenge so i
think you you take like low percentage
high reward plays i think you worry
about that more than like oh you could
have improved your run slightly by doing
this this or this
there's an omega tinted rock where
am i being trolled right now trollin
is it because this looks like a super
tinted rock
that's that's funny
[Laughter]
i saw it and it's real in the corner
room chad it's april fool's day
you wouldn't try to try to
engage in a ruse against me on april
fool's day would you plus it's
afternoon unless you live in like
old zealand like
i don't think you can continue to
legally do those uh
those kinds of pranks
if there is a super tinted rock i'll
take it either way
i swear it's not a troll
america people need to know whether or
not their president is a troll
i am not a troll where oh it's so
it's so freaking sneaky man
yo that was huge it's incredible
look at that small rock a very useful
item
that now that's top tier backseating
stand up chad take a bow
chatty chatty wasn't there
it seems they do not care chad he was
it's austin powers
i'm sorry it's austin powers again yeah
oh
no i won't say thank you to chad it was
just one guy
got him
24-hour vip permanent
i'm i'm hopeful and this is like you
know like delusion
uh it's the first phase of grief
bargaining
now i'm like okay sac alter does not
work
with uh like removing the blood rights
here
or the whatever this item is called
however
maybe if i take the orbital and then i
use it
it will work and take
both you know
well we're gonna lose all of our hp
anyway i thought it was worth a shot
losing an orbital sucks but we can't use
the orbital aggressively anyway so
you might as well suck up book of belial
i don't really want to suck up anarchist
cookbook
it's a little too hot
we can at least use it for bookable isle
i have no idea what's going on but i'm
here for it that's what's going on right
there
at the start oh look would you look at
that at the start of every room
or every floor things get uh things get
nasty man
you do get a stat boost proportion of
the hp lost
that is that's you already know the vibe
yes sir i think this is one where you
just gotta accept
that like you know you're in it
until you get the perfect run some of
the challenges are like that
you know you can't expect to win an
isaac run you know
every single time especially if you've
built the habit of just jumping in and
pressing r
until you get a game-winning item it
doesn't work like that you know the game
can smell the desperation
sometimes you gotta you gotta put a
little elbow grease into it all right so
this is obviously incredible
um
we should suck them up but i'm i'm i
want to
if possible get um
bookworm first
we've touched one book before
spirit hearts kind of suck for us right
now so i think we actually touch book of
sin
oh we touched two oh cause we touch
anarchist cookbook
you're absolutely right and then suck
them all up
beautiful uh and i gotta tell ya we
might as well hold the pill
uh and take it
how you guys doing doing okay out there
it's a really really really great
uh void play i'm being completely
sincere
uh because of the fact that now we have
some invincibility
so if i think the way we should start to
think about this challenge is
like instead of using void to suck up
bad items
like we can use void uh to
keep us protected on a tough room
while we uh while we wait for more red
hearts
not to mention it also gives you book of
sin which could pay out with the heart
when you use it
how about that and yeah i'm not uh i'm
not that into the tinted rock play uh
right now because we already got small
rock
so i think the only i mean it charges
void which is not bad actually but
it's it's not as good as the average
tinted rock but
do you think invincibility will block
the uh
will block the the damage i really doubt
but i really doubt that'll work i should
say but
if it works then we're like i mean we
win i think
it does no way come on it's april fools
you're taking me for an april fool
anyway i don't think we're gonna have a
charge anyway but we'll see
it blocks but it doesn't give you the
buff
fair trade
all right lots of hp that we don't
really care for
speed upgrade nothing wrong with that
take these
so bloody lust is like a synergy but
life's not all about synergies man
i think i think we're much happier to
just have some extra
uh survivability
now this next part is going to make it
seem like i'm uh
i'm a coward but these these are the
right choices man
you got to be careful like who's who's
giving you this advice online
there's a void charge you know you might
think that the person giving you advice
is like an isaac pro
because their name is uh hello this is
the realest invicta and so viktor
spelled wrong
sometimes you you might be uh
they might be someone who's actually
only got like 600 hours in the game
and is thus not good
you want to take advice from somebody
you take advice from me now that being
said i should not have continued playing
the self-sacrifice room
i forgot we can protect ourselves now
right
mash the mash strategies work okay
next step is coast
take your foot off the gas and just
freaking chill out man
just chill out get some red hearts back
you know it should only take a few rooms
and then put on the put on the slow jazz
we don't need andrew wk anymore we don't
need our gym pump up songs
we just need uh a little shoddy
don't you know it's a smoothie
beats to lower your heart rate too
these guys are faster now don't turn
this way
i think this only goes to regular satan
so i'm i'm
i'm somewhat optimistic to be honest
with you i'm feeling pretty good right
now
no i know you don't get the stat bonus
but like
are you is are people under the
impression that this run is difficult
because
uh you don't have enough stats or are
you under the impression it's difficult
because every single floor
your hp is reduced to the point where
you die in a single hit
like i i'm
i'm somewhat optimistic it's a lot
easier for us to
you know find stats than it is to
never ever get hit but it's it's close
it's like 50
50. why not take the stat
increases on easy floors like the cavern
let me really riddle you this okay
if the floor is so easy why do you need
the step bonus
i'd rather have the safety than the stat
bonus if the floor is as easy as you've
suggested
uh and i i rest my case and i pass the i
pass the court onto the uh defendant
because the stat bonus will help you on
the harder floors the stab bonus
disappears on the next floor right
it's a it's a temporary bonus
it does it stays oh that's okay you got
a good point then
i mean you can still die in a hit on the
caverns after being like you know i'm
built different if it's permanent though
that's sick
all right i can see the value in that i
still
am not going to do it
[Laughter]
what the oh right because we have
satanic bible
okay i don't even know like how this
will work now so i'm trying to walk it
through
it's not permanent april fools so i'm
like
i think if i pick up abaddon
i'm only gonna get demon hearts
but then i don't if i use invincibility
i don't know man let's do it it'll be
funny
you can't get demon hearts because i'm
bethany all right
now you got me on that one
that was an unwise play
we need red hearts immediately
just give it a sec i don't think we're
toasted yet
you grab this and this
and never get hit
next floor because of he's a genius
hold on hold on hold on yeah yeah take
this
there's options wait a minute okay you
know what let's get insane
the battery in the shop is the battery
uh pack it gives you
like three little batteries okay now we
have epic fetus with some double drops
michael dublay um we might as well take
our stats now i think
well no i don't know now that i think
about it maybe that doesn't make sense
okay hold on
this would be the ultimate challenge if
we succeeded here we're we're
desperately uh searching for magic mush
and money to play this judgment because
if the judgment gives us hp
then we're laughing again just like we
were last time
go out on your own terms i'm gonna go
out on my own terms
freaking on on my shield or whatever
what is what does he say
uh with with your shield or on it where
i choose uh with it
i choose with it that's what we're gonna
do
just everyone just chill out for for two
freaking seconds
we're just thinking it through love the
isaac
jay i screwed myself i'm on this is the
bloody mary challenge
i took abaddon thinking like oh i'm
gonna be so
i'm the smartest man in the world then
it turns out i'm
freaking not the smartest man in the
world i'm actually an idiot because you
can't get the demon hearts from abaddon
but it did give us so many charges on
our our incredible void
dude hold on
we still got 13 charges so we can
definitely do this once more
we even got another red heart also
somehow oh that's monster man well
that's not that exciting
come on you you loser you nerd
you peace
i'm just just studying it i know we got
one more but just
okay i guess we'll be using it
hold on hold on we're not done yet i'm
not owned
an attempt was made if he could just hit
that awas over here then i could escape
without having to use it
i really didn't want to have to do this
but
just go hard on this one two of diamonds
son of a
okay going offline guys
okay we hold on we could buy a battery
charge for the next floor
i'd rather buy the battery pack if i can
i mean we're going down a half a red
heart anyway like i'm okay with that
please come on
oh god come on man come on
hanged man something's wrong
i'm gonna go looking for the second
secret room
demon judgments now only drop spiders if
you blow them up
that's good the streamers have had it
too good i in my opinion
constantly uh constantly winning runs
by uh by blowing up demon judgments
it's nice to see them put back in their
place
okay second secret room please doesn't
exist there's no second secret rooms on
this one
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait
wait
bottom left of the secret room okay
you're absolutely right
here we go
what do we got lots of pills this could
be big hp up
and we got a natural charge and we got a
little closer on that one
we're back we're back in the casino
that's fine whatever luck doesn't do
anything anyway right are you a wizard
classic i can see forever just in time
luck up
owns get owns okay that was a good one a
very solid room
very solid room for us there we'll we'll
take the shortcut back
i mean with with a battery charge we
obviously like have to come back this
way
and uh do this
we got the razor blade after all that
you had the audacity to give me the
razor blade
really makes you think we do have two of
diamonds
so we'll pop the head right away
awas i personally guarantee
like we could use it to skip a floor but
that's not how you play this game
you use it to get a crawl space and the
crawl space
gives you bff we are rolling now
we we just won probably just won the
game right there
now we have an orbital so how are they
gonna hit me if i have an orbital i
don't see it happening
we'll take this so we don't immediately
die
on the next floor hopefully and uh yeah
doubters i'm going to give the doubters
a chance to cover their short right here
you know if you if you want to pay back
uh 1.25 times your original bet now's
the time
you might as well hit me i'm not going
to stop you oh you don't even do me the
service
now we just wait as long as possible to
use
this book of sin
i mean we got to try to play the
judgment of the blood bank dude
with book of sin we gotta we gotta try
we we can wait till we get a little
further
ahead on this floor because now we're
actually looking semi-stable
like a like a cream cheese
i mean you're gonna laugh because this
is truly asinine
my personal prediction
if we make it to the boss we win this
run
the odds of us getting an item we need
are insanely high
all we need is hp
we have epic fetus we have the ability
to protect ourselves
every single floor
from the the negative effects of the
challenge
i think i think the abaddon play is
going to go down in history as one of
the smartest plays in isaac history
you also have satanic bible yeah but we
can't get demon hearts it it charges up
uh
it gives us a little uh a little refund
on our active charge
okay this is for all the marbles
this changes everything a double hit
please
don't even need it don't even need it
why not right okay i'm just trying to
think what the heck we even
suck it all up man you could suck it all
up
but before we do that
[Laughter]
probably got no keys you're absolutely
right
what this challenge is supposed to be
hard
[Laughter]
take the halo oh no i accidentally got
every stat
item ever invented twice
i don't even know what's happening man
i'm freaking
i'm i'm just going off now
we don't the funniest part of that is we
do not need stats
at all all we need is hp
so let's get it
this man makes no sense i
i couldn't agree more quite frankly
i couldn't agree more
but like um how do we lose now the only
way that i
foresee a reasonable
a reasonable loss happening here is uh
not having a battery charge when we go
down to the next floor we got enough
rooms left to charge it right now so
that's not a big deal
you see lust even stutter stepped for a
second
whatever who cares
lust was like i don't know if i want to
like bring this kind of
evil on to my life today and then they
decided well you know it's what i'm
programmed to do
i might even take the health down
just to feel something
well i i personally guarantee you will
never see this challenge done in this
exact fashion
he skipped the halo he's not going for
those coins excuse me
i didn't skip the halo alright i sucked
up five items
rather than taking the halo
there's a difference sweetie
okay we gotta play the blood bank that's
that's a given
we did get the prayer card out of that i
don't know what happened to the
to the eternal heart from the prayer
card but
gaming i almost sucked it up that's one
step too far
if i had if i'd sucked up the halo that
would have been too far but you know
what
i agree yeah this is just like that
scene in lucy where she turns into
computers
i am no builder thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
thank you much appreciated now just
don't forget you you hit the space bar
here
can't be stopped double your keys
what the well i'm very glad we didn't
like screw up not having a charge that
would have been
truly devastating we would have died
i gotta admit you're you're a hard enemy
to to crack here
uh bug report a little pin
cannot be killed with epic fetus
i'd like to submit a bug report
little pin is the most powerful
uh enemy in the game that is probably oh
son of a i'm gonna guess not working as
intended
uh they are immune to epic fetus
they can't be killed simply can't be
killed
it's not possible
oh my god uh red hearts let's go we we
die
we live i've been back to hell and back
and
back to hell i'm back to hell i'm back
mimics excuse me
since when
that's lying from dota yes yes sir
i'm going to be honest with you why
wouldn't we
like i think at this point we'd have to
be stupid not to
maybe it'll reroll the curse
nope oh and we still have epic
fetus
please don't make me fight
the
don't make me fight the the little pin
man i can't do it
help down i should have known i guess
next charge it works v4 doesn't work on
first charge
who made this
what were they thinking
saved well okay
confirmed it definitely does work
[Laughter]
okay okay now we're doing the challenge
for real
f i i can't disagree believers have been
real quiet since this video came out
but if that's what it takes to get
through little pin
then that's what it takes he should be
dead he he
he tried to dock in a section of the map
with no
uh with no terrain he should have
fall died to fall damage
hanged man okay now we're talking
why does he put so much sauce on it man
the hanged man
no don't you stay i'll go to you i'll go
to you you stay
um saved we gotta reroll this whole run
man
scary
[Laughter]
yeah yeah i knew i was going to lose the
books that's why i did it
sometimes you got to destroy the sacred
texts
because you know j.j abrams is just
going to write him back in anyway
you know i deserve that one
plus none of the books were um one up on
wall street by peter lynch so they're
probably just
not even worth the paper they're printed
on
got him got him got him please thank you
okay let's get one more charge
you know i would read one up on wall
street by david lynch that that would
it would be an interesting perspective
that's for sure
we should go to the shop first going to
the shop nl go to the shop
2021 challenge
i don't want to reroll just yet i'm not
i'm not ready for it
it's it's a little too risky for my
blood
first you gotta you gotta feel what it's
like to have no power
so that you know what to do when you
have power
i mean you gotta take the coupon
then you use it
then you
buy this so that it must make one of the
other two items get
free when we suck it up
it doesn't work on the first pass
whatever
still got don't care didn't ask plus we
still got a tears upgrade
but we could do it again
and then get one of these
dr fetus is that's a strong item
no question about that
i really wanted the compass but i'll
settle for this we also just got to nine
lives
which actually means the challenge might
be doable again
let's go
you know you don't even wanna know what
i was gonna say i was gonna say where
did
where did dr fetus go
it's quite simple just don't get hit go
to item room they
simply do not exist on these challenges
the item room does not exist uh
on the bloody mary challenge because
they're worried it's already like so
easy
that they don't want to give you item
rooms and have you just like steamroll
it obviously
i don't know what you're doing okay you
stand in the middle
sure okay like of course yes why
wouldn't i all right let's do it
apparently satanic bible was involved at
some point on this floor
um all right down to the next floor
i don't know what's happening uh you
know you know you're absolutely right i
should have gone for the health down
pills that were back there
i remember this item is something to do
with tears
when you're when you're right you're
right man having nine lives is insanely
good
but i did hear um through the grapevine
that um
you might lose your lives on a
transformation now
so we we got to be mighty cautious with
that
that's my bed
but what if we just used eight of them
instead right here and then re-rolled
genius yeah we could just go to the
self-sacrifice room use
nine lives and then my god
you also lose your transformations
okay good to know good to know
i am having some fun though i mean this
this is my kind of run you know
how would i describe my my isaac energy
in a nutshell um
this i want i was gonna bomb myself in
there anyway honestly just to get out
safely
uh i would describe my isaac energy
as making uh a mistake and then refusing
to acknowledge it as a mistake and just
like quintupling down
uh and and this run has really allowed
that to work in a big way
so i respect it
if you never sell you can't lose uh
pride exactly
exactly
pot play outstanding outstanding move
abaddon play probably is one of the
smartest moves i've ever made like if
you can't understand it
like to to the the lay mind the mind of
the lay person
genius and idiocy are indistinguishable
so
you know if anything i didn't realize
how many people i had to be sympathetic
to
yeah sure let's like let's suck this up
that makes sense all right
um yeah why not i don't know
let's grab this for a second and then
just do that
how we doing here we got an eternal
heart just chilling
we do have nod leaf now
we have missing though
oh we dude new spider mod just dropped
how about that
but we can't use missing though because
if we use missing no we lose
void which we don't want that's too much
i know we lost our lives again this was
the same i i don't want anyone to ever
be able to say
nl took the easy way out on this
challenge by having book of shadows
i want you to i want you to have to be
forced to recognize
that i did it my way
the man simply cannot be stopped
we we got an hp upgrade oh because we
rerolled our whole run into mom's knife
dude
little battery charges down there you
little sickos your
freaky little sexy sickos i'm excited
okay
that's not so good but that's fine roll
it again
i did say i don't want anybody to say i
didn't take the easy way out
missing no stayed i think i'm gonna kill
the boss and then re-roll um there's a
troll bomb
wait a minute can i see what greed's eye
i can see what's in the chest
man
or guppy's eye guppy's eye
how about that oh they're excited
mom me
i'm hoping our reroll here will re-roll
the missing no
but i can't say for certain if that's
the case
it did not well this should be
[Laughter]
interesting
it's simple we just live
that's tough that's tough this is an
impossible room
can't be can't be beaten
i'm not super thrilled to have uh
bbf just flying out there they're trying
to get me killed
we do still have the void you're not
wrong
i love this song
we are the world okay that scared me
what what if what a chat what if what if
just kidding i wouldn't but what dude
what if we popped hangman and went in
there
whoa
you know it had to happen at some point
let's start again that was fun though i
had a good time
the abaddon play
all right if you're just watching we're
on the bloody mary challenge
and we just lost but it was honestly
like one of the best
wins of my career i had i had a great
time
meanwhile ten thousand people sorry
thirteen thousand one hundred people
begging me to stop having fun and
instead just like
please just complete the challenge
so that you can unlock a penny that when
you pick it up gives you the curse of
darkness
and i looked them in the eyes and i said
no because you know what we're all about
having fun here we're all about the
vibes
and if i could do it again i'm going to
do it again man
hold on that run was slash marker
next bloody man



could we all i ask on this one is could
we at least
get the
confirmed dictionary definition
of uh whether or not it's possible to
get a permanent upgrade from the stats
we get here
from from whatever this awful item is
called the upside down t
is damn we call it because it's a right
side up t
it's not permanent stats are you telling
me that in the last episode somebody
lied
in we had them swear
on the lad bible and they still lied to
us
that's perjury 24-hour stats
permanent
how dare them that's what i'm saying man
that's what i'm saying okay so i'm just
trying to think about how we're gonna do
this
i like an orbital an orbital's good i
think a
sensible approach for us here is um
don't use our shubatabu plays until we
know
we're going to uh
have half a heart you know so like don't
use them here on this boss i can dodge
this boss i
24 hour stream of dodging this guy
actually no problem
no place to leverage those so we'll save
our shoops
for this floor because now we're going
to be on low hp
having these shoops is uh more
advantageous all right that's a nice
library
it's charges but you know what if we
could if we could get an item that
changes characters
the hero font would be more valuable as
spirit hearts if it worked that way
hmm so this is like it charges
itself that's not that good
um we did get bookworm
so there's something what if you what if
you blow this guy up man
yeah the clicker might actually be a
pretty solid item right now
though i hate to say it
it's true don't you know just find one
specific item
forehead but you know it's been known to
happen like remember last time we
we had the one com we had the run
completely one until
you know some idiot was like hey take
abaddon
it'll be funny
and if i ever figure out who that guy is
he's
okay you're fast now huh he's 24-hour
band permanent
is what i was gonna say
wasn't it you you better hope not
otherwise i'm out of here
um well we might as well go to the curse
room we lose permanent stats but
some permanent stance although they're
not permanent stats although their
permanent stance nobody knows yet
the jury's still out
ban yourself sit yourself 24 hours sit
ban yourself new new hob just dropped
okay let's see we had 6.28 on this floor
we lost stats when we went down to the
next floor and gained them again
so it's definitely not permanent okay
satanic bible will give us a deal with
the devil
telepathy for dummies necronomicon
i still like shoop the whoop here do we
want a deal with the devil instead of a
regular deal no
yes it's tough
it's a tough decision i think for one
floor yes
for one floor we want it but we're gonna
take shoop with us
good shoot good shoot we got 15 spirit
hearts
burning a hole in our pocket
earning natural charges dude honestly i
think this is easy
i don't know why everyone's so convinced
this is a hard challenge
i'm starting to believe it might be one
of the easiest challenges ever
added to the game well that's not true
because scat man was like
actually like okay ed cover your ears
scad man was so easy that it actually
almost put me to sleep um
but i don't think this is
as hard as as the normies would
have you believe let's put it that way
i can't get in there huh
you lost scat man yeah and you know
uh cleopatra died when she got bitten by
like a snake or whatever
as long as we're gonna keep talking
about things that are like you know in
ancient history
yeah that could have been bad um
yeah yeah yeah yeah
something something something and
there's something yeah
yeah yeah yeah you know this one's
sing-along if you know it
andy have you heard about this one
tell me are you lost in the pog
andy are you goofing on streamers hey
baby here's some gifted subs
two three four if you believe
i got nothing for the chorus but i do
like the part where he goes
yeah daddy yeah yeah that part is
is insanely good okay
i mean
i'm gonna be honest you take two of
those and call me in the morning
question mark it's my favorite item too
spooky for me
i have no idea what you are
i have the occult damage up and you can
control your tears
okay that song blows 24 hours
i'm sorry i'm losing it man
i'm losing it it is an endlessly great
quote though
you can use it for any purpose
any purpose related to mild anger at
least
you could count how many times you said
that this stream you can count anything
brother
24 hour man
permanent
just i don't know what it is it's such a
good quote
i'm so happy we had so many spirit
hearts that i can actually like live
this is a tough one still tough
this is one way to do it man
i don't want to use too many but like if
you're gonna use them now's the time
like
when when you're low on hp and then you
store them up when you're when you're
high on hp hopefully or high on podness
if you're mathis now i understand like i
watched dan's first
alt f4 stream and i was like where does
this man get the energy
now that i'm you know i've been playing
isaac for
all 13 of the last 13 hours i've
streamed i'm like it's uh
i totally get it it's just mania
sir so yeah breakfast street yo rucario
thank you thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
pog we're alive so
so eat with the delicious breakfast
treat
sanchez's okay sorry
what i meant to say we gotta elevate the
level of discourse here
you know everybody knows that general
custer died at the battle of
little bighorn what this book
presupposes is
maybe he didn't
i don't know how i feel about eye of a
cult here
i feel like if the shots didn't break uh
so quickly i'd be a lot happier
maybe we need piercing shots to to make
that happen
i mean like we could get a
we could get an absolutely amazing tears
upgrade
um
ah screw it hp's easy to come by
empty vessel's not the right play this
time though it's probably an eternal
heart in here
nine lives hey king you dropped this
thank you it's a crown for anybody not
looking it's a crown
goodbye i'm dead i'm alive
yeah empty vessel will kill us dead
there's no chance
unfortunately too spooky saved you i
don't
what is too spooky oh it scares enemies
who get close
okay well okay two spooky might have
saved me but i picked up two spooky so
who saved two
self save exactly i pulled myself up by
their bootstraps
your music saved me
i know i picked it up when when it was
um curse of the blind you know why
because i take a chance on him you take
a chance on me
we got curse of the blind pick up to
spooky
if you change your item we could get it
thank you
rat jam dude rainbow poop undefeated
no thank you no thank you okay 14 spirit
hearts in reserve
yeah abbott full stop does not get
enough respect
this run is now dedicated to abba
look at that as soon as we dedicated the
run to abba save the item
going down to the next floor still got
11's spirit hearts backing us up
i hate abba how can you hate abbott
oh frick i forgot about that how can you
hate abba man
overrated everybody in north america
freaking hates abba dude tell me you're
from sweden without telling me you're
from sweden
that's not true mamma mia was pretty
popular huh
no no
he lived
things got mighty dangerous there
yeah abba's sick man waterloo great song
winner takes it all
winner takes it all is such a good song
vince gilligan used it in better call
saul
mamma mia and dancing queen i don't you
know i don't vouch for those but
like the ones where they actually tried
to make a good song they often succeeded
you can't be hit simply cannot be hit
come off it man abba's awesome
why you why are you singing songs like
abba bro
oh sorry sorry
i don't know head over heels by abba i
only know the
the tears for fears one which is a heavy
pog energy for sure
as soon as ever
and talk about the weather get the tears
up in the theme and then we'll go in the
room
bgs are better than abba so like here's
the thing
they can co-exist but also
bg's also heavily underrated
everybody just because uh
you know staying alive is like so
unbelievably
popular at least was in the 70s like
they think that the bg's are like a one
note disco
uh you know like joke but first off
disco is kind of cool
you know people will be out here like
insulting disco but then be like oh
check out this new lcd sound system
album
yeah what do you think james murphy is
dude he's just sad disco
it's true and he should say it
but the bg's underrated like staying
alive i think it's a good song but like
you've
heard it a lot for sure um but
all the other songs off of the what the
heck is this
off of the saturday night fever
soundtrack are so good you know what
let's stop this problem in its tracks
the one where he goes i gotta shove it
up
and i should be dancing that's like
it's honestly that came out in like 2019
they would be like a hundred gaks they
would be beloved by the
by the populace
how deep is your love it's a great dude
wonderful song
how do they sing so well
i i don't it's it's not fair man because
i'm
living in a world of park
holding me down when they should
be pogging up yeah i don't know how they
do it like
you know what they just build them
different in australia i guess
love the gaks i don't even know where i
am on this run to be honest with you
i'm i'm inclined to believe that
actually i've come to terms with the
fact that this item
uh where we control our tears is
actually horrible
i think it's it's a negative i wish it
had not
shown up
insubordinate and churlish you know what
a card matters
it seems like it needs a bit more
practice i agree it seems like it could
go back to the practice room and
practice not being bad
uh so that it's worth having on this run
but shoop the whoop they broke the mold
when they built that one
that that item is killing it man no but
on the other hand okay hold on hold on
what do you got for me
the idea of taking a forget me now here
is actually hilarious
because it does get us out of the boss
room but it gets us
out of the boss room at the cost of
shupita whoop and it gives us nothing
like it gives us access to one more shop
and a mom
fight like it's a guaranteed badness
it's not good i wish it were but it's
it's literally
it's a throw with no entertainment value
i thought i could blow it up imagine the
pog though you don't use my own words
against me
i really need your pog
oh we came so close to the edge
okay i'm gonna get the half heart don't
sweat it
love it love it now we're talking
are you about to break you know what i
realized
i thought that in rock music linkin park
invented using record scratch in their
songs
and then i was listening to the lonesome
crowded west and i realized that modest
mouse did it back in 1997
on the on the song hart cook's brain i
feel like
uh my my whole life up to this point had
been a lie
they got a lot of parts in that song
they go like
it do that a lot it's it it's really
opened my eyes man
modest mouse might be the first new
metal band on the planet
modest mouse confirmed first they're
innovators
that's new metal baby
does rage against the machine count uh
yeah i forgot about them
that's a good point
they've been around for a while why am i
still taking these pills man
nobody knows and yet here i am
herbie hancock did uh scratching before
yeah but herbie hancock also loves to
lie
although i will say i do love
that herbie hancock song that goes dirty
yeah rocket that's what it's called
okay i'm almost out of
superfluous charges this is not good
i thought at some point the run would be
mathematically forced to scale
and that appears to be incorrect so i
think
i'm realizing we're probably dead
you mean throwing man we got no items
got probably got no games either this
excel it is okay we can live we just got
to play out of our minds
is i've been saving the pog energy
it's very simple next floor is shoal
which is the final floor
we're not in danger immediately on shoal
because of the fact that we have
the justice card we can use our justice
card
to give us some hp
please sir may i have a crumb of bets
curse room dare i no i shan't
on the other hand i must
there is zack snyder's justice card
this card might be 4x3 for all i know
what's your favorite part of any modest
mouse song
i like the modest mouse songs that sound
like isaac brock like phoned in the
lyrics from a pay phone
in eastern washington state
the ends lull good one
24 sorry permanent
he does say well a lot well
he might say that is that and these are
these i'll tell you what you get you get
away from me
or he might say cowboy dan was a major
player in the cowboys scene
he says that all the time
he does also say well it's the big show
how's that by the way is that is that
show good
the show where uh
big show is a dad
is it a good one i got here what's the
actual win rate
depends do you mean how many runs have
we won or how many times has
have you been a winner for being here
we've had some big wins today honestly
in both terms but also in game terms um
we've had some heavy heavy losses as
well though
some some little freak in chat got me to
pick up uh
abaddon as bethany ruined my whole
freaking run dude i persevered as best
as i could probably better than anybody
could have
ever anybody else on earth could have
done but
it wasn't enough
we win we win the game double win
why take pills because i need to find a
health upgrade man
close knowing full health exists is nice
i'm dumb saved saved
mr reckonator thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
thank you i cannot glance at chat but i
appreciate the support
use justice how about you
give me good advice instead of bad
advice because we need this justice card
for the next floor
and now what are your thoughts on the
hipster subculture of
the early 2010s it was very annoying as
a man with early onset male pattern
baldness and bad eyes
that um i ended up being lumped in
as a as a super hipster just because i
was
like shaved bald and had thick glasses
everybody was like nice hipster look and
i'm just like i'm just broken man like
jeans are just
[ __ ]
but i i do feel like um
the hipster it got easier for me
personally
when all the hipsters converted to um
having waxed mustaches
and man buns i think that made my life a
lot easier
nobody assumed that people just assumed
that i was bald for bald reasons you're
right i do have two justice cards thank
you
you were not wrong there
is wax stash still around
i think so there used to be a brewery i
would go to to get a growler phil
yo tell me you're from vancouver without
telling me you're from vancouver
yo ox can i get a uh
raspberry changeling 2-liter growler yes
sir
yeah give me some of that jerky too yes
sir
um and he always wore like a vest
and like one of those like news boy caps
and he had a waxed mustache
and i was like that's how i know i found
my place
the beer was was very good
and you already know the vibes
ah frick
let's do it man
mama it would be very nice
to not die here okay that hurts
but it had to be done better to
to do what needs to be done and live
then hold on to an item and die i mean
you just can't dodge mama gertie like
it's it's it's not dodgeable that hurts
he's a genius
well that's the item we've all been
waiting for
now we do have a charge
i don't want to use it yet if i can
avoid it
nine percent chance with the deal with
the devil
this would be mighty nice
yo new probability just dropped john
nash has been real
quiet since this nine percent chance
turned out to be nine lives in mom's
knife on the same deal with the devil
easy
sometimes you gotta focus
maybe we should fight uh uh
who's this enemy again i haven't seen
him in 10 years um
yeah can corn can of corn and i'll be
all right can a corn all right take me
down here
that's hush
oh i thought i could dodge it
this room is livable
don't glance there will be no glancing
tonight
we got a natural charge
i don't know what you do and i don't
want to find out
no
going offline guys
sorry



hey we're back playing some repentance
it's been going pretty well
we've actually done
admirably i would say we we've made it
further in
many more times than i would have
expected so early
you know it's still learning what the
enemies do do and all that but and and
readjusting the new shot speed but but
really doing a great job of uh
at least milling every single content
for
all the juice that they have including
the pulp
close to 50 50 in the polls that's how
you know
if you're watching on youtube you don't
know what's going on but there was a
poll about whether or not
we would win and we're stuck at 50 50.
this is a pretty hard game that that's a
higher than expected
percentage of believers
do you like pulping your orange juice um
here's the thing and you're gonna take
this as a bit of a flex
okay in fresh orange juice
i don't mind pulp in
like tropicana orange juice or like
orange juice
concentrate and stuff like that i don't
really like the juice to begin with
like and we've had this conversation
before and and people uh
they're very protective of their orange
juice
like fresh orange juice is like sweet
and also like a hundred dollars per
liter okay we just took that one right
in the face
nearsighted friend is better but not
that good still i'm gonna re-roll it um
yeah like fresh orange juice is like
sweet and delicious and then like all
the orange juice you can buy in the
supermarket
tastes like battery acid
look for another battery charge speaking
of which
like it has such a high degree of
divergence between
like excuse me like what
fresh juice tastes like and what
store-bought juice tastes like
it's not like i'm going out by the way
and buying fresh orange juice all the
time like
it's mighty expensive if i'm
like an orange julius or something like
that i might consider but
like the actual i i would go so far as
to say like
orange juice like the lobby for orange
juice
has really they've performed a psyop on
the rest of humanity
because it's simply not that good but
people have
have now come to the opinion that it's
like a health food or something and it's
you've absolutely got to have it for
breakfast otherwise i'm not going to get
enough vitamin c like i'm at such a high
risk of getting scurvy or something
okay ragman default stats not where we
want to be
what do you do you wait for him to
summon another head
that's fine i don't sweat that you wait
for him to summon the head
excuse me you heal off of that is that
new or it
is am i just bad um
someone head so i can place a bomb down
and look like a genius
thank you now we're talking
okay we have a key i don't even remember
what the heck a bar of soap does but
luckily it tells me
tell me your tears and shots speed up
with telling me your tears and shots
speed up
anyway i uh yeah i don't like orange
juice
at least store bought and if you're
buying
i love fresh orange juice we're going to
see if this is 48 hour energy
hematemesis could definitely be better
how about grapefruit juice i meant the
ice perhaps
somewhat surprisingly i'm a big fan of
grapefruit juice fresh is still better
but i think that goes for like just
about everything
um
just keep it moving here uh but i i like
a store-bought grapefruit juice from
time to time
i don't i don't have a a negative
connotation with some bitterness
and i enjoy bitter foods to some extent
no i'm not a savory juice guy i don't
like tomato juice either
matz clematto matz clematto's been real
quiet
since v8 splash came out
no i'm with you so somebody in chat just
said uh i may be considered a child but
apple juice with breakfast just hits
different
it's one of the like great weirdnesses
of like uh
standards that like if you like orange
juice you're an adult and if you like
apple juice you must be like six years
old
i'm like store-bought apple juice tastes
way better than store-bought orange
juice
to me at least
it's a good it's a good quencher i agree
yes i know i only drink tap water i mean
i i drink
i drink coffee for breakfast i like
literally like
97 of my beverage consumption is water
and then occasionally i'll have like a a
diet
soda if we got uh you know some takeout
or something like that
just keep it moving
what about bubbly yeah water
oh yeah my favorite alcoholic beverage
gin and chocolate milk
the way the the pine needles uh
really accentuate the the chocolateness
of the chocolate milk
okay well this is now doubters are
shaking
what go ahead take my battery charges
see if i care
no i'm a i'm like an ipa stout guy
they did i think tech x got a little
nerfed but it's still
like
still extremely good i will say though
like i don't know if anybody else here
lives in like
the west coast or maybe they've taken
over everywhere
it's starting to change like a couple of
years ago
basically like all you could get from
micro breweries were ipas
it's a little better now you can get
like
you know they're making a lot of sours
um
making a lot of like belgian wheat ales
and stuff like that but still like if
you go
to uh like a liquor store or a beer
store
here every brewery has like
nine ipas and even i'm like enough is
enough
you know like i get that that's what the
market's like here but
there's only like like five cool stouts
i i always enjoy like uh
uh storm black plague stout delicious
always enjoy a saint ambrose oatmeal
stout
but then like you know there's not that
many to go around man
at least up here
why am i i dodge and then i decide you
know what no i'd rather get hit
yeah man west coast is like in love with
ipas
a cbc journalist did like a a bracket
of the best beer in bc beers
best british columbia
uh i do like a speed upgrade
much more than i like a shot speed
upgrade but it is what it is
and uh the the
the beer that won the ipa bracket won
everything but it was also the beer that
i voted for
so what can i say
we need to save some bombs let's move on
this this run is a great chance here
no we don't get uh pliny the elder up
here or or plenty the young
younger for that matter you probably
could get it but it's like uh
you'd be paying import fees i don't even
know if you could get it now with covet
and everything but
lord palmerston they were they were bc
specific beers it's a beer called fat
tug
made by a uh a brewery on vancouver
island called driftwood
taking a lot of damage here
wait what it's humorous to you that it's
called fat tug
i couldn't possibly understand why
it is a great name like you wait
whenever
and this is uh wistful like pre-covered
days or like if you're
i guess vaccinated and loving life on
the patio right now rubbing it in for me
uh
please whatever it's still a good item
um i don't i don't take pleasure in this
for the record
but whenever they're like and what do
you have to drink i'm always like
can i get a 500 milliliter fat tug and i
always feel like i'm about to get
slapped in the face
and i i would deserve it quite frankly
that's yeah
can i please get 50 centiliters of fat
tug
can i get or you just point to it can i
get this beer
oh you want a big fat tug
it's in so many words man
okay now this is where you gotta use the
thinking you
stop stealing my charges dude i i mean
little
chub is not that good so
i think we re-roll and if we still see a
bad item we just take the random one
we have a beer here called buttcomb now
we're talking
i did see earlier today there there's a
a
famous english brewery called brewdog
it's they're not really a brewery so
much as like a corporation but
f they were like
scottish sorry scottish and they were
like
hey suggest some collaborations for
beers
no answer is like unappreciated and i
was like
you know what it you know be really cute
is if i snuck in there and said like
make a northern lion beer
and then there had already been like
a thousand influencers that had already
snuck into the dms and i was like oh
crap
too late
yogscast did it already oh man maybe
sips could get me in
hopefully it would at least uh
work better than the time he tried to
get into no pixels
[Laughter]
okay per throw is good per throw is good
we need to do news i'm dead i'm dying
i'm dead
i forgot literally like i forgot that
these guys could go
over the gaps in the ground
i thought i was a genius and and then i
realized i'm a fool but you know what
pay out the doubters
it's an incredible curse room it's still
good
i apologize to the believers things got
rough there
there's no story with no pixel like
literally i was like
sips got dan in and then i watched dan
play and i was like oh i need to get a
slice of this
so i said hey sips like i feel weird
asking because i know you already just
like leaned on your contact
to get dan in but could you get me in as
well and he's like yeah sure just add
this guy on discord
and it still is still pending
uh like six weeks later
[Laughter]
but even dan's not playing no pixel
anymore like i kind of
i mean i don't follow the streamer
trends that much but i do feel like
maybe
the i i miss the when the iron was hot
on no pixel and and maybe i'll just try
to get in
you know it's it's like cryptocurrency
you know i'll try to get in when things
are at a low
and then maybe like three years later
it'll come back and then i'll already be
in
yeah like chess exactly
how long do you think oh well first off
evp tom
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
how long do you think the the among us
legs would last
honestly i wouldn't even prognosticate
like
i sometimes i kiss a little bit on like
apollo stream or hafu
stream and i'm like among us viewers are
just built different
like the it's sisyphysian and they they
love it
so i mean a lot of kindred spirits maybe
with like isaac viewers right like
the game is the same just about every
time with like little variations and
then
they're they're like please feed me more
like one more please
kaidama yo thank you again evp
tom
plebs have been real quiet since evp tom
came out
okay hold on i gotta think about this
for a second
i it's on it and this is not like a
negative thing i know i make fun of
among us but like you know it's just a
different vibe
i just i find it like stressful to watch
i think it's the
the way that i now understand like
people who say that
uh the office is like oh i can't watch
it it makes me uncomfortable
it just makes me so angry watching it
i i i get stressed out man and i know
it's like kayfabe don't get me wrong but
i'm like it's just
again not being rude i'm not saying that
the streamers are
are this but i just find it an
unpleasant viewing experience because
they just
feel like bad
as i'm watching it i'm just like stop
shouting
can we calmly discuss the sus and and
non-suss levels here
can't we like adults just decide whether
the hard clear got sussed or unsussed
did he move into electrical i don't know
but with everybody
shouting i it's it's hard for me to use
my the logical centers of my brain
we need a key oh easy enough
we re-roll we re-roll this luck's good
maybe even luck is like more valuable
now
um i feel nutty
sorry phrasing
no i'm like i cuz now like some people
in chat are like yelling equals fun by
the way i'm like six years old and i'm
like oh come on man
it's not really the energy i was trying
to bring here is more like
uh
you know it's just uh it's not the
content for me i don't mind like mimi
conte i mean just in general here's the
thing you know i've talked about like a
couple of different
like uh spectrums on which i like
evaluate whether
content is right for me the more
streamers that are on the same stream
generally the more my enjoyment goes
down
i'm like a one to three streamer kind of
stream
guy at least now you know when i when
there's like a mega stream with like 10
people
i'm like often times i'm going to watch
uh somebody play like a little rainbow
six siege or something
if you gotta and i think that this is
where the among us lobbies have done a
great job
if you got streamers that are all in on
it they all got a great vibe and they
understand that like they can't be the
only ones talking
you got to give other people a chance to
talk then i think it can totally work
but all it takes is a couple of people
being like nah you don't get to say your
joke even though you haven't said a joke
for
20 minutes i get to say my joke and by
the way my joke is that's what she said
and then that's where i'm like sorry
guys i've got to go
um and leave here but
more power to you
okay i'm not sure about this almond milk
right now
what about oat milk yeah if they really
wanted to modernize the game they should
have replaced the almond milk with oat
milk
you hear this one
you hear this one kevin
now i understand what it's like to be an
only child that's true i was always
listened to
i can't deny that and i think it created
uh
unrealistic expectations for adulthood
i think there's some people that like if
they're not
you know it they're okay with having the
fight to get a word in edgewise
i'm very much the opposite like if i
have to fight to get a word in edgewise
i'm like screw you guys i'm gonna take
this gold and i'm gonna use it only for
my own
edification you know
you you had your chance to be in on the
jokes and we could have glorified each
other through them
now i'm using it uh exclusively for my
own benefit
and then i make a farting sound of the
mic
hold on bad
still pretty bad downpour one we might
as well just
use it because we got to keep the d6
rolling forward
okay we don't have a key this is a
rip-off man
i'll walk on some spikes if i have to i
don't have to i'm a genius
if you'll excuse me almonds
oats oats and almonds please i knew we
could sneak it in there it's just a
matter of time i must say your dodging
is the best it's been for years
like you gotta be so freaking
yolked just to have any chance to
survive in the current iteration of this
game
i love it oh we didn't get any bonus
bombs though
thanks for the gas up by the way i
appreciate it you always keep the curse
room in that situation
it's gonna fill you up and never let you
down
okay we we desperately need a tear
effect that's the next step
everything else is going pretty well now
like we we gotta
we got a pretty good setup for uh hp in
particular
but okay okay
that was damage i'll take it
no i i haven't had a chance actually to
watch mouth play uh at all
he's a little bit of an early boy by my
standards i'm usually still on baby duty
by the time uh
when he goes live it's
tears up do we really need a tears up at
this point this is an interesting
thought
because we're shooting 14 tiers a second
so don't get me wrong it's always nice
to have more but i
with a reroll machine i'm always like or
i'm almost i should say like maybe we
could just try to
try to mill something really good yeah
the knockback would be horrible
you're not wrong you know what
don't even think about it don't let chat
talk you out of it
all right we're gonna die this is
horrendous this is truly horrible
[Laughter]
but we did get a lot of consumables and
our damage got a lot better
okay but then remember all stats give
you
all stats
when the zane goes too far whatever we
can just get a reroll machine anyway
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no no
okay we got a mirrored dimension
we need to reroll that again as well
as long as we fight incredibly weak
enemies for the rest of the game and
they never get harder we got nothing to
worry about
come on man really really
i'm a little upset i got hit i i don't
think you know we we got to hold
ourselves to a higher standard than
getting hit against this guy
it would be nice if the lighting sorry
okay i'm getting too salty because what
i was going to say is it would be nice
if the lighting allowed you to see the
corners of the room
but
[Laughter]
what i meant is with all of my power
i accidentally made a mistake and
couldn't see that the corner of the room
was
uh not walkable
it was a little close for comfort this
is an old-school isaac boss though
literally like just walk around in a
circle it's like playing dark souls
it'll get you there
this tears up which is an all stats up
okay starting to get there
i don't know what we're gonna do though
um
yeah i don't know what we're gonna do
i'm trying to think about
what we got back here we got bob's brain
bob's brain is too spicy
man
i like it in general but i don't i don't
think it's right for us on this run
i think we're gonna go to the mirror
realm first maybe when we come back from
the mirror realm we'll feel differently
about
uh bob's brain
i have to remind myself that you you
gotta be and i apologize because this is
a little bit um rude to chat
but i gotta remind myself that most of
the time
chat gets a run that's like this they
just
hold r so i can't exclusively take their
advice
i have to remind myself instead that
um
i am one of the only fools on planet
earth that that sticks these out
and as a result i should trust my own
instinct
and honestly my own instinct for the
time being
says that this run is not that bad
i know it looks bad and and it certainly
has some negatives
i think libra was a definite negative in
the short term
but i do feel like it presents some
interesting long-term potential
now trying to remember the boss
it's literally the boss where all you
have to do is
walk in circles so put your money where
your mouth is
don't get hit get a new item the item it
doesn't matter what it is as long as it
stats
and then we're good
okay you just walk around in a circle
you got 12 bombs you could place down at
your leisure as well
good good worth it
not worth it but that's okay don't
complicate things everything's going
well here
you keep shooting because i don't even
know what the shots do like
they miss and they hit you you aim at
the enemy they miss you aim to miss they
hit
hp we re-roll believe it or not although
no
we take the hp and then we reroll bob's
brain instead okay
now we're talking
i've been a believer this whole time
heavy doubt energy
okay so it's still horrible like that's
not very good but
i'm proud of ourselves
we can at least look for second secret
room
i don't know this i've never seen a run
where both doubters and
believers are so uh confident they're
gonna lose
close close
nobody has any confidence right now
everybody is like i'm i'm out
i don't know i mean this could this is a
loss right now but uh
things change you know tough times never
last only tough people asked
et cetera et cetera
we take those we don't mind taking those
yeah i am getting used to the fact or
i'm struggling to get used to the fact
that when you play three and a half
hours of isaac on stream
that's like four runs
it's it's anti-nl technology
that's very good to know
keep it oh come on man i
the shots edmund the shots don't work
edmund
edmond the shots do not work they're
broken
it's too big for you i need to watch
that video before we reference it again
it's the video where the lady gets very
mad
mad at the guy in the hummer for parking
correctly even though she's parked
horribly
you know that one
please i just want the shots to go
straight occasionally
i hate watching those videos i don't
know that video is pretty sick
is this creep please come over here it's
creep
okay we have another damage source
saved oh do it okay okay so the shovel
we're gonna blow it up we're gonna pick
it up
we're gonna use it
we're gonna re-roll it what the heck is
that
it's all the foods mashed together binge
eater all you can eat
i have no idea oh
tractor beam tractor beam would go a
long way
i love like public freakout videos man
vancouver
i i think i talked about it yesterday
but it's a bit of a fever dream for me
i see okay i see what's happening here
vancouver shows up in in public freakout
like every day now
people throwing bikes through each
other's windows
it's kind of sick live in a very
entertaining city
the nightlife is you know not all it's
cracked up to be but the
the ambient culture is is very high
yeah any item pedestal could become hp
up i think for the time being that's
actually a pretty like
amazing get
but that being said i need to turn it
into
something different because we
desperately need stats okay that's
pretty sick
shops turning into it as well hey
i was thinking you jerk
shops doing this as well very nice
what's causing wacky broken tears
um it's this item called almond milk
that i think may just be bad as a joke
and i think the joke is on me
come on i i can't i can't lose my deal
with the devil because i need
uh to get my deal with the devil instead
don't leave yet don't okay you're fine
um
what the heck was that because we need
all stats
what are your stats doing i think i
think they're changing with
with almond milk i don't know maybe
let's be honest i don't have a great
grasp on the mechanics of the best at
times
maybe something with binge eater maybe
the more you eat the more your stats how
about that
makes you think oh taking hp ups gives
you a
massive temporary damage bonus and then
libra is spreading it out
this it's crazy like i think this run
might have the chance to win
now especially now that i know that
these buttons actually work
just trying to think we still have
batteries back there
this is a this is a re-roll
those are genuinely not good
i think we should do this wait wait hold
on
what do we need to leave this floor
nothing this this floor is fine we need
to give hp to leave the next floor which
doesn't seem like a problem
correct correct let's go
all stats baby
but they're decaying for some reason i
guess whenever did i did i get hp
instead no that
i picked up dinner instead oh my god
oh my god dude
how many memes is enough edmund
the next step all we need to do is make
it so when you pick up dinner it's
actually a 50
chance to not give you hp okay that's
too far i apologize it's just it's just
the salt talking but this is a
it's a little much you know
get the batteries
yeah we lost um we lost
access to the tears and shot speed up
which would have been pretty sick
but you know we'll keep it going and
we're still alive and
honestly we're gonna be pretty hard to
kill
i have no idea is that the knockout
shots
it is okay they're not stats but they
make funny noises so that's good enough
for me
it's not a big boss room i i am
having fun but i'm also i'm having fun
because i
enjoy being hurt digitally speaking
the zayn does not it doesn't bother me i
was born in it molded by it etc
etc some kind of digital masochist i
think that's a good way to describe it
yes
saved uh i we're never gonna hit with
any of these knockout punches man
like i'm slowly coming to terms with it
it will never happen
they just immediately fly into the
into the wall i'll i'll use my last bomb
saved absolutely incredible we needed
that deal with the devil we're not
taking hp we're taking the range because
we want all stats
okay there's something no no
ladies and gentlemen we got it okay
that's that's a huge
improvement it still kinda sucks
but that's a big improvement
[Laughter]
does it have normal shots it does oh my
god okay so we can almost just
play as if we're incubus now
so right now for those asking uh in chat
we are presently just trying to get on
locks like we're just grinding on locks
this is
we're trying to do isaac hard mode um
alt path right now so we got a ways to
go
we got uh i got some confidence
that's tough it's still very tricky and
if you just joined us this run really is
like
it's a bit of a wild one we have almond
milk which is uh like
bro really
i just want to hang out with this
judgment almond milk makes our tears all
funky
we also have a libra
which makes every item we get be all
funky
and then also all of our items become uh
hp upgrades if we don't pick them up at
the right time or they just sometimes
start his hp
upgrades get it i
hate you
i'm mad okay let's win the run i'm i'm
upset so we're gonna win the run
that's i'm actually mad at the game now
it doesn't happen too often
this is too much you
you've done you gotta done it now
you cheesed off the zane lord
i didn't think it was possible i've
maintained my cool for
for too long it's time to let the demon
within uh
escape and i don't know if i can put the
genie back in the bottle
we want technology i think that oh come
on
man you're a
purveyor of misery we definitely want
technology here i don't know if it's
gonna completely screw up our shots but
we gotta try
that seems awesome okay that that seems
like exactly what we're looking for
the ability to actually have our tears
go kind of where we want them to go
next step will be uh hopefully getting
some kind of
amazing tear effect or just getting so
many stat upgrades our damage is
uh hits the next level
vert pheromones
that's not so bad okay go ahead break it
open break it open
go ahead i'm not scared this bone heart
is not long for this world but i i
don't mind
good hit
saved
my god he's actually doing it infinite
range technology
that was so much easier than it had any
right to be okay we absolutely do wants
meet it's
hp plus all stats upgrade
hold on there you go i'll beat you your
own game
you son of a gun
now we don't lose the knife piece plus
.16 damage pog
yeah but don't forget about the fact
that we also got plus .16 tiers
now we got a lot left to do on this
floor we got to get the second knife
piece
um hopefully be able to go to the shop
i'm pessimistic but yeah whatever there
goes my boneheart
golden key would go a long way no doubt
about that
hey i just got here how's the stream
been macros you even gotta ask
come on man it was actually it was
pretty good
we played some good isaac um
knockout city a lot of fun as always
we although we did go up against the the
wayne gretzky of knockout city
trying to think do we have reroll
potential right now i don't know
now we're talking a key
i will go to the the curse room i mean
this is
this is beautiful is what i was gonna
say uh guppy items please
i don't mind walking diagonally i mean
we it's not like we have a shortage of
hp
you know oh that hurts completely uh
made up for the fact that we just got
meat
oh well um let's go back to
the shop dude trying to do this with
no knowledge of what the the map is
i'm realizing now like i don't think i'm
going to be done this run in 25 minutes
that's
that which is asinine
i think we started it with like an hour
and a half to spare
how dare you honestly at least it's a
static stat
repentance it uh it sucks up your time
no doubt
okay you know what okay here we go we're
going in first
i do want um i want to go to the shop we
got a re-roll i'm stoked for that
we got normal tears temporarily that's
pretty sick
we got a little crash bandicoot sequence
i really like this like actually this is
like a totally
welcome change for me
it's almost like a different game like a
a platforming section
i guess it's you know not really
platforming but you get the idea
like i think they did a great inversion
of the formula with this right here
plus like the i mean i'm gonna see it a
thousand times and you know inevitably
possibly get sick of it but
nice try the first time you see this and
you're just like what's happening
they get some tricks up their sleeves
plus like it's so easy that like
well i mean i deserve that
at the same time i did felt kind of
stuck there
let me in please
probably could have just done that from
the get-go the dodging is largely
trivial
it's just uh you know sometimes you get
stuck
good walking bad walking
good walking getting hit twice at that
that now that's embarrassing
do you get it really like a permanent
stat upgrade just for doing it though
no oh it's just you returning to your
stats from earlier
that's right okay where the heck
is the shop
just want to go to the shop man
it doesn't doesn't change anything it
just left him down okay thank you left
and down
and left and down
and and then down and then
yeah yeah there we go
have you have your have your jokes have
your laughs right now
it's by the time i'm done with this game
it's gonna be dismantled
i will take it
i don't mind keep it moving
i don't mind that's okay
in 2030 i can wait
trust me that's not a problem
okay now take me to the mausoleum i'm
just a notch in your bedpost and you're
just a line in a song
here we go that's good stuff
i oh you gotta hit the buttons first of
course you gotta hit the buttons first
keys please i'll take it i'm trying to
remember now all we have to do is beat
mom all
the funky stuff is like is done now
right
all we gotta do is play isaac now if if
i'm allowed to
funky kong now we're talking i gotta
tell you
okay first off i will take uh the
trinket but
i gotta tell ya i do you think that a
blood bag would go a long way
funny monkey
look at the monkey smile
hp please
i do i i don't even want to talk about
the fact that uh
you can't play two blood banks
simultaneously i i feel personally
attacked it was all fun and games before
now now i feel personally attacked
okay never get on the cardinal
directions with these guys
he's learning how do smelly hearts
work when they break they create
an aura of uh aroma
enemies take six percent
psychic damage per second
sure
until they tell you to use deodorant
good punch good punch okay heavy
synergies please
i i'm begging you for something
something inspirational
you know what it's a it's a re-roll if
at first
i will at least check it
so re-roll and then it's it's you take
the hp
you keep taking the hp they keep
offering
it i'll keep taking it
also can i point out to you that yet
again i have no
knowledge of the map
should never have gone over there that
one's on me
i would just like to know where i'm
going
really if if for no other reason than
like being able to
backtrack oh my god here we go again
yeah yeah okay i'm very familiar with
that room that's a good one
and just make sure you don't walk uh
that way 17 times when you're trying to
backtrack
what if the enemies can step on the
teleporters that would be funny
i mean like of all the curses
this is the one that sammy sends me
through the freaking
roof man which is how i know that they
got me
and they got me good
please pick up this rock not that one
not that one if possible
thank you thank you saved
saved i was saved i was in the pool
the knockback is okay okay
time to reconvene get get your brain
set right okay pop a temperance card
blow it up
pick up some hp turn everything into
bombs
you wouldn't you wouldn't not in this
present state
yeah knockout drops is not doing uh
it's not doing what i hoped it would do
ace cards kill enemies now
now we're talking
we've never gone this way hey this is
just
it's madness right like
i i can't be the only one like i feel
have you ever seen network
i haven't but i feel like the guy from
the wikipedia description
like i'm mad as heck and i'm not gonna
take it anymore
we have to take rubber cement
okay i i think it might end up doing
double damage because the shots will
bounce off the wall and then hit
hit enemies but
bro every floor is 25 minutes long
because i gotta backtrack seven times i
don't even know where i am man
please i just i i beg for a
a wafer thin crumb of mercy
oh yeah thank you thank you get score
off the screen
amazing okay there you go that dude the
damage output is actually genuine now
thank you that's very nice of you
i could go to the curse room uh now i am
completely screwed i thought this was
the only way to get to the boss
i thought this was a 100 guarantee
[Laughter]
relax three question marks okay as long
as we're holding bad trip like we're in
a good spot
right down left okay
if we could get like a homing tears we'd
be in a good spot too
left hand i don't know i like i kind of
like having um
i like having child's heart i think here
for hp purposes
like the isaac meta is
is turned on its head
i really think hp is the most important
thing now
it's down there come on don't bait me
it is down here okay that i'll take
ownership for that
that's unbecoming of of a classic gamer
such as myself
who grew up on all of the contras
yeah we were already in the item room
that's where we got uh
rubber cement you're gonna take my
incubus
no no what the you took my knife
give it back give it back please
okay just land shots oh my god the only
safe place
to stand was impacted by a knife
that's fine this is this is why we stack
hp this is why we stack up the hp
okay there's a very simple choice you
take magic scab
that was only mausoleum one my my word
bomb the skull okay sure you got a
forgotten lullaby look at that
sing for your friends
i don't know what it is i hate to do
this but i'm sticking with the uh
with the child's heart for now
just because i really believe that the
red heart meta is the way to go
sqweep
okay i know what i must do
this is for all the times they said
boomer reflexes
you break this come on down come on over
how do i
oh i know i know what to do okay yeah
yeah squeeze
squeeb squeeze
i'll take that what a puzzle room
give us your familiars improved rate of
fire
don't stand on the cardinal directions
that's pretty good
you know i can see definitely a play
where like incubus is how you send that
one
or the you know it's the right way to
play with incubus i should say
i i don't even want to mention the fact
that obviously we got curse of the lost
uh yet again um that's just the
prerequisite at this point
at this point i would rather like what's
the point in buying the map or the
compass you might as well just remove
them from the game
they have no purpose anymore unless you
have black candle as well
it's a little much
but i guess i should consider myself
lucky that i can
at least see the enemies
we call that mercy
i'm really not i shouldn't salt up so
much it's just like this
the the same curse over and over is
getting a little
just getting a little tedious
that's the thing it's like i'm not i
wouldn't say i'm upset it's like
it's a bit much that's it it's it's a
bit much
like i'm not no you mad l no i'm not mad
lel but it is like a bit much
i think we try to take this one and we
just
guess that when the other item is up
it's probably also non-hp on the other
pedestal
ghost baby all right that's uh you can't
win them all
we say thank you for the opportunity on
that one
probably would have rather had slipped
rib but it is what it is
troll bomb that's a new one
do you have something that's causing you
to get more curses
um i do
you're gonna make me say it it's called
the dlc
okay hold up you give me a pedestal it
might swap
another judgment i don't mind actually i
don't mind we we got there's there's
plays to be made here
i i wish i hadn't popped them right next
to the door though
i mean at this point we might as well
just stand still
all right hp or hp and we're stuck and
we have to take it immediately
i'll take hp
at least he didn't give me something
useless like the map you know
hp or the nail so the nail is
not as good as in fact it's almost
useless unfortunately um
so i think we take the hp believe it or
not
we can't even fit the
we can't even fit the nail we could use
it for a damage bonus but
that's true i suppose we could have
taken it and then used uh a re-roll
pedestal on it later
it's a valid point
i'm i'm still optimistic though as
insane as it sounds like our damage is
kind of taking us there
um you know i think we kind of do like
the key we like it well enough at least
flying is is very much appreciated
now we're talking oh yeah hold on i got
it
yeah no like magician's good i got to go
back for a bad trip though bad trip is
like
a gimme okay i'll play you as well
because as long as we have bad trip this
is
this is okay this is how it goes man
this is the cycle of isaac for an hour
people have been like this runs horrible
all of a sudden after putting in this
much emotional labor people are like
it's impossible to lose
there's no doubt at all carried
[Laughter]
so what happens when you don't hold r
though you hold r you lose a lot of
you lose a lot of runs like this you're
missing out
you are also missing out on some misery
for sure
okay we'll take gimpy gimpy's actually
pretty huge because it can drop us a
bunch of uh
it drops a ton of red hearts
might as well just take it we don't need
keys for the next section so let's go
for it yeah yeah yeah
no it's heavily not useless it doesn't
give you the spirit hearts but it
increases the drop rate of uh
of red hearts
nope i know you stomped three times but
i forgot about that part okay we still
got a 36 percent
devil deal chance
lord knows i got hp to spare okay we got
a one percent devil deal chance
so here's a question for you
do we need the polaroid to fight the the
real final boss
no right
negative is a damage up now really
okay
look at that look at that
i was thinking about using a re-roll to
try to you know mill some
useful items out of there but damage up
is is useful
so no harm no foul
it's just just kill the boss please i
don't know what's happening
i'll just continue to stand still and uh
all right
i would say at this point the number one
thing preserving this run
is please don't i have a map oh my god
the number one thing preserving this run
is bad trip
if we can hold on to this bad trip pill
which is admittedly kind of tough if we
can hold on to this bad trip pill we're
going to be in a good spot
and obviously like the more hp we have
when we enter the boss fight even if we
have bad trip the better
i'm just i'm freaking zonked out of my
mind that i have a
i have a map dude
this is crazy talk
gets smacked
it happens i don't understand this is a
great run
you know you weren't here okay when i
was down in the trenches
you weren't here okay just for the love
of god do not screw this one up
you take brimstone that's a gimme
all right um
look i don't need to tell you what this
looks like
[Laughter]
can i just say it super sucker come
jetting machine
all right fine and we'll take that we'll
take the all stats
and then what the heck it's hp dude
okay this is this is tough just give it
a sec squeeze
the other one's not rotating okay
squeeze and then we we do the dub
re-rolls
i see hp books hp books
let's get some dude dude do it
let's get some more battery charges
the library play hp is good for the
record we could always take more hp
i'm gonna go back for bookworm bookworm
i'm just gonna wait for a charge just
gonna wait for a charge
i mean like look at this this is
it's very strong
i choose to leave this room
and never return
he's done it pro gaming
dude mom's key actually ended up being
like the most insane pickup on this run
is nl okay oh no that it's it's
happening already i thought it would
take a little longer
the jealousy is already starting to set
in
from the people who gave into their ego
and started playing on normal mode
because they thought hard mode was
unbeatable
and they're starting to knock on the
door is he okay
this is the run of the century and you
only get it
if you don't hold our how about that
there's a lesson in there somewhere oh
son of a
dog
no shame in playing on normal there's no
shame in playing on normal
just as long as you're not also uh in
chat typing
what is he doing or or saying ridiculous
stuff
like gimpy only gives you spirit hearts
like come on man
i guess i gotta go in all right
i forgot i forgot about the contra boss
you guys are lucky mouth didn't get this
synergy like he would never
it would be the lootest stream in twitch
history
a range up is not that bad it's on all
stats we've already seen everything in
here
i think we take the range up so we can
use our rerolls on the library
plus we got the mom transformation don't
care didn't ask plus your mom dunk
okay don't don't screw this part up
that was actually pretty close i'm sure
the homing would be sick but but i'm in
heavy reroll hours now
we got more books okay i've decided i no
longer care
and i'm heading down to the next floor
there's so many great jokes you could
i'm just stealing them from chat
just give me one sec to make this one
work tactical
uh what sprite tastes like
what mcdonald's sprite tastes like
next floor
what are you talking about i think his
brain is melting after so much
isaac we have full hp
i feel like i'm losing my i'm telling
you it's like i said earlier
face me in the moisty mire i just want
to talk
like i honestly everybody in chat that
they think they're so cool and hip and
good at isaac
i personally guarantee i could lift all
of you over my head easily
without my heart rate even crossing the
triple digits
probably many people enchant i could do
two at the same time
without a doubt
i'm 200 pounds i know what i said
and i stand by it
how is that a flex i'm saying when you
were still pp in your pampers i was
beating many challenges more difficult
than you
oh my god you are a biggest loser i've
ever seen
liars get out truth will always prevail
oh just you know just a second full
health
we could use this for mapping tough
times never last only tough people last
yes it's true malf did put me in a
chokehold
but i i must again reiterate okay this
we should be fine but before we do this
like this is your last chance so don't
be stupid about it
play the judgment
mouth put me in a chokehold but
it was a sucker punch even he admits it
by the way
i was i was down on my hands and knees
cleaning in advance of a party that we
were having
dude we got stats up temporarily
uh and and he jumped on my back
and he admitted he did it in a moment of
weakness because it was the only way he
could get the jump on me
and that's all you need to know
so i i know how this is gonna sound i
still don't think this is like an
automatic victory i i would give us like
a 90
chance of winning for sure but i also
like some of these shots i don't know
how to dodge
and he does have a billion hp
i do like the audio cue like even if
he's off screen you know you're hitting
them
when you hear took
if you if you're not hearing that it's
time to adjust your your vision
oh he's dead okay never mind it was
actually insanely easy
[Laughter]
i honestly thought he had like 10 times
more hp than that
meet cleaver has appeared in the
basement all right



i i think that we are gonna do
uh bethany greed
like we gotta we gotta do something i
don't wanna say to like kill the time
but like we we gotta unlock a couple of
things on the
on the post-it note we got 30 minutes
until knockout city
might as well try doing some uh some
greed with bethany
i have no memory of how this works at
all
but we're gonna do it anyway so you
definitely yeah yeah hold on you shoot
these first
mind if i play greed
yeah wait do we not
pick oh you know you don't step on the
button that's the ticket
oh no he dabs oh
luffy one piece never dabs
i'm going back to crunchyroll
that's about all i know about anime
there's a long running series called the
one piece
i forget the name of the main character
but it's luffy something
and they wear a a floppy hat
monkey d luffy of course i think it has
something to do with like pirates
they're pirates or something on an
airship is that correct
yep they're pirates i told you man
i know all there is to know about anime
ask me anything uh pikachu
got it i'm gonna be honest with you
i should have stepped on the button
should have stepped on the button
earlier it's a regular ship but it can
jump
naturally who's the strongest anime
character
goku next question
not wrong
goku is so strong he willingly lets
himself die on multiple occasions
throughout
the dragon ball saga
just to feel something like just to make
it interesting for the audience
he's like sure guess i'll die
goku loses to his wife that's because
he's also the smartest character
in uh in anime
cute idea except
oh no i forgot if you take too long you
get two bosses oh yes i forgot the other
boss is monstro
how is that a boomer i hate my wife joke
i i'm starting to think that chad are
the real ages
it doesn't even make any sense
it's a very it's an insubordinate and
shirlish take 24-hour ban
permanent let's make it a zoomer joke
um the strongest character in anime karl
marx probably
bernie sanders chon
there you go got him
freaking own dude but the honest answer
is still goku to be honest
yes sir dude three cent keys now we're
talking
that's actually i think this is pretty
good as long as the
not many enemies fly i think this is
fine
well be that as it may
wait a minute you do this you get a deal
with the devil i remember i remember
but we can't get spirit hearts so we got
to be careful what we're looking for is
an active item
a one-room charge active item
would actually take us into the
stratosphere of bethany right now
i i know something's twisted up in my
brain
because i actually
100 believe
that jacob and esau are better than
uh bethany so the fact that i
think that has me knowing that i'm i'm
broken on a human level
so we need to figure out what's going on
with bethany in order to actually get
her to that next level
it's an angel room that's actually a
pretty sick
angel item although we will be hit quite
frequently
i don't know if bethany's bad but i
think she's a character for whom
the the item is very much uh like her
her quality is dependent on the the
space bar item she gets
knockout drops those are high knock-back
tiers maybe
i i respect the hp love the hp
um well we have full hp right now
you know what i'm going to throw that
away immediately get something like that
going on
now we start the synergies
in general i prefer not to buy
when we have curse of the unknown
oh that's not crawl space baited not
cursed the unknown curse of the blind
oh i forgot the fist tears it makes a
cool sound too
okay there you go we got wisps keep
crown alike going
yeah money's too pretty this isn't
greedier but still money's too precious
to just be throwing it away
on on random question marks we'll save
for the next floor when we actually know
what we're buying
i think it's cute all you all you uh
nerds in chat backseating nl
you know you wouldn't say that stuff to
his face irl
he gets the hottest synergies he has the
zaniest runs
and he hangs out with the coolest
familiars
i'll have you know i have over 300
confirmed greedier mode victories
graduated top of my class from golden
god academy
the sound is amazing
do you know what's sick i like i i know
this is character growth okay i know
you're on the internet you're not
supposed to ever change
um i've talked a lot over the years very
ignorantly about how i thought daylight
savings
was stupid and i hate it and also had
the absolutely brain dead take
that uh fallback is better than spring
forward
i gotta tell you
springing forward has actually improved
my mood like
75 it's such a huge difference between
like
cooking dinner at like 7 p.m
and the sun is still out versus cooking
dinner at 6 p.m
and it's like as dark as it is at 3 in
the morning
like i just feel like a like a better
human being now
now i think they should just stop doing
daylight savings to begin with
but i i've recently come to terms with
the fact i think i will be a little
sad if we fall back
and i think we are falling back this
year in bc even though we're supposed to
not
you know all the that's the tears up now
let's go
all the uh all the action items on the
political agenda got sidelined because
of covet including daylight savings but
left was god hand god head i data mine
the seed
son of a
anyway daylight savings is is
i i think it's sick now that's my take
okay hold on i need corey here to tell
me which one of the
bones this is we've had this item so
much
now we can see items now you see me now
you don't
what's the name of the guy in in now you
see me now you don't
wait no i'm thinking of the movie 21
never mind
in 21 there's a british actor
oh we should have yeared the coins
instead i just yeared the shop like a
fool
no no he's also he's jim sturgis i think
is his name but just popped into my head
he's the um he's also the
the male lead in across the universe
whatever happened to that guy
wait really jesse eisenberg is in both
movies
i knew he was in now you see me i didn't
know he was in
forever 21.
i forgot it blows up now actually that's
okay i'm glad we saved the money
this gives us spirit hearts we don't
like them i don't like this either
though hold
on i think we buy none and just survive
even though there's like a restock
potential here i think you buy none and
live
and then buy heavy on the next floor
we should have used a little money for a
reroll though i think
no and now you see me the the wizards
are not
or the magicians are not wizards they're
just liars and thieves
that being said i haven't seen the movie
but i i've and this is like a
five-year-old bit
you know stolen from my own content at
this point um
but i i always will consider them
cowards for not naming the sequel now
you
don't like that would it they made a
movie it was bizarrely successful
called now you see me
sequel comes out what do they call it
now you see me too
come on like you had you had your chance
you blew it
sad
now it probably wouldn't have made the
movie any better but it would have been
a
would have been cool oh no
all the original fans of now you see me
won't know that there's a sequel out
i mean possibly but
it's confirmed worse than mamma mia oh
no
i haven't seen mamma mia i i don't know
maybe mamma mia is not that bad
i always get mamma mia confused with
hairspray mostly because i've seen
neither of them but
it's horrible hairspray is great right
like people love hairspray
but i also i mean i think it's because
they came out at a similar time
i also get mamma mia confused with uh
julie and julia
like that's just seven different names
for the same movie for me
i know one of them's a musical or
actually two of them are musicals i
guess but
don't lose the phone hard dude i gotta
keep them in my sights
like soldier 76.
the smacks send them send them
one more room
monstro monstro 2
monstro with no brim monstro monstro
with rice
uh it's 10 out of 10.
oh hey hey hey hey easy there
mamma mia and hairspray are both
fantastic
i should see more musicals sorry zoomers
cover your ears
i should see more musicals instead of
just listening to the hamilton
soundtrack over and over again but
yo dang raid hello daniel hello
how were your isaac runs
uh it's godhead
you love to see it
so that must have been sacred heart
earlier
dan raiders have been real quiet since
the new angel run just dropped
i wish we could get spirit hearts to
protect crown of light but
it is what it is what what are you big
league
chew supper oh that's right
all right now we buy
what's the best musical and why is it
the blues brothers yo no joke
blues brothers actually like incredible
movie
i'm not sold on ontaro cloth on this run
although it could be awesome where are
we getting cards from
that were i mean we get some from tarot
cloth but
i think i'd rather roll for stats
okay lump of coal i think is going to be
sick for us
spider i think is or the fly i think is
good for the
the refresh and it's pretty cheap i
actually think that the relic is
uh it's pretty low here
because it it doesn't it only pays out
with wisp charges
and it got nerfed anyway don't care
didn't ask plus you got nerfed
that's a damage upgrade now we chill
that was really good that was a very
very solid room
yo new blinding light just dropped
this is pretty cool man we got a good
run going on here
we've even got wisps wisps have actually
been created
who would have thought you could crush a
bethany run without even getting a space
bar item
not me
i can't tell if ryan actually likes
musicals or not previously i have been
a musical hater because i applied
like south park logic to them which is
like you know
uh well why don't you just have like a
conversation instead
um as i've gotten older and i've
listened to more
i'm actually like uh i'm more into them
to be honest
because sometimes songs are
better than talking well well well
oh my god we just kicked the crap out of
him
like you know what i would love to see i
would love to see aaron sorkin make a
musical
maybe about like what it's like to be
the secretary of state or something like
that
now that would be david fincher directs
aaron sorkin's first musical
it would be the biggest box office
release
in msnbc's history uh
so this is a spicy one uh i think i'm
gonna go shield
because i don't think that these like
has this been changed and buffed or is
this good
is this because this was they buffed it
okay i'm gonna believe you temporarily
i don't know it kind of looks cool at
least
i'll give it some props for looking cool
debated lol
how this dude since when is this run so
long
well new bible just dropped wait a
minute isn't there a floor on which if
we use this we die
is it this floor
the gas baby oh no more curse of
darkness
the heck is that magic eight ball
i don't think i'm gonna press it i think
i'm gonna roll wispless i'm gonna
missing the whipless
that lead off the sweetness away you
know you know but i'm talking about the
shins
any garden state fans here this one goes
out to all the garden state fans
i just watched your skyrim series it's
ironic
back then you used to talk about
hamilton with a bit of contempt
i too uh find it ironic that that old me
uh used to have such strong opinions on
things that i'd
never interfaced with
the infinity bff's okay uh uh what
just happened
wait hold on did did bff just make
aquarius cover the whole floor
i don't know what happened there
apparently not but
oh those were the wisps from the
infinity
really oh it's just bugged oh fair
enough
bff and wisps bug out try any tribe
called quest fans here
this is a very very good run
it's it just got a little bit better
okay
i i have no bomb i could get a bomb but
i don't
remember what oh we still got one more
floor dude it never ends
what the heck what the heck is this
allowed
it's a great seat
i don't even know where the items are
coming from i'm happy with them no
matter what i
i love the even though it's a bug it's
pretty sick
it's very funny as are the sounds
like this run is like very high on
slapstick right now
i'm for that yeah is it that bethany
only gets angel deals or did we just get
like lucky and and get angel deals
instead of devil deals
i don't know i have no
no concept or clue
we do have homing aquarius yeah so
someone in chat said that aquarius has
uh
it it inherits tear effects from the run
a book of virtues of course
so aquarius might actually be kind of
good now so this is a big tears up right
we take those plus one to your lowest
stat we don't take those
oh we had infinite wisps
i want i want them back infinite wisps
please
those are not infinite
nevertheless um
what the heck is this chewing gum eraser
erase thine enemy
infinite wisps
no wisps
oh i forgot
scared the crap out of me man
go ahead go ahead i got my rubber made
get sent
all right i think i think we probably
got this under control
super armor though still kind of
annoying
boss armor i sleep hey you can't sleep
on this one look
can you hear the the smacking sounds
it's like you're watching uh
kung pao right now
he's dead he's broken he's actually
broken
he got lost in the peria
yeah i am excited like i don't want to
spoil anything but i have heard that uh
you know there is perhaps more isaac
than meets the eye
so and we may barely be like at the
beginning of a new generation of isaac
style content
it's it's exciting man what the heck i
never played green mode on this
you're telling me i got to put 999 cents
in this thing again
well we did unlock something there i
don't know what it was but



yeah yeah yeah here we go here we go
unban all i would never i'm i i only
touch my own on band requests i would
never do it for another streamer that's
unless they asked
all right let me get chad over here
how to get unbanned from apollo's chat i
don't know you can like
you know there's like a send a non-ban
request apologize and then maybe like
you know if you don't get unbanned in
like a week like tweet a mod or
something i don't know though like to be
honest i think
i know how this sounds but like i feel
like there's chats on twitch where if
you just
if you get banned you're just toasted
like you're just done
and uh
that that might be one of them on on my
chat i'm
pretty open with the unban requests
like especially like if you did
something
really bad like yesterday and you're
like i've changed i'm like
see in 180 days but um
if uh if you did something like the
message is from like six years ago or
something like that
and you're like you know i'm sorry i was
like 12
then yeah you get on bands
that's about it but i think there's some
channels where you're just toasted
but i would say like i would probably be
banned in apollo's chat if we weren't
friends
i would probably be banned in a few
chats if we weren't friends like in
apollo's chat i
i i'm an agitator i try to agitate
he tries to agitate here a little bit as
well don't get me wrong but
i definitely like i go in there and i
try to i try to kick up a little dirt
the only channel i know that i got
banned on i was watching
denny's like in 2014
they were doing like this arcade
competition where they had like a
frogger and an asteroids cabinet but
they changed like the lily pads to
pancakes
or something like that and i just
remember typing
in chat and like i was typing way too
fast and they uh
they eated me sent me to the shadow
realm
um do you think glowing hourglass
no because you get hit you probably
can't use it i'm thinking
i don't know i don't think it'll work
but tarot cloth ooh baby
now that's a combo i saw david you got
banned from that too
how can the developer of cook serve
delicious get banned
from a denny's stream that it doesn't
make any sense
son of a
yeah whatever i'm not scared
i'm not scared
i think i'm pretty like honestly we've
i almost just died there we've become
much more um
heavy-handed with the mods but i really
like
i mean the internet has just
consistently let me down
pretty much for my whole life right like
the reason i
didn't want to ever be super
heavy-handed with the mods is because
or with the moderation rules at least is
because i was like
i think we can just set the tone and
it'll be like
you know it'll be fine and i also don't
want the chat to just always be like
and if you know every streamer is
entitled to make the rules the way they
want
but i never wanted my chat to just be
like um
wow like love you amazing because it
makes me feel kind of weird because i
don't have that much self-respect so
when people are like
you know wow you're amazing i'm like
shut up
liar but like it just it creates kind of
a weird vibe
and i don't think it's like unique to me
i think it's something that a lot of
people
go through you know an overly effusive
praise you're like
you know you're kind of like what's
wrong with this person
that they think i'm this cool um
so i actually i always liked that there
was like a little bit of
a little edge in chat but then like
way too many uh people use that as like
a
cover to just be like genuinely mean
and then like after they were mean if
you were like hey don't be mean they
were like well they're the
chat's a reflection of the streamer haha
got you played my trump card
chat's always a reflection of the
streamer so i'm not responsible for my
actions
so we had to we had to tighten up the
rules a little bit
um
which is fine like it's okay but
you know and then like i always judge
like
when whenever like we somebody gets hit
with like a mod decision
if they're really really anal about the
mod change i'm like this is exactly the
kind of person
that i was thinking of when i made the
rule
so i know that i'm on the right track
yeah it used to i mean it was never like
insanely lawless here
like i takes i i resent sometimes when
people are like oh it's like
it used to be like hell but it used to
be much worse
just in general the community used to be
like
i mean it's not even well it is
definitely rude actually but
um it's the community used to be
way too like
into the interactions between people
um as if they were like you know
couldn't handle it themselves like
adults
way too many like yeah serious posts and
like
like ev if an nlss was good
the after thread would have like six
comments so people would be like this
was fun
and if if there was like even the
slightest conflict on the show
there would be like 150 comments in the
thread and you're just like oh my god
dude
freaking it's terrible
this is so much better now
okay this is we're dead we're alive
it was a weird time for sure
why does this run suck we just got good
items
you should check out the denny's channel
it looks like they unban me let's go
not gonna lie reading those comments was
my version of watching reality tv
no i like i hear you completely because
sometimes like if a streamer messes up
i go to their uh their subreddit or i go
to like a live stream fail and i see all
the comments and i'm like
you know snacking and eating all the
watch reading along with the comments
and laughing right
but when it's about me i'm like no no
thank you
touch grass please
bugs bunny new exactly
is it harder to interact with chat as
you get larger
well first off thank you for saying i'm
getting larger i appreciate that
um but yes but i think it's good
like and this is uh i'm sure there's
other streamers that that say this i'm
just not privy to it
but like i'd like streams better
when the stream is entertaining
and not merely like a parroting of
things that are happening in chat
it depends like you know if if i'm in
the chat
like i want them to read my comment i
totally get it
but then sometimes i like watch a stream
and they're like just answering
you know like the same questions in chat
over and over and i'm like
i'm gonna watch like some like 19 year
old kid try to do like a handstand on
his uh
wii fit balance board and then fall over
and
like kick his shelf you know it is it's
a hard balance to strike you you got
that right
like when i'm on a wave of like when i
have
motivation for what to talk about i want
to keep talking
uh and i want to keep that momentum
going because i think it can lead to
some funny or entertaining dialogue
and then the other 93 of the stream
where i don't know what i'm gonna talk
about at all
you glance over to chad steal something
answer a few questions
that's my take on it
tv show with a phone in line when you
want it dude i think running a talk show
would be sick
i don't think you could do it on uh
on twitch without probably accidentally
getting yourself banned but
yeah code miko i mean she's been i don't
know been banned like three times or
whatever
so like i that's what i'm saying it's
like a spicy line to
to ride
but if you can if you can strike that
balance i think it's cool
i do think it's a you know it's just a
philosophical difference
lock way up i have no idea this is worth
anything and we're giving up like an
incredible item
or an incredible trinket for us at least
dude i mean i okay so like we can get
demon hearts out of bad phd which is
worth nothing for us
succubus is kind of incredible though i
think it's worth giving it a try
and then i think you know what
let's take it let's have fun you'll lose
it once you take damage
oh no saved
what are your thoughts on hot tub
streamers dude so i have a very
simple uh philosophy related to like
what anybody else is doing on twitch
like it doesn't really matter to me
at all essentially like at all at all
and i don't i really don't understand
like why it matters
to other people as well
[Laughter]
because like i don't know maybe it's
because i i started on
it's booster pack right yeah maybe it's
because i started on youtube
saved and like on youtube people are
doing all sorts of crazy stuff right
and let me out
i wonder if you know what i got a genius
idea um
like it i never at all in my life i
guess have ever
looked at youtube and seen like somebody
like breaking the rules and been like ah
they're taking my viewers you know
i've always been like i'm not willing to
okay now you're gonna get me in trouble
in the other direction i was gonna say
i'm not willing to debase myself
to you know it's not the kind of content
i feel comfortable making to put it
politely
so i you know i i look at it as like you
know is twitches
and youtube in general as well it's a
huge pool right like
whatever people are doing i don't think
it really has an impact on me
and i i i don't know i just i'm
surprised that so many people who
appear to be like adults actually like
care about the like when stuff like that
is happening like when they're asleep
and like
get really mad about it online but maybe
i'm i'm missing
something related to it i don't know
these like people worry about it like
delegitimizing twitch and i'm like what
are you talking about
it's a site where people like play with
toys for a living
like the the biggest streamer on the
platform had to go offline yesterday
because he forgot to pay his electric
bill
like the website is it's not that
serious i don't understand why you
you're acting like they're gonna pop the
bubble of like
uh professionalism that we got going on
here
that's all i got like i don't know
i even the argument like the oh like
they make it so hard for like other
streamers to get discovered i'm like i
don't know what you're talking about
nobody is looking nobody that's looking
for that
is also simultaneously
shopping for your stream you know like
they're just it's two different
urges like in the sims they're
completely separate bars
they have no connection to one another
that's not to say that the hot tub
streams only
fill up one kind of bar i'm sure there's
a lot of trench and dialogue happening
as well
plus you can get horned up watching my
stream by accident every time i say
freaking
sexy succubus
see there you go anyway that's all i
like i don't think that's
delegitimizing twitch at all
anytime i see someone be like like i get
asked all the time like and now what do
you think about like current twitch
drama and i'm like the number one thing
i think is delegitimizing twitch is like
the 10 000 people under every post on
twitch
uh that they post on twitter i should
say being like what's
happening with the streamer this
streamer this streamer and yet this
stream are still around oh don't release
a new windbreaker just ban this person
instead
now i'm pretty that makes me way more
embarrassed about the platform than like
oh at 2am like somebody's wearing a
bikini on stream dude
doesn't bother me at all
i care about real things like you know
efficient market theory
i can fly it's okay hold on
you don't think advertisers are gonna
overreact to something negatively
i mean i what i don't think is i don't
think that question is where the
the anger comes from at all like
the streamers who are angry about this
stuff you know
that's kind of like a twitch corporate
issue instead of like you know
bunch of random uh people on on
twitter i just i'm just worried the
advertisers are gonna
are gonna be upset it's not me dude it's
the advertisers
okay keep it moving i mean we could
pivot off of this everyone agreed with
me i don't know why the vibe is uh
negative every time i looked at chat it
was like uh
people were like this guy's got it all
figured out and i was like thank you me
okay that's good stuff
i think the only realistic argument is
people want clear
understandings of the rules okay like i
understand that but
and this is where it's really just like
you know this is a me
thing but i'm like i don't understand
why you're so concerned with the
uh the rules all the time like are you
are you doing streams that are like
constantly pushing up against the rules
and you're like
lying awake at night that you're gonna
get banned or something like that like
i don't know man i'm not saying like oh
like would it what are you doing that's
causing the problem i mean i guess
that's literally what i'm saying but i'm
like
i guess i'm of the opinion that like for
the most part at least the way i stream
i don't run up against it
but then again you know i don't you know
toe the line by doing irl streams where
people do text-to-speech donations that
are like sound like threats in public
places and stuff like that so
it's just a different kind of different
kind of culture and vibe here i think
or yes watching every video that chad
links you uh
like uh dude there's nothing i could do
it was media share
what am i supposed to do not play the
video when people donate five dollars to
the stream
but anyway like i i shouldn't have even
talked about it not because like we went
down a negative road or anything like
that but just because
like i like existing as kind of like an
enclave if that makes sense
i like being within twitch but like
outside of twitch as well
what the thing is really cool about and
and there's other streamers like this as
well
but perhaps some more sodium chloride
next time
but we kind of like we didn't like bud
off of twitch culture we kind of like
imported the culture from
youtube that had already been cultivated
on the channel a little bit
which is is neat you know we kind of got
to
we imported an audience that already
existed
rather than having people like you know
bubble in from twitch at first and and
and then have to interface that way
because like i mean i said this many
times but like
when back in like 2013 it took me like
years to figure out what any twitch
emotes meant i didn't even know what
like
like pogchamp meant i was like when did
people use pogchamp it took me it took
me forever
that's that's how much i was uh tinted
skull
that's how much i was like riding my own
wave and then i was like oh
twitch emotes i'll never use those and
then i was like
wait a minute when i don't know what to
say i can just say
pog champ and everyone in chat will be
like this guy's hilarious
[Laughter]
yeah the card is glowing i think because
we have tarot cloth it's a little
it's a little weird but i'm for it
you said that already it's cause it's a
vod
he's cracked the code what's your
opinion on air fryers yo that's like
banter
kerosene i've been using our air fryer
literally every time i cook dinner last
night i had hello fresh
it was like have brussels sprouts peel
and
slice carrot into half inch rounds
and cut potatoes into quarters then put
them in the oven for 450
they're at 450 for 22 to 24 minutes
and i said nah dude you know what i'm
gonna do i'm gonna put those brussels
sprouts
and i'm gonna put those uh wait hold on
what time is it
uh we can maybe make boss rush i'm gonna
put those brussels sprouts and those
carrots
in the oven 450 for 20 minutes
and then i'm gonna take the potatoes i'm
gonna put those in the air fryer
400 for 20 minutes they came out
nice and crispy like so much
better i forgot you can't do that
turned out so much better than just oven
baked potatoes
i've become a a true believer
like anybody that gets bogged down in
the the argument of semantics about
whether like an air fryer is just an
oven
you're missing the point it's sick
it it crisps food like to an
unbelievable degree we're not gonna make
boss rush
now i don't know if you would cook
everything in it but like
i i absolutely i will i will
use the air fryer when i'm also using
the oven that's how much like i could
just throw the potatoes in the oven but
i'm like nah dude
it's worth it i'll use them both
you could totally get a regular oven
that has a convection setting as well
though
yeah i mean i suppose i could just you
know instead of buying an airfryer for
like 200 bucks i could just you know
pay someone to rip out my existing range
and then replace it with a brand new
oven even though this one's like only
two years old and then
i don't know spend like a couple grand
on a
a brand new oven that has a convection
setting in it or is literally just made
out of air fryers but
i don't know what's up with the anti-air
fryer agenda man it's crazy
people like i don't buy pots i just cook
things in the plate
i just put the ceramic plate on the
stove yeah it gets a little burned but
just leave my my food in a ziploc bag
out in the sun
come back 36 hours later it's all the
same
that's so slight logical extreme
caffeine pill dude how are we alive on
this busted run
like this is an embarrassment
okay never mind it's pretty good
donkey donkey donkey
like i'm kind of like all the proof i
need about an air fryer
cannot be found with
look all i'm trying to say is everything
you need to know about an air fryer
you'll figure out by tasting the food
not by getting
arguments online



everybody i'm excited as always we're
playing some repentance we got a little
meme rich i would say
during the uh the last few episodes
where we tried to be uh
you know the the world's zaniest bloody
mary player let's just you know act like
we've been there before
we're going to play as judas we're going
to get some hp upgrades we're going to
try to steamroll the alt path
like i know i'm capable of
[Laughter]
a little spooky little spooky
either way dude i know like i'm setting
up comedic timing right now
but now that i'm not like room one when
you're not
on the alt path it seems like i'm in
easy mode even though i have
one hp i would rather have like one hp
on the non alt floor than
have like 12 hp on the first alt floor
like it's too much
now that being said the shot speed of
the new enemies it can be a little spicy
time to time
did he unlock bethany yet oh you you
sweet summer child
not only have i unlocked bethany but
i've unlocked
the real gigabrain character
and or should i say characters
and i've gotten uh
a little bit further down the unlock
tree as well i might add
so this is a very uh tough choice here
to be honest with you
i don't know man what do you think about
uh
what do you think about book of belial
versus jar of flies
well book of belial plus seven cents
worth is versus jar of flies i'm a jar
man i think personally
scales better with your damage it's a
set it and forget it type of item i'm a
fan
hmm well um black hole i don't
love however
we can at least use it to do that that's
a pretty good return on your investment
that's not bad either honestly this is a
pretty good uh
yo this is a tuning fork man you know
what it looks like it looks like the
pinch emoji
what are you trying to say edmund what
are you trying to say
what i've learned about isaac so far is
uh
in repentance you gotta basically take
every available advantage that you can
get
you know in afterbirth plus i was used
to just bantering oh you know i've never
been to a long john silvers before he
said for the 30th time i'd love to go
sometime
even though i heard they weren't even
that good to begin with um
now i've got to like freaking fixate on
every single possible advantage because
you never know you need like
mom's knife brimstone nine lives abaddon
mauve the void and the other guppy items
just to have a chance to
to survive for four floors it's crazy
those hush puppies though can i can i
ask you something i don't know what a
hush puppy is i've eaten a few in my day
is it just excess batter that has then
been
like deep fried
it's just fried batter it's fried
cornmeal i had no idea thank you for the
the intel i honestly did not know
isn't a hush puppy a slushie okay i
don't know if that's a canadian thing
but you're actually right
like um we do have
he's uh genius we do have a a brand of
very popular slushie called hush puppy
it is like a blue dog with white ears
and it's on the side of those plastic
jugs with the little mixer in it that
goes around like
oh they're called slush puppies slush
puppies that's right
my mistake
i haven't been to a gas station with a
slush puppy in a long time
long time
i say no to this
i'm i'm all down with the deep fried
stuff man i'm i'm with it either way
pretty much no matter what they've deep
fried i'm down with it
as a new viewer i desire to know your
opinion on salad dressings
um i'm uh i so here's the thing
in general i prefer a vinegar-based
salad dressing to uh like a mayonnaise
or sour cream based salad dressing
but the exception there is that
like caesar dressing and ranch dressing
i wish they weren't but they are they're
delicious
love them both
i don't get down with like the french
dressing or the russian dressing too
much
maybe on a reuben i'm gonna let i'm
gonna think about this for a moment i'm
just gonna think about this for a moment
don't let it percolate out through the
old brain area
this is a tough decision because like i
think mysterious multi-dimensional baby
is actually like pretty good
uh but the downside is that what the
other item could be anything
[Laughter]
that's my opinion on salad dressing
probably not as divisive as
as you would have thought but um
that's that's what i got
and that's it i love it or hate it you
watched
that's all you could do i'm pro ranch
i know like a a lot of people are
anti-ranch
i i would first point out that uh i
don't know how
accurate the caricature is that like if
you live
uh you know let's say like below the
state of illinois
90 of your meals contain a component of
ranch dressing
uh i we don't have that same let's go
[Applause]
we don't have that same kind of uh
prevalence of it here
so i i get ranch quite rarely
and i enjoy it a great deal
i like ranch flavored things as well
but i don't get it too much so like
that's maybe that's why i like it
now we gotta strike a balance here i'm
gonna say four tiers
uh per second is good enough because i i
really wanted to uh
keep our hp as high as possible as well
you get a tears upgrade every time you
you lose a bone heart with brittle bones
so i i took some damage but i i will
admit
i i respect hp in this as this character
as well
or not is this character just in general
okay i'll play it one time
what do you think about weighted
blankets we need the speed unfortunately
weighted blankets i don't have one um
but we got a
a weighted um
sleep sack for our baby and she's been
sleeping like a freaking dream
it's beautiful
how dare you after everything we've been
through
i got nothing against uh a weighted
blanket
you know why not not hurting anybody
i mean i sleep with earbuds in which is
really kind of like having a weighted
blanket
uh you know for your uh
for your mind like for your brain uh
okay let's
this is a little spicy but also
i'm willing to i'm willing to go a
little hard here
and then you know what i think i will
take trash phd
worse pills and evil up lock down
but lock down would also give us a
damage up right
yeah go down to um i got no problem with
that
that gives us a demon heart then let's
sacrifice a little bit more health to
get something out of this guy maybe
a ho ho um yes
yes yes okay i don't know this is
this is mighty interesting let's put it
that way losing the the
jar of flies is something that's not
necessarily amazing
but constantly getting i mean let me put
it this way
i'll go lock down all day that doesn't
bother me in the slightest
to get a damage upgrade at the cost of
my luck
no concerns and then to use
like our our pseudo trash pills will
become demon hearts
bro i mean it would be mighty nice like
we would probably be able to get uh
we'd probably be able to win with that
i'm sorry to say that i think it has to
be done even though it ruins our
our the synergy we literally just got
it it kind of has to be taken to give us
a chance to win
it's not anti-zane and i'll tell you why
we're still going to get pills no matter
what they they spawn constantly whether
we want them or not
and then secondarily the alt path is
freaking hard man
getting some some demon hearts is is
extremely
uh prudent
it only gives half demon hearts snail or
half spirit hearts okay that's a ripoff
i'd like to speak to the manager
oh dude freezer baby is sick anyway i
still think it's positive
you know you can't judge something based
on you know the nerf necessarily you
gotta judge it based on its impact
i think it's impact even if it only
gives us half a heart i think is
uh it's quite valuable freezer baby is
incredible too
like this this is a darn good setup we
got to save two bombs
i don't know what you do so i need you
to die because i think you create
like a cloud and win that cloud explodes
like everything inside of the vapor
explodes as well
so i'm just gonna try to keep you at a
distance what the heck is that your
elbow
youtube we like it okay
it's a lock upgrade okay look at that
look at that we're back
we can actually pick up
some pills from this point onwards
anyway minus one luck we're pogged up
how do you feel about mayonnaise
do can i tell you something last night i
made some like
uh salmon shawarma and the garlic sauce
was literally just
chopped i need this like minced garlic
mixed with mayonnaise and lemon juice
mayonnaise i don't really love that much
then when i put the lemon juice and
bro my alt path that's that's fine we'll
just do it next floor
yeah we'll do it next floor um
when i just think about mayonnaise by
itself i'm like ah whatever
when you add garlic and and lemon juice
to it i was like wait a minute this is
actually delicious
you didn't even go to the mirror
dimension
here we go again that's what i get man
that's what i get i i try to bring
banter to the to the
equation
that's what i get
thanks for asking me the questions chad
trying to be entertained i really
appreciate it
hold on hold on this is this is one you
just gotta do
thank you mods you're so good how did
you know we like a hundred messages came
in
and you knew exactly which one i was
about to hit with the 24-hour band
permanent
okay let's live here let's live yeah i
thank you apology accepted for asking
about the mayonnaise there's like a lot
of new stuff in the game i i gotta
prioritize my own brain okay
should have used yogurt instead you you
could direct your uh
concerns to the hellofresh corporation
it i it came with the mayonnaise in the
in the meal prep kit as a result i was
kind of gated by
supply no you didn't come
on because like someone in chat said i
used to date a guy who wants to
wash his face with mayonnaise no you
didn't
stop lying nobody like that go post that
on
workshop that a little bit and then post
it on our slash relationships
hello my boyfriend 27 male washes his
face with mayonnaise
i keep telling him to stop but he
refuses he says it's good for his skin
what can i do and then it'll get posted
by the twitter account that's like r
slash reddit ships or whatever
there's no no you didn't nobody
explained to me the origin story of how
this person started washing their face
with mayonnaise
and i because i i can't imagine
oil and dry skin it could work no
they they make like lotion it's probably
cheaper to use on your face than
mayonnaise to begin with
that's like only my boyfriend washes his
face with gasoline
you know hey it's petroleum you know
petroleum jelly
we need we need more than one degree of
plausibility okay
this this didn't happen
wait big ed from 90 day fiance actually
does that all right let's explore this a
little bit
is that true i didn't watch much of big
ed's season
i do have to tell you by the way i did
not um
we were talking about um marriage or
mortgage last night the netflix show
where you
uh i'm fine
uh well not you but couples choose
whether or not uh
to use like a real estate agent and a
wedding planner compete to try to get a
couple to choose their dream wedding
over a five percent down payment on a
house
um i uh i watched literally about four
seconds and then i said
absolutely not not my brand of trash
and then i literally did not get through
the first couch interview it was too
much for me
and then i watched uh eric andre's
prank movie bad trip
and i i thought it was enjoyable
this is my first time watching something
on netflix in um
probably three or four months and i i i
said you know what this is funny i i
i laughed out loud multiple times
throughout the
the movie i would give it a
a thumbs up
i enjoyed it lol exactly
i give it an lol for laughed out loud
i did not lmao at any point
but i did well no there were a couple i
know spoilers
there might have been some times i think
kate would describe myself as having
lmaoed
what would you give it on the mouth
scale so i haven't watched
a lot of movies recently um
we if i don't see something gold here
we're going gold
here um
i i haven't watched that many comedies
recently i watched the
uh i watched half of the impractical
jokers movie
and for a movie that's in very
surprisingly kind of similar
bad trip is much better
why my the choice of movie i watch is
entirely dictated by what's on
television
at the time that i watched
pretty much
hey hey what the
yeah i wasn't like so i watched uh eric
andre's last stand-up special
i didn't love it
i thought it had some funny stuff in it
but it it there was a little
you know there's a little up and down
but uh the bad trip as a movie i was
like this is this is a solid movie for
sure
i'm trapped oh
we have an easter baby today
how about that
hello my easter baby
hey now i know why they call it good
friday
could i show her the bunnies
oh she'll show off her clothing okay
steal this look yeah hey
hey baby okay
there you go
she looks like she's from stardew valley
i told kate yesterday but i took the
baby for a walk
and uh hold on can i get in here
yes um
after like 10 minutes she was just
chilling
after half an hour she was like asleep
like this
after 45 minutes she was asleep like
you know like when they when they put
the astronauts in like the zero g
simulator and or the the g4 simulator
and they spin them around until they
pass out
she looked like that she was like only
the harness was was keeping her up
it's a cool looking baby no doubt about
that
happy easter good friday happy 40th uh
day since the vernal equinox
since pascal's full moon rock tinted in
the room after the big room
buddy i'm gonna need you to look at the
amount of bombs on my person right now
would you describe this as an all-cap
situation right now
i will not be hit
i like this boss i'm still any new boss
i'm mad at oh he's got his elbows out
again any new boss
i'm mad at because i don't know how to
dodge them all right now
now the all caps may return
thank you if you're staying down for a
minute i'm sure tomo's gonna walk back
in in a second anyway
but um someone said dan's chat
has desensitized me to all chat or all
caps
i i was dying in dan's chat earlier he
played as the keeper
oh i really thought that would get both
but he was playing as the keeper
and he walked into one of the alt path
rooms that had the
item rooms i should say that had like a
an item and then a question mark
the item was sack of pennies
and he just like waited 45 seconds and
then took the other item
i forget it was because he and his chat
were like distracted he was like you
know
you know chat what are the odds that
like you know
it was something like the mayonnaise
play that i just made you know what are
the odds that like mayonnaise and yogurt
are just the same thing with a different
name and i was the only person in chat
losing my mind i was stunned at the
culture difference
i'll i'll be like you know wrist deep
in banter and like chad will be like 99
like you left uh a coin behind 17 rooms
ago
dan basically walked into a room that
was like a free win
uh as the keeper and everybody in chat
was like
100 100 100 00 seventy five percent
and i was in chat going like please
please
take the take the sack of coins man
it'll change everything okay that's
that's pretty good i can i can live with
that
i was trying to get in the front seat
you're gonna have to do a little better
than this we'll take this just in case
we need it
what do you think about dan saying he
could beat you in a fight
16 months ago he'd be in the hospital
now he's probably right
i'm not in peak physical form
i think i i have nothing to complain
about there i think he's absolutely got
it uh
he's got it bang on
he has a degree in fitness exactly how
am i supposed to compete with somebody
who has a a master's degree
in kinesiology
he's been working out in the library
have you gotten a vaccine yet don't even
get me freaking started man don't even
get me freaking started
we're still and again like it's better
than we thought it would be like three
months ago but
30 to 35 year olds in in bc
scheduled for uh early june
so we still got a ways to go
i i was laughing because i i complained
about uh
like the how slow the vaccine was coming
in which is
i i get it by the way but i'm still
gonna complain because it sucks
i'm not saying there's any action items
but it's like i wish it was here
faster in bc at least but um
you're doing the same thing that i was
just gonna make fun of actually where
people are like oh must be nice
you might not have your vaccine but i
live in you know
brazil and my parents don't even have
their vaccine yet my
parents and i'm like yeah i live in
canada
my parents don't have the vaccine yet
either
we're on the same page you're trying to
get like weird stolen valor that you
don't even understand
that's the state of brazil that's the
state of canada man
okay hold on hold on
this is big this is good we definitely
want this
i think we want sack dagger as well
really it's like america is just
crushing the vaccine game right now
they they've been playing out of their
gourds
the rising through the power rankings
like crazy there's no doubt about it
you gotta you gotta recognize you know
that uh
there were there were some issues with
pandemic response i think it's polite to
say um
but also like i'm watching people you
know in texas
that don't have underlying conditions
just be like
like they're picking their own brands
it's crazy
they're like i'm gonna wait six days and
i'm gonna get the johnson johnson
instead of the pfizer and i'm like i'll
just can you just like spit in my mouth
after after you get it i'll just take
whatever i can get at this point
can i just can i just take can i smell
the vaccine before they
they shoot you up with it
just give me like a just a sample just
an amuse boosh if you will
yeah new york right now is anybody over
the age of 19.
dude i mean honestly like dad's sick am
i a little mad
yes but i'm not mad at the people
getting vaccinated i'm you know
i'm just mad in general
i just want mine the easiest way to make
me
genuinely happy for everybody instead of
begrudgingly happy while also lamenting
my own
unvaccinated uh state would be if they
just gave me the vaccine
think about think about how good that
would be
it's worth it man
i think for for the utilitarian good of
the world i should probably be next in
line
yo this was well worth it how fun would
that be
in 10 days 16 plus are legal in illinois
see that's the kind of stuff that'll
turn you into the joker man
when you when you watch uh
teenagers getting vaccinated in america
and then also
like heartwarming clips from like the
san diego zoo where they're
vaccinating like pandas and stuff like
that you're like come on
the pandas
all right we're doing well here
how much will the vaccine change your
behavior it seems like you stay inside a
lot
it'd be really nice to like let my
parents see their their only
granddaughter
just just minor superficial stuff like
that
it's not as important as other people
who are like really excited for like
patio season
and like you know having some pints uh
with their friends but
just just minor selfish stuff like uh
like that
[Laughter]
wait wait wait okay hold on balloon what
is this a red bag
all right let me let me close this door
real quick
okay okay
enemies shoot red tears when killed i
don't know how good it is
but it's worth something
but is it worth as much as
gimpy i don't think so hold on hold on
it has to be done
it's very simple i wish you could give
like a timeout message the message is
just be nice
anyway moving on i think we made the
right decision on that one
mods are there timeout requests
like on timeout requests you know how
there's like
like real court and then there's like
small claims court where it's like oh he
scratched my truck or whatever
there should be like small claims on
band requests
there's a use of channel points there
somewhere ah
now we're talking
now we're talking okay let me think let
me think this is ash pit one
ash pit one
means we don't have to worry about
getting the mine carts on this on this
floor
we need hp though like hp is is precious
here
if we got enough uh red hearts actually
gimpy can probably
stand a reasonable chance of helping us
get to a win or or a reasonable
facsimile of a win
um right now it's not quite good enough
we don't have the red hard base to make
it work i'm calling that that enemy that
i just murdered without
even seeing them there actually the most
annoying enemy in the game
the like little baby larry juniors or
whatever
little baby skull x's
can only be hurt for like you know one
nano second
that hurts man that hurts good deal with
the devil though
dude freaking nine lives nine lives with
slap right now
sadly nothing takeable i wish it weren't
the case i took too much damage
can't be done
guppy's caller is nine lives on occasion
i suppose that's true
could be infinite lives you know nine
lives is nine lives but guppy's
collar could be anything it could even
be nine lives
i want you know what i haven't seen in a
shop in a hundred years
uh a reroll machine
see an awful lot this this would be
amazing hp
see an awful lot of shops that contain
absolutely nothing of value but
okay that's big hp now oh no
[Laughter]
hp we should we should remain very
thankful of
it's very precious
one bomb blows up the reroll machine now
you know what now that i've thought
about it for two seconds i actually
think that that's not a horrible change
but you could because you can just use
money instead you know i'll admit
fully like part of the issue
with like the the nerfs in the patch is
that i just got too used to
like the leverage you got from kind of
abusing the
abusing the things that maybe were not
meant to originally be like that
that's fine we'll just i mean we want
this demon judgment
yeah shops used to be like a serious
engine for just
dominating the game
no question there love golden bombs
love to see golden bombs
what are the nerfs oh it is i mean let
me count the ways right
a little spicy um lots of lots of items
got
nerfed the you know shops in general got
nerfed in hard mode
drop rates uh are way down in hard mode
i'm actually and i know how this sounds
like you can't say
something positive about a game without
being accused of being a shill
the only kind of criticism that comes
across as genuine is when you're mad
uh but i actually think making the game
harder was a wise decision
that's what we're looking for and the
the problem is less that
the game is harder and more that it was
so easy for so
long that like the nerfs seem unfair as
a result i think
you know the the culture that surrounded
isaac
from after birth plus onwards was like
you know we get used to winning 75 times
in a row without even focusing on the
game at all
so i think having a period where things
are a little difficult makes uh
it's refreshed it it is like
the runs are long
[Laughter]
dude but look at this if if we were
playing as judas in afterbirth plus
we never would have like had this uh
scrape to get to where we're at right
here
where we're like so excited to see a
second judgment
but we can still use this to possibly
get into a second secret room
uh and get like a bunch of spirit hearts
out of it
we'll talk about that in a second
i mean i think that uh
i it was easy to believe that isaac
didn't get that much easier and instead
it was just an unbelievable amount of
experience
that led to you know being able to win
90 to 95 percent of runs easily but now
i'm coming to terms with the fact that i
don't think that's the case
ah you're absolutely right i got two
golden chests here
it's it's a little pogged
yeah i think people will get used to it
for sure i mean the other thing is you
know if you if you play on the normal
path
can i push these hearts off of here that
would be nice if you play on the normal
path
it's still harder but it's not so much
harder as
to be like uh
like ridiculous that's still fine we'll
bring the
the portable slot machine into there um
the old path is insanely tough but the
the other path is not so bad
just just relax
we got like another i don't know
probably like four to five minutes on
this floor before we leave
don't save some adrenaline we're not
this is like floor three
maybe floor four now that i think about
it but
we it's a marathon this is a marathon
not a sprint
thank god we got luck stats
i screwed it up or maybe it's been
changed
i don't know but this it did not work
the way uh
the way i thought it would
why play in the cathedral some of you
ain't been here since uh after birth
plus and it shows
we got so many red hearts we're gonna
get a pay out here for sure
demon beggar no longer takes eternal
hearts before red hearts
that's something i i'm prone to believe
but i'm also going to say that
old habits die hard and also i don't
believe you
[Laughter]
it might be true but we got baited a
couple times over the course of isaac so
far
over the course of repentance's release
that i'm just gonna be uh
i'm gonna i'm gonna do things my own way
because it you know
i mean it doesn't seem to offer any
difference for the time being
i did see and and it's i i message dan
about it
because i want i want dan's insight how
is it that
um
mlb the show is made by sony
it used to be a sony exclusive
this year it's coming out uh on
xbox as well
is this our this is not our floor okay
i'm good i don't know
the blood bank maybe it doesn't take the
eternal hearts but still i don't want to
risk it
it's coming out on the xbox as well
free on game pass you you really i i was
uh i've got my playstation 5 in my
office for
you know recording purposes so i was
like i'm going to get mlb the show 21
for
playstation 5 because that's the console
that you know
if all other things are equal that's
what i'll get it for but now i'm like
man maybe i gotta move my xbox
into here because it's free on game pass
it's crazy
i mean it's a big get
mlb told them to release it on xbox or
you'll lose the license
could they do the same thing with pc
please if they're going to throw their
weight around
[Laughter]
i'm trying to think of what boss this is
we should try we should try
what uh uh flying
this is this is new to me and they leave
behind turrets huh
i've never seen this variant of the boss
before
yeah the show is sick i've blown up the
the turret
hey come on
at least they gave me some bombs
otherwise we could have been screwed
here
though that's so good okay we didn't get
the deal with the devil i was looking
for
but
we're gonna do this we're gonna do this
we're gonna do this okay
now we explore
i am stoked though but i am like you
know as it comes out for more consoles
like here's the thing
i guess i don't mind
uh exclusivity in the sense that i guess
i take it as
you know kind of a unnecessary evil of
competition
um but when it's only on two consoles
and not uh excuse me sci-fi
and not on pc i'm like come on man
just if you're gonna like you know kiss
and make up could you also do it on the
pc
like to be honest mostly selfishly for
me but still
scifly is a one run really
you know i'm excited to see if that ends
up being the case
how the heck do i watch nl's repentance
in order
there is a way to do it you're not gonna
want to hear it though
i'm being 100 serious with you um
you'd have to basically
figure out what day the youtube episode
for that day was recorded on
and then also watch all of the twitch
vods
every day in chronological order it's
doable
you know you you could watch if you
wanted to watch in chronological order
you would watch
uh the first episode the second episode
the third episode
then watch the entire uh series of
twitch vods from the first day
then you'll watch episode four then
you'll watch yesterday's whole isaac vod
then you'll watch episode 5 then you'll
watch all of today's twitch vod
the other thing you could do is like
don't worry about it too much just let
it go
and then accept that it's going to be
hard to watch it in chronological order
while we're playing a little bit on
youtube and a lot on twitch
and you know just just pog up i guess is
what i'm trying to say
i think that's that's the best way
there's a very like fuzzy through line
between both of them as well like
for the most part you're not missing too
much it's a lot of
mostly just banter coefficients
let me out please
i need to hit the button dude can i tell
you this is a spoiler
um yeah just uh pick one and then fall
asleep to it like
like my average viewer sonova
time to go back to among us
um i i did this earlier today
as jacob and esau and took no damage
i know you're not gonna believe it
you'll believe it when you see it and
you'll be ashamed of your words and your
deeds
is one of the proudest accomplishments
in in gaming i've ever achieved in my
life
nope see ya wouldn't want to be a
wouldn't wouldn't want to see you either
to be honest but definitely wouldn't
want to be a hello indie by the way i
see you indy
look doing uh
research for your next video 10 hottest
babes in isaac no clickbait edition
um he spawned on me
look at that no problem
got him
[Laughter]
number one mama mega for sure
for sure hmm
okay i gotta tell ya shoop the whoop
is pretty great guppy's head is nice but
shoot the whoop
i will not be persuaded
can you do an indie mouse impression
yeah it's it's like this
24-hour band permanent
you know what what if there's a crawl
space in there low odds let's get out of
here
all right we're still going
still alive mausoleum one let me tell
you i
i need hp here
excuse me do not refer to uh to indie
mouse as an
nl orbiter indie mouse is
is well on his way to like like many
content creators who have been inspired
by me indy's well on his way to being
uh better at the the youtube game than
i am
he got passed by by markiplier
um
small ant i think for sure
which is like it's my whole long term
business model is just to
inspire enough content creators that
strike it rich that one day i could be
like their little court jester
i could be like their worm tongue or
like the the little
weird rat that sits next to a jab of the
hut
somebody launches like a new variety
show i can be like
[Laughter]
it's kind of like i you know i've been
in the game too long it's
it's time for me to uh to
descend and and regress but in almost a
positive way i think
to uh to sidekick i think i think
i'm i'm done being the main guy just
make me a sidekick man that seems like
it seems like where it's at
or we could just start doing cameos
that's true
yeah i'm working on my ex's strategy
unfortunately they they kind of like got
rid of mcns on youtube so i can't just
like
you know start my own uh quote-unquote
business and then uh
take ten percent of like everybody
else's money on the platform
for doing nothing uh hold on hold on
i meant for doing uh something an
essential service
uh
yoink
[Laughter]
i don't know what sci-fly does but i do
know that when it touches something
they die instantly which is pretty sick
i've only seen episodes one three and
five of star wars how do i know
salacious crumbs name and also the name
of uh anakin's mom
oh you mean shmee skywalker
excuse me that now that that's a nerf
too far edmund when you get two blood
banks
you can't play both of them at the same
time that's too
far
that's that's a malicious nerf
and a salacious crumb where's the line
edmund
where's the line
well that was my bed
you can do it with a shield yeah for now
until repentance five the
re-repentancing comes out
there we go
whatever man i might just eat the whole
run here that's that's how i'm feeling
right now
it's a handful i mean i do appreciate
the money but
only one penny per hit too
when is it gonna be enough edmond when
is it going to be enough i'm being
mostly
facetious that one is though i'm like
hey come on
we we held on to that temperance car
that that's not like a situation where
you know that was happening all the time
i think that's that's a pretty
fringe case there
when will you learn that your actions
have consequences
i appreciate the banter injections by
the way toasty
when was the last time you donated blood
so it look i'm gonna pref
you got me i'm gonna preface this by
saying
it's donating blood is a good thing to
do the last time i donated blood
was maybe like a month after i came back
from korea
and uh i understand the reason for this
like why they feel like they need to ask
the questions
but uh in order to give blood it's
normally like a i don't know maybe like
an
hour long experience this time because i
had the audacity to go live in like
another first world country for uh
for a year um they had they took me into
a
private office and then pulled out a
binder and it had like
maps of south korea in it and they were
like did you ever
like step foot in this part of the
country and i'm like
i don't think so like i i mean i took
the train around on occasion but
uh i don't think i uh
i don't know if i ever walked through
like knee-high
grass in in yonsan or whatever right
like
so it it took like a long time
and just that was uh was enough for like
any time they've they harangued me from
that point onwards i was like
you know i i don't have that kind of
time quite frankly
back then and then uh secondarily like
when i moved to vancouver kate doesn't
uh like she has low iron
so she can't give blood uh so you know
we can't really make it a family thing
i'm not really trying to make excuses
i'm just saying that
you know
that's about it
[Laughter]
i think i'm like i can't get to the
chest so i can blow them up
but i can't get to them without stepping
on the spikes
oh let's go well worth it
but i don't know i've probably given
blood
i've been like like
20 times from the age of like 16
to 24.
i never minded it
i have uh oh i got the blanket that's
right i've been so like
lost in the banter sauce
i know this oh geez this is like the
ultimate like
complaints and this is more of a young
man's complaint for sure
the stars are calling okay
says the stars are calling gave me a
fool card
because that makes sense um
i think i made the right decision to
keep hp here i also forgot by the way
that this is an hp up so i am willing to
take it
i thought that was tnt maya sotis
i don't remember what you do but let's
do it um
i didn't i also didn't like when i
donated blood that like they made me sit
there
for 15 minutes admittedly they gave you
like a cookie don't get me wrong
i i i didn't enjoy that i was always
like i'm built different just let me go
i don't want to eat this cookie and like
watch everybody loves raymond or
whatever
i mean for other people i understand but
like come on
stop uh splitting
yeah plus they give you low tier snacks
i got to watch seinfeld and eat candy
bro that's
like maybe they're right about the
canadian medical system
wait hold on have i been to the item
room here
because i i don't know where i'm going
anymore i thought i did
yes no yes yes no no maybe
you got capricorn in it ah
some things they're just not worth it
man
no i'll do it for the vaccine for sure
i if they if you know i saw apollo tweet
like um
that he's driving two hours for the for
the vaccine
100 i would uh
i would do the same thing
i might even walk 500 miles to be honest
with you
would i walk 500 more no that's that's
too many that's a thousand miles
what was that was what was i talking
about i was talking about donating blood
oh yeah they always got like they
weren't
look sometimes i i donated blood and i
got
cool uh like they give you oreos or
something like that
those were the days man
but sometimes they only had like like
mom's oatmeal cookies or something like
that and i was like
come on just let me go dude you're gonna
make me watch half an episode of yes
dear
and give me like a a 30 cent cookie like
i'd rather just be home
okay so now i remember mystosis is
it gives you all the consumables you
didn't pick up on this floor on the next
floor
that's actually pretty sick
they're actually dad's oatmeal cookies
can i tell you what happened in my head
i said in my head i thought they were
dad's oatmeal cookies
they said moms because i was like dads
is a root beer
like you ever have dad's root beer in
the glass bottle
facts that was all
that was the only glass bottle soda when
i was a kid
in the 30s every soda was in a glass
bottle
in 2010 they got you know yaritos and
stuff like that
they've got mexican coke
back in the 90s everything was plastic
and we liked it
okay i don't like these enemies you got
it you got to hit him on the diagonal
i think now this is about the time where
we got to get uh
serious i should donate blood again for
sure
i know this is like it's the ultimate
like first world problem
i have absolutely no like needle phobia
or anything like that
i just wish they could make it faster
not like sucking the blood out but the
security protocols in advance that's the
only thing that like
and it's very entitled don't get me
wrong
but when i go there and they're like you
know
they're like hold on we gotta give you
this like 90 question survey
so that like we know your blood is good
and then also we got to take you into a
private room and ask you the same
questions again and again to make sure
that the your blood is good
and then even after that we're going to
test it anyway
like i don't mind them testing it
obviously you got to be safe but like
i don't know if it's changed over the
past eight or nine years but
it used to be like it was like
i don't know 15 minutes of getting your
blood drawn and then like an hour to an
hour and a half of like interstitial
stuff
i get it you want to be safe and and
canada had like a big uh
you know tainted blood scandal back in i
think like the late 80s or something
like that but
it does put a damper on it
okay one last item room
is pretty messed up i mean i i respect
the blood service too like uh oh you
know what i bet that makes a path it's
it's just science like kate got a couple
of
uh blood bags
there's a speed upgrade right now okay
kate got a couple of blood bags when
uh we were in the hospital after having
the baby so like
you know we've we've used it as well
you're my war zone good luck charm nl
you never use annoying stereo sound
and i very rarely play warzone
until recently at least um which means
like
isn't that i look i'm not just a
streamer i'm also a stream viewer
there's nothing worse than like you want
to play a game
but then the streamer is playing the
same game and sound is important so you
can't tell if the footsteps are in your
game or in justin's game
and you're like oh come on man like
while i play
valerian how about you play like
something else how about you play
getting over it
like it's all about my entertainment not
yours
chocolate milk
now we're talking that's me every time
you play king of retail
you know i i didn't even think about
that but
it makes perfect sense you'll be like
getting ptsd for my games
spare two seconds or mine minecraft was
bad too yeah
deep down in the mines watching mouth
stream and
and then you know you hear like creepers
and stuff like that oh come on man don't
make me do this to not get hit
and lose my bone heart
he's done it um you'll be down in the
mines and you'll hear like
and you're like oh come on
then you realize it wasn't uh it wasn't
on your screen at all it was on mouth
screen
that's why i think that if you're a good
streamer
you should be responsive to uh chat
feedback
so if someone in chat's like hey could
you please change games cause like i'm
playing this game
i i will never remember and by never i
mean this week
remember that you've gotta not walk into
mom anymore
my bone hard
we're obviously taking the polaroid
be like hey i'm playing isaac can you
change games i'll be like sure
let's play a game no one else is playing
okay
uh let's play artifact
[Laughter]
i still don't understand what scifly is
doing but i
i do i do appreciate it wait a minute
hold on now i get a chance to look at it
scifly is breaking all the shots and
then
shooting homing shots at mom's heart
for each shot that it breaks yo that's
pretty cool so i can just stand still
and not get hit
oh my god it might help us if we make it
to the true final boss it might help us
not get hit by all those knife shots
over and over
there's a chance
please don't try to bait me into
agreeing with the unabomber's manifesto
i i i promise you we we run in different
discord communities
i every discord except for my own that
i'm a part of
literally it has like two messages a day
and it's usually like happy birthday
don't compare us we are not the same
excuse me someone asked me if uh
the industrial revolution and its uh
consequences have been an absolute
disaster for humanity
you think i didn't see that uh uh
netflix original series where paul
bettany also known as vision plays the
unabomber and uh
i forget is it joel what's what macros
the australian actor
you know the one with no personality you
can never remember his name
you know no not joel edgerton the other
one that's
exactly like joel edgerton sam
worthington
sam worthington yes thank you thank you
eric bana excuse me eric banner
was amazing in the hulk and then
secondarily also amazing
in uh
season one of ugly uh not ugly betty
dirty john the student
two different media properties
yeah plus he's in troy
don't care didn't ask plus you're
from troy
sam worthington is british wrong
oh this is sick oh
that's gonna pay
for a lot of shops in the future
dirty john married my aunt really
it's a pretty uh it's a pretty spicy
podcast
season one of the the limited series
you know entertaining but uh you know
i didn't think it was that good uh
season
two i was like you know what christian
slater amanda pete
they're bringing the amanda heat in this
one
don't hit me with ha ha hit me with
hahahaha
very funny what's the worst response to
a joke that somebody could write in text
that is like laughing i'm gonna i'm
gonna
postulate a theory okay
lol lol lamou
lamou all good
ha i actually take some pride in
if somebody says ha i'm like they
probably did not laugh
but they think it's funny but they don't
want to let me know it's funny
because it would like feed my ego
they're like embarrassed that they
laughed
or they thought it was amusing if
somebody says
ha-ha-ha with no spaces between each of
the letters
i know that they did not find it funny
but they're just being polite
like if you look at it a chat log and
it's just like
every time you say something humorous
the other person replies ha ha ha no
space
run you you do not have compatible sense
of humors
you always got to mix it up right you
gotta do like
sometimes if somebody says two things
that are meant to be funny but aren't
they funny in a row
first one i hit him with the hahaha
secondly then i hit him with like a
like an lol then i go ha ha and then i
go i see what you did there
there's like there's a mix of them
what about ha ha i don't know
like those are the two worst without a
doubt
haha and hahaha both pretty bad
dude why is little brim take so long to
charge now
f wait the fly is doing amazing work
can you just keep keep doing what you're
doing brother thank you
no i'm saved
he's going too fast what the heck is
going on here
no i'm doing good work don't punish me
i'm doing good work
oh my god we didn't get hit
surprising um
so i'll tell you we cannot take
nine lives but we can definitely try
lusty blood
hp is is extremely tight
but we definitely
feel bad about lusty blood and i'm just
hoping that like
the way that we possibly win this run is
that sci-fly
blocks tons of shots on the corpse
that's that's the game plan
please be a fortune teller oh baby we
got four
luck
we'd stack up absolutely everything
to just try to get as many spirit hearts
as possible for the corpse fight
no i don't even need crystal ball
although it would be nice
come on did you see they added stonks
meme guy to fortnite named diamond hands
uh toasty i would refer you to
yesterday's stream we talked about this
many times
i'm a big fan of uh of diamond hands
it's not bad the only problem is like
fortnite is uh is analytics poison
not not for everybody obviously like
it's a popular game
but for 32 year old boomers who are not
very good at it
it's tough
no i had there you go i have not
mentioned my um
my yahoo news article yet
i did get an uh yahoo news wrote an
article about a viral clip i made
like six weeks ago
let's not take the spirit hearts yet i
shouldn't have even picked up the ones
that we have
uh and and the
pop the stars card right away don't take
me to the boss um
the article was about the time that like
i riffed on that idea that like how do
bald people know when
to stop washing their face and then i
went really close to the camera
and uh like made wrinkles on my forehead
and i was like where the wrinkles stop
that's where your face ends and your
head begins
um yeah i don't know they wrote an
article about it
and the article is just hilarious it's
like
you know noted witty streamer responds
to a cheeky request from a troll
and then they they mind like the chat
and also uh
like the live stream fails thread of the
clip for content and there it was they
were
gassing me up pretty good they were like
you know the comments that they chose
were like honestly this is the most
naturally funny guy on twitch as far as
i'm concerned
ben this guy's been entertaining me for
10 years and i don't think he's going to
stop anytime soon it's
uh it's so good
okay like we may actually win on this
run
like we're getting a lot of
uh we're getting a lot of useful stuff
here thanks yahoo i really appreciate it
ridden by brian letournet
[Laughter]
winning yeah chibly's been pretty quiet
since the yahoo news dropped
why are you playing the blood bank i
need all the help i can get really so
like my hypothesis is like we can play
this blood bank because we have the
uh the less than three right next to it
so the dream would be you know you get
another blood bag nice little speed plus
hp upgrade
i the the chat erupted in laughter and
memeing i did see that
i was i was laughing yesterday
what if they nerfed it well then we
winning is one thing but it's actually
better to have
the ability to get mad with
justification so i
we win either way really
they really and and i actually think
that this is like a
uh a positive change but it's gonna take
some getting used to
they really nerfed the incidence of
uh tinted rocks huh like it's it's crazy
i have decided to use one bomb
he's so good
no you're just missing them
no the creep
do we know this
i'll take it shut speed up
wait he's bald yet another streamer or
yet another chatter noted in the stream
questioning whether the streamer is
actually bald
is a recurring joke in his chat it's
that's top tier
journalism
so knockout city is gonna happen at one
so that's 38 minutes from now
um which is an awkward timing for a
an isaac episode because this one will
be done in the next uh i don't know two
hours or something like that but
we'll figure it out i've got faith in us
it is the the cross play
beto weekend so there actually is or at
least should be
a a panel below the stream
you can click on that and and
get yourself a little something
something get yourself involved in the
in the cross play beta that's available
this weekend
dunk duck dunk
so the utility of keeping the spirit of
hearts on the ground
is that we'd rather lose red hearts if
possible
i know we have to right now that's
that's a mistake it's like byob
right um we can leave
spirit hearts on the ground and then
pick them all up right when we're about
to fight the boss
which allows you to have uh as much hp
as possible before the boss
this is not my first rodeo we've you
know
we've had the grind you know some tough
achievements in this game before
comedic timing
these are a little tougher than than
even the usual but
you got to do something like this yeah
not only one time but two times
all right so this is what it all comes
down to this pill is pop in emergency
uh situations only
not a not a huge deal uh
we have 36 bombs
before and like we've put a lot into
this run
before we leave for the boss fight
we must search for the secret rooms they
could change everything
we must search for the second secret
rooms
you're the second best bald isaac player
i know
that's actually like a pretty good
compliment
because uh oh there's more spirit arts
back there yeah um
that's a pretty good compliment because
cory's really good
corey is a he's a good isaac gamer
he knows what he's doing
booster pack
actually very tempting i think we got a
look at least
yo mysterious liquid undefeated actual
like
like s-tier item
now that hurts it dude i'm gonna lose so
much hp on this room
those those those cards better be worth
it
like i don't even know how to fight
these guys man good good thank you
thank you scifly
it's not possible okay lovers is a great
card though
strength two of clubs two of hearts
okay two of diamonds you just pop two of
hearts strength lovers
we can only take one in two of our
hearts are statistically better than
strength they're lovers here
we'll try the pill it's it's bad but it
i don't think it's at the point where it
like
really compromises the the game
damage is not going to be like our sore
spot here it's it's definitely going to
be
uh it's definitely going to be hp
strength for the damage highly highly
false
meet me in pleasant park i just want to
talk
i don't even know what this does but you
know what okay occasional
poison shot or bad breath or something i
don't know
okay let's do it
okay we're tap shooting we're in a tap
shoot existence
sci-fly you're actually a god
okay scifly is incredible
i don't disagree it's actually cracked
now i'm hoping mysterious liquid does oh
i forgot about that part
i'm hoping mysterious liquid does my uh
dirty work for me here
that's fair keep it going yo
sci fly is is feasting dude
bad
yeah you gotta you gotta learn to move
there
yo if you keep cycling it's a lot harder
to get hit on that huh
i didn't know i just tried to like watch
the shots as they came in
he's learning oh we're definitely gonna
win
this is exciting especially after that
terrible play earlier
was the mirror play yeah this one i just
it can't be dodged
we'll worry about that one in in 70
years
come on you got to be dead dude like
it can't be dodged
he's done he's done okay that was tough
but
look at that who would have thought
first run of the day no big deal is in
90 minutes long basically
uh but we did
unlock akuldama whatever the heck that
means
thank you scifly uh for the support
slash marker
end of repentance



hey everybody we're checking out uh some
isaac today not sure if you've heard of
this game etc etc
uh get used to the joke you know we we
make it a lot here
we're playing jacob and esau and and
we're gonna try to get
just some no-life unlocks we're trying
to get to the dark room we're trying to
unlock
uh whatever you get for completing the
dark room we're trying to give hp to the
right unit and we failed
and they do they are called units as far
as i'm concerned no
you can't just call them units uh
they're characters they have biblical
significance ha ha
uh unconscious uh vernacular goes burr
[Laughter]
the absolute unit no i have i have seen
the new door in the depths i mean i
think
i unlocked it like maybe the first or
second day but i actually have not tried
to go through it yet
i don't know how to get through it i'm
not like super
spoiler reverse but like i i would i
wish there was like a happy medium from
like somewhere between chat just being
like oh this is what you do
and like the alternative which is like
you know me struggling to figure out
what you do for like
10 years in order to figure it out like
at some point i'm sure we're just gonna
relent
i'm not much of like a mystery guy to be
honest i'm like uh
i'm really a uh
i'm just like a mechanics guy i just
like to play the game so
i i you know i accept especially given
our truncated schedule lately like
there's no chance for me to be like the
guy who uh
you know was the first person to figure
anything out this i'm not much of a
treasure hunter honestly
much more of just uh i don't know i'm
like the guy on the ship who who
rose the oars you know hallelujah
just use dad's key yo there you had we
just get dad's key
it's the only thing that matters
i think you could do it on your own
without too much trial and error
that's good to hear okay
uh hold on let's come on d10 no thank
you
key beggar actually like insulting um
it blew up anyway so it's anemia right
like
anemic all right i saw midas touch for a
second i was a little upset we couldn't
trust the midas touch but that's okay we
still have a key but we're not going to
go alt path
i don't know that we could go alt path
and then get a couple of items and then
skirt back onto the non-alt path but
we'll figure it out
how do you feel about the peeps cross
pepsi crossover
we don't get cool sodas in vancouver in
fact well not in vancouver i should say
like
in in canada where america is like a
test market for the rest of the world i
think
everybody in the u.s they're always like
hey did you see we got new plutonium
infused uh pepsi or something like that
and i'm like all we got here is like we
just got diet
that's not true i mean we've had diet
pepsi for a long time but you know it's
the it's the principle
of the thing like you know they're
talking about uh
you know in it well hold on let me just
take a little sip
you know whenever i talk about bubbly
people are like hey have you tried
bubbly bounce it's caffeinated bubbly
hey have you tried the new like you know
coconut peach flavor of of bubbly and
i'm like dude we literally just got
like there's a billboard in vancouver
from the bubbly corporation
that says hey vancouver we got peach now
we just got the default peach we don't
even have the
we don't have any special like you know
secondary flavors yet
okay we'll pop on soos control control
space of course
everybody knows that it's control space
no i did not buy a soda stream i thought
about it though it's still on the
is still on the on the list does anybody
enchant own both an
air fryer and a soda stream
which one would you say is better
because i love the air fryer
is is the soda stream as life-changing
as the air fryer
oh i have to hit every button of course
air is better 100 okay i appreciate that
i i appreciate a non-biased look at it
i don't think that so come on the only
people who own a soda stream and an air
fryer are millionaires
did you know that uh i was looking it up
um
for for investing reasons did you know
that uh
something like 48 of american households
own
a an air fryer
i don't know if those stats are legit
that's that's crazy
control q control q
whatever shut speed down control q speed
up
lock down we don't sweat that we don't
sweat that just thinking about how i
want to approach this here
there's no way that's true i don't know
i mean like
it seems like it could be plausible to
me although that admittedly that
airfryer is a fairly recent uh invention
i think like within the past decade
at least in in the proprietary air fryer
terms we don't need to go down the air
fryer road again like
just it just makes everybody upset
myself included
i'm telling you that's i mean i guess we
are going to go down the road
i mean no no my double deal chance
i shouldn't have come to the alt path
what was i thinking man
i'll i'll reiterate what i said the last
time we talked about air fryers
which is everybody who has an air fryer
is like
i like it a lot and then people that
don't have an air fryer are like no
you can't enjoy it it's just a glorified
convection oven no
your experience is invalid because of
you know
semantic reasons or something like that
everybody who owns one is like a
certified believer and you know how we
feel about believers
getting stuck i got stuck on the
freaking rock man okay we're fine
sips thinks that microwaves are for
boomers
i mean that's because sips is a is a man
of honor
i would say microwave use is is
boomer-esque at least
you know if you're part of the
generation that that grew up on kitchen
nightmares
you know you know we we don't have any
love for chef mike here
i'm gonna do it man i want to see
something here
then what's grilling oh come on grilling
is universal
everybody loves to grill little kids
love the grill
little babies love the grill
octogenarians love to grill
everybody loves a grill
so what happens when you choose what
food to eat based on
um you know how good it tastes rather
than like what it says about you as a
person in the the discord circles you
run in
like no i can't eat off the grill um i
i eat out of a sous-vide because i have
political opinions i'm like what are you
talking about just
you can grill baby grill without uh
without being grill pilled
you know what you're absolutely right we
should go to our item room
[Laughter]
okay yeah the item room is the right way
to go why grill
saucies might win it if they do for you
mate
okay yeah that's pretty good uh let's do
it let's do it let's do it let's do it
ghost baby you know it's not a it's
certainly not an even deal there but
it is what it is why am i still subbed
to this guy
i love australia australia i love
australia
top of the morning to you
love it love it
ghost baby
no macros is from australia for sure
why cook sausages win there
to do it for you mate so good
all right so now you just you know keep
your head on a swivel we probably won't
keep the alt path going here is my take
i think we'll just try to double up on
some items
while things are somewhat easy even
though we're on you know the
great risk of death without a doubt um
and then we'll try to squeeze back onto
the other path and go to the dark room
as my guess
that's my guess for now
squeam exactly dude i don't know if
we're playing war zone tomorrow i doubt
it i don't know we might be playing
siege tomorrow
i downloaded it yesterday malph said
they needed a fifth
and then i downloaded it and by the time
it finished downloading
my man was playing isaac again i mean if
that doesn't tell you about the quality
of
repentance and i don't know what will
man
i don't know how to interact with this
room
[Laughter]
let's let's get some consumables in a
over the rest of the floor and then
we'll talk about it we'll try to figure
it out together
how did i not take a hit there oh my god
oh my god
a triple item room i'm starting to think
it might even
be a triple item
okay yeah yeah
it could be well i don't even know what
i'd be looking for at a blank rune right
now so i think we'll just okay
control space it's alges dude
that's that's pog still you know we
gotta dodge because we have to dodge
with
esau but that minimizes our chances
of of running into trouble here
just keep them as as synced as they can
get
because this would be a sick time to get
a deal with the devil
we could use a little damage injection
nice that the boss just took a couple
minutes off there
uh okay more hp belongs to
esau just be just be cool here eson's
gonna need that
no krampus i mean we gotta take mega
they probably
changed it is my guess but we gotta try
it
at least and then you hit how do you hit
q
q uses mega i think
you know what i'm willing to i'm willing
to sack
half a spirit heart for that
this is tough for me because uh
i don't know what fortune cookie does
um i don't know one bomb for five bombs
is pretty sick
you know what i'm gonna do it's good
it's good
it reads your fortune oh hi mock
here's what i'm thinking okay jedi would
not teach you this
we're just chilling just give me just
check this out the man's a genius
and two bomb synergies baby now we're
talking
that being said i'm not going to the to
the alt floor
i refuse to go to the alt floor because
that's that's not what we're doing on
this
run we don't have the damage necessary
to go to the alt
floor wait a minute the item the fortune
cookie's still in there
exqueeze me princess
okay we'll go we'll go check it
first give me that 9 volt
more curse rooms is an interesting what
an interesting dilemma and choice we
have here
um i don't have any keys anymore yeah
that's right
but then again there is a key back here
one moment please
in fact there's two keys that are easily
accessible would you look at that
you know what it happens
we'll use one more bomb to get one more
key still it's still an acceptable trade
where my believers at you pay them up
you pay em
up believers hey believers
pay you gotta give them channel points
today
you gotta give them channel points to
day
you you pay him up you pay him out
believe
you don't like that one i i came up with
a with a good one today
um it was off the top of the dome piece
when the baby was fussing in an isaac
episode
um pog i i
i said to the tune of kendrick lamar's
b-word don't kill my vibe
i am a baby who's probably going to cry
again
mom forgive me the things i don't
understand
sometimes i need to pee a lot
please don't put me down please don't
put me down
i can summon mom and dad from 10 houses
away
i got my milk i got my mobile i could
share it but today i'm saying please
don't put me down
not not no not in a veterinary sense
just in like pick up
put down pick up put down
okay hold on
okay there's a tinted rock in here
everyone just chill
of course the believer song was better
it's it was better because it's
easier the song is already called
believer
you know i'll take it i don't mind speed
up tears down
she's a certified 20 but that just ain't
me
fortune cookie reusable fortunes
what did do what do you want to do today
what do you want to do today you know
what
let's keep it rolling like i don't know
what it actually does
but let's keep it rolling temporarily
just because it's new
and we'll get rid of mega just i know i
know people are not going to be pleased
about getting rid of mega but like
it's a new item let's give it a try
question mark question mark question
mark come on we don't we use our words
here
it's like one of the things i think i've
i've made a we've instituted a wide
sweeping rule lately
um if if i say something that literally
does not make coherent sense
and people go you know what the heck is
he talking about that's a valid question
mark situation
uh-oh but if people just disagree and
they spam
10 question marks that's actually that's
just toxic you're just being mean
and you know how we feel about meanies
here i picked them up over my head
easily and then
whether they get placed down nicely or
not nicely depends on the level of
contrition that they have
from the point of lifting
hey that's just rude i mean it's comedic
timing timing comedic timing
let's go with the guarantee
trying to remember you know honestly the
boss is not that tough here
i feel like we could probably
i feel like we could probably take the
boss on this one i'm more scared of the
rooms than the boss although now that i
think about it being
jacob and esau like any dodge is really
tough to do
actually you know it's harder to be
guaranteed that you're gonna come out of
it
you know smelling like a rose mega would
be good against the boss
that's a great impression of what
somebody bad at isaac would say in order
to you know try to get to their first
win of all time
okay that's that hurts i'm dead
all right mega probably would have been
helpful there
boom roasted
all right try again what was that was
only like that was 20 minutes
that's funny you got to give comedic
timing a chance to breathe
turns out mega would have been sick
i'm not trying to blame chat necessarily
all i'm gonna say is that if i had if i
had marched the beat of my own drum
and ignored the fortune teller we
wouldn't have been in that mess in the
first place
i would just be i'd be pogging out of my
gourd
instead people were like nah you gotta
pick up the fortune teller
and then when i picked up the fortune
teller they're like you gotta put it
back down and i was like look
this is not one of those new uh fangled
uh
zoomer uh social networks where you get
to like
vote on how i live my life like this is
i much the beat of my own drum i was
born in the pre-smartphone era
i can hold my own thing when i go to the
bathroom
i'm not too worried about it
i'm not used to these eu friendly
streams
i mean we've been doing them for like
like almost more than three months now
i think you should get used to him okay
orbital does not matter
spirit heart probably doesn't matter too
much
i like my man's arms though that's
pretty cool
oh because of the time zone change that
yeah that makes sense
dude i'm very hopeful that i mean i
think that the government here said that
they were not gonna do this but i hope
that as usual they're lying
um and they actually end up like
uh making this the last year of of
daylight savings
okay hold on hold on okay you ready you
ready
bottoms up down the hatch control
control q control space
that dude unity
that one's for me though
[Laughter]
um well we can't go to the old floor so
that's one way to do it
he loves it
yeah dude like
it's crazy like
well not every year but like this
government ran on that as one of their
campaign promises
uh when they were originally elected in
2015
or 20 2017 now that i think about it um
like it's not
that major like
like daylight savings is not an enormous
policy decision like it doesn't really
dictate your quality of life but at the
same time
it's not so bad i'm like because it's
such a minor
policy decision why don't you just like
do it
[Laughter]
i don't know like that's the i was gonna
say that's the problem with democracy
but like you know what i mean
it's like if the government just had
some more executive power they could
have pushed that stuff through
like easily instead of going through all
this dialogue
then again they could probably use those
powers to push through some some stuff
that's a little less poggy
one might say on the other hand
you gotta admit things would get done
like with that
spring forward i don't think so tim
the average bureaucracy enjoyer
i know what you're talking about i
follow the memes
now it look i'm just gonna be real
i don't think blue map is like 10 out of
10 but the flip side of that
is i love knowing to some degree
where i'm going oh that's pretty sick i
love knowing to some degree where i'm
going
because uh i mean i i was doing a run
today
and and kate came into my office to pick
up the baby
i just showed her the size of the map
like it was the mausoleum
uh and it was an xl floor
and i was just boggled at the size of
the map like
i i it's it's so long as to just
make me want to end the run basically
like
it was probably like 50 rooms it was as
long as the
the void floor yeah it became became a
jrpg
i had to stop by uh you know cloud city
in order to pick up sid
runs do last way longer that's why i'm
laughing at dan
doing a one-minute poll in every item
room to to figure out what chat wants
him to take i am a fool by the way
um i'm like dude if you keep doing that
like your runs are gonna be they're
going to be uh
infinite length control q
control space hey that's good control
no look at this
balance control space control q
control space he's learning man he's
learning
look at that look at that
okay we're ready to go dude we're
actually gonna get a deal with the devil
too which is pretty sick
i hope it has something good like the
fortune cookie
yeah we got like i forget what it's
called we got
we got poop lover
[Laughter]
so uh it doesn't really matter who takes
this
oh it well it kind of matters i guess um
dirty mind thank you the average
brimstone
taker
and then also the average betrayal taker
who people have told me this item is
like a little better now
okay now i said we weren't gonna take
the alt path all right
that was before we got essentially
infinite bombs
and then also like the greatest item of
all time
brimstone which has been slightly nerfed
but
uh or maybe more than slightly nerfed
but that's okay like
i mean it's still it's still amazing
protect those rainbow poops maybe i will
maybe i won't you know
the important part is i'm trying to talk
to you guys about air fryers but you
won't
shut up okay
let's just this is an air fryer channel
now
shoop the whoop should be on let's let's
put it on non-brim marty
i i don't know what i'm doing my but the
poops are scrambling my brain
yo yum hard on the character that
actually has uh
hp as well what a happy accident
that's some good stuff
i miss when we were anti-jaywalking uh
well i'm still pretty anti-jaywalking
but i'm not anti-jaywalking because i
like hate pedestrians
i'm i'm anti-jaywalking
because i believe that society is at its
best
when everybody follows the rules
and you know what everybody's gonna do
especially when
there's like large potentially lethal
vehicles involved
so you know we got we got the system
going on with the lights
the lights do a pretty good job of
telling people uh
you know when they should go and when
they shouldn't i think that there's some
pedestrians out there who go
uh hey the light is like an inhibitor
for me
no the light is is not just trying to
keep you down
the light is also you know making sure
that you don't you have the lowest
chance possible
at least let's say to get you know hit
by a ford f-150 or a dodge ram
winner of motor trends truck of the year
a record three times in a row
what if there were no cars though yeah
what if uh
what if there were no cars what what if
god came down from heaven and just gave
everybody infinite lembus bread
you know we're we're living in a world
of realities right now
not a you know the pipe dreams of your
average discord enjoyer okay hold on
hold on
this room with two players is almost
impossible
you need to have a phd per character
oh you meant you'd you meant there's no
cars at the moment
well that's like if uh essentially
it's a perfect crime if a tree falls in
the forest and nobody's around to hear
it
the tree did not fall similarly
if you jaywalk but there's no cars it's
not jaywalking it's just called
walking genius play
oh
and this is no wonder these runs take so
long man
look at all the advantages they've given
me advantages on my legs and my arms for
you
advantages advantages advantages have
advantages you know hot hot heat
no they were pretty popular for for a
little bit
they're a canadian band
i think that this is probably the best
way to play it
okay and then we got to go get the the
the knife piece no problem
all right
you seem in a very good mood today hope
you had a have a nice
sunday it was a good uh good weekend a
good weekend
a good week and a good weekend
saved
i'm scared i don't even want to go over
it
don't go into the mirror boss excuse me
i have to get the alt path
we will go into the mirror and we will
use jacob
jacob touches it jacob touches it and
then we will immediately go back
please shoot the poops look you gotta
you gotta pick your battles right
i'm probably not gonna shoot every poop
because we got banter
we got gameplay we got two characters
simultaneously
can i ask you a question
why am i still the lost did i not go
through the mirror
it will go away
you have to kill the boss to not become
the lost you have to beat a room with
enemies in it
oh we're back we're back oh my god
that's a rule that i've never heard of
you have to defeat the
the you have to kill a room with enemies
to break the curse of the lost
that's news to me man
might be a bug you never know whatever
we we saved it
easily i might add um i just wanna
think for a second about
what i gotta do and i shouldn't
do that but i did it anyway let's do
it again get the golden chest
then in the end it was worth
the price that we paid
mom where's my
gucci sandwich you promised me
a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch
it's 11 22. that's considered
lunch in the most part of the world
sorry sometimes i just get the
it's called inspiration
i was just temporarily inspired there
you good mate is just the kind of stuff
that goes through your mind when you
realize you're gonna be playing the same
game for like four hours
is like we might as well just you know
occasionally
let's just send it man it's just like
take a lark
that's a good point i forgot about
yamaha thank you
what do you think this is control q oh
baby
oh yeah that's my triple collateral on
free-for-all
let's be real like brimstone marty is
gonna do 99 of the damage here
so we are going to give him 99 of the hp
or of the uh of the damage i should say
much to the chagrin of bernie sanders
who i might add is very upset
that 50 of the characters get 100 of the
damage upgrades
does this seem fair to you etc etc
by the way i forgot to say happy easter
everybody marry easter
an especially happy easter goes out to
all the delivery drivers out there
who place the deliveries
far enough away from my door that i
don't have to push the
the boxes over when i open the door when
i'm trying to get the boxes
a special happy easter
to those particularly astute delivery
drivers
much appreciated
you're welcome i appreciate it thank you
thank you
hey hey hey yo you stay down there
jacob touches it
we have meat cleaver and an unknown item
um i don't know what meat cleaver does
so we're gonna pick it up on brimstone
maybe it's like an enormous damage
upgrade
i have no idea
let's see let's see
it cleaves meat
gone and done it again y'all it it
turns enemies into smaller versions of
themselves much like
its namesake okay
in that case uh we'll be taking yom
heart i think and and moving on with our
lives
back at it again the krispy kreme i'm
just saying if we're talking top vines
ever
back at it again at the krispy kreme is
is up there
like it's way up there
maybe not number one but certainly it
makes it to the sweet 16.
top five no doubt
[Laughter]
x games mode x games mode is good
i do i really do like is this allowed as
well
excuse me are you are you a rock tinted
i can't tell
i ca i don't think you are i think
you're just the normal but i i
it's very hard to tell it is
you sure all right
i mean you were right but at what cost
oh gb bug is like a he's a shooter now
many battery charges okay
let me in thank you thank you just a lot
of things to like you know
pay attention to at this point on this
run
one thing and it's probably gonna happen
like when you get a little bit more
muscle memory in uh
repentance but like for now
i have not had an autopilot run
unless i've just decided that i'm going
to lose and then you can say whatever
you want because it doesn't matter
anyway but
thoughts on the band wean
i'll i'll level with you i literally
only know
ocean man and then also they had like
some songs on
chef aid the south park album
that i i listened to religiously when i
was about 10 years old
uh so i i don't think i'm the right man
for the job i guess is what i'm trying
to say get me out of here i'm
saved i'm saved i'm dead that
come on that's just mean spirited man
so you'll take this and then we'll go
we need we need some spirit hearts for
esau man
you know what there's one way to check
there was converter but i think we're i
think we're out
i think we're out
converters pog now
rotten heart this is like who cares
[Laughter]
you gave up uh three flies
okay there we go now we're talking
almond milk though at least it's not on
the brimstone character that could have
been a
that could have been a trick
i am stunned like i don't know like i i
i thought i was immune to isaac
backseating just due to like uh
the amount that i played i guess the
i've just got to acknowledge that
it's gonna happen no matter what but
like if you behave like that in like
cobalt there's invictus chad
like don't you just get banned instantly
like maybe it's time to start taking a
lesson from them
yes okay yeah see like this
like this is like the one game like i
know exactly
what i'm doing well not exactly but you
know i
i have a good understanding of what i'm
doing
it's the one game where i should be
immune to the backseating in in my
opinion
instead people are like you left behind
a rotten heart it's not even like an
extra heart it's just a couple of flies
man
okay we have a little baby situation
coming up hello baby
it's a mom situation
yeah i i recognize that from when she
was in my office for a couple hours this
morning
i do hear that she goes over and over
i do okay i see the the knock on effect
of
of what happens here she gets
distracted by chet
and
you do what you got to do nobody puts
baby in the corner though
hey baby you gotta you gotta eat for
mommy okay
hold on jacob touches it jacob touches
it
she does look like she has a gamer chair
huh
she's got her very own uh dx racer
you knew that was ah sorry i
i don't want to scare the baby but it's
kind of hard because there's some
moments of startle okay i i'm i'm very
low on hp
i i'm sure with jacob here so just chill
thank you esau for taking the hit
you know i'm glad to hear it
just go just go
okay i can't believe esau is just eating
it man go go go
i gotta get the key
it is a lot harder with jacob and esau
like this is
it's it's a bit of a task holy crap we
lived
no idea what our hp is like right now
but we did survive
at least temporarily and we got this
cool little knife now how about that
freaking sexy mom's knife man
he's doing it he's doing it this time
we'll get the rotten hard no doubt about
that
i did uh i did not see the post of on
the subreddit of well no okay i know
what you're talking about
are you talking about the post of on the
subreddit of
our baby wearing the lion merch or are
you talking about
a post that i did not see but can like
reverse engineer which is
the rapper the baby
wearing the merch which i imagine could
have been posted on a circle jerk
i don't really like you know i'm very
supportive of the memes
i don't really get the the baby meme
like i get that he's a rapper and he he
points to his head and says
let's go but i don't really understand
like
on the list of like the power rankings
of memes
is very low
i hate that you have uh a holy mantle
right now that seems scary to me
like it it's about as funny to me as
like do you know the way
or something like that like it's a very
i i give it a limited amount of uh
of my respect right now
okay we've unlocked brimstone bombs
speed does not matter although we did
get damage on
jacob so we should do that because then
we we got spun
very tricky run right now because we
don't know what our hp looks like
i think we take nothing
i hate to say it i feel like we take
nothing
yeah we need hp to open the door we
gotta
you know it's not cowardice you know
like
there's not you don't get any special
prizes for taking an item and then dying
two seconds later
i will
i will play the potato peeler one time
i will get a spirit heart on the
character most likely to die
i'll leave him i'll even buy this card
chariot see there's something there
chariot unfortunately does not work
pardon me with the door i wish it did
but it doesn't
this is handween okay don't don't step
on that then you gotta take
uh you gotta take
esau he does have some invincibility as
well
it does now i i feel like i'm being
trolled because i did that like
literally earlier today and it didn't
work
[Laughter]
i feel i feel like i'm in troll city
what howard
he's so low i thought he was the one
with the most hp
okay sorry just just stay cool here
that's very nice
i don't really mind that it's not on uh
brimstone marty we'll live with that
really just trying to stay alive
comical it's comical all right so i
think i've got the right play you know
slash marker uh alt path
failure and then we're gonna just try to
mainline the dark path i i don't think
you can do
jacob and esau alt path reliably unless
you have uh
some form of like hp and hp regeneration



all right we're gonna try uh jacob and
esau again but we're not gonna get
goaded into uh taking the
the alt path it's it's a fool's errand
you gotta do it at some point but it's
not an
it's not an all-time uh or every time
sort of thing
so now and then it's just sometimes food
mom's contact we'll put it on strong
unit for now
nl has gone off the bubbly false i was
drinking a bubbly literally was probably
what
inspired you to say he's gone off the
bubbly
was drinking this can that is bubbly
mere seconds ago
that's right it's the square path
you know where the triangle
shape goes
the triangle hole that's right
it's the square hole
you can tell i'm on the bubbly because i
got a little carbon dioxide
it has to be done
not that you've gone off it that you're
gone
off of it ah
okay
i used to this is not me this is chad i
used to date this girl who said flat
water is for poor people as she drank
her fifth
lacroix honestly it sounds like you have
kind of like
a dubious taste in women my friend i i
don't know
like i think that was supposed to be a
joke uh like
that was gonna be a dunk on
uh sparkling water consumers instead it
just calls into question you're tasting
romantic partners
it makes it makes it seem like you
should be more selective quite frankly
oh my god dude i didn't know that we had
emo modification
on the bunny ears
yeah wait did she work for the pepsi
corporation because if so
we got to get in touch okay
hp hp for you and then we take the
coward's way out we just go straight
down
it's a little uh
i mean it's more than a little rude
[Laughter]
to suggest that flat water there's a lot
of reasons you would drink flat water
you're out of sparkling water for one
you've already had too much sparkling
water
for two
those those are two big ones when you're
really thirsty you don't want to drink
sparkling water like you don't want to
go for like a uh
a long jog and then drink two liters of
lacroix like that's
that's a recipe for feeling pretty bad
in your abdomen for sure
if you want to chug something you don't
you don't chug sparkling water you savor
it
it's a bit of a slap in the face but
that's fine
i don't think i've ever had a sparkling
water i've enjoyed i think it's like
um here and this might not be the case
but this is my hunch okay this is a good
faith
uh sentiment i don't mean to try to own
somebody
i feel like if your main comparison
is sparkling water to either
juice or soda
sparkling water can't compete with the
sweetness no doubt
if your comparison is sparkling water to
to flat water then i think it's a lot
easier to appreciate
but i don't think that's that's the
truth for everybody
i like them both you know i mean that
you're i'm getting pushed like and this
is the danger i think you know we end up
in society when we disagree we end up
being so polarized now you know
like you can't just be like i prefer
this i don't like this instead it's got
to be like anybody who like the average
sparkling water enjoyer etc etc like
like
exactly what i've done um i like them
both don't get me wrong
like this
i'm just like it's the same as the air
fryer i'm like i don't know why
you know if i was like hey you shouldn't
smoke people would be like hey man let
people live
their lives times are tough blah blah
blah um
you know you don't know what i've been
through if you're like i'm enjoying a
can of sparkling water people are like
it tastes like
uh it tastes like the shavings from an
electric razor
it tastes like i'm drinking like a
copper wire
it's like they they they've shorted the
sparkling water stocks or something we
got a bunch of melvin capitals
i don't know it's just it's the same as
the air fryer
you could i had the best crispy chicken
wings in the air fryer last night people
will be in chat like
now you didn't i don't understand it man
okay just just hang back just hang back
no i've never had a white claw post
pandemic if i get invited to like
somebody's barbecue or something
i think i would try one for sure i mean
it's hard seltzer right
i bet i would probably enjoy it
i'm not gonna go to the curse room just
take me down here
it's very good is good i love them
they're pretty good
i mean that's the thing i i don't i mean
maybe it's hard to say
like i can't say that i anything popular
can't be bad but like i feel like
white claw and like neutral vodka soda
and stuff like that up here they've sold
so
much in such a short frame frame of time
is that even a time frame such a short
span of time there we go
that i'm like there's gotta be something
to it
like i mean bud light lime was really
popular as well i think it's like a
trash
uh beer for sure but like when i had my
first bud light lime i was like i can
totally understand why people
you know drink this it tastes like a
tortilla chip
okay i'd give it a shot for sure
pbr is better i mean so you know at that
point we're like really would you rather
like you know
you know lick the lid of the trash can
or like lick someone's pocket limp or
something like that
you know there's do it's different
strokes for different folks
if you're at a barbecue you know you're
in the hot summer sun or something like
that
no no reason to get picky
you're gonna show up to like the fourth
of july barbecue with a bunch of like
nitro milk stouts and stuff like that
a 30 rack of pliny the elder and be like
hey you guys want to have like
one and a half triple ipas and then fall
asleep
no man i want to like stay coherent and
like you know talk to my aunt about her
like mlm business or something like that
you know
it's it's called family sweetheart la
familia
does it matter i think
it's about la familia
i'm just hopeful we get like a half of
the goodness that we had on our last run
that's what's burning me up like a jonas
brothers song if we had just done
the like if we if we held our hubris in
check we would have won the last run on
the dark path easily
i think i did ask for half the items
and would you look at that
no i don't think there's any way to
start uh an mlm
in king of retail but i wouldn't be
surprised so there's this company and
and i don't even mean it in a negative
way
they literally release um
like a game a week and they're called
playway
it's a it's a polish publisher on steam
uh
they release every simulator game you've
ever seen cooking simulator car mechanic
simulator
you know blah blah blah mech mechanic
simulator they make them all
um i wouldn't be surprised if
if play way comes out with like an mlm
simulator
within i would say 18 months
like they're just the right company for
it i think they produce these games
in record time and then you know
i mean i wouldn't call it shovelware
because like some of them are
are actually like pretty good okay i
i don't think we could take this i don't
even know who i've given hp to at this
point but it is what it is
um no not because like mlms are a thing
in poland but like
uh just because like they have
every other simulator including some
like you know
dubious ones you know like cartel
simulator
you know drug dealer simulator etc etc
i'm waiting for twitch streamer
simulator it's been out for like
for years
yeah they made a house flipper they also
made the tenants i think i think the
tenants is a playway joint
there's a huge degree of variety right
like
in in the in the quality of the the
games but
yeah like polish simulators i feel like
it's mostly just play away but
polish simulators are like we're gonna
you know you you wanna
be a man who lives in a bunker we'll
make that game for you in three months
german simulators are like oh you wanna
like you know drive a bus
talk to us in eight years we're working
on it
two different strokes for different
folks
take me down here
they're not all garbage no like some of
them are not very good
i'll just be honest in fact i would
probably say
most of them the the main reason you
would play
is just for uh like maybe you for
whatever reason you've always wanted to
be like
i've always wanted to run a cotton candy
stand or something like that
um but i think that
some of them end up being pretty good
cooking simulator was
i mean house flipper people love um
cooking simulator
uh was a lot of fun
tenants seems pretty good i've i've got
a couple of
i've started using the oh geez
started using the wishlist feature on
steam i have a lot of
uh playway stuff on my wishlist not
joking because it's stuff that i think
would be great for stream
like i think there's one coming out
called like you are the lawyer or
something like that
and i was like i gotta try that when it
comes out that's gonna be like
that's gonna be a dream come true
okay
oh don't even get me started on on
fighting not fighting
farming simulator but really isn't
farming just fighting
um hunger
if you if you really think about it
can we talk about how much tenant sucked
uh no because i haven't seen it yet i'm
still waiting for it to come out in a
free context because everybody told me
it was not worth paying for
[Laughter]
they have a pope game coming out let's
go
it's not bad it's just not good i'll
give it a try i mean like
at this point i i really i just can't
pay for a movie
i have amazon prime disney plus and
netflix like
if i ever pay for a movie like i'm
running a deficit
that's true i have hbo as well dude like
i literally like if i ever pay for a
movie it cost me like
200
by the way and and i know i talked about
this on
on friday i actually did finally
finish an episode of marriage or
mortgage on netflix
the show where uh couples have a budget
and then they pit
a wedding planner against a real estate
agent
to see whether they'll they'll rather
have their dream wedding or move into a
house
um and i have to tell you it's actually
like
accidentally one of the funniest shows
of all time
because in the first episode it's like
you know almost an hour
long and they go through uh you know
like
planning the wedding and stuff like that
and then you know this is what you'll
get on your budget for this wedding and
they're like oh it's a dream come true
and then the uh for the house one they
were like
you know oh we found like this awesome
place and you know there's like a lot of
production went into it a ton of budget
etc etc
and then uh at the end of the episode
they're like we've chosen the dream
wedding
and then instantly like the camera
you know fades to black and then text
pops up on the screen that's like
due to covet 19 they were not able to
have their dream wedding anyway
so and i'm not laughing at the
couples it's just a funny situation
where like
they still i guess they'd put like a
deposit in on some of the stuff so they
rented like
like two trolleys that were gonna carry
80 people from the reception
or from the ceremony to the reception to
the blah blah
and then they were only able to have
like their parents there so like they
were like my mom and dad really loved
the private trolley that they got and i
was like oh
this just that's just tough
you hate to see it and then i was also
thinking and this is like
not the angle that obviously anybody
wants to
tackle it from but i was also like man
you know not only did your wedding get
screwed up but
uh like home prices rose so much you
probably cost yourself like
20 extra uh when you do eventually
choose to buy into the market like you
got
i feel bad for you you really just got
like insanely screwed
is what it comes down to
sucks pretty bad do you think you get
your money's worth out of those
subscriptions uh well here's the thing
for a long time netflix was like a
no-brainer
and maybe we should have done esau there
but um netflix was a no-brainer for a
long time
now lately i have not gotten my money's
worth out of netflix but i'm you know
i mean just being honest like i'm i'm
not gonna cancel it because like i just
enjoy being able to have it up and
eventually i have faith some netflix
original will come out that i'll be
happy to have um
disney plus i've been getting more than
my money's worth
recently not just the the marvel stuff
but also like i watched big trouble in
little china yesterday like they they've
got a
if you think it's just marvel stuff
they've got a pretty huge
lineup of uh of uh
shows and movies from you know the the
three trillion businesses that dizzy
has uh has acquired over the course of
the past few years
um amazon prime video like literally we
just have it because of
amazon prime so i'm not really too
worried about that one either way we're
getting our money's worth out of that
yeah that's true they do it disney plus
has the simpsons on it
how about that and then hbo
hbo varies but i do like my the first
place i look when i turn on my tv in the
afternoon
is uh is the movie channels
but unfortunately i know how this sounds
but i think we kind of get screwed uh
in canada on hbo and the movie channels
due to
the can con law where you have to play
like
uh you know 10 canadian content or
something like that i don't exactly know
how it applies
but i feel like crave which is like our
hbo analog
does so many like bad canadian movies
it sucks i wish that they were better
so they didn't have to sell out my my
country
and there are some good canadian films
you know guy madden makes some good
stuff
technically i suppose the resident evil
films are uh
are canadian as well
we're not doing all path but like it's
it's just like
i got hbo i want them to play
good stuff but instead like it's some
canadian student film like 70
of the time i'm like this isn't worth 20
bucks a month
they just put the nanny on hbo mr
sheffield
sorry
but that i i can't believe i remember
what the name of the
the family from the nanny was dude
that's scaring me
i had no clue that that knowledge was up
there
it's such a such a strange comment that
also made me laugh
this is from chat um
i'd have given fran drescher a baby you
know just uh
so kind of the fran like it they mean it
as a joke if you're watching don't
don't read that and and get creeped out
even though it is creepy
[Laughter]
i promise you they mean it as a
compliment okay it's it's hard to tell
in the moment but
i love the hassan emo like what is it
it's always like okay so here's what i
know about hassan right
he's a political streamer who also plays
a lot of
grand theft auto i'm in his chat on
occasion and it's a lot of fun because i
believe
i've been made a vip and his chat is in
emote only like 25
of the time so sometimes i just come in
there
and like just flex the fact that i can
talk which is a lot of fun
everybody else is just spamming emotes
and i'm i'm able to type things
that's that's a good time okay
definitely do not go there
um then i also
occasionally on twitter i will see that
hassan has liked the tweet that could be
described by the younger generation as
being a thirst
trap okay don't take any dumb damage
here
uh and then anytime that happens
the replies to the tweet are just
hundreds of people
using that has mods emote
oh no dude
so that's that's literally like i don't
i i've diagnosed enough to know what i'm
looking at
but i don't understand the the
implications of it
what is a thirst trap again this is like
secondhand knowledge my understanding of
a thirst trap
is when basically somebody posts uh
a freaking sexy selfie
designed to attract compliments and
thirst i.e uh sexual attraction
that's the way i understand it at least
okay you you don't have an orbital jacob
jacob touches it
that's what shibley told me anyway
does this have anything to do with down
bad yeah i don't know i think
down bad is like um and again this is
just from
what i can infer i believe that down
bad is a is a synonym for being horny
but but it also has like an air of it's
not just like you're a horn dog it's
that you're also like desperate
like you're horny and lonely
[Laughter]
or something along those lines am i am i
doing okay by the
zoomer social media terminology right
now
i'd say so let's go the baby let's go
every card in this game is the tower
just for the record
really leaning into the boomer energy
just like just shut up
it's just like a
anime meme of guy looking at butterfly
uh
you know referencing anything that
happened before the year 2018
is this a boomer
oh my god we've made it to the door
okay sneak in you will not hit me
i told you i told you i told you
it's a simple question are you supposed
to be able to dodge is this character
no okay fair enough that's all i could
ask
hold on hold on yeah yeah yeah
check this out check this out
he's so good officially he's so good
sometimes you just gotta use your brain
okay try again i'll take it i'll tell
you no no as you jacob doesn't touch it
oh he's so close to the edge dude
i'm so like literally just walked over
it
i after this i got to do like a a cane
run man like my brain is so freaking
destroyed
he uses i i'm gonna say it uses
30 more calories
to play as jacob and esau do blue fires
suck
now i mean i think much like a lot of
things in this game
they've been nerfed a little bit for
sure
or a lot maybe
it's a good idea chad wait what
wait what um
do we care for this i don't know book of
sin could keep us alive
eric i'm i'm begging you man just chill
out just just relax
i think i'm happy with book of sin
keeping us alive here
i don't know this is this is the time to
commit it's the time to use a a little
bit more energy
hopefully set ourselves up reasonably
well for the rest of the game because
this run could only be like halfway over
oh man okay
um it's not it's not that impressive but
oh you know what that's a good point you
could probably hit two skulls
simultaneously while gambling now i
didn't even consider that
apparently it's a 10 chance for uh
for the blue fires to pay out now i
wanna play the demon judgment but i
think we gotta just like
get hit because we have no control over
that um but i think we gotta
uh get some red hearts first like hp is
very precious here
as it always is yeah this this would be
the last jacob and he saw
i also did one this morning so i'm like
i'm getting a little burned out on this
but
we'll play as a an easier character next
time yeah
hold on i'll try to use get out of jail
on the door as well
it's all in the interest of testing
you're the door you're the door are you
the door
this is bethany
you're the door get out of jail free
it made a key sound it did not open
cross that off the list
one more data point
alt path keeper run you know we may not
just chill out for a minute all right we
got uh
something something billion dollar
stakes single byte are these
these are rocket shots right
i haven't played as the keeper since the
the changes so i actually should because
he's got three hp now and like i think
deals with the devil are uh
you can spend money on them instead of
spending hp like i feel like he's pretty
sick now maybe
maybe we will just you know win first
try as the keeper
every time i've had this item i've
accidentally killed myself
well you know we could use a
an excuse maybe it would be for the best
so i'm not sure if this runs got the
legs i need right now
why not just do it just yeah what's the
worst that could happen
okay just so we're looking for more
curse rooms
hmm
tinted skull was there a tinted skull
there was a tinted skull okay
now i understand all right
you're right it is a little spicy
um when you use bombs just stand still
but i'm like i okay hold on
it what
i don't know what's happening
put me in i'm ready we went to
everything
don't walk in the mom
that's one by the way so this is maybe
this is not becoming of a streamer
but i saw literally like the same people
who were like i'm not gonna spoil
anything
we're like for the first time ever they
were like don't forget the full card
wink wink don't forget the full card
he doesn't know lol forehead and i said
you know what
we will uh we'll hold that for a future
video then
i feel like that's an ill-gotten game
okay keep it moving he doesn't know hey
for no reason whatsoever would you
consider
taking the full card here
we're gonna do some new stuff you know
we got to do it as jacob and esau i'm
sure at some point anyway but
this run just getting like the slightest
bit of actual momentum would help out a
lot
getting some positive feelings
i feel like this run is kind of a
doo-doo but on the bright side we do
have a 1 in 250 chance of getting a deal
with the devil
that could really spin it around here
never tell me the odds
i want you to get it who gets what
doesn't matter
but we might as well take both because
we want to go
dark path probably yeah okay i think we
want to go dark path
yeah yeah yeah
help did they fix kerstein i've had
cursed eye a couple times
i mean i feel like this adds a little
too much chaos into this run but
i mean i just want just trying to coast
till the end i'll probably walk into it
uh
by accident anyway it's buffed but it
still sucks
yeah i still don't get curse of the
tower either like curse of the tower
i don't know if it's just the meme or
there's some meat and potatoes to it but
people are like it's better now
doesn't it do the exact same thing
i've i've never noticed obama's home on
enemies now
control q please thank you
that changes everything man oh no
and they do a lot more damage
it's still bad for the player but it's
better at killing enemies
i mean it's something but
still not worth taking i'm trying really
hard not to just slip into the chat
trap of like anytime anything is buffed
it must be good now and anytime
anything's nerfed it must be bad now
i've been seeing that a lot
pop up please pop up please i'd like to
i'd like to hit you and not be killed
can i
could you pop up please
i'm dead it's it's impossible it's a
hell room
well slash marker next



back at it again at the krispy kreme um
didn't the divergent movies die like
they uh
they were gonna make like
three of them and then the first one did
so badly they didn't even make the
second
something like that
they turned it into a tv movie
hold r you've been watching too many
other streamers honestly
you need to insulate yourselves you know
like
for the difficult lives that lie ahead
of you if you face strife
you know you can't hold our irl
you gotta you gotta pull yourself out
you know if a mouse gets stuck in a
bucket of cream
you can either drown or you can
move your little legs so fast you turn
the butter into cream and climb out
exactly one bite at a time
i know that that's a it's a catch me if
you can quote but i don't know it from
catch me if you can i know it from mouth
quoting uh catch me if you can
catch me if you can was about me i don't
think so
i don't think your name is frank
abagnale or whoever tom hanks played in
that movie
what do you say when you get a strike in
bowling
is this is there a real punch line to
this one i don't know
who you could say who do you think you
are i am usually like
it's such a common occurrence for me
that i try not to draw too much
attention to it
i just go like like a nice little fist
pump you know
no i do not say st reich that's
classless
that'll get you kicked out of the lucky
lanes
no no no
have you ever injured yourself while
bowling you get a bruise on your ankle
sometimes that's about it
like or you maybe sometimes like your
thumb gets a little
jammed when you're when it comes out of
the ball
but you get it like an ankle bruise like
depending on the way that your
uh your gait is in advance of your shot
oh come on
you hit the ball against your ankle as
you release and you get a little bruise
there
it happens who does that
i'm i mean like you're asking the
authority then when the authorities like
this what
happens you're like based on my
inexperience i doubt it
i play i was in a bowling league because
i i was like
mr popular uh as a as a small child as
an adolescent i played in a bowling
league
people are bruising their their ankles
left right and center
deep lord what was your average i can't
remember honestly but like i think my
highest
bold game ever was like a 2 220
something or 230 something
never even came close to sniffing at a
uh
at a perfect game but had some some
solid ones for sure
don't don't explode into you're creating
too much i can't get out of the way
have you ever crapped in a bowling alley
bathroom
it's kind of a personal question um
you know it might sound ridiculous
considering i
you knew that was coming considering i
played in a league
but i honestly think the answer is
probably no
it's not possible man like um
it's uh i i really i wouldn't say i had
like a complex about it
but uh i really endeavored not to be
like a
a public uh pooper
i mean in in 10 years of school from
like junior kindergarten to eighth grade
i think i probably did a number two in
the school bathroom like
i would say less than ten times it was
definitely like less than once a year
it was only if there was like some kind
of emergency that i would
that i would do it otherwise i would i
would just hold it until i got home
i wonder if this will give us a deal
with the devil that's the keeper style
because we used it on this floor
could be interesting i did it like twice
from first to 12th grade i mean that's
i'm impressed honestly i i'm we had
different gut bacteria i guess
every once in a while i just found
myself in a position where there was no
choice
i do remember though like once i uh
in second grade i put up my hand to ask
to go to the bathroom
and then the teacher was like yes ryan
and i was like can i go take a poop
and she was like you don't have to say
that you can just say
may i go to the bathroom please
[Laughter]
it was a pretty good own in in my
opinion
one of the better owns oh at work i
i would poop as often as i could get
away with i mean it it sucks actually
like
okay oh stonks
legitimate stocks um
it sucks because like as a when i worked
in an
office you could absolutely
just poop you could probably take two
mid-length poops daily without anybody
even
noticing you know like you could take
you could you could poop 15 minutes a
day
nobody would would notice um
in fact they're probably happy to see
you gone let's let's save our
uh money to spend on a deal with the
devil on the next floor
seems very sensible to me um but when i
worked as a teacher
literally you just had to do like you
know you had six minutes between classes
and you had to share a bathroom
uh with the kids which was demoralizing
man
because they had like one adult stall
and then like one
kid's stall sometimes you'd end up
pooping
like next to your students and they'd be
like trying to have a conversation with
you on the toilet and you're like
like kevin i really didn't want you to
know that like your teacher's
poo smelled this bad like this is too
familiar
and like oh hold on i think i got a yeah
a headphone based issue
yeah it's messed up man like it's a bad
system
and then sometimes like the the really
young kids
you know they were like five years old
so their bathroom habits weren't that
good
they would like open the door while they
were pooping and be like can you help me
and of course you're gonna you're like
you know it's not in my job description
but you're like yeah what do you need
buddy but you're like
you know i don't get paid enough to like
have to
deal with this kid's toilet problems
there was also they they had like
support staff at the school that was
sometimes you'd be like uh
hannah teacher hannah teacher kevin has
a real problem going on here
yeah but then if you could hold it until
you got home that was the sweetest poop
didn't have to deal with any of that
nonsense
oh there were a lot of cabins kevin very
common like
esl name
yikes that is not what you're looking
for
how much did it cost to rent in south
korea that is uh is
it's an industry secret i
well it depends at least like my my
information is like outdated now right
like because this was 10 years ago uh
but
help me uh we the the school that i
worked at
gave you housing but it was like as
leverage to give you a smaller salary so
they they paid for your rent
but in return you made like
you know less money which is like
almost kind of like i mean criminal
i think but uh because i also think that
they happen to own the building which is
you know let's just put it this way like
when you're going into this job
like you know you're you're not going in
because you're like this is like a
you know an awesome career you're like i
don't know what i'm gonna do
after college so like let's just have
kind of like a year of
traveling that is also working and might
generate i'm dead
i'm alive might generate like some a
little extra cash you know
got him okay
i don't know i feel like bad phd could
be fun obviously we don't care about
book of belial
so this should be flies i think
i don't know maybe i don't know what i'm
talking about it's an interesting item
at least
zayn alert
big summer blowout i do like bad phd i
think it's
oh no
well it's still kind of stuck ah okay
whatever just let me out man
rude do i have a bomb i do have a bomb
were you able to accumulate money given
the salary
yeah i mean like straight up uh i mean i
i don't mind being open about it like
i think my my salary when i worked in
korea ended up being about
1700 bucks a month u.s which is
like pretty not good and you're working
a lot and you're working with kids which
usually you know you would hope had like
a little premium attached to it
um but they do
pay for your rents
so that cuts you could consider that
that maybe saves you like 30 percent
um
but for most people and and you don't
really pay tax on it either like
you end up being in the lowest income
bracket
and there's like a tax treaty between
south korea
and and canada and the us where like
you know you pay tax monthly but then
you get like a huge refund when you
leave
and then you pay tax in your home
country but
uh yeah it's it's not exactly like the
kind of salary where you're like i'm
gonna
be happy about dealing with a lot of bs
but most people do end up saving a lot
of money
you know food is cheap like just the
standard of living or the cost of living
is pretty cheap in south korea or at
least it was then
let's see what this does birthright does
something different is every character
right
i don't know so a lot of people like um
used it they did it for a couple of
years to like pay off
as much student loan debt as possible
that's more than i get for my phd
stipend
yo but that's like yo like you
but you're getting it like a phd
i was getting i don't i have nothing to
show for my
time there
you you're getting like uh well hold on
i didn't mean to all tab there but
you're kind of coming out uh on the
other side
you're you're gonna end up being the
person that
like sends the s downhill right
like once you got the phd
five years later you you've got like a
phd candidate working under you for
peanuts or something
that's the way i understand it at least
not really that's true i don't really
know what i'm talking about
what do you do and and this is not meant
to be negative at all
sincerely what do you do with a phd like
with an undergrad
you can't do anything for most look okay
there's some exceptions all right
computer science engineering et cetera
et cetera
with a masters you can do anything right
but then with a phd aren't you kind of
like gated into just becoming a
a professor
i i thought it was like the phd is just
like the it's the track into
professional academia not at all
as long as it beats me man
you see that dodge
when i went this is a true story i was a
good student in high school
when i went to university i had no idea
what the difference between a bachelor's
and a master's degree was
i honestly thought that uh
at first like i figured it out
eventually but
at first i thought that like a
bachelor's is what you get
like if you just get your degree but
don't do that well and then a phd or a
master's is what you get when you
do really well in school i thought it
was like the same time
investment but it was like the it's
based on how well you did
obviously that's not the case
i wish
having a phd would be pretty sick though
i would definitely
be one of those no i wouldn't but i'll
say that i am for the joke
i would list myself as a doctor even if
you know if my phd was not an md i would
still list myself as a doctor
100
that's dr lyon
you should though yeah but like you know
it's not you when they go like is there
a doctor on the plane they're not like
uh we needed uh please i uh yes okay i'm
uh
this is dr lyon um oh
help me this man collapsed on the plane
he doesn't know where he is and we don't
know what's wrong with him
all right um what's your favorite of
sophocles uh greek classics
sir what do you think about uh clinton
astra
oh yes i'm a doctor of uh of the
classics at the
university of phoenix online
there is a good bid there absolutely if
you were like
you know is there a doctor on board this
man's sick
okay tell me about your mother you know
they're like
they're a you know they're like a
psychiatrist or whatever
that'd be pretty funny that'd be a
pretty good joke
you're pretty good it's probably been
done right it's probably been done
i don't hate it i'll tease i don't even
know who clintum nestra is
she's she's from one of those she from
like saturnalia or
something like that
wait do i need two bombs am i stupid i'm
stupid
okay let's find we'll just get one here
anyway hold on
there's a stats up ah
ah it's agamemnon's wife that's right
bad trip gives us flies okay amnesia
let's not take it yet experimental pill
i don't know man
i'll take it lock down damage up speed
down damage up okay we let's not get too
ahead of ourselves but our damage is
looking pretty sick
0.66 speed is a little on the low side
do i have a bomb i do poggy
you know we could do two but no we need
those bombs that's right
[Laughter]
i was like we could get pandora's box to
give us
uh a speed upgrade
possibly what music have you been
listening to lately
uh it's a little known album called uh
the rational reminder podcast
uh discussions about five factor
portfolio management
starring ben felix and cameron passmore
analyst at pwl capital
you're absolutely right i should have i
should have taken this pill
that's my bad i i do like that there was
one person in
in the sea of resident sleepers that
said pog
i appreciate that thank you thank you
for your pogs
i appreciate it that's all i got i'll
just repeat it again a couple more times
i want to do this i don't really want to
do this
and now if you had to do any
professional job what would you choose
you didn't put within reason so i'm
gonna say ceo uh
i'm gonna say nhl all-star
no baseball but i want to be a
designated hitter
that's what do you think is the best
sport
if we're talking about maximum money
versus like money versus work but also
putting in
a little injury factor as well i kind of
believed in golf for the record until i
watched that tiger woods documentary and
found out that he like
absolutely destroyed his back somehow
like
i was like i i look i get that he's a
world-class
athlete but while i was watching the
documentary i was like bro how did you
screw up your back so bad
it's golf it's not you know you're in
the middle of golfing and like stone
cold steve austin comes over and throws
you through a folding
chair or something like that like
i'm like how'd you mess up your back so
bad in a sport that like
70 year olds play just because it gives
them the best chance to stay active
all right because i forgot he was uh he
trained to be a navy seal that's right i
actually genuinely just forgot about
that part where he
and yeah in the documentary they were
like and the navy seals would just like
kick the crap out
it's not funny but just
just just a little weird for sure just a
little strange
yeah there was a period where tiger
woods was like i'm gonna be a navy seal
i'm mad yes yes no please
i'm begging don't explode on that just
hit the boss dude thank you
you're the only thing i got that does
damage
natural seal progression or natural
career
profession golfer to navy seal no
here's you know what he did he did
golfer
to navy seal to golfer
he went uh he went back and forth like
like michael jordan
okay i mean this could be super valuable
look if i get a penny i'll probably buy
it we got keys
golden chests are good value we'd like
to become guppy we gotta give it a try
let's keep exploring i mean like we're
in this for the long haul
it's a heck of a trip i'm not taking the
pillow i'll take the pill when i leave
it's three flies everyone just freaking
chill out
all right we're we're staring down the
barrel right now
of possibly not getting a single win
today
we are doing like some of the i mean
obviously like the hardest challenges
but
also it's just kind of like it's a hard
game sneaks up on you
birthright makes wooden nickel
guaranteed to drop a coin
really i thought we didn't get a coin
drop when we started on the boss
but i might be a mistake it seems like
it's doing some crazy good
work for us on the percentages here okay
that just i didn't think my speed was
uh that bad but it is
i don't want to spend too much here
blow him up blow him up
money not funny
this is so risky but we're out here
okay i just gotta bake it into my brain
all right the right path to take
right right up and then all the way to
the left
oh baby right
right up
milk the blood bank
it's actually like a really good idea
at first i was like where did the coins
come from genius and then i was like ah
the blood bank oh yeah but as the keeper
the blood bank is not guaranteed to pay
out with coins
or at least it wasn't um
yeah where are the coins coming from
genius
i'm gonna take you to the bank senator
trent
to the blood bank
it's from a steven seagal movie i can't
remember what it's i
all i remember is it's not under siege
can i also tell you something
how the heck are we going to get into
the
special path here it's it's going to be
a challenge i'll tell you that
i guess we just uh
do it forehead just be built different
do you think hard mode is more difficult
now or am i just rusty
uh it's it's a lot more difficult now
i mean like empirically not not just
because there's new enemies but like
genuinely like that there have been
mathematical nerfs
the most deadly of all nerfs
it's easier to path with flight maybe
get the bible
it you know it's one of those things
where i i'm gonna choose to keep the
item that it gives the
okay that's a little what i was gonna
say is i'm gonna keep the item that
gives the keeper a chance to win
uh the wooden nickel but my brain does
that from time to time as well
it forgets about the fact that wooden
nickel is basically essential
and instead just goes like oh my god
it's so loud
let me in instead just goes like ah you
know what maybe we could try to take
something else
okay smart fly turns us into be alzab
look at that
now we got uh we got it all figured out
flying is good speed is grand
okay i need your help chat what on earth
is golden thing
members card pog what
okay what does it do no see in this in
this business i don't say take it
must buy i describe its effect to me
please
it gives you an extra shop in the shop
makes shop pog expensive
extra shop floor
okay so if i'm it unlocks the costco
floor
i don't know what this means makes it
you get a black market
every shop what okay
you know i i think it's one of those
things i'm just gonna have to pick up
and then
all right all right okay
let me see what's going on here we just
take it then you understand
so none of these do anything for us
really um but it's good to know like i
don't think the miter is gonna be good
as the keeper
i'll spend seven cents for there's
option
or there's options because being able to
choose our item from the boss is worth a
lot
like i think we got a good thing going
here
still very tough to win but
certainly like i'm looking at my dps i'm
feeling good
i'm looking at my hp i'm feeling close
to as good as you can
and now we got some some extra
opportunities less damage we take the
more money we get
from wood and nickel
the more money we get from wooden nickel
the more likely we'll be able to take
deals with the devil in the future
that's good stuff the more likely we'll
be able to make that bonus shop work for
us
i don't know why we're charming enemies
so frequently either
but i'm i'm not against it is that what
mulligan does now
oh beauzeba bialzebub of course
i knew that i was just testing to see if
you did
we oh cause we can fly dummy um
you know as the keeper there's a case to
be made that this might not be so bad
but i don't think i can do it just yet
i don't think i can do it just yet we
gotta think about it
the bonus shop also pulls from all pools
oh baby
you do have black candle yeah but i'm
trying to think about like what the the
positive
like like what's the point of taking
cursed eye
there's got to be more of a point than
just you can take it with no downside
like there has to be an upside
because we have to go back into the room
now especially higher dps
i i in zoomer terms i say cap to that
though i don't know do you think it
do you think it's meaningfully higher
dps i'm skeptical i think i gotta march
to the beat of my own drum
if i'm gonna lose i'd i'd rather lose on
my own uh
on my own merits here i mean so we have
to do this
that's just a given
really wanted that to pay out and then
yo placenta's pretty sick i feel like
the
bone heart doesn't do anything for us
so i think we but experimental treatment
is so spicy if we lose hp
so i think we have to take the marrow oh
he just gave us some flies
and i'll tell you i'm going to go to the
bathroom really quick this run is a
chance
i'm not going to run ads but follow me
we're at
very neat we're 11 followers away from
412.
i apologize to the youtube audience but
you got to go you got to go
click the follow button and i won't run
ants see you in a moment
all right youtube call off the dogs
call off the dogs we're back
bubbly in tow
ooh upside down frank or z
what a world
what flavor is that oh that's the peach
bubbly thank you for asking
ooh
i forgot what i was doing we have to hit
all the buttons we have to go to the
the super realm yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
i remember now
you were about to take cursed eye nice
try 10 out of 10
bait mates
so we should we won't be able to fly
when we do this unfortunately
but that's okay it is what it is
this is like a tomah you'd like to come
in huh okay come on
don't go in the baby playpen either
that's not for cats
como he's getting in the chords you you
freaking get in the box okay he got in
the box
no cats allowed
yeah i'm trying to bring back trollololo
i think it's a pretty good meme a top
tier meme
how much pizza is socially acceptable to
eat at a party
well you never take a second well it
depends on the size
if it's reasonable that hurts
that hurts so much more i'm going to die
goodbye
if the size of the party
is reasonable to remember everybody's
consumption
chill chill
then you don't take a second piece until
everybody else has taken their first
piece
i knew it i was like i can't get out of
the way of the freaking fly man
ah
here we go again um yeah you don't take
your second piece until somebody else
has taken their uh
until everybody else has finished their
first piece
if you're in a situation where like
there's some
maybe like a pizza party for example i
don't know i think the idea of the host
is that you kind of eat to your heart's
content
i mean like what you shouldn't do i
guess
is is treat it as if it's like
you know like if you're at the pizza
party you should remember you're not
at the party to just eat as much pizza
as possible
like it's so everybody can have a fun
time
like many things in life i don't think
there's like a hard and fast rule that
i mean the easy answer is like don't be
a weirdo about it or you won't get
invited back i guess
that's the easy answer the more
complicated answer i don't know
you know did if you if you have to ask
you should probably slow down is the
answer
[Laughter]
and don't even get me started about the
about the
crust situation you know if you're if
you're eating a slice
and then you throw your crust away and
then you'd go for a second slice right
away because you're done with the first
one
you got to bake in like at least another
30 to
90 seconds for everybody to finish their
crust before you start the next round
don't be the person who like you know
is 50 of the way through the their slice
of pizza and then grabs another one to
put on their plate just so that nobody
else can have it that's too much
it's simply too much
is it socially acceptable to ask to eat
other people's crusts
i mean you can i think if it's a close
friend or like
a spouse you can ask if it's someone you
basically just met
or have like a business relationship
with absolutely not
it truly it would be an unbelievable
faux pas
that's interesting let me think about
that for a second
um i'm gonna think about it a little
longer
you know what no i'm not we're just
gonna take chaos because in my head i
was milling it about and i was like well
we don't really need to get
chaos because we can get deals from
anything now um
you know we can just pay for deals with
our money like we're not going to get
gated out of the devil deal pool so the
the use case for chaos is a little lower
and then in my head i just went you know
what like don't be a baby like
just just take it every other win like
i've ever gotten on a difficult
challenge in isaac is essentially just
come from
go you know going my own way
why not take the ladder i want to save
the money for deals with the devil on
the next floor i consider the latter
a low yield item
but high heats no not really still still
pretty low you
all right that's unfortunate
but it is what it is moving on
now that's good stuff
yeah i use dad's key to try to find the
second secret room
oh like literally like you know you just
got to pick your battles in chat like
anybody that's like you should take it
over wooden penny you can just discount
they don't know what they're talking
about like they honestly they've
probably never beaten mama's isaac much
less like
you know the hush is the keeper
you basic there's probably some
situations
like you could concoct them you can
concoct any situation to support your
point in this game though that's so good
um but uh
99 percent of the time holding onto
wooden nickels gonna be the right
decision
and like a hundred percent of the time
it's gonna be a pretty good decision
rarely are you gonna encounter one where
you're like oh i
screwed myself by by holding on to this
amazing item
okay metronome is pretty bad we don't
need bombs immediately let's move along
here save your money for a deal with the
devil
this yeah i don't want to jinx it i do
kind of wish i had some bombs now
admittedly but i'm glad we got money
so if we do things right
don't don't spin over here if we do
things right
we should have a pretty good chance to
have a deal with the devil
although now that i think you know what
i'm i was about to get hit instead i
didn't because i'm built different um i
don't think a deal with the devil is
that strong though because it's gonna
have
uh items from any pool so it's possible
that it's not gonna be worth anything
but now hold on that's that's the new d
infinity
i think that's actually not good
unfortunately any other character i
would probably consider it
but uh as the keeper i don't think you
can do it
i think you gotta stick with that wooden
nickel
any other character you do it
yo new infinity you can pick what dice
you use that's pretty sick
i still don't know what uh which one i
would use though
i'm like uh
i i'm happy with where we stand d6 if
you use a d6 though you re-roll your
your wooden nickel
shouldn't have picked it up
the nickel is the keeper is insanely
good like i'm
surprised that how like i mean we've
been through this before but i guess a
lot of people weren't around like
for for some of the later like
afterbirth plus episodes on youtube
we don't really do zayn for zayn's sake
anymore because like it's not that much
uh
fun to just be like low like i made an
actual bad decision and lost
like like chaos is a little zane
with some risk and a possible reward but
just getting rid of wooden nickel and
being like well i'm dumb
is kind of like i don't know
insubordinate and and churlish
and plus if you go zany like to the
freaking
you know until the sweat go drips down
your you know whats
every single time
sure it's not zany anymore
if you're if you're always zany then
you're like you know you're never zany
you're just like i'm the guy who's
afraid to win so i just
throw runs away i'm in charge of my own
destiny
but your suffering is 20 of my value bro
have you been reading
the back seating like then you should be
having like the the 20
of my value that's your suffering should
have been like 5x this stream so far
are you reading some of the advice
that's coming in here it's it'll blow
your mind
you know it's not great
but a 7 cent robo baby 2.0 is
is something worth more than a dang
ladder at least
flying is good
keeper does look funny
look at the keeper smiling
no no no no no hold on we need bombs
dross too we need bombs
any particular reason you're playing as
uh the keeper
yeah i mean we gotta play as everybody
to like to unlock everything
you have about no i mean i need bombs to
go to the next alt path
so we need to play as the keeper at some
point anyway just to
just to get everything unlocked that
needs to get unlocked
hold on i'm just taking a little
tolerance break for my own sanity
[Laughter]
i'm just looking at the at the at the
wall
thank you apollo i appreciate that
actually you you've
like a guardian angel you have swooped
down in a moment of
great uh strife for me and you have
gifted me salvation
i came one freight neuron away from
losing my
my mind and then i
i just a single shut up weirdos from
apollo has
has given me the greatest gift of all
some inner peace no no no
okay that's fine we weren't gonna get a
deal with the devil anyway
i'm not sweating hold your bombs this is
spooky
no i'm bad and take the pill shot speed
up that was a risky pill
i know what you do now i know what you
do now
chill out couple of bombs here and there
can of corn
just remember what mouth says can of
corn and i'll be all right
okay certainly not the item you're
looking for
certainly not the item you're looking
for
we've already done keeper mega satan
okay get me out of here
there's plays there's plays you drop two
of these
you go to the boss strap room you use
the emperor card
not the emperor sorry you use the moon
card to get out of the
boss trap room or you okay just just
relax on that for a second as long as we
don't walk in the blue fires we're doing
well
still pretty good still very good
get the bubbly burps man he's got the
bubbly burps
okay white fire mirror
uh definitely i don't see myself
fighting the boss on this one
did you see that apollo is getting a
haircut
that's pretty exciting
that means uh mouth can't be far behind
i don't know mouth might keep the
lettuce rolling though i don't know
probably a better trinket oh malthus do
yeah i mean like it honestly the long
hair it kind of suits him
i don't even mean that facetiously like
he's kind of like
i never thought about it but he's kind
of like a long hair sort of guy
especially with the beanie on it looks
uh it looks cool
i'm vibing with it
has anyone ever seen mouth without his
hat
uh yeah it's been a while though for
sure
apollo are you reading this man is this
what among us is like
[Laughter]
this i can't complain it's just a
staggering amount of like
nonsense questions over and over oh my
god
500 people saying tinted rock when you
don't have a bomb
talking about mouths hair 900 people say
when are you getting your hair cut low
i thought all your friends were bald
lull like it's crazy
man just chill out
if you were funnier than me you wouldn't
be watching me you'd be watching shibley
right now
it's a simple calculus
he's not on that's true might have gone
a little hard during apex legends
yesterday
lfg
it's the easter crowd yeah i didn't
realize like guess what easter you're
like the new st patrick's day for me
welcome to the list of bad holidays
hello mr anez
thank you for the gifted subscription
i'm not gonna lie it is it is swages the
the salt slightly okay hold on hold on
that could be very good
no don't hit me we don't care about big
fan
like that item getting out of here
that's no big deal
i'm just wondering if sacrificial or
roba baby for that matter
i'm just wondering if we're going to
actually get um devil deal items out of
this or
because of chaos they'll just be like
normal items but either way i think it's
a good idea
those are definitely devil deal items
it's you're probably right it's all the
like uh cadbury mini eggs and stuff like
that
those cream eggs they probably got like
30 grams of sugar in each one
i stood right in the middle of that wait
wait wait there's a theme a theme has a
higher chance to give you uh
demon hearts right it's go no they took
it out i forgot they took it out
i tried to save it by uh
by ranking it in the d tier but you guys
had no chill you were like he's a fool
it's an a tier
edmond watched and was like oh we gotta
knock that out in the dlc
way to go guys way to go
made them nerf a d-tier item because you
couldn't keep your chill
it's one heck of a room okay
leave that we can go to the curse room
now
it's a great song you got to admit
apollo have you caught um a hound doom
yet
i don't know if you're still here you
basically said told people to shut up
and then left
which i really and this is genuine i
respect
you are here okay you said good one
thank you i learned it from chipley
i thought i had a joke for you the other
day but i can't remember what it was
it was a good one though like rest the
shirt like in my head i was like oh
apollo would love this one
so like if you could just laugh and say
thank you that would be ideal
sounds funny like it was a good one
haha
what
all right at least at least he took
himself out of the equation there for a
second
i've never seen large bomb
man you know be crazy you don't be one
heck of a meme
is like imagine if we like picked up a
damage upgrade at some point
sorry sorry that's not fair we have the
pact
i don't see what you're complaining
about you've you've been uh
you've only been on the run for 38
minutes you already have one damage
upgrade like i don't see what you're
complaining about
yeah the mark that's what i meant same
difference
this is gonna do it man this is gonna do
it
okay blanket is holy mantle on the boss
fight
and a bunch of flies i actually think
that's
pretty amazing i think we need that for
maximum devil deals then we use the
devil deals to give us the maximum
chance of
uh actually getting a useful item
despite the fact that
now that i think about it it's not gonna
it's gonna be chaos but still
okay
dull rays are a thing i again it's like
you're not
necessarily wrong but like
we got it it takes a lot to get rid of
wooden nickel
and i'm not sure that like a thame doing
a little damage is uh
is what we're looking for they won't
even let me keep the hanged man
yeah if we had swallowed penny then then
maybe well if we had swallowed penny
then definitely
okay i'm feeling okay here
this is like the boss i love the seed
this boss listens to reason
it does attacks that in some
circumstances are dodgeable
which i'm i highly approve of i was
literally just about to pick up the
freaking
my devil no we still got a good devil
deal chance how did that happen
well it like as good as it was when
before we came in because we had already
taken a hit i think
don't hit me dude come on be reasonable
oh it's because it's not the final room
yet it's an xl floor
yeah okay well you know
suppose we might as well
i mean i'd still like to win this blue
baby like you know
it's still got to be done as well this
is going to be annoying
yeah i'm less worried i would oh my gosh
i i'd say for the time being like i'm
less worried about my character
and much more worried about like how i'm
gonna get the means with which
to actually like finish this run
because it's a little unimpressive right
now it's a little underpowered
hello
come on guys you're taking like 12 shots
right to the face
actually now i'm just like i'm concerned
we may actually just
die
we have invisible enemies okay that's
fine that's fine a thame will take care
of them
can of corn can of corn and i'll be all
right
invisible marty's welcome
okay what's 16 chance it's like one in
one and six pick a number between
one and six chad
everybody that said four you're getting
the deal with the devil
clip farming 101 baby
don't kill me just begging you not to
kill me
just we gotta take dad's ring
use oh get me out of here okay okay hold
on d7 reroll rewards don't mind if i
don't
elden ring
yeah apollo don't be shy tell us what
you ordered
i had some poke yesterday
saved i haven't chosen yet well don't be
shy what are the options
it sucks oh i guess you you probably got
like a low
choice coefficient today because of uh
easter sunday right
that's probably one of those times you
sign into uber eats and it's like all
you've got is
uh you know it's like burger king pizza
hut
i'm about to get zach's piece i'm the
zaxby's
scooby-doo
you know the vibe
zaxby's is good i've never i've never
had it
canada lags behind in the in the
the chicken game
we got great i mean in vancouver at
least great like korean fried chicken
but as far as like chain chicken
restaurants
not so much popeyes is starting to
spread there's a few
churches
i think there's like a chick-fil-a in in
downtown toronto
you know we need in canada man we need
some shake shacks
admittedly i've only eaten that one but
like
i was very impressed i was very
impressed
i you know that's the kind of thing
where you're like maybe if i didn't have
0.9 speed there would be some hope for
me
yo shadow insurgent thank you for the
gifted subs as well
that's fine at least we got the the coin
shortcut oh that's not a shortcut at all
the speed man okay good good good good
good
don't get trapped get saved
long room i was set up for failure there
like i've only i saw someone say
let's go by the way i uh the baby let's
go
i saw someone say that five guys is
better than shake shack
i will own up to the fact that i've only
eaten that uh
one five guys and one shake shack but
it wasn't even close like the shake
shack blew it out of the water
maybe it was a bad five guys maybe it
was a great shake shack
but it was like it wasn't even a contest
bro i'm still gonna die what
ah he's the smartest man alive
saved
joanna won
new joanna just dropped
yeah like i don't know like i know it's
very like
north america is a land of um
contradictions
i guess you know it's just any time you
get a lot of people
there's a lot of opinions right
everybody eats
uh from chain restaurants now and then
but you have to like almost pretend that
it never happens or like you were forced
into it like you didn't have a choice
if you were ever like where do you want
to eat and you're an adult and you say
wendy's
people will get like in your face
they'll be like you can eat anyone you
live in a
a city with amazing food options you
want to eat at wendy's
like dude sometimes a spicy chicken
would just hit the spot
this is highly scary
straight up i'm like outback she's like
chili's so then finally i suggested
taylor's
which is the place i knew she wanted to
go anyway
and she was like if that's what you want
dare roll i looked that woman right in
the windows of her soul
and i said i can't i can't do the thing
where i don't look at the screen
i'm gonna die
what am i doing what it worked i'm alive
i'm great
that's the thing like i do i love a
chain restaurant
it's not it doesn't make up the bulk of
my my food intake
i don't know what how to stop you okay
so if you could just
frick off um i named seven more
restaurants
no no finally i suggested taylor's the
place i knew she wanted to go anyway
anyway i like a i like a chain uh i like
a chain restaurant
because then like i've said it before
you don't just get a meal you get a
conversation too
because you can talk about the
restaurant that you ate at
with other people who have eaten at that
restaurant
instead of like you know in you know in
vancouver i could go eat it like an
amazing place go eat like miku or you
know bishops or something like that
now i'm talking to somebody that's from
south carolina i can't be like oh i
hated this awesome place
you've never heard of before you know
what i mean
i mean you could do it but it's very
like you know it's self-aggrandizing
you're just like let me tell you about
this awesome meal i ate that you can't
possibly have the same experience of
instead you go you go eat at a long john
silvers you could be like you know what
i had yesterday
long john silvers
they'll be like yo pog or uh
monka don't you know the ceo of long
john silver's 19 years ago
was on a news interview and he said like
he
uh hates charities or something like
that and you're like oh come on man
i did i didn't look that up in the full
audit before i bought the hush puppies
but it's pretty sweet right it's a fun
time
come on man
i just walked though i suggested seven
more restaurants
yeah i'm gonna be really mad if uh
america kills long john silvers before i
get to eat there
i guess they're not really in an
expansion phase right like they're kind
of
on the way out uh well nevertheless okay
okay that's something
i don't know why i'm like lying to
myself saying like there's any chance
long john silvers is gonna like
you know they're coming back man they're
coming back
i don't even know what you do like i
don't know what your thing is
how can like a a chain seafood
restaurant be bad
like if you deep fry almost anything
that came from the ocean
it tastes great i don't understand how
you can screw it up
the fish is fine joey's only is bad
yo you pump the brakes in
in my hometown well if in my in my
hometown if you're uptown
joey's that's the place where you go
if you want fish and chips if you're
downtown you probably go to the pilot
house or something but
okay okay now we're talking fashion
chops
shut up mom where's my fashion chops
oh the tower you know they buffed it
recently
for they've recently added more hops
take book of shadows it's actually like
a really good idea
that's like an insanely good idea also
an insanely good idea
what the heck
uh don't pick up the coin when you don't
need it
what are you doing come on are you
busking this is so tricky oh i do do we
have epiphora am i insane
we've had epiphora this whole time huh
would have helped us out on some of
these rooms that take 20 years
i.e every room in the game
so i know apollo's here so i'm laying it
on a little thick we did get a deal
okay i mean
i feel like charm of the vampire is
pretty sick here
uh holy grail unfortunately is not good
for us
unless i'm missing something but
holy grail does damage now it's
worthless now
it's good now
thanks i really appreciate it head eyes
i'm dead are you shooting are you
walking on metal
i don't know just take it hard to argue
with that honestly
okay i guess you know i'm trying to
think it is nice to explore
because if we get more money like oh we
only need to do this
this menagerie one time right like
if we could just get
a like a combo that just wins the game
for you
it'll really go a long way well this
would be bookworm
or it could just be a key as well that
could be stolen from me cool yeah
yeah brimstone would hit the spot no
doubt about that
dude every every
youtube uh run of isaac is either
let me rephrase every stream vod that
ends up as a standalone episode on
youtube
is either 80 minutes long or 21 minutes
long there's literally no exception
it's just it's it's madness
it's a war of attrition
okey-dokey
just a wee bit of trolling i mean i'm
not upset about the
the holy grail situation we it's fine we
got keys
we spent some money on something we
didn't need to spend money on that's not
that big of a deal
okay not secret rooms possible secret
room
that's really good that's very valuable
i'm begging you
i'm begging i know you're
you're not like the best demon judgment
we could ever ask for but you're the
demon judgment we got
chaos or otherwise
i'm keeping the salt mostly at bay
because i you know
that's not really like who i am as a
streamer it's like let's just complain
about
things i mean like i complain about
things in real life when it comes to the
games i'm like the games are precious
don't don't uh don't insult the games
um that being said like i'm
there's been a couple repentance runs
where i'm like
who hurt you
it's your favorite thing to complain
about it's definitely like people
not like i don't know
it's very minor i would never try to
suggest like it's good
like or a healthy frame of mind the
number one thing i complain about
is is in this recurring theme of people
like being so lost in their
own world they inhibit other people
around them you know distracted drivers
people asking for you know too many
samples at the deli counter
stuff like that is like you know
something turns you into the joker but
like in a
in a very pedestrian sense
please don't give me hope no key beggar
you know what sure just go for it man
just just go for it man
oh don't even get me started on that on
the ante masters dude
and now like we got they they shut down
indoor dining
in the uh vancouver but so now they
took the they made patios but then they
closed in the patios
so they made the outside inside
but it's like apparently that's like
some kind of loophole or something like
that where the virus is like oh
we can't do anything they made the
inside outside
exactly we made the outside inside
yeah everyone everybody knows like the
virus
is powerless if you're on a patio
especially one that's been closed in and
has literally no ventilation
and if you're in a classroom like it
just it simply can't hurt you
all the science is it points to this
this one conclusion
but mostly like i mean i i'm not trying
like we can just stay inside like i you
know that's
we're blessed in that sense that we can
essentially just
look it's mighty tempting i don't think
we're gonna lose our uh
i don't think we're gonna lose the knife
in the process this might be a genuine
re-roll here
i think we do it
i have no idea what this is but it's
actually
freaking sick let's let's try it out
um
i don't know it seems pretty good
we did lose wooden nickel that's pretty
bad
[Laughter]
yeah that's that's optimal
um but like i
i think we're on the cusp of things
getting like pretty bad in canada again
hopefully it's like the last time they
get pretty bad
um because the you know vaccination
obviously is like ongoing but
it's like on the cusp of like real
badness here again
like this genuinely i'm not trying to
like bring it down but like
in bc and ontario right now like this is
the most apprehensive i've been about
kovitz since like last
march or last april maybe
the the spread of the variance here in
particular and
you know that that combined with the
fact that like absolutely well i
shouldn't say nobody
but like so few people seem to actually
be doing
precautions anymore because they're like
uh my grandma got vaccinated so the
whole thing's over
you know as soon as like vaccines
started happening like oh now now that
everybody in south dakota
can get vaccinated like why should i
have to wear a mask in canada you know
like it's it's getting a little uh
a little spicy up here again for sure
but we can just uh you know we're lucky
we work from home
okay that's pretty sick we can mostly
just hang out at home and
you know ride it out till we get
vaccinated which seems like it's
probably gonna be
hopefully in may but maybe in early june
which is still like i mean it's it's a
ways away but it's
you know the finish line at least you
know
part of the finish line is on the
horizon
yeah we must have curse of the or not
curse we must have dog tooth
okay what's our
do you think we still have guppy no do
you think we still have brim
no do you think we still have the ankh
that's what i was trying to say
because we have an extra life but i
don't know what it came from
how did the u.s manage to beat canada at
vaccines
well like aren't i i was gonna say
aren't you but like
oh the green one i'm following me you're
right isn't the us like making them
they if they produce it like it makes it
makes sense
plus and again this is like the overly
mature
response like obviously like i want to
get vaccinated but like
things were worse in the us it makes
sense from a public health standpoint
that they would get them
first although that's not really how
they're being distributed i guess like
in terms of greatest need
but it's it's kind of hard to be too
salty about it when there's still the
opportunity to just be mad at like my
own
uh fellow citizens for like
just not following the precautions at
all
okay hold on hold on
you can tap shoot it's a little slow
but i can tap shoot
we need to find a way to get some money
you know what just this card
now we're talking
let's go yeah exactly
this is definitely not gg i'm i resent
the gg call here
yeah i mean we have the same thing
because i don't we don't even need to
get into it like too much but
um
great damage okay this actually might be
gg
[Laughter]
doesn't matter what we take
just make sure you take the alt path
that's that's insanely good damage
that sucks thank god we had the justice
card backing us up we we still need some
form of defense like i'm not getting my
hopes up too much yet
i'm shaking saved i told you like nobody
cares about the defense man until it's
too late
we need we need like one more thing here
to really get it going
um but yeah we got like the same thing
going in uh
in vancouver where there's like a few
restaurants that
are like no we're not gonna shut down
and then they've become like you know
rallying points for
uh idiocy to be fair
and uh and it's just like oh it's just
like i
i'm just like exclusively my my only
reaction is like i'm just
i'm just ben affleck.jpeg you know what
i mean like i'm just
i'm either picking up a bunch of dunkin
donuts on my front step begging the
paparazzi not to take a photo of me or
like
i'm smoking a cigarette on my front step
just being like i'm so sick of this
nonsense like you could just
wait you just wait like like two months
the government doesn't want you to have
sangria on the patio i'm like i just
just just two months just do it in may
the weather's not even like nice yet
the government doesn't want you to have
mozzarella sticks with your friends
okay we we need bombs for sure
oh
[Laughter]
no not yet not yet we hold them
we hold them and we use it as a uh
we use it as a desperation play
like there was somebody on the vancouver
subreddit i was laughing so hard like
they're
not all of them but like they're so
gleeful about like
breaking the rules and i'm just like
like somebody was like
hey don't want to make you guys jealous
but i have 18 friends over right now at
my house playing video games and they
posted it like
like on 10 different threads and i'm
just like
nobody cares loser you really you got 18
friends over your house and you're like
i gotta go
post about it on reddit like are you are
you stupid
also you've got 18 friends over at your
house playing video games what the hell
are you playing
are you doing like a full eu4 game like
if so like that makes me a little more
jealous than anything else to be honest
you're playing jack box you little
too full among us lobbies sorry paul i
didn't want it's your day off i don't
wanna
i was just like man you posted like like
a hundred times
it's it's just kind of humorous i've
never been in a situation where i've
like been at like a party and having a
great time and been like hold on i gotta
go post about it
on unread it of all places so hey
you okay this keep it moving
okay that's stocks in this business we
say stocks and then we head down to the
next floor
that's not good because we really could
have used something that gave us a
material advantage instead of merely
some currency but
it is what it is
it it just reminds me of like that um
the nathan fielder picture
this like you know having a great time
with my friends they're all here
laughing just out of frame
like it's like i'm having me and my
friends are having such a good time you
guys are so owned right now like living
in fear watching netflix
i've got 18 of my closest friends over
playing video games just out of frame
you think does yamaha give us
a coin as the keeper or a fly
it probably just gives us a fly
you know what we got money we got keys
like we might as well test it yo it
gives us a coin dude
it gives us a coin or nothing but it
makes me think that it's giving me a
coin
oh yeah i forgot you live
i'm telling you though like and this is
like i'm apologizing like on behalf of
canadians okay um to to my american
countrymen because if you're like
american
or from the uk and you're getting like
vaccinated already and you're you know
17 or 20 or whatever your canadian
friends are gonna be like a little
annoyed you know i i find myself even
getting a little annoyed
it's it's not a uh it's not a nice thing
to say
but it's like you know even like a
couple of weeks ago i was like i'm happy
for people
but i really wish that i was getting
vaccinated too
so that like i could go out and eat
dinner
and now like things are getting kind of
bad and now i'm like i want to get
vaccinated so i could not
end up in a hospital with that p1
variant
so i i really do think that we're
getting into a position where like the
the vaccine fomo is going to hit like a
fever pitch for a bit
just i just ask you to like be nice to
you know canadians recognize you know
it's not your american friend's fault
that
you know you're not vaccinated yet and
then uh you know
americans recognize if the shoe were on
the other foot you'd probably be a
little annoyed as well
well let's give it a try man
i still see us getting hit
use it oh no okay we get hit one more
time we take the pill
please
he can keep getting away with it
it's still hard man is still hard
i lived somehow where's my coin
saved
i'm alive again
okay let's do some exploring
[Laughter]
this this boss is so freaking hard dude
you got something for me
i would have lost my freaking mind
i would have i might have uninstalled
you might have caught me in a moment of
weakness and i might have uninstalled
right there
freaking sexy mimics
it's so difficult you know don't
we need it we i mean i i get what people
are saying like put bombs out there but
like
even i mean i i i think it's like one of
those things where i'm just like we're
still gonna get hit
like
[Laughter]
and try as i might like the damage
output will help out a lot don't get me
wrong
it's gonna be worth something
unfortunately assuming the okay that was
one up so we actually
can't get
there's no point really the playing the
blood bank
we could use that for one extra like hp
in a moment of weakness but
the blood bank has has low value right
now okay
i don't know man i feel like we're we're
still better off with yum heart than
than book of belial
like i still feel like defense is the
name of the game like we're not going to
be rushing this guy down to the point
that he's gonna like
like i don't think having like super
high damage output is gonna get us there
that's what i'm saying
isn't the blood bank free okay now now
you're gonna make me lose my mind up in
here
up in here because uh
i mean it's something we covered like
right at the start of the run
come on
i can't do it it can't be done
can't be done can be done
i can't do it right now
we gotta give ourselves a try i'm trying
to think of what card it could even be
that would really
send us and there's some stuff that
would be half decent
but then there's other stuff that i'm
like i mean i don't think it would be
enough to move the needle
i think the best way to move the needle
is to not die
sonova for no reason
try to get it moving drop some bombs in
there
drop some drop more bombs in there
i think we're on one hit i'm one tap
he's one tenth
i walked into it we were gonna die
anyway
but that's not the way you want to go
[Laughter]
the odds of me not getting hit in phase
two were pretty low
dude this run is uh is hard it's



hey uh we're gonna try to like i've been
getting my butt kicked in isaac on
stream today so we're just gonna play as
isaac
and try to go to the the secret door
which i think i understand how to get to
but uh we'll see
i mean you can try to roast me in chat
for not having done that well today but
like
we we exclusively swung for the fences
we were mainlining like the hardest
characters trying to get to the
the alt path exclusively so i'm not like
too upset about
uh about today
i thought we did a uh you know you're
gonna you're gonna break a few eggs if
you try to make a sick omelette
yeah plus we crush trivia so no sweat
dude
so i don't think we need to go
to um the alt path on this one i think
we well in fact i think we have to not
go to the old path because the secret
door is like only in the depths i think
golden bombs you guys remember that song
uh
golden scans by the clack songs what the
heck were they talking about you know
what i'm you know what i'm saying
what were they talking about in that
song is they're not saying i'm saying
they're saying that golden scans are
well
you can't look at your future like what
were they saying man
we put bombs in your bombs
it was golden sands it was not you look
go look up the song it's called golden
scans
i have an encyclopedic knowledge of all
musics
i can't believe you would try to to step
up to me on this one
in incoming oh sorry my bad
don't worry i'll wait okay we don't want
to buy blind items here
like it's not a bad song but i'm just
like i just don't know what they're
talking about like what the heck is this
is a golden scan man
like a radar scan or like what are they
saying
i never know i don't know where this
bit's going
it is yeah okay i see what you're saying
they do say ooh a lot in that song
oh i don't maybe that's what a golden
scan is maybe it's a type of like gold
leaf you can put on a pizza
i'm embarrassed with myself but you know
what it happens from time to time
uh let's look for secret rooms this is a
secret room play
wait is that chibly's
he's gone too far
oh it's justin's oh they got they got a
two-parter emote
those geniuses
we should do more emo team-ups
or teemo eat-ups you know if we can get
ross to get down with it
um like you know they do like
brand uh partnerships like they'll be
like hey like louis vuitton is gonna
make lightning from final fantasy 13
wear like
you know some kind of leather bound book
or something like that
we should do that on on stream like yo
new new nl cross uh ludwig just dropped
that'd be pretty sick i could just make
a papa emote without even asking him i
[Laughter]
suppose
that's that's garbage that's garbage um
it's garbage
probably the best bomb i've ever placed
it's up there at least
yeah like apollo do you want to do like
we should do some kind of team up
like there's got to be like could you
could somebody draw the among
us in a in isaac style and then draw
isaac in the among us style and we could
we could swap son of a gun man
we could swap him
that'd be pretty sick he's still talking
to apollo he was here i saw him say
lmfao when i got when i
couldn't figure out how to add two
colors together
kate if i gave you two colors of light
and said what do they make when they're
added together would you be able to
answer the question
i can't take these items or i will be
killed i'll take that one but i can't
take uh
i can't take the other one i think it
was cyan okay we totally could have
taken it
um it was like oh it was green and blue
green and blue yeah is it like purple
it's cyan this is what i did when i saw
the question
cyclope what is zion color
it's like it's super super blue it's
like light blue
light blue light blue
you know like tuco salamanca
good good light light light
ag
hello
hey baby she's she's like i don't really
know what's going on but this is pretty
cool
i do i like the polka dots
yo how'd she like the cucumber food she
said
okay she's not
not a huge fan of the cucumber then
that's honestly she hey
she must get that from you because
cucumber one of my favorite vegetables

she's very excited right now huh
oh isaac poggy

hey hey hey okay hold on second secret
room

yeah
they they've they've taken it too far
go i've got she's like mommy you don't
get it
daddy's like the best isaac player of
all time and he still gets into
he still gets into trouble
why is it hard they basically enemies
are like
they shoot faster like old enemies have
like faster attack patterns
um and then some of the new floors are
like
a new enemies i should say you you gotta
have like a phd in tuhu to understand
what's going on
touhou tuhu touhou
big summer blowout
anti-pog there's some anti-pog
technology there
hey
all right kind of a tough run here
i don't know we can fly flying's pretty
sweet
i think i'm ready moving on
it's so cute when she smiles i think i'm
gonna cry
ah
i think we got a good chance here
when baby smiles i smile too
i'm just surprised you know i don't want
to ruin the moment i'm surprised there's
nobody in chat like oh
baby you're eating your hand wrong the
way you should eat your hand is
just making a joke
um have you ever considered eating uh
your other hand instead of exclusively
that one maybe godhead is inside your
other hand
hey goo yeah she probably said shut up
that's fine
she's not wrong
yeah she's she's a grown baby now
she's six months old
it's like six months and one week and
then like
i mean this is spoilers for like i mean
it's not really spoilers for eyes like
it's spoilers for the commentary
but um i had her in the playpen when i
was recording today which is just behind
me
and then i heard her going like oh oh
and then i looked behind me and she had
rolled over
like onto her stomach and was like just
chilling there on her
on her hands and knees and i was like
what the heck
you can do that now and then i
oh she's a very happy baby right now
then i you know she's having some
trouble like rolling herself back over
i looked over like five minutes later
and she was just like passed out on her
stomach
like with with no power in her muscles
left
but
usually like when she laughs she's like
she's very
laffy you can go oh
there's a knock on the door on easter
sunday no less
what's up with that
oh there's another kid could close my
office okay i'm gonna
just be one moment please i'm just gonna
put us on break for a moment just in
case
all right i'm back it was just the son
of god
love that guy i was like hey i forgot
it's your day
and he was like he's very gracious about
it but
he was like yeah it's only once a year
you know you could have at least put out
the nice uh cutlery
do you have a minute to talk about me oh
that's a good bit
hold on people keep saying is what the
heck is modulatory
i mean the game says it's the directory
is right for me
seems like you may have a pep cac issue
on your end
okay keep it moving i was like wait a
minute oh jesus i'm sorry i forgot it
was the 40th day from the
vernal equinox my bad buddy
i gotta get some mileage out of that
joke before it becomes completely
irrelevant
i forgot we had passed uh petrarch's
apoapsis
he's so good uh you're alive his worst
enemy in the game now
this guy worst enemy in the game full
stop full stop i hate you
why is everyone so pog about easter this
year
i don't think it's i don't know i i
haven't noticed a disproportionate
amount of easter pogging
it is in my opinion the first real hot
really
oh you gotta shoot down here okay
i think it's the first real holiday on
the calendar right so like
he has risen
well yeah i sure hope somebody got fired
for that blunder
what about new year's day i don't know
like new year's eve i think is like a
real holiday new year's day i'm always
like i'll take it
it's like when they give you a fortune
cookie after your meal it's like i never
would have ordered this for myself but
like if you're gonna give me a day i'm
not gonna say no
obviously it's kind of nice to have the
day off
apart from that i'm like you know i mean
we get into the cool holidays now
you know christmas is pretty close
uh oh dude okay so rune bag like isn't
as good anymore but that's still
freaking sick
it's like free tortilla chips at a
mexican restaurant
i hear you
there are perks of like eden in man like
it's very minor like obviously there's
other
negatives about covid but i'm still like
i'm beating the same
drum there are some foods that just
don't deliver as well
and i i miss them a little bit i haven't
had a good hamburger in a long time
i mean honestly i could be making my own
to be fair but
you know i i just me personally it takes
a little bit more motivation for me to
like
make a hamburger than it does to just
buy one from like a when you're eating
out because you gotta
it's you know you you buy enough ground
beef for like one burger
probably not right in one bun you're
probably gonna end up getting like
a bunch of burgers a bunch of buns and
then you're like am i really gonna
eat like six burgers in two days i kind
of only wanted one
i mean it's not i'm not saying it's like
super negative i'm just saying
you know for me personally i'd rather uh
give me the ace of clubs here man i
could use these bombs
you know i treat eating out sometimes as
an opportunity to eat things that like i
don't want to
make for myself for one reason or
another i don't buy burger stuff that
often uh
for myself uh just because you know
usually i don't want like six burgers
usually i just want like
maybe like one and a half burgers
we have a freezer but like
i'm gonna put like fill up my actually
you know we have like the ultimate
freezer excuse right now which is
there's literally like
you know 20 liters of breast milk in our
freezer so
there's really no space for like
anything else
but uh you know once we work our way
through that
i don't know i'm surprised of the people
who are like oh you know
just use your freezer you have a craving
for one food you buy like eight times
more than your craving and then freeze
it
and then what do you do oh well you know
wait until you can't put anything in
your freezer and then throw out the
seven burgers when you move or whatever
can you actually freeze breast milk oh
kate we forgot to look it up in the
rigorous
uh analysis we did before having the
baby
cage chat's got it off chat
as the very we looked it up it's fine
i wouldn't sweat it okay i'm gonna go to
this curse room real quick
do we have we don't have a reroll
pedestal
i will take these i'm not scared
just never really thought of it i mean
like why would you right like
[Laughter]
is that an easy hack to get regular milk
you could just buy
ice cream and let it melt i think
there's a there's a catch though right
which is that like ice cream
uh is not just milk
and then the second catch is that is
sometimes more expensive than milk to
begin with
oh just what i've always wanted rocky
road milk
i'm not this is like one oh dude new uh
new animation just dropped
it's one of those things where i'm like
you know i remember where i lost a lot
of uh
optimism for the internet is like when i
first heard what a life hack was i was
like this is gonna change everything
like before life hacks you had to just
like hope you met
somebody that had some kind of like cool
secret way they're like oh here's the
trick to like doing this
and then you know you would spread it by
word of mouth i thought the internet was
gonna like revolutionize it i thought it
was gonna democratize
those neat little tricks and then you
know we all learned how to like fold a
t-shirt properly in four seconds
and that was the only one like every
other life hack is actually
it's just useless it's just not good
we'll take it we'll take it
like i i can't even the only other life
hack i can even think of is like the one
where it was like
you know hey life pro tip like you're uh
you're peeling bananas from the wrong
end
it's like nobody cares
what do you mean the wrong end i've
never like peeled a banana and been like
oh
it's reversed you know it's just a
banana
i love that one so what so you like you
know you peel the banana from like the
nub instead of the
the thing at the top how does that
change anything though
i don't understand i also i used
i did that for probably like six or
seven years i peeled my bananas like
that and was like one of these days i'm
gonna like master
it and i i really i just went back the
the maybe like three or four years ago
and i was like i think that the tab is
actually just better
i think the tab is uh i i prefer to use
the tab
having done both quite a lot
anyway it's not a problem either way i
mean i can you think of like a life tip
you've learned on the internet that's
actually
like helped you out there's probably
some i'm not saying there's none
but
none okay maybe there's none
i feel like like like meal prepping is
like
a nice life hack that really spread
even wider after the internet got on got
onto it
that that's a positive for sure
brushing my teeth in the shower
i mean i guess it's a life hack
people are going to be mad at you for
that one but i i say live your life
is a waste of water for sure
i remember sheryl crow saying that she
only like to save the environment she
only used one piece of toilet paper
anytime she wiped her butt and then like
everybody was like ew and then she was
forced to give a statement like a couple
of weeks later where she was like
i was just joking about all that i just
thought it'd be funny
and i was like i don't think so
okay tomo wants to come in all right
okay hey tomorrow
hey buddy like here's a live pro tip for
you a life hack
uh buy an air fryer it's freaking hey
don't get into the cords don't ma
get in the box buddy yeah yeah the box
there he goes
oh when you use too small a slice
yeah i'm a folder not a not a crusher
i mean it might be like tmi but
the crusher let's not call them crushers
let's call them crumplers
i understand it but i'm a folder for
sure and i got to tell you again this is
tmi as well but like
the baby since she started eating solid
food like if i could go back to that
witch game i would wish for the baby
poops to be
as gentle as they were when she was on a
pure milk diet
because other parents warned me
100 percent they were like hey you know
i know you're
thinking that all the diapers are like
totally fine right now but like wait
till she starts eating solid food and i
was like uh
whatever they were totally right like
the poops have become like cataclysmic
i mean it's still not that bad like you
know i'd rather have like
nasty poops but get a good night's sleep
which is basically how things are going
right now but
they definitely got worse
don't take my eternal heart or i'm gonna
be mad okay
officially not mad
and then re-roll it for free why not
you're right you're already here re-roll
it for free
dude dude red candle dude red candle is
pretty good
now that's an item
i got to think about this for a sec
did you read that they nerfed orbitals i
didn't see that but i did see that they
recently added
more hops
one two three four you know what i i
think we can let's let's
just chill for a minute actually we can
just buy a battery what am i thinking
here
that's pretty sick we could reroll that
too though
oh but we can get the double reroll
i'm re-rolling i'm re-rolling sorry red
candle
you did your best
hold on hold on because doesn't this
give
one full heart every time you use it now
dude that's amazing
converter is is is pog now
confirmed pog now we'll get a charge
we'll re-roll again i mean i don't mind
if we have to roll skinny odd mushroom
and then do some some re-rolls that's
fine although now i don't know if i can
get
what i needed because there's no enemies
left apparently
yeah i don't know if i can actually get
a charge now in fact i'm
one two three boss can't get into the
uh special room there's a mini battery
there's a mini battery thank you
i need enemies please
i'm gonna risk it dude
let's go well worth it hopefully
it's an attempt was made
it is mini mush yeah yeah but minnie
mouse is like it's
minnie mouse it's not that bad minnie
mush is okay
i got no no negatives to say about it
it's not that good but it's terra bad oh
come on don't call it
don't don't make up a new word by mixing
two words together
it's not that that level of badness come
on
charged key is it
i don't think that's a charged key man i
think it's just sparkling
let's let's test it that's just
sparkling
it is okay hold on oscar
nov would you like to explain yourself
there was no asterisk in your message
there was no um
i could be wrong there was no i think in
my opinion i'm guessing etc etc
just said it is
please explain yourself posthaste
welcome to chat court i didn't know
apparently i stole this bit from lemmy
but if you're gonna steal
you might as well steal from like the
funniest person on twitch and if you
can't steal from chibley then you might
as well steal from lemmy
yo pear throw now we're talking um
funny
i still think like because it's a
passive i still think it's pretty good
to reroll these instead and this is
catacombs two catacombs and i'll be all
right kind of
catacombs and i'll be all right
we'll take this because it's fine
and then i think we'll just take skinny
on mushroom it is not terrible
it's actually terra good like terrific
and good instead of terrible and bad
and then we got a per throw for a good
devil deal chance here
hey eat this
take one of these dude pyro with these
bombs would go a long way
1000 gift subs or i reroll brimstone
just kidding
[Laughter]
how funny would that be though anyway um
okay
okay we got it we need a teleporter we
need a teleport card right
i which makes me a little upset at
myself because we had a bunch of
teleporter cards and then i turned them
into uh
ace of clubs which is pretty funny
in hindsight not a good uh
oh the devs two will always have one
okay now we're talking
thank you
very helpful yeah yeah yeah
i think thank you i appreciate those i
thinks
also drop a bad trinket in an item room
really
for what purpose

omega
deja vu right now i feel like i've
already had this conversation before
that's for another thing i think
no need not needed yet okay
not needed yet you think and i think
thank you i think i will say
thank you
yo that's pretty good

i know i just would look was it did i
bring that up just so you'd realize that
i don't forget your name yes
it was a flex i don't want you to think
that i've
you know your name will ever escape my
mind so just be on your best behavior
i think
yes sir there we go yes sir
okay what around depths one it's too
late i've already seen everything
i'm a new-ish chatter yes sir
welcome you picked a good time to buy
in the rocket ship to the moon is gonna
start any day now
i'm new here smile apollo don't make me
go through your unban requests
i actually check them like i check them
maybe once every two days but
i i assumed that from
the among us new map there would be a
lot of uh
on band requests but there were
literally zero
which i think is a good thing
my perthro yoink
okay tinted rock this is my favorite
game can i
find a tinted rock chat was calling out
yes because they told me where it was
that's a charge key i think
[Laughter]
have you ever watched bojack horseman so
here's the thing and you're
nobody's gonna be happy with this okay
so we might as well just get it out of
the way
um i've heard the show is amazing
i watched like episode one season one it
didn't do it for me i hear it gets a lot
better
this was like seven years ago or
something like that um
but here's what i'm gonna say here's the
part that's gonna annoy you okay
an adult's cartoon for me
has to be like 10 times more good
than a uh a live action show
for me to get over the animation hump
and it's ignorant
i can't i have nothing to say in my own
defense it's merely that like i feel
like i've seen
so many adult cartoons in my life that
like i'm just done
like i just roll my eyes right even
though i hear that bojack horseman is
incredible
like it i can't remember like the last
uh triple takes i don't know if strength
matters
like i i just i can't remember the last
time like
i opened up netflix and was like oh pog
an animated show for adults
i've seen like bob's burgers like i i've
had an okay time watching some bob's
burgers but
i don't know just i think i'm just out
of it like
i think the show is good but
so what i guess
i don't know i'm always like i'm having
like a pleasant time watching this like
i'm
modestly relaxed but it just doesn't get
the blood pumping you know
yeah not like something like rick and
morty something for intellectuals
dude i can't keep riding the lightning
here
our damage is good we got brimstone we
don't need to take
death's touch our hp is in a dangerous
spot what you do instead
is you re-roll and we take nothing and
we say
we say thank you we say thank you and we
move on
we're going to need some hp for whatever
the heck we're doing next
yeah exactly like bob's bro not bob's
brain bob's burgers is like it's pretty
good but it's
freaking how is it supposed to compete
with that hbo documentary about the life
of luciano pavarotti
i'm not joking either like tinted skull
real dad ours i mean i just think it's
remarkable like
you know the man he had a great voice he
lived
he lived a crazy life
isn't he gonna freeze himself
cheryl crows sang opera with pavarotti
once
look you know nobody's perfect
charge baby
you know h john benjamin is a great
voice for sure
why the animation negativity well it's i
don't know it's
honestly like the irrationality of it is
that it's just like
literally the most popular shows of well
it
literally is doing a lot of work there
the most popular shows
for my age group when i was growing up
were like cartoons but they say swears
sometimes
and i think i just literally from 2002
to 2009 that's like all i watched
and now i'm just kind of i'm just done
with it i like i want to see real human
beings now
um give me a re-roll you know what i'll
don't try that
excuse me can be in conception give us
incubus
let's go the baby let's go
and i will also say like i feel like
family guy really ruined it for the rest
of
the industry
like my my distaste
for family guy has made me not want to
watch
old simpsons futurama
like
i'm trying to get blood bag here even
though they're different shows it's like
it
it's like you know you ever like i think
some people out there they like ate
lettuce and got food poisoning and
they're like that's it i'm not even
gonna eat like arugula in the future
and i feel like that's like that's what
happened to me with
animation probably the 17th time that
peter griffin got in a fight with that
chicken
i was like i'm just i'm sorry i'm just
done
i think i'm out
it was the third time for me i remember
little brim baby
plus like i'm gonna watch like a lot of
cartoons
without a doubt as the baby gets older
like you know it's coming
i'm gonna be up to my freaking eyeballs
in cartoons i think uh
oh that's pretty good
dude this i don't know what happens once
we get past this next section but
i have seen a little paw patrol
like not not enough to form an opinion
on it because like i'm sure i'll see
enough to form an opinion eventually but
yeah yeah yeah it's for the baby exactly
i'm not trashing bojack horseman you
know i just said it didn't do it for me
i acknowledged that you know that
it's a very critically uh acclaimed show
that hurts or does it
it's just you know it's not for me
like you gotta remember like that's not
hp okay
you gotta remember if i was like hey you
know make sure to tune in to bloomberg
news canada on mondays
larry berman's always on at 8 a.m uh
pacific time he's got great in uh
insight as to what etfs are well
positioned right now
you probably tell me to shut up right
and i would just accept that because i'm
an adult
um but if i say like i don't really want
to watch bojack horseman people are like
i want you to die
it's like come on that's too far
i mean i get that bojack horseman is
like you know deals with mature issues
but like so does larry berman
on market call you know like what's
our canadian financial stocks well
positioned right now they got a lot of
cash in reserve
and presumably interest rates are going
to come up that's a mature discussion
let's let's go
i think we might we might get some
momentum here
yes but does he have a drinking problem
i wouldn't
prognosticate honestly like if he does
he keeps it outside of the scope of the
show
it's subtext
you should get the tinted skull as well
though
okay but why
okay hold on we definitely take we
definitely do not take
get into the habit that's fair that's a
good point
tinted skull tinted
skull
tinted just hold up it's tinted tinted
skull
brimstone bombs oh cause we got we got
weirdo bombs okay another fool car
oh right yeah cause we just blew up the
yeah yeah yeah i knew that
are you jerk
lemao under case lamount the the best
reaction you could
you can prompt from chat
he lamelled me jerry
he lamarred you he'll email me
not even we passed lol jerry
he laughed so hard his butt imagine
laughing so hard
a body part fell off
okay hold on it doesn't this part
doesn't matter okay
appreciate it keep it up proud of you
heavy re-rolls we don't need a second
one come on and then we just
uh do this
what the frick
okay i don't know what this is this is
new technology
have fun
joanna too yo we we slipped back into
the dark path
sick mundus okay
so cool cool yeah you know i'm i'm glad
i didn't take the deal with the devil
hp's a little spicy
be dead some of you guys only move when
i'm not
shooting and some of you only move when
i'm shooting
squeeze
send it man send it rune bag plus alges
is going to take us into the
stratosphere i'm ready for it
okay maybe don't go to the curse room
we got the wafer oh yeah this is doing
numbers
good book please oh baby
oh baby so there's bookworm
i think we definitely freaking at least
want to
use satanic bible it's probably good to
hold it as well
but on the other hand we could freaking
suck it up dude you're never gonna get a
you're never gonna get a suck
opportunity like this
you know what you take the satanic bible
you suck them up it was
actually not that good to begin with so
i'm glad we got some hp out of it
that's the play for sure uh
let's go
he could do it this is like
i mean isaac is a lot like dark souls
right like
if you give me a single enemy
the the other final boss not accepted
or accepted i should say um
i feel pretty okay if you give me a
large room with a bunch of little
marties on it that's where i
get frightened
get killed well they just make a button
you can step on
and it kills all the enemies
i thought this game was supposed to be
weren't people complaining this is
too hard
[Laughter]
tooth and nail you feel prickly maybe we
do contact damage to enemies or
something
i don't know great item trash item
of course well the thing is we don't
really need the coupon
so i think we'll just take tarot cloth
i guess i guess if you take coupon into
the devil deal
you could get uh the boss item
for free
i'm i keep turning gold
i keep i keep turning into a statue
there will be no deals anymore oh come
on man not even from the boss
oh cause i got spikes when i stand still
maybe i don't know
hold up hold up hey
the generosity knows no bounds golden
razor has appeared in the basement
yo tarot cloth is going to be sick here
too
spikes give you immunity from demon
judgment
i'm kind of kind of scared though
oh we have the wafer we can do it like
this because i don't know what how to
trigger the spikes
just take it i'm not a coward shot speed
up that's pretty much game winning
thank you they come and go every five
seconds
who do they think they are things from
sufjan steven's most popular song
chicago
bret okay hold on
give me some red hearts please
try just try it i don't know what i
don't know what that means
to to to play us out what does that mean
waiting for the spikes to go to go away
i don't know what it means
don't hold on okay every five seconds
okay we get
okay and then you get one play on him
every five seconds okay you know what
now that i thought about it for two
seconds that makes sense
isn't that going to take 1 000 years
though
that's too much time this like i don't
know man that's like
15 times the average human lifespan
i still took damage was i just too slow
appear to still you trolled me oh you
[Laughter]
you got me
no when when you get me that good that's
not like
an occasion to ban that's an occasion to
they should be
made a saint the saint of trolling
saint stevo okay
it's at least some demon hearts i'm not
too mad about that
a little trolling's okay yeah i don't

cuphead as well
some cuphead-esque elements here just
dodge the bullets for him
my god he's good okay what first
horseman of the apocalypse no problem
dude it's just contra yo it's
a little bit of aladdin on the genesis
vibe here huh
it's pretty sick what happens if you
can't fly here surely they give you
flight right
and i'm not talking about irish spring
green green green
they give you flight okay well as far as
i'm concerned they should give me super
flight then because i had it in advance
oh they show you in the cutscene yeah
that's a good point that's a good point
you just fall in the larva
he grew wings in the cutscene oh is that
cannon i didn't know
don't tell kathleen kennedy

here
use your bombs
well dude that is actually pretty sick
yo whatever you do to the bombs they get
like multiplied by the lava
oh no i have scatter bombs oh you're in
a world of hurt
i think it's fair to say this is a very
instructive run
we're learning a lot
just juggle them just juggle them i
don't want it dude dude
oh i gotta leave one
i imagine if you kept them going the
whole way though super meat boy
keep shooting pick your moments
now it's aladdin
you're gonna oh okay okay okay
just make sure you keep shooting you
know you get the dodging down and you do
the shooting
you get the dodging down you get you do
the shooting he's gonna spit them all
out okay you should not have stood there
it's just super hexagon okay you should
probably stay up on that one huh
you're gonna chase me back the other way
you son of a gun
i knew it
i'm pretty stoked we ended up getting
the strongest run of all time
i'm also very stoked that chad told me
to take satanic bible
were it not for that i feel like uh
i feel like life would have been pretty
tough that is awesome though
this is like you know if you've ever
complained about the late game bosses in
previous isaac's just being like
incredibly
tanky like you know snoozes not
not my words but other people's words
less discerning customers
this is me
this is a a total inversion
of the of the formula i think he's dead
man
then suddenly the sky above cracked open
and a white beam of light reached down
that's me
smiting the mother of harlots asunder
and setting the blood lake
to a boil as the beast descended down
into the lake of fire
isaac ascended towards the crack in the
sky and as he flew he could see echoes
of his past before him
he saw his mother mourning the loss of
her son
he saw his father leaving them without
turning to say goodbye
he saw his mother sleeping and his
father taking
money from her purse he heard the
late-night
fights they had that kept him up at
night and the guilt he felt for what he
believed he was causing
he felt the pain in his stomach during
those sleepless nights
found himself in a hotel room closet
waiting for him
as he rose he felt his fears drop from
his body
his shame his worry pulled from his
being
as he became lighter his ascent became
faster he saw his one true companion
alive and well he saw his mother and
father together again
holding each other he felt his mother
kissing him on the head after he had
said his prayers
and the comfort in knowing someone was
watching over him
he saw his own birth and the faces of
his parents
filled with joy and optimism
and then he saw nothing
are you sure this is how you want this
story to end isaac
you're the one writing it it doesn't
have to end this way
here sans how about we tell it a
different way
maybe a happy ending okay daddy
good are you getting sleepy yet
yeah okay so
isaac and his parents lived in a small
house on the top
a happy ending they fight they've
revealed the
it was a all a game within a game
that's a nice positive way to kind of
leave it
until until the song
i gotta wait for the the netflix
original series to understand
is this what i sound like when i sing
yeah plus uh i just killed the devil on
easter so
get owned satan
believers win again
well they say h-e-l-l
options question mark
what the what the heck
