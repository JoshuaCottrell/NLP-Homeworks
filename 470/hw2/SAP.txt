hey everybody i'm happy to report my
death wait the reports of my death in
super auto pets beta are um
highly exaggerated i had an off camera
run last night on on my day off
where i uh got to nine wins i didn't get
to ten what was the crux of that
uh it was a hold on hold on hold on this
is an okay start
the the crux of it
as we roll through here
sure we could run two two three fish
combine them aft after that but we'll be
the um
dude give me let me be the hungry
clementines it's a decent name um it
could be a youtube channel in 2011.
uh
i think we might lose early here
we'll see i don't i don't know we'll
we'll we'll see that's all i'm gonna say
because we trade here
and then we trade uh we we trade here
and then we trade okay so the illegal
bagels good game good game
um
it was uh an ox
we got an ox early or sorry a bison
when you buy a friend get plus one plus
one
that was uh that was a big part of it
for us
uh and then we just bought a lot of
friends quite frankly it went a little
bit like that this is a weird squad to
start with i would never
i would never suggest otherwise
but we can definitely get like the idea
is we're gonna make our our level three
fish that'll give us a level two unit
this looks bad
the squeaky pencils um that'll give us a
level two unit
let's go that level two unit um
i don't know it'll do something
we definitely lose this one that level
two unit can get buffed by both beavers
i guess is what i'm trying to say
you just had a better squad there i'll
give that one up to you but here comes
the scaling
you'll be ashamed of your words and your
deeds when the scaling approaches here
i think we can totally roll a dog
start like this
in turn
if you save some gold you scale
this is a fairly early scaling maybe
maybe it beats the dog
as long as we keep our finances okay
and then there's a part of me that's
like just hold up a second here
i don't know a 2-4 cricket
i think we sell
i think we sell
that's not what we want to see obviously
but then we sell
our two our two lads get buffed we might
only be able to roll yeah because we
want to get the buff here we're only
going to roll two units
which means i i think you probably don't
take a fish i think you roll once more
i mean i'm just gonna level with you a
flamingo and then a frozen sleeping pill
two or more gold and then another beaver
like this is
we can roll one more time
this is actually like really bad i i
think i did a not good job
but i would settle i'm getting a little
too deep into novel strategy
um
i'm i'm
skeptical let's put it that way
because we are gonna die here
and then yeah this is another loss and
and quite frankly we deserve for this to
be a loss but all is not lost yet
because the puppy still scales we just
we did things poorly with our
mathematics there okay
so
we definitely we love this
that's a permanent buff
that's a permanent buff
we have 10 we would like to buy three
units
are you kidding me man
why are our units so bad
i mean okay i
i guess i keep the money
i'm i'm not thrilled about this uh
look if we're not are we getting we are
getting the buff yeah okay dude i don't
know this one might be i i i'm trying
look people have been on me for a couple
of things one of them is pivoting from
strategies too quickly the other one is
always trying to shoehorn the same
builds
this one we're trying to roll a
different build so i hope you i hope you
respect it i hope you enjoy it uh i i
certainly am a little bit frightened uh
against the the fatherly eruptions here
but look at that we're actually gonna
pull out a win
um undeserved i would say against uh
someone that had a 25 bird stacked up
but okay
now maybe slow your roll a touch here
livable i can live with that we do it
the dog is kind of popping okay
now we need to buy two units which means
we can spend
nine gold total roll me see what you get
you see if you see something you like
take it
i think because we're investing in like
a scaling build i don't mind this i also
think a turtle
plus like a
a sleeping pill is a really easy way for
us to get
some cheap melon armor out here
eventually so i don't mind this
roll me once freeze uh well actually
okay no freeze me the pill
and we we can roll one more time we
could use the pill but then we wouldn't
have another unit here
and i think this is important
i don't want to just roll
uh no one's probably good i don't want
to just roll bat
and peacock every time puffer fish can
be pretty good we don't really have a
synergy yet let's just freeze the puffer
fish because it is a level two a level
three unit and we have a lot of flexible
positions to put these uh units right
here
it's a scary squad at least it's only a
level one bat
that's probably the worst outcome
um
this this ladybug is gonna kill our
whole freaking squad um
we
we win
wow that was unexpected and the puppy's
still scaling we're trying to get like
if we can get it leveled up that would
be beautiful of course um so
i mean do we i think we we like our fish
more than the turtle for now for for
buffing purposes so let's kill the
flamingo
then we're going to swap them back are
we going to roll a blowfish here
i mean a swan is nice for economy but
it's a level it's a tier two unit on you
know games uh turned six here we are two
two somehow which is amazing to me i
don't think i need to tell you that
um let's roll i know
you're like why roll
when you have uh
a unit you might want
and i there's a there's a case to be
made there
hear me out
i want the puppy to get buffed it is
nice when it has melon armor though i
don't know at least we're getting the
scaling like it is an 11 14 11 15 that's
pretty spicy tropical fish and puffer
fish have some synergy but i feel like
we're scaling way too slow
i hate seeing a peacock early man
turtle week doesn't matter
so this is bad
and then this is bad again
um and then this is uh
a draw which wait it's a win which is
stunning to me i have no concept of how
we're actually pulling out wins here
with no synergy but one thing's for sure
a draw is a is a win-ish when you have
scaling
um to then get even better i mean i
guess we just have decent stats is
really what it comes down to so let's
let's get you pumping
we definitely want to
freeze we can roll one more time
we definitely want to freeze we're still
scaling the puppy is like our our whole
game plan revolves around this puppy
right now we want to see no bats we want
to see no strong units at the front
very we see a bat we see a strong unit
at the front we see a peacock our
strongest unit got uh hurt
and then hurt again
but not one more time let's go that's
huge
as huge as it could be
okay so we busted your melon armor at
least
i think this is uh
i think this is another win
it's so stupid
we do not deserve to be in the position
we're in right now um
and yet here we are so
give me that give me that plus two buff
um
i th the the turtle has done a lot of
good for us okay
and yet in spite of that i i do think
there's a case to be made you sell the
fish so you got the space to buy the cow
we're already getting a nice buff on the
puppy so we're not sweating that and
then i think for three we can roll once
just see what you get
and this is fine we can then spend
another three to buff this to an 812 but
it'll actually be an 814 and our puppy
is going to be a
15 22.
now we've got a synergy we're kind of
working on very nice squad level too bad
means we lose probably just just own it
at least it didn't hit our dog
this is all pretty standard really
that's important this is nice
it's nice
um it's a draw
but that's okay no it's a win because of
the mel armor
we should not be at five wins two losses
in my opinion but maybe maybe it just
goes to show you i don't know
anything about this game i guess
um
well we can definitely sell
buy
and that's like a pretty important
improvement i think we freeze a cow roll
again we're just seeing if we can't uh
get a little bit
more juice and more squeeze you know
what i mean
no that's fairly typical i understand
now we could sell like the cow and buy a
deer
but there is a part of me that's like
you know for right now if it ain't broke
don't fix it why not roll once
i do think garlic armor on the puppy is
going to be important let's not worry
about it right now just because of
scaling and a rooster can scale pretty
nicely but i think we roll again
do we roll one more time
i regret it just to be
level two tropical fish is okay maybe
we'll freeze to go for a level three
just in case but
and
probably we want to have our dog get
buffed by the turtle
um but then we also want the or to get
the melon armor from the turtle but then
we also want
the tropical fish to buff the units
that's already buffing
i mean this is my perfect like if it
ain't broke don't fix a moment where
like right now we're we're actually just
cruising thanks to this incredible
blowfish that isn't even a level two yet
um so i'm i'm feeling pretty good man
like i i don't i don't know what you
would nickname this synergy it's kind of
like in tetris how you would like
pretend to be bad
and then just pop off
um
so this buffalo is what
like ran wild for me last time but i got
it on like turn four instead of turned
ten so i think that makes a big
difference
i think garlic on the puppy is pretty
big we'll roll once
we don't have a level three friend we
may get one we don't have one yet
chicken buffs all future shop animals
we're not gonna be buying too many tier
ones though i think this is another roll
and we're kind of stuck with this squad
for now
um
a little late for the scaling but i i'm
just being honest with you i don't love
this shop what i do love is is
constantly buffing
our puppy and our blowfish if they get
through the puppy which they could
easily do just by having a nice bat hit
like this is horrible for us but
that's not so bad honestly i i can live
with it
although it would have kept us alive
there which would have been pretty sick
the puppy still does some incredible
work
we make it
we make it
we win again i i i can't believe it
because like my cow doesn't do anything
like it it was just there to give us
milk like three turns ago and yet here
we are at seven wins
what the frick although if you'll excuse
me i have i have a message okay where
it's good it's we're in a good spot um
now a t-rex if you have three or more
gold
buff all friends so this is a synergy
that works with our existing gold
synergy
we should probably buy this first we
should probably buy this this will put
us on five
this will put us on
oh but you need three or more gold
not just two or more gold
i'm sorry
my my turtle friend
you've done great work for me and i'm
slapping you in the face here
but i i that's my miss but you know what
we got the can out of that that which is
fine i think it's okay so we basically
got a a three-tier squad up at the front
once they die it's over that's probably
ideal weakness for us so i'm very
pleased
very pleased
i'm acceptably pleased
that's fine
that's wonderful wow this was like an
accidentally insanely easy win
we're at
eight wins and two losses which is again
surprising to me
um
there is a part of me that's like hey
you're a 7 10
and every time you eat food
you're gonna buff
random friends with plus one plus one
i still feel like we need that level two
blowfish we do need something
though like
freeze me a salad for now
no freeze me a garlic
i don't know do you count as food maybe
maybe we'll buy a sushi
which gives us a nice
double buff
followed by
another nice buff
i don't know we do i mean i know the
stats top out at 50 50 okay so like our
dogs getting pretty close to
uh or our puppy i should say is getting
pretty close to maximum
health at least
we have all friends plus four plus four
huh
i'm stunned that we're doing this with a
level one puppy
uh and like a tropical fish
we're so lucky dude
like we don't quite finish the job here
but to not die in the first shot against
their
puppy the moody streamers excuse me as
we go to nine wins
dude i'm i'm freaking out
um
i don't mind giving you a cupcake man
roll me
juice me
freeze me
buff me this could be it this could be
10 wins on camera
uh which we've done on stream before but
like with coaching from chat
let's see this it's a nasty looking
squad with a level 2 bat level 3 turtle
is horrible as well
because we're gonna that's gonna be
meloned up
this one's gonna be tight
no it's not we're gonna lose that's fine
that's fine we still got one more to
play with
level three turtle is nasty that's the
revenge of franklin the turtle that we
gave up
um
we could actually roll franklin again
actually we could easily create melon
armor do we care for that i don't know
and start there
freeze me a turtle just in case roll me
don't don't freeze me the pill i don't
care
roll me once more
roll me once more
i'm not really looking for the buff on
this one i'm looking to level up
i mean
it's a nice buy on the snail don't get
me wrong the problem is like
you know you're getting
plus two plus one on everyone at the
expense of uh plus two plus two on
everyone
okay so i think we maybe we were looking
for the buff now remember we could draw
here
so if we're gonna draw here we do want
to keep uh we do want to keep scaling
i'm hoping we just ran into like the
ultimate nasty squad last time and this
time we're gonna freaking blow him away
uh
garlic armor doesn't help us here level
two bad
that's nasty
this is terrible
we're going to lose
[Laughter]
well life comes at you fast okay that's
still i mean i'm not upset that's a nine
win it was like two two losses nine wins
two losses very heavily bookended
i think you just roll this squad right
off the bat
the pigs sell nicely
beetles do get strong i don't mind
freezing like one of those
i'll be the inedible mushrooms
so this is that's a decent name imo
i'm very pleased with our first run a
nine and four is is good eats
the running eruptions
that's nasty
that's that's a loss right there that
what a squad man it just goes to show
you how powerful like an ant is if you
get it in your first shop you might want
to re-roll
until you get an ant quite frankly
at least up to a certain point
so we're basically we're at 13 gold
i think you can sell
sell
buy
roll
and then you're forced to buy out the
shop
but the shop buyout is actually like
pretty okay here i i think we got
reasonably lucky
next turn
we'll combine all our fish
and and get the plus one plus one on
everybody that we can a fish the stats
on a fish are acceptable for scaling
uh don't hit my board you've hit my
board
which means this is worse than a trade
but our next trade
is
no it's not because you're a 2-2 that's
a trade
this is better than a trade i think we
draw
but again we scale so we like a draw not
as much as a win but more than a you
know a loss two losses early is nasty
not that you can't make it out of it
like we did last time
here's what i think you do this
we would like a
i'm just going to level with you a 3-4
is pretty nasty early on
um
i know this is like how we've rolled for
a while here is the peacock
and the peacock kind of gets blown out
by
a bat
maybe we could actually roll
dog but then there's no horse really
but if we
on combination we get a new unit right
and the unit will be a chick here which
would give
five five
i think we don't mind like i don't mind
the fish getting buffed for now and
we'll give the five five well honestly
now i'm like forget
the long term in the short term
a 610 peacock is gonna like it it should
get us some security
considering we're on round three this is
a pretty sizable advantage for us i
think although we're going to trade with
that ladybug up at the front that's
pretty nasty
but then we're also going to trade with
this bird and then we're also going to
trade here
and then we're going to smoke you
and then we're going to we're going to
trade
but we scaled okay we're not in a lobby
with these individuals it's asynchronous
so that's okay i'm not i'm not too
worried about it right now um
a pill i think we don't sweat it
do we want i mean
why not we're only two fish away from a
plus two plus two on everyone
now what is the weak link right now the
peacock could use a buff that's
in fact i think that that's good enough
even though we want garlic on them
eventually
um
i think this is the squad you roll with
so i think we actually just do this
i still believe in the what is
essentially an 11 10 peacock up here if
it doesn't die on the first hit we're
loving life now i see a 2-1 and i'm a
very happy camper
owns
owns this is this is what we're looking
for
a powerful peacock early but
what i like about this squad right now
okay we just picked up a win the other
thing i like about the squad though is
that every unit that we have here i
don't mind like kicking to the curb i
don't mind seeing them
you know
i don't mind seeing them vacate
i don't think we need the garlic quite
yet
now i gotta tell ya
i do love uh
i do love a bat
to create some weakness
i think a bat
is
it's good for the weakness but it's
really good because weakness replaces
whatever like equipment they have
so i i don't really want to get rid of
the bird it's nice scaling i don't
really want to get rid of the chick or
the peacock they're kind of a package
deal so it's really fish or beetle let's
sell the beetle though it brings me no
pleasure
and i think i'm still happy buffing the
fish instead of buffing the bat for the
time being
garlic on the fish like look
this is uh an investment in the future
it's not an investment in the in the
present
swans pretty good too don't get me wrong
uh but
i i'm coming to terms with the fact that
sometimes it's okay to buy to help
yourself out early
instead of always trying to buy
uh to help yourself out later you know
like sometimes there isn't a later for
you to worry about
this um
this is a loss which is fine
that takes us to two losses or three
losses two losses that's not we still
got room to work with we got room to
play
they got ball players too this is a buy
it's a buy
you know me i don't disrespect the uh
i don't disrespect the turtle it's just
like there's there's nothing really on
the squad that i look at and i say melon
armor is the way you got to go here this
would be a nice win we're so close to
hitting some level twos and then just
sticking with them for a bit
not a big deal buff the deer please
not ideal
one five five bus sucks to lose your
your chick at the back there but it is
what it is we trade peacocks
i think we we draw i think this is
another draw we're built on draws here
but again we get a limited amount of
scaling
every time so there's there's something
alike there
roll me once we're looking for
okay you know what a buffalo can scale
out of its
freaking gourd here
it's only a five five for now but it can
get better
so now you wish to buy friends whenever
possible
which means freeze this roll this
this is not our puppy built are we okay
losing something here like if we were
gonna lose something are you really okay
selling your fish
i'm gonna go local man do i i like this
bed do i like this bed
i like this bed sell the fish where this
is called an investment sweetheart i
wouldn't expect you to understand
you were the back
all of a sudden now you're a six six
the turtle can play in the late game
freeze me freeze me
unfreeze me freeze me roll me
now this to just draw this one would be
incredible and then we start pulling out
of this pit
at least you're only a level one thank
thank the lord above
that's it's pretty bad i'm not gonna
deny that okay
but at least the blowfish oh it's not
gonna die oh it is gonna die if blowfish
dies in one hit we trade
we win because of melon armor that's a
dream man melon armor does counter bad
as well so this this win is super
important for us because now we got some
scaling built in
um this is
huge
this is
big
every time we buy a friend you get plus
two plus two
i don't really wanna dump that turtle
though i'm just gonna level with you
roll me once more
we kind of need to scale you to the moon
but you know what i'm going to do you
actually know what i'm going to do first
i'm going to buy a garlic but i do want
the canned food for later
i think we can now recognize i don't
want to pivot off of the strategies but
we got like one more
or two more shops
before it really gets so nasty this is
these bats man i mean i know i have a
bat but still like come on
you
peace actually you know what that means
at least our our chick does get to do
some damage but then we do okay so this
is a loss
um
which is fine again like we have the
scaling all is not lost as a result of
this but i think we got to put
we got to put some serious respect on
the bison's name
and the the turtles probably got to go
i think you can sell a peacock
to buy a rhino we should buy a can first
maybe
maybe maybe buy two cans but freeze me
for the future
freeze me for the future
uh sorry i'm into roll
um
we we actually i guess we don't really
want your garlic armor to replace
they get replaced by melon armor let's
let's have i know you're scaling as well
i'm just scared okay i'm i'm really
scared right now um buy food gain gold
we don't really have a food build so
roll me once more
we don't have a level three friend i'm
okay with this i mean this is what it's
all about right here
we have a 12 13 rhino up at the front
that could
just go infinite if we get lucky
lucky start although we do have a
cheetah or a leopard
turtle lives
double weakness
this is gonna be hard
wait no it's not lucky me
and then we got mel and armor for no
reason but at least that gives us a win
okay
so we're up to 3-3
and so much of this really does come
down to
like okay you know what this means this
means we don't need a turtle
which means we can sell turtle
get the plus two plus two roll it over
now you're a 14-14
anything else we really want here not
for the time being if you see a pig you
pretty much gotta buy it just keep that
in mind
i mean i think for now there's no reason
we can't roll a seal
i know you're gonna be like get some
cans i'm really investing in this
in this water buffalo right now if
you'll if you'll forgive me um
it's a weird setup okay i would never
suggest that it's not why don't you sell
this
buy this
now you're in 1818 put you up at the
front we don't wish to buff you roll me
one more time
um
at this point would we sell a deer to
get a turtle no will we sell a deer to
get an eagle possibly
that 1213 rhino is very interesting to
me we're building something unusual okay
that doesn't bother me
where's my weakness
i like to see it
okay now you got a five five deer it's
doing something not a lot but it's doing
something this is terrible
um
this is it's gotta be a loss yeah okay
well you know we had a nine win and a
three win that's a 12-8 run i'm not
upset i hope you enjoyed it if you did

welcome back to super auto pets a lot of
people asking how's the crash bandicoot
nft doing it's doing really well
uh he's still
he hasn't
diminished any further
he's still broken but he's not any more
broken than he was yesterday so as long
as you
weathered yesterday's emotional storm
you should be okay today a lot of people
also wondering
why my glasses sit so high on my on my
face and obscure my eyebrows look okay i
i can
i need to get them adjusted a little bit
okay and i recognize that the light look
i didn't try the glasses on in my office
before you know hold on one second here
just give me a moment
hold on i didn't even consider this man
i'm wondering what this is going to do
to my
equilibrium
whoa
that's weird
that's
everything just looks a little
a little different
a little off
i feel like like things are slightly
further away
oh man
my brain is like excuse me i just got
used to those other ones
okay we'll put this sorry youtube sorry
i'm just letting you know okay
i need to get them
i need to get these glasses adjusted a
little bit i need to get them to to sit
slightly lower so my eyebrows still pop
out
otherwise it's all good we're here for
the gameplay we're on free to play deck
still
um and and we're on you know what
dude hold on settings
can i son of a i don't want people to
know
that i'm pay to win
that that is annoying for me
i i want to
i want to sneak
like with the default background and
then crush them with like the the
the bat and stuff like that but anyway
okay you you know you buy a duck she
said let's hit the parking lot so i can
sick your duck
you know you're buying a beaver we don't
care for a cricket that much we'd love
to see an ant on a re-roll fish is okay
but i'll be honest i think i think a
double duck
puts you in a situation where
we expect
dude this fish could freaking pop too we
expect this
that the will be the the the chunky
buttocks we expect this to
be a loss round one but that's okay i
think we can use it as a springboard
into several wins
i think this is mathematically
guaranteed to be a draw we have
essentially the same squad
we got lucky snowman god the illegal
shovels
okay now
this is where you just chill okay
sell cell takes us to 12.
are we re are we willing to roll
a four
squad marty
we could sell one
i think i'm willing i think i'm willing
to sell man
i kind of want to re-roll once first
though if we're only able to buy two
anyway i don't well this buy is not bad
hmm
i think i roll
i think i roll one time
nine
then you get to
eleven you buy three
sell me
what
we're okay
we're okay
i've never seen that before i got so
scared
sell me
juice me
dude you don't wanna round two you roll
up against this squad cancel christmas
roll me
freeze me
roll me
freeze me okay so we're going to get a
tier 3 next turn i might even say you
can't freeze the whole shop because you
need one to be open that dub ant build
though oh man
look at this
okay two two we don't care oh okay very
great minds think alike
good trade
this is an amazing setup for us we got
super lucky all of the math has worked
out in exactly our favor
we will win this round
good win the gasping buttocks lose to
the chunky buttocks
now you just think for a moment okay
you think for a moment i'm hanging by a
moment here with you
you
combine
sell
oh baby
bye
we did not lose our last battle you
peace
that's an f man that's an f
now i'm thinking
why not get another ants maybe we could
make a level three ant at some point
either way this is pillable and thus
killable
i'm gonna freeze the snail we're gonna
roll
you know what
why not
why not copy health from the friend
ahead
why not freeze
juice and squeeze freeze me
i'm gonna level with you man
we're not gonna be rolling a crab long
term
so pig only costs us one gold
i feel like we maybe just roll pig just
for oh but then you go unfreeze the crab
man what do you do with that crab up
there
minor mistake okay
not a huge deal yet not a huge problem
this is where it gets interesting okay
we got us okay this is pretty good
we do get a favorable series of trades
right here
i mean you can't beat that fish man
this guy's name is really xx alt
lover 24 huh
i don't even know what to say
it's just a great name
it's just it's just a great name you
sell the pig that's a gimme
get that gold back peel the ants
we got eight seven level two ant that's
going nowhere man
roll me
i like a dodo
is we we kind of need to roll once
though to get like some superior units
this is not great okay like these are
this is not the squad we want we're
buying you for econ again we're buying
the shop out is what we're gonna do
right here
i don't know what you do with a freaking
dodo man like i guess
just put that son of a gun on him well i
guess we'll put it on the ant for now
i can't afford to dump an eight seven
ants
don't get that dunk
this three mosquitoes scares me
but we lived
and you know what that didn't go so
badly
camel's gonna make one nasty mosquito
here no doubt about that we're gonna our
ant trades which is terrible news
our dodo trades which is terrible news
and then we lose because your cricket's
gonna spawn a one-one cricket okay fair
enough
well played
umbuna well played
selmy
i'm gonna be honest i think you buy a
fish
in the hopes
that you can create a level three fish
level two fish and get a level four unit
rabbit's interesting but i'm gonna roll
once i'm gonna get a little spicy
dude i gotta
release as a level one so if i release
this ant as a level one what
happens
is it gonna be a level one eight seven
so it'll give us the double buff
it'll it'll be a two one and i can't do
that man
i can't do that
it does give the double buff don't get
me wrong but
i i think this is not the whale's time
to shine
there is a chance of wario today okay
don't i i know you're like yeah i've
heard that one before last time i heard
that when i fell off my dinosaur i
promise you there is a chance
of wario
and i'm not saying that for like you
know just being a memer
so we def we know we want dodos here
okay but we don't want to create a a
next tier unit yet so we want to freeze
a dodo
i'll be honest with you i kind of feel
like we want to freeze two dodos
sell a mosquito
buy a ram and the ram can fit there
we want the flamingo the flamingo buff
in the ram the rams likely to stick
around the dodo is likely to stick
around
it in fact i would say very likely to
stick around roll me we're looking to
maybe freeze a pill
swan was was curious
we'll freeze it for now
actually that pill is sick man okay
just if our flamingo trades it's not
gonna trade
this okay horse is gonna be very scary
here i think this is a loss
this is this is oh my god you got a
kangaroo out of it man that's like this
pretty top tier
this is a tough one to pull out of
at least the dodo kills the kangaroo
our ant lives
our ant
dies
the turtle oh but the turtle's gonna
give melon armor but the melon armor is
gonna replace
the the meat which means we
lose okay
because it's a ram okay for a second
there i thought i was i got a little
ahead of myself okay
now this is where this is how i pog
get owned
get owned
get owned
i feel like you kind of gotta take a
level
a level four unit
here does five yeah this seems like a
great snipe early on this seems like a
great sniper
dare i say okay
so i'm feeling like you put dolphin
beret out there
you got six hp for me why don't we make
you an 86 temporarily
we should get some wins here we should
get some some wind enablers okay
that horse please get the horse please
what the you peace
they got the same squad man
you peace
this seems bad
it seems like we draw lucky lucky lucky
dodo buffs oh above's two ahead at level
two thank you thank you for the
intelligence
i was not thinking straight
it's it's very simple you you now pivot
from whatever you have to get hippo
garlic going
hippo garlic dodo is like it's insane
it's not even it's not even up for
debate
so
the fish has no reason to exist nor does
the ant nor does the sheep really but we
can start
like that like that that's the give me
probably should have got the can first
now the ant needs to come before
something
we can do it like that because we want
to make sure you guys get the buffs
that seems fine
freeze me
roll me
destroy the sheep
purchase a monkey
to scale
the hippo
freeze me squeeze me
it's gonna be a 10-9
garlic armor hippo
you peace it's all right we got garlic
armor
we live through the ants let's go get
sniped
yunka yunka thanks for the trade
we do have a spider level two a four
four guess what
get owned we win okay now and then and
the hippo gets better and better thanks
to this monkey over time man
that's good stuff okay so we're two two
two three two three two him me him him
me
the can is the easy buy
okay
we know we want this
we're very confident we want this but
let's roll once first just to see
dude i okay the penguin is pretty sick
actually a freaking dodo is pog city
holy crap
get the dodo we're gonna get a level
three dodo in a second here
at some point you're probably gonna dump
an ants or a dolphin really to pick up a
penguin
so i like where we're at here you freeze
them both
as long as the dolphin's still getting
snipes
it's gonna hit a camel here which is not
good but
never mind i can't do math
oh you're so lucky
sorry this hippo it just needs some
scaling
you're lucky yet again
okay you you know what you've gotten
some great mathematics here
we still i think we we draw it's a
neutral draw
the ant is going to go
you might as well do it now
pog city
[Laughter]
okay yeah yeah
a 10 10 dodo
it's only you're only buffing the dodo
right now
but i'm okay with that
i also feel
like the next step
is you you might as well buy a chili
pepper and put it on the dodo
so at least it gets something done
this this
hippo just needs
level two or a tiger or something you're
sniping my penguin literally nobody
cares i'm sniping your bird literally
nobody cares oh you got it you got a
level two dolphin or uh i don't know
what happened there
okay
very
clever very clever
yeah okay you still i understand you've
still got melon armor i still punch
through your melon armor because i'm
amazing look at that
that's a victory we're up to 4-2 oh the
parrot did the dolphin thing that makes
sense okay i mean this is easy right you
level up you might be replacing your
dolphin with something better here
a tiger for example a tiger for example
i'm like
tiger behind dodo
creates a a freaking nightmare situation
for them so you said don't desync me you
piece it
then we move monkey up
tiger behind dodo
holy crap
honestly like the rhino would fit super
nicely here
as well
i'm liking the scaling though i i think
we can wait for this pivot for a sec and
i hope i'm not wrong about that
this is big that's that's a freeze for
now i don't think we can this
roll me
okay fair enough
tiger in front
yeah tiger in front would be like really
good so that it
casts uh is passive on nobody also
people are saying tiger monkey okay
it says in battle this caused a huge
argument yesterday because people were
like the tiger works with the monkey
then someone on the subreddit was like
it worked it did plus four plus four but
it was it did plus four plus four
because it was a level two monkey that
does plus two plus four plus four
it doesn't work on the monkey
imo
oh what a buff man
it didn't work
go check the vod
here comes the yummy yummy
oh
my god
oh my god we're still living
not oh we're still living
we're still living
this time you're gonna get me but that's
oh but i'm gonna get you because your
melon armor only blocks 20 anyway
okay okay
uh get owned uh get double loans
body the clean feet
better
you gotta man i mean you gotta
even if it buffs one more level you
gotta
three friends ahead
dude i got a level with you
if you get a snake
behind a hippo that's pogging out of
control like it's over
i think the penguin is not long for this
world it's nice that it buffs the dodo
but that's and the monkey i guess but
that's not a big deal the penguin goes
the tiger
still goes
behind the dodo the scaling is too
incredible
so we need you at the back then
and then the snake
right there
and we're looking to get like a rooster
or something i i couldn't agree more
there i think a rooster is going to be a
big play
i'm just thinking
i'm just thinking okay
call me crazy i don't think we're gonna
need a a
a stake on the snake because the snake
is already gonna hit
four
freaking
34 damage
stake on the tiger
maybe gets us out of a little jam
then we can invest in some rolls
level 2 hippo
the scaling is gonna be freaking crazy
i don't even know what to say about the
parrot man
leopard dude we're getting such an
incredible value out of the
out of the dodo tiger and people are
like they're they're already like get
rid of it like we we don't like it
anymore
yeah we'll get ready to not like this
i'm a little scared of what this
turkey's gonna do
lord i've seen what you've done for a
turkey and i want you to do it for me as
well no no you know why
because
we're gonna kill the turkey with our
snake
now we're gonna we're gonna run into
some problems with splashing attacks
but it is what it is
our hippo still lives that's so stupid
and hilarious
okay the bus will kill us
but i mean come on you're already dead
fart smeller
what a name
so there's a few things we want
one of them is hp on uh our hippo and hp
on the snake really as well
no it's not the right time
um
you're gonna laugh but i think pear on
snake
to bust through splash damage
because we're already getting 4 4 on the
hippo every turn
i think you i think you try to make sure
the snake can survive splash damage and
snipes a little bit better
this is a freeze and a half
this is a buy
and then we we send it again
what the only thing we're worried about
right now is that the the hippo gets hit
by a stronger enemy rate at the start
that's the worst
okay i see how this goes your snake is
gonna live for a long time
it would be nice if we sniped it
your worm's not gonna get as strong as
you thought it would
we are going to live through this
which is hilarious
thank you for not hitting my hippo
all right
it's another win another good one now
keep in mind
the snakes still chunk in here
because we're about to level it up
which created a mammoth now the snake
does 10 damage to an enemy behind so
there's a part of me that's like
tiger behind snake is pretty sick
but there's also a part of me that's
like
giving 26
extra hp to uh or 26 extra damage to the
hippo has done a lot of work for us i
think we can always do this in the late
game
and we're not going to be replacing many
more animals
so i think that we roll
and i think we buy
and i think we buff
i am gonna this time you know it's only
one one but i'm gonna buff the hippo
the monkey is is replaceable soon you're
not wrong
very similar build we got here
my hippo has died
that's no good
but we lived through that thankfully
level three ram
this is why we're happy we got the stake
on the tiger that was scary
that was a scary situation
again i think we go hard
roll me once
you could chili the snake but
we got to think about this
i know i know you're going to say okay
and it's possible you're right but the
the plus 4 plus 4 still matters you
could sell
monkey for cow then you get the cow
you put two milk on you guess what you
get plus four plus four once then you
sell again to buy like a turtle not to
play not the play
instead
roll me
freeze me
juice me
roll me
it's not a freeze here this is a good
freeze this is my ideal shop
freeze me
and get ready to eat me
level three hippo
is gonna gain
six
defense every time it kills an enemy
this squad is a joke sorry i didn't mean
to say that
this squad is really good
get him
actually you know what we might draw
fair enough this is not a joke not a
joke
get him
get him
you know there's a part of me that's
like you sell the monkey and then you
just roll a second tiger behind the
snake
and then you still get the benefit of
the dodo
that's that's really
funny and because we lost the monkey
we're gonna start spending on some
some buffs here that's hilarious man
melon armor very smart melon armor very
smart
unfortunately i still think we kill you
even with your melon armor
oh
sorry bus
i mean what can you say about this like
oh no no no no no no
oh no no no no no
all right good good win good win there
so we are probably reaching a point
where
we don't
the dodo doesn't benefit
the hippo that much anymore but it still
benefits our snake
i don't a salad i disrespect i roll roll
me and look for a rooster
rooster exists in
in free-to-play right
that's not a a non-free to play marty
past 50 the hippo won't actually heal at
all
uh excuse me while i say you peace
okay we'll we'll try some pizza
as long as the snake gets it i'm happy
honestly you know what
toss me another salad i know i just i i
spent the salad re-rolling but
15 15 chili pepper
with it with a level two dodo
that's that's bad in case of draw
but otherwise not that bad
two chicks with 15
no sweat get owned peacock
double hit on the same enemy is okay by
me
peacock
you peace
wow we lose this one well well well
that's a scary comp man
so we have one win left to play with
i mean i i'm a simple man i
i think you'd absolutely have to do this
i don't think you'd change much
[Laughter]
just to be honest
um
i'm just wondering if like a one-up
doesn't really work too well on on
anything
i think you just buy sushi
one up snake
in case it gets sniped
it is 18 hp like
one up tiger would have made sense for
sure that that makes sense to me we
lived through our first attack here
which is stunning to me please heal oh
you killed the deer you genius
oh it's healing it's just it's not
healing for as much i think holy crap
this turkey's so strong dude
uh never mind
um i'm still scared
this looks like a loss to me
every time
yeah
well honestly well played i can't be too
upset about this one
is it an eight win game our hippo just
kind of it ran out i think
it's not bad though i mean eight wins is
still pretty sick
okay sorry i forgot to run oh we're
still on free to play builds by the way
which is fine but um let me let me start
a casino up here start prediction
look i'm feeling pretty good today let's
up it to six wins or more and we'll run
a two minute prediction there
i want my points back from yesterday
the casino apologizes for your
for the mistake they made yesterday
ant is great
beaver is great
mosquito tutu with some with some spice
attached to it is not bad early let's
just see if we can't do a little bit
better
i think you could buy a beaver
knowing you're gonna get a sweet sale
out of it next time i do think you
freeze a horse
be the talkative rangers how about that
save a horse ride a cowboy yeah
so i saddled up my oh god
horse and i drive into the city
i make a lot of noise
you know why cause the girls they are so
pretty i believe who's big and rich
saying that man
two two aspirational qualities
if you're a professional bodybuilder
now let me think about this is a draw
early
no
shot
i like fish stats early that doesn't
bother me okay
so i think you buy a fish
i actually think you unfreeze a horse
you could buy a pig for econ or you
could say
econ this
this is for sales to make something
better in the future
i want to get some wins this is going to
spice you up you're going to be a little
spiced up by this i'm just going to let
you know
we're going to make a five five
fish and we're gonna buy a pig that
exclusively exists as a meat shield and
then to only cost us one next turn
these are econ plays these are future
plays do not shoot my aunt you piece of
garbage you piece you piece of holy
crap okay never mind
i still think we probably lose this one
oh we definitely lose this one but i
knew it was gonna happen
in all likelihood these are econ plays
to springboard us in the future
it's like magic the gathering you can
play with a little loss from time to
time
um
you sell the pig
you buy a flamingo
you freeze a pill for now
you roll to look for a beaver
without getting one check this out okay
you s you sell a beaver
buy a peacock okay i know you're like
what the hell are you doing here just
just freaking work with me okay
pill
the flamingo
by
a flamingo
roll me
i think you freeze a dog just in case
and roll me again
okay this is okay
either i don't think you need elephant
peacock i don't like maybe if you had
garlic armor on the peacock then we're
talking and you could make that happen
but for now
honestly this this is the way i pray
yeah let's roll it like that maybe
so our peacock is our win condition but
not forever just for now
it's only a level one horse
no sweat man
oh you peace that's a good smack though
we're getting a nice trade here i'm i
like my odds honestly i like my odds
although you are gonna get buffed but
then i was just gonna say
you're gonna buff me him me him him me
thanks for the free win
horse strats are no longer meta okay
we're trying to get our units to level
up a little bit
so dodo was a lot of fun last time i got
nothing against the dodo
realistically we don't care for the
beaver
don't mind it
i think you can roll a dodo
that attaches here we're looking for
a pill for you
peace
roll me
pill me
pill me
you you peace
that's fine we'll roll like this instead
this is weird man this is like not a
traditional build
but in the mid game i think stats beat
synergies
it's a scary looking team i hate i hate
a sideways hat dude
you're so freaking lucky no shot no shot
buff the flamingo please thank you that
means we get a sick trade right here
which means we own you
there's a level two ants which means we
win
let's go man okay
now we're we're in a very s like strange
and unusual situation but that doesn't
mean it's bad
we freeze you for a pill chance we i
mean we actually don't mind
swallowing the ant here you'll get two
buffs out of it
so you could sell fish even though the
stats are good
you're basically replacing a 4-6 with a
2-6
so i think do this
or on the flamingo that's true
okay
sure
but please keep in mind we're also
looking for pills please
you peace pill me okay now
hold hold the front freaking door okay
you get pilled
yummy yummy
you get bought
you get frozen
you get rolled
we freeze a pill we roll again
we freeze you
we freeze you
get ready
kill the ants
what he's pogging though
i don't know what i'm saying
this squad has nasty stats man
this is a little spooky
ah that's not that spooky though thanks
for the free wins
um
i think this is a draw i don't see how
it couldn't be a draw
not that bad considering they outstatted
us i'm not feeling too bad about that
one at all
unfreeze that
kill you
bring your back
roll me
you know okay
pill me get out of it we need something
stronger than that
i don't
disagree
now you can roll a duck as just fodder
i think i'll freeze once and roll just
to see what we get
there's so i think garlic peacock is
also important so i think you buy a duck
knowing we're gonna sell it next time
to get garlic peacock going
the duck should not be there though
because it's gonna suck up the flamingo
buff
a level one deer already what the heck
hedgehog level two hedgehog at the back
is some nasty stuff man
it's not great
this this is a loss
uh such an early deer is very spicy man
what do we have we have two wins left
two two losses left to play with
look i can understand you being like my
points my points
i'm telling you this is
we're still searching for you know
what we're looking for the most here
so
i i've got hope though i got hope we
have a problem the monkey is great
scaling but nothing works well with it
unless we want to put a dodo at the
front or something
a giraffe has okay scaling
a worm is too late
i think i think this is a re-roll i
don't believe that many people watching
are gonna be like great job
okay now
you sell turtle
you know you're gonna want a peacock out
here or sorry sell sell duck
now turtle interests me
because we're gonna have
the turtle gets swallowed
whale becomes a 47 with melon armor
then when it spits it out again
it spits out
a turtle that will give melon armor to
the flamingo because we would set it up
like this
and then the flamingo and the dodo would
get buffed
yeah i would be okay with this
and we would probably be looking to pill
you and replace you with something
better
this is okay
don't don't read chat and look at the
question mark question mark question
mark they like honestly i'm just being
real with you they don't know what
they're talking about there's like two
people in there that know what they're
talking about but they're smart enough
to have the self-awareness to not type
it because they're like typing out my
imaginations is gonna take too long
let's just have fun with it the people
who don't know what they're talking
about are like i'm just gonna hit him
with the question marks because i think
he should buy the monkey and use it to
buff the flamingo for no reason
now we'll roll once
rooster dodo is like a must try
so we're looking here's the here's the
flow chart okay
you
add the peacock to the peacock on this
turn next turn we look to peel the
flamingo to put a rooster out here
behind the dodo and it's gonna freaking
crush it's gonna freaking crush okay
i'm just here for the juice
okay
try it
penguin at the front this is a horrible
squad this is really bad like for us
two level two horses
and a kangaroo is is mighty nasty we
don't even get the kill on this one we
get the kill on the
no the the turtle should get the kill no
because it's it's oh frick man
at least we get the kill here
then we
but oh my god dude this is this is
filthy
all right so we got one win to play with
here this is where we gotta
you know when you're riding your bike
and your pedals are spinning this is
where you shift up
this is an important moment okay the
flamingo is either going to be
sold or pills i'm willing to spend once
to see if we get a pill
we're gonna peel the dodo
we're gonna peel the roost we can't peel
the rooster we're gonna peel the dodo
and we're gonna peel the
peacock that's fine
nice now
we're gonna buy a rooster
the rooster is gonna get the benefit
of the dodo for now
we're gonna buy another dodo
although
now i'm like what if you sold this
freaking turtle
but if you sold this freaking turtle
ran a hippo dodo
whale sucks up the rooster
and then spits out a rooster that then
spits out another rooster don't don't
talk to me okay don't don't freaking
talk to me
i'm doing it i'm doing it okay i'm cause
i'm because i'm nuts
cause i'm insane there i don't believe
that this is likely to work just for the
record
but i believe that this gives us the
twin it's the matrix intersection
ah you peace
it's the matrix intersection
of
most likely to win here and most likely
to win next time that's fine we knew
that was plausible if not even likely
crazy frog just a frog for me man
that's definitely true
okay we still win
this we got a lot of work to be done
okay
we're trying to get to six wins
of course now we get several turtles
i'm just gonna level with you
you need some hp and you need some
garlic
roll me one save a deer no roll me once
we're gonna freeze you to try to move up
a tier next time
which again i understand the risk
the hippo does benefit nicely from stats
regardless we're gonna have a 14-10
hippo with garlic armor we want to see
white weenie horse dog horster you
this is the danger
when you control the meta
you end up creating your own worst
nightmare man
it's all right we live through this
i i think we win this one easily again
i i have an honest opinion by the way
which is that
free to play players in games tend to be
substantially better than
non-free-to-play players
when i go to the pay to win side i'm
like i'm going up against people like
myself that were like five dollars
um
is a small price to pay for some free
wins
free to play people are used to grinding
man they're used to spending hours and
hours
you know in the mines just to get a
small advantage
this these are big plays like i'm
i'm very happy with this although we do
need to rework the structure um
i have to think i don't i don't really
think i want a leopard yet but
i mean okay
um
there's a way to get start of battle to
work two times right
like or to control the order
like does it go left to right
because like what i'm thinking is like
we want the dodo to do its ability
before
the leopard does its ability so i think
you could sell dota sell whale
let me just think sell
whale dodo hits
either rooster or leopard
rooster
but i still think you can roll a leopard
on the squad
our whale yeah our whales not doing much
that's the problem so i think you sell
buy
freeze
we know we need the hippo to get the
buff so you'd set it up probably like
this
maybe you'd put the peacock at the back
in the hopes you run into the weakest
units of poss that you could possibly
ever find
um and then roll me
garlic is always like early on it's a
pretty nice hold just in general this is
the least confident i have been by the
way
this this is the scary round for me
12 12 buffalo at the front with splash
damage
sub-optimal
it's in god's hands now
garlic armor does not impact me
hmm that's nasty
yeah this is a loss
hey black truffler thanks for the gift
of
hopefully some of those went to the
believers
as they are not getting paid out for
this one
still i can't be too upset we went four
and four
we're also going to slash marker sap one
pay them out anyway no no no we'll run
it back here six wins or more and let's
uh



oh i meant i meant to go on pay to win
that's fine dude this is a great start
okay
so you buy fish
you buy otter which then buffs the fish
and then you buy ant which buffs the
fish then you roll me
freeze me
a duck is a nice thing to hold but i
think you just freeze one fish for now
i don't like my squad man
i don't like my squad
this would be the edible chunks but
what's the best i can do
one two versus one two
don't shoot my aunt you peace
okay i can live with that
we trade
we trade
you peace
[Laughter]
we should have had that one but what can
you do right um
so i think you buy an ants
we could actually our squad could
freaking ball out next time okay
freeze me a pig just in case
i mean in my world that's a sell buy
i don't i don't i don't bother myself
with this
freeze me unfreeze me freeze me
you didn't have to sell that time that's
true
i forgot the the beaver sorry the otter
is on purchase three mosquitoes i see we
got a very similar squad rolling here
this is a very nice buff from that ant
though oh never mind i forgot you had a
horse that makes a lot of sense
we draw
by the grace of god
okay tier two animals
i sleep
tier three animals
i pop
no
[Laughter]
you're gonna okay okay a two-four is
really good we shouldn't just give up
free winds okay so the dog is
best served protecting right now
honestly the ant believe it or not we
freeze this sand we freeze this pill
we'll get we'll sell you next turn
in order to buy this ant in order to
pill it
might even freeze too
that's a weird dog look i don't know
animals okay
you have you have a whale already i
guess i can't be mad
what the
it seems weird to not have the whale eat
something
we do lose this one though
so what do i know
buying an ant just to pill it is way
worse than just getting the stats yeah
but have you considered it also gives us
the dog trigger
sell me because you do we have to get
rid of it
buy me
interesting
buy me
kill me
camel me
camel me
camel me
and for now
we can roll
i'm just
we can roll like this
and
roll me
spider me spider freeze me
okay early swan hedgehog at the back is
cheeky i respect it
i like our odds i i like where we stand
i don't see how we lose this one
big whoop
come on b at the back is actually like
that's like day one meta i'm not trying
to make you feel bad or whatever but
that's day one meta
okay so check this out
this is weird i want all the dog
triggers but i don't really want to dump
this fish but let's see you go like this
i can't dump i can't dump a 98 fish man
i can't do it
it's too good right now
we do want a double
trigger on the dog
and yet
i'm not i'm not selling the fish man i'm
not selling a fish i'd rather sell a
camel
summon a spider
combine the spider
i don't know why she swallowed the damn
fly
now
now
ox temporarily does really well with a
spider in front of it freeze me some
garlic past my turn
this turn was such a throw ler insanity
24-hour trunk on the line
you're lucky we're going up against taco
butt who has like the squad of the
century here
big buffs please i mean this person they
got a great team but please keep in mind
they did also end up rolling a snail
we do lose though all right well you're
not trunked
[Laughter]
fair enough
two snails
saved consider yourself saved
ox goes you're just a temporary
you're just a cog in the machine spider
for dog combination level four
i don't see how we can't roll a penguin
right now
dude what's wrong with this freaking dog
like why don't you do something
okay
pill the turtle
this is this dog being a 312
honestly is just he's honestly pissing
me off i'm just gonna say it it's
pissing me off
this is a nice little buff here though
we do 313 like are you stupid
get some offense man
dodo at the front
have have we fallen so far that we're
going up against dodo at the front
all right that's a good melon armor
i guess they're doing it to get the
monkey bonus but still
please just get some attack
would it would it hurt you so much to
get some attack
315 are you are you i was gonna say
snoop dogg what i meant to say is stone
cold steve austin
whatever we give him we give him a steak
or something
he's he's chunking
well
i think you sell a penguin
for now
by a spider
314 combine your spiders i know it's why
wouldn't you put it in the front it's
okay don't worry about it we'll buy a
deer run the deer at the front
roll me once shame on me
roll me twice shame on we won't get
shamed again
buy some i was going to say some garlic
armor we don't really need any dang
garlic armor on anybody
cupcake i get you i i don't wanna just
overspend on re-rolls
i guess i'm gonna i'm gonna put some
garlic armor on the dog
in the hopes that he picks up
some attack over the course of this
fight
i don't love splash damage in this in
this situation
but it's only making a dodo so big whoop
man
big whoop
i don't dude that dog at the back is
kind of
is kind of doing some stuff
the garlic armor is going to help look
at how tanky this guy is man he can't be
stopped
now we just need a crab
okay okay every everybody relax
can me
i would be inclined to say
that a sheep
in place of
i mean i hate to say it man a sheep in
place of the deer is kind of the play
right now
you could merge the spiders i guess you
know what
that's probably smarter but we we get
one less
we get we have one less capacity for
triggers in the future but that's okay
that's i think you're right
i don't want the sheep to die to splash
damage
i guess either the sheep or the spider
is dying to splash damage so i you know
let's let's keep that sheep back there
roll me
i'm just gonna level with you man can me
we're gonna invest in some scaling here
316 stone cold steve austin dog
this is actually
except for the turkey existing this is
semi good luck for us never mind because
it also gives oh yeah rip
this is not a great team for us
however this fish
everybody laughed at this fish man
and there they go this is not great
level two cricket and then spiders as
well
oh no
we're asking a lot from our dog let's
just put it that way um and it's not
gonna it's not up to the task
that's a nasty team like
that's just
you gotta respect it this isn't
it's looking good for the doubters right
now there's no denying it
no use hiding it you might as well
embrace it
a little late for the giraffe
congratulations dan opened your pack on
stream and
he you got a red dang demon card yeah i
got a pack somehow i don't know what it
does um i don't know where to collect it
nobody has described it to me
um
but i'm happy to have it we'll start the
bidding at
eight ethereum
eight ethereum
nine
this is legally binding by the way
roll me
it's not legally binding what do i know
a dog huh
well
okay so there is a part of me now that
is like you sell the fish
you go to 11.
you get
a dodo which then creates
an 816 dog with the armor
which at least
gives us a chance to survive
now i'm just thinking i'm just thinking
this basically buffs the attack of both
you freeze the spider
you crank on this dodo already
you sell a deer
no
freeze me oh please just let me live man
if we could get this fly out here
if we could get this fly out here
we could sell the spider to create a fly
but um
sell the deer it only gives us one gold
because it's a level one
but the spider is literally one away
from being a level three
you could sell a sheep
knowing you're likely to get one back in
the future i'm not selling the dodo you
lost your damn mind i think you sell the
sheep
it's only a 4-4 this is gonna be an
amazing unit for us
the sheep doesn't get us there
well at this point
we might as well sell the deer
to create a fly
and then this is basically
insanity i would not recommend this
it's in god's hands now
they also have a fly huh
i see i see i see
i see
this this kangaroo is scaring me okay
i'm not denying the kangaroo
but we
oh you peace
we live through this
which means we get to hit you one time
oh you peace
yeah this is uh the end
was all thrown from that one turn well
no we did have three losses before we
led to it
we'll pay out the doubters on that we we
honestly ran into like a pretty nasty
squad there
run the prediction back
six or more wins
that's the beauty of your um
your strategy not having been displayed
is that in your head you can just be
like i won
if he i know that he loses
when he uses his own strategy
if he had just used my strategy
the hooting housewives
it's strictly better
we'll go just remind me for pay to win
next time okay
this looks like uh this looks like a
loss for me early i think
well
yes
no actually it's a win holy crap
we haven't won the first round in a
while
now
i think we actually want to wait
on getting our next level cricket
because
we want to get a tier three not a tier
two so i don't mind running like a full
freaking squad out here
oh baby
then
something like that
question mark question mark question
mark
[Laughter]
put your question marks in a freaking
sack and stuff them
sorry jay i didn't see your message
we may still lose this round like this
is a it's a spicy squad we're going up
against here five five fish is pretty
tough to deal with
he said he's been eaten
i was just talking about oh eating
crickets with your vacuum i see
now we got tier twos guess what
now we got a tier three dude tier three
sheep is kind of pog
i'm probably gonna go dodo too just to
be honest
i'm gonna sell a duck
which buffs everything
i don't see why i wouldn't roll like a
dodo
and the sheep
i'm honestly probably going to combine
crickets again just
like this quick is going to be freaking
nasty
you're 2-4
i mean would you rather have a 3-5
sorry a 5-3 or a 6-5 i'd rather have a
6'5 so let's put you here for now
we know we want some some dodge rams up
there because they're built ford tough
4-4 crab
doesn't benefit from stats air go i
re-roll you
i break the wrist i walk away
spiders kind of interesting i'm going to
be honest though man we're going to try
to get to
a level oh you peace
we should have put it on the side it's
not a it's not a huge problem just make
sure you don't have empty space in front
of the dodo then i would cry for sure uh
we'll keep that swan frozen you know
what
unfreeze the swan roll me two spiders
instead okay
level three cricket will give us
possibly tier
five units early
horse is very scary here at least it's
only level one
and they only have a cricket that
capitalizes on it our cricket's doing
some work it's doing some work
it's still doing some work
it's
still doing so this is a
win hooting housewives beat pouting
housewives nacho taco hey thanks for the
five gifted subscriptions one for each
cricket we've created
we know we want a spider
i think we want another spider
i think we sell fish believe it or not
then we can roll two spiders instead for
the time being
i know we could kill one but i don't
wanna random tier three i snooze on that
and then we do want a horse
so i think now even though it's only
level one
we do enjoy this for the time being
and then this will give us a tier
upgrade in the future
this is still it's early okay
you don't have to you don't have to bet
on your winning strategy quite yet
you just need to win rounds
this kangaroo is gonna piss me off man i
can already tell
level two horse your horse beats my
horse congrats
what's horse is mine this kangaroo is
going to be a damn disaster
i mean you're already
hitting harder than
anything else on my team so
yeah it's a loss this one's a loss like
you know what we just need to copy this
how about you give me a kangaroo you
piece of crap
the vivid streamers
it's a little late for a dog i'm
investing
dolphins snipe on a horse
is acceptable
i think we're selling our horse
running a dolphin
rolling
in which case there's no reason we can't
sell a sheep
freeze me
because we don't want to move up a tier
yet we'll wait for our next one because
we won't be able to buy the unit it
creates
sell sheep
buy snail
i don't know where you put this guy
let's just be real
sell dodo why do people disrespect the
dodo so much man the dodo is like
he's topped here
we could sell a snail
and buy a cricket
what we're doing in that is saving
ourselves three gold next turn
at the cost of one
attack this turn
that's probably okay now in fact a 2-2
because this is actually more like a 2-3
now that i think about yeah it makes a
lot of sense actually
it's not a free tier 3.
i'm
first off i think it's gonna be a tier
five
but that like also it's not free i
literally just bought it
okay so we kill an ant for free not
great
doesn't really matter who you buff
that's fine
it mattered a little
you badger piece of holy crap you
jerk
[Laughter]
1-1 cricket i think we come out of this
one though
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah we come out of this one
easily
wasn't even close
donkey donkey don't get dunk this is big
well i think we must
buy it
some scaling is nice
it's going to scale it's going to scale
i would go a step further it's not that
some scaling is nice some scaling is
essential
i'll be straight up with you i think we
are in like a heavy
roll territory
so that you get what you want we don't
need to roll a spider long term
i don't really like what the whale sucks
up here
an ox does pretty well with like a
spider in front of it but at the cost of
losing our dolphin i don't respect it
you peace man you
peace please i need to i need to recover
some honor
i see we have a very similar build here
except you have a level two horse your
sheeps are getting all fricked up man
your sheeps are getting all freaked up
what's happening
oh okay
whatever
that's fine it's not great but it's fine
that's very it's totally fine
we draw
yeah
we draw
kangaroo is potentially kind of
important
freeze me for a second
so a kangaroo you sell oh man lose sell
the dodo shut
shut it okay
you just shut it
this dodo has done nothing wrong for the
whole game and people are just insulting
him over and over you sell the dolphin
to buy the kangaroo
and then you put the kangaroo
behind
your tank lord like like so okay
i gotta i gotta think about this a
little bit more before i fully commit
but everyone just
slow your damn roll for a second
you having garlic is a huge help for me
now roll me once more anyway
okay now
who gets the attack
freeze me
who gets the attack
why wouldn't you give it to the cricket
because nine's already enough to mostly
kill
that's true but i can't i got well we
gotta get we're giving it a spider or
kangaroo
you should give it to kangaroos spiders
get in the buff every turn
but kangaroo scales itself
okay
okay
okay
okay freeze me
seven eight up at the front
level one dodo making roosters stronger
heck of a kangaroo back here
no doubt about okay i i see your synergy
we just got to be fast
i think we're fast dude this cricket is
actually popping
not as much as i needed it to but oh
never mind hold on
you create a level one chick that
doesn't kill me we win the round against
the fussy botox okay
okay four wins
now rooster works very nicely with a
dodo
there's no denying that
we got too many synergies rolling here
man like i'm not sold on the idea
that a um
that a monkey works here
penguin only buffs two units yeah monkey
only buffs one unit
and it has to be in the right most
position
rooster monkey has some ramp potential
there's a problem though
if the rooster
gets to level two we don't want them to
be at the front anymore because they
summon more than one chick now it's a
problem for the future
cricket's gotta go soon you're insane
man you're insane
i don't think we pivot
i'm gonna freeze you for a moment
and i'm gonna
i'm thinking this is this is a thinker
sell the cricket tell me you're a
doubter tell me you're a two-win
pay-to-win marty without telling me
you're a two-win pay to win marty okay
eight
win eight eight turn pill the spider
is at eight seven we would create a tier
three unit as a four four
for one gold that's it okay look
you're on trunk watch that's all i'm
saying
we could at least sell it for two if we
had to get rid of it
i with only two lives to play with
i invest in winning now
which for me
means rolling
into a dodo
i see the pair don't don't worry about
the pair
not investing in a spider
one more
okay
freeze
freeze me
hello
dad
can me
bison me
bison me
penguin penguin
hello
selmy
bison me
roll
me
freeze me
roll me
hello
hey
did you show chet what happened to the
crash bandicoot i did i showed him
yesterday
honey where's your nose
that was instant where's your head
good girl
where's your
oh peek-a-boo
oh
she's working on it peek-a-boo
peek-a-boo
yeah
peek-a-boo
okay she's working on it
what sound does a cow make
[Laughter]
now we can no longer sell our cricket
but that's okay man
want to dump that penguin now
but still
i'm not
i'm very scared
that's what what is this
gig
what is this gigabrain team that we're
running up against here
all right congratulations um
we drew
and yet
i also watched two episodes of uh
too hot to handle last night whereas it
seems like you invested your whole life
just trying to data mine the source code
so who really won that one when you
think about it
now
that's big
sell
sell penguin
to get monkey although you're getting a
nice buff here
penguin does buff dodo now you're not
wrong
but the penguin itself doesn't do
anything it's only a two three
sell the kangaroo i bet you'd like that
wouldn't you doubter excuse me sell ca
who said sell kangaroo
predicted yes
nooblit121
you have the floor explain yourself
now here's something i'm entertaining
the thought of
selling a kangaroo
to buy a monkey
to super buff our cricket
he doesn't die instantaneously okay we
just need this son of a gun to be able
to attack more often
and then this but he is only a level one
this is the thinking man's environment
the dog you know what you're right the
dodo does buff too now but we could just
roll
this as our double buff
garlic on you as well
and then put two scaling units at the
back and pray
we're not going to get to a 50 50
cricket that's a long way to go
that's a long way to go
i think i think we sell
i think we buy
i think we freeze i don't know i guess
we would sell a penguin to get a stat
boost
we're gonna invest in you just because
you have you know we're gonna roll once
to see if we get garlic we did not get
that's a huge freeze potentially right
here roll me one more time
rooster is also kind of insane
now the way that the rooster would work
is
you move the bison back one
rooster comes up
rooster then becomes a 12-5 that summons
a 12-1 when it dies
uh and it needs to get buffed by the
monkey
you're gonna laugh
i think we sell
monkey
hello daniel thank you for the raid
i know we should thank you and i'm not
trying to be in insincere it's just a
very tight one let me explain my
reasoning
penguin buffs dodo and cricket let's
ignore that for now though
penguin buffs dodo
which then can be used to buff rooster
rooster doesn't need permanent hp if it
or permanent damage if it just gets the
damage
temporarily from a dodo that we're never
going to sell that's fine
so
you sell
monkey
you buy rooster rooster goes to the
front
the cricket still gets the buff
for now
just for now the cricket gets the buff
because it has garlic armor so i would
rather have
an 1811 with garlic armor
then have a
12 12 which would actually be a 1912 yes
okay but
once we
i mean people are like sell the cricket
yeah good idea sell the cricket so that
our bison doesn't scale at all
good one
freeze the penguin for the next turn
roll me
we're never gonna make use of this cow
okay
this is where we this is where we hold
we're not gonna use the count what are
we gonna use the cow for
what are we gonna sell to get a cow
well actually it's not that bad because
you can sell if we don't get another
penguin we could sell a level one
penguin buy the cow
juice them up put the level one penguin
back out but if we do get another pay
we're gonna go for a level two penguin
which i actually think is important
it's a good point what would we do with
the snail fair enough
sell the cricket buy the cow if we sell
the cricket we have to sell the bison
because the bison is the only reason the
the cricket is the only reason that the
bison has any scaling
this is not unexpected
so much for our garlic armor
that kangaroo's gonna screw us man
um yes okay so we're gonna go down to
one here that was a lot of talking just
to get like your ass beat
the dodo's level two gain plus two plus
two
if there is at least one level three
friend
the dodo is indeed level two how is this
relevant to the conversation surrounding
the bison scale
you gotta know what you're talking about
to talk about it
okay
this is this is how we win you sell the
penguin
you purchase a snail
you sell the snail
you purchase a cow
and a moo to you as well
you
something's gotta hit man
i guess you're gonna i guess you're
gonna hit the dodo here
you're gonna milk the dodo you're gonna
sell the cow
you're gonna purchase a penguin you're
gonna roll once
you're gonna freeze one of these
in fact i'm gonna be honest i think you
freeze two
and we're gonna buff the dodo
with the pear
please god just let me live i've seen
what you've done for others and i want
it for myself
one one deer with a whale
you know how you know how it goes
we're gonna be it's a turkey build with
a little badger at the back which is
quite spooky
this is not so bad though you get killed
in one shot the kangaroo gets stronger
you get killed in one shot the kangaroo
gets stronger
you get killed in one shot
the kangaroo gets stronger
we kill you easily
we win this round we win this round
no sweat
i mean you're running a late game badger
that's like that's a shot in the dark
i don't blame you don't get me wrong i'm
just saying now this son of a gun right
here summons two
chicks which means we gotta bring you
back
so that we have the space to create two
food with health and attack effects are
doubled you could buy
a
cat instead of a penguin
and then start investing in foods
i don't buy it
roll me once
no point in freezing a snail i'll just
level with you on that one
i don't i don't see the mammoth being
the play although with the pill it is
nice
i'd rather keep the plus one plus one
scaling going i think we just buy some
some pizza time man this is the deciding
round for believers
nifty little buffett buffed the rooster
too okay
1817 up at the front
level threes are scary i know you're
looking at it and you're like i'm not
impressed with what you're seeing here
level threes are very spooky though
that's all i'm going to say about that
our rooster is not going to die
thankfully
oh my god we're pogging
this is anti-pog we're going to lose our
rooster but then we're gonna create oh
no we're gonna lose two roosters
we should still be good
you're still dying here let's go
believers
six wins
i wanted that one i'm just gonna level
with you i wanted that one
freeze me
roll me
i'm just gonna be honest with you juice
me
squeeze me
roll me
freeze me i would love to get one more
penguin if we're ever gonna get
to the next level oh yeah you're right
we missed the bison in there if we're
ever gonna get to
ten wind territory and it's not looking
good we're gonna need the penguin to
scale and we're gonna need the bison to
scale
this is one of those squads that doesn't
frighten me
um
and yet i find myself frightened because
it doesn't frighten me you know what i
mean
lose your melon armor for no good reason
easiest win in my life
okay
i think to me it's more important
actually you know what we can do both no
we won't have time uh we won't have
money i should say
we'll get the penguin first
because it hits three units
and then we'll get the bison next turn
if we live
sounds good to me that was an easy turn
we're scaling a little
21 20. you got a level two rooster up
there you got a turkey with a tiger
tiger turkey with a fly i think means uh
give up you lose
i'm i'm stunned we lived through that
uh we don't really though because the
flag gets created
every time the chicken gets like one
extra
kill than it's supposed to i'm a very
happy man
god i hate you
you're such a piece of
i hate you so much
yes okay and then at least i'm gonna
have two two flying then make it a
freaking eight eight okay eat my butt
eat my butt
two oh well one one turkey that's in
there yeah yeah then you're gonna eat my
butt
it's it's barely a loss but it is a loss
fair enough
we we actually punched through
hippo would have slapped there but i'm
happy in my belief nonetheless that was
a seven win
and we were a little bit funky there a
couple times
double turkey tiger on turkey flies geez
louise man okay we're gonna we're gonna
go to six wins or more again we're gonna
play on the
pay to win build here
it's not really pay to win because you
play against other pay to wins but
oh baby
i don't care for a mosquito too much but
we'll freeze it just think i i mosquito
is probably my my sweetest friend
honestly like i don't see how you don't
roll this build now
i don't want to freeze two mosquitoes i
have faith will get an ant in the future
be the bumbling bushes alliteration is
the ultimate strategy
these are high stat marty's
but all they have is stats you peace
you peace
we win that if the first ant
hits the other 50 50 and gets our bird a
big whoop
was that a hurt reference no it was a
reference to johnny cash
i don't know who
hurt
like william hurt
okay like
look all right don't be a piece
don't hit both ants
you peace
[Laughter]
we got to keep one space open for level
twos and then that'll give us some space
for some level threes too
[Laughter]
all right
don't shoot my bird man
okay we we lived
for now
even if it's a draw i'm not scared i'm
not i'm not messing
look at that good win good win 6-2 bird
just chilling at the back
beaver paid some dividends
to the doubters to the doubters maybe
thanks for my level 2 unit i really
appreciate it
now we're fricking talking man
let's give him something to talk about
i think um
you definitely are gonna
combine well i don't know the pigs they
sell for a lot maybe this is a better
let's take us to six eight yeah i think
it's a double sell situation
then you you know you're taking a fish
okay a beetle we don't care for because
it's a tier one we're gonna roll a
little roll a little deeper
it rolls just a little too long
don't care for our flamingo to get
stronger
so i think you maybe roll it like that
as weird as it is
and roll once
i snooze
that's a snooze in my world
dude this bird is going to be a piece
2 hp at the 8 hp at the front
don't shoot my flamingo
saved
how do you have a dromedary that's this
strong already
could it be resin
10-4 good buddy we do lose
but
sorry a loss is a win because we're
scaling anyway uh it's a cupcake for
sure i don't respect that using a
cupcake to get a a win
uh just so you can beat the streamer
it's pretty messed up man
i don't mind a dromedary but i think we
can do a little better
it's literally like the same team
i would like to kill i mean pill two
ants the birds are getting out of
control but i'm also like maybe i i
think you roll one
freeze a swan in place of an ant could
have done something but i'm i saw i saw
her face and now i'm a believer man we
got a 12-7 bird that's getting pretty
close to level three
dog build
i feel like our bird matches up okay
against dog that doesn't scare me too
much
that's beautiful luck
i think this is uh uh
actually i think this is a loss man i
think we lose to the b at the back
actually we lose before the b at the
back
geez louise okay hold on
one win
two losses
three losses
that's not ideal
my points
freeze me roll me
early deer is like devastating
what the hell
you beast
whatever we still we crushed you there
crush you there
crush your hair
plug it in plug it in that's a win
yeah i don't know why he had garlic deer
but you know whatever
um
i'm not fully sold on a bat yet
i'm looking for a pill which we are
lucky enough to get okay if we're gonna
get a pill
then i think we buy a bat for now for
sure for now
then you're gonna roll me we're fishing
for a bird man
garlic on bird is gonna that's gonna win
us a lot of rounds
i'm not even entertaining the thought
i don't want it i'm not even
entertaining the thought that we're
gonna lose this round we have an 1811
bird at the back
level two bat
oh it hit my good unit
that's a surprise
said no one ever
i think we draw though
in spite of we win
i i did not see that coming
this is
non-negotiable
you can always just dump an ant or or
honestly a bat for that two one three
one
poodle scaling's kind of sick man
we could sell the bat we could get a bat
later
him me him
him me
give the poodle some scaling the ant is
probably the ant and the deer are the
next thing to go
get rid of the tropical fish how about
you you shut your tropical fish
you can
now sell
ants
by
rooster
rooster at the back
pill ants hey you gotta you got a pill
you're gonna give me you gotta you got a
pill you're gonna give me
you put a rooster at the back
we're taking our life into our own hands
okay
i hate to say it the people who said
tropical fish
get sold
you're wrong you keep the fish for one
more turn
simply one more turn
you sell the deer
you buy a and place the chick back there
then you roll me once
and then you pray to god
the scaling has begun
there's not going to be a next turn
everyone chill okay
level one bat don't hit my bird
whatever nobody cares about that guy
anyway
little bus with a splash attack whatever
nobody
cares nobody cares i kind of care about
this one but that's fine get cramped on
nobody cares get cramped on
we win the round
dirty rat
why are you scaling that chick though
it's a good point we'd love to scale the
rooster instead
it worked but you're right you're right
that was not the right way to play it
although it did nicely for us there
get sold you you're there him me him him
me
peacock's not the plays i think it's a
little late turtle turtle's got
something man like i think turtle is a
is if we get down to three gold
it counters a bat
there's some there's some stuff to like
about it
it's a tier three
it won't get buffed by the poodle but
that's okay
i'm like
turtle me
turtle pill for melon armor okay
and then a deer in front again
why would pill the rooster are you
why did how to turn your four or five
into a four one
for the low low price of one gold
then another turtle after that that's
paying four gold for melon yeah but
melon costs three but only in the late
game i think
i think pill turtle is okay we don't
need to roll it yet but we could just we
could freeze a pill
play a turtle and then look for
something else on a reroll quickly
it's not caterpillar's not to play we
might get you know what i bet i bet you
we do get to
a living bison i don't it's not gonna
happen yet
but
it's in god's hands now
[Laughter]
you got a full squad huh
don't hit don't hit my melon armor unit
are you crazy
i lived
oh my god we won
[Laughter]
baby i love your way
every day
wanna love your way every day
wait wait tier five that means we could
get chocolate
if we get chocolate we didn't
that's fine we're really like we want
this board
level three board is the next step
board not
bore bored
ah it's simple just a level three bat no
big deal uh good game everybody good
game
you peace
what the heck man rhino
rhinos pretty sick
let's freaking dude that's why i keep
forgetting
that's why i go back to uh free to play
is cause the damn bats showing up every
single game
kiss me every time give me a slash
marker sap two



i'm gonna start our prediction well and
i'll get to six wins or more we're still
gonna play on the pay to win
beavers kind of have diminishing returns
but
i mean
that's pretty sick on it i mean i think
you freeze two of those sons of guns
i'll be the
the slippery bamboos if you know what i
mean
two one two one four two
it's a draw
it's called math sweetie
we don't invest on this turn
although what we could do is freeze
roll
what's done is done
combine
we should have combined the fish instead
because we get a value although we're
not going to sell these
so fuse one
there you go
we accept this
trade trade win
i think i think we win this one
i'm i'm betting the farm we win this one
that that beaver's too strong man
all right we draw
it's all right we we got scaling
yes we do we got scaling how about you
might as well start right i'm like maybe
you freeze this son of a gun no i don't
think so an owl it's a great sellable
it's a potent potable man
and then like an owl just existing is
fine
that's exactly what we wanted to see
quite frankly
um
so i think we rolled two owls
and then starting on the next turn
we're going to sell a
beaver and both owls and our fish and
our bird are going to be like disgusting
we want the fish to get statted for now
because the beaver's not long for this
world
doesn't scale we're just going to sell
both of them
we're going to sell them both
that's probably the best possible
hit there that's amazing
nice bat
can't really blame me if you can't beat
him join him
so
gives two random friends
plus two health
give a random friend plus two plus two
we can't afford for this to hit the
beaver
i can live with this
i don't want the peacock i don't i don't
trust it the the peacock you peace okay
we're gonna freeze you we're gonna hold
you for a couple turns because you're an
eight eight we're gonna hold you for a
couple turns
eight eight is good enough to hold
in fact well no because you get it we
get a huge benefit out of selling you
i think a spider is fine
i think we can afford to invest in this
quite frankly
we can roll two times
and then
to be honest with you
maybe we freeze you okay
but we apple
something is going to be sticking around
for a bit
not long but a bit
then you roll me one more time you get
freaking pill you piece of garbage
eight eight up at the front on turn four
it's a nasty thing to run across
don't don't hit the owl anything but the
owl that's fine drama there's a piece of
garbage anyway you know it i know it
everybody knows it
i think we win
i think
we
i think we draw
okay
owl makes me scale dude it's a 8-8
what's your problem
get pilled
get scaled
i i i like some scaling
with some super scaling
with some selling
with some batting
with some
ratting
with some
this this is a risk maybe some
we got lives to play with just keep that
in mind okay
we can buy one thing and still scale
scale me
we we we invested a lot
to make our team worse so that it will
be better later
we're getting really lucky on those on
those bats man i'm just gonna be honest
you're a piece
i think we draw though which is good
because we're a scale build right now
one of the easiest roles of my life
i don't care what you hit okay
you peace
i'm not gonna
buy and sell you to give you a random to
give a random tutu we're gonna freeze
you
for now roll you once
freeze you see how the mood strikes you
we're gonna buy you we're gonna roll you
we're gonna let the rhythm take you over
by the mouse
i don't know i hope you keep it when we
combine you we stay at two
scale me scale me
juice me sna combine me snail me if we
lose me
good good combo at the start here
7-5 loses to 5-6
2-5 does not beat five six but it's okay
this is heavy draws
we a draw where we scale i'm a very very
happy camper
unfreeze me
that's a gimme
that's a gimme
you're gonna roll me
you're gonna freeze the crap out of me
you're gonna freeze the crap
you're gonna freeze the crap out of me
you're gonna roll me one time one time
and that's it and then you're gonna end
your turn
yummy yummy yummy
i've got 15 14 16 14 papi and i feel
like poning you
uh a deer
chungus is fishy muffins sounds
delicious
okay peacock getting hit by that
probably a dream come true
we get a nice trade on the bison here
this is a loss i think
it is a loss
i'm not sweating it though
oh yeah yeah our scaling is still good
buy me
come bind me
you know what i'm realizing though the
chick is not good
because it it it soaks up the
nah it's still pretty good
i'm stupid
roll me
roll me
this is this is still totally fine this
is there's nothing wrong with this
2x puppy no because we're going to
combine them
we'd rather you scale twice as fast for
sure
feeling pretty scared as a believer
honestly i wouldn't
we got a bat we got a puppy and one of
the most important things we've got is
like a roster that we can actually
afford to sell a lot of
in order to move better things in later
like we don't have an endowment effect
for anything right now
i do think we lose this one
i do know that we lose this one but the
scaling is gonna work
i'm telling you just believe
you definitely go up a level on the
puppy
now we're scaling like a son of a gun
you're gonna
we don't want to level up the bird yet
we'd rather do it next time so we get a
higher tier animal
i have a question about the mammoth
when the mammoth falls in battle
it makes everything
to two
plus two plus two but not forever
okay there's still i take it i take it
over fish
we still get the puppy
buff always put that son of a gun up at
the front
four six melon armor scares the crap out
of me at least we don't see a bat though
that's not a big deal
that's not a big deal
you don't die in one you do die in one
i'm bad at mathematics this is a win
this is a win even with melon armor this
is a win and a half
puppy
i don't mind a a
an eagle either but you definitely start
okay okay okay okay so here's what you
do piece of piece of crap you sell the
chick
we gotta think i'm like you sell the
chick you buy a dragon
then you
prioritize buying tier ones and you
scale out of your gourd there is a
problem
it requires us to sell either the bat
the bird or the mammoth
sell the mammoth it's kind of pog
it's kind of pog though
is the thing
dragon sucks somebody didn't see our 10
win marty
have you been watching kony's tier list
there's your first mistake
we don't really need the bird anymore
it's a seven eight that hits hard once
it's buffing the chick which we don't
care about we're gonna this is gonna be
out of here it is harder to make it work
with puppy econ scaling for sure
i would like to peel them in i would
like to keep this going so we could pill
the mammoth at some point
if you can kill the mammoth yes i know
that's it you know if if i did it o.j
simpson
the future is is cloudy you know we
don't with the chance of meatballs or
otherwise
either way we're holding this
if we sell
we go to nine
six
seven
plus one plus one on everybody
puffy
puffy hmm
there's a certain
spookiness here i think you sell the
bird i think the puppy's gonna scale
well enough on his own okay
you sell the bird
yes
i'm committing you sell the chick
you buy a dragon
you buy a fish
you sell the fish
takes you to five
you buy an eagle because it's half
decent
you have to be at the front
and then i'm like
puppy at the back i don't know
puppy puppy at the i don't know i don't
know
run me
we don't want it at the front front but
maybe just behind the mammoth it does
our positions don't really matter too
much right here and we could lose this
round but this is where the scaling is
going to begin hopefully in our dream
worlds two enemies are weak not our
uh puppy which means everything's okay
we have exactly the right math to make
this look uh never mind we we have
pretty close to exactly the right math
to make this look like it's better than
it is i think we draw
because you're gonna summon a chick
that's gonna 1-1 us
still though
good trade
why not roll the last two coins you need
two coins to scale the puppy
i don't think this is a can set up yet
i think this is a puppy
a freeze me a roll me
we don't see any ones
i have to think
of
a mammoth
a freeze me
a roll me
and take some time
a level three puppy would be well it'll
hit 50 50 at which point i don't know
what we're gonna do but
11 11 deer it's a scary squad
um we're gonna we're gonna kill it in
one which is nice obviously you're gonna
summon a bus
the bus is gonna die though okay
we're gonna kill the turtle
and we're gonna take off your armor
um
we're not gonna take off your armor
though this looks like a loss for sure
but a puppy if we can get you some
garlic armor or something
that might be a bigger priority than
leveling up here early
okay we're on two wins which is now it's
getting a little spooky
one up on eagle is pretty good
but please note i'm also trying to sell
this eagle
one up on mam it's kind of sick too
yeah okay i i believe
i roll
so we could
we could go all in on the puppy but i'm
a believer
in
sell me
seven
buy me
sell me
buy me
or chocolate bat is pretty good too man
or
get well you come back as a level one no
you come as a 1-1
what the hell i think i'm going to
ignore puppy scaling this turn that's
something i feel confident in saying
this does synergize
no questions there
but it's not going to work on this turn
this is a sell me
by me and don't worry about scaling on
this turn situation
freeze me
freeze me
i don't know what you're gonna do
honestly i guess you're gonna get super
buffed by a double mammoth
it's the same damn squad man
what a rip-off not today not today you
peace
not today
you peace
it was one off
i was one off from the draw
all right that was a two win marty we'll
pay out the doubters on that one
play me in the arena
and we'll run it back
deserve for skipping t-rex i mean i'm
pretty sure t-rex loses there too
it just loses with more people in the
audience with a smile on their face
t-rex is like it's a it's a great unit
don't get me wrong but it's a scaler man
and when you're on one win like
you got to be careful about how you uh
how you put your scalers out there
low key legs man
i'll be the low key legs
i don't think it matters what you hit
dude this is a win and this is a win
with some confidence
we freeze you we don't oh you know what
we could buy you
and then roll once
we're gonna buy you as a 2-2 so we can
sell you next turn
you might laugh on this one but i
honestly think you just put a b back
here so you win ties
hey
deglock thank you for the gifted
subscription thank you
i don't buy bees too much lately but
this is a rare situation where i'm a bee
leaver
this
could be a loss
that's lucky
it's a draw
not bad
we turned the b turned that loss into a
draw
tier two animals
now will become tier three animals
you you trader
now we must buy three units i think we
freeze you just in case
i can always get down with with this
right here
i'm not sold on the bird man just to be
honest with you
swan me
it's not even close man
it's the swan of the century
freeze me
that that swan was like an instant lock
that was
very lucky
it's a nasty team that you see here this
is a nasty team
now you will buff me
you're still dying that was good luck
for us
i'm still buffing
we're trading one for one
i think we win because of our
uh no we just win i was gonna say
because of the b but we just win
i still think we keep that snail out
there i'm just being straight up with
you man
so i think you can kill an ants
love to see it
and then we're gonna buy a
peacock i am going to murder you
roll me
swan me
roll me
roll me
freeze me freeze me
unfreeze me because we're not losing
this round
i see a four nine and a four nine scares
don't shoot my flamingo you
a four nine scares me but
i lived
i lived
i see what you're doing i still think we
win
not to mention we have a b at the back
that's three wins already
is it broken
my god
you peace
it's unlikely we're gonna get it to hit
but
there is something about it okay
it's turn five
i think you freeze and then you roll
just a little just just to see man
just to see what life has in store for
you
turtle peacock is is a bit of a classic
you know what
this is a bad setup for us here it's a
nasty squad
thanks for making my peacock even
stronger
your heart is true you're a friend and a
confidant
owns
owns
little ownage your owns
easy wins baby
one of you pieces just made me lose at
nine wins
[Laughter]
i like i like that one of you pieces
dude i gotta be honest with you i don't
want to dump a turtle
i i a turtle giving two melon armor and
then we just put our fish somewhere else
or more likely sell it at some point
i i do not mind it
i know we could get the easy melon armor
i'm happy leaving it out there for now
because it scales very nicely
garlic on peacock gets eaten so don't
get it confused at some point we're
going to want to hit these the turtle
also does hard count or bad you're not
joking
we got another one coming we'll freeze
you for now just in case i like an early
garlic
i'm going to be honest i'm i'm invested
i'm investing in your future
this is the easiest freeze of my life
um
give me a combine
and then i buy
and we just leave it we leave it sitting
there so we can get the next level
swan
level two peacock still doing some work
man
this squad with a with a caterpillar
doesn't scare me too much mosquitoes
effect did very little
we crush you
we crush you
you crush us
melon armor is not as good as i'd like
it to be i still feel like we win with
the b here
or even without the b
dude are you seeing this like
we're at 5-0 right now
unfreeze me
definitely combine me
friend bot gain gold
works three times per turn
i think we might as well try
might as well can
buy me
honestly
garlic meat
you're more likely to stick around than
the goat
and then we're going heavy on we might
as well freeze this man i mean at some
point we're gonna get
we're gonna get got okay
now there's a deer function here
not really it's probably better than a
fish but
and me
4-4
the 11-14 peacock is is freaking me out
a touch
[Laughter]
we lived through this hit though no you
peace
yeah yeah we lose this one
that was just honestly things just went
some of the rng went sideways for us
it was a 50 50 though you can't really
be too mad
the time has come for us to lose a fish
to get a snail
to sell the snail
to buy a peacock
to get the juice
now bad
i think
you freeze
this is like our
this is it's coming off the bench to be
in our squad
if we get nothing better
now a turtle
has created another goat
now i'm like hold on if you have two
goats
do you get two gold back for everything
that you buy
i don't know what the heck we would get
rid of to make the space but oh my god
look at this cute baby
the and the cute mommy the combo here
look at
this i love that hat
winter combo
does have tiny ears
kate i'm i'm pogging out of control
should i play this game you would i
think you would love it
i want to play it so i can't beat my
husband i'm i've been doing pretty bad
today but overall
i'm kind of
okay
in many ways
the the buy of the goat doesn't help us
here that's the only thing that's
getting me man because it only works
three x per turn we've already done it
three x so you basically buy it five
move it over you become a nine nine
i'm i'm not a believer in the goat man
what does the goat sound like
five seven bat huh
for now we roll in this squad right here
freeze me a pair just in case i don't
know what we're buffing but freeze me a
pair
sheesh
hmm
it's a nasty hit
i i don't that was probably like three
games ago at this point
i don't have an answer for you though i
wish
though i wish that i did
hey great great goats think alike look
at this this looks like a believer
payout
look at that
i think i did i think i did sell a
kangaroo in the last run
she said explain yourself
[Laughter]
i think i did sell it after that believe
it believe it or not you probably
believe it
hurt me
i think we keep this frozen man i don't
mind keeping that bad out there just in
case
we have tier five animals like what if
we unlock because if we have tier five
animals i'd love to see some experience
i don't even know what i would be
pairing right now
you need to level something up in order
to get the boost i understand
roll button shows us could be tier fives
okay
okay
three
two five two
him me him him me
freeze me
roll me
she's loving it man
honestly i'm a believer in the can me
strat
wait a minute or am i a believer in
microbe
which will purge all their debuffs but
will maintain melon armor afterwards
am i willing to lose a swan which has
done great for us
to be honest
because the poodle's some nice scaling i
don't want to dump that this does the
added benefit of getting rid of one of
our two
tiers yeah sell swan
oh my god
kate got me uh
the largest corn dog i've ever seen in
my life oh my word
holy crap
spicy
i'm looking forward to that oh my it's
so heavy
oh man that's hilarious
my god
should have canned first i don't know if
we could have done that in order now
that i think about it but um
so there's no point in putting garlic on
anybody now
you should be unfrozen
economy doesn't matter freeze me
roll me
shakalami
shakalami
you gotta t-rex me okay so you're gonna
freeze me
for now the poodle's gonna buff
following this we're gonna sell our
goats
when we sell our goat we're gonna buy a
t-rex
the t-rex is gonna give us the scaling
we need and all three of these units are
gonna get melon armor
we don't need to give them garlic
because they're all gonna be made weak
okay
that's the strap man that's the freaking
strat
we might lose this round but from this
point onwards things are going to start
to look very nice for us hey nice bat
you got there oh no
two enemies have weakness oh no
everybody has weakness including your
stupid peacock
oh wait none of my enem none of my units
have weakness anymore
cause i'm amazing
hold on
hang on here
we still win easily
can me
sell me
juice me
we need to be at three gold or higher
so we can't really do anything except
roll twice
will freeze me
they're still good this is still good
freeze me and roll me once
we don't need another turtle maybe
splash on the micro but i don't know
freeze me here
oh
baby
nice deer uh for me to poop on
oh no i'm weak
oh no you're oh wait a minute hold on oh
no you still gotcha
oops my melon armor
oops
uh little oops for you
this guy's kind of a piece but we still
got him
i'm glad the microbes finally getting
the respect it deserves
juice me
don't make me laugh we could dump the
poodle because we have scaling
but everything is getting hit this is
beautiful
we would like if anything
we want the microbe to get a stake
we can only buy one thing
buy me some pizza
yummy yummy yummy
oh
[Laughter]
1516 level two total
you know what you you've you've
countered my build
a little
yeah okay you've taken away my my
biggest advantage this will probably be
a loss
we're lucky we're getting
we're still punching
it'll probably be a win actually is what
i meant to say
i don't think we buy cans now like we're
already scaling so fast that the cans
are
sub-optimal imo roll me once
we don't see anything we like
if we don't see anything we like we got
choices we can roll three times or we
can can i'm telling you we're not buying
anything new we're gonna roll three
times
it's it's the play
i mean i guess you could freeze a micro
it's kind of unlikely you're gonna make
it
pill microbes
it's an interesting
concept
he said about
a one-up turtle
uh that
then
gives out two melon armor
seems useless
uh the only way i can see it working is
if like the second turtle kills
something that erases all of our melon
armor and then it dies and replaces the
melon armor on top but
anyway it's it's unlikely
we'd probably
deploy our resources elsewhere
who frees you though
oh the microbe takes off the one up uh
takes off the one up anyway
yeah yeah this is for win 10 man this is
crazy
1819
this is a nasty squad no doubt about it
they do lose their melon armor though
on the 3636
this chicken is kind of a it's a counter
to what we got going on at least it was
only a level one
this only blocks 20 so
36 36 we we lose okay sorry we got stuff
to play with
we got lives to play with we're scaling
i'm not worried about it we lost uh kind
of on stats that time
roll me once
god i'd love a freaking poodle man
it's a very easy build to pilot right
now
what the hell
it's the same build but i think mine's a
little better it's like the same build
we still got the punch a little yeah we
win
probably
yeah yeah yo baby 10 wins
pay out the believers on that one
there's a new style built for us we
actually we we ran a micro build in the
past
oh baby
um but we we got rid of it before the
end now hey we've proven
you can at least give it a roll you can
give it a try
cheers to that i'll drink to that
brother
that's pretty good
that's pretty good
that's pretty good all right run the
bets back
look
i'm a variety streamer okay
but i'm also a simple man
i see 8 200 viewers in a chat that loves
watching
super auto pets it's very hard for me to
not just play more super auto pits
it's doing very well for itself it's
it's just fun man it's just it's just
fun
yeah pretty much all of it ends up
on on the old youtubes as well
as as we like to call it in the business
it's a weird start but
sure
we're begging for some wario ware i
don't know man i don't know but it's so
it's so fun though but it's here's the
thing is like this game is good don't
shoot my ants you're a piece just so you
know
pig pig pig me pig me
you peace whatever
it's double peoro build
this week yeah that's one reason i'm
like
not totally sold dude one of the reasons
we won
so well last time
is because we won early like those early
wins were big helps
so i'm honestly i'm gonna tell you
this is a straight up
real situation we sell you
you buff me
we buy you
we buy ya
we freeze you we roll you
we buy ya
we ant ya
we roll ya
we accept
dude the beetle can get kind of scary in
the early to mid game
a 2 3 is nasty
this is good
our front two trade for their front two
then we beat you
then
we live that's a win
caps are making them look angry i don't
disagree there was there was some anger
involved there
so it's definitely a
it's a pump it's a pump
that's not that bad
i think it's a pill
before you pill
no you can't do it that way well you
know you could hold on you could sell
beaver first
nice buff
run the chick there
freeze me
get you next time roll me
sell me
bat me
it doesn't get any better than that
early bat and uh
the ultimate beetle
we trade you got a 910 fish please
weaken my 910 fish enemy
at least we we get something out i mean
i was i'm like he's got a 910 i'm so
upset but i'm like i guess i got a 911
so
we still lose
that's a nasty team man
no that's an above average team we're
not gonna run into too many more teams
that are that strong okay
i'll live with it
roll me
i believe in a drama dairy just listen
to the rhythm of my heart
okay um
you buy one fish freeze the other this
is a springboard for us into the future
there is a part of me that's like you
know what we could do
try something like this instead roll me
one time
freeze me one time
garbage garbage team please
eleven five at the back a little spooky
but
oh
pov you're eating my butt
one in five baby
[Laughter]
oh
this good stuff there's good stuff right
there yum yummy yummy yummy
got you got to roll bison it's not even
a contest
so we're going to sell this son of a gun
you got it it's got to be done
we're gonna buy you
now
if i buy you and put you here do we get
the trigger
yes because it's a buy not a summon
so it totally works
but we could also
sell a fish
by you
we could do this in any order i don't
know why you're
being so weird about it
for
for now
sell me
juice me
yummy yummy
roll me one time hence maybe freeze me
and roll me one time hence
combine me
buy me freeze me
this bison's gonna pop the frick off man
i know it's a buff buffalo has the
narciss prince
you know what i'm talking about you've
played super punch-out
owns
not a big deal this is a draw
it's a draw but we're scaling
you love to see that so this is a it's a
pill me
it's a garlic me
i think it's a
roll me
so freeze me
it's an unfreeze me
it's a freeze me
it's a roll me
it's a freeze me
it's a roll me
it's an intern
sell by him you
yo you got to freeze the snail man
it's just science
peacock week is good buffalo week is bad
but
oh it's not going to be much of an issue
it looks like
actually we might draw
[Laughter]
all right great team name by the way
that that puppy did some work for you
see you in the future when you're
scaling and i'm scaling and we're both
scaling him me him him me
oh we got it we gotta try
we don't have to try the fish though
it's not that kind of place
we're not gonna get a level three friend
you jus you say no to that
what i think you do i think you do buy
and then i think it's not the worst
thing in the world to have a bat that
hits hard
you got an eagle already
level two bat you're a piece you're a
piece
this blowfish is gonna hurt me pretty
bad
that's actually like probably the best
that could have gone this is a loss for
sure
we would have drawn if we'd had one more
hp
don't don't worry we're scaling that's
what i'm saying we're scaling the scale
you you you get out of here you stink
you own
yummy yummy
romy
we need some garlic on you let's be real
we also need some stats on you but we'll
settle for garlic right now meat could
have done it as well
freeze me
freeze me
it's our last life man this this one's
big
1011 rhino we're looking for rhino
infanticity please
we can
do something
we can thank you at least i think
whatever
it's not that bad
i think this could be a draw
can i just ask you how you got a
caterpillar to pop so quickly
because i'm just going to be straight up
with you it seems kind of like like like
bs seems kind of like bs
we gotta hit you
now we start getting some turbo buffs
you need stats
i think the fish
you sell the fish to buy a poodle
after all that
yes
i hate the sound man
and then we we need some benefit this is
a good buy but this if we don't buy this
this could be goodbye
yummy yummy yummy
1011 please
please
don't weaken me not at the front not at
the front
oh we might have a chance
we needed to not get batted
i'll take it man
yummy yummy yummy
yummy yummy yummy
yummy yummy yummy
yummy yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum
yum yum yum yum
it totally works freeze me
hit me one of these two is gonna get
freaking rolled man i know what you're
thinking rooster rooster him me it
doesn't get buffed by the poodle
unfortunately
freeze me
freeze me
roll me
juice me
i think it's more important early
that you get the bat
sauropod
we're not really on a food build
i'm happy to have a tier six don't get
me wrong
why not buy the bat instead though
i'm going to become the joker
does that answer your question
this is a loss
[Laughter]
even if we bought the bet we still lost
but yeah that's a loss three wins four
losses
it's all right it happens i'm telling
you we're going for at least another
hour
start my predictions and then also we'll
put a slash marker
sap 3
take a bite of the corn dog



it's freaking huge man
it's too big
i love it though
new hat
pamela head
i think we need this we need to wait
until we can buy the golden poop pad
like it's such a flex
we're gonna go back to free to play
temporarily
this is a squad
this is a squad man
we like a cricket
that gets buffed
with a horse
and an ant and a duck
the bumbling fingers
the order doesn't work dude if you buy
the horse first everything else gets
plus one plus one or no it just gets
plus one attack for the fight i want a
qriket to be 2-3 for the long term
that's a permanent statistical bonus
mind you it still leads to a draw here
is it it's permanent oh well disregard
that then
what do i know
buff
roll
it's permanent it's not oh it's not
permanent shut the heck up
you liars
don't even know what you're talking
about
yummy yummy you don't this this run does
not lose
like look we got a full squad we got
full stats
any stats gained in the marketplace
screen are perfect or are permanent i
should say
okay well if we have a two-two
duck in our arsenal then you're not
trucked if we don't have a 2-2
duck in our arsenal you'll excuse me but
i might be sending you to the trunk
this this one is a loss though
their horse beats our horse stuff
mcgruff
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
thank you
appears to be a 1-2 which is a little
surprising
unless you're saying like maybe when we
bought it it was a zero two
except for the fact that
it's not a zero two obviously because
there's a one so what's up with this one
then
it's okay i'm just asking you to say
sorry i would i'm not asking you to
apologize for being wrong i'm merely
asking you to apologize for saying
you're absolutely right i have 100
confidence
and then being wrong if you were like i
think it's like this and then it wasn't
that's life man everybody makes mistakes
but if you're like it literally is
permanent three question marks
that's all i have all i ask is for some
humility and some understanding okay
now you get sold
you could roll a dog build here man i'm
i'm like so on top of my headphone cor
hold on a moment please
hold on a moment
dawg we've gotten some good wins with
dog lately
it's only round three
there's nothing wrong with that
now the order on this one is actually by
sell
buy
because the dog will get a plus one plus
one from the duck instead of just a plus
one or
zero one
so
buy
buy me
sell me
4-4 dog
nothing wrong with that
exist me
5'4
freeze me i respect the three seven
peacock that's pretty good freeze one of
these we're not gonna be able to do
everything we wanna do
that's okay
you know what we could actually if we
i'm contented to sell an otter
even at 2 3
to buy a peacock
to buff the dog
to swallow a fly
we want the best chance for the ant to
hit the peacock which is
um hold on
look
it's a little goofy okay but there's no
reason you can't there's nothing in the
text that says
a dog can't play basketball
the only thing is now if we're putting a
b we kind of miss out a little bit
so i think i'm willing to run my chances
actually with
this
this this
be me because we can't put a b on our
we could put this on you we can't run a
b on our um
well you know what actually if we pill
you this will give us a nice buff on the
dog so i don't think that's that i think
that's actually accidentally good
but we can't put the b on the cricket
because it won't summon a cricket
okay
have you discussed the most imp you
piece
have you discussed the most important
news of the week
your
uh super not super mega baseball but
nintendo switch baseball
youtube short reaching 1 million views
yeah it was crazy when i saw that
i don't know uh i don't know what
algorithmic like hot sauce it got
attached to but
it did cross a million views the one
where i i throw them the mind eraser
short's algorithm is like it's out of
control man so we dump you
yummy yummy
yummy yummy yummy yummy then we sell you
sorry sorry thanks for being a part of
the organization
which means we actually could pill you
to get a summon for one but then we
would lose a 3-4 which is not amazing
you know i actually kind of like a buy
yummy
followed by a cell
yummy
and then a freeze into a roll
now if you're gonna roll this
personally i think you roll two horses
and then you combine the peacock
you save the pill because i think it
will work nicely on a cricket i mean for
like one gold we pill the cricket it
gives a dog trigger then we sell the
cricket that it creates and we get our
gold back that's a bargain man
yeah i don't know the baseball video it
went it went thermonuclear man
this is uh upsetting i'm pretty sure we
draw here
alas it is what it is
when triple platinum which you think i
sold them all
now there's something to be said about a
turtle everybody loves the turtle
excuse me
there's also something to be said
however about a flamingo
excuse me excuse me
him me him him me that gives us a sick
buff
turtle did so well for us last time it's
hard for me to not say yes to a turtle
let's put a turtle in front of our
peacock temporarily
and i also feel like
a
bee on the turtle why not with three
gold why not
it buffs our dog
again now we can kill the turtle for one
get a dog trigger get melon armor on the
peacock and then sell the bee back to
the shop for one
we know yeah oh okay a level two horse
surprise surprise how exciting
big whoop
this is an interesting one that that
early rooster scares the crap out of me
but our peacock is going to be quite
strong
it's going up against
that that ox is gonna is upsetting for
me but i still think we we trade it
i think we draw
i think we draw
just barely
you peace we lose i forgot that was a
horse has other benefits okay we had two
losses two losses
life goes on
freeze me
horse me
screw you
pill me
thrill me
chill
kill me
thrill me
selm
sell me
roll me
buy me
try me
[Laughter]
what is going on here i'm a little
confused too
just to be honest with you
that's a good start kangaroo we need
this kangaroo to get strong enough to
live through
the otter please
i'm skeptical about that one
uh if as long as it trades with the
otter i'm not sweating it too much
oh it's gonna trade with the horse
that's so much better
this is a win
at least your dog isn't exclusively
health this time ain't that the truth
man
ain't that the truth
that was i i felt like the game was
broken when that happened
so it's a this is a sell me
i'm all i'm just being real with you
okay i'm honestly like this is a buy me
you get
a buff you get a buff you get a buff
and then you're gonna thrill me
i think you're gonna
smell me
now a deer is not so bad that's that's
like freezable i you know what i think
just for this one
you can roll
a deer
and then pear me
i prefer the kangaroo behind our peacock
right now
this dog's only an 11 11 11 though he's
got a long way to go
hmm
this doesn't seem that bad
because our splash damage is gonna is
gonna do some serious work here
that's not that that's actually a dream
come true
because we we ate your buff with our
melon armor now you got a 2-2 sure your
dog's getting a little stronger big
whoop
now our this is a win
that's even better for us honestly i
think
no well even better is
it's not even better but it's okay
then you got a b that doesn't matter at
all
then you got a cricket that doesn't
matter at all
and then you got a dog it doesn't matter
at all easy win
certainly seems cannibal
and remember we have a flex position
it's our deer
the deer is good but it's not part of
our long-term game plan it's good in the
mid game it's not part of our long-term
game plan nor is the horse for that
matter but i think
you can sell me
buy me
i'd really love to get to a level two
dog
roll me
it's
disgusting
sell me
buy me
freeze me i guess roll me
hippo me
how do we buff our hippo that's the real
question it's it's turn 8 is a little
late
freezing
sorry i was a little hungry
have you really been playing auto pets
for three hours not only that i haven't
even gotten up man
like i've literally just been sitting
here
like deliberately dehydrated myself
before the stream
our kangaroo's dead man that's a
disappointment or maybe it isn't
it's barely
not just glued to the herman miller i
took a shower before the stream so i
wouldn't have to deal with my own stink
now i'm eating a 3 000 milligram sodium
corn dog
dude this is like
this kangaroo is is is
you know what now that i look at it i'm
actually scared to death of this shark
yeah we lose this after all that we lose
this
what a shark man
so we only have one life left to live
we know it's a cell
and then we we hope it's a bye
then we're gonna unfreeze you
eight nine is okay
give him some garlic
i really think our only hope i mean this
is big we
if we're not gonna buff the the crap out
of him forget that you're a piece
roll me
you could sell a horse
you know i'm selling a horse ride in the
cowboy
it's it's just this no it's not enough
it's not enough to get us to the snail i
wish that it were
i mean i think you'd
pray for the best
it is if you sell the dog too i'm not
willing to go that deep
it's a little too spicy for me
well our hippo meta has failed us don't
melon me though don't you okay you peace
you don't mellow me you peace
we trade with the kangaroo we got a
turkey and a shark that's a pretty heavy
f potential
yeah that's a loss
[Laughter]
why do you know the meta
and yet you haven't even made an account
yet
from this point onwards
i resolve
we're never gonna try horse build maybe
early game will run hoarse but i got too
attached to it
a lot of the problems you run into in
this life
are due to uh
are due to over commitments no doubt
about it
it's an interesting squad you know you
want ant
we can freeze both of these try a very
simple one re-roll
i mean i'm gonna be honest with you you
roll double duck man
i don't care to keep you
maybe i'll keep you frozen for now
the flooded flexible fossils
it's my nickname for
helen mirren that's not that's just mean
i'm sorry
sorry ellen my mistake
don't shoot my ants please
all right
we draw we draw
we draw that's fine crunchy fossils
versus flexible
freak you man
i care about you
sell me
sell me
freaking freaking 5-4 fish bud
freaking 5-4 fish bud
we have to buy the horse okay
the reason we have to buy the horse
is because
yeah we have to buy the horse we need to
fill four spaces which we can't really
hold on let me think let me think about
this okay this is a this is a buy
everything
you start a horse we really want to win
this round
then
ideally
fish would get hit by the beaver level
up
[Applause]
which would happen right here
this is a nasty squad man this squad is
nasty
you do not even though we've only got
four you don't want to roll up to this
squat that's not a beaver that's an
otter my mistake
don't shoot my my otter
all right well
nevertheless
owns
owns
owns best of luck to you
fish is like the most underrated front
unit man it's it's pretty it's pretty
spiced
i'm gonna be honest with you stats are
not the worst thing in the world
so you can roll
an elephant at the back
just for some wins
he gets buffed
he gets buffed
we then fish once
we see nothing that appeals to us
as a result
we give you a little meat
and a little squeeze i think this is
we're headed for a 2-1 here this is a
strong build here
should have made the ant buff well
actually i like the idea that the ant
could buff excuse me level two horse
already you peace
all right i just
i'm revising my goal down to a draw
thank you
owns
owns never mind we win easily
great name though loose legs great name
it's very simple
i'm going to need you to pill me
it's not really what i was looking for
but that's okay following this i'm going
to need you to thrill me
peacock elephant i don't respect
i have respected it at times in my life
i don't think i respect it right now
however
we are you're right we're a little
starved for options so our most likely
units to stick around are peacock and
fish
let's buff the peacock
fish is already pogging i'm buying more
food this time
what an interesting build you have here
we don't mind that we don't mind that
i lived
the cricket's gonna kill us but that's
that's life man
then we get a superior trade
we get a a nice trade you create two
enemies
that will not punch through my fish and
we're gonna win
i thought you were against horse build
we were forced
that we had four things to buy 12 gold
and 4 empty spaces we had to buy
everything that's the only reason we're
on horses right now i'm looking for a
reason to get rid of them
rabbit food is interesting
i'm gonna give it a try okay sell me
squeeze me
eat me
that's food
garlic's food
peacock me freeze me
dodomi roll me
we stand to gain nothing from that but
that's okay
might want to move our units around by
the way do we still take one from the
elephant every time even with some
garlic but that's okay that dodo's gonna
do some work for us next time
big
whoop you peace
dude we do we we trade with the dolphin
or we we kill the dolphin we trade with
the aunt
no we don't deserve garlic armor
that being said this is a draw but still
three wins one loss one law zero losses
it's a simple pog me
it's a very simple pog me
it's a roll me
you you know how we do it the otter goes
gets replaced with a kangaroo at some
point this dodo is going to come into
play
you know you know what you know run
puffer fish behind elephants got some
interesting plays too
we got two hertz synergies though i
guess an elephant that gets upgraded
would hit twice you know what in that
case freeze me
unfreeze me roll me
freeze me
interesting
very interesting idea chat very
interesting
what's that kangaroo doing why you why
don't you wait two seconds to see
this is not ideal
this is a strong build the warmish
buttocks they got a strong build we
lived thankfully you're gonna summon a
heck of a chicken here
we're gonna live through this though
which is incredible for me and then
you're gonna summon another chicken
but then we're gonna kill you
and
we're not even trading dude the garlic
armor is doing incredible work and we're
smacking you
and now our kangaroo's kicking the crap
out of you
that's the greatest garlic armor you're
ever gonna see in your life
screw it dude let's try
that being said a rhino freaking rips
man
sell me
buy me
i don't love anything maybe you do it
like that instead
so that the kangaroo has a chance to get
a couple triggers
salad me
freeze me
i think we're gonna end up selling the
rabbit for a rhino
but i don't know how i'm gonna get you
how i'm gonna get you you pumped you
know
how am i going to get you pumped
because you don't get the buffer i guess
we'll just buy some food for you in the
future but
this will be weird
sorry i'm corn dogging it
well
that's pretty bad
please
that's okay this will be weird
please hit the dolphin oh you peace
we take one we take one
and we beat you i don't believe it
all skill baby
five wins
it's a simple turn
for a simple man
buy me
buy me
buy me
roll me
freeze me
i don't even think we freeze a can man
not an ideal start a rhino will perish
you peace
this looks bad
and yet
let's go
snipe that melon armor all right it's
still pretty good
is it
is it pretty good
we came so close to drawing just your
freaking level two kangaroo man
if that was a level one we win because
you're a level two we draw
oh dude we have so much life left to
play with i'm like i'm pogging
okay so our kangaroo sucks but they also
maybe have just had some bad luck
so i think for now we like we like the
squad okay
you get sold for now you get bought for
now
we roll once
you don't say
can me
sell me
buy me
feed me
freeze me
everyone just
shut the hell up for a second okay
they don't synergize okay
i'm gonna do a sell me by me though uh
the penguin only it makes our elephant
plus one plus one better uh look m the
peacock eventually but i prefer this for
now
13 12 you peace one day
one day this rhino is actually gonna get
to work
the day is not today this looks terrible
for me
shoot that chick please
you peace
yeah this is pretty bad
this one just never had a chance
[Laughter]
we if if our rhino lives through the
first enemy we are pogging okay
it's just never happened yet we didn't
have space for a next level unit to
spawn
buy me
i love that
buy me
this is a sell me by me
but we could do it next turn
so that we at least get some little
benefit out of it right now
that's a freeze me freeze me
live
just live if our rhino just lives man
just get one kill
oh
it's a level one deer this might be the
dream
this might be the dream
get killed get smacked
get killed
get smacked
get hit that's fine dude
except for the splash damage that was
pretty sick
[Laughter]
but then you're a 13-27
you peace
this rhino is a piece of garbage man
hold on everyone chill okay it's gonna
be fine just gotta win one more for the
believers
take one of these
take one of these
roll me
don't talk to me okay
don't talk to me
don't talk to me
i don't know where they go
i don't know where you go man
i don't know where you go
28 29 rhino
he's gonna start popping i see the buffs
i see the buffs okay he's popping
he comes back as a piece of garbage we
kill you anyway
you're all getting buffed
congratulations i'm happy for you or
whatever okay i see the buffs coming in
guess what you get smacked
good smack
then smack him
come on we gotta punch through a little
bit man
it's not enough
it's not enough
you peace
right we got five wins and then like
four straight losses
it hurts but you know what we're running
it back
we're running it back because it's that
kind of day this this freaking garlic
man the garlic's out salad
i know i said i'd never go horse again
but on the other hand
i um
i am
a freeze a yummy
what can i say
i think we win man i know we win
look at that
creamy pencils defeat withering bamboos
by me
quaint
buy me
freeze me
buy me
you're going to get sold you're going to
get sold one of you is going to live
roll me once
don't care to level up a pig maybe we'll
i think we just chill on that
this is a round two win as well get
ready
three animals
what's wrong with you
you're never gonna win with three i mean
maybe if you had like a
like a 6 6 or something early you could
make it work but
that's pretty hot man that's a hot play
one thing's for certain
we love this
early dodo that's buffed is pretty nice
then we kind of love this to be honest
then i'm thinking i'm a big believer in
this
i gotta be honest this is a bit of a
nasty fish
normally i'd be like all over the ant
but a 3-4
that's actually a 4-4
then you freeze me this damn cupcake
then you buy me this dodo
then you play the cupcake on the dodo
four or five fish you piece of junk you
piece of crap
this looks
this looks okay
now the horse build begins
we don't need much
there we go good win the naughty
organisms
this is a romy
don't don't don't do this we're not
rolling horses long-term okay that's not
the strategy
this is not the strategy i'm invoking
now a peacock
with a little statistical advantage
early is kind of pog
i was just stupidly
hoping at some point
you might give me a copy of something i
already had but what was i thinking
i'm i'm just going off man
i'm going local
it literally gave you horse and fish
yeah but they suck
have i discovered the secret to pogging
just buy a dodo and give it cupcakes
we're already up to four wins
oh okay okay everyone chill out
blanca
the dodo gets buffed every turn
combine me
peacock's still pretty pog
just gonna be honest
maybe you sell a horse now
slide the dodo back
run a little peacock up here
run a little penguin back here
roll me
freeze me
roll me
is that's a freeze
sell a fish get a giraffe up there next
time
maybe
no cupcakes this turn though oh [ __ ]
you're you're not wrong no no cupcakes
level two mosquito
honestly like that penguin was not gonna
do anything that's probably the best
possible outcome for me
this is a loss though that that pig's
very strong the unwashed teapots
they're rolling penguin build too
they're they're penguins buffing that
mosquito give you they'll give you the
respect i'll put some respect on your
name right now
sell me
thrill me
sell me of course
this dodo is a 7 8 by default that's
pretty amazing
giraffe n turn buff the dodo i don't
care to buff the dodo though
i care
to buff the peacock i think because the
dodo getting buffed
wait oh no it's n turn you're absolutely
right my mistake
that's my mistake
we're going to start like this
it doesn't have to be to the side that's
just it's just science
pop me in
i i i know i understand what's happening
here okay just give it a sec we want
something like this
or the penguin it doesn't really matter
then we're gonna cupcake the [ __ ] out of
you
[Laughter]
that that cupcake is a nice value add
man
i thought the giraffe was buffed the
dodo every turn it's it's buff the dodo
sorry buff the
dodo every turn in battle it's not it's
buff the dodo every every time you begin
a round of auto chess
is don't get me wrong it's a bit of a
nasty blowfish here
in fact like oh frick that's horrible
you peace
they won't do it again
you peace whatever i still win get owned
thanks for the cupcake
five wins
did i say tier six animals oh tier four
i'm also unlocked okay
sure yeah um
you can go
in exchange for you
in exchange for you
roll me
i don't see a cupcake
i do see a dodo
i know i know what you're thinking trust
me it's better rolled up it's better if
you roll it up
i think we're gonna go it's a temporary
kangaroo but we're gonna go kangaroo
temporarily
i don't i don't really feel and need to
roll the food for the time but we're
gonna do it like that
we really want garlic armor though
garlic garlic armor is like the next top
tier benefit here
peacock's going down unfortunately
never mind again i can't do math
as long as our kangaroo gets
some
hp that's the only thing i ask for
because obviously their kangaroos
getting stronger here
you oh my god you summoned a ram you
piece
that literally i'm you can't even be mad
like that's literally just like
congratulations like god smiled upon you
what can you say
all skill baby
deer in front of kangaroo does work but
it kind of it cannibalizes a bit of our
build here
cannibalizes a bit of a milk
i like this okay i like this
i really want a peacock man
garlic armor is going to win us the game
forget these scumbags
forget them
forget him man
give me garlic in peace
what the hell is this
[Laughter]
okay five five bus actually just bodies
my kangaroo
that's terrible news
this seems insanely bad
i will fast forward again
my points i if i were a believer i would
be i would be concerned about your
points i would be i'm not gonna lie to
you what's the point
we're past that
you know you're gonna need this
holy [ __ ]
for now
a giraffe being sold
just we just need to win
one round
for the believers that's it
we win one round for the believers
then everything's cool man
everything's cool
i don't know what we want to live longer
i think maybe our kangaroo not getting
splashed would be a nice addition to the
squad
forget this forget this man
the fly is gonna make the kangaroo
better if the kangaroo lives through no
deer no deer is nice
what the heck is this
what is this squad
it's only a level one dodo
this fly
thank you thank good you tried
hey you're soaking up some uh extra
damage it'll be relevant at some point
this is a win okay so the believers we
made it we made it we juiced it we
squeezed it
and can i tell you now we got garlic on
this peacock up at the front
i saw her face now i'm a believer
not a trace
of doubt in my mind
the croc of the the
shot everyone shut up
the kangaroo gets sold
in order to or the penguin
kangaroo is sold
in order to roll shark
which behind fly is gonna freaking
own dude
now i'm not gonna lie to you
it's not the most optimistic penguin
i've ever seen in my life
nevertheless
persisted
snake build
a little scary on the snake build
because it could snipe my shark pretty
easily
but if we could just get the shark to
scale
oh [ __ ]
this is a nasty one
good smack that had to happen no garlic
armor on you this oh frick not the shark
oh [ __ ]
get him dude not the shark you beast
that's also really bad you peace
we're so close
if we had a little room to work with
there we would have done it but you know
what
can't be mad
we did get six wins or more
still six wins
believers get paid
we're rolling it man



but i'm like i'm
this we've been in a game drought for a
bit
it feels nice to be on the other side of
the game drought and and be enjoying the
pure pog
it does
wasn't there wario today
yep
we're the dry mouths
if they want to make me play more
warioware then they can make the
challenges good
instead of bad
okay
how does that strike you how does that
tickle your fancy
i'm dodging puro yeah make it an auto
battler
plus we're probably not even caught up
on the amount of time we played wario
where
when you look at the amount of time we
played
super auto pets is my guess
buy me
buy me for now
roll me
sell me
you peace
freeze me roll me
buy me
unfreeze me send me no
don't send me unsend me
that probably won't make a difference
but it could in theory
i don't mind a horse getting a little
stronger it doesn't bother me too much
we live
we trade
i think this is a draw
i think i actually used to win my
mistake
yeah there's going to be a lot of super
auto pets on the youtube channel over
the weekend because it's all i've played
on twitch
which is not true we played slappy ball
and gardic phone yesterday
but yeah we're in we're in an
unprecedented era of non-variety just
temporarily
sell me
combine me this is risky we're taking a
risk
you're a piece
you're a piece
we can
we can buy you just to chill at the back
roll once
i'm going to be honest with you i don't
mind having a 4-5 on the squad
freeze me
make me stronger than yesterday
i think the rat blows i do not think the
rat is good
but
it fills up a space
and it's the stats are okay not great
but okay
you know what though
having a dirty rat on the enemy team
prevents the cricket from summoning a
bee
might help us this looks like a loss
though never mind it totally doesn't
all right that's a loss that's fair
enough
i thought it was going to screw up its
capacity
hello dodo
hello
newman
sell me
buy me
sell me
stats are okay
dodo me dog me
peace me you peace
i hate this [ __ ]
roll me
buy me
kill me
i don't know man
a ram is pretty good
that's that's a not bad situation but
it's not that amazing either i mean we
spent a lot on nothing
not at the front what's wrong with you
there's not even any reason to have it
at the front
shoot my aunt oh that's the one time i
wanted to shoot it so that we could have
the space
oh no okay at least the kangaroo is not
great
at the front at least
god this would be this would be an
incredible draw man
holy crap
we did it
still two wins one loss
early deer
kind of sick man
um
i think we want to pivot hard we want to
pivot hard here
we're going to sell
a pig and an elephant
in order to roll
a turtle and a blowfish the order is all
screwed up
you need to go on you
i don't think we're going to roll sheep
long term i think we're going to start
working it out of there
an ox i don't trust
melon will override garlic you're
absolutely right you're absolutely right
not a big deal
good smack
very good smack
acceptable
this is a win man
somehow still cruising three wins
we're not rolling rams we're not rolling
crickets
we're rolling in general i still think
we keep a garlic up there just for
just for safe keeping
and you know what i like you
and you know what
i'm gonna be honest with you
i hate to sell you but i love to thrill
you give me a kangaroo behind a ram
it's going to get a lot of triggers off
of the sheep minimum
freeze me
roll me
freeze me because i want you to buy me i
want you to buy me and then we're going
to accelerate through on the next one
kangaroo's going to get a little garlic
now we want no
splash damage that's a 10-10 pig with
the fedora up at the front
that's that's something you don't like
to see hey we're screwing up your spider
a little bit though
the pig is gonna die
the snail's gonna die
we kill the rooster we scale past it
we kill you
we scale we kill you we're scaling
we kill you
you're lucky you're like you peace you
peace you're not lucky get owned
that's value town
unfreeze me don't even know why i lost
the confidence
crocodile me
seven damage to the last enemy i feel
like there's pretty strong in the
free-to-play world
feel like you end up going up against uh
a lot of turkeys
a lot of horses a lot of early dogs but
hear me out here first i want to see if
i can get a
pill so i can get the melon armor on
this
i'm willing to go pretty i'm willing to
go down to four
in fact i think i'm going to go down a
three
or i'm going to go down a two
i'm willing to go down to i'm willing to
go down to four
acceptable
that's where we have to stop it because
the next role a pill would make it
impossible to purchase
goodbye my friend
if you give me a pill i'm gonna flip my
freaking lid
oh
i'm flipping my lid for a different
reason altogether that's i'm not even
sweating it man
i'm not even sweating it we don't care
about this anymore
hippo has screwed us a couple of times
here i don't think the hippo build is
the play i think we're we get level
three blowfish we focus on getting the
blowfish
to pop
maybe get something that triggers the
blowfish put some garlic armor on the
blowfish now
okay it's a strong kangaroo
you're lucky you're also a piece
go ahead
make my day
go ahead
make my day
okay owns
this this peacock is getting pretty
strong yeah this is not looking great
six we need more than six it's not quite
good enough yeah this is a loss
it's a strong build
you know what wait we have stuff to play
with right
this is we have one life left after this
no we have two lives left
that's fine man
you don't have to start canned food here
because it doesn't benefit
us on that purchase
you can freeze canned food roll once
see where you stand
hello my friend we meet again
this is an easy buy in my world
no scaling is bad
ah
it's hippo at least it's only a level
one
the turtle i'm not happy with the snipe
because the turtle just happened to
exist but
this this hippo is going to scale out of
control man
it gets two per kill
hmm yeah it's not looking great
how dare you
well
turns out that the turtle in the back
was a pretty shrewd maneuver
the sheep blows yeah we don't like we
need to find a replacement and we need
the money to to
finance it is the problem
and immediately like okay here we go the
only problem is
do you believe in cans
i think you gotta
try sell me
four four deer still unlikely to
accomplish basically anything
like i guess you roll a penguin
temporarily
this would be
a surprise against the turkey sheep dog
build
this would be a surprise
this is looking pretty horrible
bit of a nasty squad oh my word
no no freaking garlic yeah that's that's
an l on this one
it happens
i'm just gonna speed it up a little bit
okay four wins four losses
pay out the doubters
you know the bets are set nicely because
we're constantly running into two
different comments one is why do i ever
believe and then the other one is six
wins is too easy and it just happens
over and over and over again based on
literally the most recent data point
i'm going you know like
you just stay on one build until you get
pissed off and then you move to the next
one so i stayed on
uh
pay to win until i got pissed off with
bats and then i went back to free to
play and now i'm pissed off with turkeys
so now i'm going back to
pay to win to get pissed off with bats
again
it's not a bad start here
i think you're more likely
oh sorry i haven't started my prediction
yet
we can freeze a cricket in case we like
it we're gonna put it up here roll me
again
beaver's not a bad cell
so unf unfreeze you because you stink
the beaver we're investing in round two
basically we're investing in round two
i think you you get a believe in the
bird that believes in itself
we might lose round one it happens
for the illegal ice cubes
two four three four that's hell man
as hell
i think we draw
a bit spooky
then
it ain't no lie baby
sell
buy buy
roll
what's the best well we can have some
banter today okay what's the best
song from the boy band era
bye bye bye
i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you mine okay
mine is a slightly different answer
freeze me
don't freeze me we're getting level twos
next time
um
mine is larger than life by the
backstreet boys i i think they
i think they brought it on
on larger than life
like that's maybe the only song from the
boy band era i would ever describe as
going hard
it's another draw thankfully
the creamy bits track one on the on the
backstreet boys best-selling album
millennium larger than life
i guess i only froze one of them huh
well if we're not gonna tear up here
then we like this guy didn't listen to
five baby when the lights go out every
single word you cannot express my love
and tenderness i'll show you what it's
all about baby say you will succumb to
me so baby come to me when the lights go
out as you think i didn't listen to five
just because i wasn't born in essex
just because i've never shot a music
video inside of a bowling alley before
act like you've been there before
i'm looking for a gift for my aunts i'm
looking for an ant for my aunts i guess
we should have bought flamingo instead
what was i thinking man
the hell was i thinking
you should be glad you aren't from essex
you know what give me this
one of the ladies on on
too hot to handle is from essex
i don't think i've honestly understood
like it's not her accent it's literally
just the the words that come out of her
mouth i'm just like
we gotta we gotta get this lady like um
like a my fair lady type situation man
she's i i apologize this is regionally
insensitive i'll stop short of saying
it's racist but she'll just say stuff
like i left a dinger in the loo today
and i was like lady you're wearing like
a
a bikini right now
i don't want to hear about the fact that
you still got a you got smoke coming off
the barrel of the gun
like okay everyone chill for a second
i'm thinking
buff me
freeze me
squeeze me
parched
me
i live in essex it's not that bad better
than vancouver anyway
it's crazy um i mean you might be right
i doubt it
do people that are from uh outside of
essex routinely say things like oh yeah
i'm from essex
in bc if you're not from vancouver
island everybody's like i'm from
vancouver and then i'm like oh me too
where do you live and they're like maple
ridge and i'm like shut the [ __ ] up
you [ __ ] liar
i wouldn't actually it's just a it's
just an emote
squeeze
pill bird me bird me
you bird
roll me
flamingo me
you know what no no no screw that man
screw that
sell me this is a mistake but then swan
me
you wanna roll swan here
and then i think we're going to keep
this swann for a bit
so let's do it like that
not going to lie i'm feeling pretty good
right now as a doubter okay i mean we
have some scaling
if you if you feel good more power to
you this double peacock's got me a
little bit freaked i'm not gonna lie
never mind it's uh inconsequential
um okay never mind we are going this
this caterpillar is going freaking [ __ ]
wild man
we lose our first round here
you peace
i just need to level something up please
this is a roll
this is a juice and a squeeze
if i dare say so myself right there
nice that's a big buff man
roll me
roll me freeze
freeze me roll me
sell me
buy me
kiss me
no bats
no bats some strong units here i'm not
gonna lie
the dry sailors
oh you are you're getting some some good
intel off that don't get me wrong
but
feeling good okay we're back we're back
one and one now we gotta go six four but
that's why you don't look down on a
cupcake in my house okay
tier 4s
finally don't mind if i do you're a
piece of crap we're not going to get to
a next level bison don't waste my time
hello chibly chibly check this out
corn dog
isn't this like your generation's
favorite food
i didn't even post it on instagram how
does that make you feel
genji
it's not a threat i was stretching my
lat stretching my lateralis process
i'm just thinking okay
i think we do
i think we do this
even though i understand the complaints
i don't give two hoots about a bison
we buy you for future considerations
honestly give me give me one of these
freeze me
freeze good freeze good freeze get good
i'm not sold on you anymore i'm not sold
on you
here's my impression of george harrison
i got my
got my i'm my fish i'm not sold on you
my fish have not sold on you
oh man
you peace
well that's bad news
we lose to the peacock exclusively
thanks to this bet
that hurts
that's just pain there's not much you
can do about it it's just pain
yes
now i know
every previous time we've tried this
it has failed but this time
this time it's gonna work
this is the this is the one man we can't
scale it though we gotta we gotta leave
it at the front i think i think he's a
front front facing marty
yeah he needed that cupcake please
please
dear maybe oh we do really well against
the bat
don't weaken me it's level one your
peace you peace
why are you such a peace man
are you kidding me
you know what we trade this is a draw
thankfully
i hate this damn bat man
okay the beetle and the fish are both
leaving probably the beetle first the
fish has better stats
the rhino needs buffs
no sweat
none of these matter like it's you know
what a turtle
turtle probably is nice on snail so
let's start there let's let's start
there this is this is what the swan
gives you
rhino at the back is honestly is just
too bold for me to consider it
but you know what i will consider
melon armor
on a rhino
i feel like it's slightly too late for a
buffalo man
not much
just slightly
i mean
we're gonna get absolutely destroyed by
a bat
and you know what i'm here to tell you
i'm here for it
one one bat ruins our life
oh this is beautiful no bats
no bats
that's still kind of nasty but
all right at least we got the oh
no
that's all right
that's all right
we lose this one
yes
we do still lose this dude we gotta we
gotta get out of here this is are we at
one one heart remaining
holy crap
this is a disaster
dude this rhino's got a scale
this is hell
um
all right so all we got to do is pop off
it's not that hard probably
we should have you at the back if you're
gonna get some advantage here okay
probably we don't need you um
rooster is what you do if you wanna
scale i don't really wanna scale i wanna
live so
that feels nice
and then roll
and then sell me
and then buy me
and then juice me and then squeeze me
and then sell me
and then buy me
and then sell me
and then
freeze me
and squeeze me a little freeze a little
squeeze a little cheeky scorpion to keep
you in the game little cheek oh he
should have frozen a pill too but a
little cheeky scorpion to keep in the
game no bats baby
well they expected this thing to die in
one hit and oh there is a bat i'm
actually just stupid
um
double melon armor
we draw
not good
freeze me
roll me
i need i need a rhinoceros please
i'm i'm going heavy for a rhinoceros
you peace
i'm like we can't even really peel the
turtle there's nothing to do with it
do we really like a scorpion at the
front though i don't know
a 1-1 scorpion it does so badly against
like deer and stuff like that i don't
know what dude i'm honestly like i think
believe it or not i think you sell
turtle by bat you sell the turtle you
buy a bat
because the bat can make the rhino
head to the freaking moon
you're a piece
weak unit at the front is not what you
want to see please weaken the peacock
oh it went right over his head i was so
excited
we take those we don't take those you
take this should call me in the morning
you peace
this is not a draw this is a loss
that's fine throw in a quick first off
pay out the doubters
i can't believe i've been sitting there
for four hours and 16 minutes we got one
win
start prediction will analgesic wins or
more
slash marker
play arena here we go we're back
fish stays
bird buffs fish this time pig is good
enough to hold
it's good enough to squeeze
we're not going to sell it this one
we'll sell the beef well yeah no we'll
sell the beaver on the next one this is
fine
unfreeze me
unfreeze me
end my turn
the crisp kilts
hasn't won all day i still believe um
excuse me
are you [ __ ] serious we got a 10
piece
early on this very string
you can dub scale
don't hit my birds you peace
oh
buy me
buy me
i hate that sound
don't freeze me
next turn is gonna be
sick when i get out there's gonna be
carnage in theaters now
big whoop
it's yet another draw
blue build is working though man you
ready it hasn't even started yet
now it begins
a chunka
tachanka
the earliest puppy you're ever gonna see
in your freaking life
we want so we can spend five gold which
is not a nice number
that means we can we can go pretty heavy
on rolls here
try to get something a little all
conducive to our success
like perhaps that for example we can
roll once more
honestly i think maybe you
i think you freeze nothing
oh
i like this so far 13 6 is a little
spooky
but are you even gonna
are you going to last long enough to hit
my puppy
yes you are this is going to be a draw
it's a draw but we scale
draws or wins when you scale
we still like it
i'm going a little heavy on rolls here
one more didn't even think about it
that's fine
that's fine we don't combine birds
yet give me one of those
oh 10 6 puppy
level 2 man
i don't know what to say
i guess they'll say what i often say
you peace
anyway we draw
and we scale
you obviously you're buying a puppy
that's just it's non-negotiable
i don't care for a ram
i do
like a tropical fish
do i like it enough
i think i probably do
i love your scaling though man like
let me do it like that
roll me
i'm gonna make a controversial decision
i'm gonna swan me
three three two one one him me that's a
that's a freezable scaling build
this is we have an engine
well we have a hulk
you're a piece
little melon armor this is going to be
tight we might lose to the b honestly in
fact we're going to lose before the b we
don't care though because a loss is a
win because we scale
two gold lamau okay this one's for you
ai trees twitch uh twitch uh prime user
if you have two or more gold game plus
two or plus two or plus two n plus two
at the end of your turn
so i guess you were just laughing
because you're so happy that we're
keeping two gold around so we could
scale so easily this is probably the
explanation that i would imagine
i treasy
la mao
i'm oh wait i'll wait okay i'll wait
all right
now
you're gonna come by me
three three two one
swan's gonna stick around for a bit
so we're gonna play this
then we're gonna play this
we can buy one more thing and that's it
we should make
our bird hit a little harder
i'm okay with that
you see i just love seeing all the buffs
it makes you feel like you're doing
something right
you peace
man
owl
we sleep
we still win this i think
yeah yeah definitely okay there we go
i'm surprised danielle hasn't banned
anyone today i'm having a great time i'm
i'm loving life man
it's turn seven you could sell a
tropical fish and run a caterpillar here
that'll scale very nicely with our puppy
is he lying chet i'm julie i'm not lying
i've been having a great day
weather's nice baby's cute what more
could you ask for
well a billion dollars okay sure thanks
five hours of super auto pets
very little complaining which is
you know honestly
pretty fair when you consider
you know what
the fact we played the same game for
literally the whole freaking stream
we could probably get rid of our birds
soon
i don't know if we replaced it with a
with a chick though i think we would
just chill for now maybe freeze
is this a good time to tell you i won't
be live on monday either because it's
canadian thanksgiving
but you know what that means i promise
you we won't play super auto pets on
monday
on stream
easy wins easy wins
has he gone for a break or stood up this
whole stream
no
i have i've eaten
80 of this corn dog though
i like where your head's at
what about a turtle
to override weakness on the dog maybe
yeah yeah yeah
take a five minute walk to
um
prevent blood clots
no i have one of those things you see on
the infomercials i'm pedaling every
stream
i basically i've i've run the tour de
france like eight times this year
already and i came in first
every time
get owned oh
baby
no shot
honestly can me
and then scan me
this is just a weird one
i don't want to buy anything that
cannibalizes our buffs
in that case i think we'll just keep the
cow out there we'll roll once or twice
to avoid cannibalizing
any buffs i don't even want those pears
man you peace
yeah yeah prefer to stay here dude this
caterpillar is getting mighty close
nice level one deer i think that's gonna
do a lot of good i'm not there's no need
to be rude i apologize
you are gonna lose though
i mean like look you don't even have
anybody on your team doing 30 damage
like what are you thinking my swan just
wiped you
my swan
it's not even out there for stats it's
out there for gold
what are you thinking
anyway scale me
anyway scale me
anyway sell me
and then freaking scale me dude
double caterpillar could have been sick
you're not wrong
but this is going to scale with our
level 2 poodle which is kind of crazy
now that's a sound
possible
possible play
i just feel bad man
what a what a shot
oh man we got a level six unit t-rex
already huh well my tier two dog just
smoked you no big deal hmm four wins
okay
we're not gonna roll a long-term swan
unless it's stats keep pogging i don't
know why that has like a
why does it match we're not going to
roll up all right
unless your stats keep pogging i mean we
could wait for like another caterpillar
or something you're still getting buffed
man
you know what well you're a tier three
you're a tier two
the buffs from the poodle are strange
now
i don't really want to sell a swan yet
i think i could sell a leopard and buy a
portal but then the leopard's getting
pogged up honestly unfreeze me and roll
me
i'm going a little deeper
you might as well
sweep
we're not gonna go for a level three
we're gonna sell it soon honestly you
don't need this you're already pogged so
like shut up
i think we want to buff the crap out of
you
he's already going to hit max stats so
i'm not sweating it at all
tier four
rooster
it's only gonna get plus two plus two i
don't think it works
i don't think it's worth it yet
i think you're gonna freeze me we got so
many lives to play with right now i
don't think rooster's the play i think
it's i think it's a little late for
i i don't think we have the scaling
engine to get rooster to pop
specifically
i'm unafraid
you peace
talk about value
you peace
we win easily again
can't wait for you to choke
you know i'm not the like running the
animals right
i'm doing the hard work like i'm the
animal's boss
um
so you should take this melon armor
can me
roll me
we're almost at the end of our scaling
adventure
if you give the caterpillar something
and it transforms it loses the buff
unfortunately
i gotta level with you
the problem with the dragon
is that we have no space to put our tier
ones when we buy them
so we have to sell the swan to get the
dragon then we have to sell something
vital
but if you sell the swan and you get a
rhino
i know it screwed us every time
but it'll become
just shut up for a second okay you sell
you get it i know
it's gonna get plus two plus two every
turn okay shut up shut up shut up
and it's also gonna have melon armor on
it
i don't care about the scaling this turn
i'm investing
i do care about this i don't care about
this
the puppy doesn't we don't need the econ
strats anymore the puppies already like
nearly max stats
what the heck is this it's a squad of of
four
okay you're a piece
you peace whatever we broke your armor
i'll settle for that
nice try
nice try
oh 1-1 versus 48-42 you beat me earlier
defiant
now they're all gonna pay
we have to try
again let's let's remember
we're really digging deep for these
animals here
another leopard
we don't care for economies
for the time being you might as no you
might as well not freeze that ever shut
up melon armor
no cupcake no no no no no
dude
semi-spicy team
except for that
let's go bat countered
level two blowfish sucks it's probably
gonna take our melon armor at some point
that's life man it don't matter
it don't matter at all
dude this is a possible 10 win
no doubt about it
it's certainly doable it's too late for
a double caterpillar but i admire your
enthusiasm
you need this
freeze me
well if i'd known that another one was
coming
then it would
no no uh so i'm just gonna be honest
with you okay i'm gonna eat this corn
dog
since that first octopus run
every time i've seen the octopus from
that point onwards it's been terrible
it's gone okay get over well there's a
little no that's just where it was fried
we don't need it the poodle is very
important for us to scale up all of our
units well really these three at this
point
the octopus i someone in chat said it
and i agree i believe that the octopus
is a false prophet right now
this is a spicy team
is that that
buffalo at the front is a little spooky
but
well it's very spooky but after we get
through that
i think the world becomes quite
oysteresque
it's actually not that bad at all
this is looking fantastic man
you need a little slice
no thank you
roll me
it's not as good ever ever i i love the
cow too okay
people think you buy the you sell the
poodle buy the cow give something plus
two plus two and then plus two plus two
terrible strategy this poodle's giving
plus two plus two to everything right
now except for the freaking caterpillar
which becomes a 50 48 anyway starting
next turn but a melon poodle
now we're talking okay
and then honestly
just buy me one just that's adjusting
case bye
i don't dislike the start here snipe
them
you
it's actually pretty good
i get that you're coming back
but guess what take one of those and
then i'm killing you and then take one
of these
nice scorpion
and then i'm killing you okay you're not
taking another one of those but that's
fine that went very well
nine wins baby
nine wins
one loss
really we're not fishing for much
we're only we're fishing for two poodles
or three rhinos
or three leopards
um so i'm like
honestly i'm kind of a believer in just
buying some some sushi
a little bit of it went to the dog but
that's okay
and then honestly like
it's a just in case
oh god the scorpion
you're lucky we still we got the chick
killed but
we have melon armors i don't know if the
scorpion no scorpion will not kill us
this we we don't lose i mean this this
is a win
it's that simple
oh 49 tough luck
just one shy but i can put myself in
their shoes 49 is probably good enough
only one level of max hp beats that well
and i'm spent
yeah i don't know if our dog ever
attacked in the entire game
that was a heck of a bill
the crisp kilts okay we're gonna pay out
the believers as we just did we're gonna
run the same prediction
hey team on 19 thanks for the gifted
subscriptions
one for each win
we're gonna keep it rolling here i'm
gonna do a five hour stream where i just
play this game the whole time uh

though they should the yeah they sail
from port to port
classic man
another classic bonmo
from austin powers himself
our economy game has gotten so much
better
unfortunately no we can roll a full
squad here
freeze me something semi-useful
this is also not bad man
do this is
this is good stuff
i we win this i don't even i just look
at the numbers mason although you do
have a b
um
we lose these we draw these
the numbers mason my favorite quote from
lost
whatever we scale
who cares as long as we scale who cares
sell me
squeeze me
febreze me
hey turtle the tim
thank you as well thank you
the gifted subscriptions thank you
you're not gonna love this part okay
maybe you will
maybe you will okay
shrimp me
no
sell
no
shrimp me
sell me
hedgehog me
i hate to give the head you know what no
it has to go there there's no other
options just accept that that's the role
that it was born to play and it's gonna
play it
and then
buff me
which buffs you buff me buff you
these stats are pretty spooky man
i don't like to see a level one blowfish
they're running a shrimp build too it's
going around you peace
whatever
you get pieced
get pieced
get pieced we drop
thoughts on netflix announcing at that
70s show spin-off
i don't really have thoughts
um but you know what's funny
has anyone else ever realized that 70s
show ran for more seasons than the real
70s did
you want to see something messed up man
oh you hit me him him me
oh that was fun oh no him him me him me
okay okay
oh man
what the [ __ ]
so we do have kind of like a food build
here also we can only roll three units
that's not great or four units i should
say however
swans kind of sick
dude pig plus shrimp is a little that's
a little dirty that's kind of a dirty
strategy
pay one gold to give a random friend to
hp
this is a nasty team hey i'm trash tell
me you're good without telling me you're
good
this is a loss
that's okay
because we're scaling man
what am i doing
i guess i'm buying
and then i'm selling
and then i'm
buying
and then i'm selling
and then i'm buying
and you know i'm selling
and then i'm buying it but i'm not
selling
instead i'm just going to eat some salad
i mean eat some salad
this is weird
i don't know about this one
yeah keep buffing that swan that's okay
this is a build we've never run before
which is just buy and sell things over
and over
okay i see a bat it doesn't matter too
much what it hits as long as it's not
the front so that's okay
that's okay
that's nasty
but that's okay
and that's okay dude this beetle is
freaking nasty look at this beetle man
hp you peace we're going to draw are you
piecing me
i thought for sure we won that
we're it's the wolf of wall street build
incoming
well this time you're gonna combine me
we're gonna roll
you're gonna buy me
you're a piece
we're gonna buy you
we're gonna garlic yeah
we're gonna
we're gonna roll
this is a big freeze this is a big
freeze
we're gonna roll
that's i love this i love just to see

are part of the day trading build
we get a deer out there just to live
12 21
garlic armor bluebird
what about the chick what about the
chick they're just lucky they haven't
been sold yet i buy and sell
tier 3 units at a level one 20 times a
day without even thinking about it
oops
hey i'll take a hey i'll take up the
biggest 72 ounce t-bone steak you got
your piece
that's me i'm mr moneybags here um
selmy
buy me
sell me
yummy yummy
buy me sell me
don't buy the pigs are you crazy
it's one gold for two hp man
plus i get to say by me
over and over again
this this
freaking shrimp has been running buck
wild man swan me
can me
buy me
don't be stupid
roll me
can me next turn
cammy next turn
oh man
what a build
you're not wrong some goats would be
insane
what is he doing we we we're running a
day trader build i wouldn't expect you
to understand mom
nice nice splash damage on your deer
sorry i didn't mean to be rude
well you really got me
i almost had to use my shrimp that time
i don't see how i couldn't okay
i don't see what kind of a person i
would be
if i didn't do that
the shrimp has been so good to us
in the face of such incredible insults
from chat
that i i don't know what kind of person
i would be if i didn't pay it forward
big whoop
is that a level two deer wow you're
almost a piece honestly not quite
thankfully
hey that's an interesting goat bag i'm
not even being facetious anymore it
actually kind of is an interesting goat
i wonder what you got going on with that
that's five wins oh man
oh baby
i'm just gonna be honest i know i could
buff you i'm kind of like you you know
what we could do we could peel ya
and then just buy another one
so you're kind of uh you're kind of an
econ build
i think i'm a t-rex boy here
the sauropod is better for money
i guess we'd probably be dumping this
soon
or now
now
sell me
chunk me
buy me
we need to keep three gold or more
so honestly
splash me
buy and sell beaver you peace you're a
genius
next pill we get this this mammoth is
not long for this world
that's a nasty rhino up at the front man
oh that weakness is pretty nasty too
honestly
you're gonna kill yup yup that's fair
not him though not him not him me him
this is a loss that bad that bad did
some scary work that's a loss
okay where are we at here five five wins
two losses
first loss in a bit i'm not gonna cry
about it or whatever
i would like to fish
i think it's a little late for the bison
but then again can i tell you something
i think the bird can go
pretty soon the shrimp actually probably
right now the shrimp can go
although it's done great work
it's really early to get a leopard out
there too but
it's 13 15 but
you know
hold on
level one bird there's never going to be
a more painless time to sell it
or a less painful time to sell it then
him me
him me
then
freeze me
roll me
stake
me we're not gonna be doing as much
buying or selling
as you've as you've seen before okay
roll me
roll me
shrimp me
freeze me
mammoth me
garlic me
pass my turn
there's some scaling being done here
the swan will go at some point soon too
i don't see
oh you peace
i was like i don't see any uh early
danger uh that changed pretty fast
okay we gotta we gotta make some bold
changes
we we had a huge peak in the mid game
and now it's all falling apart
little a for the octopus man my points
it's not octopus time we don't have i
mean it is 12 12. maybe it's octopus
time
i must think
we don't have to sell our swan this turn
okay
sell me
buy me this is a hail mary i'm not gonna
deny it
garlic you
keep this frozen keep this frozen roll
me
you're a piece
roll me again
you you gotta look at
a t-rex
you gotta look at a pill
you gotta say screw the scaling this
turn
no because you'd scale this guy so he
gets stronger next time
whatever you're not going to get any
you're not going to get any scaling
you're not going to you don't have any
scaling
then why are you not what are you doing
then what are you doing then what are
you like why are you doing this
you could sell a swan get to seven gold
and then buy two things and be in the
exact same spot it's not a good plan
give me a gorilla
and then a roll i i hate that we screwed
up the scaling this time
but it is what it is
1010 gorilla don't get one shot man
don't get one shot
well
it's not a whole i oh you level three
bat piece uh
this is bad for business
i can't believe it i can't believe it
we're paying out the doubters
you see the what a squad man
i was so convinced too
we won you gotta admit though
him him me him me him him me him me
wall street bets build
in the mid game that was doing some
serious work
you know i think it's probably like a
good lesson to be learned about day
trading
you can go on a real hot streak but
eventually you know the law of large
numbers
comes out with a big scythe and goes
anyway let me make sure my wife is good
to go
um
are you good to stream
smiley face
it's a fun experimental build i do i
have to admit i gotta use
the bathroom a little bit right now
donkey donkey donkey dunk the donkey
donkey donkey donkey donkey
that being said that was fun i had a
good time i hope you did as well
i can't wait with five hours the super
auto pets straight man



hey everybody welcome back it's super
auto pets and we're we're doing our best
that's all i can say you know what i
think is the best is when you see uh an
ants in your shop immediately followed
by another ant
and you could actually roll a beaver as
well
let me let me be the the the bumbling
bits
that describes my content pretty aptly
so one thing i've done in the past is
get a lot of ants which gives you a lot
of buffs you know run them wide instead
of running them long but another thing
that's kind of interesting
what a shot
i think that means we lose actually
because of the way the buffs shake out
here oh no we draw thank god um
you could also
create a level two ant quickly to get
another leveled up unit maybe
for now we could do this okay and i
think we can also do this
and then roll once we're looking for
something that combines
the the only thing is
when we combine them
we won't have the money to afford the
other unit okay so i think that what we
do is we say okay beetles are going to
stick around for a minute so let's buff
a beetle
oh
okay
for this turn no for life okay
interesting um
maybe roll it like that so we're gonna
have one pretty sick level two beetle
which we're then gonna use to get either
a level two or a level three unit i
don't know
great minds think alike as you can see
i and i'm not trying to um
you know sandbag i just look at this and
i say to myself this is quite the squad
that's not what you want to see
but we do draw okay i mean
i thought we were at a higher
probability of a loss there but
sometimes that's how like an auto chess
type game uh bears out right so the
first thing i want to do is
this right here which then did allow us
to get a tier three on the third turn
which seems
surprising
i think you can then roll tropical fish
which is
better than you would expect
i think you can
combine your ants i know this is not
like the meta play
then i think you can roll bird here
i think we're gonna freeze these two the
cricket's not long for this world but
now we got a nice we got a a six seven
beetle at the back we got some buffs
happening in the interim period i'm not
upset by the way this looks we got some
scaling
uh i i don't know how we're gonna punch
through that peacock
i guess we'll see
this does mean that we're we're trading
there you're gonna get me
i'm gonna get you
i'm gonna get you
i'm gonna get you and then we're gonna
win because of the rat
would you look at that
the rat is nasty man it's a four five
this is dangerous but
now forget the bat for the time being
let's let's peel this ant okay
eight eight
flamingo could be a 4-2 that when
fainting buffs the units
i think we buy one freeze the other
although to be honest with you we could
buy the other
seller cricket
roll a bat
does the bat need extra hp yeah probably
it's more likely to stick around roll me
once
freeze me this is exactly what we wanted
we now have a nine-nine level two beetle
now we're talking maybe
are we talking i don't know
i like the way this looks to start with
though
that's not the weakness you're looking
for i see where they were going up
against the 10 10.
that's freaking too too cricket man okay
so we lose this one
because of that 10 10 fish i mean that's
a nasty fish man
what can you say
we're at one in one no sweat one one was
scaling it could be a lot worse
so what do we like the most
we're definitely going to stick with a
bat for a bit so let's get the flamingo
back here
give me a quick buff
another bat is very important
i think
i love just having a turtle on the squad
and i think you can invest in making the
turtle a little better and i think you
can actually freeze the pill if you want
to to get some more melon armor out
there but that's about it now is this we
got to think about the way we want to
roll the squad here tropical fish
is buffing bad and bird
we really want the melon armor on the
beetle
you can you can do this for now
and then if we wanted to we could faint
the turtle give mel and armor to the
beetle right off the bat
and then move things back into the
position we prefer okay i see a bed i
see a little silhouette of a bat
weakness at the back is insanely good
for us because the turtle's just gonna
completely counter it
um but also like everything else about
this sucked really bad
i think we draw though which is
something actually we win no
we draw we're lucky to have the draw
quite frankly
what what a beetle at the back man
what a beetle at the back
um
so there is
melon armor
then
we can roll it like this again
but what are we going to put up at the
front
we don't know yet
puppy turns six you think it's a little
late for scaling i don't know i kind of
disagree right now let's roll me once
eight roll me roll me once more
spider is is always interesting
i mean i think for the time being you
can put a puppy in the shop
see if you're happy where you stand
if you are then roll one more time that
was bad um we we essentially got like
nothing out of this
but our puppy scaling has begun i don't
know it might be a little late but the
puppy did amazing work for us last time
the the thing we would love to see
changed is to make it like a two a level
two early if possible
we basically traded junk weaknesses
we're gonna draw again
barely
but yes
okay this is a draw build man but we do
scale again this is we're hoping to
crest at some point puppies please
no puppy
different tier animals we have a one we
have a three we have a three we have a
two wave of one you're a four
give a one one to different tier animals
so the bird in the beetle wouldn't
necessarily get buffed but you know what
i think we can sell a fish
roll a poodle
unfreeze the pill for now roll again
you're a tier three tier three we we
love that you're getting a double buff
here you're a tier four which means i
don't think you'd get a buff which means
i think
we roll
i'm basically ignoring scaling which i
would not recommend
you're a tier one what's getting dumped
first the beetle or the bird probably
the bird
so let's not invest in that bird right
now let's roll once
dog come on man come on
you're not the right animal
i it might seem insane given their stats
right now but i think the puppy's gonna
want garlic eventually
let's go
i'm giving it my all man i'm getting i'm
giving it a chance
2 3 versus a 4-3
pretty bad it's not a good start
that didn't matter thankfully
um this puppy's gonna have to do some
work man
i still i think we
i think we win no we draw cause of the
meat
but we draw with scaling that's my motto
okay we're one and one on round eight
so there's that um
i need to say it this is another roll
situation we need to upgrade the units
we got i i think we're a little late on
llama but i don't think we're late for
canned food we only have one loss
or a little late for buffalo i should
say turn eight you're a little late for
buffalo really you're a tier four i
don't love the tier four
i'm hoping to level up a unit we got you
know what
that's how we roll
let's let's invest in losing this time
in the hopes that we're gonna upgrade
our cans to like insane levels for the
future
this is not getting any easier let's be
honest weaken the scorpion please please
our dog has been weakened which is bad
because it was wearing garlic armor yeah
this this should be a loss
but we do have melon armor i don't know
we
actually
my word
we're gonna win which is kind of
disgusting
um but it is what it is that takes us to
2-1
honestly i think you can me we know
we're selling a bird soon to get
something better
it's not the amoeba but it that is funny
um you could
if you sold the bird for two three you
can get a swan at a nine ten
seven that takes us to four
i don't think the swan is the play but
let's freeze it for now
just in case it ends up being the play
and the swan is tier two two two we like
that our bats getting buffed we have a
tier three right the puppy yeah we don't
want the puppy to get compromised
you can roll one more time if you get
something you like you simply sell the
bird
you freeze this so you don't ruin your
buff this turn you unfreeze this
you know what you
do tier three
i would prefer if you didn't take the
buff we sell you
buy the owl
knowing that the owl
let's go
let's go knowing that the owl will give
us a buff when we sell next turn then
we'll start our next turn by leveling up
the bat which should give us a new tier
of animal that we can put in the shop
right now we're very lucky
that that was not lucky but
you know the prior to that there was
luck involved we lived through this
which is beautiful how we gonna beat
that puppy man
how we gonna beat that puppy i guess
we're gonna beat that puppy like this
and then are you are you kidding me
we're starting to build we're starting
to build a little bit three one
so there's some gimmies here
we upgrade you
dragon a tier by tier one animal give
all friends plus one plus one so this is
interesting the problem is we have to
find a way
and we're gonna sell this for sure we
have to find an extra space on the
roster
in order to fit tier one animals and
none exists right now
but that is crazy but then i'm also
looking at a rhino
and i'm like you know like a rhino
at 11 12.
tier 5 is going to get buffed plus a
chili splash attack to hit the weak
units at the back like
everything's getting buffed every single
turn here like the scaling is starting
to hit please don't kill my rhino right
away
this this is workable weakness on the
garlic rhino oh oh so close
that's all right we still get a kill
here
and the nice little splash attack
you're so lucky
[Laughter]
we still win which is surprising maybe
to some people not me because i knew we
had it that takes us to four
we're now at tier 6 animals
i mean you know you're going to freeze
that chocolate we know we're going to
try to scale up our rhinoceros
we don't have a tier 3 we're unlikely to
get one
the beetle is it served its purpose
hither to this point the puppy like if i
can get that puppy to level two man oh
okay freeze me
freeze me
squeeze me
good weakness and this rhino goes
infinite man i'm telling you
weakness on the front rhino
let's go that's huge
weakness on our bat
weakness on our beetle not great
sorry we still get a kill here which
means we get a kill here which means we
get a kill here and we're still winning
and we're still scaling
we're winning we're scaling him him me
him me him me me me
send him
send them
of battle
deal 50 attack damage to a random enemy
um
i really like this i think we can sell
our beetle
which is a tier one
and then roll our tier six leopard
instead this is a temporary downgrade
in search of of a future
big time upgrade
so it's gonna do six or seven damage to
a random enemy but it is a 1311 itself
we just need to give it some melon armor
we need weakness on the front peacock
please
i'll take it
saved we're it still sucks for a second
but at least we get through there which
allows us to then punch through here we
do die here
this is uh this is a loss okay i can
take that but we only we lost by one
unit
and i think that's to be expected now
that we've pivoted our scaling a bit i
mean i'm just going to level with you we
got a roll double rhino
um and i think i
misrepresented our rhino build i think
that the rhino should actually have
melon armor
i know this is gonna screw up the puppy
buff for one turn
but for them to get a kill
without dying we should have rolled one
more time too
if we're gonna be under the gold
threshold anyway no bad no okay bad
don't make me lose my melon armor
please
please
you peace
you you actual peace
we take
that's nasty
we do kill you
we don't kill you
we kill you
you kill us all right it's good
that we were not gonna make it through
that chicken to begin with either so
we're on our last life here
i know it might seem insane i i kind of
still think we're like
in an okay spot
i think the melon armor was a reasonable
investment
roll me
hit me
freeze me to get that puppy going now
just dude i'm telling you no bad or if
we hit a bad please at least just be a
level one because this rhino could
freaking it could roll me it's a level
three are you kidding me
it didn't hit our rhino
so there is that
but then we we dump your melon armor at
least and then we trade
then we trade
then we live
and we live and we win okay
so again
i'm okay with this whereas six wins
i think you should still keep trying to
build out the puppy if possible
i mean i feel like maybe mel and armor
on your cheetah could could get you out
of a jam here steaks are pretty good i
mean they're scaling on the t-rex don't
get me wrong
you think you could sell your cheetah
because you still hell i don't know
maybe the poodle's coming to the point
where we don't need it maybe you could
freeze two t-rex's get ready to sell the
poodle and instead run a t-rex which is
essentially just works well with the
puppy to begin with
confirm i could have rolled one more
time i guess but
please a draw or a win here i'm telling
just no bats man
no bats
i see no bats
replace all of their stuff please
replace all of their stuff we did
replace some stakes
thank you you get knocked out which
means we smack you you lose your melon
armor which means we get to hit you now
this is not great for us but that's okay
you're gonna lose your melon armor
the turtle's gonna die
you're gonna get some melon armor
and then we're gonna get you look at
that we win again
somehow still holding it together
yes win number seven
on a run that continues to scale i might
add
i'm investing very heavily in our
scaling so if we freeze at three this
would be nice don't get me wrong
three is where we stop three is all they
get please
please
this has ten win potential we just gotta
basically win out no bats no bats i see
no bats i do see a blowfish i see a 50
50 bison
we are gonna kill the blowfish
the rhino is not gonna get to pop
however the peacock's gonna go down
you're so lucky man you're so freaking
lucky oh you're so well i don't know how
we were gonna get through a 50 50 bison
at the better buffalo at the back to be
fair so fair enough fair enough i'll
settle for a seven win marty to open
things up today
that's not bad man
and then we'll then we'll run it back
here
now i love a 2-3 i i love a pig
basically
um because they sell nicely
i think we actually like the ant is more
likely to give us a win here okay
but i think
yeah i think you do it like this i think
you freeze the fish so you can maybe get
the level up
i'll be the silly pants that's that's a
phrase people say
the lazy chunks i'm a simple man
i see no ant and i know that we're not
gonna get an early loss here
the ant is just it basically creates an
unkillable unit you're not killing a 4-4
on turn one so i i don't count myself
you know good for that i count myself
lucky but i will take it
now roll me
i still like a bluebird
after everything we've been through i
still like a bluebird and you know what
i'm going to give you the ch i'm going
to give you a chance
i'm going to give you a chance to to
live by buying you some fruit rather
than just invest in some rerolls that
are probably not that good uh this looks
bad
maybe it's not that bad actually
yeah this it it's a
holy crap that was a level two and it's
a draw against joe mama 69
consider myself lucky on that one so the
way that you'd typically roll this
man it'd be so nice to get a fish so we
could get an early level three but you
like
how hard do you want to go right i think
this is how hard you want to go just
it didn't hit the unit i wanted but
that's okay we can roll the dromedary
temporarily
i definitely do like a flamingo
and then we can fish for one more roll
i don't see a good reason to not just
roll two dromedaries freeze another one
and then this guy is going to have so
much like statistically next turn he's
going to freaking dominate
we may lose this fight we would for turn
three we're a little underwhelming but
we have some scaling built for the
future
i know i'm i'm beating that scaling drum
pretty hard i don't see how we win this
i feel like you could maybe get a lucky
draw
that's
that's fine actually because we still
trade here
no i think this is like a guaranteed
loss
yeah yeah yeah i mean we didn't even
really get close but this was an
investment in our future plus he had
that cool fedora man what are you
supposed to do
so i have to think um
i think we go like this
and then
like this the bird is more likely to
stick around than the fish
than this
a puppy
we we are going to roll the puppy just
for the record
uh and i think we're going to make sure
i'm i'm willing to sack
a loss right now we'll roll once
i i know you're like it's the same squad
i'm willing to sack a loss just to make
sure this puppy gets started on the
ladder
the puppy is has been part of a lot of
great runs for us so i do not say no to
it
that doesn't matter too much i think
big plays
big plays
big plays
big plays we win okay that's that's good
we we won with a a 80 active squad
we got two bats which is crazy
um we definitely want a 4-6 bat out
there
thank you to our dromedary
the fish is going to get sold next by
the way but do you sell a fish to get a
peacock out there i don't think so
but in that case
we're not doing anything
you might as well roll
might as well freeze me
might as well freeze me you might as
well roll me
interesting
i think you can freeze the chick for now
i'm not i'm not sold that it's gonna
be part of the squad but it could be
part of the squad temporarily and if we
can get it to a level two quickly enough
i'd be pretty happy
but we're gonna get a high level unit
hey that's big we're gonna get a high
level unit pretty quickly
um because we're gonna get a level two
bat next turn which could create like uh
uh this is an unfortunate draw because
we were really close to a win here
um
we might get a tier four unit on this
turn
and we do have the double check here
look at this okay so you go you go bad
you get a tier four rooster
the rooster you sell the fish okay you
buy the rooster you don't focus just on
scaling the puppy for now
and then we're not gonna roll the chick
then we're gonna focus on buffing the
rooster
because it can it it's basically like
having a super b at the back why don't
we give you some garlic armor for future
considerations
puppy's still popping man puppy's still
getting plus two plus two every single
turn
as a level one
one one deer that's bad
because that means our bird will not get
a chance to attack
but we did honestly pretty well there
i think the weakness gave us a certain
benefit and would you look at that we're
gonna come out of this one
smelling like a rose we're at what three
wins one loss
you definitely want another rooster
that's a gimme
the dromedary is probably not long for
this world
as similar to the bird by the way so let
me just think about this for a second
because you could roll
um you could sell the dromedary
or sell the bird you let's just say
hypothetically you sell the dromedary
you go to nine gold
flamingo six
five gold
buy a level one dromedary
i don't know
um
all that just to downgrade a unit and
get a plus one plus one on everything
well i don't know i mean i i i think
it's a little late for that play to be
good
we probably do just as well making you
plus one plus one and getting you
possibly closer to
leveling up to a level three if that's
something we decide is valuable
we can roll once
i freeze you just in case unfreeze you
buy canned food
and freeze garlic the the frozen garlic
is still good i think we always want to
make sure we're buffing the puffy
the puppy
the lush bushes uh ruin this turtle's
life please please let's go that's
enormous well not really because now we
have a 16-19
dog we gotta find a way to punch through
um i mean this
this is a draw no the fish got us if if
we almost had it be a draw that's fine
so we're two losses three wins
yum yum yum which is good
in in a way
bluebird synergizes super nicely with
the rooster but i think it's time man
like the dromedary also does some great
work for us so let's get that out there
everything gets buffed
swan does work with puppy i'm not gonna
deny that okay
so i think for the time being
we could at least have those function
together
we don't have a level three friend at
some point we'll get one
but that point is not right now
unfortunately
i don't know i i feel like our scaling
is petered out a little bit but uh the
the rooster does really well when they
get upgraded
it seems like a good start for us
we don't quite get like a two-for-one or
whatever or the dog is gonna pop off
that's gonna be a little nasty
but i i don't know i look at the
situation i see our rooster and i'm not
too worried about it as long as our
puppy gets the kill on the dog even if
we die it doesn't matter because we
summoned an 11-1 at the end and we did
not die
so we're at four wins so we've already
we've broken even at worst this has been
a pretty good run for us lately you need
the rooster
now leopard is kind of tempting it
doesn't fit into our like scaling build
um
yet still
still that's there's some temptation
there or you could sell a swan
which admittedly is not long for this
world
okay so i do think you do that then toss
me a leopard in here freeze that that
chocolate there's no doubt about that
i don't mind putting a quick little
splash attack on our bat just in the
hopes that it does well as a result
we're we're scaling
attributionally but we're not we're
descaling like an orthodontist
um
please hit the front hit the front hit
the front with the weakness let's go
i don't care if the back is weak that's
not the end of the world um
we're descaling financially and that's
the that that's a problem but look at
this we're still cruising here like we
the puppy needs to be leveled up in
order to make them
you know worth using i think long term
but
rhino is very interesting as well maybe
instead of a leopard even though the
leopard
also has a chance to scale nicely but i
feel like a rhino could do some serious
work man
i'm gonna try it
roll me again
puppy is important in fact it's so
important
i'm really tempted to give you the
experience
yes i know if we still had a swan you
would be toasted right now i guess
there's no point in giving you the
experience on this one i feel like we
should freeze this for this guy as well
and instead we just roll for greatness
and i don't see greatness but that's
okay we'll freeze it here
the the chicken the rooster is not
scaling as fast as i would like here but
it is creating two twelve ones on death
okay so we're going to lose all of our
effects when you die
which is not great
but we did get to kill you which means
oh you get melon armor but we break your
melon armor
we hit you we hit you
we hit you we thankfully don't die to
this
which means we kill you which means we
win on the and that was a rematch feels
good man now we're pulling out of this
what are we at six wins okay
tier six animals online haven't we been
rolling tier six animals for like hours
uh you need to
roll this t-rex
and then we put this on the rhino we end
our turn everybody's getting buffed
everybody's getting scaled
everybody's getting juiced and
everybody's getting squeezed okay
i
i love
please weaken this this rhino weak in
this rhino
you are a a god amongst
amongst bats
big whoop
it's gonna be
it's gonna be interesting okay
i think we win
because we got yeah we just got numbers
no we draw okay fair enough i you you
had more hp than i didn't even look
because of the weakness i was like we're
just going to get you that's fine we
love it because we have scaling we don't
mind a draw
meow um garlic would probably work
nicely on something let's let's say on
our chicken for now
an extra life
on the on the rooster is kind of
interesting but it's going to come back
as a 1-1 so it's not that interesting
um i'm going to put melon armor on the
t-rex
we'll stay at the buff level
now the t-rex is like you know
you hope that they can live long enough
to get a kill
um this turtle is is horrible
still really bad
yeah yeah yeah okay at least we got rid
of your melon armor but
it's still really really bad at least
this will purge your melon armor
on on the unit that's behind you
and then we're gonna trade no we're not
gonna trade
but we are gonna
actually win thanks to our chickens is
mighty close but that is another seven
win marty in the books here you gotta
freeze this man
something having a steak it matters i
feel like our rhino is just getting
bodied by like status effects right now
i could be wrong for the record
roll me
roll me
freeze me
roll me
stall me
so we can actually get to a level three
rooster next turn and we don't have to
win this one or draw we have two we have
two lives to play with
for the love of god i just need to see
this this rhino do anything and that is
not how this is working out so far i
mean i don't see how we
win this fight
it's not happening
we were off by a lot this that you that
your squad deserves to do well you got a
very similar type build too not to
flatter myself unduly
we can't really buy anything
um and and keep our buffs going
but i mean the rhino has been so
i mean i'll just say it's been kind of
useless right
but all you got to do you know you go up
against the right squad everything falls
into place and maybe you're okay
like this could be big at the start here
if we weaken the front
that's big
it's not that big
hmm
you are a 43 oh no we're gonna make it
egg viewer
well hello
good game
in some ways
i'm i'm joking okay
now this rhino are we really going to
try to pivot to get an octopus to crack
it'll be in 1818 with no other buffs
attached to it
i guess you freeze it for now
and freeze it again
you might get lucky man like this is
worse than the rhino but the rhino
literally never had its ability pay off
anyway so i think that this had to be
done
and we're gonna need some luck okay
level three caterpillar means we got a
3434 coming up here
octopus does nothing of that we're aware
um
the weakness is is pretty nasty melon
armor is horrendous here
i feel like we still
oh no you peace
[Laughter]
we draw or sorry we lose is what i meant
a draw is a loss is a draw to me hey

an eight right that's pretty amazing for

hey everybody welcome back
super auto pets you know i i've been
playing a little
pay to win why don't you put me back on
the free to play for a bit i've been
playing a little bit this weekend too
i've been having a good time
um
you know when you play by the way first
off let me caffeinate
uh sip
secondly
i just want to say the community has
gotten good again
there was like when i started
i was around average level
then i had a
stream where i ascended the community
came up to meet me
then i kind of diminished then i had
like a little breakthrough over the past
maybe four or five days then this
weekend oh my god people are great again
but being on the free-to-play uh build
means you are destined
to run into a lot of horses
which is honestly fine okay
you can actually right you you want to
buy a horse first
that's a gimme
i definitely think we want a duck so
that we can sell it and make all of our
future animals better
you also get the buff on that you also
get the buff on this
and we want to keep the horse in the
middle because the horse is not doing
anything else so we want to make well
actually i think we want to keep the
horse at the front
even though they're probably going to
die we want to make sure the ant buffs
the
duck that seems sensible um
i think you can freeze another amp just
in case we should lose round one
let's be the upset astronauts there's
like there's almost an alliteration it
just sounds nice
i expect to lose round one
well we got it's a similar squad here so
we trade but then you buff
and then we trade and then you buff and
then we draw okay nothing wrong with
that the miffed legs what a name
what a name what a con thursday what a
concept
okay
now
you gotta you gotta think about this
okay i think this is a sell me
by me
because if we re-roll we lose the
benefit of the buy here
5-2 and
uh it to me it looks like this and we
want in imo we want the ants at the back
this is a maybe but probably a roll that
that annoys me but that's okay
um we got a full squad uh you know
technically the horses maybe should be
behind the cricket
so that they i mean obviously
[Laughter]
so that they get the buff on the one one
cricket that comes up but i'm also happy
my cricket will have a very good oh
frick
i still actually we we win don't we yeah
okay never mind i'm not saying we did it
perfectly but we did okay
those early wins they count just the
same as the late game wins so i'm i'm a
happy man there
um
i do think if we're gonna roll a a horse
build we want to combine our ants
throw in a spider
like so
we probably we have to think we probably
want to combine our horses but we are
getting double buffs out of them right
now
i mean i'm kinda and this might surprise
you
i think you roll like cool horse at the
back
the coolest horse is the horse with the
most stats
and then
like this
and then i think we just buy out for the
time being knowing
the cricket will probably last a little
bit the spiders are going to last longer
than anybody i think so let's let's go
like this
so you're actually i'm going to invest
in in making our current squad better um
in the hopes that like we're not going
to spend money on rerolls i like the
squad that we got going on here i like
our stats we'll try to get a level two
horse next turn which would go a long
way for us i see this is a little
dangerous okay a uh a five five
swan is tough to deal with
okay
you kill my spider which is not great
news
then you kill my giraffe you you create
a cool b but luckily we defeat the bee
this is a draw
this is a win
i'm stunned okay
our horse build beats their horse build
so far so good
two wins and we haven't even really
begun to peak yet which is kind of nice
let's make sure we're caffeinating
a duck doesn't interest me that much
right now it's i love it in the early
game
we're really fishing for something
what one thing you can do
is kill this ants
i'm okay with the buff believe it or not
then we gotta think
is this really the time to roll like a
peacock the answer is no i in my opinion
um
i think we can roll
i do like a dodo
i think we can afford to buy it it gets
a sick buff on this turn
and then i mean i think you freeze a
beehive roll me once
i i don't love anything that we got
going on here more or less
[Laughter]
unfortunately um
and then to be honest with you i think
we prefer like this
let's see
uh i don't want to roll two horses any
longer i want to i want to pivot out of
our
horse build into like stronger units so
maybe we should have actually
prioritized um
maybe we should have prioritized like
the peacock but i don't know i'm okay
with it for now
you know we we do okay here you're
giving mel and armor that's a given we
create a b the b's gonna trade with the
flamingo the ant's gonna get uh one shot
despite the stat upgrade we're gonna get
a
four two we're gonna we're gonna
actually win again
somehow we we bought ourselves a lot of
space with with these dubs early on here
so i'm not disappointed in that
but we gotta we gotta figure out what
the heck we're doing here you can
definitely it sucks to lose the double
buff okay but we need to start doing
something
um
you can definitely roll
like this and then an ox
i feel like behind the spider
i don't really love a garlic yet why
don't you give me a roll i'll take
another spider for now
and a sheep is is an amazing hit here
right like
i actually feel like you probably sell
the dodo
it's it no longer has its cool buff
and then you run sheep
in front of the ox instead
me i don't think you need to freeze a
pill just roll me
a dog is kind of like it's an important
part of this build i actually think it's
a little late to try to get the dog
build to run i think instead we're
trying to get to like level five and six
units maybe that can define our run
quickly because our spam build is gonna
run out of utility pretty soon
that's nasty
it's known nastiness your melon armor
was was perfect oh or was it perfectly
executed because now we're gonna get you
which is fine
we we do want a level two horse for the
time being though there's a little melon
armor for me and a little buff excuse me
where's where's my my buff and melon
armor
we ain't sweating it i i'm stunned kind
of that we're out here what is this like
four wins
four wins zero losses
i i feel like this build is not that
good and i'm not just trying to flex
but here we are okay so this is big i
think
you definitely want the spider to level
up to see what you get i'm not thrilled
with what we got
but that's okay i think you can sell
the cricket
to start running a whale
the problem is you got to figure out
where to place this son of a gun
i think
cause like okay well we know we're
selling you
then like a whale eating a spider is not
so bad
because it gets a nice buff here the
only problem is that it will lose the
meat which is a pretty big element of
this right now
or
we could try running something like this
and the downside of it
is that
we're only gonna summon one ram but no
matter as long as we have five units no
matter where we put you you're always
gonna only summon one ram on the whale
swallow
so i'm not thrilled
i think this is this is a thinker if you
will
freeze one cupcake just in case roll me
once i think this is a snail freeze
situation and honestly why don't you go
ahead and
buy me this uh cupcake because again i
think i misrepresent or i misunderstood
the cupcake for a long time i was like
why would i pay for temporary stats well
because winning is permanent how about
that
so i'm not scared of too much here
i don't mind this that the math on that
is unfortunate
that blowfish is going to be a little
spooky however
we have exact oh
no
because you're going to hit several
times
[Laughter]
not the horse
i can live with that you were going to
die anyway what are you thinking like
there's no way you're going to pull
through this 11 8 i think
except for when you do
and then we draw
that's amazing to me but it's also a
great indicator that we're getting past
the point where like the scaling is
working for us we got to start
rethinking how this is going to go down
so a uh a rooster is an amazing unit if
we can level it up and get it buffed
are we willing to get i mean the ox did
a lot of work but this is the thing do
you want to get sunk in the quicksand
because this is how you get sunk in the
quicksand what what do i mean by this
statement well
um
if we stick with this build we're going
to hit diminishing returns really soon
so i think that we're getting to the
point where we can start to try to build
something better
i think we're probably going to suffer
some losses temporarily so if you'll
excuse me for a second here i think
we're gonna sell our horse and start
pivoting this whole freaking build we're
gonna buy a rooster
we're gonna buff the rooster
we don't need to well honestly i'm like
maybe we maybe it's not the worst thing
in the world to freeze two snails the
rooster is getting buffed
because the buff no not gonna happen the
buff benefits us but is also
the most likely
that's probably better right
yeah that seems better your stats will
still be seven seven i think um
the it it's the most likely to benefit
us long term and its stats also give us
a bonus in the in the time that it's
being used in the first place okay so we
got a very similar build here but you
got great scaling from the monkeys your
kangaroo scares the crap out of me i
would describe myself as uh
as moderately frightened for certain i
think that kangaroo is gonna is gonna
pop off man excuse me why do i have a 3
3 chick there instead
yeah this seems this seems bad
i see your spam here and i respect it i
would like to steal it for myself okay
there's no way we're punching through
this kangaroo just embrace it even if we
do which we can't we're not gonna get
through the monkeys
you know what we're actually gonna draw
i we
our team was so much worse but the ox
having just exactly the right stats what
a world we live in
um
okay i mean i do think you can even
though it doesn't specifically help us
right now i still think you keep one
snail around just in case i recognize
the problems with this i genuinely do so
we actually don't like this anymore this
is no longer it doesn't appeal to me so
i guess we'll just have you eat the
sheep
maybe roll that instead and uh
just thinking
just i'm i'm thinking um
spy no you know i'd i would rather not
buy salad
i would
i'm gonna buy salad please hit my
chicken
you're a piece our ox might stick around
that's what i was worried about like the
chicken is the only unit i really care
about here
it's the light of my life this is and i
know i said this before and been wrong
this definitely looks like a loss
all of these units have good stats
that's unfortunate for me
but
oh no the rhino the rhino has a combo
and then it smacks me
and then it smacks me
and then it smacks me
and then it smacks me
[Laughter]
and then
it smacks me
and then i get a buff but it's not
enough that dude andrew dinkum what a
squad that's that's a nasty squad there
with the sun hat deals us our first loss
i'm content to say that that's long
overdue honestly
the the parrot can be very interesting
what do we not want on this squad
honestly the whale is getting pretty
close to being actually the sheep is
largely useless
selmy
are we going to roll a parrot
copy's the level one so on on death
you could summon another parrot or you
could get the effect of the ox benefit
or you could summon a little creature
i'm not sold on the parrot okay what i
am sold on is is a cow is nice
and we already know that the cow is
gonna feed the chicken
then we're gonna free no
end turn give the friend ahead plus one
plus one
and turn is like the scaling in battle
or outside of battle here
i feel like
what
um
i feel like one of the big parts of our
um ability to succeed here
is honestly
getting like a level two chicken
a rhino is very interesting as well
don't get me wrong
anthony you definitely want a snail out
here
just because of the the buff it gives is
out of control
and i guess you know people are gonna
look at this and be like what's wrong
with you
i think we gotta
we gotta get some benefit out of this
[Laughter]
this our spider is not good
like when it i look just send it this i
i predict a loss okay but i think our
chicken allows us to start dreaming of
future wins
at least it's only a level one turtle
this is a nasty squad kangaroos nasty
nasty squad man
six four
we beat you that's fine your melon armor
i i understand the way that this is
gonna go
this is why we really want to see oh you
peace
this is why we really want to see a
level two chicken
oh no it's my white weenie build i think
we win this honestly or we come very
close
um because like our chicken is just
really strong
and if as long as we kill you even if
you kill me we're making it yeah all
right well this actually went really
well
but imagine if we had two
level or 22-1 chicks that came out
afterwards
okay well we don't care about uh a snail
leveling up a hippo that gets cracked
can get a little nasty so let's start
here
leopard is an interesting one too
hippo has that it has that scaling
potential though one thing's for sure we
don't care about our whale in the
slightest
so i do think that maybe
we're on round 10 i'm a little scared of
the hippo being a little late to the
party
um
i you know what i feel like we can roll
a leopard here
makes a nice sound when it comes out too
and then the chili pepper can be can be
pretty good
we'd rather have like melon armor on you
though i think um
we unfreeze that that's my bad we're not
gonna invest in our spider
the rhino also it appeals to me
mightily
i think we can freeze the rhino for the
future we're looking to level up the
leopard for sure and the leopard also
benefits from a buff here so oh by the
way probably should get rid of our snail
at some point my mistake
probably probably a little bit more
valuable uh to keep a whale than a snail
but
alas
what's done is done i see what you're
doing here but i kind of oh you have a
level two chicken okay
is this this interesting
that's an interesting thing we got there
i still feel okay
it's a nice hit we knew this was coming
the melon armors is a piece for sure but
dude this ox is going to be a he's going
to be a force to be reckoned with
we're going to summon our own yeah two
chicks you're done
this is the rooster is doing some
serious work this is six wins
on a build that i was not feeling great
about to be honest
do we roll a rhino
in front
in the hopes that it can just
it really screws up a white weeny build
we can sell the snail
we can roll a rhino it it basically has
to be in front we're keeping this frozen
because it's like the most valuable
piece of the puzzle tiger is disgusting
um
there's like there's no wrong answer
[Laughter]
i feel like you can sell your spider and
then roll a tiger behind a rooster at
like the very back
in which case
when the rooster dies it will summon
four chicks
with the same
attack i think
so the spider was not gonna be part of
the squad much longer anyway
why don't you give me a tiger at the
very back chicken right here the ox now
has no purpose just to be honest with
you
so i think maybe the benefit there is
you sell the ox
buy a leopard
roll me knowing that this gets us there
next time
i wish that this was not honey but you
know
um
we should spend our money if we're gonna
do something we should spend our money
so we might as well get you closer to
leveling up i guess again this is not
ideal but this is our our necessary
pivot from from like surprising early
and mid-game superstar to hopefully like
having the potential to go wild this is
a loss if you run into turkey fly you
just give up basically unless the rhino
can go freaking wild which it will not
obviously
this yeah this is a disaster especially
considering it's a level two turkey
[Laughter]
the only thing i'm hoping for is maybe
the the four roosters oh my god i was so
wrong i apologize we actually easily won
and uh i now sound like i was
sandbagging the whole time
wasn't my intention
so this is a combine
we didn't have space in the shop which
was my bad we should have set that up
freeze me
buy me
buff me buff me this i'm okay i know
that the chicken gets the benefit too
because the leopard is is quite nice
also the leopard works well with the
tiger but i'm not gonna mix it up too
much right now we're gonna we're just
gonna buy you
maybe i guess we don't sell you yet
we're looking for something
a snake is kind of disgusting
um especially if you can get a snake
behind something that lives for a while
like
that's kind of insane
uh
so like behind the rooster perhaps but i
i don't know i like what we got here
i think
look i for the time being i do think you
sell cow
you might as well buy snake
and put it behind leopard and hope for
the best
roll me once give me another leopard
a steak on our rooster or sorry on our
hippo um is also great maybe melon armor
on our rooster in the future then
we're at seven wins one loss
i'm starting to believe we can get there
but i'm i'm holding my breath a little
bit this is horrible obviously
it's disastrous
that's even worse
[Laughter]
and i i like your snake build here great
minds think alike
good good shot one good turn deserves
another i suppose
now we only summoned two chicks
unfortunately if we'd summoned three by
or four by having a tiger we actually
would have won but our our tiger getting
iced by the uh
the dolphin was it i mean that was just
a it was a move of pure genius what can
you say
try
it try it
i still believe in this i i understand
what killed us last time this is where
you just go like oh what are the odds of
the exact same thing happens again
hopefully somewhat low and then roll it
because this is where it could all come
crashing down
seven wins one loss is great seven wins
three losses little less so
uh so we do four damage to you until
unless maybe we got so lucky we busted
your melon armor open
that that throws a monkey wrench into
your whole plan i'm sure
because this is a huge play mel and
armor just going wild man okay not bad
not bad and then we got you know 12
roosters at the back just in case
i still feel like the snake can pop
now turtle
is very interesting
i don't think it's the squad we want but
it's an interesting idea
we're kind of just fishing for what
we're looking for here
i mean honestly
i think you just buy a one-up for the
the tiger
then if oh maybe
maybe
sure yeah yeah this is fine then if it
gets sniped again at least it comes back
because we don't care about his stats
it's all about its ability so we we beat
dolphin now i think
it's a nasty squad of course
you don't really care
to get a scorpion um
hurt but not killed but look at this
you peace
doesn't matter
we brought back the tiger the splash
damage won it okay look at that or that
didn't win it i should say
um
so we're at nine wins
kind of crazy right
take a little buff on me please
take a little buff on me
freeze me
roll me
take a little buff on me
i think there there's a chance nine wins
is good
it's great i don't want to set the
expectations badly
i see your fly build and it's it scares
me it does
um
i also feel like our snake
does pretty well versus a fly build
it at least landed two extra shots then
you're gonna do some the splash damage
is really bad
what the
like the splash damage is is really bad
for my uh
for my overall builds here but that's
why you keep
the tiger around
now we get four 24 twos
you're gonna get buffed to high heaven
i i don't think we win though
i think we lose
but it was so close
we that was a fight for the ages right
there i want to say by the way
just to be able to compete
with the turkey uh fly build is
exceptional
that is a huge surprise in and of itself
um
so believe it or not i know you're gonna
be like come on man
but believe it or not you actually have
no real reason
uh to
level up the rooster
it gets stats but we can't summon
six chicks we could summon three
and then have our tiger
make the snake
do better
you know
you know i this is probably like if it
ain't broke don't fix it
but i think
i think you got a point
this would only summon two at the back
but you would
hit every time you attacked you would
hit for 10 twice i'm not i'm not willing
to do it what i am willing to do is get
you to the next level regardless i think
that's important
and then basically freeze and just we're
rolling for something that looks like
the dream
um
because this is it all comes down to
this i think probably the dream as much
as it might surprise you is just maybe
like melon armor on snake
if it lands one more attack maybe we
turn a loss into a draw
okay very similar squad here level two
dodo is very spicy you got a similar
sort of chicken set up here
i understand you got a five five bus
melon armor has helped me out a little
bit
that's that it purges some melon armor
can't be mad
that's it it did half damage can't be
mad
that sucks
[Laughter]
there we go we're still alive okay i
know you're you're summoning a bunch of
uh
pieces of garbage it is what it is
you peace so we lose this
we it's a nine win marty but you know
what
that's not so bad in the whole scheme of
things that's not so bad
i'm just we faded a little bit at the
end but i mean when you run into turkeys
what do you expect
thanksgiving happy thanksgiving
everybody um in canada at least for now
thanks for watching hope you've enjoyed
it if you did click like button also
great deal of course subscribe you want
to see more in the future for now thanks
for watching i'll see you next time see
ya



hey everybody welcome back you can't be
mad about a nine piece win we're gonna
run free to play again because i
accidentally started uh the game without
changing to the pay to win deck
it happens we don't we don't care for a
cricket this is a this is a roll me
please hit my fish
you peace
still i mean
don't combine them that would be
disastrous this is still like a three
four fish is dangerous to to deal with
early on here will be the gasping mouths
i mean it just makes perfect sense right
the wavy rangers an ant always scares
the crap out of me
don't buff yeah okay by not buffing the
cricket i think we've turned this into a
draw
if the but well we might have still
drawn early draws are pretty common like
you know everybody kind of knows i think
what they're looking for early on here
a duck benefits us in the future an ant
really like an ant wins matches early
um
so i think
the way to play this
is you freeze i know it looks goofy
because the otter is not an incredible
choice but it gives us
the ability
to easily yeah and the answer yeah okay
you know what i respect this it gives us
the ability to easily um get to a tier
three unit early and that can win you
like two rounds by itself
very great minds think alike i've
noticed uh
sorry our first two units traded with
their first two units this will be we
please hit the fish okay thanks for your
help you're gonna hit the fish
you're gonna be i think this is a draw
then
if we were at 50 50 away from that being
a win and we're rolling like an otter
squad right now so i'm not i'm not too
upset
so we start here
dude an ox is kind of sick um
i'm just like if i go bump bump
yeah let's do it
what uh freeze me
keep me
i like this
not so much that will probably freeze
you as well we're gonna freeze you
you're gonna work super well with an ox
i don't think we want like a double ox
build or whatever but
yeah this is okay
i don't i don't love the way this is set
up we probably should have sold the duck
instead of uh re-rolling twice yeah okay
brain's not where it needs to be here
well the fishy fingers in keeping with
their name this is a beautiful otter for
us that just did some incredible work
and now we we punch through you with
melon armor which is lovely
we definitely win this one in spite of
my my disrespect towards the duck
a 7 6 fish at the back is hard to crack
early late late game it's kind of a joke
but um
so i would say
this is a sell me
by me
combine me
spider
up at the front is gonna benefit this
aux the most
roll me
i think that this is a
pill me and hope it hits the ox
this is a pretty spicy spider up at the
front man and then i think you roll a
dodo and we're looking to buff that dodo
in the future unfreeze this pill the the
fish is next to go
this is a squad that can win us some
rounds
just via the ox
4 8 is nasty obviously but
we do pretty much i mean we literally
trade with you which is good because we
actually have a spider that comes out
afterwards it gives us an ox buff so
it's better than a trade
i'm not worried about this one this one
looks pretty good
actually it's going to be a draw
but that's okay unless you had a b thank
god no b that's okay i i like this i
like where we're at
we sell
being honest
i love this play
you want an ox buff you want a dodo buff
for obvious reasons if it's not oh and
he starts with melon armor
[Laughter]
forever now or just for this one time
probably just for this one time but it's
that's funny either way
but dude i i mean i gotta like level
with you or whatever an early deer is
kind of disgusting
the dodo is also very nice um
i mean i think you still roll the deer
up at the front we only i looking at
this build right now i'm like we only
lose to like chili pepper
and i don't think you're gonna see too
many of those on like game four or
whatever we're on this is gonna destroy
your your ants which is nice for me
and then it's gonna destroy
your flaming oh no it's gonna destroy
your your rabbit and your beat that's
okay
little buff no sweat
this is
i don't know what to say man this is
great
this ox can be with us for a while the
next thing to leave will be the beaver
it's like he knew so you we had killing
the flamingo in front of you actually
did give you like permanent melon armor
that's kind of crazy
like that's that's incredible
level two dodo is pretty sick i don't
see anything here i love
something i might love is you know this
is a we get a double benefit out of that
and to be honest with you
it's a little bit of a it's a a bit
cheesy right to just invest in these
wins but
three gold is kind of an awkward number
you kind of got to make a choice right
away
now this looks bad they they have i
wouldn't i don't know if i call it a
meta squad or whatever but
you know we got a pretty
similar setup only i think that theirs
is
probably a little bit smarter
but we do have a 22 8 ox
that's gonna live through the bus
it's not gonna live through the peacock
but we're gonna draw
that's pretty okay all things considered
we're only at two wins but this is this
is a squad that can go deeper
don't get tricked
i don't think this is a peacock build
i think you can roll i think honestly if
we're keeping this for a minute you can
take one of those
now kangaroo
actually is a perfect addition behind
our insanely tanky ox
now it screws up the dodo
frees me for a sec
freeze me for a sec
the freeze for me at this point is like
basically
i don't want to think about it
[Laughter]
so it does screw up our dodo but our
dodo is one dodo or one chocolate bar
away from
being able to hit that ox as well
i like that we got a weird
deck going on here man they have a level
three horse which means i mean the best
time to fight this squad as well that
bison is still only a 1010 thankfully
that badger is gonna be it's gonna be
something let's put it that way
it's really gonna hurt their whale but
it did kill my bus
they create a spider it's a 5 2 spider
spider has been killed
comes a 5 2 snail
it's fine we create a camel that does
nothing if we're being honest but this
is where it really shines dude that
bison is here so early though that's
going to be that's going to be very bad
for teams that play daha 8901 later
but our squad is is kind of cruising huh
i still don't like
not buying a can is like
let me put it this way it's nobody's
favorite play
but i think we're doing
a sensible thing
by looking for the exact stuff that we
want in the future and really like one
dodo is is the biggest force multiplier
we can ask for right now
two four i see a level one turtle and i
i get the danger i'm not that perturbed
but that rhino what the backs got me
it's got me tripping up a little bit
okay as long as oh you're so freaking
lucky the bus
doesn't kill you
but then it's gonna
okay
i mean you're gonna kill my spider
oh you're a you're a very shrewd
individual aren't you
aren't you
hold on though that's fine we don't
really care for the two two this this is
where things get interesting
melon armor is is top tier obviously
your rhino uh being killed before it can
kill us is insanely important and then
our kangaroo beats your dodo and we're
off to the races we built our own little
strange squad that's doing great work
so the monkey is is very very very nice
for scaling
but what do you want to scale
our spot even though our spider's eight
six it doesn't have to be here anymore
the thing is though like if you're gonna
roll a monkey you kind of need to dump a
deer
because where are you gonna put this
deer in the rotation right
so we we can't put an ox at the front we
need we need a frontline unit and i
don't think it's a rooster
this is a weird transition period but i
i believe it okay
i believe that
is going to be a touch goofy for a bit
here
if we buff the spider we buff the spider
that oh
mama
let me think
so we have a good thing going um
but a turkey is like
i think a turkey is worth the pivot
straight up so i think i hate to say it
goodbye kangaroo
i don't expect
that's a must get
probably this matters
probably that matters
i don't expect necessarily to to crush
on this
wave i we might have a couple of turns
of getting ourselves set up uh for for
future prospects but
don't hit the melon armor you are you
peace
oh no
oh it's okay hold on you get the melon
armor back let's go
let's go
[Laughter]
the the turkey and shark combo is gonna
okay you've taken my melon armor again
but guess what i got some more melon
armor
you're i mean a level three horse is
pretty dangerous but at least we were
punching through man this is no sweat
the the turkey horse or sorry turkey uh
shark fly combination like it's it's
worth the pivot especially if we're
winning while we're pivoting
um
so i think you still
still start
maybe with this
uh
the ox has done great work for us i
think it's time for the dodo to say
goodbye
you're going to go here we still want to
roll a spider obviously we're going to
want one more turkey the thing that we
could do
is uh
i mean maybe the monkey's not too long
for this world anymore but i think we'll
just put you up here for now
a dog is a little late in my opinion um
a deer though can be pretty amazing i
guess now because we're gonna dump the
spider even though the spider fits us
we're gonna dump the monkey we're gonna
dump the ox we just have to think about
what we're bringing out instead a horse
i think it's too late for the i mean the
shark is basically just a better dog and
the turkey's just a better horse so
again we're still in this transition
period but i'm i'm definitely a believer
in in how this could work for us like
that's an amazing start okay
then we do lose melon armor but then
guess what we gain melon armor
and you're getting buffed you're getting
buffed you're getting buffed we purge
your melon armor we're getting buffed
you don't have melon armor you're
getting buffed you're dead
you're dead you're gonna kill our monkey
though which is that's nasty this is a
loss actually
never mind i'm totally wrong we won and
now i apologize for my actions
nothing wrong with that
hold on i just had to text my parents
there they said should we dress up for
thanksgiving
it's not that kind of party mom don't
worry about it okay i mean this is what
i'm wearing at thanksgiving so um so the
monkey's gotta go it it's been doing
good work and the spiders gotta go the
monkey is don't get me wrong the scaling
is incredible we got to lean into the
build okay
the spider gets sold replaced with the
deer
the deer gets an awesome buff to start
with but is also going to give tons of
buffs to our ox so it's like just a
better situation there
um
you totally could
roll the chicken out here in place of
that monkey for now
and then think about where we take it in
the future i mean to be honest i do kind
of want to sell the ox
but as long as the ox is still pumping
i'm like maybe
maybe it's not necessary you know i
think some garlic on our shark will do
wonders for us a pear is pretty good too
but
so we're at six wings no losses
i love seeing an 86 right off the bat
we like it you get a a heck of a buff
here you get a buff you get a buff
everybody gets a buff that's fine
that's free locate level two oh don't
shoot okay that's fine uh level level
two turtle is is deadly for sure that's
very dangerous but i still think we're
we're getting ya i don't see how we
wouldn't be getting you here
that doesn't really help too much but
maybe it does actually i don't know too
well we still make it
i mean this has the potential to be a
perfect build
i'm not saying
that it's a hundred percent locked in
but it's it's really quite nice
[Laughter]
i think you roll
and you're really looking for the things
you already got right
so the shark i i think the turkey is a
little bit more valuable than the shark
but
i could be wrong about that
um
if we get flies definitely i think we'll
prefer that
and if we only have three gold left
let's just uh
probably throw in like a a cupcake maybe
on the ox let's see if it can live a
little longer it's it's turned 12.
i think we got a pretty strong squad for
turn 12.
maybe not that strong
that's pretty nasty but i will say i
feel like
if we punch through oh that snake's
gonna do us like that's gonna be
terrible man um i feel like if we're if
we're able to punch through the peacock
the rest of the squad could fall apart
we get a kill thankfully
the turkey dying is pretty bad but the
shark
i don't think it's gonna do it
[Laughter]
but it might
oh my god i think it's just gonna get to
a draw
i'll take it man that's that's uh that's
lucky for me i think
maintain that semi-perfect record
again like i don't know if the ox is the
right play right now but it it is
getting heavily buffed it's hard to say
no to that
steak on the deer i think works nice and
we might as well buy a salad at that
point onwards rather than just investing
in rerolls that might not work so the
next thing we want and and
we'd either we'd probably sell the
rooster for this
because our ox is pretty sick this is
another
pretty nasty squad here
obviously at least
at least there's no uh snake sniping our
back line here
and you know what that peacock's going
down man this ox is
he's proven his weight
worth his weight in gold here
this is nasty our our
shark oh my god is
not gonna live which means we're gonna
lose but barely there goes the perfect
but but life goes on
i'm still a believer
very much so
i
i mean i hate to
maybe i don't hate to you know what
maybe i don't hate to and then we freeze
and then we sell
and then we fly
might as well put you there
a 1010 fly huh and then we roll
and then we chill
you may want shark at the very back
instead of the middle oh my god a 42-45
don't kill my turkey
oh oh please please no it's just a
splash for five it's not a splat
you don't kill my turkey you okay the
fly still lives
there is another a two-two fly comes out
that then gets
buffed to it oh you piece
oh that's i mean this is like the
perfect counter build to what we got
going on unfortunately
now our ox is going to die on the hit
which is really bad
then the shark is going to kill you
you peace
this one was close i i'm not mad like
we're in there
little reworking the order slightly and
hopefully like not getting sniped on our
back line
i think that's a little bit better
even though it it admittedly looks a
little goofy in and of itself
and i think we're pretty i mean maybe we
put a steak on you roll you once and
then we're like we know that the squad's
looking pretty nasty but
i the ox probably still benefits the
most from the buff in my opinion
i think maybe we just have like one i'm
i have so way too much commitment to
this ox
when i also i see that you have a double
dodo here oh no
[Laughter]
maybe a little bit too much commitment
to this ox
maybe more than a little too much coming
into the ox
yes okay
fair enough nice buff
yeah go ahead purge my melon armor right
we would die anyway like because the 50
would destroy us but
okay at least at least
we still get to attack with our turkey
which has a stake attached to it
i mean this is uh
this could be
it could be a win it is a it is a draw
by one hp
i'm still a believer okay
i don't necessarily believe in the melon
armor now
maybe we freeze one on the fly just so
it's
slightly less likely to get
well we might as well roll here because
everyone else is kind of tapped on
the advantages
this is a big freeze
roll me
i just want to see a turkey please wait
i guess we could freeze a deer i don't
know we're kind of we're we're only at
seven wins
i thought we were doing better than that
we're kind of hitting a wall here
what if we sold the ox and created like
a similar enabler you know
i think we have the same squad but
stronger here
um
levels are pretty similar
roster is pretty similar but i feel like
that cricket and the ram
i understand them but i feel like it's a
bit of a weak point as compared to our
fly
obviously this is going to get buffed to
the extreme
we do well there
thank you melon armor we do well here
we don't do so well here
this is where it starts to it starts to
fall apart
uh yeah actually i've increasingly come
to the realization i think we're gonna
lose here that's a big hit though but
then you summon two four four rams out
of that holy crap man
i'm i'm coming to the realization
we have to kill
our own ox
and i i gained no pleasure in that
holy crap
i thought we had oh you had melon
i think we have to kill our own ox and
replace it with something better
i don't know what for the record
that means we wouldn't invest in a deer
here
our sharks scaling faster is probably
worth enough so like let's at least
start there
if i sell you you're gonna sell for a
bunch
like a chicken creates some bonuses
afterwards i i i you're going to think
i've lost my mind
i genuinely think i sell you for a sheep
i do and i i understand the
it's probably not going to be the most
popular decision i've ever made
i'm hoping we don't run into fly turkey
builds please it's just an incredibly
strong dodo melon armor build
okay at least we're killing the penguin
then our turkey is oh we don't even have
a turkey yet i understand the summons
are a little goofy here this is all in
service of our shark getting stronger
later that was just a very uneconomical
situation for everybody involved
um at least we're purging your melon
armor
i think we're toasted man
we ran up again i'm never going to be
mad about a seven
four but still
i fee maybe we shouldn't have pivoted
maybe we should have kept our trust in
the ox and not built around turkey and
fly but you know i saw my moment i went
for it it is what it is for now thanks
for watching hope you guys have enjoyed
the episode if you did click the like
button thanks for watching i'll see you
next time see ya



hello in record time
we must do
a super auto pets tier list this is only
the free to play units oh wait every
unit in base pack and pack one
really because i don't see a bat
am i crazy where where's my bad
that that's my indicator
it's position oh there it is right there
literally at the top
[Laughter]
so we're gonna rank every unit okay
we're gonna do it
s a b c d big ups to
mcd 644 for making a list here picture
of an uh super pet right there
themselves would you look at that uh
it's in alphabetical order okay
just imagine
this is squeeze me this is juice me
tease me freeze me
reprieve me i don't want to see you
anymore okay let's get started ant tier
one unit two one gives another unit two
one when it dies
i would be inclined to say if if you see
an ant in your first shop
that's a that's a juice me
you take it as a gimme the ant will win
you early rounds
without a doubt
and it has a synergy late where you can
pill it in order to buy me kill me
exactly i see people in chat saying buy
me kill me fish if you get one fish and
one ant in your first shop plus one roll
you you win draws and you get free wins
it's a dream come true i love it give me
uh or you i guess you could take ant
beetle as well that would be fine i love
it okay a tier maybe not quite s but
eight here
uh hatching chick this is a tough one
okay
level one gives plus five plus five
temporarily to the unit in front of it
level two gives plus two plus two
permanently level three
gives you experience on the unit in
front of it so if you can level it up
it's great it's also uh i mean like i
might even be asked here
five five early is insane like one of
the ways that i've managed to make this
work okay listen it's a tier three unit
okay let's just place it here for now
it's a tier three unit
uh so you can buy it
by the time you buy it maybe you've got
like a seven seven fish or something
like that a seven seven beetle uh a
seven seven pig maybe
now you've got a 12 12 if you put some
garlic armor on it you're you're
multiple times
this basically just enables your your
tankiest unit to wipe the entire enemy
squad by yourself is very useful i would
stop short of putting it in the s tier
because it's weird
the plus five plus five is amazing it's
like s tier useful
the plus two plus two is only okay i
actually think it gets temporarily less
useful but it's a necessary step but if
you can get it to level three early
then like this could be s tier again so
i'm gonna balance it out in the eighth
here okay
badger
i'm going to put them down in the seats
here i mean no disrespect i think it
starts as a 5-4 when it dies it deals
its attack damage to all remaining
uh to adjacent enemies so you put this
on or adjacent animals you put this on
your back line when it dies it'll
probably kill their
their unit if they still have a unit
so it it draws
losses
doesn't really win you draws but it's
it's interest i think it's situational
the way that i play this sometimes is
like
on turn three
you develop a unit so that you get to
tier three units if it's a badger i'm
like i'll take it five four stats are
uh are are pretty good early and then i
sell it from that point onwards if it
gets sniped that's disastrous
okay i think this is fair badger with b
wins you draws
uh
i mean technically true but are we
evaluating it based on uh if you add
another
three gold onto it because i mean if
we're talking about that then there's a
lot of these units that would change my
evaluation of
i also like
this is not just based on what i like to
run it's also based on like what i've
played against
and let me tell you when i see a badger
on the enemy team the first thing i
think to myself is like
this is at worst to draw most of the
time it's a win
when i when i run into a badger i'm not
saying i've never lost but i've uh
i mean it's not deed here but i've
definitely crushed
most badger teams versus like if i see
an early peacock or an early kangaroo on
the enemy team i'm like okay let's
cancel christmas
now bat it's not even close bat is
actually like uh in my opinion i'm not
an esports guy but i'm gonna pretend to
sound like one bat is a meta defining
unit it's so
uh
omnipotent well um i'm the present i
don't like how the word comes out of my
mouth but
uh weak is
you will see this every
second round if you play free to play
like it almost needs its own tear it's
it's crazy
weakness
uh
is not just great
like let's go over weakness okay
it
causes every attack that hits that enemy
to do five extra damage
which is bs that's crazy it also purges
whatever equipment they had on them
before and equipment was like insanely
uh important for so many different units
sorry it's not even free to play i mean
pay to win sorry sorry
it's it's totally oppressive i think if
you're gonna make it that
i i think weak needs to be nerfed
in the sense that i think it should only
block
or it should only make
the first attack do extra damage
it making every attack do extra damage
is insane
maybe you nerf the bat somehow instead
like maybe at level one a bat doesn't do
much extra
like like it can transform or something
like level two it has weakness level
three it has two weakness because three
is crazy but
um or maybe it pops on faint or
something like that that's interesting
but it's too good for now i think
they're always gonna have it run
overrun equipment but uh
or do you move it up a tier maybe or
something like that so it's much harder
to get a level three but it's the the
bad is so good like it's crazy talk
um so i the beaver you got to evaluate
it within the context of
the situation that it's in right uh this
is this is a tier one i think a beaver
is like a perfect
b-tier
tier one animal
the way that you do it you you don't
really rely on it
you you buy it for one round
and then you sell it to buff the units
that are gonna stick around like the
strategy that i have i'll try to buy
either a fish or a beetle
in the first couple of rounds literally
in the first round if i buy a beaver to
augment it that's great because in round
two i sell the beaver
it
buffs the fish in all likelihood as long
as you do your order right and all of a
sudden you know you've got like uh
you got like a three five fish that
maybe gets buffed even beyond that i
think it's pretty good i i think i think
given that you own the thing is you only
care about it be when it shows up in the
first round or the second round but i i
respect it in the b tier for
sure beetle
is is a tough one okay i'm gonna i'm
gonna put beetle at the high beat here
beetle is insane early
but its actual effect is garbage it's
terrible
i know you never roll food builds nl
like this is
uh something you shouldn't do but like
it's
it's the stats are awesome the two three
wins you rounds early it doesn't scale
at all so i think a b tier
knowing that you get rid of it after
that is pretty good okay now we're gonna
start making some enemies i think pretty
soon
uh the bison
i always get it confused this is maybe
this is an ox i can't remember no i know
it's or the
buffalo but anyway
it's really good
when you get its effect to work okay the
way that its effect works is that you
need to have at least a tier three then
it gets plus two plus two every turn
otherwise it's just a six six that does
nothing so if you can get this early
genuinely
you could maybe have it in the sa tier
i really rarely end up taking it because
by the time i get like a
a bison it's very rare for me to have a
uh a tier three unit or even be close
sometimes i'll have a tier two and be
three away but still
um
so i'd actually put it down here in the
seat here but i still put it over badger
honestly
now i gotta tell you blowfish
i used to think it was ester i used to
think it was the strongest
uh unit in the game
i've come down on it a little bit
i would rather have
a peacock i would rather have a kangaroo
i'd rather have a couple of things you
know going on here
but the blowfish i think is still pretty
good
you can it it at least not everything
that you buy is something that you have
to level up forever sometimes you just
buy things temporarily to help you win
some rounds so there's situations where
like maybe
you a blowfish shows up in your shop you
buy the blowfish you know you get a
turtle or something like that and then
all of a sudden you're like i got a
tanky unit it's got melon armor it gets
a couple of ability procs and then it's
like good to go
but overall this is like a maybe buy for
me sometimes
now
i know that people are going to be like
you're you're stacking up one tier in
particular here
um
bluebird
is also around here in the beats here
like
scaling is nice don't get me wrong
i think scaling is is
valuable
um
but i would rather have like a fish or
something like that
early on for sure because at one hp this
thing not only does it not live but it
only trades with like half of the tier
one animals so i i think that it could
be good um
and i do run it sometimes most of the
time i find i would rather just spend
three hp on another copy of an existing
good unit that will buff it by one one
instead of relying on this guy because
he basically exists just to get killed
um
but that's okay it's situational but
decent okay sometimes uh what the heck
does the does the buffalo do
every time you buy a friend he gets plus
one plus one right
so it's like it's a strictly superior
dog
um
look
i'm going to put a smack dab in the
middle of the beats here
i think that again it a lot of these
depend on situations right it can scale
like crazy if it shows up early
otherwise like if you get it in the late
game you're like okay it's a six six or
a seven seven or a four six maybe now
that i think about it like
it's not great but at the same time
you're also like uh i guess if a beetle
shows up in the late game you also don't
really care
[Laughter]
to be honest but um i i find it's okay
but i would rather build around a hippo
in the same tier than build around the
the buffalo
now camel
i've only started doing it recently but
i actually think camel is an a tier
unit
so if you're not familiar with the camel
i would even i might even put it there
for now
camel
when it gets hurt gives the unit behind
it plus two plus one or
plus four plus two or plus six plus
three depending on its uh
uh on its tier level
as long as you get something
behind it that benefits from that
it's crazy i mean again you the camel's
tier three right you can have a camel in
front of even like your your great tier
one unit all of a sudden you know
there's multiple i've been taking a
camel like every time it shows up lately
you can have like a 15 15 fish
once they finally punch through your
camel and you know then they just lose
like nothing else can happen
um it does super well with the kangaroo
does super well with a peacock does well
with the blowfish any anything behind it
that gets a benefit when it gets hurt
gets better because of the fact that uh
you know
gaining that extra hp is worth a lot
this is really good like that i love the
camel
uh
caterpillar
i i would honestly
you this might surprise you i would
actually put it in the eights here it is
hard to rank
i think people might have thought i was
shooting for like a lower tier here but
if you get a caterpillar within like the
first couple of rounds that the tier
threes are available i think you
basically take it
no matter what because it you just rely
on getting another
great unit and it copies it
you can't put equipment on it which
sucks you kind of need like a turtle to
enable it
i think it's good man like honestly i
respect it there's one thing that sucks
about it it gets bodied hard by like
leopard and dolphin depending on where
you put it
um
like when you
it sucks when it transforms into like
whatever it's it transforms into a
butterfly its stats stay the same for a
second and then the leopard is like
here's eight damage and it gets sniped
and you're like okay rip my 50 50. it is
also nice i feel like people don't
respect
that um
it also levels up on its own which
guarantees you higher tier units when
the levels pop is pretty good i i really
like it i would put it over an ant i
guess and
for when we see
maybe more like that
cat
i don't know what this does
cat when you buy shop food all animals
get plus one attack
oh it doubles food stats
i d okay well
i think it's bad
it's a lot of this is theory crafting
the problem is like you you immediately
start thinking in your head you know
you're like okay cat cow now i get like
4 4 milk and stuff like that but you
need so much capacity on your board to
be able to do this stuff
uh that
you you're going to have to end up if
you want to do the dream strategy you
have to sell out of the things that you
actually are attached to but i don't it
could be here as well but let's put it
here for the time being
i guess you could buy it buy a bunch of
food sell it buy something
chicken i gotta remember chicken as well
when you buy
food or a unit
it makes it's a plus one plus one to
everything in the shop
now and forever right
oh when you buy a tier one unit buffs
the shop forever
i gotta say we gotta speed up a little
bit
a lot bit um
i gotta say this is
also pretty bad
all the tier one enablers can be okay
um but i mean this is a tier five unit
itself which is nasty i would rather
just have the flexibility to buy cans
and then have like better
um animals on my squad
and i would also rather have a dragon
like the the dragon is
just a better version of this i think
squirrel i'm just gonna be honest with
you
i also kind of put it in the d tier
most of the time that i buy squirrel i'm
pissed off because i accidentally
overrun my
monsters or my animals with food where
i'm like i
i didn't want six food i just wanted
extra
food in the shop and now i gotta like
either roll and which point why did i
even do this
like i it just has no benefit sorry i
gotta speed up a little bit okay cal
you might not love
this
i think cow is high beat here maybe low
eights here
if you have capacity like you have some
garbage unit you don't mind selling
paying three gold for a a unit that
sucks but also allows you to divvy out
plus four plus four which could maybe
synergize with like some other food
buffs like a cow into a level two dodo
or something like that is sick
um
then it's amazing but there's a lot of
times where you're like i literally
can't even like do this because
everything on my board i'm attached to
like it's a four six by itself that is
not amazing i guess it's two gold that's
a good point you need capacity which you
don't always have late game and it is a
tier five but um
it's still it's still okay
yeah oh i don't know why i tried to drag
it to cell as if i was playing super
auto pets as we speak
[Laughter]
okay crab
i find it much like a badger it's kind
of situational early on again if you
have a super tanky unit that you've been
buffing for like your first few turns
then a crab pops up you're like okay
instead of a three three maybe i have
like a three eight or a three nine that
can win me some trades but i am not
excited to uh to take it most of the
time similarly i gotta tell you cricket
i don't really respect anymore
i think cricket is like
i i very rarely take it
even as a tier one now
i think you only really roll it when
you're rolling horse builds or dog
builds but i also don't or bison builds
maybe but i don't even really
roll those anymore um
so it's really it's it's kind of like a
three two but it sucks when you like
roll this and get crapped on by like a
hippo or something like that man it's
crazy um
i guess it does work well in front of
like an ox or something like that as
well but i i would rather take like
almost all tier one units over this
uh
and you always have options
it wins you the early game i don't think
so man honestly
i i genuinely don't think so
i i'm telling you fish man
fish and and beetle win you the early
game crocodile what is he seven three
does five damage to the weakest unit
i feel like it has a great effect and
bad stats
which for me
i'm just gonna level with you
that's a high c tier for me
does seven to the back oh to the last
unit
i thought
oh dolphin does to lowest hp
is really good when it is good
you know different people put units on
different lines but um if you hit a
turkey that's great if you hit a tiger
it's incredible sometimes you can hit
like a rooster and then instead of
summoning
uh like two roosters it'll or two chicks
it'll only summon one you could hit a
fly but seven three the stats are just
like not that impressive
honestly um
now deer is kind of interesting
it's one of my favorite
tier four units to take even if you're
only running it temporarily i think you
can you can place it in the mid eights
here
the caveat and it's actually kind of
nice the deer is like i'll level it up
to level two which is fine
um but then you also are you have a
decent unit out there that does really
well at level one and then you have the
capacity knowing that it sucks late game
to just
sell it and then start putting something
good in that place instead so i think
this is like a nice stop gap holder does
really well purging like melon armor off
units at the back
does really well triggering anything
that is like enemy intact enemy in front
of you attacks enemy and uh or animal in
front of you attacks animal in front of
you faints etc etc it's got some good
stuff going on okay dodo
i'm going faster okay dodo
high eights here
it's it's up here
the the only problem that i have with
the dodo it might even be close to the s
tier
you know what
i'm willing to put it there
the reason
the the only thing that sucks about it
is that so often i end up with like 50
attack units uh and then they have like
nine hp but that's not the dodo's fault
i also feel like if you like its level
two effect is incredible it's level
three effect is on maybe like the best
level three effect in the game
um
yeah it's really good plus it it sucks
up all the buffs and redistributes them
which is is nice
dog
put that in like
b tier if you build around it early and
you and you really
we we've had 10 win runs with dogs
they don't always pop oftentimes you're
going to want to sell but you can you
can scale it you can get it there
dolphin
i is very similar to crocodile for me if
i have three gold and i need to buy an
animal this is going to be like one of
the animals i'm most likely to buy and
then sell it in the next round you're
basically buying like an anti-cupcake
uh and also level two when it hits two
units is is pretty nasty
it can be very annoying and it ruins
some builds
like some the the dolphin runs might not
get to 10 wins but they're also going to
stop a lot of fly builds from getting
there
it doesn't hit 10 units what am i i'm
thinking about leopard then my mistake
dragon
i have to say this is for and maybe
controversial because it's a popular
animal for a number of reasons
i think it's okay its stats are okay the
problem with it is that in order for a
dragon to work you need the space on
your board to be able to sell
and buy tier one units to get the buffs
aoe scaling is insane
but it's the only way that you can
actually do this is to have it
contingent on having two spaces that you
can make it work on
which doesn't happen that often it you
have to have a very like specific run
for this to fit
uh into your build okay
imo at least
dromedary i think it's okay i like i
i've come down on it a little bit i
would say like maybe we're looking at a
c tier for a dromedary but it's okay i
would put it closer to like like right
on the beaver border line here maybe
maybe we'll throw that in in the end of
b for now duck
is is tight okay i'm gonna i'm gonna
throw you something controversial
i think duck is an a t or tier one
there is a a a poison pill to swallow
it's a one two so it sucks
but
you ex you you play for a draw hopefully
in round one or round two then you sell
all your ducks when you get that first
tier three promotion and all of a sudden
you can have like a like a five eight
blowfish on round three
and you will win enough games to
compensate for the one that it might
have lost you and it might not lose you
you might still draw with it i'm telling
you it's the way to go it's good it's
good
eagle
overrated but still decent i'm going to
put this in the beat here
not bad
maybe i understated a little bit
but i i think it's it's merely mid
elephant is like
high c okay it's it's a trap
in order like
this is like an anti-scaling unit the
more it levels up the worse it gets
uh unless you build your entire team
around
hurt triggers which
really wedges you into a specific
situation that you cannot escape from
fish
i mean i gotta tell you i think it's
it's like a better beetle
this is the unit i look for round one
round two
it you it's almost impossible to lose
one of your first two rounds with a
couple fish you will you will either win
or or come out even
flamingo
i know you can pill it okay so you kind
of buy it as a 3-1
use it for one round pill it and give
one one
i would be inclined to say that this is
somewhere in the b tier does okay with
the whale maybe
but i'm not
i would maybe say
you know
it's a b or c
it's a better ant it's a better duck
yeah but it's also a tier three
so it's not really like a better ant
because if i can't get it out there
until the enemies are already so much
stronger that the plus one plus one is
not as valuable as the plus two plus one
was earlier on you know
i was more valuable like a a cookie
when you're dying of hunger in the
desert or
like a feast when you're already full
anyway sorry sorry
um
fly
is a tier i would say not s
the only reason
it's not s
i feel like you can put a bat into
almost anything you could put a dodo
into almost anything
the fly
sometimes forces you to make some tough
choices because it itself sucks its
effect is incredible
all these are universally applicable
giraffe
call me crazy scaling oh my god i gotta
go so much faster
scaling is very valuable okay but
uh plus one plus one is too slow if you
level it up more then it gets good but
for now
not so much
similarly
goats
well i wouldn't put it at the very
bottom when you buy a friend you get one
gold i'm just telling you
buy sell meta is like one of the most
fun builds to play
with the shrimps and the goats and the
and the so-ons but i've never had a
great rum with it
so i think it belongs down here um
gorilla
i never do uh well with
because i always end up in a situation
where it dies in one hit but if it lives
through one hit it usually gets two
kills which is kind of amazing so
i would say gorilla can be in the a tier
hedgehog is very similar to badger but i
would say a little bit worse
put them back here a hedgehog at the
back can do some good stuff for you
you know it's the same thing it turns
losses into draws sometimes you get
draws into wins hippo now hippo
i'm merely going to place it in the a
tier
but it can definitely be in the s tier
it depends how early you can get it it
depends how quickly you can scale
sometimes it dies in one hit and you're
like this thing's a piece of crap
sometimes you go up against a white
weenie build and you don't even have to
use animals two through five so i i
genuinely love a hippo but i feel like
it's
it's not quite s horse
is fine but it's kind of a beginner trap
kangaroo though that's an eight-year
animal i don't know exactly where i'm
gonna put it
um but kangaroo is is insanely good if
you can get either a unit in front of it
that dies
and then spawns a unit and then dies or
a unit in front of it that's tanky and
it it scales like insanely i might you
know what
it fits a lot of builds i might even put
it there
uh ladybug actually like i'm sure i'm
probably using it wrong but
just a much worse beetle in my opinion
leopard
over
highly highly overrated
everybody wants me to buy this every
time it shows up
it's not good
i'm telling you in my opinion it's not
good i i don't know if i have ever lost
to a leopard
like for my 10 wins i lose to kangaroos
all the time i lose the flies i lose the
turkeys i lose to dogs i lose the
butterflies okay
i'm on my way apollo my mama we got five
minutes okay i've only got to rate 30
animals in that time
um i don't think i've ever lost to a
leopard okay like i'm just here we go
llama
too much of a workaround lobster nobody
knows what you do here we're going
faster alright you ready mammoth
useful
but overrated
microbes
low b tier
but when you build around it it blows
them out it blows them out
monkey everybody says the monkey's asked
here
you're crazy
i think it's like a a high b
high a
look i'm ranking it according to my
preferences but knowing that i'm off
based on what the populace says i will
do more labbing in the lavatory with the
monkey okay
mosquito
high c tier
octopus go ahead be mad we had the dream
octopus build the first time we ever had
it that anchored in our brain as the
octopus being a top tier unit it's never
happened again
it will never happen again i've never
seen it happen against me
anytime i see an octopus i'm like good
we're gonna smack it to death we we got
the most incredible octopus run of all
time it's time to let it live in the
past okay
otter
that's a mid b tier
tier one unit it's a nice it it comes
with like an apple it's a nice buy
and you don't feel bad about selling it
later owl
again situational 5'3 is good stats for
a tier three when you sell it you get so
you get a nice statistical benefit out
of it but is you're never gonna be like
oh no an owl
ox
most underrated unit in the game
parrot um
here's the thing right
a parroted turkey what if you just
parrot a turkey hey what if you just
parrot uh uh
you know a dog or something like that
okay what have you just had a second dog
what have you just had a
a second turkey right like you don't
need
both of these a tiger is incredible a
parrot is a trap and the fact that it
imprints whatever it gets i don't
respect it c tier peacock you already
know that's we're up here in the eights
here penguin
highly
highly overrated highly overrated
i'm gonna put that in the seat here as
well
the the fact that you need tier twos to
make it work is where it becomes
dangerous okay pig i'm not gonna
gigabrain you and put this in the a tier
but i do think it's high b
it basically costs you one gold to get a
two two temporarily early which is great
peacock a better peacock is a better or
sorry poodle
poodle is a better
penguin a better
penguin there's no doubt about it the
the poodle will scale your whole team if
you build it properly
puppy
can win you the game by itself rabbit
anything with food is not respectable
dirty rat worst unit in the game rhino
absolutely bodies white weenie builds
lose to loses to everything else but is
fine
rooster
is the slap of the city
it's the talk of the town
rooster is insanely good
i wouldn't say best unit of the game
while bats exist
but it's insanely good
dies to buses okay your bus is never
gonna get to my rooster because it's
gonna get on by whatever my front
line unit is and then you're gonna kill
my rooster and be like i won then tiger
rooster all of a sudden you got four you
know 51 chicks out there going bam bam
bam bam okay we go faster faster we got
one minute okay faster sauropod
i don't respect the gold builds late
scorpion situationally useful
temporarily
seal
 pisses me off because it's
always like hey if i eat something i'll
buff somebody else then i buy like sushi
and it hits every unit except the seal
and i'm like okay how about you don't
let the door hit yourself uh hit you on
the way out dumbass shark a tier a
functional must-have unit
sheep
does well sometimes
uh shrimp i'm just gonna be honest with
you
it's probably like the most fun unit in
the game that sucks
i i buy it almost every time uh but
it's not good and then sometimes i've
run two of them and it's just
it's insane but it's hilarious him me
him him me skunk
temporarily useful at best snail a tier
plus two plus two on everything is
insane snake
wins games spiders
keeps the end games swans i overrated
them for a while i would say this is a b
tier unit t-rex
everybody loves scaling
i would say this could fit in your a
tier tabby cat plus one attacks uh
temporarily tell me you never get bought
without telling me you never get bought
tiger
is s you just put it behind the s tier
unit and then it's automatically s by
definition tropical fish i overrated it
for a long time turkey wins you the game
by itself tortel
easy melon armor early in the game whale
double faint triggers is disgusting worm
tell me you're about to lose the game
without telling me you're about to lose
the game this is it prince screen the
definitive tier list
of super auto pets and we were only one
minute late i stand by all of my
rankings until i play more of this uh
one
a week from now we'll do a reevaluate
and then see how they compare that's not
a promise by the way



hello in record time
we must do
a super auto pets tier list this is only
the free to play units oh wait every
unit in base pack and pack one
really because i don't see a bat
am i crazy where where's my bad
that that's my indicator
it's position oh there it is right there
literally at the top
[Laughter]
so we're gonna rank every unit okay
we're gonna do it
s a b c d big ups to
mcd 644 for making a list here picture
of an uh super pet right there
themselves would you look at that uh
it's in alphabetical order okay
just imagine
this is squeeze me this is juice me
tease me freeze me
reprieve me i don't want to see you
anymore okay let's get started ant tier
one unit two one gives another unit two
one when it dies
i would be inclined to say if if you see
an ant in your first shop
that's a that's a juice me
you take it as a gimme the ant will win
you early rounds
without a doubt
and it has a synergy late where you can
pill it in order to buy me kill me
exactly i see people in chat saying buy
me kill me fish if you get one fish and
one ant in your first shop plus one roll
you you win draws and you get free wins
it's a dream come true i love it give me
uh or you i guess you could take ant
beetle as well that would be fine i love
it okay a tier maybe not quite s but
eight here
uh hatching chick this is a tough one
okay
level one gives plus five plus five
temporarily to the unit in front of it
level two gives plus two plus two
permanently level three
gives you experience on the unit in
front of it so if you can level it up
it's great it's also uh i mean like i
might even be asked here
five five early is insane like one of
the ways that i've managed to make this
work okay listen it's a tier three unit
okay let's just place it here for now
it's a tier three unit
uh so you can buy it
by the time you buy it maybe you've got
like a seven seven fish or something
like that a seven seven beetle uh a
seven seven pig maybe
now you've got a 12 12 if you put some
garlic armor on it you're you're
multiple times
this basically just enables your your
tankiest unit to wipe the entire enemy
squad by yourself is very useful i would
stop short of putting it in the s tier
because it's weird
the plus five plus five is amazing it's
like s tier useful
the plus two plus two is only okay i
actually think it gets temporarily less
useful but it's a necessary step but if
you can get it to level three early
then like this could be s tier again so
i'm gonna balance it out in the eighth
here okay
badger
i'm going to put them down in the seats
here i mean no disrespect i think it
starts as a 5-4 when it dies it deals
its attack damage to all remaining
uh to adjacent enemies so you put this
on or adjacent animals you put this on
your back line when it dies it'll
probably kill their
their unit if they still have a unit
so it it draws
losses
doesn't really win you draws but it's
it's interest i think it's situational
the way that i play this sometimes is
like
on turn three
you develop a unit so that you get to
tier three units if it's a badger i'm
like i'll take it five four stats are
uh are are pretty good early and then i
sell it from that point onwards if it
gets sniped that's disastrous
okay i think this is fair badger with b
wins you draws
uh
i mean technically true but are we
evaluating it based on uh if you add
another
three gold onto it because i mean if
we're talking about that then there's a
lot of these units that would change my
evaluation of
i also like
this is not just based on what i like to
run it's also based on like what i've
played against
and let me tell you when i see a badger
on the enemy team the first thing i
think to myself is like
this is at worst to draw most of the
time it's a win
when i when i run into a badger i'm not
saying i've never lost but i've uh
i mean it's not deed here but i've
definitely crushed
most badger teams versus like if i see
an early peacock or an early kangaroo on
the enemy team i'm like okay let's
cancel christmas
now bat it's not even close bat is
actually like uh in my opinion i'm not
an esports guy but i'm gonna pretend to
sound like one bat is a meta defining
unit it's so
uh
omnipotent well um i'm the present i
don't like how the word comes out of my
mouth but
uh weak is
you will see this every
second round if you play free to play
like it almost needs its own tear it's
it's crazy
weakness
uh
is not just great
like let's go over weakness okay
it
causes every attack that hits that enemy
to do five extra damage
which is bs that's crazy it also purges
whatever equipment they had on them
before and equipment was like insanely
uh important for so many different units
sorry it's not even free to play i mean
pay to win sorry sorry
it's it's totally oppressive i think if
you're gonna make it that
i i think weak needs to be nerfed
in the sense that i think it should only
block
or it should only make
the first attack do extra damage
it making every attack do extra damage
is insane
maybe you nerf the bat somehow instead
like maybe at level one a bat doesn't do
much extra
like like it can transform or something
like level two it has weakness level
three it has two weakness because three
is crazy but
um or maybe it pops on faint or
something like that that's interesting
but it's too good for now i think
they're always gonna have it run
overrun equipment but uh
or do you move it up a tier maybe or
something like that so it's much harder
to get a level three but it's the the
bad is so good like it's crazy talk
um so i the beaver you got to evaluate
it within the context of
the situation that it's in right uh this
is this is a tier one i think a beaver
is like a perfect
b-tier
tier one animal
the way that you do it you you don't
really rely on it
you you buy it for one round
and then you sell it to buff the units
that are gonna stick around like the
strategy that i have i'll try to buy
either a fish or a beetle
in the first couple of rounds literally
in the first round if i buy a beaver to
augment it that's great because in round
two i sell the beaver
it
buffs the fish in all likelihood as long
as you do your order right and all of a
sudden you know you've got like uh
you got like a three five fish that
maybe gets buffed even beyond that i
think it's pretty good i i think i think
given that you own the thing is you only
care about it be when it shows up in the
first round or the second round but i i
respect it in the b tier for
sure beetle
is is a tough one okay i'm gonna i'm
gonna put beetle at the high beat here
beetle is insane early
but its actual effect is garbage it's
terrible
i know you never roll food builds nl
like this is
uh something you shouldn't do but like
it's
it's the stats are awesome the two three
wins you rounds early it doesn't scale
at all so i think a b tier
knowing that you get rid of it after
that is pretty good okay now we're gonna
start making some enemies i think pretty
soon
uh the bison
i always get it confused this is maybe
this is an ox i can't remember no i know
it's or the
buffalo but anyway
it's really good
when you get its effect to work okay the
way that its effect works is that you
need to have at least a tier three then
it gets plus two plus two every turn
otherwise it's just a six six that does
nothing so if you can get this early
genuinely
you could maybe have it in the sa tier
i really rarely end up taking it because
by the time i get like a
a bison it's very rare for me to have a
uh a tier three unit or even be close
sometimes i'll have a tier two and be
three away but still
um
so i'd actually put it down here in the
seat here but i still put it over badger
honestly
now i gotta tell you blowfish
i used to think it was ester i used to
think it was the strongest
uh unit in the game
i've come down on it a little bit
i would rather have
a peacock i would rather have a kangaroo
i'd rather have a couple of things you
know going on here
but the blowfish i think is still pretty
good
you can it it at least not everything
that you buy is something that you have
to level up forever sometimes you just
buy things temporarily to help you win
some rounds so there's situations where
like maybe
you a blowfish shows up in your shop you
buy the blowfish you know you get a
turtle or something like that and then
all of a sudden you're like i got a
tanky unit it's got melon armor it gets
a couple of ability procs and then it's
like good to go
but overall this is like a maybe buy for
me sometimes
now
i know that people are going to be like
you're you're stacking up one tier in
particular here
um
bluebird
is also around here in the beats here
like
scaling is nice don't get me wrong
i think scaling is is
valuable
um
but i would rather have like a fish or
something like that
early on for sure because at one hp this
thing not only does it not live but it
only trades with like half of the tier
one animals so i i think that it could
be good um
and i do run it sometimes most of the
time i find i would rather just spend
three hp on another copy of an existing
good unit that will buff it by one one
instead of relying on this guy because
he basically exists just to get killed
um
but that's okay it's situational but
decent okay sometimes uh what the heck
does the does the buffalo do
every time you buy a friend he gets plus
one plus one right
so it's like it's a strictly superior
dog
um
look
i'm going to put a smack dab in the
middle of the beats here
i think that again it a lot of these
depend on situations right it can scale
like crazy if it shows up early
otherwise like if you get it in the late
game you're like okay it's a six six or
a seven seven or a four six maybe now
that i think about it like
it's not great but at the same time
you're also like uh i guess if a beetle
shows up in the late game you also don't
really care
[Laughter]
to be honest but um i i find it's okay
but i would rather build around a hippo
in the same tier than build around the
the buffalo
now camel
i've only started doing it recently but
i actually think camel is an a tier
unit
so if you're not familiar with the camel
i would even i might even put it there
for now
camel
when it gets hurt gives the unit behind
it plus two plus one or
plus four plus two or plus six plus
three depending on its uh
uh on its tier level
as long as you get something
behind it that benefits from that
it's crazy i mean again you the camel's
tier three right you can have a camel in
front of even like your your great tier
one unit all of a sudden you know
there's multiple i've been taking a
camel like every time it shows up lately
you can have like a 15 15 fish
once they finally punch through your
camel and you know then they just lose
like nothing else can happen
um it does super well with the kangaroo
does super well with a peacock does well
with the blowfish any anything behind it
that gets a benefit when it gets hurt
gets better because of the fact that uh
you know
gaining that extra hp is worth a lot
this is really good like that i love the
camel
uh
caterpillar
i i would honestly
you this might surprise you i would
actually put it in the eights here it is
hard to rank
i think people might have thought i was
shooting for like a lower tier here but
if you get a caterpillar within like the
first couple of rounds that the tier
threes are available i think you
basically take it
no matter what because it you just rely
on getting another
great unit and it copies it
you can't put equipment on it which
sucks you kind of need like a turtle to
enable it
i think it's good man like honestly i
respect it there's one thing that sucks
about it it gets bodied hard by like
leopard and dolphin depending on where
you put it
um
like when you
it sucks when it transforms into like
whatever it's it transforms into a
butterfly its stats stay the same for a
second and then the leopard is like
here's eight damage and it gets sniped
and you're like okay rip my 50 50. it is
also nice i feel like people don't
respect
that um
it also levels up on its own which
guarantees you higher tier units when
the levels pop is pretty good i i really
like it i would put it over an ant i
guess and
for when we see
maybe more like that
cat
i don't know what this does
cat when you buy shop food all animals
get plus one attack
oh it doubles food stats
i d okay well
i think it's bad
it's a lot of this is theory crafting
the problem is like you you immediately
start thinking in your head you know
you're like okay cat cow now i get like
4 4 milk and stuff like that but you
need so much capacity on your board to
be able to do this stuff
uh that
you you're going to have to end up if
you want to do the dream strategy you
have to sell out of the things that you
actually are attached to but i don't it
could be here as well but let's put it
here for the time being
i guess you could buy it buy a bunch of
food sell it buy something
chicken i gotta remember chicken as well
when you buy
food or a unit
it makes it's a plus one plus one to
everything in the shop
now and forever right
oh when you buy a tier one unit buffs
the shop forever
i gotta say we gotta speed up a little
bit
a lot bit um
i gotta say this is
also pretty bad
all the tier one enablers can be okay
um but i mean this is a tier five unit
itself which is nasty i would rather
just have the flexibility to buy cans
and then have like better
um animals on my squad
and i would also rather have a dragon
like the the dragon is
just a better version of this i think
squirrel i'm just gonna be honest with
you
i also kind of put it in the d tier
most of the time that i buy squirrel i'm
pissed off because i accidentally
overrun my
monsters or my animals with food where
i'm like i
i didn't want six food i just wanted
extra
food in the shop and now i gotta like
either roll and which point why did i
even do this
like i it just has no benefit sorry i
gotta speed up a little bit okay cal
you might not love
this
i think cow is high beat here maybe low
eights here
if you have capacity like you have some
garbage unit you don't mind selling
paying three gold for a a unit that
sucks but also allows you to divvy out
plus four plus four which could maybe
synergize with like some other food
buffs like a cow into a level two dodo
or something like that is sick
um
then it's amazing but there's a lot of
times where you're like i literally
can't even like do this because
everything on my board i'm attached to
like it's a four six by itself that is
not amazing i guess it's two gold that's
a good point you need capacity which you
don't always have late game and it is a
tier five but um
it's still it's still okay
yeah oh i don't know why i tried to drag
it to cell as if i was playing super
auto pets as we speak
[Laughter]
okay crab
i find it much like a badger it's kind
of situational early on again if you
have a super tanky unit that you've been
buffing for like your first few turns
then a crab pops up you're like okay
instead of a three three maybe i have
like a three eight or a three nine that
can win me some trades but i am not
excited to uh to take it most of the
time similarly i gotta tell you cricket
i don't really respect anymore
i think cricket is like
i i very rarely take it
even as a tier one now
i think you only really roll it when
you're rolling horse builds or dog
builds but i also don't or bison builds
maybe but i don't even really
roll those anymore um
so it's really it's it's kind of like a
three two but it sucks when you like
roll this and get crapped on by like a
hippo or something like that man it's
crazy um
i guess it does work well in front of
like an ox or something like that as
well but i i would rather take like
almost all tier one units over this
uh
and you always have options
it wins you the early game i don't think
so man honestly
i i genuinely don't think so
i i'm telling you fish man
fish and and beetle win you the early
game crocodile what is he seven three
does five damage to the weakest unit
i feel like it has a great effect and
bad stats
which for me
i'm just gonna level with you
that's a high c tier for me
does seven to the back oh to the last
unit
i thought
oh dolphin does to lowest hp
is really good when it is good
you know different people put units on
different lines but um if you hit a
turkey that's great if you hit a tiger
it's incredible sometimes you can hit
like a rooster and then instead of
summoning
uh like two roosters it'll or two chicks
it'll only summon one you could hit a
fly but seven three the stats are just
like not that impressive
honestly um
now deer is kind of interesting
it's one of my favorite
tier four units to take even if you're
only running it temporarily i think you
can you can place it in the mid eights
here
the caveat and it's actually kind of
nice the deer is like i'll level it up
to level two which is fine
um but then you also are you have a
decent unit out there that does really
well at level one and then you have the
capacity knowing that it sucks late game
to just
sell it and then start putting something
good in that place instead so i think
this is like a nice stop gap holder does
really well purging like melon armor off
units at the back
does really well triggering anything
that is like enemy intact enemy in front
of you attacks enemy and uh or animal in
front of you attacks animal in front of
you faints etc etc it's got some good
stuff going on okay dodo
i'm going faster okay dodo
high eights here
it's it's up here
the the only problem that i have with
the dodo it might even be close to the s
tier
you know what
i'm willing to put it there
the reason
the the only thing that sucks about it
is that so often i end up with like 50
attack units uh and then they have like
nine hp but that's not the dodo's fault
i also feel like if you like its level
two effect is incredible it's level
three effect is on maybe like the best
level three effect in the game
um
yeah it's really good plus it it sucks
up all the buffs and redistributes them
which is is nice
dog
put that in like
b tier if you build around it early and
you and you really
we we've had 10 win runs with dogs
they don't always pop oftentimes you're
going to want to sell but you can you
can scale it you can get it there
dolphin
i is very similar to crocodile for me if
i have three gold and i need to buy an
animal this is going to be like one of
the animals i'm most likely to buy and
then sell it in the next round you're
basically buying like an anti-cupcake
uh and also level two when it hits two
units is is pretty nasty
it can be very annoying and it ruins
some builds
like some the the dolphin runs might not
get to 10 wins but they're also going to
stop a lot of fly builds from getting
there
it doesn't hit 10 units what am i i'm
thinking about leopard then my mistake
dragon
i have to say this is for and maybe
controversial because it's a popular
animal for a number of reasons
i think it's okay its stats are okay the
problem with it is that in order for a
dragon to work you need the space on
your board to be able to sell
and buy tier one units to get the buffs
aoe scaling is insane
but it's the only way that you can
actually do this is to have it
contingent on having two spaces that you
can make it work on
which doesn't happen that often it you
have to have a very like specific run
for this to fit
uh into your build okay
imo at least
dromedary i think it's okay i like i
i've come down on it a little bit i
would say like maybe we're looking at a
c tier for a dromedary but it's okay i
would put it closer to like like right
on the beaver border line here maybe
maybe we'll throw that in in the end of
b for now duck
is is tight okay i'm gonna i'm gonna
throw you something controversial
i think duck is an a t or tier one
there is a a a poison pill to swallow
it's a one two so it sucks
but
you ex you you play for a draw hopefully
in round one or round two then you sell
all your ducks when you get that first
tier three promotion and all of a sudden
you can have like a like a five eight
blowfish on round three
and you will win enough games to
compensate for the one that it might
have lost you and it might not lose you
you might still draw with it i'm telling
you it's the way to go it's good it's
good
eagle
overrated but still decent i'm going to
put this in the beat here
not bad
maybe i understated a little bit
but i i think it's it's merely mid
elephant is like
high c okay it's it's a trap
in order like
this is like an anti-scaling unit the
more it levels up the worse it gets
uh unless you build your entire team
around
hurt triggers which
really wedges you into a specific
situation that you cannot escape from
fish
i mean i gotta tell you i think it's
it's like a better beetle
this is the unit i look for round one
round two
it you it's almost impossible to lose
one of your first two rounds with a
couple fish you will you will either win
or or come out even
flamingo
i know you can pill it okay so you kind
of buy it as a 3-1
use it for one round pill it and give
one one
i would be inclined to say that this is
somewhere in the b tier does okay with
the whale maybe
but i'm not
i would maybe say
you know
it's a b or c
it's a better ant it's a better duck
yeah but it's also a tier three
so it's not really like a better ant
because if i can't get it out there
until the enemies are already so much
stronger that the plus one plus one is
not as valuable as the plus two plus one
was earlier on you know
i was more valuable like a a cookie
when you're dying of hunger in the
desert or
like a feast when you're already full
anyway sorry sorry
um
fly
is a tier i would say not s
the only reason
it's not s
i feel like you can put a bat into
almost anything you could put a dodo
into almost anything
the fly
sometimes forces you to make some tough
choices because it itself sucks its
effect is incredible
all these are universally applicable
giraffe
call me crazy scaling oh my god i gotta
go so much faster
scaling is very valuable okay but
uh plus one plus one is too slow if you
level it up more then it gets good but
for now
not so much
similarly
goats
well i wouldn't put it at the very
bottom when you buy a friend you get one
gold i'm just telling you
buy sell meta is like one of the most
fun builds to play
with the shrimps and the goats and the
and the so-ons but i've never had a
great rum with it
so i think it belongs down here um
gorilla
i never do uh well with
because i always end up in a situation
where it dies in one hit but if it lives
through one hit it usually gets two
kills which is kind of amazing so
i would say gorilla can be in the a tier
hedgehog is very similar to badger but i
would say a little bit worse
put them back here a hedgehog at the
back can do some good stuff for you
you know it's the same thing it turns
losses into draws sometimes you get
draws into wins hippo now hippo
i'm merely going to place it in the a
tier
but it can definitely be in the s tier
it depends how early you can get it it
depends how quickly you can scale
sometimes it dies in one hit and you're
like this thing's a piece of crap
sometimes you go up against a white
weenie build and you don't even have to
use animals two through five so i i
genuinely love a hippo but i feel like
it's
it's not quite s horse
is fine but it's kind of a beginner trap
kangaroo though that's an eight-year
animal i don't know exactly where i'm
gonna put it
um but kangaroo is is insanely good if
you can get either a unit in front of it
that dies
and then spawns a unit and then dies or
a unit in front of it that's tanky and
it it scales like insanely i might you
know what
it fits a lot of builds i might even put
it there
uh ladybug actually like i'm sure i'm
probably using it wrong but
just a much worse beetle in my opinion
leopard
over
highly highly overrated
everybody wants me to buy this every
time it shows up
it's not good
i'm telling you in my opinion it's not
good i i don't know if i have ever lost
to a leopard
like for my 10 wins i lose to kangaroos
all the time i lose the flies i lose the
turkeys i lose to dogs i lose the
butterflies okay
i'm on my way apollo my mama we got five
minutes okay i've only got to rate 30
animals in that time
um i don't think i've ever lost to a
leopard okay like i'm just here we go
llama
too much of a workaround lobster nobody
knows what you do here we're going
faster alright you ready mammoth
useful
but overrated
microbes
low b tier
but when you build around it it blows
them out it blows them out
monkey everybody says the monkey's asked
here
you're crazy
i think it's like a a high b
high a
look i'm ranking it according to my
preferences but knowing that i'm off
based on what the populace says i will
do more labbing in the lavatory with the
monkey okay
mosquito
high c tier
octopus go ahead be mad we had the dream
octopus build the first time we ever had
it that anchored in our brain as the
octopus being a top tier unit it's never
happened again
it will never happen again i've never
seen it happen against me
anytime i see an octopus i'm like good
we're gonna smack it to death we we got
the most incredible octopus run of all
time it's time to let it live in the
past okay
otter
that's a mid b tier
tier one unit it's a nice it it comes
with like an apple it's a nice buy
and you don't feel bad about selling it
later owl
again situational 5'3 is good stats for
a tier three when you sell it you get so
you get a nice statistical benefit out
of it but is you're never gonna be like
oh no an owl
ox
most underrated unit in the game
parrot um
here's the thing right
a parroted turkey what if you just
parrot a turkey hey what if you just
parrot uh uh
you know a dog or something like that
okay what have you just had a second dog
what have you just had a
a second turkey right like you don't
need
both of these a tiger is incredible a
parrot is a trap and the fact that it
imprints whatever it gets i don't
respect it c tier peacock you already
know that's we're up here in the eights
here penguin
highly
highly overrated highly overrated
i'm gonna put that in the seat here as
well
the the fact that you need tier twos to
make it work is where it becomes
dangerous okay pig i'm not gonna
gigabrain you and put this in the a tier
but i do think it's high b
it basically costs you one gold to get a
two two temporarily early which is great
peacock a better peacock is a better or
sorry poodle
poodle is a better
penguin a better
penguin there's no doubt about it the
the poodle will scale your whole team if
you build it properly
puppy
can win you the game by itself rabbit
anything with food is not respectable
dirty rat worst unit in the game rhino
absolutely bodies white weenie builds
lose to loses to everything else but is
fine
rooster
is the slap of the city
it's the talk of the town
rooster is insanely good
i wouldn't say best unit of the game
while bats exist
but it's insanely good
dies to buses okay your bus is never
gonna get to my rooster because it's
gonna get on by whatever my front
line unit is and then you're gonna kill
my rooster and be like i won then tiger
rooster all of a sudden you got four you
know 51 chicks out there going bam bam
bam bam okay we go faster faster we got
one minute okay faster sauropod
i don't respect the gold builds late
scorpion situationally useful
temporarily
seal
 pisses me off because it's
always like hey if i eat something i'll
buff somebody else then i buy like sushi
and it hits every unit except the seal
and i'm like okay how about you don't
let the door hit yourself uh hit you on
the way out dumbass shark a tier a
functional must-have unit
sheep
does well sometimes
uh shrimp i'm just gonna be honest with
you
it's probably like the most fun unit in
the game that sucks
i i buy it almost every time uh but
it's not good and then sometimes i've
run two of them and it's just
it's insane but it's hilarious him me
him him me skunk
temporarily useful at best snail a tier
plus two plus two on everything is
insane snake
wins games spiders
keeps the end games swans i overrated
them for a while i would say this is a b
tier unit t-rex
everybody loves scaling
i would say this could fit in your a
tier tabby cat plus one attacks uh
temporarily tell me you never get bought
without telling me you never get bought
tiger
is s you just put it behind the s tier
unit and then it's automatically s by
definition tropical fish i overrated it
for a long time turkey wins you the game
by itself tortel
easy melon armor early in the game whale
double faint triggers is disgusting worm
tell me you're about to lose the game
without telling me you're about to lose
the game this is it prince screen the
definitive tier list
of super auto pets and we were only one
minute late i stand by all of my
rankings until i play more of this uh
one
a week from now we'll do a reevaluate
and then see how they compare that's not
a promise by the way



hey everybody welcome back it's super
auto pants um having
some decent runs lately obviously you
always wish you could do a little bit
better we we haven't had a a run
where we like blew the doors off
recently but that's okay maybe it all
starts with a good team name
how about the broken ice cubes
excuse me while i clear my throat i
think this is a losing team early
um
i don't see how that could not be the
case
no i think it's a draw ring team early
[Laughter]
yeah okay lucky us just barely it's not
my ideal like first shop run for sure
let me tell you that um
now this is a little bit more like it i
definitely like a beetle
two threes the stats are just disgusting
we take our chances
you love to see it
i think we still like a 2-2 that gives
basically plus two
pig is okay it sets up a nice future
turn
this is a little bit more like it
i would say roll me one more time
i would say freeze me
okay
now obviously like a horse would hit the
spot here but
or a dog for that matter but you don't
really see too many like white weenie
style decks here
they are basically decks i guess now
that i think about it
you peace
i don't see how this could be anything
but a loss
i mean ants just win in a lot of
situations
and then we're only gonna be doing four
damage to you yeah so this is a loss i
mean just it's just a beefy cricket back
there beefy beetle back there we only
lost by one damage that's okay we don't
sweat those man
that's unsweatable in my house
plenty of room to work with here okay
do a a shrimp is a funny build okay
you peace
i don't think we want it
um
uh we should we should have taken the
shrimp if we were going to do that but
i i don't trust the rap babe people are
saying the rabbit's a little underrated
if that's the case you know what
if that's the case i'm willing to get a
little freaky okay
i'm willing to give
very freaky
i don't necessarily expect this to work
if it doesn't i'll probably hit the
escape key and restart the run
um
it is a level two cricket
please buff that creature
level two cricket
this is a loss
madame gifts work
i mean all things considered i know i
say that a lot when we lose
we we took a bit of a lark on that one
you can't be too upset
you love a bat don't get me wrong while
our team sucks though i think a hedgehog
is kind of an interesting idea
um
and i'm just trying to roll like
something that's not a bat for the time
being
look
this is not meant to be a throw i'm just
like while we have the rabbit i think
you invest in future considerations
man this is pretty ugly don't don't
don't okay that's fine
i think this is another loss
just hit the button just
just just go ahead
well thanks for watching everybody hope
you enjoyed the uh
hope you enjoyed the episode there um
we're gonna run it back four minutes in
here
this is a great this is the the squad of
dreams
now i know in
historically
i have said i'm not a huge fan
be the adorable piggies
um i'm not a huge fan of the bird
turn one
you get a but you could do worse let's
put it that way you could do worse than
a bird i mean don't you know when
haven't you heard haven't you heard the
bird is the let's go
we still
draw
but just barely
that's the best what the heck it's the
best way it could have gone for us i
think
so we like this
honestly we keep this maybe we don't
keep it frozen anymore but i think we
can just roll once
and maybe invest in our uh in our fish
for the time being it's gonna be a 7-4
but really it's actually like a nine to
five like dolly pardon
shoot my fish
let's go i think
i don't know if it could have gone
better than that
i think this is uh
it's a draw again
because you shot my fish but i think
anything else you shot would have
created the same results so i'm not
i'm not sweating it dr skoctopus what a
name now
this is where things get interesting i
don't mind the sheep early i think a
sheep early can do some work man
and a ba to you as
well why don't you hit me with one of
these hit my fish please
that's not so bad we're going to roll
this bird for a bit
now a fish on the other well we have to
buy something here we might as well buy
this um do we buff a fish or do we buff
a ram i think you buff a fish
you can tune a fish
but you can't tune a piano is that that
joke
i don't remember
10 for fish versus 10-4 fish what an
what an interesting situation we got
here
this is uh the oh i was gonna say it's a
draw but i forgot our ram creates some
uh
detritus after it dies look at that we
got our first win we're at one loss zero
losses all right i'm a believer in this
squad right now
i still think this is a heavy sell even
if it hits this bird but you did life
goes on
we i don't love a spider but it does fit
the present mechanics of our build
i think
we love the concept of adding a swan
into this and a 10-4 i like that fish
but we're gonna start to invest in our
swan instead
and you know
i think i'm okay with that
i'm not promising you the world here but
but two extra gold per turn is uh it's
got some spice associated with it hey
that would have paid for buying a spider
and then selling it back on the same
turn
you might think that it's a mistake all
i would say in response to that
is that i think the bigger mistake would
have been to just hold on to it because
we bought it this turn and then you get
that like endowment effect and you uh
you know end up suffering as a result
then you go the spider's not that good
well yeah that's why you know it can be
good at one
data point in time and then bad at the
next it happens
so i think we like it
i think we will invest in maybe trying
to get to a level two fish
that seems fine to me
and then while we're here
you're gonna stick around
for a bid
so let's buff you the most
the sheep is the next to go but before
we get rid of the sheep we'll probably
combine the swans
the sheep does not do well here
that's unfortunate
maybe it's not so bad
i mean the bat bodies us here but that's
fine we then two for one
um i think we definitely die to uh the
rams actually
but even if we got through the rams like
we didn't have the hp necessary to get
through the dog
but that's okay we leverage our our
present in order to improve our future
it's pretty amazing
and these are some some strong units
i'm even like i'm in a buy me sell me
mood right here man
hey tomo you okay buddy
i think we do it like this
turtle's always nice you know and then
i'm kind of
i guess you freeze it just in case
so i'm not promising you the world on
this run either but uh
we're gonna have a level two swan which
should unlock maybe tier four units for
us tier five units maybe um no bat
that's nice to see
we've been debuffed a little
life goes on
i don't think that went as badly for us
as you might have assumed
i think we win it it really comes down
to the the skunk
versus the swan and i'll i'll bet on a
swan in that situation hey tomorrow
what's wrong man you doing all righty
okay so dump this where three wins one
loss
tier five eats shop food random friends
get plus one plus one we might start
becoming a heavy buyer here
i'm thinking it's like a sell me
buy me
buy me
buy me
buy me
freeze me
garlic me for the swan or the fish i
don't know it's it's a bit strange this
is not a typical squad necessarily i
don't really know like what a seal does
long term
level two bat is a piece of garbage but
if it hits the seal which it didn't
[Laughter]
we would have been okay
because we would have had the melon
armor on top but i mean we're still okay
and we're
okay
and we're okay
and we're okay and this is a win
sorry i'm leaning a little bit out of
frame by the way my my good son tomo's
here hey tomo
hello
okay so we want level three bird for now
microbe plus turtle is disgusting
i think we should try
i think you sell your fish even though
the stats are amazing you roll a microbe
up front
you keep investing in your in your
turtle
garlic doesn't apply to anybody anymore
so like we we basically are forced to
roll
no you want the melon armor to pop later
we're forced to roll for a better
situation here
five one three five two
you would sell a bird
to roll a poodle
i'm not fully sold
this is a huge pivot for us by the way
so this this represents a big change
obviously garlic on the bird is no
longer applicable but they can't take
away the winds we've already gotten from
it
okay so your your bison is
is going to be and also ran here
we crush you on this this this this is a
win i mean most people are not going to
be equipped to handle the the micro
build early here
this is a pretty early pivot for it
now we're hoping to roll into a level
two turtle would would make a big
difference
rhino
rhino behind the turtle in this
situation is really appealing to me
especially when you consider all the
weakness
i think we can sell our bird i know it's
a level three the garlic armor is
irrelevant
but i'm telling you
this build
is gonna slap no reason to buy garlics
apples are i mean i guess you just apple
you
you could roll a b
no because it's going to get overridden
anyway
i always i'm out thinking myself we can
roll a quick salad let's go lucky little
force multiplier there
feel like you might as well freeze might
as well roll might as well unfreeze this
i don't know how long i've had that
active but um so the hope is i mean
another level turtle is sick but the
hope is also that this rhino basically
goes infinite uh once everybody gets
weakness applied i'm a little worried
about the effects of this so-called
chili pepper oh never mind
no
you you did to me what i was trying to
do to you
okay well that you know what you gotta
say fair play on that one valentino well
done
your your rhino beats my rhino
checkmate
bro you gotta give me this turtle
hey tomo
i i think maybe you start to think about
selling
your seal
it has done good buffing itself
where it's an investment
so that we have some space to work with
freeze me just in case but i'm do i'm
fishing for this freaking turtle man i
am fishing for this freaking turtle get
buffed get buffed
get sold get bought this rhino i'm
telling you
it has infinite power the infinity stone
within it
level one turtle okay i see
i see the problem your bat becomes
useless thankfully
we're going to remove your melon armor
then we're going to live
and we're going to hit you it's not
going to kill you then you're going to
kill me
oh you peace
you live by one
i mean you live by one unit but it's
also one hp okay so we're down to our
last life here i mean we really need
this next turtle
hey tomorrow
i'm telling you if we get
one turtle or a chocolate bar it changes
everything for us
we don't need a dragon this is also
gonna get sold um and you're probably
taking some armor here is there anything
like we i know like one up is it gets
overridden on everybody but the microbe
there's not much reason to have it on
the microbe
i gotta let this guy out of the office
oh okay um
buy me
sell me
freeze me i know you're gonna be like
what are you doing well this is a roll
actually roll me once we'll roll a
leopard here and it's the the leopard is
just to exist or maybe a mammoth
but we need the mammoth more at the
front that's not really a good play the
leopard's kind of stinky though
ah we'll give it a try i mean i don't
think it's stinky overall i think it's
stinky temporarily this level two turtle
though i i completely believe in it the
rhino is like the biggest trap in the
game man it gets me every time
level three caterpillar it's only going
to become a 1921 though that's not that
spooky
weakness overrides your garlic armor
that's fantastic
it's a nice little smack there what the
heck you got a microbe too
where did that come from
no
no two
bruh
okay well we what was that five dude we
can't get over the five hump lately
i'm running one more back you can't stop
me it's my day off
this is a squad
this is a squad
i want to keep that beaver frozen
squeaky
nefarious
craters what an excellent band name
hello my son
you okay
this is an interesting is it everything
about this looks like a draw to me but i
very famously have no idea what i'm
talking about so
i'm pretty sure this is a draw
no sweat
i think you can
buy me
sell me
that's the dream setup
roll me because i don't love those units
you're going to combine me next turn
you're going to roll a fish at the back
you're going to roll me one more time
honestly bird was okay for us last time
pardon me but the stats on the beetle
are
are really good like a 2 3
tends to hit above its its weight class
and we got a few of them oh no
did you see his hat
it's a fedora with safari flaps at the
back
this looks like a this looks like a
guaranteed
statistical draw to me oh well i had one
more hp so i'll take the win there if
that doesn't bother you
then this is your easy mode play you
know we get a four five
which i have absolutely no problem with
we stack you up at the front here
i like this
um
freeze me roll me
peacock peacock
salt peanut
um
sell me
knowing that
we're gonna pill you later
then you're actually gonna take this
spot up here you're going to take this
spot behind the ants
we're going to freeze you we're going to
freeze you keep that that flamingo out
here 6 10 peacock early is going to ruin
a lot of people's days
this this makes me a bad man
we throw in a little extra garlic on top
you know the the world's your oyster hey
tomorrow
hello buddy
my sweet boy
so we're killing everybody but the fish
the fish has three hp
this is not bad
i'm not saying this is a 10 spot but
we're on on some good momentum to
possibly get
to get over the the five hump hopefully
um maybe i should
not kill my chickens before they hatch
pig's gonna stick well you know what pig
and chick are gonna stick around the pig
benefits most from the stats right now
so let's do it like that
unfortunately
we do need to
we need to fill a squad
this will take us to nine right
that means we could oh but we can't roll
these we could buy
roll and then we have space to put
something else in here
i don't know man i don't know i don't
know what i'm thinking really
she give me one of those
what is it my man
freeze me and by freezing me i mean
leave okay hey tommo you wanna do you
want to show up on camera will we fight
the
sticky eyes apparently not that's okay
hey level one bat
didn't hit my peacock that's all i could
ask for
10 13.
we lived
that's beautiful i don't see us winning
this though the fish is too strong
that's a level three fish that's that's
uh that's very spicy man that's that's a
good team
i honestly we just ran into a great
gamer i can't be mad
now
this is a combine
and a buy
and then i think it's a honestly like a
bye bye but we can roll one more time
just to see where we stand
and i definitely think you can dump this
to get a little slice of that
should freeze you just in case again
we want some garlic on our peacock next
time
phrasing but
you know what
we really want to draw at a minimum here
i don't mind seeing a level 2 dromedary
that's like it the meta situation is bad
for us the real situation is totally
fine
peacock you're doing lovely work
this is kind of what we're rooting for
now we don't want to invest too heavily
in the peacock because we're probably
going to pivot off of it later unless
maybe we get like a kangaroo or
something but
hasn't happened yet
puppy's not the right time it's not
it's not that late but it might be a
little too late i think this is a sell
freeze
roll
by freeze situation
freeze me
roll me
save me this is this is mighty nice
this boy is so
so clingy right now
okay level one bad don't hit my peacock
that's all i ask
lucky
big plays
oh these are big plays
these are some of the biggest plays
you're gonna see oh hello tomo um
would you like to
oh oh it's all coming down man
hey hey buddy you'll see a tail there
you go
hey what are you what are you doing up
there great job peacock i assume
this is huge man
huge
friend bot gain one gold hold on we know
you're getting sold
very nice
i guess we can roll this for now
there's a gold dude an eagle is kind of
sick but what do you get rid of to make
your eagle work
you peel the flamingo
that's what you do
and i guess you roll like an eagle at
the front for the time being
get a gold back roll me
freeze me
freeze me
we're in uh what i would describe as a
delicate position because i have a squad
that does well right now
i don't want to pivot off of this squad
but if i don't pivot off of this squad
we will likely
lose over time
this is unfortunate
my my god we lived
that that garlic armor did insane work
there um so like we're gonna need to
invest in making this better somehow i
but it's hard to see what you get rid of
first to make it happen right
i mean i guess i guess you buy another
goat
if we could get to the point
why not um
where uh a goat
is giving you
two gold for every friend that you buy
then you could start to think about you
know uh
running like a dragon chicken build can
i tell you i do not mind going up
against uh a team that has a snail that
that strikes me as a team that's
you know in economic despair right now
and that bodes well for my chances so i
think this is a little bit of a luck of
the draw by the way desolate housewives
i've been there
i've been down there
running a snail at the front because you
got nothing else to to fit there
they're there but for the grace of god
go eye
we have another can a rhino is always
interesting
i think we're gonna do a can investment
i'm just gonna i'm gonna go loco man
freeze me
freeze me
that's a nine nine man
that's that's crazy
um
you could probably talk about throwing a
turtle in that front position
but i mean the turtle does it really is
a good bat counter i would specifically
i i consider bats like
dangerous enough to warrant that now
this is a scary team the uncertain
pieces you piece
garlic armor is not doing much this is a
loss you just
we're running this is a guy who's well
on his way or a person who's well on
their way to like you know eight or nine
wins i'll settle for being fodder there
the only thing that annoys me is that
they don't know
like this is the meme of the guy at the
party they don't know that i'm not bad
they don't know because their team's so
good they don't know that i'm also good
so peacock's important but i think
the goat makes a little bit more sense
because on
oh
i thought it would work i thought it
would double the amount of gold we got
it just allows us to do it more often
um
i still think we kind of gotta try
i guess i'll run you pretty close to the
front
might as well give you some garlic um
and we're gonna start to
we're probably gonna sell our our swan
is my guess i know that seems busted but
something's got to give we
maybe we could sell the chick but it's a
it's a tight sell let's put it that way
big place
the plays remain large
i think we lose believe it or not just
cause the
the gorilla gets that coconut shield it
shoots in spurts and if it hits it's
gonna hurt by the way
so we're on our last life
that's bad
[Laughter]
obviously um
and we i'm so like concerned
we're gonna get stuck yet again
at this five win marty man for now we
can
like freeze i know we got a goat but
freeze it for a second because we're
trying to see if we got any tier ones
that's fine we buy it we sell it
seven gold roll me again
tier ones this is important you buy it
you get a beautiful buff you get some
gold in return you sell it
now i'm like we gotta i want to buy this
guy
we're at four gold roll freeze me
should have probably bought that first
we can roll one time
freeze me
look
i i do believe in our scaling
i think we might have found ourselves in
winner's bracket though a little too
early i don't know man it's a level
three it's going to become a 39-32
it's dangerous dude
even like peacock is not doing well with
that armor anyway this is a loss
i can't believe it we're stuck
yet again
at five wins
it's
slightly above average but hey thanks
for watching we'll try to get back to
some greatness next time i hope you
enjoyed it if you did click the like
button also the great deal of course
subscribe you want to see more in the
future thanks for watching i'll see you
next time see ya



we're back it's been like four days
since i played super auto pets
i'm eager to be playing
let's do it there have been some changes
by the way i feel like purge gaming i
feel like purge gaming there have been
some balance changes made to super auto
pets let me go over them right now okay
i don't know if they've actually been
pushed out yet
but it's gonna happen
here it comes okay
dodo
now only targets one minion so it
doesn't scale to two minions and then
three minions but it gains a damage
multiplier so instead of a dodo going
wide it can at least go deep on one unit
butterfly copies from the minion with
the most health end attack which i'm
assuming is like a uh
like it's a sum of of attack and uh
and health
bat is now a one two
there are two bat changes specifically
bat is a one two
and week has been changed to give three
extra damage instead of five so they
nerfed the bad stats which is fine like
one three versus one two doesn't change
too too much i think i mean they got the
data
weak giving three extra damage
actually makes like a big difference
because now your
one attack units can't kill a six health
unit just because it has a week applied
to it
was it a response to the tier list many
people are saying this
many people are saying this
now here we go we've already run the
casino
a beetle is acceptable a beaver is
freezable
by the way best change in the in the new
server patch um
the uh
the freeze button no longer
requires a ping to the server
now the most important part of the game
i'll be a flexible swimmer that's fine
by me
ripped to the microbe yeah they saw my
micro builds and they you know they just
said we can't have this we can't have
this
we lose this
this is a loss because they got an ant
club benedict i recognize the name hey
honestly there's no sweat you you run up
against an ant you lose that's just the
way the cookie crumbles um
imo this is a sell me
by me situation nice little 2-4 chilling
around here
um two crickets
we sleep
one pig
we don't sleep and usually here i like i
like to purchase
like
a thing
one second
and then buy some food
you peace
freeze me i forgot how much gold i had
still is a nasty a two four and two two
threes that's a nasty squad
mosquito doesn't scare me two level one
crickets i mean there's daddy don't get
me wrong they got stats not that scary
though
leveling on turn three is most important
oh frick we lose this one too you know
who you're talking to right you're
talking to the meta definer of super
auto pets i invented leveling on turn
three
just like george costanza invented it's
not you it's me
this is a no sweat situation for now
just thinking
maybe we shouldn't have combined
everything unfreeze me roll me
feel like um
still a bat is useful obviously
then i'm gonna be honest you're gonna be
like get that tier three it's a genius
idea
but instead we're actually just gonna
feed this freaking beetle at five hp it
can do some serious work
it can do some serious work
it's still one three not patched yet
look at that because we bought
that meat
we just two for one their tanky beetles
and yet we're still gonna lose
okay
now here we go okay we gotta we gotta
rattle off six wins before our next loss
i'm here to tell you it's not a problem
dromedary's got us stacked up here
already
ladybug gets sold in favor of the
peacock we don't have the resources to
to run this ants
with a pill
two three fish no thank you
pig
very important on the freeze there
dromedary not that important on the
freeze
this is a cella dromedary
by an ants
freeze a pill
roll me freeze me squeeze me this
believers we're not losing this round i
promise you that
we're not losing this round this is the
start
we still get a two for one trade right
off the get-go
turtle does not override weakness which
is nice for us
okay we're gonna
lose no we're gonna we're gonna draw
let's go
good good good
we're in there
okay this and now here we go now we're
starting okay you bat me might as well
do the frozen one
la mommy no thank you
we need to clear space in our shop
because we're about to get another one
poo doll me now we're talking
freeze me
pill me
poodle me
freeze me
roll me like this hey teal teemo
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you for the belief the implicit
belief in my abilities
early blowfish dies in one hit that's
what you like to see
it begins
first win
now we really want to get the scaling
going on our poodle which means we want
to get rid of
um our peacock
in favor of something more useful
interesting
and uh we probably do want to get rid of
our beetle pretty soon
now puppy is just like it's just scary
man it's it's it's only turn six i think
we can probably
i think we can probably make it function
sell me
juice me juice me
i'm gonna be honest for that it's a
weird play for the time being
i think you need a little bit of that
and then you're just gonna freeze me
there we go so now we got a 5-5 out
there
we can't lose
like i mean we can we literally just if
we lose the consequences are terrible on
the garlic let's
go this looks like a draw to me but i'll
take it with our scaling
good land on the weakness good land on
the weakness okay still going that
double caterpillar i'm glad i'm not
facing you later in the game let's just
put it that way
definitely want our poodle to get closer
freeze me a pair for a second
roll me again buy me a poodle
yes
unfreeze my pair
sell
you got to sell the beetle in this
situation
buy me a cow
two four three one five
oh baby
[Laughter]
i think you you you can stack it on the
bat
or you could stack it on the pig
i think the pig's going to scale okay i
think you start let me get let me get
started a little bat let me start a
little puppy as well even though they
got the scaling built in
um i'm look there's a part of me that's
like sell the cow so you get the scaling
um
on the puppy but i think you gotta you
gotta just
let it ride this time and we fed the
puppy some milk instead that's like a
reasonable trade
owns
you can question mark it all you want
here's your question mark
how many points are you gonna lose when
we bust out a six win streak
owned
llama bait good try
everybody makes mistakes you know now we
are going to sell you
donkey donkey donkey we know we want
this a deer is okay
and it would scale but it doesn't
benefit from scaling i think this is a
roll situation
we're unlikely to get to a tier 3 just
being honest that being said a bison
will
get
it's a six six and it will get plus two
plus two
no it won't because our poodle will get
plus two plus two
roll me once more
two four three one
roll me once more
roll me once more
little expensive on the rolls i don't
think anybody would disagree with that
this is a squeeze me
double roll me situation
turtle was we do have a tier three
but a turtle pill is worth holding i
think that was a bad turn basically
we were just fishing for something that
would
fit a little better we never got it
at least the rhino dies in one hit
that one goes out to all the people who
wanted to sell the pig
thanks for the free win
your owns
your owns
you're owned once more
two gold left tell me you don't own the
pay to win expansion pack without
telling me you don't own the pay to win
expansion pack now this is huge now
we're getting back in here
puppy creates a gorilla gorilla is nuts
you get combined
you get bought that's a gimme
now you got you we got to make sure that
you live
that's the scary thing you know you're
gonna freeze a poodle here
i think this is a double roll situation
you can sell pig get to six
roll once and buy one thing
i'm willing to roll once first just to
see where we stand on that
cell pig
it's not the right time it's not you
freeze roll me once and freeze me this
is this is a good freeze this is a hold
the pig i'm just not
i don't believe that the gorilla is
going
to live through the first attack we got
lucky it actually did
we need we need a melon armor on it as
soon as possible dude i'm loving
that coconut shield
his coconut gun shoots in spurts
level two bus is a little nasty but the
puppy runs you
it's a bit spooky on the on the bat here
it's not that spooky
this is a draw
at worst
and we're getting stronger every time
three wins okay here you go
you you absolute even at the cost of our
puppy not getting scaling this time
it must be done
this is the easiest freeze of my life
octopus we've talked about it before
it's not quite there yet
now a bison
instead of a gorilla
is an interesting idea
i think the gorilla can function if
anything i think we're looking for
a tier 5 unit
that we want to scale
the bison will scale but a tier 5 unit
could sail it could scale better
um you getting what plus four plus four
so you're getting plus six plus six okay
i i buy this i buy this it sells for
four
we buy the bison
we roll one time
yeah i believe in this
but oh he doesn't get the buff because
the gorilla gets the buff instead but
that's okay
we got
two 39 43 puppies
three i mean
[Laughter]
with no like augmented garlic armor
that seems like a heavy rip to me wait
the caterpillar is only level one
how did that happen
level one total though
is still a loss
overrides the weakness that's a strong
team
well dude that honestly if we didn't get
stopped at three there
i think we were going like seven or
eight we had such good scaling
had nothing to do with selling the pig
for the bison it's just we ran into a
a nasty team there
just happening we got an injury at a bad
time and it all it all fell apart
okay this we don't get early losses here
when we have an ants it's that simple
you peace
um
that's that's what i meant give me
i'll be the uh i i know i'm gonna be the
miffed kilts though that sounds like a
band you could hear at a fake irish pub
i'm not gonna be the loose housewives
that's that's low-hanging fruit
i'm not gonna be the broken housewives
that's just troubling
this seems like a loss to me
no it seems like a draw because of the
ant
no it seems like a loss
[Laughter]
okay it's just that honestly we ran into
like a bad shop it was just a terrible
like shop although we did have an ant
early which is nice
we're gonna have a pig join the party
we're gonna get a second mosquito we're
gonna roll one time
we're gonna put an apple on the unit
most likely to stick around which is our
pig
then we're going to put our pig at the
back so it's guaranteed to get the ant
buff
kilts are scottish yeah and most of the
people who run irish pubs here are like
you know americans so it's not they
don't make you take a dna test i think
before you
force your serving staff to wear like
tartan and and sell nine dollar pints of
guinness
now this is actually a win
why will pigs stick around
um i
look it's a good cell i would rather
have a fish but now i'm like is slightly
late um
i think i like having one
unit that soaks stats early i don't
necessarily like it being the mosquitoes
i think it looks like this like i think
it's good to have like one
six six seven seven eight eight unit
even if it is a level one you can sell
it back whenever you want to sell it
back too it's not like you you get a
bonus for selling it back early
give me one of these
pill me takes me to
nine
that's
not what i wanted to see
roll
me actually you know what flamingo me
fish me
cupcake
me
i don't want to get big losses early we
want big wins
excuse me your shrimp actually lived
through
an attack
i don't buy it
that's a strong team all right well the
cupcake was a bit of a waste
w-a-a-i-s-t
am i gonna do it i think i'm gonna do it
man
give me one of these
y-w-a-i-s-t
somebody's name
that i shall not uh repeat said yeah
just waste money spelled like uh this
the thing you wear uh your jeans around
good strategy and then i trunked them
and now we're making fun of them
because it feels nice um okay we're
gonna do it give me give me the shrimp
and then we're in full on like buy me
sell me mode
when full-on like swan me
full-on roll me
full-on
sell me
double swan me
i think we might go down here by the way
like
i genuinely would not be surprised to be
at one life after this but we'll see
very similar squad i can't help but
notice
at least we trade here
i mean i don't see how you're coming
through out of this one
okay but this is where we hit the the
gear starts to pog
it's it's just that simple it's an early
caterpillar but not early enough hey
just like a thought like you know what
would be sick is like imagine if we
could create
like a level two unit this is just like
hypothetical or whatever
um
i'm gonna say this is a buy me so we can
combine the stats
maybe that doesn't make a difference now
that i think about it but it's it's a
big buy me sell me as we know
didn't see this one coming so check this
out
sell me
we have to win this round
i'm going in deep
that's so bad
oh this that's terrible man um
and yet
oh
where is it or is it
okay
i know we're not rolling a full squad i
i was banking on my level four unit to
uh be a little bit better than this but
we do we got some stats out here all we
need to do is draw man all we need to do
is drop
that looks like uh that looks like a
draw to me actually it looks like a win
to me i don't believe it
okay look at that two wins
i mean you know we're rolling
i mean just to be straight up with you
um there's a big part of me that's like
sell this guy right here stack me up
baby
[Laughter]
okay hold on
this is this is dumb but great
well that's not worth too much you know
what is a great sell me opportunity
though
to buy me sell me
there we go 613
you have to buy this is the easiest buy
of my life
please no bats
we have an 11 18 swan up at the front
no bats no bad i see a two oh i see a
lot of meats but this doesn't seem that
bad
this doesn't seem that bad
level three shrimp is one of the rarest
achievements
why are people so sleepy on the shrimp
man like it's
it's kind of sick
that's another win for us right there
the shrimp has some plays man i wouldn't
expect you to understand honestly the
chick is kind of good i think this is
like
necessary
i mean i i have to be honest with you
i think you sell the bison
we need to keep you you're kind of like
a bison you have one one yourself and
you pass five five to something with
garlic armor then
you buy an owl
you sell an owl
you get some beautiful stats added up
there
you can laugh all you all you
want okay
you can laugh as hard as you want
shrimp garlic
we're making a scampi
[Laughter]
this is the way
this is the way
oh no i have garlic your scorpion can't
hit through garlic
that beautiful weakness though thank god
hey mcfly those things don't work on
water that's a win baby
scampi meta
we got more bisons we don't care for
them we don't care for them honestly
what we do care for is a big
sell me
roll me
why
because if you don't sell it what's the
point in having the shrimp
you don't you're not thinking creatively
you need to think like emerald lagasse
if you want this run to work okay
you're flat we look at pigs would be
nice or anything that gives us a value
on cell
would be good
so i i don't respect these
i do respect this
i do respect this
you peace him me him him me
um
that's a freeze just in case
i know i'm a doctor too
feel like it's most valuable
this whoever we run into is gonna be
like what the hell did you what did you
do
they're gonna be like what on earth did
you do to create this squad man
you gotta go here i don't even know
where you put the rhino man it's it's so
weird
i don't know
freeze me just in case you're runnable
for sure 13 25 swan
okay
i mean this looks possible
it's a draw
but that's okay
that's very okay because we're only on
four units which is like uh
usually kind of the kiss of death
now i think bat
plus rhino at the front
is how you maybe start to get this off
the ground
hoping that the bat weakens an enemy
in that case though you should
freeze the bed
yeah this makes sense
please me
look i'm not i'm not a full believer
i'm not a full believer but
i feel like maybe we shrimped ourselves
out here
this is this is not great
because of that
but that's okay
this this blowfish is gonna go off a
little
that's what i was worried about but i
think we're still in a good spot none of
the other units really slap a little bit
don't talk about scampi build
shrimp wins
okay so
i do think we're we are buy selling
which means the chick has to go even
though it is amazing for the rhino the i
mean we could sell a swamp but the stats
are too good so you're gonna
buy an owl
you're gonna sell an owl buff my rhino
you piece thank you
we're looking for bibles
and sellables
this this only functions when we here's
my problem with the chicken okay what do
we sell
in order to keep the chicken in the
squad because we only have its effect
while it's active
i don't think there is anything you can
do
i think it's i think it's garbage here
you roll me
buy me roll me
i'm just gonna level with you you're not
gonna like this one
buy me
eat me eat me
sell me for the buff and the extra hp
and then we're going to continue to roll
with a squad that's understated it's
under manned
you anytime you see four units you know
you're in trouble but
or do you or do you
that could be worse it didn't hit our
swan the melon armor is quite nasty or
is it
or is it
the scampi build has paid out the
believers even though we lost three
early on i don't believe it
the four-man win
i mean this is easy mode man this is a
by me
followed by a selmy
dull baby
definitely a freeze me
you kind of don't need a swan
you need like
although it is nice to have that buying
space i don't know why i did it like
that
i i see
this is a buy sell but we don't want to
do it instead we're going to roll two
t-rex's for now
we're going to combine them and give
them some chocolate next time
i'm almost like
i thought about saving a turtle but
big place we need we need melon on our
rhino one way or the other
that's what you don't want to see
it's a leopard
uh
a leopard uh
50 20 dog to start with hey but you know
what
pay out the
believers the scampi build got the job
done
that's you you can't be mad about that
good hustle to to get ourselves out of a
a bit of a jam there run me back one
more
time
oh this is that's money dude look at
that
oh my god my oh my freeze me squeeze me
this is
i mean we got to be the naughty turtles
here this is a a very very strong round
one imagine what our life would look
like if we won the first round instead
of losing it we win this even if our
ants had no buffs attached
that's how strong that is
now if we can get something that scales
early
roll me
don't even need to freeze honestly just
give me uh just give me the bees instead
also made the shop units better for no
reason but
very interesting setup you got here
i don't see this being any worse than a
draw
with with our b at the back that's
beautiful
that's amazing
it's a draw it's not a draw sorry we get
the
we get the b spawn we win again look at
that
why you have no turtles i'm only on tier
one units i gotta we gotta go a step
further here first
so dog builds are a little bit of a
resident snooze
but that being said
while we're here
i suppose i can be persuaded
fish me
freeze me
and me
i respect this
i'm not a sell me by me sort of guy i'm
a i'm a roll me
freeze me
no because we need space for our shop to
grow okay don't freeze the ant that's
fine no you're good you're good you're
good this is good
don't freeze me you're good okay we're
up 2-0 a draw would be fine a draw would
be a-okay
but a win would be sweeter i do see a
tier 3 unit but it's a spider a spider
is a sleeper
that that does stink but it hit a nice
unit
five five fish at the back no ants
buffing you sucks to be you i know it's
true we trade with the spider
we trade with the mosquito and then we
win
via our incredible fish that's three
wins already
kill me
no problem
buy me
combine me
by me
combine me
exist
[Laughter]
the final step is merely existence on
that one but that's okay
sadly not a camel that's that's merely a
dromedary a slightly different situation
still useful four seven rat
hmm stats are good on that rad
i'm hoping that it still allows you
peace i don't get to spawn a b because
of my freaking rat dude it's not even my
rat she doesn't she isn't even supposed
to go here
this still looks pretty good to me
don't buff the rat holy crap
all right it's a draw no wait we win
because it's our red right
thanks for the free points
okay now this now we're talking man
the ant has to go
i would love to get rid of it for a buff
but it's got to go
then you do this
summon me
become me
become
wrath
sell me
we already have four wins dude this is
crazy
[Laughter]
i think now you have uh
an easy step this is gonna well this is
gonna be the next thing to go probably
this is a
chick me garlic me
and this dog is quite spicy early on
here
a 4-4 well you overkill our deer like a
son of a gun there's just some bad news
following that which is i kill your four
or five fish without it doing anything
oops
we do we trade with the turtle which is
totally fine we ruin your melon armor
with a 1-1 b ooh tough luck
and then you got a rat at the back
thanks for the squad
we come over we got free soda we got
free pizza come on over yeah you don't
have to be on that stinky team anymore
don't
freaking talk to me
sell me
scampi me
sell me
buy me
sell me
freeze me roll me
no no no no roll me
buy me
sell me
roll me
sheep me
until i can get my set
not my dog not my dog
hello tomo
he didn't hit my dog let's go okay
uh my sheep
sorry we only got one ram out of it it's
that's the way the cookie crumbles
sometimes you're a piece quite frankly
whatever you're dead how are you how you
gonna punch through this dog man how are
you gonna punch through this dog
can't be done thanks for the win
bro that's six pay out the believers
oh
feels good man
anyway um excuse me
you want to see something funny pill me
sell me
[Laughter]
jesus christ
hold on tomo is tomorrow
tomorrow
you can't be in the chords man
we need to get a squad that scales
further okay so like a spider we can buy
knowing we're likely to sell it later
but it does make the dog better no
matter what
the i mean a buffalo
honestly just fits
because we're
excuse me tomo not in the chords my man
yeah
there you go
you can you can roll a buffalo here it
will mean you're getting rid of like
your your sheep and your deer probably
but
sell me
buy me
likely sell me but just wait one moment
please
[Laughter]
freeze me um
sell me
following that i'm gonna i'm gonna get
you to do a little
there's gonna be some buying and selling
so get ready okay this is a buy i know
you're like why the shrimp instead of
the dog
it's cause you're look you're all about
the you're all about the buys but you
haven't thought about the damn cells yet
okay
this round might be not the best but
this is the necessary regression you
take to get all-you-can-eat shrimp
scampi at red lobster
tomorrow this is getting a little much
okay
it's getting to be a little much
my family's starting to worry about me
this this one's a loss trojan waffle but
um
they got the golden poop headset what
can you say they got a 23-23 ladybug
that's a gamer you know what's up you
know what's up i know what's up you know
what's up that's a sell me
uh
buy me
combine me
buy me
sell me
roll me
buy me
sell me
him him me him me
i'm thinking the bad is the best unit
but this is more fun
buy a pill freeze the spider kill the
spider
get the proc for it being summoned sell
the thing that it creates
we got to combine our shrimp and get one
more good unit out there too
i watch nl for the banter cue it up buy
me sell me ice me freeze me you peace
i mean i i don't see you punching
through the dog too much here so i'm not
sweating it
i think our shrimps are gonna live long
enough to get us the win here
oh baby
that's seven
hello point crow hello
i saw you on twitter
uh
liking the thirst traps that say one
like equals like one head pat and asking
about your day
by what appeared to be a nice young lady
wearing a
like a spandex onesie hey man look don't
let anybody
tell you what you can't do online okay
i'm gonna level with you
i was good i was gonna sell this
caterpillar okay
i kind of feel like i might keep it
be a nice
additional dog
we can always combine these sons of guns
there's no by me selmies here
eagle you know what we can at least put
an eagle out here
it is late i'm not gonna deny the
lateness
i i get it
that you would like but then again what
do we sell in order to make the goat
actually work there's nothing to fit it
there's no fits
i mean straight up i'm like chilly she's
like
i'm telling you
the chick actually benefits us
more than the eagle imo that's the
that's the freeze of the century right
there
that's the second that's this is the
this is the greatest shop you're ever
gonna see in your life i don't even know
if we're gonna have enough money to do
all the things i want to do here
we have to scale
the
caterpillar with experience
faster than we have to level anything
else up
that's for certain nice shrimp nice
shrimp oh a fellow man of taste
ray a golden ray of sun
shrimp a scampi on my plate
prawns a shrimp that's slightly large
and it brings us back to
my cocktail sauce the shrimp a shrimp
shrimp me
you're not a shrimp
are you crazy okay i mean this had to be
done
you can you can function here a little
longer i i like where you're at okay
i like that we can keep the cow out
there a little longer let's let's level
the shrimp up
screw you
you're a piece roll me
might save this for the dog but
we still got the cow for later this is
good this is good man this is good don't
even worry about it
level one turtle i sleep i think
24 24 at the back that's a little nasty
but i'm telling you you only go oh okay
we're probably going to lose this one
we're definitely gonna lose this one but
once our caterpillar pops
we just then
maybe that's where we sell a shrimp to
get a turtle in front of our caterpillar
and then win the game
oh baby
so we can lose our next one and it's
okay that's a sell me
by me
might as well stack the unit that is
the strongest
sell me
buy me fish for a caterpillar
sell me
buy me
freeze me just in case
roll me caterpillar
it's kind of like a caterpillar man
sell me
buy me
max hp me
would you this would be an amazing draw
a draw would do fine here
22 22 is not that scary
we don't live through that just barely
that's that's pain man that's pain
so this is a loss just barely man
but
now we have this that's big that's big
now
sell me
sell me throw it though it pains me
you're gonna sell me
gorilla is a little late
i don't know what the heck we're looking
for
maybe a melon armor a turtle
a turtle would fit
i mean as long as we're buying and
selling i'm a happy man
oh baby
snail me
roll me
so it's not great but you can roll a
deer
and the purpose of it is essentially
melon armor
or not removing melon armor from our
opponents you sell a shrimp scampi
in order to roll a level one turtle in
front of this
very necessary part of the build
that's a double freeze if i've ever seen
one
send me here we go here we go
the caterpillar has a chance remember
this was a big we killed the spider we
got a beautiful caterpillar which we're
hoping turns into a beautiful butterfly
i love that you're wasting
your
steak on a unit that it does not matter
for
it's spiced here it's a bit spiced
get get cracked
get cracked oops my melon armor
nine wins baby we win these
now we have no need for the dog to get
leveled 34 damage is almost certainly
enough
heavy roll me
i've got to remember this is not a buy
sell situation
octopus is a
little late
you know i
garlic's not that good anymore but this
is still the better play in my opinion
now t-rex has some interesting ideas
associated with it but it's it's all or
nothing right now i would rather have a
a level one deer than a t-rex that won't
get a
scaling on this turn
if we draw i would i would stand by that
i think it's it's too late for the
scaling to pop
if anything i'd rather have like an ant
as as busted as that sounds give me a
stake if we draw we want steak on deer
10 12 level 2 turtle
it's a spicy team
the weakness being applied at the start
very bad for business
but
we're gonna get
oh you got your own watermelon armor
this is probably a loss
you peace we were so close
we were so close
still nine wins on a scampi build that's
really good
that's not that's not an f there's no
there's no cause for alarm on that one
that's that's a great win
we'll throw a slash marker in here
sap one



then we're gonna roll it back
start prediction will we get six wins or
more
put me we you know we've been doing some
pay to win put me on some uh oh i was
gonna say put me on some free to play
then i saw a shop that had two ants and
i said nope we will stick with this
because that's very strong
um
i like the idea of a hooting biker
sulking biker is like bikers are already
sulking isn't that like why they're out
on the open road
they're like nobody understands me
and the only way i can express myself is
by using my incredibly loud motorcycle
to
wake people up in a residential
neighborhood at 5 00 a.m
i'd rather if it wouldn't be so bad for
me
if they uh
you know drove around and they were
going whoo sheesh
but the fact that they just drive around
going
i'm like okay i get it you know
you've got a leased motorcycle like
congrats
so
it's nowhere to go but down from there
sheesh
i mean i think you buy this is a just in
case
type buy
a beetle is a is a worthy freeze
a double beetle is is an acceptable play
there's nothing wrong with that
motorcycles are loud so people in cars
can hear them
uh source dude with a modified
harley-davidson motorcycle with a bumper
sticker on the side that says loud pipes
save lives who drives uh down my street
10 times at 4 30 a.m and he's the only
traffic on the street at the moment
it's for safety brother
i wouldn't expect a non-rider to
understand
oops i won
if you had like a silencer you could put
on that at like after 11 pm that
wouldn't be so bad
if you couldn't you just put like a two
liter bottle on the on the end of it
to catch the noise
wrap a bunch of towels around it or
something
um okay
look we look we have a scampi build okay
but we don't have a scampi build we got
a scampi build but we don't have a
scampi build i think you freeze a dog
fish for your level twos come on man
there we go okay so this is the dream
combine me
buy me i'm taking a risk here
buy me
you needed you needed to summon that
man sell me
this is good
squeeze me
freeze me
that could have been better but this is
this is still a good build here this is
a strong build
four six trades with a five seven you
love to see it
we don't do too much trading after that
this is a loss those are some high stat
units
unless
the swan just dies
i mean that's a strong team
you can't be too upset
pill me
acceptable
i'm a
anybody else
god i should call her her in this case
is shrimp scampi
we want a dog at the back now
something like that
um
we wanted you know it is a situation
where honestly you just want to invest
in a unit that's likely to stick around
i apologize for running two dog builds
skipped early camel it's not a camel
it's a dromedary okay
it's two different things
this is uh
this is a tie
due to a beetle or due to a bee no it's
a it's a tie due to the bee lango trio i
recognize you i recognize you
they they want me to roll shrimp scampi
man
they're praying for me to roll shrimp
scampi
nobody wants you to do it okay fine i'll
do it sell me
buy
me
sell me
buy me
combine me
buy me
freeze me
juice me
now we're talking
is a roll of juice there's
a spectrum
rolls juices
freezes squeezes
per chances parties
believes and then
sadly occasionally you do end up being
bereaved from time to time
this is a draw
a merciful draw but a draw nonetheless
i just watched your tier list you're in
this like a league player i have no idea
what's happening but i love it that's
the spirit of auto pets baby that's
where we're
at i got in early enough that i feel
like i can be
good hey old man cyan
thanks for the five gifted subs one for
each sell me juice me
freeze me squeeze me thank you
we bought in early
i missed bitcoin
i missed amazon
i missed the monster energy drink on the
new york stock exchange but i can still
catch super auto pets man i can still k
it's not too late copium
you missed out on the iphone it's true i
didn't miss out on the iphone i suppose
well i i just i didn't believe that the
iphone could make it i didn't think it
could
i didn't see a future in the iphone
personally
ended up not being a great uh
prediction for me but i was also like 19
years old
i think i'm i'm gonna fish here
look
we only have one win that's actually
pretty bad
you have my word next round
we're selling
the fish and then we're selling shrimp
scampi we need to get a little bit we
need to win some rounds quite frankly
and we're not doing that
right now please tell me i lived through
the hatching chick long enough to kill
the bird thank god
never mind i didn't know what i was
talking about
[Laughter]
okay two losses this is bad but it's
okay
sell me
this is a rare exception this is a by me
sell me
you peace
then it's just to sell me sell me now
it's probably a can me
and i think you actually do really well
with like a rooster
now
that got it got a nice buff on it
now you could freeze a sheep
if you don't get anything better
i
i think that's probably where we want to
stay for now
this can work the the rooster is a is a
very very strong unit
insider doubting
rooster in front of dog does make sense
i have a bias towards putting like a
unit that spawns units at the back just
because i'm like this will trick them
i think it makes no difference
whatsoever
actually let me rephrase i think it
makes a difference i think it makes uh
it's worse
either way
look at that
so we're two wins two losses
starting to believe in the in the power
of our scaling here
this is fine
roll me
by me this is temporary cost for
permanent gain you got to go
in favor of an eagle
i'm going to just go ahead and say
we're probably going to can
so let's freeze it i mean buy it
freeze it
don't freeze it roll me
buy me next turn
that's good stuff man that's good stuff
the dog is hard to scale if we're
attached to all our units so we we gotta
recognize that the sheep is probably
gonna go it's not long for this world
bat don't hit my dog you're a piece you
already knew that
level one dragon hey man i'm not going
to complain the stats or the stats are
good look at that
now i don't know if we do better than a
draw oh we definitely do
we definitely do
i won my first latest fire build today i
couldn't imagine what a 20s like so i i
did really well if i may say so myself
a20
watcher took us a bit right
but we got there
then i did a 20 ironclad for the second
time like from zero to 20 on my switch
and it went well
had some had some losses had some wins
then
i've been trying to do it on the silent
i like i can't even get over
uh
a10 like i keep dying
on a10 over and over
dude that's not bad
about 20 wins i hope well yeah
it's probably like 70 rounds but
now i have done it with the silent i
think the silent was the last character
we did it for the first time we uh
we made it through all the ascensions
and and the only time we'll ever make it
through all the ascensions you peace but
we we one shot the gorilla then we trade
with the poodle baby
yummy the dog goes down we ice the skunk
here no sweat
dog gets the kill you love to see it
chick can also buff rooster that's a
great idea
that is a great idea
level three chick is kind of interesting
because i think the plus two plus two is
really nice the experience is great and
then i guess you scale you sell them
later you don't scale them that would be
ridiculous
um let's do this then let's let's try at
least we get stats and you're right i
don't mind mixing it up a little bit
we do want to one-up on you
i think we can instead roll a chili
pepper on you
like you're a hot computer science
professor on ratemyprof.com
now
that's true experience does give plus
one plus one
this is not a buy me sell me anymore
it's a little late for the caterpillar
rhino 1112 rhino
discuss do it honestly
now i'm like buy me sell me
no
11 12 rhino can can function
at that price he can hit you know what
while we're up here why don't you can me
man
i don't know if there is a turkey in the
in the pay to win build
nl skunk is really good source dude just
trust me
this is a horrible team i'm i'm like
horrible for us
it's really bad
we don't even kill the puppy because
it's gonna live via garlic armor but we
might draw
on the strength of our incredible dog
in fact we're actually gonna win
[Laughter]
oh
man
can me if as long as you're winning
we're canning okay
roll me
go ahead and hit me up with a uh with a
melon rhino for now
i'll just treat this as like a defensive
cupcake for now if it if we get a one-up
no we don't want a one-up
melon rhino i think is okay at least
allows us to hit twice on this insane
peacock
that's this is a loss and a half man
congratulations mike ambrose
on your on your victory more power to
you
the only way we punch through this is
the rooster keeps getting buffed and
then
we get a uh
we level it up if we level up the
rooster
we can beat a team like this in the
future
okay
this is this is very important now
rolney
it's not a can-me situation
temporarily we can do this this one's
for the believers we need something like
this
dude i'm going to be honest as much as i
like the melon armor
i kind of feel like you put it on the
rhino to try to kill a unit right now
you know what you know what i like
chat's opinion
try it like that
there's big
big plays if we win this one
please weak white weenie style builds
level two turtle obviously counters what
we got going on but we still have a
tanky squad i'm not like
i'm not insanely upset with what we got
going on here
i would not describe myself as thrilled
i'm not insanely upset
you peace
that's a draw baby
[Laughter]
okay now
it's like i do want to level you uh
this will now by doing that we will
create two chickens because it applies
at the end of this turn
roll me
honestly roll me buff me
excuse me excuse me
it doesn't start it says end the turn oh
it started turn it changed
and i rolled past the rooster
rip my points
well no rip uh rip your points
my points are safe and secure
we
we still would have lost against this
squad
just running it forward
you know one extra chick with like 15
attack punches the melon armor we still
lose but
obviously it leaves a bad taste in your
mouth
and we run it back will anal get six
wins or more
should have gone back to the free to
play this you know what i see i see a a
bad
shop i say whoops let's go back
excuse me
that's a great shop we're going to
abandon that take take me back to free
to play please
as the developer of the game i
will implement a change soon to make it
so that um when you hit play arena it
asks you which one you want to play
first oh baby whoa would you look at
this
i believe in the power of ducks
maybe a gushing bell tower
and first
that's where you're wrong
i i i place an ant
so that it deal okay well you know what
we're going to draw i place an ant so it
deliberately targets my strongest unit
whenever possible
i don't know if it if it actually
changes things that much but
it feels nice for me
there's plays to be made here okay it
looks like this
it looks like this
you roll me
you chill you chill me
we put you here
next turn we're hoping for a fish to
show up in the shop okay we buy the fish
come combine
sell both ducks all of a sudden we've
got a tier three unit on round three
that might be like a six six
all we need to see is a fish in our shop
this is pretty bad
this is not great
but you know what now that i look at it
i think we draw thanks to our bee doing
one damage fish in the shop please fish
in the shop
i'm rolling
okay it makes the it's still insanely
good for dodo
i know you're like what about what about
the shrimp
[Laughter]
hold the front door okay hold the hole
the front door
buy me
sell me
buff me
freeze me
because what if we got another duck
sell me
roll me
roll me
by me
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah rad
is op early game it's so it's one of the
easiest ways to uh it's one of the most
op ways to uh
give your opponent a free victory i
would tend to agree with you
you peace
melon armor piece
i see you also have a strong dodo what's
up with that
i ain't scared
okay okay you got me your dodo is better
than mine but don't care didn't ask plus
you're a guest
roll me pill me
be smart combine me
kill me
buy me
buy me
sell me
oh no he's doing it oh no oh no
collusion no collusion
no collusion
please we need a dub here we need a dub
here
four seven this looks okay i don't see
any level twos
our our seven piece so it's not gonna
live as well you know what it'll live
long enough to do one of those
then it'll kill the turtle you're a
spider don't care didn't ask plus you're
a spider
level two cricket like i said no level
twos that matter
ox that has no benefit associated with
it gets smoked we win
we
win scampi build
me
buy me
not good enough not good enough
it's not good enough
an ox is very interesting though like a
combine me
place
me roll me
by me i mean your base you're like i'm
you're a you're a mammoth right now
you're like an early mammoth
it's kind of weird
probably should move it so it's not
there huh
that's a good point i don't know where
to put it though
that shrimp is gonna eat it though
when our dodo hits level two which is
inevitable
um then then life will be a little bit
easier for us
okay
this is a win man
guaranteed
look at this
sick sick shrimp
eat
it okay this is the dream now it's that
simple
so
you buy me
we still probably want a dodo the whale
is going to eat the flamingo
i think you're getting sold i'm sorry to
tell you
and then you're probably getting sold
this still looks right
you piece
sell shrimp you peace
it actually is the next to go i just
don't have anything i love replacing it
with right now
you're literally insane enjoy an insane
victory
oh crap 11 12 badger
they're going full on badger bill
this seems okay because i have melon
armor
temporarily
okay
dodo is your time to shine oh frick
that's a that's a new meta front badger
man with a monkey buff
what are we at
that's that's one loss
two losses i clicked through a little
quick there um
okay okay this is a can me
sell me
kangaroo me the problem is now the ox
has very limited reason to exist even if
we do buff it i guess if the kangaroo
gets some buffs there could be a benefit
associated there
this doesn't matter too much i would
freeze me
roll freeze me
roll me
dude you gotta try
roll me
freeze me
easy incoming win
level one turtle i sleep
oh crap never mind i don't sleep i
forgot we eat our flamingo and then spit
it out with worse stats that's okay
kangaroos popping man look at this
nice level one melon armor
oh wait no it isn't is sorry it's you're
probably a viewer
don't care didn't ask plus my dodo lives
don't care didn't ask
my kangaroo beats your kangaroo
well this is bad
although
it's actually a draw okay
it's okay one of these that's big roll
me
it's it's just sadly not the right build
but it is only turn eight you know what
the time has come for a legendary pivot
come on
that's a that's an easy buy for future
purposes
that's an easy buy
so
the dodo's not part of our build anymore
we gotta we gotta start to unwind our
existing deck
we love the the the spam here though
like look at look at that stat spam man
this crazy town you're a 7-1 you're a
9-1
nice buff
there are flamingo's coming back out
it's a 6'4 your cricket eats it you love
to see it you love to see it
bunch of bees
not sweating
not sweating okay admittedly i start to
sweat this slightly just because it's
annoying
you got me on that one congrats
we actually lose this one by one hp
instead of a draw
you hate to see it okay
your boy jay you you put me on lethal
here
i can't believe it i was talking kind of
a big game there
the can must be purchased
the dodo must be killed
a rooster
will get played
in front of the whale
for now
just for now
you don't need garlic on you that's for
certain
roll me
freeze me
roll me
i like this game's
supposition
let's go that a sushi is actually just a
strictly better salad
deer
this ain't a deer build man
get ready
nice four four wow that's pretty spicy
uh too bad it loses to my 14 four it's
not as much as i thought shark scares me
a little okay
look it get owned
continue to get owns i spit out another
chicken that's that turtle's pretty bad
for me i'm not gonna deny that okay but
we do live through that which means we
do get to land and attack nicely here
chicken comes out kills the cricket you
love to see it you summon a two-two that
we're gonna lose to this shark man
there's no way we we make it through
this shark are you kidding me
it's not it's not sensible
we got three more units coming out here
it can't be done
every unit that faints just makes him
that much stronger
we're doing 21 damage hold on we might
draw
this one goes out to saucer king 11 who
says thanks for the points believers
the draw has happened
now we got to rethink our positioning
it's all screwed up uh-huh
you gotta sell the flamingo
i'm not even looking to chat cause i
know they're gonna crap their pants over
that one
which is very fair
a shark has to come out okay hold on
you're probably gonna sell a kangaroo
too you just gotta think about it the
shark must exist
this has to happen
you're gonna sell me
freeze me
exclusively
for the time being you're going to sell
me
you're going to go here
or
are you gonna no i i like this i like
this
though this would create two chicks
that would be
nineteen seven
or get plus four plus two on each death
with no garlic
what can you say
best of luck
i just want you to know
we're all counting on you
great start great start
still a great start
we knew that was coming we don't sweat
that oh a bee so scary
just kidding owned
owned
owned you're gonna own me for a little
bit here but hey this might be a draw
no it's an easy win
[Laughter]
never mind
okay where the heck are we gonna put you
here
never should have sold whale tell me you
averaged two wins
without telling me you averaged two wins
let me let me here's your squad
hedgehog at the back with a b on him
they'll never see that one coming
following that
i'm gonna guess you probably got like a
six six fish
right after that you got a peacock
that's a one six then you've got a whale
then you've got a deer and you're like
it's incredible because the deer gets
killed by the whale then it spits out a
fire oh but the five five um
bus just got one tapped and it did like
a quarter of the damage to two units but
then then the whale did two damage and
then it got one tap but then spit out
the deer that did one
damage
which is pretty much negligible but then
it spit out another five five bus and
that finally got the first unit killed
and then their third unit just runs over
you
um
and then you go it's probably pay to win
then you buy the expansion pack you
start running into bats bats bats bats
bats bats bats and then you're like
it's the ballot we need a balance patch
immediately
okay hold on
roll me
do not wail me don't even talk to me
about the parrot
is the sleeper of the century this is
necessary
this is necessary
this is necessary
i rerolled the fly
i choose not to let that information
into my brain
although the only thing i would say is
oh here we go here we go if we didn't
reroll the fly where do we put it like
what do we get we get rid of the hippo
obviously but how do we
how do we put our units in order to make
that actually function properly
you piece
get rid of shark
uh
how about nose scott
like they have a horse
we have a tiger
right now is not necessarily working out
that i think we win this man for all the
people who are like this is a loss
um wait i forgot that all of these units
will also summon incredibly strong flies
no this is definitely a loss i don't
know what i was thinking
every creature that comes out also
summons like a nine nine fly afterwards
all right relax so nice meta build
you pay out the doubters on that one you
got me you got me
dude i keep losing all my points
believing this sucks
i just paid out the believers
two games in a row
like 20 minutes ago doesn't make any
sense
i'm just you can be mad that you suck at
betting but
yeah but i doubt it then
then the first sentence was a lie
yeah but i bet i believed then and
doubled up but then i went all in on
belief and i lost if you go all in
you only need one loss to lose
everything
that's why you you need bankroll
management
okay hold on slash marker
sap two
donkey



chunky Chip have you played this yet
there's still time okay I know you're
you're looking at it and you're looking
at the graph and you're like it's too
late for me to get on the rocket ship
nah man it's still early
I asked my chat if I should play it and
they called me stupid
that doesn't sound like your Chad that
sounds like much
hold on hold on
it doesn't sound like you're a chat chip
I'm just going to be honest I think you
have out of all these units though I
hate them I think you have to roll horse
which is kind of like
an order problem but so be it
I mean you got to be the squeaky pieces
right
I think this is a I would say this is a
round one likely loss unless we run into
a fellow cursed player
this this actually could be totally fine
duck and pig are both like uh you know
those are future proof
we actually win holy crap
a friend of mine told me today that
you're bad at this game is that true NL
I didn't know that uh
Middle School cafeterias were open
during covid
was this like a zoom luncheon or
something
I thought I thought they had all you
guys like eaten at your desks in the
classrooms
two meters supposedly two meters away
actually more like you know 55
centimeters
okay hold on you can roll
I love a fish okay
I think this is not a fish play though
simply because we already have a horse
I think you can freeze a fish
temporarily roll once
fish for something that would level up
if you don't get it then it's very
simple you just put a b attached to that
ant
in order to get some six summons
well we trade with the fish they also
got a they've got the same build but
better this is probably a loss
if I had the guess this is a loss
if I had to guess this is a draw
hey oh
now
hey the bee took us from A Loss to a
draw I'm never going to insult it
we really we got some okay so I'm
guess get sold
get bought
get Frozen
get unfrozen
get Frozen you know what actually check
this out
um poggy
then we can sell it back later
also known as buy me sell me meta
get Frozen don't you mean freeze me oh
yeah yeah
sorry I meant to say freeze me
honestly
sell me
buy me
even without a scampi I'm a Believer in
The Meta
you're a piece on just straight up
you're a piece
take it or leave it
there's nothing wrong with being a piece
if you're like if you're okay with that
then give me one of those give me one of
these uh no don't give me one of those
don't give me one of these okay
yeah I don't know what happens if you
level up a bee I guess it would be so
hard to even get it to level two because
you'd have to put honey on something
kill it with a pill and then combine it
two times but I suppose it's a
theoretical possibility
foreign
this is a loss we knew this was coming
though this is like the necessary step
but because we didn't get a tier three
unit So you you're kind of placed at a
disadvantage here
now though
you do a simple combine me
you do a simple
you know what you don't combine the
horses yet you do something like this
you sell me
you should have done this in a different
order
you're by me
now we're talking you roll me you roll
me
I'm going to resist the temptation to
run shrimp scampi build here
I love to see a four five that loses to
a five five
they they've built their team to get
money and then uh draws unfortunately
I'm here to tell you I don't think
that's how it's going to work today
too late for dog build it's round four I
think we're I think we're fine man
especially if we keep running into
Charles Dickens build
wow wasn't even close
ref I gotta say it okay it's merely okay
you peace
it is a buff
like there's something to be said about
that
you know
he hates pure stats early on I was
talking about how useful your stance
abilities can be but this is fun this
this is a good one okay oh oh here we go
it's it's the chat build
Cricket whale Ox peacock horse
just you might as well just hand me my
free Victory right now
this is somebody who's way behind on the
vods they don't even they don't know
Wall Street builds meta they don't know
shrimp scampi meta
you also have two horses and a dog
um yeah I suppose that's true isn't it
quite indubitably
don't kill me oh you you're a piece well
we are going to lose this one I don't
know how that happened
hmm
um
we you don't like to see a loss to
somebody who has garlic on an ox like
that's that's bad for your self-esteem
we need another real unit and it's not
going to be shrimp scampi I'll tell you
that much that's the good stuff right
there
eating good in the neighborhood
oh baby we do have a problem though
um we can't really combine them yet
I love a turtle just like that's free
Mount well it's expensive Mountain Armor
but melon armor nonetheless
this could work man this is this is a
build just don't run into hippos no
hippos please
how'd you get a tier V unit this early
you Swan Lord you Swan Lord
foreign
this looks like a loss
it only costs one more gold than a
regular melon yes it costs one more gold
than a regular melon but it also shows
up way early you know it's like if you
were if you lived in uh the U.S Civil
War
you might pay like you know your
country's entire GDP
Lucky Draw in order to get like one
Hellfire missile you'd be like oh you
really want a money-saving strategy why
don't you just like wait 200 years you
can get them for fifty thousand dollars
yeah but it's not worth as much in the
future
if I had one in the Civil War I could
just drop it on like General E Lee's
Outhouse and and end it in one go you
know the earlier you get
some units in this game the more
valuable they are
oh
what did I tell you
what did I tell you
you piece here's the thing you're a
piece
that's a piece right there
oh excuse me
I mean I think you keep rolling the
cricket quite frankly I thought about
the turtle
I think he's it this is pretty good as
is you can you can sell it
we'll just we'll keep it around for the
time being you know what do you think
about that just keep it around for the
time being
unfreeze it
um
I don't think I will
yo you know it's actually kind of a
genius strategy what about what about
this
five five guess what
now you're a seven five
that doesn't spawn anything when you die
oh hello
I don't know how it happened
hello honey
I believed in this man get ready we're
going up against another chat build
level two giraffe also known as free
victories for me
get ready for this this is this is where
you doubted and this is where I win
7-7 get on 9-7 get owned
owned
you're lucky that kangaroo gets two
Buffs
easiest own of my life it actually gets
many more than two we're probably gonna
lose this one
all right
but then we'll just win from this point
onwards because we got scaling why do it
to the cricket I'm gonna be honest with
you okay Iran Burgundy a little bit
someone in chat said pill the cricket
and I said that seems like a great idea
easy place easy place easy place
build me roll me
we're getting close to the point where
we don't need a horse okay I'm not
pilling the deer that's a doubter
strategy
squeeze me pill the dog it's a doubter
strategy
doubter you hear that doubter sell me
this is not a good idea what am I doing
maybe it's okay eight five deer
buy the pill sell the pill that's kind
of legit good play yeah yeah yeah oh no
my dear
oh whatever
sucks anyway
oh oh
splash him
damn I don't think that peacock's gonna
get strong enough man oh
crocodile gets owns dead dead crocodile
says what
can you show a chat you know how to clap
game with my hands clap
hey
oh honey would you give me a kiss
I think that counts I think I think that
was an attempt thank you
you're welcome
her
okay
the snail's gotta go that's a gimme
the can must be purchased
the the rooster must be purchased
the the this should be Frozen and
possibly fed to the dog not IRL
it's very bad for them
but you know I don't even don't let Chad
look at that they love the snake too
much
please
hi honey
oh uh it's a four Squad build what's
happening
are you okay
oh
cool okay melon armor
chat bills
big whoop
this is where the the pure pwnage starts
level to level two
Blowfish is not great but it the garlic
armor soaks it pretty good
well it doesn't even bother me man
doesn't even bother me
now here's the part where you get owned
and then we turn it around on your right
here oops
back to backsu for Daddy please thank
you
roll me
is it too late to roll shrimp scampi
it's not a whale build unfortunately
although
nevertheless
foreign
we gotta we got a squad man we got a
squad
you would be like selling a deer to make
another deer at some point I'll do
I'm doing it
why is the pear Frozen
tastes better that way now you get
buffed
you get rolled
you get Frozen
you get rolled
this is okay we can sell the cow
freeze me roll me buy a turtle a
turtle's okay
freeze me we should have Frozen the pill
probably too this is okay
please please
why did he get rid of deer don't at me
dear good unit also most overrated unit
in the game okay this hippo is gonna run
freaking wild on us
no it's not it's good no it's no oh
please
it's not gonna run that Wild on us
it's only gonna kill my first three
units
that's all right it purges the melon
armor might have accidentally worked out
in our
oh no because you got it back okay well
that's fine I still think it might have
worked out in our favor nice build get
owned
easy win hey
an anonymous gifter I don't know who you
are where you're from what you did as
long as you subbed me thank you much
appreciated
okay this forget pilling the turtle
now we're thrilling the turtle
I'm going to be honest I think it's one
of these
and I think it's one of those
there was a dog in the shop
he's a Sleeper Man
we're in a win now mode
it's a bit spooky
sorry we don't care for our sheep that's
all you peace but easy easy piece except
we live because of our turkey
oh baby that's a win this is a win
stake giraffe at the front it is it's a
bold move to put a unit that Buffs units
that are in front of it at the very
front
ladies and gentlemen the uh
the Believers have won again hope you
win all in that time let me guess no
that I already lost my points on the
last one
sad
now let me tell you something okay this
might surprise you turkey one up is good
Tech in case it gets sniped
I'm very eager to get you to level two
I'm very eager to realize that this
doesn't apply really to anybody but our
Turtle so let's not freeze it
I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of Statin
you I'm not I'm not against a melon
armor on the turtle that creates melon
armor but
listen you peace I always believe I
always go at least 80 percent in
that that can't be a good strategy long
term
what the heck is this squad am I am I
getting meta-gamed right now
what is this
they had they moved their bus like one
back to protect it from anti-bus
technology itself
you peace
well this is a loss
wow that's a strong hippo
I lived
I died hey though Believers look at that
the Believers get paid out once more
I don't know what we we needed a
scorpion up at the front basically to
win that one
start my prediction again run it back
we've had a good believer to doubter
coefficient here
uh one of sheep could have been a
workable move there for sure all right
so I'm basically oh what the hell is
this man
the hell is this don't
either wet noses
this is a terrible start this is like
we're starting a loss down
oh my God
yeah we lose we lose to a uh oh no you
know what we actually draw because of
the 50 50 going in our favor what a
dream
okay you got you gotta work with me here
okay
I'm I'm gonna because we drew
I'm gonna do something you're probably
not gonna be a huge fan of
I'm gonna Double Down
I think we can take a fish we we need
something that has some stats
next turn we try to get to that tier
three then we sell sell sell Scamp me
Scamp me
by all accounts this should be a loss
we're going up against essentially a
meta build well maybe not meta but at
least it has it has a synergy
that's fine we knew this one was like a
loss
yeah this 50 50 fish by turn 10
guaranteed
he's not a piece well maybe a little
we needed a beaver we saw a beaver
well you know what to be honest we
hold on let me think okay let me think
for a second
combine me seven gold
buy me
four gold
okay you're gonna hate this man you're
gonna hate this okay
no you're gonna love this
sell me
sell me
buy me
sell me
Freeze Me freeze me
roll me one time
I don't know why I thought you would
still have the Buffs but we were at a
surplus of one gold
now six seven swan
Don't Mind If I Do
sell me
well
buy me
roll me
freeze me
we're about to have two of the strongest
units you're ever going to see
owns
whatever we traded no sweat just don't
lose that we we can't lose this one it's
a it's a big problem
that's fine as long as you don't get HP
[Laughter]
I knew it I knew it I knew it okay one
one nothing wrong with that man there's
nothing wrong with a one one then watch
this oh baby seven seven Beaver okay now
is a camel okay
you sell you're probably gonna sell a
spider
this Swan is going to get nuts I don't
even think you roll peacock I think you
just rolled camel into like incredible
swan
sell me
buy me freeze me
roll me
not bad
not bad this this is a certified not bad
situation look at this oh my God oh my
God
this is not bad in the slightest man
it's gonna be Beaver V dog and we're
gonna win easily
it really it does want me to take the
peacock but too bad
I'm off on my I'm on my own wave right
now
I don't know if we should try to make a
beaver get even stronger
although it is a nice sell late like you
don't feel as bad about getting that
late sell
I'm I'm loco man I'd love to keep you
around for stats dude honestly I know
that's crazy talk but you know what I'm
a bit of a crazy guy
I'm a bit of a crazy guy I'm Gonna Roll
a four Squad right now
if you got a problem with it
am I Really Gonna Roll this shop next
turn elephant into camel no because
camel already has the melon it doesn't
deserve it we'll just we'll keep it like
that for now
I'm so crazy talk is just like talk to
me
unfreeze elephant well it's still got
stats let's not throw the dang baby out
with the bathwater man
what is this build I'm so anytime I see
fuss pots
I know I'm going up against somebody who
has like uh
a PhD and
theoretical
combinatorics and I say to myself this
is not good for me and yet I also say to
myself
appears my swan has been owning you
thusly
that's the dream buff
get owned
we win again
almost had me
almost had me
RNG
oh but look at this look at this though
holy crap
um
sell me
buy me what happens if you combine
snails
only one way to find out
what
I mean it's still I mean I'm not going
to cry about it 86 snail man
unfreeze me
you got to do it on the level up
nevertheless I mean that's still pretty
good I would love to see like uh like a
poodle now
oh we're feasting we're feasting
thanks for not taking my melon armor oh
sorry you died
oh sorry your strongest unit got uh
eaten by melon armor oh sorry you uh
missed I was gonna say lethaling Me by
one but I was looking at the wrong stuff
that's fine you're still owned thanks
for the free win
foreign
buffer
this is a no-brainer
are we really you look okay for now sure
for now for you for sure
for sure
freeze me
it's the same art
what's up with that
can me
they're all emojis you're an emoji
ever consider that
you cannot defe they can't resist us Mr
Powers you can't resist us Mr Powers
nice attempt
flapping bits Beavis and Butthead Emoji
it's pretty good that's pretty good
that's some pretty good stuff there
well this is a big buff
on a Dodo we love to see that
whoa that's the wrong button
yeah yeah yeah yeah now we're talking
honestly if you if you're gonna be like
a a-hole like this then sure eat one of
these eat up yummy yummy
two messages back to back dodo so
overrated dodo top tier No Cap this is
the same individual man
too bad uh I'm better
um in some ways wait this might be bad
no I think our Beaver could do it
I think our Beaver leads us to the
promised dramas land
thank you beaver and a draw is a huge
win because we're scaling
Leave it to Beaver great episode title
name great episode title name
Beaver could use some garlic or we could
sell them to get some stats rolling in
the future
I'm a I'm a Believer in Rolling for cans
okay you gotta you gotta play monkey
and I think you play it at the expense
of your giraffe
so sell me buy me
buy me buy me sell me now we might get
another cow so for now just freeze me
you see that fonker
buy me
build me
build me sell me
Freeze Me freeze me holy
[Laughter]
four piece
me
we're rolling a four-man Marty here
you gotta leave your beaver some room to
breathe
okay early shark scares the the bejesus
out of me but it's only a level one
horse but man that shark is going to be
Mighty strong
our garlic Swan is gonna eat them up
with some fava beans and a nice Chianti
that Ox is just pure luck what can you
say just like no shot no shot
as long as we live long enough to kill
the shark
that's all that matters man
ambitious of you to put anything on the
docket after Super Auto pets it's
actually like I'm not expecting
especially with the salary leaks I'm not
expecting anybody to be like sympathetic
to this but it's like I could play
another hour of Super Auto pets or there
is a beautiful Timber uh timber-born
Bounty a city Builder that's good with a
bounty associated with it oh
how how bad do you want to play more
Super Auto pets though
pretty bad to be honest with you
it's a tough it's a tough one man
I'll probably play Timber board not just
for the Bounty I did want to check it
out at some point anyway then Super Auto
pets sucked up all my time and then they
were like here's a bounty and I was like
you have my attention now okay
this is the thinking man's Gambit you
definitely start here
I sleep
this is really good there's two lines
okay there's monkey buffing camel or
Dragon cell Beaver roll for tier one's
Buy sell buy me sell me buy me sell me
or rooster
getting a little slice of the dodo
and you know what after everything we've
been through
I think you sell Beaver it's very rarely
had to attack anyway
we finally get that buff you buy monkey
you buy rooster
you get
Hannah Montana The Best of Both Worlds
it's not a shark build really
I'll take that
we're on turn 10
with a middling build but a build oh
yeah sorry sorry dodo is supposed to be
buffing my rooster my mistake
oh nice 17 damage just kidding
hey nice uh bus uh just kidding hey you
gotta it's quite the rooster there be
ashamed for just kidding
you gotta it's a very similar build you
got here
is gonna be tight
I think I think we draw
because of the garlic armor
oh wait well we dry anyway but
very famous quote from Derek Zoolander I
can derelict my own balls of course
um we want to do it like this probably
although I do we it's just it's very
simple we need the dodo
I don't know we need the dodo to get
to level three for now I can live with
this
maybe it's fine you are a 14 15. that's
pretty good
I'm rolling past the camel for now like
we're fishing for
bigger and better things let's go
one up doesn't matter too much here
melon
sure
that's in the service of you getting
stronger in the future
you can freeze me a pizza
it's just sweet and pizza by the way
okay
why not Brewster is good I mean it comes
back as a one one
so
it gets killed it spawns an 8-1 and a
one one and then one of the one ones
when it dies becomes uh
a one one
is actually a little whack if I dare say
so myself
you're a piece
it's all right that's that's why you put
that armor out there
that's a win right there
that's a Believer payout would you would
you believe it you better believe it
yummy yummy
I think you put it on the dodo you gotta
get a better efficacy on the dodo
oh dude
okay
yeah okay I could see camel buffing
rooster also makes sense
very lucky with our hippo here
your kangaroos is gonna get strong it's
not gonna get that strong
it is going to get exactly strong enough
to kill us
snake kills monkey irrelevant I say it
again irrelevant
I do not fear your chicken built
as we have our own chicken built and
this is yet another win
move me roll me we don't buy apples at
this stage of the game we don't you know
what actually some garlic could could
function it's all about incremental
benefits when we get the chance
I I know I said I was looking for
something a little different
that that's a play right there
we're gonna try we're gonna invest
it's not the best Squad I've ever had
but it's it's something
very similar T level three though
there's a level three team with a one-up
flamingo very scary very scary
although dude oh dirty we still we still
do it we still live we live long enough
to not die and then to hit you again
which will kill the camel which will
bring back a 33-1 which will kill the
dodo and we win
let's go
you sell the monkey
you buy a tiger
The Roosters are out of control and you
can roll this two different ways man you
could roll four roosters well no you
can't okay this is the way it should be
never mind I apologize for getting a
little bit ahead of myself
I will try to get to a level three dodo
it speaks to me
get buffed honestly you're already
basically maxed you should you should
get buffed
freeze me
[Laughter]
is this gonna be your game of the year
it is right now honestly it is
I and nothing else is like like
WarioWare was a lot of fun but like
people can laugh at it all you want you
know
it just shows how how gatekeeping the
internet can be sometimes oh it's it
can't be your game of the year it's not
a Metroid yeah get over yourself here's
your Metroid
this is a win baby
still with level one swan baby
I don't worry about the significance
within the industry of the game that I
give game of the year to
if it's my favorite game while I used to
but if it's my favorite game of the year
congrats here's your game of the year
award
sushi
yummy yummy
honestly you're gonna laugh I think we
get get ready to put a b at the back
just in case
oh pog
what about repentance it's great I'm
just like
I I have entered a period in Isaac where
I'm like
I am happy to not be playing it on the
stream anymore I'm I'm happy to be
having a little tolerance break from it
for the time being
Super Auto pets your music saved me
this is still a win
is so good dude wait is that 10. oh
I'm a little surprised but hey man level
two dodo tiger let's enshrine them level
one tiger obviously
level two dodo rooster Swan and camel
oh baby
who would have thought well let's put a
slash marker there



hey everybody we are back
white hoodie tells you three things by
the way one is
Jay wolves in my door amazing designer
number two is the same day as the
previous videos number three it's
getting a little chilly outside
when it's chilly I don't make the rules
you play free to play animals to try to
break our our drought of merely doing
pretty well
but not doing amazing so you you invest
in
future wins here this is this is the
dream you get a fish the fish becomes a
three four I don't make the rules that
means it easily wins the game
um
I think what if you ran your strong unit
at the front you ever think about that
what about the the Milky the Milky eyes
milky eyes they're watching you they see
your ever removed
you guys you guys like Hall and Oates
yeah okay
that that might make a difference right
there by the way
that's a win look at that didn't even
have to use our otter which is great
because our otter is a one too that has
already served its uh purpose
um
this is the way you run the deck is
basically thusly you know you you buy
two horses for early game uh victory
points
we freeze you we roll you
we duck we freeze we unfreeze
these are these are Big potential plays
here don't combine roll me one more time
freeze me again I would not mind rolling
a level two and a level one horse here
early on we want to be careful not to
get shoehorned into the horse build for
life but go ahead shoot my horses see if
I care
you shot my mosquito oh wait a minute
hey look at that though look at the
trade we get as a result of that
um this is a loss though
you just got a better Squad I can't
really be upset
it's just a better team there
um but tier three is where like our
units can really start to shine
you're gonna do this first okay then
you're gonna
cell
so that your bi or you're really so the
duck gets stronger
um
I'm not sold on these I I wish that I
were I sincerely do
um I think you definitely do roll a
cricket I think you freeze a swan
for when your horses get combined you're
definitely going to dump a mosquito
um a Dodo is good enough in my world to
at least hold pig is interesting now too
because we can basically make a 6'3 Pig
and and it'll cost us three but then
sell it back for two on the next turn
shoot the cricket please
you peace sorry we we don't really care
if our mosquito gets traded like it
makes no difference
um we're gonna lose again
not a great start we we need more stats
okay
we're losing in the stats Department
right here go go ahead run me
see if I care
we're one win two losses all I'd say
about this for the time being is that it
looks worse than it is
I think you can you buy a duck honestly
to like sell a duck
which makes your dodo that much stronger
for the future
roll me one time
you peace
I think we've come to the point where we
we benefit more from stats than anything
else
um
honestly I think you roll Swan up at the
front
and then a little dodo just just like
chilling behind
I think you sell this and and buy this
and it's
is that of no great pleasure but we need
to start picking up some wins a little
little 10-5 swan up at the front against
the 3-4
dodo at the back I I see the problems
here
um I'm very scared of what this peacock
can do to our uh our fairly weak Squad
I think we lose this one
well this is a big hit well no it's not
really
it's like exactly not enough
this is a disaster I don't know what
else to say
where are we at one win three losses
one win too low one win one win three
losses my my word
okay sell me giraffe has some plays man
a giraffe buffing a dodo
giraffe that's the sound that a giraffe
makes I had no idea
um
selling a horse because the squad just
doesn't work you know better better to
get out of it as soon as possible I
think
I guess we should have not sold the
horse before we yeah okay fair enough
but
I'm thinking this is important Maybe not
immediately but
soon
um
giraffe giraffe
freeze well there's no point in freezing
that I would say
okay
um this is a weird build this is like
desperation
I see an 812 whale a level two horse and
a dog
and I say to myself you know what this
is probably
a a guaranteed loss
I don't know how we would get out of
this I mean this is look the free to
play Gamers on on a Canadian long
weekend here they're really bring in
their a game
um we just got bodied that went nowhere
man
okay don't even give me my points I
don't want them I don't need them
now this is a squad now this is a squad
look at this
look at this
look at this roll me
that's a good freeze that dude we could
deliberately
throw a couple rounds
I got uncertain ABS that's fine
um
we could throw a couple rounds which
seems pretty spicy but to be able to
sell
two or three ducks and then just like
you know ball out statistically speaking
is a dream come true we knew this was
probably a loss
you know the duck is a one-two it's not
uh it's not the strongest unit in the
game
now if we're gonna buy you we do it
right away
that's fine
I think
we throw this around
don't combine just just move please just
move it's hard it's hard whatever I'm
gonna I'm gonna accept that
I'm going to freeze a pig
no okay now I'm gonna unfreeze I'm gonna
freeze a fish because the fish will be
five six next turn after we sell our
ducks so I expect to lose this one too
that's not really a big deal honestly
yeah I don't expect to win this one
I can tell you that we will not be
winning this one but we have set
ourselves up for for a situation where I
will not be happy unless I get like
three or four consecutive wins here
based on the way that we did this okay
so sell me
sell me
sell me
now you're gonna you're gonna shove a
six four out there you're going to shove
a five six out there
I Think You're Gonna Roll a a six five
hedgehog at the back we're not gonna
peacock or pill this guy right now
peacock just for for two at his timing
um
I think we're gonna sell our horse
now sell sell the otter for now
because you can still get a buff on your
peacock for the time being
roll me one more time
we know a cell is incoming okay
so this is this is the duck Gambit we
want to see a three attack or less at
the front
sounds good to me I would well don't
shoot my front unit please thank you
that literally doesn't matter
probably the best thing that could have
happened
we Crush you
we crushed you yeah we trade but
we Crush you
now at some point this Hedgehog is not
going to be sticking around but that
point is not yet
there's a part of me it's like you buy
you buy into it but
for now why don't you why don't you
freeze me why don't you roll me
you peace
if we're gonna do it we should have done
it earlier you know what there you go
now we get a whale this is nice we sell
you we have our whale it's gonna screw
up the stats something fierce here
but ah we need the peacock to move up
one so it gets hit by the Buffs of the
peak of the of the flamingo
but we see three at the front don't
don't shoot my front line unit please
big whoop
whatever our fish is going to be
incredible
love it
listed
our peacock is gonna get hit by the
second buff at least so there's
something there I guess
this looks okay
in fact it looks a lot better than okay
look at that so is that what the crunchy
pieces is it are two wins that we asked
for for throwing two runs away early
now a duck I think is a little late
um I think the time is the fish is good
okay it's time to sell it
in order to unhurt give friend behind
plush
one plus two the camel peacock Synergy
is really good
but how do you ensure that the camel
gets hurt but doesn't die similarly you
look at an ox okay
you can get two nice Triggers on the aux
I think we roll that for now
and then an elephant combined with a
camel is the play you're looking for but
it is what it is
still is what it still is
um I think we want you to if you're not
going to have garlic we might as well
have you hit kind of hard and then maybe
this is like extra super draw technology
I'm and our peacock is not getting the
buff that we want anymore but again this
is like
it's it's for a purpose okay
this is a weird one
I don't know what to think about boom
City here three seven I like it
nice melon armor I I congratulate you on
your melon armor
we still slap you
and we're slapping you that means we're
slapping you which means we're slapping
you
we barely get through this but we did it
okay
now this Hedgehog is just chilling back
there he's biting this time he's waiting
he's waiting for his moment
giraffe is is a is a character man you
know what you do so Flamingo has been
good I would never want to deny that
um
but we can flamingo
I mean it's a A7 right I don't want to
say no to that but I'm also like I think
you can dump it
it hasn't actually had to attack yet
then
buy a Dodo okay this gives plus one plus
one to these two units the dodo feeds
its attack forward and we get permanent
melon armor on the ox that's that's
pretty sick now the problem from this
point forward
is that we need something
thank you in front of our whale that
gets a benefit upon being consumed
um
and we don't have that
so
I'm like do you have a whale that eats a
whale
do you just make your Ox that much
stronger with like uh
I mean you you gotta try to roll a squad
right but whatever we get it pretty much
has to go in front and nothing that we
have does well in front nor do any of
these
don't talk to me
this is not good but
I think sometimes you can find yourself
in a situation where
you know it this is the way to play it
even though it looks truly insane I
expect a loss by the way and it looks
like we're gonna play up to that
expectation
[Laughter]
but I don't what oh nil bog bog Goblin a
fellow a fellow film Enthusiast I don't
know what what else we we would have
done there honestly you can run an ant
at the front now if you want I mean
obviously things are quite dangerous
turkey's really good man
um
but I it doesn't fit what we're trying
to do
kangaroo does work nicely right here
then you're like you gotta sell a whale
then it's like that it's the only way
because the squad just doesn't work like
the way we're trying to equip it
this is not good this turn seven I'm
looking at this squad and I'm saying to
myself it's it's trash it's no good
look at this cutie baby oh my word
Kate I'm getting torn up in Super Auto
pets right now
I'm rich P bod and the panicking
bagpipes like
they're trying to send me to the shadow
Realm
and I think it's gonna work
hello
oh
I really okay a really good tweet what
is the tweet
do you know what true love is okay I
can't help but feel like I'm about to
get absolutely roasted
yeah is this a
true oh no
you're you're laughing
oh and even though you're in pain you
give a hug back and say I love you to
them oh that's sweet despite she she
just kicked your boob hey honey
hey
can we do can you look over here
peekaboo
a peek-a-boo good job
where's your
head there's your head where's your nose
no no that's we're still working on that
one a little bit
hey peekaboo
peekaboo
she's she's very happy right now
probably because she
'd be like I made mommy laugh
[Laughter]
very happy she was coughing for a long
time
she knows some of these animals maybe
fish you know fish
what an achiever it's the beaver
yay
your peace
how dare you
what do you juice me squeeze me
freezer I think there's a freezer right
there
excuse me that's a freeze right there
oh
honestly I think this would be an
amazing game uh for a baby
to introduce them to you know a little
bit of strategy a little bit of
mathematics
probably not at that level
you know Minecraft is it's a monolith
you know it's a that's a big game
oh look at this
it's it's non-violent you know the
enemies just kind of like you know bump
into each other
now this has had you want to see the
secret Cape we just unlocked level two
units right yeah or tier two
then you create
a level two unit it takes you one level
higher so even though it's only turn
three all of a sudden now we got a a
tier three unit that can freaking go
roll me once
excuse me
sell me
excuse me
I don't know I just make it up as I go
buy me
this is gonna be a buy me sell me thrill
me freeze me deck squeeze me I'm can I
I'm gonna I'm gonna make a bold
prediction
and that bold prediction is I don't need
a full Squad to win this one
buy me
sorry that's what freeze me this is a
tease me
and don't bereave me I don't want to be
bereaved
yeah watch this
here's your elephant
yeah nice nice peacock you got there uh
except for how I killed it easily
wow nice ants
finally my hand gets destroyed oh tough
luck for you all of a sudden I got a 9-6
kangaroo Med 55 is out here posting on
the forums how did he get a kangaroo on
turn three
it doesn't make any sense well
life's hard
look at that five eight ants it's it's
getting out of control then you're gonna
buy a beaver then you're gonna sell me
that's a that's a bit of a tease but a
bit of a squeeze
I think you're gonna buy me I think
you're gonna buy me
I'm gonna be honest with you I think
following these buys you do this by
right here in the interest of making our
aunt live longer so our kangaroo does
better
this is we don't lose these our stats
are way too good
I I feel like there's like a flow chart
in gaming
um well actually this is a pretty spicy
Squad but you're not gonna make a spider
and a b your squad's too full
there you congratulations you played
yourself
ah
this is pretty good like when when
you're winning
easily which and I don't mean to just
play up the bravado but when you're
winning easily you invest in your
economy when you're losing you invest in
the squad and we're winning easily so we
got some we got some economy investment
going on here that's three wins
trying to get over that five hump
I mean this is a pill me
no doubt about it
then you gotta think
I'm a big fan of some some buy me sell
me's okay
you're gonna lose a lot of the stats
that we would get if I like you're gonna
give a plus four plus two
then you're gonna get re-summoned as
like a piece of crap
I feel like the whale is not worth it
here I feel like that's that's a bit of
a trap
now we're talking
I kind of
um
we want you to stay alive
I think we're gonna you know what shrimp
me
buy me
ah
ah garlic me
freeze me
dog
I I sleep dog
I'm I'm starting to regret getting rid
of the flamingo but you know what look
at this we're buffed
we're buffed
it's the biggest shrimp you're ever
gonna see in your life
we still get you
please we still get you though
that's four wins four wins zero losses
now there this is where you get some Buy
sell him him me him me him me this ant I
do think it's time for it to go I think
we roll a combination build I think we
sell the ants
but not before we buy the second shrimp
then we sell you
then we buy you then
then we roll we're looking for yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Freeze Me freeze me
sell me
buy me
squeeze me
Romy
roll me Freeze Me freeze me
and my word
my word honey
this is a bit of a spicy build we
haven't lost one even though we're
rolling exclusively
some shrimps and some some swans
big whoop nice dolphin for me to poop on
now this is not great
um this is probably a loss
two Rams is a is a it's a very nasty
situation
the dog is going to outpace our uh our
Swan obviously because that's what it
does
this is going to be our first loss but
you know what it's not a sign of things
to come
it's just a necessary step in the in the
middle shrimp meat no shrimp okay then I
mean this is just
you go wild here you copy the level one
ability from the unit ahead
there's something to be said
[Laughter]
for a little
I think we don't want a turtle actually
as sad as that sounds because he's a
nice boy
you go heavy on the kangaroo
you sell the cow
you buy
Google we still roll this for now
but we got to think about our future
from this point out so we basically got
another level one kangaroo that's not
doing too much back there right now but
we really need to get that garlic going
too I see a level one dodo this is a
squad that scales that doesn't mean it's
a squad that wins immediately
we get a nice hit here we get some melon
armor kill the peacock in one go
the kangaroo will not kill us in one go
the dodo gets iced
the giraffe gets iced okay have we done
it have we broken the five win curse
nope five wins
we've been here before don't forget
so if We're Not Gonna Roll a parrot
because we're probably not then you sell
then you buy then you sell
and the Buffs are coming Fast and
Furious
and then we probably want to buy we
probably want to buy
at some point we're going to sell our
swan
I'm thinking about but I think this
turtle is honestly not long for this
world
though I though I'm loathed to admit it
but you know what I like I like where
your head's at
I think it's a combine me
buy me
sell me
Turtle me it's a bit weird
really relying on our kangaroo to do a
hundred percent of the damage
hey
Penguins they buff level two and level
three units uh every turn they can they
can get Mighty spicy if I do say so
myself this is a loss by the oh oh
this is a a 100 loss
oh my God
please just let me get to more than five
that's I I recognize I've played fast
and loose with the with the situation
here
I will be done very soon by the way
okay bye bye see you soon honey
um
this is a big play I think you
absolutely
kill the turtle to get the melon armor
and then we want you to continue to get
buffed I mean look at this thing it's an
11 22 thanks to the shrimp the shrimp
and Swan will not live forever but I'm
happy they're here right now
um I think maybe we freeze this
we're looking for some big plays right
obviously I I'm not totally sold on a
hippo
for the time being I would probably say
we're going to give it a chance
just because we need something
um
roll me
it's a buy
for the incredible buff sell
that's okay and then maybe you freeze a
kangaroo
and run like uh
you can start to think about running an
AUX huh it's turn nine
but it'll scale pretty nicely you're
going to get sold soon you're going to
get sold soon yeah I think we can roll
an ox here
now this is the last
uh I mean especially because we're only
two lives left this is the last one
where I'm like
we're gonna roll this meme build that we
got okay
it's the last one of those
not the last video where we do that
because that's kind of like I guess my
thing
um but it's the last uh
while we busted through the melon armor
a little bit that's fine
um wow
you're a piece that's that's a win for
you what a strange Squad but a b with a
fedora gets the job done now we have to
Pivot to strength is basically what I'm
trying to say so
um if we're gonna do that the swan
should go first because then we get an
HP buff then the time has come goodbye
are we gonna roll a hippo I don't know
what I do know is we're definitely
rolling that
so I think you can look at this as whale
man it's it's such a crappy whale to be
here late but
we get a nice double buff out of that
you probably sell the hippo
monkey you know it's scales so there's
there's a lot to like there
I'm like I was gonna do a buy me sell me
but there's no point
deer also obviously does nice here but
let's roll with the mammoth and and see
I guess we'll roll a monkey up at the
front I'm not optimistic I think we're
gonna get stuck at five wins again
I I genuinely do
we're starting to run into some serious
problems
um
I think that they're in the process of
making a turkey build work they're not
quite there yet
that doesn't mean they'll lose To Us by
the way they could very easily beat us
[Laughter]
we'll see
we are at 3143 with melon armor but then
like you know it it adds up pretty fast
that Ox is going to be a real problem
like you get a b and then we hit you
okay we hit you
we're gonna live through this and kill
you oh we're gonna die through this but
that's okay we've broken the curse six
wins six wins it's possible
it's possible
honestly like your whale should just
have a stake
if it's going to do anything at all and
I think melon armored beats garlic late
game IMO so I'm very content with this
do we want garlic on anybody I don't
think so I think we're maybe investing
in cans or rolls long term so
for now we gotta
it it really the the whole run lives and
dies on our kangaroo we've we've made a
mistake there and we're way late on our
pivot oh my God this this Blowfish into
Snake the Monkey is whatever they'll
Blowfish into snake is is disastrous
it didn't hit my melon armor which is
the only positive
it's gonna
[Laughter]
yeah
um there's no way we get through the
gorilla like that's fine we're not even
getting through the crocodile man we're
lucky to get through the snake well I'll
take it okay all things considered I'll
take it
six wins thanks for watching we got
there in the end if you enjoyed it click

honey we were going to play a new game
but then we got sucked into the sap
mines again here we go we are playing on
the free-to-play deck
get the free to play deck pump in here
let's see this is not my ideal first
shop there are no fish there are no ants
okay but that doesn't mean we can't make
something function here you can do this
even though i don't love a horse you can
oh but dude i'm so stupid hold on
let's get a dang casino roll in here
sorry
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
i am a robot i am your father
and if we're gonna do this hold on will
nell get six wins or more
two minutes betting time you know we got
a tweet i'm sorry
i need to update drivers before we play
more the good life sorry
we're playing super auto pets though
get in here or be cursed with mosquito
shops all day
cool guy voice making a comeback people
thought it was dead man
the rumors of my demise
are greatly
exaggerated
it's because we haven't been talking to
mouth that much lately not like out of
like design
it's just uh just hasn't you know the
the stars have not aligned i've been
i've been missing a lot of mondays okay
so we freeze you that you're a last
chance buy
i should have kept the otter around but
this this is functional this is not so
bad you can play an ant at the back he's
ready to crack
you're laughing there's a man at the
back he's ready to crack his eyes are as
red as the sun and there's a girl in the
corner who is nobody's mourner and she
thinks she's the passionate one and
you're laughing
hello chibly hello this is drawable
we got a very similar squad don't shoot
my horse don't shoot my who you mother
literally like the worst thing that
could have possibly happened there okay
the foamy pencils congrats one in three
shot just won you the game big whoop you
peace
okay this this is now a squad that wins
rounds
i know this looks a little goofy
we're gonna freeze you we're gonna we're
gonna make you chunk it we're gonna roll
you we're gonna freeze you
um
we can roll a horse for a bit we don't
need that this is fine this is fine
this is a winnable round if we draw it's
okay i don't see a loss happening
i just don't see it man i just don't see
it
we trade with the beaver
the horses are relevant
it's not really part of the squad uh
what the heck uh we lose this we lose
these
we win these
i told we draw these i told you
[Laughter]
i got my horses in the front
okay
um this is fine now we need to make a
tier three unit
tier two unit in the tier three unit
this is fine now you can head to the
back
we can put a whale out here mighty quick
make me think it's mighty quick
we will roll a temporary horse
that's a big freeze
we don't need to freeze a pill that's a
big okay this is another winter draw
this is a win or draw
we'll probably sell the crickets start
wailing the ants and then we're off to
the freaking races
or saying look in that temporary it's
round three we barely even gotten
started yet man
i don't break character till the dvd
commentary this is a win i don't even
need i don't even need to tell you this
is a win
you get owns we can we can go a little
faster on this one like
this is not a spectator sport
hello chibley by the way dedicated hey
button hey what's up
bro
i sleep but you know what tier 2 units
they can do some work early man
i'm thinking
you piece
so a turtle is worth rolling we won't
roll it right away but it's worth
rolling i think we rolled this squad
right here roll me once
swan me we replace the fish with the
swan the horse we're not gonna invest in
long term
these are some big buffs this squad
doesn't scare me a dodo that hasn't
scaled yet
and a level two cricket a giraffe that
hasn't had time to scale like your sheep
is a little nasty a little freaky
but so what
it doesn't get buffed by anything i'm
not sweating it look at this dude look
at this cricket this is no problem
put me on put me on high speed
that being said we are gonna lose
but our squad looks good for the future
so we're two two losses down two hp down
but health is a resource
you get sold
you get bought
giraffe is not hyper relevant to our
concerns cricket gets sold
in favor
we're doing a slow
transition here
okay
from from spam build to good build
i would love a level two turtle straight
up i would love a level two turtle give
me garlic armor on the swan this is a
this is a draw to win
terry's coming out there whale at the
front that's it i've seen it work it's
when you want a whale but you don't have
anything that works well with a whale as
a result you want to keep the whale
but you're you're mostly just holding it
for uh
for future considerations
you peace
you peace
you peace
easy wins
okay
it's not a scampi build i don't look at
this as a shrimp scampi build
i look at this as a roll
then i start to tell you okay start to
tell you something
giraffe scaling is okay is is okay a
horse no longer has to exist
our ant is going to be next to go
probably um an ox does okay here
you can make it you can make it go
you don't give it meat
because um
the the problem with that is that it
gets overridden by the turtle's garlic
armor which will come out
i'm i'm kind of a believer in this just
for the time being we can swap out of it
later
i'm a believer in this
i'm a believer in rolling i'm a believer
in freezing and then getting a sick unit
next turn
melon will override the meat yeah i
guess that's literally exactly what i
said isn't it
like i'm not being rude i'm saying i'm
stupid and bought the thing i didn't put
it on the ox because i was like uh oh
it'll be a waste on the ox but then
instead i put it on another unit that
had the same concern this bus actually
just crapped on us and then and that's
just uh that's a sequence of returns
risk there wow that's a heck of a loss
there
okay this we gotta we gotta get out of
this asap you still do this for a
top-tier unit
i'm just going to be straight up with
you man i'm not sold on the concept of
this turtle anymore the hippo we need
some scaling to make it work
you're gonna you're gonna spat out as a
4-7 huh
sell me
buy me
you can't suck up a buff unfortunately
it would be nice to even just have like
a b on you to get an extra trigger on
the aux but it is what it is it is what
it is okay you know what you can do here
i don't really don't want to get rid of
that ant i think we go heavy rerolls
okay this is good i mean it's fine
sell me even though the 4-3 ant is some
good stuff you sell me by me for hippo
scaling
roll me
if you can get a dodo to start popping
there's a chance
is a chance
this is a big moment though i see a duck
with a b which is gonna get a double ox
trigger
level two horse hey fs viper thank you
for the gifted subscriptions thank you
we still we get a melon armor which
scales us
we do uh we simply trade with the dog
unfortunately but then we get melon
armor on the ox
which means we win okay
there's something there's two wins three
wins three wins
now we are hoping to scale our hippo
with a dodo we need a little bit more
uh of the juice and squeeze variety
a giraffe is a little bit too slow we
know that's not going to be long for
this world
that donkey donkey donkey donkey donkey
dunk we roll again
we roll once more
we try this is a simple try
the hippo's gonna get melon armor your
hippo's gonna pop but guess what
my hippo's gonna pop
and it's gonna keep popping
and it's gonna keep popping
it's not going to keep popping past that
but that's still really good
we get some melon armor you're dead easy
wins
we're starting the you can feel the
wheels are starting to get some traction
here
up to a 50
minimum 50 win rate
kangaroo can do some work behind the
hippo in theory you could sell a swan to
try to make it work you can also peel
the turtle
to just get permanent melon armor
and then
i do want the buff
from the dodo to apply but we can stall
a little bit
like we can can for example
and then do a double buy here
that's a huge freeze
it's not really a shark build in my
opinion
freeze that
we would like to get um garlic armor on
our kangaroo but man we want to see
white weenie built this is not a white
weenie build this is hell
[Laughter]
this is a loss that's uh this is a one
heck of a
team this is nasty man
you see in this 18 1918 spider
my my word all right well we'll pay out
the doubters i mean that's a that's a
strong team
would have been nice to have not lost
some of those early rounds but you know
there's nobody to blame but everybody
but myself uh choose outcome
doubters win i repeat doubters win start
prediction pop me out once you pop me
out i never stop
start me up once you start me up i never
stop six wins
try again early shops change everything
man
don't
like this is also not a strong early
shop but i buy a duck 100 of the time
i have no qualms nor complaints about
running a two duck pig build taking an
early loss to get better later
absolutely we are the smooth sausages if
you want to doubt because i'm going duck
billed then then go ahead vote doubt i
can't stop you
this is a loss you expect to lose though
against uh against the ducks you expect
to lose
all right i mean with ducks i should say
the creamy legs
and then we either sell round two or we
sell round three
i see another duck
i see a little silhouetta of a duck
now the ants does better for us
and then we buff
honestly i'm a cell
bi
in this situation then we buff the fish
now i i am content
going down two losses already
don't shoot the ant
i can live with this
i i run this build every night in my
dreams
this is a definite loss obviously
but
now this is where the party starts man
you just gotta use your brain
rather than combine
i genuinely think you go
sell
sell
sell
now you have a five five dog
a four or five cricket
i'm gonna i'm just gonna level with you
a five-five mosquito is also pretty
freaking sick
um
and then we just buy an apple to scale
our dog temporarily we got a seven seven
dog chilling at the back
i will freeze two flamingos to make this
work this is where the party starts we
we do not lose this round you can't you
don't lose this round
this is an easy win
i know you're like comedic timing i
promise you it's not happening
a stats are way too strong
that makes you a little bit of a peace
you peace
you're at peace
yeah we didn't even have to use our dog
no sweat
ants can go its stats are unimpressive
insubordinate and churlish
give me a give me a two piece
we need to scale our units a little
faster
freeze me unfreeze me we don't lose this
one either
hmm 1010 beaver a little stinky though
i still don't think we lose though
yeah our dog solos the last two units no
sweat
look at this still owns
still owns
why are all the names in chat white
um bt tv is broken
for some reason
this is easy money you want to see this
you um
pill me
by me
combine me
you wanna you wanna see something
strange
buy me
sell me
are you a bad enough dude to do this
i don't think so i think i'm a bad
enough dude to do this
freeze me
roll me
by me
freeze me
scamp me no we're not in scampi yet okay
we're not quite in scampi tier
okay we're lowering somebody's hp by two
you piece
you're swallowing a spider
this doesn't seem that bad
it's gonna be it's gonna be close
you're going to spit out a little spider
your spider's going to get a little
stronger
your spider's then going to generate
another unit
i mean this is still a whim
is everybody you said like it's it's
real this is actually really bad that
was an easy win we just had to use our
backline unit for the first time
um
so i'm a big believer
i understand like the the dog meta here
but i'm a big believer in pill me selmy
which gives us
for a net cost of zero
gives us stats on the dog
there's not really a whale me involved
here though
it's more like a
it's more like a freeze me roll me
the way i see it
okay
freeze me freeze me
roll me
try me
i'm content
to lose
this round to get a double snail i think
that's the kind of kickstart we could
use
i'm not too worried about uh about a
hedgehog here we go we got some hp
involved there like a garlic armor on
our dog will help us
you live through this which is amazing
that's the most beautiful buff we could
have asked for it did nothing for you
we own you easily
okay
two damage to all which is one damage to
all and then you're dead
i think we we need something that does
better for us
that thing is probably a hippo
even though the hippo is uh
a scam
will hold the skunk for the time being
roll a hippo
freeze one apple just in case okay
you only buff level twos and beyond i
don't see it happening this is what we
were looking for it was a pair
i think it has to be done
garlic on hippo could be big
this would be a big win we we should
start running into some scary teams here
though
that kangaroo is is quite spicy
skunk you never know that might be
relevant okay
we don't live
in peace
level three and you peace you're also a
piece
in my opinion
yeah we we lose this one i mean that's
just a that's a nasty team that team's
that team's going somewhere
four wins come on this is start making
some plays man
i'm investing
i got no qualms about investing in a
hippo
freeze me
can me this is this is the play that's
gonna bother you okay can me to make a
kangaroo
pop off a little faster buying the hippo
next time if we lose this round it
doesn't matter but i believe i believe
we can make the rounds all we need is
our hippo to if our hippo kills one unit
i'm happy as long as it lives
oh that's a that's a heavy you piece
moment right there
probably chalk this one up to the
doubters again
dude the level two dodo so early okay
doubters
take your money and run
we're running into i mean dude let me be
honest even if we had a kangaroo we were
getting one tapped by that team so
that's that's not a surprise we got
another four point run in there
community is getting better for one but
also like we need some of those scaling
units early that's that's the meta right
now also the meta right now
this early
i don't mind
the bumbling streamers also known as the
dry ears also known as the bumbling
streamers
frida plays pretty cracked these days
people are very strange these days
this looks like a loss
yeah
okay
feed me by one hp losing the otters is
is kind of nasty
but there's not a whole lot you can i
mean you're you're beholden to the
to the run you get there
that's an acceptable juice the fish is
also important
freeze me
roll me
this is fine
we'll freeze you so we can make a nice
unit next turn we'll put a b on our fish
the fish will likely stick around for a
certain amount of time
it's a scary team as well
but we trade
we
kill you we trade
which is very bad for you
then you died in my freaking beat there
we go there's a win
these are big combination strats
into an ox an ox does really well
behind a cricket also it gets buffed
right off the bed
you know if we play our cards right
no you no be on cricket that's not the
play i think you can freeze some meat
and roll me
i'm not an enormous fan of uh
of the peacock anymore i think you can
go meet
on cricket
hey you know what it killed that tanky
beaver at the start that's well worth
the three gold even if we end up selling
it soon
we get nice buffs thank you so much
and then we go down against two one one
horses these are easy wins
we need to do something about our back
line for sure like like some scaling
would be nice
here are you honestly at this point you
could sell a horse the otter's got to go
too don't get me wrong i think you can
freeze an elephant
and put it at the back as kind of like
some ballast
i'm just thinking
i'm just thinking
pill spider
is an option
as honestly like we basically could not
ask for more
we're gonna try to scale the ox
i think you're very sellable you're
playable
and for the time being i'm actually a
big believer in like
investing in some units that are likely
to stick around for a little bit here
meat on giraffe will be good too but i
think the meat i like having meat on a
tankier unit whenever possible because
they stick around
you know they they're more likely to
survive a hit and get
get those plays
this cricket is freaking cracked mind
you we have some problems coming with
this pig
that's that's true pilling units in
front of the ox is a really
good strategy
to get um
permanent buff plus melon armor
there's three wins
well we'll buy an aux
we'll roll
i do like a turtle um i feel like we
sell fish now and roll kangaroo behind
the ox where it's liable to get some
okay buffs
now the giraffe buffs the kangaroo
instead
i accept this
it's part of the cost of doing business
we're probably gonna kill an elephant in
front of you
dodo can be really strong too i just
don't know if it also fits with the
giraffe i think
i think for now
we toss you this beautiful buff
giraffe is good now um
you know what did i give it in the tier
list yesterday
oh that's true i didn't even think about
that you obviously you would have the
giraffe behind the dodo so the dodo
buffs the units in front instead i was
thinking like uh a dodo buffing a
giraffe what's the point
this is fine we're definitely gonna
we're gonna trade with the fish no we're
gonna kill the fish and the dodo
and the swan look at that
garlic is in one hour ten minutes
it's on the horizon datara bullets
okay so this is a
pill me
oh baby
roll me
have the giraffe buff the dodo
invest in
freeze me
buy garlic for the kangaroo
roll me freeze me
roll me
beautiful
absolutely this is
if you're a believer i would feel pretty
decent right now first not for 10 wins
but for six wins this is looking like an
okay squad that doesn't mean we're gonna
win every game
i'm just saying
we we've actually for the first time
we actually have a squad that appears
like it has a chance to go
a distance maybe not the distance but a
distance
owned
owned
and owned okay
penguin is is just not quite there it'll
just buff our ox if we sell the cricket
which is the problem
rhino instead of cricket though is kind
of pog city um i think we can add we can
run a rhino
even with like a b on it to approximate
the effect of this hey
wait viz thank you so much for the
gifted subscriptions one for each sell
me
can me
by me
followed by a by me
now now this is a squad
we need level two dodo is a big actually
level three dodo is a big part of this
as well
seven eight rhino gets absolutely
crapped on first
we only trade with the fish which is
pretty bad
but then i'm looking at this and i'm
like i think our kangaroo does some okay
work with the garlic armor
no we do much better than trade what was
i talking about
the ox is going to town man that's a win
i clearly do not know math
look at that
we don't really want to sell anything to
get a pill meta going here
i wish there was like a reserve right oh
we're at six wins already look at that i
wish you could go like you know put the
rhino on the roster buy uh an otter pill
it etc etc to to buff the crap out of
this guy
or let me think you know what
screw it man i think i'm willing to sack
a rhino
i i do
to get watch this he's losing his mind
these don't give you a benefit on cell
except to make another
hold on freeze me
he's lost it
donkey dunk
that donkey donkey dunk dunk
i mean to be honest i'm like
sell sell a duck
pillow duck sell this hella duck
well sell duck
roll
once freeze you just in case roll once
buy a deer okay that's so much better
and we'll just save the pill for when we
want to use it on the deer oh my god
that's just like the the greatest
accidental role you could get
even then it's a little spicy there's a
spicy dog up at the front
it's okay we got a bus that does some
damage to the fish behind we're buffing
our ox that's what we like to see as if
we trade with the ox and get to attack
twice our kangaroo is going to go off
man
and by go off i mean losing me okay that
one's a loss
i see it sorry it happens
now
this is a
pill me
thank you so much
and then i think is a sell me
but we got to figure out what's
happening at the front if we're going to
roll this
because like rooster is great don't get
me wrong but how we buffing it we need
we the dodo is like it's it's screwing
us right now
and what are we buffing with the monkey
because we don't really want to muff
buff the bus it's it's a i know it
worked for justin once it's like it's
not a long-term strategy
i think this is a role you can be mad if
you want
i understand the madness
i think we can afford a placeholder
monkey just for now i know this is not
how it looks like it should work with
the ox but
just chill okay
freeze me cupcake me i know it's weird
it's weird
it's weird
sometimes you build against the meta
okay but you you just temporarily for
scaling purposes
this seems like a big get for us
it's a big hit
that's a big hit
you know we're killing that peacock no
matter what we're killing that's a
beautiful get
this is why look i know they on super r
super auto pits they won't tell you that
you can sometimes play an ox at the
front
in this situation we made the right move
the scaling continues although slowly
now you
give two friends ahead so now you're
also buffing the kangaroo which i like
to see
as long as you start with the melon
armor i'm not really stressing i'm
honest like i'm let's build anti-meta
we're building anti-meta right now
cow obviously
you know like used to
sell the kangaroo by the cow buff the
dodo
we need the kangaroo to scale better it
needs to get to level two if it's not
gonna get to level two then it has no
reason to exist right now
ergo get out of my [ __ ] face
see you in hell
you peace
thanks for the malk
scale me
scale me
buff me
buff me
i fully expect just for the record
i fully expect this round to have a high
percentage to lose
but
it might not
that's only a level one flamingo
i'm not sweating that
we punched through nicely now you're
weak as hell
we kill you
you're so freaking lucky you've got
melon armor whatever we still kill you
nice melon armor
this is draw
that's fine this is fine man
beauty
cow goes to the front
gets pilled
hippo's interesting i've been thinking
about hippo
because we can scale it with the monkey
but like with two hp i feel like we're
getting a little late in the game
rat me oh come on now
i think we can try
then we'd have to set it up like that
and we we really want to buff the hp on
the hippo so i feel like we freeze you
sell the
probably freeze you sell the giraffe
in the well we could even do it right
now
sell the giraffe
buy the cow
get you popping
i think this is our best chance to to
scale to 10.
it's got to be a big move like we
couldn't if we just wrote out what we
had there i think we were going down
this is very nice our first melon armor
does lovely work for us
then you summon something that's uh i
mean obviously that's bad then you
summon something that does like
well more damage than i thought honestly
you're gonna kill me
but then we're gonna get you good with
this melon armor right here this looks
okay but then you're gonna summon a deer
and it's a level two deer which is then
gonna summon a bus i think this is a
loss you know what you gotta great
sustain
great sustain on this build
more power to you
it had to be done there a piece no doubt
about it
i i stand by the decision we made
now we're just we're kind of hoping for
the best
sell me
and to be honest a gorilla can be pretty
good i'm going to throw a freeze in
there just just in case
fly is it it's great it's not the right
time
buy me
freeze me
salad me
i'm not optimistic about this gorilla's
chances but
[Laughter]
let's see
please please weak enemy at the front
you know i don't see a horse
this looks like a great build for a
hippo to run into hey kratom khan thank
you for the gifted subs as well
one for each enemy that this hippo is
going to destroy
guaranteed
here it comes
please
please i just
i would love to one tap the kangaroo
oh you're a huge piece you're so
freaking lucky i think we still come out
of this smelling like a rose but it was
a little dangerous that kangaroo was
quite nasty
still got it that's eight wins
you gotta go level two hippo even over
the monkey
freeze me
apple me i know it seems like we should
put it on the dodo but
um i want the hp more than anything else
dude the freaking uh
the the fact that we have a level one
dodo is just is pissing me off honestly
i'm just gonna tell you it's pissing me
off
level two chicken a little dangerous but
it creates a bunch of weak enemies
i mean not weak in terms of their power
weak in terms of their hp
this is another win man we're going to
nine
that's kind of incredible
it's a nine win round right here
um
i feel like you like you definitely at
this point get rid of the scaling from
the monkey the dodo is also like
irrelevant the time is not right so you
freeze the one up hoping for like a a
mammoth or something or a tiger
now the tiger has a lot of interesting
ramifications
you definitely roll it behind the
man if only we could get a level two
dodo
it will help the hippo scale better
but
it does really i think it does really
well behind the dodo even
people are like if only like i know i
rolled past one uh if i had infinite
resources sure do you this is where uh
all right never mind um
okay hold on now
now we got plays
unfor on no keep me frozen
this is now
this is very interesting
i'm just checking i'm like i don't
really want a gorilla at the back
there's no other great place for him
this is this is how we roll
that looks good that this
look okay this kangaroo is gonna eat
good
but i see a little bit of a white weenie
deck here and i say to myself pog
this hippo's got some scaling
it killed the whale through melon armor
level two deer lets us scale
10 10 bus we lived we died
but the ox lived with some melon armor
so it kills the kangaroo
we draw
[Laughter]
i thought we had it
it's fine we're scaling we don't care
tiger does not level unfortunately um
what we do want to do is we probably
want to sell
the gorilla
for something else but nothing else
functions right now
no
double tiger unfortunately doesn't work
i mean in theory i guess you could sell
a
monkey and put a tiger behind the hippo
then you wouldn't get the dodo effect on
the hippo
unless you move the ox out of there
you know hold on let's think about this
for a second
what have you reconfigured it
no because you need this well you want
the double dodo effect more than
anything else
i'm i think this is bad
genuinely the dodo or not the dodo sorry
in this uh
game
you need
to have the ability to punch through
melon armor the only way we do that is
via
this right here so i wish we hadn't
bought the tiger but life goes on
roll me
you peace come on now
you know you could totally just roll a
scorpion at the front
absolutely nothing wrong with that to
get like a one for one trade hopefully
on their
on their uh
strongest unit
and then like a one up on the scorpion
no because that'll replace the
peanut
[Laughter]
it's an interesting idea though and then
that's that's all we got right there all
right let's give it a shot
maybe
i like i like the way it looks so far
you're a piece
purged my melon armor you piece
i lived but we're not gonna live through
this the steak holy crap
we have melon armor once which means
dude i think we
you peace
it's okay it was a it was a good run
that was a great team and a well played
chili pepper
that's still a nine win marty i'll i'll
take that that was especially people
didn't believe in that that was the one
that started with the duck build
people were like my points my points
okay slash market is



points my points
okay slash marker that's sap one being
done we're gonna start another
prediction and run it back i've been
running some some meme builds lately man
like uh
i've been uh
i've been running a lot of just like
tiered level two tier one units plus a
penguin and then just hitting n turn and
turn and turn and turn
and you know you end up you get to turn
11 and you have like
four
pardon me like four uh
35 35 units and no matter what they do
it doesn't matter
you're not gonna love this i'm kind of
like throwing around one here i'm gonna
leave my fish on the bench
this is so funny
hey multi-functional thank you as well
for the gifted subscriptions thank you
um we'll be the comedic chunks because
it rhymes thank you again uh
one for each
half of one win we're gonna get here
okay
guaranteed
don't shoot my duck
i can live with that
i
i think we draw
how how spooky is that we did not
deserve it
you know what i mean by rhyme
alliteration
same difference big freaking whoop
this is a
sell me
and then a big time
buy me
a big time buy me
a big time buy me
roll me
freeze me freeze i know it
sell me
by me
freeze me
this fish
is gonna
is gonna [ __ ]
[Laughter]
and remember the fish when it levels it
levels up everything well it gives plus
one plus one to everything on this on
the squad
squad goals we might lose this round i
don't care about round two we haven't
even we have nothing set in stone on
round two
i think we draw anyway so no no sweat
look at that a draw is a huge win for us
here
calm down there guillermo del toro plus
two i'm gonna rarely do i get the chance
to plus two chat i'm gonna give chat a
nice little plus two for that one
this might cause our squad to not be
full but
i sleep
scale my fish please
giraffe
honestly
send them
roll me i don't care for a flamingo man
overrated and churlish
that's what we're [ __ ] looking for
that's what we're [ __ ] looking for
level three fish incoming
and you get two levels up because you
create a level two
and then you turn it into a level three
you get two levels up are you listening
are you hearing the words that are
coming out of my mouth
okay you're a piece but i'm telling you
watch this watch this
here's how you play this don't be an
idiot okay
i know we're gonna miss a buff on this
it's acceptable to miss the buff to get
a higher tier unit
we do care for you
freeze him for a second
combine me
swallow the ant
we're going to add one more giraffe in
here for the time being
keep that pill frozen roll me
sleep me
question mark question mark question
mark oh lewis hamilton cut the curb a
little bit uh f-i-a-f-i-a lewis hamilton
cut the curb a little bit
won't somebody tell him lewis hamilton
cut the curve oh he just he just won
again he just won another race
they should really hire me as an f1
driver i would i could be lewis hamilton
i saw how he cut the curb on that one
you know nothing's punching through this
11 12 fish prepare yourself
he's an agent for doubters all right
doubt this
oops
oops
easiest win of my life
now
this is a combine me
it's a thinking man's game right now
nl's an agent of the doubters
so true
[Laughter]
so true
um
yeah this looks solid let's keep it here
rigged rigged rigged fia excuse me
fia lewis hamilton's car is faster than
mine
oops
oops
it is a nasty little hedgehog at the
back there i'll give you that
it's not going to matter but i'll give
you that
this is what happens when you got the
devs in your dms
i mean three dodos right off the bat is
that's that's a big hit man that's a big
hit
probably not going to need this anytime
soon so basically um we know we're
replacing the ant in a second
we sell the fish
because the bison will scale beautifully
it'll take a couple turns to get there
the fishes are level three
pill this son of a gun regardless
okay in that case we roll
changes everything
roll me we need two good units this is
this is functional maybe not
for good
it's functional for now this is runnable
here i know we just peeled one
i gotta be honest with you uh i feel
like believe it or not even though this
makes the whale look like pure [ __ ]
the sheep does better to enable the
kangaroo so this is a bit of a disaster
but just give it a second
i'm telling you i i remember when we saw
a whale at the front uh like four rounds
ago what did i say to you what words did
i say to you i said sometimes it works
some just do it a circumstance obviously
if you fantasy drafted
your team you would not build around
this
but for the purposes at our present
disposal it may prove
advantageous
go we needed that
so get owned
get owned
wake up honey we're throwing
so true
so true third win in a row
i don't see why we wouldn't
we do have to figure this situation out
okay so what a turkey definitely can
function here um
and we pivot bit by bit the whale goes
but then we no this is tough
this is a tough one okay
because we don't want to play the sheep
at the front
if possible but we don't have any other
unit that does better the sheep the
sheep at the front
is not great
eat the kangaroo
i think long term that happens
short term i don't know
but you know what sure okay i'm
yeah all right i'm willing
and then
we do roll that regardless
i've learned the error of my ways
the error of my place
probably we end up rolling a rooster
here at some point
probably just instead of a whale right
now
but we don't have the money to do it
acceptable
all we need is a uh we need a fly
uh we need well
i was gonna say move the dodo but no i
actually like the dodo here even though
it sucks that it uh buffs the sheep
i want the giraffe to buff the dodo so
that when we get into our late game
build the dodo buffs the things it needs
to buff
we would rather have the giraffe buff
the dodo than the dodo buff the giraffe
dodo third is wasted stats yeah but we
want the giraffe to buff the dodo
because then it gets permanent stats
that when we stop wasting them
they're gonna pop
and there's gonna be carnage you're a
piece honestly you're a piece
we're still making it
there we go okay we're gonna hold this
rooster for the time no we're not we're
gonna we're gonna we're gonna kick you
out we're gonna roll like that even
though this looks junk right now just i
promise it's not
this is this is now great
now a camel can work here but
it's not really the right time yet this
is more like a uh
we're looking for statistics we're
looking for stats
that's a
stat probably you apply it to the dodo
monkey is is too late it's too little
too late
well not my favorite rolls
this is still good though
you're going to look at it right now
you're going to be like it's not that
strong
just let it let it percolate on you for
a second see if you feel the same way
seems okay
we knew this was coming as long as you
punch through the blowfish right after
we ain't sweating it because we got a 16
one right there
very more than happy to trade for you
right here
not quite killing you in one
i'll settle for two
it takes us to win number five nl's an
agent of the doubters by the way
second turkey is a no-brainer
can not that relevant yet
obviously like if we combine the turkeys
when we get like a fly we'll feel a
little differently about oh i'll tell
you i'll be honest with you now like if
we got nothing else to spend the money
on we'll roll it
it's the same squad
they are a little spooky
uh and in fact that deer if there was a
whale there we would have been in a
rough spot as is don't shoot my sheep
you mother
that costs us slightly
more than i'd like but
nonetheless because we icy we are this
easy ice easy ice things went as well
for you as they could have possibly gone
and yet still
we got you
we still gotcha
there you go believers win
sorry sorry to all the believers that i
was an agent of doubters on this one i
apologize
that's my bad i shouldn't have
allied myself with the doubters like
that
this is fine the squad is fine um
i'm not i'm not a giraffe for cow
individual i'm enjoying the buff into
the buff here i think that's that's
doing great
i think we can totally do this
i think we can totally roll once
i think we can totally roll twice
you're tempting me
now
the chicken does not need to spit out
two chicks yet
it's better for the turkey to buff we
need to work around our positioning here
in order to make the rooster pop better
freeze me though i mean come on you're
still gonna freeze me like
that's a gimme
well think about how we're gonna do this
from the from this point onwards
this is a spicy start here
but i think as long as we trade oh no no
no because of that yeah the freaking
rhino
ah you peace your bees level two rhino
let my turkey pop let my turkey pop
first man
how dare you
how honestly how dare you man
that the rhino hard counters us it's
fine it happens
weenie counter build it's just a nice
just a nice rhino quite frankly
can't be too upset
i think we are looking
to
sell our giraffe
in order to be able to move the rooster
to a better place
but we're mostly hoping to replace it
with
a tiger or a fly for now we can work we
don't need to sell and then just throw
like an ox in
we're looking for tigers
we're looking for flies
um
just to be straight up with you a
penguin up at the front just to get some
stats temporarily seems totally fine to
me
sell me
buy me
run me up at the front because we don't
care for you
then level me
roll me
dude honestly a one up on this sheep is
gonna slap
it's this is what you need
so
we will
presumably
be dumping
the penguin and then thinking about our
order
in order to roll a tiger behind our
turkey
yes
absolutely
i i have place
it's to start kind of unimpressive what
are the what are the question marks for
you don't need two tigers
same people who want two tigers they're
like the same kind of people who are
like if j owing once a day is great then
j owing twice a day is gonna be amazing
it's not it carries deleterious effects
due to its scaling okay
sometimes there's a magic number for
things and if one is good two can be
worse
you can get diminishing returns
now this is good
the penguin is gone
he's going bye-bye
well let me think
we need the roll tiger behind the
problem here okay it's a flow chart
the tiger needs to go behind the turkey
full stop however that pushes the
rooster to the front which makes the
rooster worse okay so maybe you put the
rooster back then it puts the sheep at
the front which makes the sheep worse
okay that's also bad maybe put a dodo at
the front then the dodo has no reason to
exist so what that means to me is that
you probably end up cutting the dodo
even though it carries a steep cost to
cut the dodo i think it's worth it for
positioning so i think you sell the dodo
first
as as strange as it sounds
even the server was like are you sure
the tiger goes here the penguin stays
for now because they're giving stats
then
the sheep gets a one up
well hold on
two chicks two four four rams
the rooster gets a one up
because we get the double turkey spam
build i respect it
yeah
yeah the double turkey spam build will
still work for us here we're gonna look
for another one up for that sheep next
not necessary but if we're not doing
anything else then sure why not i mean
if we get you to level two at least the
penguin will scale you
this is good
it's a nasty team by the way that we're
running up against here
nice try
not the not the tiger thank you as long
as the blowfish dies early we ain't
sweating it
rooster needs third row oh you peace
i don't think oh yeah it does because
the tiger died and we have it only
spawned because the tiger died we have a
one up i understand you're right you're
right you're right
okay don't shoot my don't shoot my chick
owens
the turkey's gotta live man
the turkey's gotta live
that's all i ask from you
we lose instead of a draw we lose by one
hp are you kidding me
so close
now i mean you
no matter what how you do this you're
not gonna like the order
it kind of had to be done
um
honestly you're going to laugh but the
we don't really in my opinion we don't
need a one-up on the tiger we just ran
into like the ultimate sniping builds if
we don't run into snakes we already have
great anti like crocodile and dolphin
technology that's not a that's not a
huge problem
i think you can freeze the stake we're
looking for a stronger unit to go here
if possible
the hippo is way too late it's not even
in the contest it's not even it's not
even up for negotiation
look
why would i get a plus 20 attack when i
can just get plus two plus two on this
guy thanks to a unit we don't even want
to keep anyway
we will freeze that though
okay we're scaling a loss is a win
because we're scaling
uh the crocodile i do not fear
see
we already had the equivalent of melon
armor there
now this ant is a little spicy
this seems okay
this this seems okay
all i'm asking okay because people are
like you you're you're wasting one of
the roosters
we have to either waste a rooster
or a chick
or or a sheep i should say
because otherwise we need to move them
both so they're before position two
or after position two so what do we do
we put a turkey up at the front i don't
think so
seems unlikely
or run four animals
selling the unit at the front does not
move the rooster back
doesn't make any sense
i just i'm merely asking for for thought
now i do think this anti-snipe
technology
matters
so here's the thing
you're like oh get a mammoth because the
mammoth is gonna give plus two plus two
to everything when it dies yeah but we
also have a penguin that gives plus two
plus two to everything
at the end of its turn and then also
gets to attack after
oh plus one you're right it is plus one
plus one
i still i prefer the penguin on this one
for now i don't think that
five nine
i i prefer the straight up i prefer the
penguin i think i think a penguin
steak
the d i think it splits the difference i
don't think you need gar you know here's
the thing i don't think garlic on the
tiger is good but it's better than
spending three gold on nothing
yeah penguin is is permanent
the uh
the mammoth is only for that battle
this one looks a little dangerous don't
get me wrong
there's two fights left yeah but like
the mammoth is is not better it's just
like
i think it's actually probably
mathematically worse
than a penguin with steak on it for sure
plus like we won so [ __ ] you
eat it you know like easy win
okay
just show your show your hands off keep
your brain pogging okay it's
entertainment
this is why they don't have they have
the media in to ask the coach questions
after games
they don't have fans come in and be like
why did elias miss the net on that shot
in the third period
because it's [ __ ] hard okay and in
every every everything you see here is a
choice these are all choices it's a
complicated matrix of problems we're
going to have disagreements and again
the position that you get to be in as a
viewer is if he does something i
wouldn't have done and it didn't work he
should have done what i would have done
because then it would it could have
worked so it's like mathematically
better so you know what take read
between the lines take one of those
okay hold on
now we don't need
i i don't buy one up tiger because
here's the thing if we get if if it gets
sniped it needs to get sniped by a lot
i don't fear this
i don't fear this i don't respect it
okay
we're walking through spaces okay
i think you can sell the penguin
i do think you can i think you could
roll the penguin as well and just buy
two sushis
the problem with our fly
is that if we the fly needs to be close
to the back in order to get the benefit
okay we probably want it at the very
back because we don't want the tiger to
buff the fly is there's not enough room
for what we want to do so instead we
would roll fly
tiger turkey we can't move the turkey
further up which means we're going to be
losing probably like almost half of our
units just by playing rooster and sheep
up at the front
so
i actually think you don't buy fly
i think you buy one sushi
freeze one sushi roll once
and buy the other sushi
i just don't there's just not enough
space for the fly it it's again it's
reaching like
you know you're over filling the soda
cup with dr pepper and then you got
sticky hands we may lose
i don't think it's it would be a loss as
a result of the fly
this is this is an interesting uh
is a spice build here we got a
we got spam
versus depth like this shark is a little
spooky
they don't have a turkey though
our sheep are gonna have to do a lot of
work
like a lot of work
the shark can only get to 50 50.
mind you that's probably good enough
as long as we're not dying there that's
okay
we smack we get three pretty nice units
it takes oh oh oh
hold on
can't help but feel like it appears
we're probably going to come out with a
win on this one
and
he's basically testing
the fly strategy against us so there's
10 wins
sorry for sorry for being an agent of
the doubters
turns out fly good unit sheep a little
bit better
it's just better
probably uh pay out the believers on
that one happy to see 58 of the audience
on the right side of history
then we can roll one more back we don't
have time for all the academia this time
we pretty much we gotta roll quickly
because we got guarded coming after that
donkey donkey donkey dunk okay i gotta
get myself back in a tier one mindset
oh you know
well let's stick with free to play while
we're here okay
fish is good i mean this this is a just
buyable shop quite frankly
fish at the front though with no ants
roll me once ooh
freeze the okay you're not you're gonna
hate me in round two just think of that
before you before you bet
you're gonna absolutely hate me in round
two and then i'm gonna win and you're
gonna be like it was luck get ready
ant at the back it's an interesting
strat not necessarily bad just
interesting this is a draw
smooth heads is a great name it's so
good
[Laughter]
okay here's why you're gonna be mad
buy me
you're not going to be around me in
round two you're going to be mad at me
in round three
roll me get an ant
you peace
might as well honestly
and i want both fish frozen i think
i'm not messing with you i think it is
possible we will have two units on round
three
the the
flip side
is that
they're gonna be two nice units
this is fine wrong whole slayer 69 what
what a name man
what a name
okay
i know the fish buffs the whole board
it's got to be done
i never had a choice
that's that's worth going in for man
sell me
everyone's like don't do it don't do it
reconsider
read some litter to run the subject you
sure
frick it
okay
we like this
we like this
we like this
no we do okay come on don't be don't be
stupid
just buy just freeze yourself a little
crab
roll it
you can do this
what is he doing
i don't know what's going on and i'm
scared
[Laughter]
oh
okay
this this kangaroo is the is the straw
that stirs the drink i don't know what
that means but people say it from time
to time
that's pretty nasty that's a little
nasty
do they macros people say it many people
are saying this
i don't want to say i i told you so
[Laughter]
he won i'm telling you you gotta you
gotta work on your strategies gamers
so-called gamers
roll me once
sell the crap out of me
i love a sell me man
that's a freaking buy me
what what are you doing
it's a freeze me roll me
you peace that's a by me
oh
yeah that's the thing man i you know
what super auto pence is kind of like
it's in a position right now where it
reminds me a little bit of the the game
known as chess
people are like you know they watch me
play and they're like hey
uh
on turn six you deviated from the nydorf
uh dragon in the sicilian defense and
i'm like yeah and then i won the game
with an absolutely
soul-crushing sacrifice what's your elo
by the way and they're like 600 i spend
12 hours a day
watching uh gotham chess videos on
youtube
sometimes you got to use your
problem-solving skills in the moment
in order to make solutions okay
it's not always about memorization
that's a sell me
honestly like if you're going meme
me me
me me
i do like a turtle but roll me
no it can't be done
huge freeze
unless
unless
i'm not sweating
i'm not sweating this man
nice melon armor it'd be a shame if it
got popped by a freaking bee that didn't
do anything be a shame if you got owned
be a shame if you got owned
be a shame if you got owned
okay wow what a horse oh whoa a horse
okay what do we have two wins two wins
all right this is a weird one this is
not a common build okay giraffe has no
reason to exist anymore
that's a buy me that's a sell me
that's a buy me
camel camel
but hold on if you're gonna do a camel
you should definitely buy me sell me a
little buy a little cell
and then you should definitely duck me
twins basil buy me sell me
camel me
for now i still like this believe it or
not but
you ducked my camel
[Laughter]
hey did you just touch my hiney
that's fine
i'm not even upset
all right this one it looks moderately
spiced
however
our kangaroo is a slapper
we don't we do die on this [ __ ] but then
we go up against a bunch of garbage i
think this is this is uh this is a this
is a win look at that easy win
shrimp wins again
uh
by me
we're reworking the whole freaking run
okay
this is a huge sell me opportunity
this is a
sell me
rhinome
dodomi
absolutely
garlic me
and then a roll me
probably a can is a freeze here
and then a freeze
and then a freeze
we do have a 413 kangaroo due to our
cell builds
no no tankiness we want to see no
tankiness up at the front
huge plays the rhino's going off you
ready for this whatever we don't catch
the shrimp it's too late you really
think i would have told you my shrimp
oh never mind if it hadn't already been
put into action
many minutes ago this is probably a loss
let's just be real that that i wasn't
paying attention to the numbers mason
eat it
i don't know man our kangaroos kind of
gonna pop
i know that we got a ton of whales
popping out of the woodworks in a second
here but
i think this is this is a draw man
uh never mind i was wrong uh wait no
okay it's a draw
never mind it's a loss
by one
you piece read between the lines on that
one
good dog
congrats congrats you have a good dog or
whatever fish has got to go it's too
late you fell off
sell me
buy me
monkey me
honestly you need the tankiness more
than anything else you need the
tankiness here even though it's only one
you need the tankiness
i'll check on the remind me to check on
the golden poop hat after this the this
blowfish shark holy crap like you at
least if you're going to roll a a
an early blowfish like this at least
have the good sense
to uh
you piece
not be on a guest account like come on
like at least log in so you can
you know enshral that run in the annals
of history
sell your shrimp
how about you sell your shrimp
freeze me cupcake me this is a very
important moment for the cupcake
1415 rhino is about to frickin blow you
away man
explode into space double peacock build
owns
owns
owns now i will admit we are about to
get on but that was still a pretty nice
start there
um
it still looks like a loss man
the peacock is just too strong
yeah
who would have thought your your cow
could have done it
losing to a cow hurts the most well
anyway we'll pay out the doubters on
that one
solid shrimp buy a shrimp get another
shrimp
that was a fast one slash



hey everybody welcome back
it's nine well it's it let's give me
some credit i'm at work early it's 8 52
a.m
on a tuesday
after thanksgiving
atmospheric pressure i don't know feels
normal cold as heck though it's seven
degrees celsius today
that's not that cold in like a broad
sense
like you know you could get that that's
like
warmer than your refrigerator for
example
um
but when you consider that it's like the
second week of october and we had a 40
degree celsius heat wave like two months
ago is a little surprising we got the
heavier shirts on today
um
playing some super auto pits i gotta let
you know i i played a little on my phone
last night i got a 10 win marty i went
10-3
with a stacked hippo
a level two rooster
with a tiger behind
a dog that was just like chilling he was
just a vestige of an earlier time
i can't remember what we had in position
two
he was doing something though he was
doing some kind of work but it just goes
to show you you know
a hippo is is good enough
i'm stupid i'll be the fatherly um i'll
be the uncertain astronauts it's just a
good name now if you go real quick
you might be able to get that because i
wasted a gold okay
the expected value of one re-roll when
you have one gold left is not that high
but it's like the thought that counts
this is a loss no it's a win no it's a
tie
it's a win let's go
i don't know how to do math
um
that's fine it's fine man i don't i
think it's a good idea to buy a beaver
that way we we sell it back next time we
get some yield this is like a gimme um i
i think it it comes down to whether you
want to lose this round or uh
at the
reward of putting yourself in a great
position for the future i think that's
what i'm gonna do um so
my general principle here when we're
full up okay the duck is to
here's how it goes okay next turn
we combine our fish we're gonna get em
the fish is going to become a level two
it's gonna go across the board give
everybody a nice buff we're gonna sell
our duck our tier three unit
that we unlock is then gonna be plus one
plus one which is very good that's
that's a bit of a force multiplier if
you will um we're gonna give you
an apple because we have nothing
else to do right now really
uh and and we're gonna recognize that
this is a higher chance of losing this
round for a better chance to be well
positioned from this point onwards
we kind of get a two for one
like we got one point nine and then we
kill you
and then you two for one me
i think this is a
i think this is a win would you believe
it it's just the the value of a fish man
it's it's kind of like a nothing unit
but
it does some serious work for you in the
in the in the right circumstances so
we're we're begging
freeze me
for a fish
i'm going as deep as it needs to go we
don't care for these units
at some point if we don't get a fish we
got to start thinking
what the world holds for us and i think
something you can do
you can combine fish
buy a shrimp
sell
a duck
buy a peacock
probably place it
i think we want to set it up like this
now
and then roll one more time so i'm not
exactly like thrilled with the way this
went
but we are up 2-0
we didn't get to our level three which
is a bummer but a 2-6 peacock early i
mean it beats a 1-5 peacock nice nice
two-for-one hit the ant hit the ant you
piece let's go
wasted buff
i'm not i'm not worried about the
peacock getting buffed we knew that it
was gonna be strong enough like
regardless now
you i think this is a draw which is
actually
is actually pretty great when you
consider
um that our roles were a disaster
and i believe i'm using the term
appropriately one thing you can do and
it depends how funky you want to get
right so a shrimp when you sell a unit
it gives plus one
hp
to
somebody it depends
how deep you want to go okay i think we
can afford to do this
that's not what we're looking for but it
allows us to roll the shrimp a little
bit more
prodigiously i suppose i think we want
to roll this squad
right here
don't combine them for the love of god
um this is a very weird setup for sure
um but we're we're we kind of skipped
our tier three uh force multiplier this
is bad a seven nine elephant is is
pretty nasty
um
and the ant's not dying early don't buff
the fish behind that's all i ask from
you
okay um this is you know what you hate
to lose to a guest because it's like
they don't even get to maintain their
points but that's you know that's a
nasty squad you respect it
we're gonna buff you like so
this double shrimp build is is spicy i'm
not gonna ever suggest that this is like
a normal way to live your life giraffe
for a nice buff possibly
i'm i'm just genuinely
uh i'm not sold on a blowfish anymore by
the way in fact can i tell you something
well i'm probably gonna buy one right
now but that's only because i'm gonna
sell the fish whoa
to kind of over commit
uh to what we've got going on with our
shrimp build
and i'm telling you like we are okay
this is actually very interesting um we
obviously want that for the future we
obviously want this for the now dodo can
actually be like an insanely top tier
get i love when you have the game on
fast forward in battle it just stays
fast forwarded
um
for the time being at least i'm just
like uh we need to get to a level two
unit this is like the longest i've ever
gone
without getting a unit uh at a higher
level it's it's crazy
this this looks great to me this looks
horrible to me i i did the math
completely incorrectly and didn't
realize we would suffer here uh it's
another loss and it's all fallen apart
and it's falling apart due to
let's call it optimistic shop play
i think this is like we gotta get over
that
um
we want this
i genuinely think we want the dodo to
start getting leveled as well i think
we'll put one of these on
on you first
roll me once i know we didn't stick with
the dodo okay
i know it you know it we all know it
well i hate to say it i think you keep
the dodo frozen and roll a flamingo up
at the front this is a bit strange this
is not
i mean we're two and two now and i i'm
not optimistic but if we could just get
a level two
camel or at least a camel that has some
extra hp like
the the peacock could run freaking wild
man
we're at least getting one peacock buff
this is a bit of a nasty squad
but the the real problem with our squad
is fairly obvious right like if
our peacock dies we have nothing else
that does anything for us at all
the flip side of that is that if it
doesn't die
we are totally fine
and i think you're seeing uh the the
proof of that right here
one peacock did enough to to get us
through there that's only level one
peacock too so
we're at 3-2
and uh
and hopeful for the future i it's like
i'm not trying to be like a butthole
about things but what if you
just hypothetically you know like got me
uh a unit that i already
had seen before in my life
just just
for argument's sake
so there is something to be said for
eating a flamingo but i don't know what
you give up now like the camel is not
great but if we scale it it's got
something admittedly the shrimp's not
doing much i'm kind of looking to sell
the flamingo though
we got one more role in us first i think
are you kidding me like i just
there's only a certain amount of units
in the game
why is it
seemingly impossible
to get the one that i'm looking for well
i think we should focus on
buffing the camel so that it can at
least get some triggers
hopefully um and we're still we're
keeping the dodo in reserve which is not
doing much for us admittedly
well then you're in roll situation
okay that's a huge freeze i i think we
you're gonna laugh at that one but
just work with me okay okay now we're
talking
flamingo
probably gets pilled
beaver gets sold for a nice buff
see they got a very similar build like
their their team is the team that they
told you not to worry about
we actually like the kangaroos gonna be
nasty but the camel is actually getting
multiple triggers for us here which is
insanely good
which means we're gonna one tap this can
we're gonna to tap this kangaroo
no garlic armor on the blowfish i think
that means that we're in
a drawn position and just barely
but now this is where it should start to
have a chance to pop i mean we we we've
been blessed with like good animals
showing up the only problem following
that is like how bad they've been
to when it comes to trying to get to the
next level
so this is like a buy
sell
for a decent extra squeeze there
parrot copies the ability
of the animal in front i actually think
it's kind of horrible for now
um but i do think you can roll
a monkey and then roll one more time
freeze me
uh well i don't know because are we
selling a giraffe at some point maybe
maybe not we're probably selling our
shrimp next just to keep the run kind of
like rolling
um this is still i would call this run
speculative and optimistic
like amazon's projections for how much
james bond's finale no time to die will
make it the american box office
now
that's
a turkey this early is not good for us
but
and i say this
this is a big butt okay
but it really is
once we get through these first couple
of waves here
and then also the sheep
i'm like if we can kill the horse we can
maybe do something seven seven four
i think
you're doing 10 damage each oh because
you got a level three horse
okay now this is where i just get mad
and i'm like okay congrats you got the
meta build hope you're proud of yourself
turkey showed up early
must
wow all skill i mean it's an auto
battler i guess i can't really be upset
but okay we're on our final win
opportunity here
you got you got to start sending and
like you're shrimp scaling i i'm i'm way
too invested in the concept of this
shrimp man like
it's not actually
that good
unless
so a hippo is how i uh
is how i got to a 10 spot last night
but i feel like it it needs to be said
you know that was uh
we had more room to play with than what
we have right now let's put it that way
we're not rolling turkey build hey
there's the fish that i was looking for
in the early game
i'm not thrilled about our current
prospects keep in mind we could sell
this giraffe at some point i like
i i'm
i'm i think we could get to six i think
this is a potential six piece those
crabs are gonna be
that they're setting up for the future
which is great news for me because it
means we're going to get an easy win
right here i also don't know if they
might be on three losses so
at some point we need to have more than
two units that do something like i think
we've done pretty well to get to 500 um
when you consider the fact that we have
two units that don't do anything
or sorry three units that don't really
do anything um
like they're both valuable your tier two
your two tier three it's probably less
likely to find a peacock at this point
um
and a turtle is kind of interesting you
could at some point melon armor will be
better than garlic armor because you'll
be going against enemies that hit hard
enough to kill you regardless
um but i think that uh
for now garlic armor is still superior
we might want to like sell a cow and get
a well select probably sell a giraffe
and get another unit out there but but
not right away we can wait a bit it's an
interesting build here the the flies uh
scare me a bit
but as long as we can hit this level
three sheep i'm not sweating it too much
they don't have like a horse or a turkey
or anything so you are summoning a lot
of flies
uh we don't quite have like a hip like a
hippo would just destroy this build
instead we're uh
we're again pretty much exclusively
relying on our peacock but it's actually
gonna get the job done
and the time has come to start building
out our back line
i don't mind the the monkey and the
giraffe sticking around but the cow
cannot be there
also like one
are we on pay to win i don't think so
right we're on free to play if a bat
hits us we just lose right so you know
playing accordingly
this is possible
we know we're gonna sell a cow
my thinking would be you could also sell
a giraffe because it only gives plus one
plus one
then
you would buy a dragon
excuse me this is like it's all screwed
up
you would follow up your dragon with a
mosquito
which buffs
basically there's your giraffe play
right there you would sell your mosquito
you would buy a cow
you would level up your camel so you get
more hits but also then more triggers on
the peacock you'd roll again freeze
yourself a duck for the future
i'm not saying we got a win here we do
our scaling has gotten better though
we just can't afford to lose uh well a
hippo
am i insane to think this doesn't look
that bad
like you killing your own hippo does not
seem wise to me because then it comes
out with no stats i think that's that's
the worst thing you could do there
lucky us
well from inauspicious beginnings we do
now find ourselves at uh
six wins respectable
to an extent
we're gonna sell you
i mean you know how we roll on this
we're gonna buy
probably buy the duck last we're gonna
buy you
decent we're going to buy you
we're going to sell you
we're going to buy you
we're going to roll you
now
which might be interesting isn't it
probably freeze you no matter what
if we can get a hippo strong enough
do i think it could still pop here
no
and the answer to that question is
almost always yes so i understand how
that probably comes across
um
but i i genuinely i don't i don't i
think it's way too late
it's it would only get
like
plus three plus three every turn maybe
maybe you give it a melon armor it has a
chance
we we gotta level it up
though i hate to say it i mean i guess
it would be plus one plus one to begin
with but though i hate to say it
i do kind of think
well can i tell you what i think i think
you buy sushi here
i think we stick with that duck i know
how stupid that seems we can sell it
next turn to get into a better situation
i didn't want to buy a mammoth and put
it up at the front because i worry about
going up against enemies who get a
trigger on kill like if they have a big
hippo or something like that
well at least we're living through our
first hit here this is a very similar
team
um
r peacock
almost
almost beats them there i think this is
a loss
but i don't think a mammoth would have
changed that maybe i'm maybe i'm
mistaken but
okay we'll run one back here i mean that
that took a while but i'm impressed we
had to puzzle something out there that
we went 6-4
this is this is very good
um i would describe this as a very
strong first shop i would prefer if my
fish got the stats from the otters so
we'll buy that first let's go then we
put the fish up at the front we roll
once double duck
means even if we lose round one you
gotta be the wet mouths man
even if you lose round one a double duck
puts you in an amazing position for
round three and beyond
this is a win i don't even need to i i
can i promise you it's a win
good start i mean it's just the value i
mean you have a 4-4 on round one you
just win the game
um
quack by the way uh quack we want to do
a double cell here
imo
you can invest
you freeze me roll
me freeze me
uh we should have bought an apple
instead but uh it's fine we'll buy
a bee and put it on our unit that's most
likely to survive for a little bit
then i'm thinking i'm like i think we do
it we might i really hope we win this
one so we can throw in round three
that's what i'm that's what i'm getting
at right now because i think we're gonna
want to sell both ducks to make our tier
three unit as strong as possible
and that might make it good enough for a
squad of four to allow us to live but it
also might not
either way we did win this round
we got a little lucky we went up against
another duck build i think but
certainly i can i can live with this and
don't don't get too attached to this
horse man we don't have to i mean it's
nice that we get the option we don't
have to live with it forever right so
give me this give me this
we get a tier 3 camel
i completely stand by what i said a
second ago
this camel getting upgraded to a a four
seven is disgusting uh and then i was
actually wrong because we got the money
from the cell obviously which then
allows us to roll a squad as long as we
don't reroll and and this is
complete no that was good this is
completely fine
this is a very dangerous team to run up
against early
i'm feeling pretty confident for the
time being
we're also pretty close to our next
level up this doesn't look bad for me
this fish is gonna get gross man
this fish is gonna be a menace
pretty much a wasted buff so well maybe
not because they it did allow them to
trade on that one
maybe it's not so bad
man that is there's a nasty team right
there
so we're at 3-0
with a lot of space we basically have
two spaces on the roster we can we can
augment here
um because we do not care
for the otter and we do want to combine
horses so there's something to be said
about running an elephant
uh in front of a camel but i think right
now that's
unnecessary not necessarily bad but
unnecessary
swan is just a it's a pretty strong unit
i would feel comfortable at least having
one in the squad for now
freeze me i think we have an obligation
to go
here
it's exactly what we want
we have to think about what we want to
buff though
and what we want to buff is
uh probably
our camel
which is weird because it means that
we're not getting the buff on our fish
but please keep in mind the camel is
more likely to be a member of this squad
in three rounds than the fishes so we
might as well start investing those
buffs where they belong
four eight peacock
six eight peacock
still dies to our giraffe
i think i think we come out of this one
just fine even though it it looks a
little bad
it's not that bad
look at this i mean i don't even know if
we've had to use our back liner this
whole time
like this this whole run so far and
we're at four wins zero losses which is
pretty amazing you know we want our
camel to go up
you know we want our camel to get one of
these it might be time to sell fish
or horse for that man in fact
probably say horse
then we would
still take our second swan
turtle is just weird because we don't
want it to
override
garlic armor
i think we'll roll a blowfish
um
this is not ideal
probably the best place for it is not
here the best place for it is to get
buffed but i'm really looking for like a
kangaroo to go behind this camel i want
to invest fairly heavily in this camel
um
you know especially every every round
that goes by
the giraffe
plus garlic armor allows us to survive a
hits against white weenie builds and i
look it's uh
it's a funny sentence we all laugh here
we all have a bit of fun
i'm i'm so
i was gonna say i'm so thankful we're
crunching through the hippo there but
actually you know what as long as we
beat the hippo we're fine and that's the
hippo getting beaten
have a slice of that
does suck rb is kind of useless now but
the fish is not long for this world to
begin with
get owned and we're 5-0 man and without
even like the dream squad we've always
wanted
ox can be pretty good
our blowfish is probably not a long-term
uh solution for us
um
so an ox behind a fish is okay but i
also do kind of feel like we want to get
rid of the fish
freeze me for a second we don't have to
make a choice quite yet
definitely i want another giraffe
and then a dodo
um with like a i think we should i i
genuinely think it's the right idea
i think you go for it
because you'd buff two friends and now
things get a little nutty for us
um
i think
because this way our dodo is now getting
buffed every turn which is amazing right
there's something about a crab here also
getting buffed
by getting buffed on the hp but the dodo
needs the buff the fish does not need to
exist
if that's the case
then it's probably
wise to actually buy a dolphin right
away and really the dolphin is just
going to exist
uh to hopefully snipe an annoying unit
at the enemy's back line and then get
sold next turn
it is a 4-6 if things go wrong
i mean we we killed a stake there
i can live with that man
somehow that actually worked out quite
nicely for us
this looks
this looks like a loss
that fish is very strong
honestly more power to you
you build something that it managed to
weather the storm here but i am not
pessimistic about my future chances
really uh
so the peacock was kind of an important
part of the strat here
i think you get sold
i would rather have this one i think a
peacock comes out
we do still want to buff the dodo that's
important because the dodo kicks it
forward
i think we the ox no longer really works
here
although you could ox something and then
play an ox and then kill something in
front of it to get melon armor but
i mean i say butt and that's the
realization that it's like an
interesting play at minimum
[Laughter]
could be good
um
you know
i think given how important scaling is
for
this build right here i do not mind
trying to roll a little something like
this and then like this is weird
i guess i would rather
stat up our no
it's
we want actually you know what we want
double stats on our dodo even at the
cost of our peacock for a round freeze
the garlic armor
yeah because the dodo kicking it forward
is going to be worth more so anytime you
get a chance to invest in the dodo
scaling let me rephrase anytime you get
a chance to invest in scaling the dodo
is probably the right place
so we
live
we die
but
we do kill the kangaroo
um with our peacock
barely
that's very important
and then i think this is a draw i think
your badgers like just strong enough
it's okay i'm not sweating it man that's
that's
that's life
that's life in this mixed up world
give me a combine
give me a uh
give me a garlic
we know we need to buy a unit right
we're not we don't have a tier three
we're unlikely to get one
so we're gonna roll looking for
something better
we're gonna do the same
silly thing we did last time
now our dodo needs to get to level two
the buff on the peacock is nice but the
camel is really our our damage dealer
right now if our camel gets owned early
it's very bad for business
on the bright side the peacock with the
garlic armor lets us live long enough to
do that and then we we trade dodo for
peacock
and we kill the monkey and we live okay
so that that is a a data point it's
merely one data point but it's a data
point that lets me start to think that
we're getting ourselves out here
this is nice as well quite frankly we
can
why am i feeding pears to you instead of
you and
look we can worry about that later give
me some milk mountain goes to dodo
sell me
buy me some milk mount goes to dodo
sell me
we could have done this slightly
differently
no questions there
rhino is kind of interesting
rooster
it's kind of interesting
forgive me i think you gotta roll for
something a little bit deeper
um and you freeze this for now i think
you buy another cow and you just
do one of these um
i understand it's mostly only benefits
our peacock which is not great for us
you know what i'm gonna
if it ain't broke don't fix it roll me
freeze me get a 22-23 dodo when that
hits level two
there's gonna be carnage we we really
need some extra hp on our peacock or
alternatively we need to replace the
peacock with something that's not uh
garbage because it's not
um it's not that bad but it's not doing
very much right now
which is that bad we're lucky our camel
lives but you're gonna shoot
that doesn't change things i think
um
nor does that really i think you know i
just don't shoot my peacock thank you as
long as we're icing you
i think we come out of this just fine
it's really like our level one dodo like
who would have thought that that's the
that's the the the the river that runs
through our whole run as we get to seven
seven wins
sure
i mean you need this
that's
insane
you need this you need this
um then roll me
kangaroo fits
even though it's late
kangaroo
does really well either behind the camel
or behind the peacock
we don't need to think about it for now
all we need to know is we're happy it
exists
this rhino is is oh no wait this rhino
is a large piece
[Laughter]
um
at least it's only a level one rooster
the shark scares the crap out of me
obviously
owns
owns
you continue to be owned but then you're
gonna you're gonna own me
7-4 yeah we don't get you we don't get
you you know what that's a lot of faith
you put in your shark there but it got
the job done
so we're two losses two losses that's
still pretty good
we we need to go up
leopard doesn't need to exist
you need to level up
you need to go
it makes the most sense
i think for the kangaroo to fit in right
here
they're gonna suck for the time being
level level two or even like a level
three on that is big i
definitely feel like we need guar or we
need melon armor on somebody probably
that's that's nice
now there's a so there's the very
interesting run here okay because tiger
um
you can put tiger on
the dodo and spam out a bunch of attack
it's it's really quite interesting and
it you could even just put it behind the
giraffe and it scales but for some
reason i am here not doing that um
i guess i'm i'm over committed to the
existing build this is a loss but
this is a loss because we're just going
up against like the greatest team you've
ever seen
[Laughter]
this is just like the stats are just out
of control
now that you accept that as a loss i
mean one of the reasons i didn't want to
get the tigers because i feel like tiger
plus the scaling stuff is not that uh
valuable for us right now
um
because it's a little late in the game
but
okay um
well
to be honest i kind of feel like our
peacock is not doing what i needed it to
do
instead i'm going to make a very
dangerous pivot here i'm going to sell
our level 2 peacock even though our
kangaroo has proven nothing
i am going to place
a snake
and because you need to live
i'm going to make a gamble
that the melon armor over the garlic is
better and if you have like a 1-1 at the
front then i just cry okay
you peace
it would have it would have hurt because
it was the splash attack but
oh my god no the melon armor was was
good but it also wasn't enough because
your tiger dodo look you're gonna look
at this and be like see that's the power
of tiger dodo yeah their freaking uh
dodo was level three ours is level 1.1
we we did
with i think we batted higher than we
should have batted there quite frankly
that's it was seven wins not bad man i
can live with that for now thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed if you click
the like button helps me out a great
deal of course subscribe you want to see
more in the future thanks for watching
super auto pets i'll see you next time
see ya



annel did you hear that valkrae tweeted
about super auto pets
look i have been wrong about many
predictions in my life okay
i thought the iphone was not going to
take off
i
believe that the avatar sequels are
going to make a lot of money at the box
office
the most confident prediction i have
ever made in my entire life we are still
in the takeoff phase
of super auto pets it's still
early it's still early
it's gonna there's there's a
once i i said this yesterday i think
once all the content creators get there
dow gonna red light green light tug of
war stuff once they get all that out of
the way once they finish making squid
game except it's in real life with your
favorite streamers times
a billion times that's when super auto
pets
comes in and fills the power vacuum
it's the easiest game to get into
of all time
it's cute
people can watch it they know what's
happening right off the bat it's not
like other unscrutable battle royales
that shall not be named
i'm ready for it apollo's gonna check it
out soon the sap pull is too strong then
it goes apollo steven septic
ellen
koji i'm trying i know them all i know
i'm all five up when it goes to five up
then it goes to tommy in it then it goes
from tommy in it to dream and then on
the other side it goes from stephen
septic to hafu and then it goes from
hafu to the the to fusely and then it
goes out to the offline tv house and
then
that's how it goes man him hit me her me
him him me him her me
okay anyway we're ready to get going
here
and we're positioned at the top of the
totem pole
[Laughter]
at least until apollo starts playing um
fish is good otter buffs the fish you
love to see it cricket piece of garbage
nobody cares for it um
second fish freeze me him me him him me
this is a this is a good squad early
dude give me the tropical shirts
thank you uh an anonymous gifter
for
uh a hundred gift subs thank you
[Laughter]
what can you say uh thank you much
appreciated
that's a believer right there
thank you for that gift subs anonymous
an anonymous
thank you
i don't know what to say
appreciate it though moving up to
the the rankings also known as the
leaked personal data um you could you
know what one man's leak is another
man's scoreboard that's what i've always
said
um do you own any hawaiian shirts irl
i don't um i've never been a hawaiian
shirt kind of guy to be honest with you
i don't i don't like wearing a button
here's the thing
i
um my body doesn't hold right now the
things
in the position they're supposed to be i
need a shirt
that locks that in so a hawaiian
shirt very letting it free flow
is not where i want to be
yet
i feel like i i need a shirt that's
tight it's made of
brown shirting fabric and it lock it's
like spanx's things into place
at what age does that start happening
i don't i feel like if i invented the
segway you could wear hawaiian shirts
like palmer lucky the oculus ceo he
probably started wearing hawaiian shirts
when he was like 16 years old
i'm just not there yet i'm not ready
now
um
not my organs
you know it's the just the just the
extra stuff on the top the packaging uh
we got to go faster here okay we don't
need to buy a fish yet but we could we
probably sh we probably should and then
we can just combine later then we roll
i'm not afraid
i think you buy this
that's not what you wanted to see happen
i think you freeze this
and then i think you add a bee to a fish
this is a squad you don't want to roll
up against let me tell you
drip or die i am seriously thinking
about getting some patrick lione
sunglasses
the morpheus meets macho man randy
savage sunglasses
this this squad is nasty man look at
this
okay now
dodo is worth again this is not going to
be
that donkey donkey donkey donkey dunk
okay watch this okay we know we're going
dodo so here's how you start the dodo
train come on ride the train and ride it
you buy this then you get the combine
because it makes your dodo stronger
then you leave that camel there for a
moment
and you do
the combine into a buy we have learned a
valuable lesson the combined into a buy
this is pretty good um
we need to oh we can't really fill our
squad right now that's okay a whale i
think is freezable and a camel is
temporarily playable
and we'll just roll
like this
and we're gonna put an apple on the dodo
oh right that's not how that works
because i knew i'd get a kiss always got
mad when the class was dismissed i had a
10 win game last night by the way and
you know what what worked with my 10 win
game you're gonna laugh
because it's the second time it's
happened in recent memory i just had a
big freaking swan man one one big swan
did
enough
it just it got it it was the same build
that i ran recently it was like a big
swan
uh that had been buffed by a penguin for
like you know 20 turns or something like
that swan me
easy win three wins already are you
seeing this
are you seeing the weight that we win
the game
that we win that game
dire dire docks man i mean how can you
it's it's indisputable
i like it i don't i don't like them i
don't think we need a whale yet we can
get one later
laugh all you want okay
this is a sell me
by me
sell me
i wanted that to hit the dodo buy me
buff me situation
we're investing in some
getting some stats early on
instead of just wasting all of our money
rerolling hey you never know when that
plus one plus one on the dodo could uh
could do it for you nice shot wow level
one mosquito that's gonna do some
serious work said no one ever
is gonna do some nice work level one
level one mesquite
you've got a level one mosquito
i thought their hedgehog was gonna kill
me too
um we're fine
okay um we know we don't want a hedgehog
long term that's okay it's not a buy me
sell me meta it's definitely a by me
meta
it's definitely a buy me meta it's
definitely a
garlic me meta
frees me another garlic it's like so
insanely valuable early i got to be
honest i think you can roll a blowfish
in the position of the swan move the
swan back one camel's gonna make it go
freaking wild
it's a great day to be a believer right
now
nice sweater king thanks i in the mirror
in my eyes i look exactly like chris
evans
just don't ask me to take the sweater
off
owns
no horse equals i i don't sweat this
owns
perfect that's perfect timing
this is an easy win
easiest win i've ever seen
blowfish is a worse hedgehog
source dude just trust me
how about a swan
what's that five wins
five wins okay big whoop um i mean this
is your gimme
uh you know the deer is okay
and i wouldn't say amazing but it's got
some it's got some okay ability
fish is gonna go at some point
giraffes not the play although giraffe
dodo can be fine but
i'm not sold on it just yet spiders
flamingos i sleep we buff a dodo i'm
looking for some dodo man
like we level one dodo needs to go a
step further
now that's nasty luckily we trade with
their fish they have anything going on
after that fish
crab's not too bad
crabs crabs kind of horrible this looks
like a big loss however purge me some
melon armor
and then he gets it right back did you
see that do you see how he gets it right
back
well this is a loss against the wet
turtles the aptly named wet turtles
why give melon armor to the ox dude
honestly you're you're a little you're
sleeping a little bit okay melon armor
on the ox usually is a result of pilling
something in front of the ox which also
gives it an incredible buff
not just the default melon armor but
also like uh
a plus two attack ratio i wouldn't
expect you to understand
for this just in case freeze me
bro give me a dodo you're honestly like
don't be a piece you're kind of a being
a piece right now
this is gonna go ham though get ready
for this
cup that's a cupcake for the believers
it's absolutely true true hey lick my
hand drawn thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
this week are you ready for this
the hippo is gonna go buckwild
this is the perfect build
the milky chunks disgusting name truly
disgusting
uh thanks for the beef i was worried we
would actually die to that ox really
appreciate the bee thanks for your help
are still gonna die to the ox
but it's still pretty good
[Laughter]
all right we can do this look at that
no sweat
even go i'm starting it's like slay the
spire i'm at first people were like are
you going to um
ever play on high speed and i was like i
would never it's impossible to follow
and now i'm like
man
i don't even think i could play on
normal speed anymore it's too slow for
me
now i know i froze the blowfish i'm
actually starting to agree with chat
that for this run
for this run specifically
i don't see the value of that blowfish
yet i think we're going to hold the swan
we're going to hold a camel we could
absolutely
and get ready for a can here
we don't have 12 oh actually we will
have 12 gold uh pear is nice too but
this is a big
this is a big turn for us okay so we're
not going to be able to afford the pair
but everything else is going to slap
get ready for this
okay now this is going to suck
temporarily this
mh gamer is going the distance
[Laughter]
a penguin plus all tier two units or
level two units equals enjoy your win
i'll just yeah go ahead enjoy your win
it's gone they we're not getting that
one you you got the dream
we're actually kind of close to it
ourselves
but we're not quite there yet we know
that's a sell
um let's do our first buy
the only thing that that annoys me is
that the dodo's not there but i i
actually believe
in the penguin i do
i think you can roll penguin even though
the penguin sucks the scaling is going
to get crazy
yeah we should have canned them that's
that's definitely true
unfreeze me i mean we just can next the
penguin
does n the penguin is not an exist
uh it doesn't exist to kill it exists
just for its buff as long as it lives
through the shop then you got nothing to
worry about
get one of the tier sixes tell me you're
a three win marty without telling me
you're a three win marty
three win marty d
okay this is good stuff
freeze cat good one um
oh
tough luck on your worm here ah you
almost had it
geez louise you hate to see it
and then your hippo well i'm you but
stronger uh level two hedgehog
inspires a a moderate amount of oh never
mind we lost okay
just give it a second okay
this is we've invested in our scaling
unfreeze me
unfreeze me
we need a level 2 dodo it's that simple
let's as long as it hits the hippo i'm
happy there we go freeze me you son
buy me
roll me
freeze me
here's our scaling
and now we get to go up against all the
losers like me who have their uh
they're on their last life so we should
be fine
i see big plays i also see trees of
green red roses too
i see a shark
i'm not that afraid of this shark just
yet
the shark it doesn't have many units
that are spawning off of it right now
and our hippos scaling like a son of a
gun
and this this looks beautiful to me
that's a baby shark right there
we almost lived there too
all right so we got to do 13 damage to
you turns out the swan strongest unit in
the game
camel needs more hp you just you got to
believe okay it just takes time
the camel will get there they just need
more hp right now to buff the swan
give me the dodo you piece
come on we have so many rolls
that's that's a a must buy
it's a must buy man keep that pair
frozen
i know the monkey is an interesting idea
you could sell a swan to roll a monkey
you could sell a dodo to roll a monkey
sell them sell the penguin to get a
monkey
why would i want four plus one plus ones
when instead i could just get one plus
two plus two
i mean i'm just going to be honest i
like it as is i think this can still
work
as long as we break even here your snake
doesn't get to pop
let's go we're alive camel actually got
an ability
that doesn't happen too much
that's a big play turkey shark is a
scary build but they're they're in like
two different archetypes right now
i'm not sold on the idea that this is
gonna work for them quite frankly
i think we draw no actually
yeah we draw okay that's fine
because we have amazing scaling that's
dude i saw a turkey and a shark but they
didn't quite have it going on
you you know it and i know it they
didn't quite have it going on this is a
roll me
i i believe in our power right now i i
believe we're reaching the point where
melon will surpass garlic we already
crush a white weeny build which garlic
is the best at defending um
keep rolling me there's we change very
little here
a penguin is worth the buy
i'm not sold on buying a camel when
instead i'll invest in our hippo okay
we get a little stronger every turn we
need that dodo man that
when the level two dodo getting getting
buffed for plus two plus two is insanely
valuable for us okay this is not great
[Laughter]
your hippo your hippo's gonna run wild
on us there's no doubt about it okay
melon armor turtle i can't be mad it did
some work
still believers get paid out
six wins or more we got seven
that's good stuff
cat would have been amazing i understand
like when you lose on turn six every
time every time you see a tier six unit
you go oh my god that's gotta be like
the best unit that's ever existed you
you need to prioritize things based on
where
you're at based on where your opponents
are at there's a whole different there's
a lot of things going on okay
like i was losing it a little bit in the
uh
in the tier list when people are like he
has beaver over cat and you're like well
if on turn one
if if a cat showed up i would buy a 6'5
cat over a beaver for sure but you know
they they don't they show up in the late
game and you're like it's a little late
man
dragon for me is it can be great you
just need the capacity which is hard to
guarantee at that point in the game
now
this is tough okay
horses early can function
but i don't love them but two of them at
least
you know there's something to be and
then i guess
you buy well you could freeze a mosquito
and then roll me that's what we're
looking for forget forget the duck for
now we've already invested
instead we get a fish that comes out and
is mercifully
a 4-3 but i still think you probably
lose round one
the lush bushes
four three fish is good but man a three
four would hit the spot oh man
oh
man lose into a duck round one you hate
to see it but you know what it's we knew
it was likely
or at least possible
i definitely think this is how you roll
this you get a fish out there
you get a cricket out there
you
roll once because if this gets replaced
with a b we'd be okay
this should be a draw at worst
this is an oh this is a a platonic ideal
squad for this team don't shoot my horse
thank you thank you
i'm them but stronger i think
look at that oh we 3-1 trades with a 5-3
now we're talking okay 1-1
this isn't great just to be
honest with you um
i think we can at least roll
this for a second but we definitely wish
to dump this cricket now that it's a one
two instead of a three two
the thinking
i'm thinking okay
sell me
by me
freeze me i i don't mind rolling a 3-2
temporarily
roll me
freeze me unfreeze me
buff me
i accept this then we use we probably
combine horses get ready to sell them
maybe we sell first because they'll sell
for two instead of one
and
we pill the flamingo in order to buff
our dodo permanently
and then all we need to do is on like
last time actually have like a level two
dodo have a chance to show up
this is a draw which is hilarious
no it's a win because the horses will
buff the bee get owned
interesting okay so first this is a cell
so that
we can do
this first okay just get ready now we
get a nice buff it's only for one turn
whatever right then we get a nice
buff then we combine
and you're not long for this world
we
put the whale
behind the flamingo
we'd still get ready to kill you in a
turn or so i think you can add a fish to
this squad that doesn't bother me
i think you might even want to buff that
flamingo we'll see for now two wins i
think three is possible maybe not
guaranteed but possible but hey the
horse is also gonna buff the flamingo
when it comes back out on the second
pass would you look at that
this this squad is gonna be nasty the
the illegal housewives they're gonna be
nasty in a few turns i'm glad we're not
uh fighting them in a few turns i'm glad
we're fighting them now
three one becomes a four one
buffs everybody which means our dodo
will not die in one hit which is insane
which means our dodo actually trades
with the peacock instead of the elephant
you're gonna be scary next year
not this year though
oh baby
[Laughter]
um we could get a level two horse
and it would what turn is this five
that would kick-start us one level up i
mean here's the thing if we buy it for
one we sell it for uh
two so it's a pretty easy it's basically
like getting a small reroll
and then i think we do say get out of my
face
and we probably do
purchase
a dolphin regardless i think it's it's
acceptable to run it
temporarily um
i'm a simple man do just hit me with a
buy me buy me early keep this frozen
might as well freeze that just in case
invest in some stats here
interesting squad
ooh
it still gets to do its effect i think
otherwise that would be that would be
horrible
this seems okay
flamingo
dies for for a cause
and then
it might be a draw i think i think it is
a draw but still
upgrading on flamingo doesn't work
because of whale
it still works
when it dies from being eaten by the
whale it'll give plus two plus two then
it'll come back as a level one and when
it dies give plus one plus one
it works
now the question is
i don't think it's a question i think
this is a guarantee if we're sticking
with the fish for the time being
i think you pill the flamingo buff the
whale
run a deer in front
sadly most of our investment here will
be in rerolls we have nothing else to
really do
we could buy a b but that's not that big
that's pretty good
that's really good
there is you know turtle's interesting
but i i'm just banking on the idea we
could get one later maybe we'll freeze
one of those oh
it's not a piece it's not a piece
it's the opposite it's the whole damn
pie
this build looks like uh a bus is gonna
do some serious work on it
you pie
i'm not too worried about the blowfish
two damage
big whoop
send it
send it
oh man
this is a win for sure dude it's a good
day to believe
and we got space like we can dump the
dolphin no sweat
it's not a can situation just yet you do
one of those now the deer gets stronger
which is not that relevant we could put
the fish in front instead
knowing that the dolphin is going to be
sold at some point
we are going to
keep you frozen
buy a can roll once
i'm happy with the situation we got
i know i know i know
justin did it one time
worm could scale
it's a big investment though
penguin
like
if scales are dodo scales are fish those
are both pretty big
whale might get their revenge you know
what i think you i think you've sold me
i think you've sold me on the
possibility of a penguin
maybe
being functional here
penguin i i reject the notion that i uh
don't respect the penguin my last two
ten spots were with the penguin on uh
on mobile
this is a nasty squad like that that
peacock is mighty strong
but it doesn't get any tankier you know
it just gets uh
it just gets more attack this is a loss
man this is a that's a nasty
it's a nasty build
good god
all right
hey you know what they're doing
something with food build which is very
it's respectable
two lives remain
so i think it's a sell me
buy me
buy me
roll me
buy me
don't i don't have anywhere for you to
fit i wish i did
dump the fish how about you
enough said
i would never the fish is part of our
scaling right now we don't need the
penguin if we don't have the fish i
promise you when this fish gets to like
30 30
i will check your chat history and be
like this is what you get for being a
doubter
i don't like seeing uh oh it's a scampi
build
this is okay with me we've made it
through the the most annoying units
those shrimps at the back are gonna get
cramped on here
this is a win let's go
full scampi
the little crab little crab on top
um keep that frozen we really want the
level 2 whale
changes everything
keep in mind this this is the believer
play rate here they really want me to go
shark and honestly it's hard to argue
against it when you're just rolling past
things over and over
roll me one more
time i don't think i need to tell you
that you're a piece but there you go
okay this one's for the believers
the thing again like with with like a
shark oh this is a
disgusting build this is the kind of
build when you're angry you just when
you get them you're just angry like look
at this
turkey
camel rhino like i i would be stunned if
we made it past the rhino
i feel like the rhino is going to go
buck wild on us
it is level two so yeah it's gonna you
you peace
it goes without saying you peace
it's just a nasty team
this is just i mean there's great shops
you know you get a turkey early define
your run by that you're in a great spot
we once we get this level two whale i'm
telling i'm
i'm freezing
i'm psycho i'm going psycho
okay
we kind of got it
okay this is big i know i know there's a
turkey there okay everybody chill
i'm i'm sorry to get rid of my scaling
on the penguin
but it will be this is
i i want you to know
this is done
because if we sell the fish
we lose this next round imo and this
next round is for the believers i'm
sacrificing
my future
potential to probably have a good chance
to win
10 rounds in order to do right by the
believers okay
that doesn't mean
we're gonna win right away
but we need to try to win this round
otherwise we're going down
now this is a spooky squad
there's no doubt about that
but the turtle's gonna eat it a little
it's gonna buff an ant which nobody
cares for oh that's huge man
please
please
that's fine
we win pay out the believers
[Laughter]
okay now
how the heck are we gonna get ourselves
out of this
probably looks something like this
sell me
the problem now is if we sell the
penguin
i mean sell a fish
it moves the dodo up one
no matter what unless you put a penguin
here which i don't respect too much
maybe but we need scaling
honestly if we're going to go further
the whale probably has to go at some
point
this
you're right this will get sold
we just got to think about what happens
next okay
hp is more important than attack so like
the reason i would want to buy the cat
is to go like cat
food but then the food goes on the dodo
and then it only gives attack attack's
good
but we need some defenses you know what
i think we can roll this
temporarily
and then do something like this
and then this
and we get the added benefit if this
doesn't work of maintaining the moral
high ground because i i
took chat's suggestion which puts me in
chat's position
it means that if this loses i get to be
like no we should just run what i was
gonna do it probably would have worked
it's a it's a privileged position to be
in and i i look forward to it
two melon armors huh
this this is one of those things that
looks worse than it is
again they they have a lot of attack oh
no they're gonna beat us okay
but we
look we didn't lose by as much as you
would think that we did
if if one unit lives a little longer
we wipe their squad which is how it
tends to go
i love the doubters typing
copium copium like you lost
sorry you feel bad but
we still gotcha
now this is not an ideal first shop for
us okay
a horse and two crickets they work
together
but you kind of need
two horses one cricket instead
but i think you you gotta give it a try
so we can at least have a tutu
i mean this is like having four tutus i
guess it's okay
you know that's happening you know
that's happening
misty glasses also known as uh
when you wear a surgical mask inside of
the grocery store
we want to see no three hp units
we want to see a buff beaver buff beaver
please buff beaver me
you peace
[Laughter]
i
think this takes us to a
draw you love to see it
graticus youtube
this is the squad right here um
and then we'll buff you
we'll roll once
we'll freeze you we don't need another
cricket just
you know what
you peace
yeah this isn't even a white weeny build
this is a teeny weeny build
uh we get hard countered i think by
three mosquitoes
especially when one of them shoots our
horse
that could not have gone worse
that's fine it happens
it's just i mean we got three mosquitoes
you can't even say like lucky shot you
just got to be like
you know good enough
this is a
combine me
combine me
sell me
by me
pre-buff camel kinda sick
three four fish
it's better
i mean crab i mean i guess it becomes a
4-6
yeah you know
you you've you've persuaded me
i think honestly you run what
essentially amounts to a 3-3 cricket and
then get ready to sell next turn
or to combine next turn
this is now we can roll a peacock i'm
gonna you're gonna hate this because
this is you should never freeze your
whole shop
but here i go freezing my whole shop
you gotta wonder what's what's going on
with some of the psychology and chat
sometimes i'm not trying to get salty
someone said i just keep believing i
don't know what's wrong with me you just
won two games in a row
what's what's what's the complaining
i i don't understand
you're on an unprecedented winning
streak right now
when we just won again
oh that's our first win technically but
um well not just technically like
literally
okay this is a smack me
smack me i know it's a temporary like
crab debuff
this is okay though this this is some
good stuff
no don't
this squad is still solid man as long as
we don't get hit by meat in phase one
i see no meat
this this squad looks fantastic for my
uh
for my camel and thus my peacock
this is good stuff okay send it send it
easy wins easy wins
nice sweater thank you yola tango
appreciate it
you need garlic
you need garlic too honestly so this is
a roll
this is the greatest day of my life
sell me
buy me
early monkey to scale that camel is
disgusting
uh i feel like
you gotta roll dodo man like even though
that the crab is better now the dodo
i know i know okay
it has not worked out for us recently
but that has not been the dodo's fault
like look at this guy he's running a
dodo at the front
you want to talk about belief
running a dodo at the front to get
scaled by a monkey is like he's betting
on his long-term success he's not even
trying to win right now he's fully
invested on the 10 spot
he must not have believers
he's a long-term investor
um i mean we could do that too
i'm not gonna though
i am gonna do this definitely we can
afford that
i think
honestly actually i think we just go
straight into double uh garlic
roll me once keep me there i'm happy
and l what's your favorite yola tango
record i mean come on it's gotta be uh i
can
hear the heart i can feel the heart
beating is one
sugar cube um
autumn sweater
that was a great get on that one
that that rat's gonna ruin my life man
the damage is done also called damage
i respect this build
that is uh like honestly just a bit of a
funky build that did great work
any time you get beaten by a rat you
pretty much just have to be like respect
so you can roll a hippo in position one
but one of the things that i've been
accused of quite aptly i might add
is uh pivoting too often and not letting
scaling effects have a time to actually
function that doesn't mean we wouldn't
roll a hippo but instead we might
benefit from just keeping the
compounding going on the uh
on the camel
i believe in that i don't believe in a
cricket
i do believe in this
surely
this is just a net positive for us even
if it's in a weird position right now i
understand there's going to be some
temptation to move it up to the front
long term i would like to move it up to
the front
short term
i would like to invest in some salad and
thankfully it hit our dodo
i would like to freeze two pairs to use
on our dodos
i would like to freeze two hippos to
scale you
this looks okay to me this looks like a
i'm them but stronger build
it sucks the peacock is gonna get us oh
no it's not not even close
i wasn't even looking at their attack
holy crap you're dusted man
you know they're in trouble when they
have a snail on the team like
sometimes you gotta buy one but
you know that's
that's not really what you're excited to
see
um
so here's here's where i'm at right now
i'm just being honest with you the dodo
is not long for this world it's reached
the point where
it's too late
it it it's not gonna get where i need it
to go in my opinion so i think that dodo
is is not long for this world
um
and the best option
for now
is to sell me
by me
maybe in the future we'll take a look at
you
these are huge misses but we need to use
these pairs their pears are probably
gonna get used
on
the camel in the hopes that they buff
the hippo
this is a it's a white weenie squad
our hip oh killing the horse is so huge
our hippo if they even get to the hippo
is gonna run wild this is this is good
stuff
i mean b early can be uh valuable and
occasionally you'll get you know caught
by like a tricky b or something like
that in the mid game but
otherwise i'm like man
you see a bee instead of some garlic
instead of some you know steak or
something like that you're a happy man
hippo didn't even have to go man oh okay
come on now
it's five wins
we're getting a little weird
i think you gotta you gotta do it man
he's playing against literal babies i
get sweaty try hearts is it possible
that
if we played online you would be the
literal baby and i would be the sweaty
tryhard just because i make it look so
damn easy
oops your peacock died
you got a dodo in the front as a rival
that person is going to get the 10 wins
man
their their freaking dodo is going to
get so buffed by the monkey
get ready
we just happened to face them at the
right time oh believers win again who
would have thought
imagine doubting dude
oh
man
um okay now
things are getting mighty interesting
now
the crocodile has been incredible for us
and could maintain its incredibility so
one thing i'm thinking is you could
possibly sell the peacock
and then roll tiger
behind monkey crocodile at the back
and then we're just investing all of our
dreams in in this squad right here
it's a little dangerous
but
i love how this will scale our camel if
possible um we'll get you buffed a
little we're probably gonna chuck a lot
you let's be honest
i think we also wish to
let's just invest in you for the time
being because the camel's gonna get a
nice investment by itself
tiger doesn't work on monkey
great intelligence thank you thank you
for now let's roll up behind the the
crocodile but maybe we'll do it behind
the hippo long term and i want to spend
i don't i don't want to reroll i want to
invest in some spending here let's let's
get that hippo up
false it does i just saw justin using it
the other day happy gilmore made this
same shot not more than one hour ago
this looks okay i'm a little concerned
about those chili peppers but
not that concerned
that ain't falco oh oh oh oh thank you
for the gifted by the way thank you much
appreciated okay there's seven wins
roll me
i mean juice me
we're looking for hippos please
melon armor would also be a top tier
again
that's
kind of a hippo
tiger you don't get an advantage really
out of having more except for the the
stat scaling but it's not bad
okay
one up
one up doesn't really need to work on
anybody i think i'm happy with what we
got here
yeah it works okay
totally works
there you go they pay out the payout the
believers on that one i think
this one could be spicy i i never count
out like a turkey
shark build
until i see it go by
um
you peace
we trade unfortunately yeah we we have
like literally nothing
uh once they get past the first two
units
we had a chance because they didn't have
a fly
tiger on shark would have killed that
round yeah it's true if only we had some
way to know exactly what composition our
opponent was running before the game
then i would simply place the tiger in
the position that had the maximum yield
you you don't want to do you don't want
to be a kathy wood evangelist okay you
find yourself december 31st you look at
the mutual fund that had the best
performance over the previous calendar
year why wouldn't i invest in the best
mutual fund you you pull out of the
mutual fund you're in that didn't do
well you rotate into that mutual fund
you find out that it turns out it's
mostly just standard deviation and
variance that causes a difference in
performance among mutual fund managers
all of a sudden you lose your next round
if you had left a tiger there to scale
the camel you would have gotten extra
wins out of it as a result
sometimes you just gotta you gotta stick
with a plan that you feel has the
evidence to get there even if you got
busted in the final round or the the
round that became previous
now
let me think here for a second
round 12. that's fairly early still
you need some scaling
let's scale you
hit the tiger which is not ideal but
that's okay
one up is not relevant hippo chili
pepper could get us out of a jam here
this looks okay what are you sniping
doesn't matter
doesn't matter
it's too late
excuse me do we get double hippo plays
now
well
never mind
anyway we win an interesting squad an
interesting squad to be sure
takes us to eight wins
turkey's not i mean yes turkey tiger is
great we don't have the we don't have
the infrastructure to
to scaffold it right now uh dude garlic
armor is good the time has come
for mel and armor to take its place
it's where it belongs it's what it
deserves
you can freeze me some pizza it's just
sweet and pizza hello kate hello
not not double pizza though cause we
might want some melon armor on our uh on
our hippo
this build needs more than two units now
that we we agree on that fully
uh this scares the crap out of me we're
going up against the squad that has four
gamers
that's fine
uh it has four gamers
at the end
[Laughter]
oh man
that's that's kind of incred you got to
give them respect man
they had we lost to a four
stack squad that had an ant at the back
that's crazy anyway it's an eight-way
and eddie you're absolutely right pay
out the believers no you you would think
based on the timbre in chat
that we just like got bodied over and
over we had a we had a six or seven and
an eight
no big deal we went 21 and 12 just like
rush did in 1986.
now
we're gonna hit a slash
marker sap ends
