Paragraphs:

	While working on homework 4 I learned that despite the size of my corpora and the technically different subject matter of each corpus, the source of all my corpora, NL, does
not structure his thoughts according to each video. By this I mean that while a video about the video game "The Binding of Isaac" and the video game "Super Auto Pets" are labelled
to be about completely different games, the majority of the transcript will be random anecdotes that NL is going over while the game goes on in the background. They definitely have
differences, especially when NL is actually talking about the games, but I would say it is somewhere like 80/20. This doesn't make any NLP task useless, it just makes it harder to
find sigificant differences. It might even make NLP tasks more important, if we ever get to designing a program that finds those minute differences between each video for me.

	I also think that this difference came into effect during the word embedding portion of the homework. Using word embeddings gave significantly worse accuracies, which I think is
most likely due to what I mentioned in the above paragraph. Besides all of that, the assignment enforced my current knowledge of neural nets from class and it was very interesting and cool
to see them work and play around with them on my corpora. A lot more things break in practice than in theory though...
