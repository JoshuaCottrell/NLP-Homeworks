is the rare they are the [ __ ]
am i the [ __ ] for telling my wife to
bring my youngest daughter with her
i have two daughters elise and addie
addie is also my wife's daughter
and elise is from a previous
relationship
remember when i said that people are bad
at explaining things
like why is this phrased as if it's like
a brain teaser
is this one like the doctor is a woman
is that how it goes
[Laughter]
is that the doctor was the kid's mother
i have two daughters one of them is also
my wife's daughter and elise is from a
previous relationship okay
i understand elise used to only visit
every other weekend but two years ago
her mom died and she moved in with us
since then my wife has taken elise out
once a week to get lunch and dinner
and shop and get their nails done go to
the beach as well as taking out elise
for ice cream or hot cocoa after her
therapy sessions
you're already in hot water on this one
my man
my wife takes addie out but not as much
as elise and when they go out it's
usually just to the park then for ice
cream or to the zoo
yeah she's four years old she's a little
kid
i'm gonna take a little kid to the
manicurist she's going to the zoo
that's like a top tier that's a top
outing man i've been to the zoo like six
times in my whole life
they're planning an overnight trip in a
beach town a few hours away for elise's
birthday and addie's upset she doesn't
get to go so i told my wife to bring
addie with her my wife said addie
wouldn't like most of the stuff they do
together and even if she did all of her
attention would be on addie making sure
she doesn't run off or get hurt
i told my wife addie's upset about not
getting to go with them she needs to
make it fair but she snapped and said
that addie gets the majority of her
attention every day and this is her
making it fair to elise
she left and is refusing to talk about
this again i just wanted to know if i'm
the [ __ ]
yes uh i you
i you gotta admit
when you write the post and are in
control
of the uh the tone and the content of it
and you still come across
like the [ __ ] i bet in real life
you're like
even more in the wrong
not to not to put too much pressure on
the guy
but i'm not saying he's like a war
criminal
but yeah okay so he's kind of the
[ __ ]
why is he the [ __ ] um couple of
reasons
one is you know these kids are 15 and
four
you have to treat a 15 year old
differently than you treat
a four-year-old and vice versa you know
a four-year-old requires substantially
more maintenance and and supervision and
a 15-year-old you're starting to get
them to the point
where they're gonna be entering adult
life you know you gotta
allow them to start experiencing stuff
that's more contemporaneous of their age
and you know i hate to say it
as well but like if you're going on a
trip with a 15 year old who by the way
lost her mother and goes to therapy all
the time
uh for it which makes perfect sense
you know a four-year-old is gonna cramp
your style i don't mean it in like oh
so my other kid is coming along gross
you know you know what a drag but i mean
you're gonna have a different experience
going out you know on a trip
with uh you know a 15 year old and a 40
year old and a 15 year old a 40 year old
and a four year old
anyway on top of that uh
your four year old needs to learn that
not everything is for everyone like if
the kid is not an
[ __ ] for being mad the kid is
four years old but like kids get mad at
stuff all the time
they like for no reason like
i i cried over you know as a kid i
uh cried over like the dumbest things
you could possibly imagine
when i was three i watched beetlejuice i
was traumatized for like years
the username is wifetrip which is is
kind of hilarious
yeah i still get upset over useless
stuff but uh
anyway long story short you are you're
the [ __ ]
i do also want to throw in like a
potential caveat here
which is that it kind of seems like
you want her to take both kids so that
you
can have some time to yourself
so you're like a little bit of a super
[ __ ]
if you're using the feelings and
emotions of your four-year-old
as like a cover because you actually
just want some time off which is a
natural reaction
for sure to want some time to yourself
but
you know you could also just take care
of the baby
or the toddler i guess yourself anyway
um you're the [ __ ] good lord your
wife is being a great stepmom
to your teenage daughter who just lost
her mom small kids get upset about not
being able to do the same things their
older siblings
do and that's normal you as a parent
have to deal with that disappointment
this is also
normal as part of being a parent make it
a daddy-daughter weekend do fun stuff
build stuff put a putter in her hands
whatever
is this person work at topgolf
or dick's sporting goods it's so
specific
the weekend andy stuff is now up to you
can you make it fun for her

what happened here
oh no no no
definitely he just wants an alone
weekend i know
people are like they whispered
look at his posts i don't i don't want
to look at his replies because then
you know it's like cyberbullying him but
uh
i could guess based on some of the
replies in there that
uh probably it wasn't reflected that
well
on him
[Laughter]
um i gotta know how this one goes man
am i the [ __ ] for walking out of the
house after the host told me to feel
free to leave because she doesn't like
people in her house
this just happened like an hour ago
backstory dating this guy and his best
friend was having a small party if you
can call it that whoa
hold on
[Laughter]
rude but also good one there were 10
people there at most i wasn't invited
but boyfriend
for lack of a better term what the hell
is going on
she's so sassy told me it would be okay
if i came usually i wouldn't go
somewhere without an invite but since
this is his best friend's house i
assumed he knew the situation better
than me
i show up go inside meet the best friend
and she didn't know i was coming
boyfriend says
hey this is who i told you about i
wanted you guys to meet the best friend
turns to me with a straight face and
says yeah it's all right i guess
but feel free to leave because i don't
really like people in my house
it's probably the weirdest thing you
could say to somebody
when you first meet them especially when
you're having a party
so i left i turned around and walked out
without saying another word now to be
completely fair my boyfriend was shocked
he came after me and said that he had no
idea that she would react that way but
she was just having a bad night and we
should go back in and everything would
be okay
obviously i left he didn't come with me
but now he's texting me and saying that
while she was a bit rude i was even more
rude
for just walking out in front of
everyone and that made for a weird vibe
with all the other friends who were
there
so am i the [ __ ] did i overreact hold
on
context there's a language barrier here
she speaks greek slash italian as first
languages and i english
so honestly her intent was questionable
but the look on her face gave me a weird
vibe
okay the the rest of this i'm not i'm
not worried about
um
i english
uh my my hunch here
i mean first off
i have occasionally said something
maybe not the strangers but like i've
said something
rude as like a joke or maybe i thought
it was a joke and the tone was bad
they took it literally and it it it has
happened before okay
so i'm putting myself in the mindset of
the the host
who maybe thought she was telling a joke
like i wouldn't it be weird if someone
who just met you told you to get the
[ __ ] out of their house
and then they're like whoa hold on you
didn't get i was joking
i was joking you know i'm saying it
could happen
but it it no matter what kind of an
[ __ ] joke from the host
language barrier accepted um
but the boyfriend come on man
the boyfriend didn't the this the the
headline here should not be am i the
[ __ ] for walking out of the house
really like it it's not if the host
wants to be an [ __ ] in their own
house then so be it
not you know my prerogative but the
boyfriend
staying at the party after they left
is like damning that's terrible
i would boyfriend in my opinion is the
[ __ ]
honestly i'm inclined to think that the
op in this situation
actually is kind of based
it's like not not the [ __ ] for one
but even beyond that like i'm giving you
a promotion i'm saying
why be you're based to have the
the stones to when somebody says feel
free to leave i don't like when people
are in my house to begin with
to just turn around and walk out
honestly that's
commendable
i give op the base award not the [ __ ]
your boyfriend and his friend are he
didn't come with you when you left
that's an [ __ ] move
ps does she have the hots for your
boyfriend see that's why i
i did i thought about the you can't
know that in advance that's the thing
you read into it for sure
but still
look you can't look at this in just from
one sentence be like they
you know they were definitely hooking up
you don't know they they might
they might just be a [ __ ]
can i kind of say that the the host is
based as well
i mean i think that they said something
that was rude for sure very impolite
but if you actually don't like people in
your house
and then like you invited 10 people and
someone brought a plus one
and you're like feel free to leave
because i don't like strangers then i'm
i'm kind of like you know what fair
enough
everybody's based here except your
boyfriend who is an [ __ ]
some of these headlines like
this one sorry okay
originally i was gonna say am i the
[ __ ]
am i the [ __ ] for not telling my
friend's daughter the truth about being
a paramedic
that's just uh i want to know how that
story goes
but i don't know if i can
not read this one am i the [ __ ]
for talking about my aunt's watermelon
ass
dan you ready for this one
my son and his friend put up a tire
swing in the yard for my grandchild
i posted a picture of me swinging in it
on facebook
my aunt dad's sister commented on it
saying
i hate skinny people this is one hell of
a start
i'm not one for facebook drama so
instead of commenting back i called her
i basically said i don't talk about her
watermelon ass
so she shouldn't be talking
now all my aunts five of them
are mad at me because apparently skinny
people can't be body shamed and i should
have told her first that i don't like
those comments instead of straight out
calling her on her watermelon
ass
he keeps typing him in i don't think i'm
the [ __ ]
because it's not like i told her i'm
skinny because my sisters and i have
always exercised more so we didn't
inherit the family watermelon ass
but skinny is also something i didn't
have to really work for it's just how i
am edit i
accept my everybody sucks here verdict
but i'm gonna take that to mean i suck
and so do all five of my aunts
if i'm going down they're going down
with me
i'm gonna be honest uh okay i've been
i've been doing this for too long i
slipped into the react mindset
i was gonna say not the [ __ ] but
they are kind of the [ __ ] but they're
also based
even though it was a private call you
didn't have to say
that your aunt had a watermelon ass to
her face
you could have just said hey i don't
like when you leave those sorts of
comments
on my facebook
i uh don't appreciate it it makes me
feel bad
that's one thing using the phrase
i basically said that i don't talk about
your watermelon ass so you shouldn't
talk about my weight
while hilarious
kind of makes you an [ __ ] being an
[ __ ] in response to having someone be
an [ __ ] to you
still it look it doesn't make you as
much of an [ __ ] as the
patient zero [ __ ] um but it probably
it gives
it does make you a little bit of an you
could have handled it better but i'm
glad you didn't because the story was so
entertaining
i basic can you imagine i if you were
listening to that phone call
like maybe you know they were doing the
call while you were on the couch or
something like that
yeah well i don't talk about your
watermelon ass so you shouldn't talk
about my weight
i can't even imagine oh man
the the ones that are not not the
[ __ ]
are so good by the way uh record lowest
margin fees by stockbrokers.com borrow
against securities
uh at low cost with interactive brokers
i'm only going for the [ __ ] ones now
am i the [ __ ] for yelling at my
stepfather when he suggested he could
walk me down the aisle
i gotta know man i gotta know
am i the [ __ ] for yelling at my
stepfather when he suggested he could
walk me down the aisle
so two weeks ago i got married to my
husband 25 female 26
male when i was six my mom and dad got
divorced and three years later my mom
met and married fred
the youtube guy
had basically been my surrogate dad for
all these years because my biological
one hasn't been a huge part of my life
and fred's kids are basically my
siblings
on last minute my bio dad decided he
didn't want to come to my wedding and
walk me down the aisle i got the call
while i was getting my makeup done and i
was devastated
needless to say fred was in the room and
he started comforting me telling me it
would be okay and he said if you want i
could walk you down
okay look you can see how this goes
she's upset she just had a
a staggering emotional blow
fred i here's what i'm inclined to say
if this goes where you expect it to go
okay
fred steps in knowing that this
is a stomach on top of a hand grenade
he he knows that there's a decent chance
that he's going to take some collateral
damage as a result of this
so i'm inclined to think that that fred
knew he was going to take a bullet here
and has no
even though maybe she was an [ __ ] to
him
i bet fred was like no she's not the
[ __ ]
you know terry's the [ __ ]
sometimes you gotta you know the right
thing to do is to offer and then when
you get clipped
you're like you know i knew that could
happen
that rubbed me the wrong way i was
already a mess emotionally fred knew how
much i wanted my bio dad to walk me down
the aisle
and he just suggested it like it didn't
matter at all okay
she's kind of the [ __ ]
for even now two weeks later still
thinking fred is a [ __ ]
you can be angry in the moment but two
weeks later being like
he still did something wrong you got
with
the benefit of hindsight should make
this a little bit more apparent
i hadn't just gotten my heart broken i
just snapped and told him he was selfish
and
told him to get out fred left and one of
my uncles ended up walking me down the
aisle
i didn't expect it to to turn that fast
in a single
uh in a single paragraph
my mom only heard about mine and fred's
fight after the wedding and she is now
pissed off at me telling me i
overreacted and i need to apologize to
fred
even though i was just frustrated and he
had suggested something totally out of
left field
she needs a copywriter what do you mean
suggested something completely out of
left field it's like the most
inevitable suggestion of all like you're
you're the step that can you imagine
being the stepdad
and then like you're in the room with
her
her bio dad deadbeat calls
and goes uh i can't make it or whatever
the footies on uh plus my fiance is at
the hospital three hours away
selfish lady um and then she's crying
and then in her head she's like
you know i if anybody asks me to help
then i'm gonna
freaking snap he's there like oh
awkward well i um it's obvious he's
gonna suggest that he's gonna walk you
down the aisle he's like your dad
at this point
anyway fred what a [ __ ] dude
yeah he's gonna be like that sucks peace
out unless you go check on your mother
um my mom told me i was the selfish one
apparently and apparently i'm ungrateful
selfish i don't know that's tough
ungrateful yes
extremely but i feel like his suggestion
was
completely wrong and then i don't need
to apologize but i don't want to make
things worse by not apologizing
if i did do something wrong hey um
if this is real and you believe in the
sentence that you're saying here
which is i don't want to make things
worse by not apologizing if i did do
something wrong
i'm only a few years older than you but
i want to give you some advice
just apologize you
you can apologize sincerely
not being like sorry i guess you can
apologize
even if your heart's not a hundred
percent in it
you can you can recognize someone else's
feelings were hurt by your actions
and be the bigger person and be like hey
i
am explaining explaining the context for
why i was upset to begin with explaining
why to some extent i still feel like i
was in the right but also at the same
time i apologize to you because i know
that i hurt your feelings
and your relationship as my stepdad who
raised me for the last 16 years
it means more than like this one little
flashpoint emotional incident that we
had
um i if i was fred
i'd be like first off because i'm
checking am i the [ __ ] every day
i would be like great job um i'm glad
reddit told you to apologize
guess what you can't borrow the beamer
tonight
you got to take the ford escort
and your honeymoon it's not honolulu
anymore
hold on there's a great job it's not
honolulu anymore
but don't worry i made reservations at
benahana
uh anyway um but fred he seems like he's
better than that
okay he seems like he's better than that
um
let's see what happened
you're the [ __ ] you just said your
bio dad oh god it's a numbered list
you just said your bio dad wasn't
involved in your life your stepdad was
your dad growing up your stepdad didn't
impose himself at all until your bio dad
flat out rejected your request
your stepdad was trying to be supportive
and you rejected him if he hadn't
offered would you have been happier stop
projecting your anger at your bio dad on
your step dad 43 000 upvotes
[Laughter]
rough biking aims based she just got
blew
up
[Laughter]
oh no
i do it the the [ __ ] comments are too
easy man
it's like you just open it up and you
feel good the not the [ __ ] are like
they're so much more reasonable
hold on watermelon ass
i gotta i gotta know this one am i the
[ __ ]
for not telling my friend's daughter the
truth about being a paramedic
please don't repost anywhere okay you
know then
let's not
okay am i the [ __ ] for driving away
from a hiking trip with my boss's
husband
i recently female 26 moved to a new city
after getting a job
i've been having a hard time making
friends most of the people i know so far
are from work
we all get along but we aren't close
more like acquaintances
very reasonable so far my boss sue has
been very welcoming since i moved she
often has us all over for dinner she
loves to celebrate whenever there's a
baby
birthday big milestone on the team
last week i was out to lunch with sue
and a few other co-workers when sue told
me about a hiking group her husband runs
and how it's a great way
to meet people she said she'd be he'd be
leading a hike on monday
and the whole team should go since it's
a holiday monday was my birthday but i
hadn't told anyone i didn't have any
other plans so i said yes to the hike
these are normal people so far i can't
wait to see what kind of monkey wrench
[ __ ] the whole thing off i drove to the
meeting spot on monday which is kind of
remote and up in the hills
nobody was there when i arrived beside
sue's husband greg
okay i asked him where everyone was he
said no one else could make it and it
would just be us on the hike
it was early morning and still dark and
i didn't know greg other than seeing him
in passing at sue's house
i knew he was probably a nice guy but i
felt nervous going hiking in a dark
remote area with a man who's practically
a stranger
completely reasonable
in fact greg probably should have sent
something to the group chat
that was like hey we're calling it off
this monday
because i wouldn't feel comfortable
going on a walk with a stranger as well
in the dark
he could get murdered too but i guess
he's not that worried about that
i called sue and she told me that
something came up with her kid but i
should go it'll be worth it for the view
etc
i still felt unsettled and asked greg if
we could postpone for a day when others
can come
he got frustrated yo spinning machine
thank you
thank you for the gifted subs he got
frustrated saying it's no big deal we
should hurry up and start
red flag i was more nervous at that
point and thanked him before saying i
was gonna head home
that upset him even more and he came
toward me and asked if i thought he was
a serial killer
he seemed angry so i panicked and jumped
in the car saying i had to go
he kept yelling at me to stop as i drove
away
would a serial killer do this
i was on the way home terrified when sue
called me apparently the hiking trip was
a cover for a surprise birthday party
the team was throwing me at the lookout
point oh come on
she found out my birthday through
facebook and greg was supposed to lead
me there i felt terrible and offered to
drive back but sue was pissed
and said i ruined it for everyone and
made greg feel like a creeper
now the environment at work is tense sue
and my coworkers
only talk to me when they need something
and they didn't invite me to team
lunch i feel like i really messed up
possible fake story okay if this is not
a fake story
in my opinion the biggest [ __ ] are
actually the co-workers
like your boss and her husband being
deluded because they were too close to
the source
it happens your your team members who
can get a bird's-eye view of the
situation and could completely
understand why you thought you were
gonna get murdered by your boss's
husband
being like we're gonna ice you that's a
[ __ ] move
um the boss should have led you there
for sure
i mean if this is no you're not the
[ __ ]
and and this might even be controversial
nobody involved is the [ __ ] for
setting up the surprise
party a little bit of like the dumbest
way possible to do it like hey we're
colleagues or acquaintances um at best
we're gonna throw a super sketchy
situation or lead you to a surprise
party
not the way you should do it but pretty
dumb not [ __ ] necessarily
uh everybody icing you afterwards huge
[ __ ] if this story is real
uh you're obviously not the [ __ ] uh
of course get in the van it's for a
surprise party
i love the idea it does make more sense
now
like if i was leading a hiking trip and
only one person showed up and they were
like i'm gonna leave so
i don't think you're gonna murder me but
just in case i'm gonna leave i would be
like
yeah that's perfectly reasonable that
makes complete sense
um but
i well i certainly would not just go hey
what do you think i'm a serial killer
but if there was a surprise party like a
kilometer away
and they were relying on me to get the
birthday person to the surprise party
i might get a little i'd be like no come
back i'm
i'm normal you know like i that might
get me to be angry
not angry you know what you're right i
probably would have just been like hey
but that would have been so much
creepier if you're like hey
there's a there's a surprise party for
you all your friends are there at the
top of the cliff
that would have been like way scarier i
think i'd be like i'll just
[Laughter]
i don't know it's just a bad situation
all around
i always say
yeah just don't do that to begin with
okay let's find some
[ __ ] man
let's find some [ __ ] i did like this
one i i had to know where this one was
coming man
am i the [ __ ] for not giving up my
bed to a pregnant woman
my grandma is on her last days
probably not the [ __ ] in this
situation
and wish to see all her grandkids for
the last time
so my family came up with a plan to
visit her we're all adults in our 20s
didn't want to deal with the airport
chaos so we decided to drive
los angeles to durango we rented an
eight-seat van since it was six of us my
two brothers and their wives and my
cousin
the day of the trip we find out one of
my sister-in-law's anna invited her
sister ruby
i need to bust out the white board
invited her sister ruby to come along
said she wanted to get out of the house
and because we had extra space
this is not a real story
nobody in history especially someone
that's pregnant
is going to be like i've got nothing
else to do let's go on like a
20-hour road trip that's just it's
unbelievable
it undermines the rest of the story
everyone was okay with it but i was a
little annoyed since i wanted my cousin
with cerebral
palsy to ride more comfortably but it
seemed like he was fine with it so i
didn't worry yeah okay
look if the story is is real there's
certainly a lot of factors in here baked
in from the get-go
that make it seem like op is uh
absolved of all possible judgment
i drove the first seven hours of the
trip we'd already booked two rooms with
two queen beds each in advance one room
was dedicated for my two brothers and
their wives and the other for my cousin
and i
when we were heading to check on our
rooms ruby by the way we don't want to
deal with the airport chaos
having 10 adults get their passports
scanned get a ticket sit in the chair
arrive at your destination
picking what restaurant to eat at in the
terminal
so messy who needs to deal with it you
know what we'll do instead
i will just drive up we'll book several
hotel rooms and
here's the room that you're in everybody
and
you know like this way easier this way
we'll rent a car
we'll strap in my cousin who has
cerebral palsy this should what could
possibly go wrong
right we get into the room
i'm not even reading the rest of the
hotel stuff because i
come on just just take uh if you said
we're not going to fly because it's
expensive okay if you said we're not
gonna fly
because of the mess this is like i mean
this is
it's like a 45 minute flight man anyway
not to mention why why ruby
wants to be involved with this to begin
with oh you guys are gonna go see
you're gonna go watch your grandma die
well if you got space in the car i got
nothing going on that sounds like it
could be uh
could be exciting it's just none of the
story checks out at all
if it's real i'm being very insensitive
and i apologize
but um okay ruby
immediately asks where i'm sleeping i
stayed quiet but then laughed because i
thought she was
joking i explained to her that we were
sharing the bed since my cousin with
cerebral palsy needs his own bed
she said anna told her she would be
getting this bed and she needs to have
her own bed because she's pregnant i
told her no we're sharing this bed
she quickly became upset and called her
sister to come talk to me anna of course
sided with her sister
i was furious at this point i drove
seven hours i just want to sleep
can i can i say something another
unbelievable part of this what what kind
of what kind of freak
says let's go on a road trip
i love road trips seven hours of driving
they're like
i'm so freaking zonked
i need to pass out that's not
i don't like road trips i've driven
seven hours in a sitting
i'm not like i gotta go to bed i'm like
let's get a let's get dinner or
something it's a long
drive but you chose to do the road trip
because it sounds like fun
all right i lost chat on that one but
regardless if you love road trips so
much you can't complain about seven
hours that's just my two cents i drove
seven hours i just wanted to sleep i
told her she could sleep with me
in the bed i paid for eventually
everyone from the other room comes over
there's an
entire argument among us with everyone
taking sides
i was told i was being selfish because
ruby is pregnant i'm sorry but i offered
her to sleep with me
not to kick me out of my own bed there's
so many bed-based
stories on am i the [ __ ] huh
i didn't realize how many stories about
bed sharing
or uh present here
okay i will fight everyone before i
sleep on a floor
or a hotel room i paid for when i get
out there's gonna be carnage
eventually i laid down on one side of
the bed and did not move
they tried to wake me up so i could move
but i wouldn't budge i just laid there
until they left the room eventually ruby
laid down on the other side of the bed
and we all woke to the next day
there's tension among us even though
we're back in ca now
anna her husband one of my brothers anna
her husband one of my brothers and ruby
think i'm a selfish person for not
giving up my bed to a pregnant woman
on the other hand my other brother and
his wife as well as my cousin side with
me even though i do feel bad i still
offered ruby a space am i the [ __ ]
um
you are a fiction writer and this would
be a great
sketch comedy sketch
that's my thought on this i also want to
interview
anna the pregnant woman who thought
because she's got nothing to do
like when you're it depends how pregnant
you are to begin with i suppose
but if you're let's assume you know
she's like
four or five months on you're getting
you know morning sickness you got a
bowling ball
in your abdomen your your moods going up
and down you've got
gastrointestinal issues you got to take
like
you you get random cravings for stuff
you want to nap at 2 pm you want to wake
up at 4 00 am
you got to take prenatal vitamins and
folic acid
every single day you got again who is
like
let's go on a road trip like the most
inconvenient way to travel
especially on on top of being pregnant
to begin with
and then it's like you don't even get to
like coachella at the end you just get
to
you know watch someone else's grandma in
hospice
it's just a weird it's just a weird
story
if true everybody sucks here but mostly
i just want to interview the lady
anyway
am i the [ __ ] for telling my sister
what she said is a hipaa violation
probably not
okay i'm i'm looking i'm looking for red
flare am i the [ __ ] for not paying
half of my boyfriend's rent and bills
there could be there could be some
some meat on that one there could be
some
meat on that one
gonna try and be brief here due to the
character limit well that's a first
my boyfriend 26 male and i 24 female
have been dating for just over two years
we never lived together
well i would say you're not the [ __ ]
then so far
that's if you don't live together then
no you shouldn't be paying half his rent
my boyfriend took a job in a different
city two hours away without asking me
for my opinion or telling me
that he'd applied for it it was his
dream job and so not taking it was never
an option he said he never asked me to
move with him
but even if he had asked i wouldn't have
been able to i live in the same town as
my parents who are both ill and i
wouldn't want to move away while they
still need me my job is also here the
city he's moving to is also nearly twice
as expensive to rent in
this obviously caused some friction
between us and we nearly broke up but i
ultimately agreed to visit him regularly
that's a lot of context to start with
also secondarily i don't understand what
your boyfriend could possibly be mad
about
right now when you move to a city
without asking somebody and they're like
no
what are you gonna you can't be mad
since he moved i've gone to visit him
once or twice a month for a week at a
time when covet allows it and it's not
cheap
the train to see him is about 50 bucks
each way
we don't live in the u.s but that's the
current conversion rate
so i'm spending one to two hundred
dollars each month to see him
and i pay half of any grocery shopping
we do okay this i feel like i'm
unschooled again
i i do love you can tell at first i was
like maybe they're canadian
then i realized they must be european
because they think a 50
train fee is like egregious whereas in
north america if you take the train one
stop it's like 300
i'm not i'm this is not like money
lording like oh you think that's
expensive it's just genuinely
it in north america the rail
infrastructure means that
taking a train is unbelievably expensive
well maybe not in the northeast
okay but on the west coast for sure
but i think uh this is a situation where
maybe in europe you could uh
take the train from amsterdam to
belgrade for like 75 bucks
trained to my nearest city is seven
dollars that's crazy man
anyway sorry i get mired in the
logistics a little bit
um i pay half of the grocery shopping we
do i also rent my own apartment back in
my hometown
when i visit him i stay at his apartment
where he lives alone
and pays 975 dollars per month in rent
okay i understand last week he told me
he wants me to start paying half his
bills and half the rent for when i come
to stay with him
your boyfriend is uh
stupid i don't even need to read the
rest of the story
it like he he's got an okay thing going
here
you really want to spend half of your
time together doing like an excel
spreadsheet of like well you were here
from the 11th to the 19th
uh the month this is february it only
has 28 days so i'm gonna need you to pay
half of a third of the rent and then
also
this is how much data we used over this
like just become an accountant if this
is the kind of stuff that gets you hard
this is i i understand if you need the
the means but this might be like a
breakup situation
in this case like this it does seem like
a a cash app
question for ninth grade unschooled
okay i told him i wasn't okay with that
for a few reasons he's the one who chose
to move to an expensive city without any
of my input
yes can i can i add as well as
maybe this is too technical but his rent
is inelastic whether she's there or not
it's going to cost 975 dollars a month
i'm assuming like i don't know how much
electricity costs there but i can't
imagine that
you know having one more person in the
house would raise the water and
electrical bill by more than like 10 or
15 percent like
it just seems like a little it just
seems needless
you know i told him i wasn't okay i
already paid 100 and 200 to 200
on train fares to see him now what she
is not
noting is that sure she's paying for the
train ticket but
she also gets to go on a train ride
which is a lot of fun
so if anything i don't know why she's
trying to act like that's a cost that
she doesn't want to bear
is like being on a pedestrian roller
coaster so that's
that's the first time i think that maybe
she's the [ __ ]
i have to pay for my own apartment if i
paid half his rent my cost of living
would be higher than his for a situation
i didn't choose
he replied that it wasn't fair that his
bills increased when i came to visit him
because of the water and electricity
he's actually not her boyfriend he's
her landlord i told him my train fare
was the equivalent of that
and also much more expensive than just
my portion of the water
so if he wanted me to pay half the bills
then he would have to pay half my train
fare
this wouldn't be fair as he's not the
one taking the train
so he shouldn't have to pay
my own twisted brain actually
came to the conclusion of where this guy
was going
oh i'm supposed to pay half of your
train fare and i don't get to even
get the thrill of going on the train
oh my god at this point i just told him
pay
half my train fare or we both move
somewhere that isn't expensive or i
stopped visiting
he told me i was unwilling to compromise
which apparently is just
doing whatever he says and not
suggesting anything else
and the atmosphere has been frosty ever
since i don't think i'm being
unreasonable but i've spoken to a few
friends and the opinion seems split
so i'm putting it to the reddit hive
mind
[Laughter]
seems pretty split not the [ __ ] and i
think you're on to something with the
option to stop visiting
haha yeah that's pretty much where i'm
at right now
all right sounds like you know
my ex-husband bought a house without
discussing it with me and quit his job
without discussing it with me
who are these people man this is crazy
your husband bought a house without
asking about it
not the [ __ ] this guy is not a keeper
i love dude it's jim from the office
it's such a great line i asked him to
pay half my train fare he said why i'm
not taking the train
oh man that's so good
all right we we got one more i think am
i the [ __ ] for saying i'll see you
there to my ex's aunt telling me i'm
going to hell
forget that i don't know if that that's
that's a story you come up with in your
head
in the shower after you had an argument
i just want to see
just want to see one more [ __ ]
situation
[ __ ] am i the [ __ ] mother-in-law
refuses to check
baby sugar levels
am i the [ __ ] for not letting my son
move out come on come
on am i the [ __ ] for telling my
brother not to bring his wife to family
events
league of legends oh no no
no this is the longest post i've ever
seen in my life
i come from a very orthodox family
there's certain rules for women in my
family like not wearing revealing
clothing such as jeans
makeup or roaming around alone at night
that's the problem
with western women they're always doing
crazy stuff like putting on
denim pants and roaming around at night
you you talk to any american woman you
ask her what she likes to do she's like
i like to put on my levi's
just go roaming not really with like any
kind of purpose or goal in mind just
kind of you know feeling it out out
there
i'm aware that most of it's unfair but
they won't change and i can't move out
without losing all contact with my
family
a few years back i started attending
this language class my parents agreed
very reluctantly
as long as you don't wear jeans no jeans
i don't want you
showing off your body in those
incredibly stiff denim pants
and became friends with a girl there
introduced her to my older brother who
would pick me up from class
long story short they fell in love and
eloped probably the most
work that long story short has ever done
my mother was devastated she cried for
days and blamed me for introducing that
witch to my brother
my brother moved into an apartment
pretty close of ours but maintained his
distance and gradually died down
i'm assuming that the brother didn't die
down there's the
the controversy until this year when
they finally decided to reconcile
i thought they would tone things down
and slowly get my parents to approve of
their marriage it was naive of me to
think that
my sister-in-law only wears short pants
and skirts for every family event
this she's wild man she's like madonna
she talks about moving to europe never
having kids and everything else that
would give my mother a stroke
she has the luxury of saying all this
and running back to the safety of her
house
she's got the luxury
of living her life how she wants to
and then running away to a place that
she probably partly pays for
well i sit here with no choice but to
deal with my mom's insanity
i'm the one who has to sit through the
aftermath the minute she leaves my
parents start yelling about how much
shame and bad luck she's gonna bring our
family
they also never forget to point out that
none of this would have happened if i
hadn't gone to that language class
that seems fair i repeatedly asked my
sister-in-law
to just wear normal clothes can you stop
with the freak stuff the short pants
come on like you're enjoying this are
you you sicko
showing up wearing your short pants and
skirts
you just wear some normal clothes for a
few hours but she doesn't listen
i guess this is her way of rebelling or
getting revenge
recently my older sister gave birth to a
child and there's plenty of ceremonies
that are to be performed
these ceremonies are huge most of my
relatives will be attending
i can only imagine the fights that will
start at home
my brother called to ask me if there's
something he could do [ __ ]
[ __ ]
[ __ ] i straight up told him not to
show up or
show up without your wife he called me
an [ __ ] and said i was just like our
parents
[Laughter]
oh i know that the only people in the
wrong here are my parents
you're half right you're half right on
that
but i know them and i know they won't
change and i
don't think wearing different sets of
clothes for a few hours is a big deal
and if it is they can just not attend
so i think i'm not the [ __ ] but maybe
i just can't see it so tell me reddit
english is not my first language so
ignore my mistakes your english is
fantastic your language class if that's
was
if that was what it was for really pay
dividends you're very erudite and
articulate
unfortunately the content of your post
is bad [ __ ]
insane um i'm
also terrified because
the edit is probably three times longer
than the original post so let's see what
kind of context we can get here
edit i live in a south asian country
definitely do not have the resources or
the support to leave my family
at least not right now okay i have no
issues with what my sister-in-law wears
if i was i never would have even
befriended her
which i did before she married my
brother thank you very much
i'm i'm a free thinker just because
she's wearing jeans
i mean i don't judge someone just for
the choice of pants they choose to wear
when i said she talks about being child
free and moving to europe i did not mean
she
should not do so what i was trying to
say is she's aware that this will
upset my parents and will still bringing
up bring it up in front of them
i'm guessing most of the comments are
from people in the west it might be easy
to walk away from your family where you
live family is everything you have here
however i asked for judgment from an
impartial source so i will accept
whatever verdict i get
can i tell you that's all fair
that i can't disagree with that
i will also say and okay they did also
say they're going to be turning 17 this
year
i walk back i walk back a little bit of
the foul language i use that i
i assumed they were in their 20s so
by the way your english is so good
that's crazy
at first i was like your english is
great
and now i'm like your english is amazing
we're walking it back we're walking it
back
and i also understand
when you're in it well i understand at
least the idea you know i've lived in
essentially the same culture my entire
life when you're
in a culture that has a different
opinion than somewhere else i'm sure
that you know
some of the statements that seem
ridiculous to somebody who's grown up in
north america
it seems perfectly normal and someone
that grew up in the culture wouldn't
actually
see anything wrong with what they're
saying
in my defense
thinking that jeans are revealing is
really funny it's actually like one of
the funniest things in my opinion has
ever been written
anywhere online have you ever seen
jinko's
maybe jinko's would be okay
i i just love the idea that she's
she's showing up in in jeans showing off
just showing off and revealing jingles
whispering all the time
anyway sorry so let's
continue i thought i mentioned my age in
my post but i didn't i'll be turning 17
this year so no i just can't leave
very fair leaving would mean running
away and they'll just call the cops to
bring me back
that part probably didn't need to be
said but i get your point so there's no
point
my brother doesn't see anything wrong
with how my parents treat me his
progressive only starts and ends with
his wife he will definitely not let me
move in with him your brother
is not the [ __ ] here why are you
being so rude to your brother
he's ju your brother is just out here
living his own life
and all he you're like he's a [ __ ]
because he won't let me stay with him i
don't know
like you're 17.
the whole situation is fair if he's a
teenager it's definitely more fair
but he is kind of an [ __ ] for asking
his brother not to bring his wife to the
to the the wedding or the the ceremony
some of you send really nice messages
but there's also a lot of mean ones so
i'm sorry but i'm not just going to open
any of them
fair enough since most people have voted
for [ __ ] i'm going to accept that
for an update nothing has changed in the
positive direction
my brother was really annoyed with the
way that i spoke to him yesterday since
i'm younger than him
he might also be
annoyed because you said
don't bring your wife to the ceremony
has nobody brought this up to op
yet i feel like it would save a lot of
problems
maybe it's cultural that you don't talk
back to somebody that's older than you
and your family but also
i think cross-culturally you don't tell
your family like hey you can come to the
party but don't bring your wife because
she's skanking it up in her levi's
there's a silver lining though i called
my older sister and told her what
happened
and she's asked me to come stay with her
for a week under the guise of helping
her prepare for the ceremony so
hopefully
they'll forget about this by the time we
meet next i did reach out to my
sister-in-law
but she hasn't responded which i guess
is fair
i did send her an apology i also want to
apologize to all the people from the
west for implying family isn't as
important to you
i was very angry when i wrote that i had
a whole night to think about it i was
definitely wrong of me so i'm very sorry
i that's look that's pretty impressive
for a teenager probably getting piled on
here not the least of which by me as
well
like that that being said
i can only speak from my own position
but i was like i think you're kind of in
the right
it sounds like your family is is
probably more important than i would
consider the average north american's
family to be
i feel like a lot of the other like did
i mean did you see what the lady said to
her stepdad
when her stepdad was like maybe i can
walk you down the aisle and she told him
to go get bent
i don't think that would happen if the
shoe was on the other foot here so i
i don't think he was totally out of the
out of line
anyway verdict verdict on this one long
story short
look it's like real court okay
if you're 16 you can still murder
somebody like you could be charged with
murder
but my hands are tied i can't condemn
you to being an [ __ ]
because you're you're not of the legal
age to put an [ __ ] prison
so as far as i'm concerned you're did
you
did you commit the crime of being an
[ __ ] yes in my opinion
the the context adds a lot to this as
i'm sure it would add a lot to every
situation
however you did tell your brother hey
come to the ceremony but don't bring
your wife because she's
you know showing off her ankles and
those capri pants
so i think you're on probation
when you turn 18 your record gets uh
expunged also your parents
like from an outside observer standpoint
kind of suck
definitely kind of sucks so maybe more
than kind of
anyway that was fun
that was a that was a fun segment let me
take it off the main screen for a second
uh i'm gonna run to the bathroom



just to set the stage i'm hoping that
that the title screen just has an
endless loop
i'm hoping it doesn't just uh stop after
the song is done and then lead to me
restarting it but whether it is or it
isn't that's okay
i'm excited um it's been i
i mean the it's been a week i'm looking
i i i don't browse our slash am i the
 throughout the week
because i don't want to uh spoil myself
for what's gonna happen
but seeing that the first person who
made a post here deleted their account
my god something something must have
gone wrong
i can't imagine what it actually is but
uh maybe it attracted a little bit too
much attention or something like that
but i'm excited either way
um oh yeah that's top today that's not
top this week you're absolutely right
user was awarded silver for this post
so true my my fellow gentle sir okay
let's let's load up top by this week
uh it's oh my god i
i'm preserving it for you a little bit
here
get ready for this okay this is a good
one
um
right here
am i the for calling my sister's
husband useless
i'm gonna go ahead and say the answer to
that i mean it's one of those they
always bait you right
it says not the but the title is
like you sound like kind of a butthole
but let's see here okay let's scroll up
and see and also sol raya thank you for
the gifted subscriptions
my seven i'm 17. my sister 34 called me
saying that her work had an emergency
and she needs to get there asap
she needed me to watch her kids because
no one else can i rushed over there just
to find her husband locked in his game
room playing video games
i asked her why she called me over if he
was home and she said he didn't want to
babysit because it was his only day off
already kind of a bad start um
why people are saying this is me this is
not me at all i
i cut my my gaming hours by like
two-thirds
to be the greatest dad you could ever
expect in your entire life
just because i'm a gamer who's also a
dad doesn't mean i'm ignoring my
fatherly responsibilities i mean do you
not see that i
i got the polo shirt buttoned up to the
top you can't get much more deadly than
that
sister left i started hanging with the
kids i was changing the baby's diaper
and the other kids wanted a snack i told
them to go ask their dad to make them a
snack since the baby had a blowout
and it was gonna take a while to clean
him up well their dad sent them back
upstairs and told them to ask me again
after cleaning the baby up i made the
kids a snack and their dad came out to
eat and told me not to let the kids
interrupt him on his day off okay
very bad um already
obviously not the the the dad
is uh kind of a piece of garbage for
sure at least based on this story
whether it's true or not
i kind of snapped at him and told him it
was my day off too and that he's a
useless effing father
and husband if his wife has to rely on
her teenage sister rather than her own
husband
he started telling me i was
disrespectful and didn't understand how
hard parenting is i told him he clearly
doesn't understand how hard it is either
since he considers parenting his own
children to be babysitting
he ended up kicking me out and
apparently my sister was forced to come
home because he told her she needed to
figure it out since i'm her sister
this is i i don't even have anything to
react to right now because this is like
such a cut and dry situation
um but hey how many levels of iq are you
on
you just kicked out your free babysitter
um because she asked you to like cut up
a mango for
your own kids or something i feel like i
may be the because my sister's
mad at me her husband is mad at me my
mom is mad at me for causing drama my
dad thinks it's funny and agrees with me
based father
based father incoming i definitely
didn't need to call him names but i just
hate this guy so much
we've argued about things in the past my
sister's saying i need to apologize and
he's threatening to never let me into
the kids lives if i keep disrespecting
him
oh man this is pretty bad
uh edit wow i was not expecting this uh
and to the people who message me dick
pics or to kill myself what why
lol y'all are crazy yeah i mean this is
i have
a lot of sympathy for you also welcome
to the internet anytime you make
something that's popular you
uh become a conduit and a lightning rod
for the most insane people that have
ever existed on planet earth
uh unfortunately that's uh i think
that's read it in a nutshell
um for anyone who asked no he does not
take care of the kids normally
my sister takes them to daycare and then
picks them up on her way home
she's the breadwinner and the primary
caretaker
can i tell you um i mean this is a uh
it's a long a story from a long time ago
one time my friend was driving me to
mouse university campus
which is like five hours away and we
picked
up a friend of my drivers
uh and when when we picked him up he was
like dude i gotta get out of my house
my stepdad is in there and uh like
all he does all day is play the game
black on
ps2 so then we we
you know when we picked him up we were
like yeah he's playing black on ps2
the middling first person shooter i
swear to god we drove away
spent the whole weekend at mal's
university house came back and then he
was still playing black on the ps2
like the guy is he was in love with the
game
also is probably like you know at that
point the game was maybe like four years
old
we were deep into the ps3 era
it's the ultimate dad game anyway um
sorry that was i i'd like everybody else
on the internet i took this story as an
opportunity to insert my own
uh much less interesting story that
feels more interesting because it
happened to me instead of to a stranger
this is the easiest question of all time
uh you are not the
for calling your sister's husband
useless that's a gimme
uh and then on top of that uh this guy
does not seem like
a if he exists does not seem like a good
father i mean i'm
i'm his age are there days where i
uh you know and i wake up in the morning
and i'm like oh i don't feel like as
excited about changing diapers today i
don't feel as excited about
you know doing feeding time or bath time
or whatever of course you know
it's a lit there's some drudgery and
sometimes you're like oh i'm desperate
for like a little time for myself
but you know both parents everybody
involved in raising the kid goes through
the exact same
uh situation you're you're all feeling
like you need some time so you gotta
lean on each other you just do it anyway
that's what it means to be a uh
that's what it means to be a good parent
on top of that um i know people are like
it's crazy that people were sending them
um illicit photos because they're
underage
yeah you shouldn't be doing it to begin
with i feel like a lot of people are
maybe focusing on the worst aspect of it
for sure but
i am surprised at how many people in
chat are like holed up they send
nude photos to a 17 year old
you shouldn't do it to begin with that's
kind of like the open and shut case on
that one it's not like well
i did uh send a naked photo of myself to
a stranger because they made a post on
reddit i didn't like but at least they
were
18 in two days you know anyway those
this that's mega bad everything about
this post is mad
or is bad i should say
let's move on to something that maybe
has a little bit more uh
react-ability associated with it let's
see
am i the for ruining my sister's
wedding
yo the music is so legit don't downvote
 by the way
um throwaway account and please don't
repost anywhere else
every time do we have to do this every
single time
i i'm laughing like people always make a
post on like am i the
and then they're like please don't
show this to anybody i just want
everybody on the internet to see it but
do not share it at with anybody else at
all
how about this one am i the for
being surly
rude and mean at a wedding and leaving
early
disclaimer i'm trying to get a tv show
made out of this so please do not
copy i am i the for being surly
rude and mean at a wedding and leaving
early
i was asked to be a member of the
wedding party despite this i was
time to caps lock was uh one sentence
get ready
despite this i was the only person
at the ceremony who was not allowed to
have a plus one
this was an outdoor wedding with
unlimited seating and these people don't
give a
s about covid so it wasn't about that
okay
i feel like this are there edits
involved here i have to wonder
why you were the only person not allowed
to have a plus one
because let um just hear me out here
if you specifically were not allowed to
have a plus one
my question and i don't want to say
hunch
my question is you might have terrible
taste
in partners and maybe a an
ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend has
consistently ruined events that they've
come to but they still like you but
let's see let's see i was told it was
because my relationship wasn't serious
enough despite us being together for a
year that only engaged or married
couples were invited
and that they didn't want some random
guy in their wedding pictures who i
might not even be with later in the
future they don't want to have to look
at some random guy in their photos even
though
he wouldn't have been in any of the post
pictures at all maybe just in the
background of crowd shots
that is that's very funny um
and and almost i mean yeah if you're
if you're having a wedding you know you
you want the people that are at least in
the
the wedding party photos to i guess be
as stable as possible um
but that is it does sound like uh and i
think you should leave post
he's not a guy is bozo bozo's in the
photo
there have been no conflicts between
them and my boyfriend and he's a nice
and mild-mannered guy who gets along
with everyone so i don't think it was
about him personally
i get to the ceremony find out literally
everyone else has a plus one not just
married couples but there are couples
there who have been dating for
less time than me this is when i started
feeling
surly i smiled and played my part during
the ceremony but inside i was very surly
and angry
we then got to the reception which had
way more people than the ceremony
seems of course why i mean the ceremony
is boring
the reception's where all the fun
happens
this is where all the more distant
friends
were invited and everyone there had a
plus one i was literally placed at a
table as the own oh the one single
person
everyone else at the table was a couple
some at the table were other members of
the wedding party but others were random
distant acquaintances
people started asking me where my
boyfriend was and i said i was told he
wasn't invited they asked why and i said
i had no idea
this is where i started letting my
surliness show and started
acting rude and mean because i was
humiliated
um yeah that seems fair and then
i was brought into conversation with the
couple's male friend dean
i was previously told that dean had a
crush on me
and i made it clear i wouldn't be
interested even if i were single even
after that he kept trying to message me
and i ignored him but now the people who
brought me into the conversation were
standing around at us staring and
giggling behind their backs
behind their hands behind their hands
like they thought they were cupid
matchmakers i was
meaner to dean than i've ever been to
anyone else in my entire life
oh sorry i need to scroll down a little
if you'll excuse me
i was meaner to dean than i've ever been
to anyone in my entire life
i was as fully rude as i've ever wanted
to be when the target of someone's
when being the target of someone's
romantic interest unwantedly it's true i
don't really know if i was being set up
but i was already furious before that
happened
um yeah you're not obviously not the
can i tell you i the only reason you
would be the is for posting this
when you're so obviously not the
i'm i feel baited into reading this post
for there to be any kind of like meat on
the bone to
talk about when in reality it's so
obviously
like you're not the and
everybody else is a piece of garbage
here
that you you kind of become maybe not
the but maybe like
a small jerk small jerk energy s-s-j-e
um i do want us oh i i need to i need to
open the comments in the future
if dean wasn't in on the plan then it's
not okay to be mean to him
um yeah
okay i mean that's true we we can't
suggest
necessarily that uh dean was in on this
we don't know
um but then again dean made it clear he
wouldn't be interested
or i wouldn't be interested even if i
were single but he kept trying to
message me
i don't know it sounds like he was kind
of creeping i don't have an answer for
you here that is anything that is
that is even mildly controversial
sounds like dean was a little bit suss
yeah also how was dean there
by himself if everybody had a plus one
it really a little bit of an unreliable
narrator perhaps
and it says literally everyone there had
a plus one
maybe dean's creeping or maybe not
literally everybody there had a plus one
who knows
don't lie to me dean let me see if i can
find one
oh i i love i was gonna say i love these
because the the title was am i the
 for banning my mother-in-law
from my house but then it literally
starts with like a
very tragic story we gotta find some
for some i am the
i gotta scroll so much just to see the
first one oh
no okay here we go this is
am i the maybe we'll sort by
rising a little later today as well
am i the for telling my partner
that my stepson spends too much time at
our home and his mother needs to make
more of an effort
everyone sucks okay i'm
i'm excited already okay i've been
dating this guy now for nearly eight
months
we've been living together for two
everything was going great we're like
best friends
we had hey let me just start by saying
everything was going great followed by
a 13 000 upvote everybody sucks here am
i the post is a little bit
was everything going great especially i
mean
it seems like it's been
i don't know you know what i'm not gonna
give relationship advice because what do
i know
we're best friends we have so much in
common his four-year-old son is now
proving to be a bit of a strain on our
relationship and i feel like i can't
take him anywhere
no really a four-year-old kid being a
little bit of a
strain on your relationship that scene
come on this kids they honestly it
sounds like the kid kind of sucks here
what's that oh let me all feed me feed
me teach me things play with me come on
man
can you can't even go out to the club
there's they kick out miners at like 9
p.m
his son throws tantrums slams doors when
he doesn't get what he wants
smashing the glass on my sister's door
when we buy him things he says i didn't
want that or i don't like it
when we take him to a store he picks up
everything i i just need to kind of stop
already and say is
the way you're describing like you're
writing this post
to get ready to judge your
four-year-olds even if they are your
stepchild is a little bit of uh
it's a weird energy like you're writing
you're not just like they behave badly
you're writing an essay that's like
please start to dislike my child yo dan
thank you for the raid
this is you could weigh in on this one
dan the the title of this post is am i
the
 for telling my partner that my
stepson spends too much time at our
house and his mother needs to make more
of an effort
so they're four-year-old oh they're just
they're honestly it sounds like their
four-year-old's kind of the here
he picks up everything he sees and
throws tantrums when he doesn't get them
spits his food out when we cook for him
tells us he doesn't like us
making my seven-year-old niece cry when
he says horrible things to her as well
as throwing her things
off of our balcony etc he's a nightmare
let me just add that his dad always has
to buy him new toys every time he takes
him out which i told him he shouldn't
his mother is now treating us like a
daycare she had him for one day last
week
and having him for two next week while
she goes on holiday with her new
boyfriend and going out with friends
okay you've said the stage look you
might be going a little bit
over top over the top here with the
insults to your four-year-old stepchild
however
you know you got to put yourself in the
in the four-year-old shoes as well
you know that there are only four and
they are already living with like a new
mother figure like of course they're
they're acting out a little bit
plus they're four my partner is now
currently unemployed and i'm the main
breadwinner and struggling to support
all three of us do to have to buying
doing due to having to buy extra food
and more gas and electric usage
this is something that i always end up
looking
uh maybe a little bit
like i'm in a bubble on this because i
electricity is pretty
cheap where i live the idea that like i
mean if you added like an extra
four-year-old to your electric bill i
have to imagine that it
over here would probably be like 20 a
month
you give the kid a bath every other day
and i
i don't even know like what are they
using the ipad all the time
kids obviously not stoked yeah they mine
in bitcoins your four-year-old mine and
bitcoins on their little
microsoft surface yo spinning machine
thanks
for the gifted subs thank you
sorry sorry
more gas and electric usage i'm also
woken up at 7am every saturday and
sunday because my stepson wants the ipad
charging or more games downloading when
weekends are supposed to be my time
after working all day monday to friday i
don't finish until 8pm
this is something i have some sympathy
for but i also just have to say that
that's like
that's what what you get when you have
kids like when you're
in your 20s you don't have kids i guess
it doesn't have to be in your 20s
when you work five six days a week you
get to be a little bit more protective
of your day off
uh when you are in an arrangement where
you're also taking care of a child the
child's interests uh
take precedent over you whether you got
to get up at 7 a.m or otherwise
i told my partner this has to stop and
my place cannot be treated like a
daycare he needs to either take him out
weekends or rotate it so we have him
every other weekend
i feel like my life has been taken over
as well as my apartment as his son has
his own bedroom and my things have been
taken out of drawers and placed in
plastic bags which i'm now living out of
i need more information about this as
well this what
i don't understand what the why your
stuff has been taken out of drawers and
placed into plastic bags
i mean
be that as it may uh my partner is
struggling being away from his son and i
feel horrible for giving him ultimatums
but i feel i need to look after myself
too as i did
as i never did in my last relationship i
suffer from depression and anxiety i
feel this whole situation is making
things worse
am i the well
uh my let's look at the edits first okay
i'm not trying to stop my partner from
seeing his son i'm merely implying the
kid needs
routine and equal time with both mom and
dad on rotating days in which my partner
also agrees
i know they come as a package and i'm
willing to take this on but neither
parent is financially supporting this
child
okay i think that i i agree with the
flair that everybody sucks here imo
uh you're it it sounds like based on the
post
your boyfriend should take a more
uh serious role in raising
his own son especially like uh
you know you are in a relationship with
somebody that has a kid that's gonna
change your life for sure
but you have also only been dating for
eight months like expecting your
girlfriend of eight months to be such a
dependable mother figure for your child
who is super young and
perhaps has some behavioral issues is a
little bit of an move for sure
you know it's gonna it's gonna take some
time to adjust to that for
for everybody involved um
i have no idea what's going on with the
the birth mother so i mean it sounds
like the the birth mother is painted in
a very negative
light here but maybe she's been watching
the kid like crazy
for a year and now she's going on
vacation for a week after
two years of the pandemic you know that
doesn't make her a bad mother
necessarily if there's other
if there's the infrastructure in place
for other people to watch
apart from that i'm like i the only
reason that i'm like
she's kind of a an is a result
of the fact that
she just dedicates like an entire
paragraph to the four-year-old being
badly behaved and i'm like yeah they're
four
my baby shits her pants
two times a day when i try to change her
diaper she rolls around and making it
that much harder to clean no matter how
many times i tell her
stop rolling she keeps rolling am i the
for saying stop crapping your pants like
it's a little kid
but i i do i will say i this is like the
second post this week
already hold on i'm just opening the the
comments here i always want to see if
there's some spiciness but
um that's the second comment this week
that was like uh
you know i get one day off and i'm
so sick of having the seven days a week
care about a child and i'm like i get
that it's not
your biological kid but it's a package
deal in the relationship
that's what having a kid is like you
know seven days a week
you got to do some kid related
responsibilities you know you don't get
hey i worked till eight last night honey
can you just like you know
cook yourself lunch she's four years old
she can't even you know hit the knobs
on the on the stove anyway scroll down
for the update
oh you guys couldn't oh sorry sorry
update my partner has landed himself a
job we've had to talk about his son's
behavior my partner decided to stop
spoiling him
and reward him only for good behavior my
partner is also going to speak to his ex
about the lack of time she's spending
with him
found out the few days she does have him
she's taking him to her mom's and
leaving him there
look again it's good it's good that you
communicated all right
that's what i'm going to say about that
i am going to say that the update
certainly appears to take absolutely no
responsibility
and also i would like to hear about
things from the uh
the mother's side but
[Laughter]
because it's it she's like a fringe
character in this whole story
where we're like uh you know i hate that
lady
that has been described by her
ex-husband's
new girlfriend as being such a selfish
 anyway
um everybody sucks here your house isn't
being treated like a daycare it's being
treated like the home of a child's
parent you're in a relationship with a
parent you need to come to terms with
the fact that he might wind up
with his kid full time or you need to
not be in a relationship with a parent
little kids get up early and if that
bothers you you shouldn't be living with
the kid and his parent
not at all reasonable to tell the child
to tell the parent the child needs to
not exist in your space
yeah that seems fair
your partner sucks are putting you in a
position where you're living out of bags
in your own home
i i do wish that you would also have
told me
um why why the bags i don't under like
they took
your adult stuff out of the drawers to
put the child's
uh stuff into the drawers i'm not
saying this is a situation where maybe
you just buy another chest of drawers i
just gotta know why it's in bags
like do you do you live in like uh is
your house
half submerged with like ankle high
water where you can't just put stuff on
the ground
i don't i don't understand but anyway
one of these days we'll figure it out no
questions about the bags please
colorectal surgeon that's how you know
like they got their head screwed on
straight
here's the thing he's not gonna change
this is how he parents this is how he
deals with his ex
you've been dating less than a year and
this guy already has you supporting him
you're feeling mental health effects
you're struggling financially
looking after yourself is the correct
choice the way you're doing it is not
okay
okay so that's a very nice way for him
to say uh
either tell your boyfriend to shape up
or break up i think
but i feel like a lot of these posts are
like just break up
um and hey i don't think that's fair to
say that he's not gonna change
you know i i feel like maybe you did the
best assumption
is that he's not gonna change and you
should you know maybe operate
under that assumption but simultaneously
i'm like that's a little rude to the
boyfriend yeah plus the update says he
promised that he would whether or not he
actually will who knows but still
all right well at least we got some meat
on that one i can always respect the
little meat
hold on i'm i'm looking for more oh oh
this is
oh this is good stuff
things are getting spicy
love the music too man just adds another
extra element
am i the for telling my friend
her birthday is annoying
my 19 year old friend my i'm 19 my
friend's
birthday my it just doesn't roll off the
tongue very well
poster is 19 friend is 18. my friend
celebrates her birthday for an entire
week every year
she grew up really spoiled and still is
to be honest and she says it's normal
her reasoning is that she has too many
friends so she can't see them all in the
same day and she doesn't want to mix her
friend groups for a big party
so she just goes out with everyone
separately for an entire week
how many times has this happened if
she's only 18
i mean from zero to like
six the birthday parties are basically
just like come over eat some dairy queen
ice cream cake and then from like six
until
12 nobody's going out and like oh i
gotta i'm having
seven birthday parties or something like
 this only happened like a few times
i'm not jealous or anything but it's
ridiculous
she'll basically i'm not jealous or
anything but it's ridiculous
she'll basically be unavailable that
entire week because she has to
see everyone also she acts like a
princess all the time but it's
especially prominent during
birthday week on her b day like that
actual day
she even wears one of those blingy
tiaras as part of her outfit
she was definitely one of those girls
that brings balloons to her
to school on her birthday it sounds like
you hate this person and you should not
be friends
so i mean literally at no point have you
mentioned any positivity in your
relationship
anything that enhances you know the
quality of life for either of you
it's just uh are you being forced under
under threat of incarceration to be
friends i don't understand
also she posts instagram stories to
thank
everyone for their gifts and time like
we don't care your dad got you a car
or whatever and she gets upset if
someone she thought she was close with
forgets her birthday she won't lash out
or tell them anything
but she'll be like wow so-and-so forgot
anyways all this is really childish
sometimes you hit the nail on the head
and i told her that her birthday week is
extremely childish and annoying and that
i won't be participating
and she said it's fine but stopped
replying to my texts or answering my
calls to hang out i think she's upset
even though she tried to pass it off as
it's fine read it am i the
okay and then here's your update
the problem i apostrophe s because her
birthday
that i'm not even mad about this this is
an auto correct situation where like
we're now at a point where autocorrect
um
suggests incorrect spellings rather than
the correct spelling more than it
actually helps you out so i'm gonna
blame the phone for this
the problem is because her birthday is
always over the top and everyone makes a
huge deal oh it's her name's birthday
next week we better be obnoxious and not
shut up about it
also if gifts don't matter to her why is
she posting about it rather than
thanking the people in private or over
text
wow i forgot what it was like
to have uh no real problems in your life
maybe that's judgmental but i i
i'm being teleported backwards into like
my teenage years
and when you would be preoccupied with
like
nothing you would think you would obsess
for hours about absolutely nothing
as if it was the largest deal of all
time
um you're definitely the
your friend's uh birthday
is who cares i mean like
i know that so i do see some people
saying like everybody sucks here
you can dislike her friend because like
it sounds like she's
rich and her friend her dad is buying
her a car but like
this she's 18 years old what do you like
what do you want her to do don't
if if you got a car if you're 18 years
old you got a car you might post a tweet
or an instagram uh
story or something and be like you know
thanks for the car
you're you're a teenager
now that i'm you know in my 30s if
somebody gave me an expensive gift i
would never tell anybody
because i'm trying not to make myself a
target for you know
robberies and muggings but as a teenager
you're you know you're flexing you're
trying to establish your identity
she's 18 years old she's basically a
child is i guess what i'm trying to say
um but the way that the the amount of
offense that op
is taking to her supposed friend
uh celebrating her birthday too much
this is the kind of thing you think
about and maybe you talk about
in the group chat uh but you definitely
don't go like
hey we're friends right so i can tell
you anything uh the way you celebrate
your birthday is extremely childish and
annoying and i won't be participating
definitely makes you uh the
mod post first off explore new criminal
possibilities in red dead online by the
way
all with no upfront investment necessary
play now
locked because quite frankly i want to
enjoy my weekend
reddit mods everywhere have they have
the same energy
you're the it sounds like your
friend isn't intentionally hurting
anyone
she might even be trying to accommodate
everyone by spacing out different means
of celebrating her birthday across a
week so everyone could get more
personalized
time with her look i'm gonna tell you my
hunch is that her friend is spoiled and
maybe a little bit
uh hungry for attention and i think that
this person is replying and being very
generous and optimistic but
they are also 18 years old and who cares
you know just just because it sounds
like her friend's a little bit hungry
for attention that doesn't mean
uh you know she's a bad person
how you attempt to justify your
perception that she acts like a princess
comes down to her seemingly being
excited about turning a new age
and maybe having a big personality it
seems like your friend's way of
celebrating what she considers a
significant event and how she expresses
herself isn't for you and that's okay
yet it can be rude and unexpected to
push your judgments on her
about a birthday that doesn't have to
concern you if you don't want to do it
if you don't want it to do so all in all
her birthday week isn't about you and
it's not supposed to be she's worthy of
all the kinds of celebrations she
desires rather than the lack thereof you
want for her
what the hell are you talking about
you're right but why
bold this is such live laugh love energy
like maybe i'm the now
but the fact that it's bold and
italicized
on top of the actual wording involved
here
what do you mean she's worthy of the
celebration she desires you don't know
who this lady is
couldn't you just say it's her like
it's her birthday you know it doesn't
concern you i don't know why you've
turned it into some kind of
you know mantra but anyway
i mean this is just i'm just surprised
could have taken that one back to the
drawing board um i'm just seeing oh my
god it's it's fostered a lot of
discussion that's for sure
you're the you do sound jealous
it's one week a year you don't even have
to be a part of it
since she's basically unavailable for
the week you don't have to participate
so just send your gift bow out of events
and temporarily hide her on social media
it's not that big of a deal let her
enjoy her birthday yeah
exactly why do you care
it also does not sound like they're uh
like they're friends okay that was a
good one dude the the
i am the ones are they're so
much more entertaining
i some of these i like when the
thumbnail or the the title
doesn't lie to you maybe yeah we'll get
some gray area questions going later if
we can
like filter by controversial maybe
because i'm trying to think
normally on reddit when you filter by
controversial
it's actually like just the worst
you'll ever see in your life
i feel like on a subreddit designed to
make judgments
filtering by controversial might
actually give you the highest quality
posts but i might be
uh i might be incorrect
we'll see either way okay this one is a
guarantee
am i the for being shot that my
friend will get married before me
i have this friend let's call her jane
because her name's jane
we're in our mid-30s now but we were
roommates since freshman year of college
she's one of my closest friends and i
know her super well
and i know that for oliver 20 she had
horrendous luck with her love life and
was extremely
insecure about it she always wanted to
get married and have kids kept ending up
with douchebags who would cheat on her
or
man who straight up didn't like her
daddy issues
and crying about it and i was always
there for her through it and reassuring
her how she won't die alone
but her love life kind of became a punch
line i was always
there for her telling her she's not
gonna die alone
that being said her love life was a
little bit of a punch line in our group
of friends
everyone was there she laughed about it
too she had a fun time
oh that's so good sometimes she'd go
along with it especially once she got
into her 30s and was still single
she'd say like haha yeah guys we all
know i'm gonna die alone all the time
and i know she was torn up about it but
we were always reassuring her that it's
not the case and she was in therapy
about it
oh oh that sentence is so
let me try again but her love life kind
of became a punchline in our group of
friends and sometimes she'd go along
with it especially once she got into her
30s and was still single
she'd say like haha yeah guys we all
know i'm gonna die alone all the time
and i know she was torn up about it but
we were always reassuring her that it's
not the case and she was in therapy
about it
anyways about a year ago she finally met
an incredible man and they fell in love
almost instantly
he proposed to her last week and she's
just completely over the moon i've never
seen her this happy
this weekend we all went out to
celebrate and all our friends were
saying how we're so happy for her after
a long and difficult road
it was really emotional for context i'm
single
no boyfriend and i want to get married
too but i'm not a pathology
like she was
and so i said i can't believe jane will
get married before me she started crying
and stormed out and the evening was
completely spoiled i tried calling her
this weekend but she was hysterical
and said that i didn't have to point out
that she's so unlovable and it's a
miracle she tricked someone into
proposing
jane jane have you not have you
forgotten
about the fact that your love life is a
punchline in our group
jane come on jane have you forgotten
about how we always used to make fun of
you for
that the fact that you wouldn't ever get
married and you die alone and then we
were like i'm just kidding
have you forgotten about all the fun
jokes we had about you
living alone for the rest of your life
it's quite sad dot dot dot but that's
not what i meant that's her own baggage
that's
i'm not a pathology like she was by the
way i apologize but also suggested she
should talk to her therapist
hey i'm sorry if my joke offended you
have you ever considered uh that your
reaction might be
something you take up with a mental
health professional because i don't
think that i did anything wrong
uh and now she completely refuses to
speak to me and won't answer my messages
a couple others in our friend group are
on her side
well some have said that she's
overreacting and will come around am i
the
wow this is um pretty bad uh
like not the no people in chat are like
it's the worst person i've ever seen
she's not a war criminal um
but maybe that's because she hasn't had
the opportunity
to be yet in such a small like domestic
social situation she's already proven
herself a
bad judge of character i would say just
to begin with so
for anybody you know that's treating
this as instructive rather than merely
why would we suggest op is the
in this situation
look it
is the start of this is a little
complicated the end is very simple okay
the first thing i would say is you gotta
when you make jokes with your friends
about things that they're actually
sensitive about
you gotta you know be very very careful
okay like even with close friends like
mouth and i will banter
we'll make fun of each other there's
things that i would
you know take more offense to mouth
making fun of me for not baldness for
example i don't know but something else
and there's things that might hurt mouse
feelings that i could say
and you just the the spirit of
friendship is like
bantering but also knowing that you know
you shouldn't cross that line
and it kind of sounds like uh
you know jane for names have been
changed to protect the innocent
uh how has a complex about the fact that
she thought she was gonna die alone
based on the fact that she was actually
in therapy
uh about it and yet you and the rest of
your friends treating it as a punchline
pretty bad that's that that's already
like
at the very least a bit of a spicy gray
area
um then
when she's happy to be like i can't
believe
jane got married before me is
really bad when all you have to do is
not make it about you
and instead be like congratulations
like how hard is that and then just have
a good night and then
the the triple down is like i respect it
but also
it's horrible when she said uh
i kind of apologize but also i suggested
you should talk to your therapist about
it
i don't need i i mean sometimes i'll
make a joke someone will take real
offense to it
and i want in my head i'm like oh come
on you baby
maybe you should talk to your therapist
about it but you never say it out loud
you just go
i'm sorry i didn't think about the that
what i said would affect your feelings
like that
you know it's not that's part of like
what it's like to be
an adult and have friends is you you
spend some time
apologizing for things that you think
the other person's overreacting about
but they're reacting that way because
it's like about their feelings
instead of you know about yours like her
feelings are
hurt because of what you said and then
your feelings are hurt because of the
fact
that her feelings are hurt like who's
who's in the wrong there i think that's
an easy one
anyway yeah so she's like the super
 no question
um wow major you're the here
sounds like there's some jealousy going
on that jane is getting married while
you're still single
her love life should never have been a
punch line you and your friends
contributed to her insecurities who
responds to a proposal like this
wouldn't be surprised if jane cuts you
off altogether
agreed this this user was awarded
reddit gold for this post wholesome
award
so much this up dudes to the left
my gentle sir but then
i do like that on am i the
people like go for the jugular vein
who knows maybe op's disgusting attitude
is the reason men don't find her
attractive
oh i'm sure of it no one likes a bitter
jealous
bully like that
she was rude for sure in her comments
at the same time that's a little over
the top
it's the classic like internet thing
right where like someone makes
uh behaves badly in public or they
engages in like a social faux pas
and people are like yeah they should be
killed maybe i think
and everyone's like so true 1.7 000
upvotes
anyway people have suggested go to
am i the filtered and that is
like the
that's got the best posts let's see
there's so much this



am i the [ __ ] filtered only the most
interesting am i the [ __ ] posts there
we go now we can get into some
discussions
only the most interesting i don't want
cut in dry situations
i want it to be like i i want to have
some people
get upset and disagree with me even
though i'm right
uh but then i do look at the top post
here and it says am i the [ __ ] for
calling a pregnant woman an incubator
and refusing to talk to her
[Laughter]
i will also say um as i
as i open this up here i have an ad
is the weirdest ad i've ever seen
it's time stay connected with floyd
money mayweather himself on
only fans
is that what that website's for
also is that what floyd mayweather is
doing now
[Laughter]
do i am i mistaken on
on what the website is is for maybe yes
maybe no
it also gave me a hello fresh ad so
things are all uh
all out of whack right now maybe it's my
my wife's way of
telling me that my cooking isn't up to
snuff
anyway am i the [ __ ] for calling a
pregnant woman
an incubator and refusing to talk to her
let's find out
i 23 year old non-binary visited my
family this summer
my this is so long oh my god
[Laughter]
my family and i are all vaccinated so my
parents wanted to hold a small
fourth of july gathering i can already
tell where this
is going strap in okay this is a little
this is getting a little spicy my family
and i are all vaccinated so my parents
wanted to hold a small fourth of july
gathering
unfortunately a couple who are openly
homophobic transphobic and sexist was
also invited
i came out to my parents as non-binary
and bisexual last summer but they don't
really understand
lgbtq identities due to language
barriers
however i was hoping that coming out to
them would encourage them to cut ties
from this couple
okay so this is like you can't pick your
family
and this is already uh a tangled web
that's being woven here
lo and behold the two showed up at the
fourth of july gathering the woman
proceeded to ask nonstop about when i
will be getting a boyfriend so my
parents can have grandchildren
she firmly bases her whole identity
around being a mother
she has three kids and is currently
pregnant with another and kept talking
about how if i wait too long i'll lose
the chance to be a mother
she also implied that women's sole
purpose is to birth and raise the next
generation and that women who work are
selfish i became frustrated and blurted
out
good thing i'm not a woman and that i
don't ever want kids
she froze for a second kind of looked me
up and down trying to see if i was
obviously transitioning and then left
okay this is the kind of thing where
you're like
it's it's not my ideal of a good
fourth of july
[Laughter]
feels like this would probably be a
situation where you may be uh start
having your own
uh gatherings and celebrations if this
is gonna keep happening
i was left alone for a couple minutes
until the couple all came
to confront me i reiterated i was
non-binary don't ask me about children
that seems
completely fair then the woman tried to
argue with me
so i turned to her husband and asked him
why is your baby incubator still trying
to talk to me doesn't it have something
else to be doing
uh honestly kind of based
it's maybe not quite at the same level
of uh
the watermelon ass come back but
if it's real that's it's a little based
everyone heard me say that who hurried
and
including my parents who hurried over to
see what was going on
i told them what happened i was tired of
being bothered by their friends then i
left
after that the party fizzled out yeah i
know what you're saying there
you're like not only did i drop a sick
comeback
but when i left the party fizzled
if i'm not there it's dead
i saw the way you snuck that in there is
not only did i own them
but i also killed the party on the way
out
my parents tried to apologize on my
behalf but the couple left almost
immediately and everyone else just
trickled out because it was awkward
previously the woman has talked about
how women should remain silent when
there are men
talking so my reasoning is that i was
simply using her own beliefs against her
i mean it's if it's a shower come back
it's a shower come back but
i mean she's kind of she's got her there
if this really happened
she she used the woman's own reasoning
against her
she pulled the ben shapiro on her
without a doubt
my mother thinks that i'm the [ __ ]
for coming out during a party instead of
keeping the peace when i know they are
lgbtq phobic
i would say that that is a pretty
invalid reason
calling the woman an incubator may be a
little rude
simultaneously though a little based
sorry they
is my mistake
calling the woman an incubator
simultaneously
while rude
kind of an own stressing a pregnant
woman out
literally you can't take responsibility
for that take it from me
they get stressed out over everything
oh oh there's no dill pickle ice cream
left over
oh this uh little baby inside of my
stomach is kicking all my organs around
all the time
like you you can't help but stress him
out from time to time now i mean just
getting into a
verbal altercation it's a little bit
different story but
causing her to lose a friend my sister
thinks the incubator comment was
hilarious but thinks i'm an [ __ ] for
calling the woman an it
i don't want to misgender people but it
was the best way to get my point across
to someone who thinks women are property
i don't know what to say about that one
but uh i mean
it sounds like your sister is on the
same level from a humorous standpoint at
least as you are
after a couple of days of fierce
arguments in my parents house i returned
home but my parents keep blowing up my
phone
i do think she deserved it and it was
the best way to get them to stop talking
to me i don't want to apologize am i the
[ __ ]
um so this
is i i like this thread
okay you know why because it's spicy
it's controversial my immediate hunch
after reading this is not the [ __ ]
it's if we take the story of face value
it seems like
you tried to make it known you were not
comfortable with the discussion that was
happening
you maybe even specifically said please
stop bringing that up to me
then they wouldn't and you know they
appeared at least from your perception
to be rude at which point
you delivered a nuclear level insults
that the person that was the
architect of this you know interaction
to begin with
can't even argue with because it used
their own logic against them
so i i'm big into the not the [ __ ]
camp here
it sounds like you you laid the
groundwork said please stop talking to
me about this
and then you know defeated them with
facts and logic
although i appreciate the support of
everyone who said i was not the [ __ ]
oh no now i'm there they're going to
turn the tables on me
after some reflection and reading
through this threat i've decided to
apologize to my parents for the blow up
but not apologize to the couple
based and reality pill i accept that i
was an [ __ ]
even if justified i recognize how my
comments could have caused others to
feel bad about pregnancy or family
without context and there was probably a
better way to handle the situation
i was already dealing with other
situations at the time and it just
exploded out of me
taking the high road was the last thing
on my mind after dealing with similar
incidents politely in the past
not the [ __ ] at all like this just
very reasonable sounds like you're
bringing much more decorum to this than
than the older couple did in the first
place you know that this is just a very
normal way to respond to this
the final verdict is everyone sucks
not the [ __ ] 54 percent
everybody sucks here 37 you're the
[ __ ] eight percent
i don't i don't know why the verdict is
everybody sucks here then i feel like
that's uh
they gotta work on their algorithm but
popular vote lost again yeah it was it
did those those dang
swing states man florida voted for
everybody sucks here
stop the count oh dude this is so much
better
like these ones that are a little bit
spicy inevitably
one day it's gonna lead to some
controversy and i'm gonna be annoyed and
kill this segment forever
however for the time being i love it
am i the [ __ ] for telling my friend's
wife to eat a salad
probably
maybe she was just hungry
my wife has a friend that she's had
since high school in high school they
were both around 105 pounds
i'm sure that this is what
your wife has told you but it's just
very
weird knowledge uh to
know how much your wife's friend weighed
in high school
that is i have no information about
what any of my wife's friends weigh to
begin with but the fact that they uh
know what they weighed in high school
and have used that in the first sentence
is a little much
anyway just just strange energy from the
start however since then the friend has
gained an
excessive amount of weight and is closer
to 200 to 215
what are you like one of those guys at
the fair that guesses how much someone
weighs just by looking at them
my wife is very health-conscious and
always works out so even though she's in
her mid-30s she still looks around 19-20
and is very toned in fit and weighs only
around 120 pounds
why is it it's so
so much focus on the numbers so far
i like i just don't know why
you have to point out that your wife
looks like she's 19 to 20 anyway
anytime her friend sees her she makes
comments about my wife being too skinny
and she needs to eat
uh glory gear it bothers my wife and
pisses me off when she does this
well we moved across the country years
ago so she only deals with it every
couple years when she comes to visit
well the last time she was here she
wasted no time busting out the
blurred gear comments after we picked
her up from the airport we stopped for
lunch as soon as
we sat down she pointed to the poor gear
section and told my wife she should
order something from there
as soon as she said it i pointed out
that they have several salad options and
she should really
consider ordering one now everyone is
pissed am i the [ __ ]
okay you don't look at the you don't
look at the results yet you gotta give
your own opinion first
okay um
i do think
and i think this is where we might get
into some disagreement
i think op is the [ __ ]
to be honest now are they
out of line are they wrong
i don't know that's a little bit more uh
that's not the question right the
question is
are they an [ __ ] what's an [ __ ]
you know kind of going over the top with
a
hay maker when when you're in public and
you're you're talking with your friends
you kind of just jab a little bit
you know you you don't go for the the
knockout that ends somebody's career you
just kind of try to
wound their pride slightly and then you
know make a joke at your own expense as
well
if you and here's the thing
i feel like maybe the husband or the op
in this situation is like
my wife keeps talking to me
about how annoying it is that her friend
keeps telling her to eat a burger
however
it probably is worse for your wife
that now you've made a joke at her
friend's
expense so now the whole situation is
awkward
whereas what could have happened instead
is you just go
ah no i think i'm just gonna get a salad
she eats a burger and then you go home
and go that was fun
i do wish you stopped talking about the
burger stuff though
but i feel like there's a better way to
solve this problem
um you you kind of got you got
needled a little bit just a little
needling
and then you replied with like a
hydrogen bomb so i think
i think that they're the [ __ ]
not a major [ __ ] issue but i i think
they're the [ __ ]
um but i do have to say
the final verdict
not the [ __ ] 45 everybody sucks here
42
you're the [ __ ] 10 what the heck is
oh
nah is no [ __ ] of course there'd be
zero percent
there's gotta be an [ __ ] i do think
that this
look i i can't necessarily suggest that
i have data to back this up
but i think that my hunch is that given
the
demographics of reddit uh
a guy landing
what they perceive to be a justified
ribbing at someone's weight
especially his wife's friend probably
inflates these numbers a little bit
whereas in real life i feel like we'd
probably be a little bit
honestly i'm surprised that there's only
10
of people that are like you're the
[ __ ]
am i like the only well no i'm i'm part
of the 10
i guess but i didn't think that the
proportion of people that was
that understand this is so low at home
you
[ __ ] about everything i don't like this
i don't like that
hey yo i had a great time at dinner did
you notice what they ordered really and
then they scraped the stuff off what did
they do
you don't get to and then like the fact
that you talk about that stuff in the
privacy of your
own home is one thing um but then to go
out and be like hey how about you stop
scraping the lettuce off your burger
you know like that's just you don't have
to bring up every minor grievance that
you have with everybody else
you know you gotta you gotta keep some
social decorum going i'm i'm realizing
now that i'm
and all the other thing is that you're
the [ __ ] thing here it's just the way
he
i don't see why it matters that his wife
looks like she's 19 to 20.
i just find it an unnecessary
uh comment that is
a normal unnecessary comment would be
one thing but it's just weird that he
that he brings it up
it's like my wife who looks 19 by the
way
she looks 19 by the way and she only
weighs about 120 pounds
she only weighs about 120 pounds
anyway um this guy's got triples of the
nova
for sure no question
no i'm doing react court
okay
triples of the nova um
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our
house cleaner to clean her house
three days before her due date when she
needs the money
the other thing about these am i the
[ __ ] filtered posts
is like they're so specific as to be
very real
[Laughter]
it's like normally you wouldn't be like
uh
some of them are like am i the [ __ ]
for uh punching a racist in the face and
you're like no of course not
and then these are like am i the [ __ ]
for making a left turn
on an amber light when the car in front
of me was slow to go through
and also it was raining on the and
you're like okay
you come here here come your eyes
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our
house cleaner to clean our they're also
so much shorter sometimes
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our
house cleaner to clean our house three
days before her due date when she needs
the money
you know what's funny is that just
looking at this to begin with
i would have said not the [ __ ]
absolutely not
um when we had our first kid but seeing
how much more casual sips was about
having his third kid
and he was just like he played rocket
league on monday and then garlic on
tuesday and then like
wednesday at 1 a.m they had the kid i'm
like you know what maybe i was uh
a little bit maybe i was like a little
bit more uh
prepared for the baby than you
necessarily have to be but
i think that's just how it goes for the
firstborn anyway
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our
house cleaner to clean our house three
days before her due date when she needs
the money
sometimes our so hires a cleaning
service for our home
the woman who owns it is in her third
trimester and is due in five days
she was supposed to come today but she
texted us tonight apologizing because
she was in the hospital the cleaner is
asking if she can come to work on
saturday
my significant other wants to take her
up on this but i'm vehemently against it
at the end of the day it's the cleaners
decision on what she wants to do
and she has to do what is best for her
family i just don't feel right hiring
her to work so close to her due date out
of concern for her health
have considered the idea of paying in
advance but that feels awkward
edit we'll add that she does come with
help
so she would not be alone to clean um
i have no idea
you know what i i actually i i stole
this from chad but i think you're right
um i think this is no [ __ ]
i think this is a no [ __ ] present
situation
uh i also
would feel weird about someone cleaning
my house when they were three days
before their due date
it's not really like it's already
awkward
to begin with when you have somebody
else clean your house because you're
like either we're gonna leave or we're
gonna stay there
and i always feel like like they're
judging me for
not helping to begin with but even
though that's not the way it's supposed
to go
so then add in the fact that the woman
is 39.5 weeks out of 40 pregnant
like you're really gonna just sit on the
couch
while uh well a woman that's three days
away from having a baby
cleans your whole house
[Laughter]
i don't think so that would make me
uncomfortable so i don't think the guy
is necessarily the [ __ ] for that
situation
that's and i'm saying that not even like
because of the fact that you know she
could go into labor in your house like
you know
i mean if her water broke while she was
cleaning up
she's already got the mop out so if
anything you're kind of getting two
birds stoned at once
moving on um that being said
i the only i i relate to this comment
however
it's very funny to me have considered
the idea of paying in advance but that
just feels awkward
and i don't think it's that awkward i
think you just
pay her the advance and then move on
like if she needs the money especially
you know you got a relationship with
the cleaning service like it's not
awkward just hey here's your payment
and then you'll get me back when you
like it what it actually sounds like is
you're worried if you give her the
advance that she's going to be like
psych you're never gonna see me again
but uh this is just i there's not that
much meat on the bone here
it's just uh
i mean i just get i i know what i'm
at the road i'm going down here but just
give her the advance
she wants to work three days before the
due date
because she wants the money not because
she's like i'm so
passionate that even having a bowling
ball
inside of my abdomen is not gonna stop
me right it's not like she's doing it
for the love of the game
so just pay her the advance and she'll
get you back
like six weeks later or something like
that it's like
it's i feel like the world is the
[ __ ]
for her feeling compelled to do it to
begin with but
you should i think you pay i think you
came up to your solution you know you
just you just pay the advance here
take me back am i the [ __ ] for asking
my girlfriend not to rub her hairy leg
against me when i'm in bed
oh this one's got it you can tell to
begin with this one's gonna be good
because the headline is so vague there's
no way this person is not the [ __ ] am
i the [ __ ] for refusing to
inconvenience myself over someone else's
problem
most of the posts are like you know am i
the [ __ ] for punching somebody in the
face and then when they add context
you're like
not the [ __ ] this one is like
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to
inconvenience myself over someone else's
problem
you know this is this is gonna be [ __ ]
man
okay here we go
recently i moved into a new flat with a
friend we've looked into renting a flat
specifically with the balcony because we
are both smokers
to be honest i'd probably be okay with
smoking in my room
okay um
that i don't think that's like why
they you have to get a balcony is
because you're not okay with smelling
the smoke that you make
i think it's because you know be
be that as it may about how chad feels
about landlords i think they're more
like
you know we don't want the curtains to
turn yellow regardless
i roll my own cigarettes mcbaron choice
if anyone's interested
anyone that don't have any horrid smell
but usually landlords forbid this and i
don't want to risk it
the flat is on a second flood out of
four
that's going to be important though i
guess just in a way that it's not the
last floor
you're kind of the [ __ ] for thinking
that your cigarettes don't stink
and i don't mean that to be
super anti-smoking but i don't think
i've ever walked by somebody smoking a
cigarette
and been like wow that's good what is
that lemon pound cake
for two months everything was good and
dandy but yesterday i've had my first
encounter with our upstairs neighbor
i went for a smoke after coming home
from work around 2am and as i'm standing
on my balcony
enjoying my last siggy of the day i hear
someone going
good evening can you not smoke on your
balcony i look above me a little bit
confused and see someone sticking his
head out of a window
it is so british good evening
in canada we would it would be hey bud
can you not
and in america i think you would already
at this point have weapons drawn
evening and why should i not do it
the neighbor then started a rant about
how the smoke goes
up and into his apartment woke him up
how he's been patient for a while but
now can't take it anymore how he has a
right to a healthy life and doesn't want
my filthy habits to impact it and so on
so a rant about how hot gases rise
he then suggests i should smoke in a
kitchen or go completely outside because
he doesn't like the smell
so you're saying i can't smoke in my
apartment on the balcony because you
don't like it
you mentioned you have a right to a
healthy life don't i have a right to do
with mine whatever i want i didn't come
to your home and start smoking after all
can't you just close your window and
move on to what she replied but it's hot
outside
i don't want to close my window now at
this point i'm not confused anymore
oh [ __ ]
just startled from his sheer audacity
so let me get this straight you don't
like me smoking here at my place but you
don't want to inconvenience yourself by
closing the window instead you want
me to do something differently even
though it's you who has
a problem with how things are that about
right let me get this straight
i'm playing music at 200 decibels
you're choosing not to sleep with ear
plugs in and it's somehow my
behavior that's causing the problem here
i don't think so
that seems a little do i not have the
right to do with my life whatever i
choose
instead you want me to do something
differently even though it's you who has
a problem with how things are
that about right yes well okay then
i replied and lighted another roll
up la da
it's the [ __ ] double g snoop
dogg
[Laughter]
i ignored his threats to pour cold water
on me whenever i'm smoking
since by the time i finished he was
still going on about pouring water
i simply said yeah you'd do that and
headed inside
so the question is am i the [ __ ]
or is he just an entitled jerk after all
look
tldr
i appreciate that there's a tldr this is
a good one man because it is
this is a spicy one
my thought
is heavily influenced by the fact here
that i'm not a smoker i'm sure
smokers are not going to enjoy this
personally someone who's lived in
apartment buildings shared living
situations
i would prefer
if a smoker would go outside
if they would go you know aware from the
air away from the air
intake valve or uh air intake greats
yo healthy gamer thanks for the raid
we're looking at people's uh
mental health on reddit and judging it
from a position of ignorance
and we're talking about cigarette
smoking right now so it's it's right on
brand
i'm sure anyway so for people that are
just joining the
it's an am i the [ __ ] thread and the
thread
is uh who's the [ __ ] someone who
smokes on their balcony
or the neighbor above them who gets
annoyed by the smoke coming into their
apartment
personally
don't i'm being forced to take a stand
for the first time ever
usually i'm just like i'm just on the
right side of history
um i'm on the side of the of the
upstairs neighbor
quite frankly i think generally speaking
you know
smoking uh in a situation where the
smoke goes through somebody's open
window
is uh not nice
stinks up the place secondhand smoke is
dangerous
uh i'm not even approaching it from the
situation of like the same
you know like oh so i don't have a right
to smoke but you have a right to keep
your window open
it's not really like that it's like you
know you're on the second floor can't
you just go outside
and and you know like smoke it in the
courtyard or something like that
that's that's my that's my two cents on
it
or like live on the fourth floor close
the window for two minutes
hey hey bang bang bang is two in the
morning bang bang bang can you close
your window
real quick i just need to smoke a
cigarette on my balcony
then you can open it up after that like
that's just
i don't understand how you couldn't like
especially if you just got home from
work why not just
smoke it outside and then go inside and
go to bed
plus this guy was talking about he seems
a little deluded to me
to begin with which is that he's like
you know i should uh
i can just smoke it in my room to begin
with because my cigarettes don't smoke
regardless
so i i kind of feel like he's not the
best judge of whether or not
his habit is inconveniencing other
people like i
i look at it kind of similarly to like
loud music you know what i mean i did i
forgot about the fact that it's
scentless uh mcbaron's tobacco
it's uh it's mcbaron's choice if
anyone's interested
one of the most smelly smokeless
tobaccos out there
but i look at it kind of like like loud
music you know it's 2 a.m
you're causing a disturbance with
something that you want to do
are there things that your neighbors
could do to maybe mitigate the nuisance
that it applies to them
yeah but at the same time is is it your
neighbor's responsibility to make sure
that you're not being a nuisance i don't
think so
but i think that there's going to be a
lot of people with disagreeing opinions
here
but i will also say in at least in
vancouver
this is already like codified into the
bylaws
like we don't uh most buildings at least
as far as i know are supposed to be
smoke free to begin with so when people
smoke on their balcony they legitimately
get like a 200
fine from the from the building uh
like strata corporation not from the
police
so you if you want to smoke like they
want you to smoke outside here
so this is already i'm of course i'm
like a little biased because this is
already what it's like here
it's rare to begin with for sure
plus the other thing is and and i'm not
suggesting this is what this person is
doing
um but you know when you're like under
people the smoke
you don't get the smoke smell and the
rising of it and stuff like that
um but you know you get like ash blowing
off their balcony and stuff like that
cigarette butts that fall from their
balcony up to
or down to your balcony like
you know that that's not because they're
smoking it's because they're like you
know
flicking their butts off the balcony and
stuff like that but still
anyway that's that's my thoughts
you get a little bit of the smoke i
suppose again that's why i like it it's
controversial
by the way oh i didn't look at the votes
you're the [ __ ] 46 not the [ __ ] 41
everybody sucks here 5
no [ __ ] here 2 i will also kind of
say
it it depends on how you look at this
okay
i kind of feel like everybody sucks here
i don't think so
i don't really feel like the neighbor
well i mean i guess the neighbor does
suck for suggesting he's
to pour cold water on you
that's kind of a that's kind of a dick
move but i don't feel like the neighbor
sucks for saying good evening could you
not smoke on your balcony it seems like
a
reasonable request you could say yes or
no to but then
no [ __ ] i'm like i don't know i kind
of feel like o.p
is an [ __ ] can i tell you why and
it's not fair
the fact that he keeps referring to his
cigarettes as roll-ups
me everything i need to know
it's the i i don't know it's like the
the super super libertarian argument of
like am i not allowed to do anything
that i ever want
and i'm like no of course not i mean i
guess like you could literally do
whatever you want but like
you know if you drink 12 beers and then
drive your car you might go to prison or
like die you know you of course you can
do
just about anything but you're not free
from the consequences of those actions
afterwards
what's next a license to make toast to
my own damn toaster
it's just it's just that's it's not the
argument that i would use
the if i were the smoker the argument i
would use
is
hold on i'm trying to think about it is
the balcony not
an outdoor space i think i would try to
get into more of a discussion about the
the zoning does a balcony count as
you know private property inside or does
it count as an outdoor space
i don't know especially if you got
concrete above you i i would get into
the semantics so if i'm not a lawyer
on reddit or in real life for that
matter but i feel like at the same time
you know you could uh you could make a
discussion there
versus uh is man not entitled to the
sweat of his brow
but i do also feel like your your
problem here could be
solved by walking down one flight of
stairs and then walking like
20 feet away from your building so it's
just my two cents i suppose
maybe that's a forehead moment but
ftl man okay
am i the [ __ ] for honking at a
pedestrian playing pokemon
go in a crosswalk
it's got to be a no i feel like you well
okay but i'm just going to hit you with
the cliff notes
there's a person crossing the road in
the middle of the street trying to catch
a pokemon
i blew my horn the guy turned and yelled
he's got five more seconds till the
light changes i yelled at him to stop
playing in the street
my mom told me i'm the [ __ ] because
he his light hadn't changed yet
um stopping in the middle of a crosswalk
to catch a pokemon kinda
i'm gonna kinda i'm gonna give you a
turbo answer that you're not the [ __ ]
there
i mean you're the driver is not the
[ __ ] but we already know how i feel
about jaywalkers obviously
was the person a kid i don't think so
they i mean
it's pokemon go that's only played by 35
year olds
i'm going top this month i need to find
some
some better answers am i the [ __ ] for
not insist rephrase oh my god it's so
long this is the longest post i've ever
seen
am i the [ __ ] for insisting that my
brother and his girlfriend not wear
gross clothes
in my car i 28 female
have a very sensitive nose
i can't do perfume i tell guys not to
wear cologne on a date i can't be around
cigarette or pot smoke or i start
gagging
another reason perhaps that the guy from
the last post was maybe a little bit of
a a yta
my whole family knows this and for the
most part are very supportive this
weekend my brother called me up at 2am
always at 2am right because he and his
girlfriend had missed the last train out
of the city because they met up with
some people at a bar and wound up going
back to their place for a bit he asked
me to come get him
my apartment is 40 minutes outside the
city and our parents who he lives with
are about an hour away
already he's the [ __ ]
it were you asleep at this point because
i i feel like if you don't plan for a
way to get home and you have to rely on
somebody
like calling your sister at 2 a.m that's
a big ask
i think you got to get an uber i told
them to get an uber
because if they reeked of alcohol
cigarettes and weed i didn't want them
into my car he said it would be too
expensive promised they didn't smell
and begged me to come am i
i mean like this feels so much like the
last one
they're like i've been doing stinky
things all night do you stink no
obviously not come on you can't smell
anything you're
you were at the bar at last call it's a
wasteland in there
i told him as long as they don't smell
i'd come get him but that i was prepared
to leave him if he did okay i can see
where this is going
i get to the address about an hour later
they came out it was clear they were
both drunk
my brother went to hug me and i could
immediately smell weed on him i started
wretching told him it wasn't going to
work and to call an uber
we showered there's no way you're
smelling anything
it's all in your head he said to me
apparently their solution was to shower
in these people's apartments thinking it
would get rid of the tobacco and a weed
smell on their clothes
i told them to call an uber and got back
in my car he banged on the window i told
him he wasn't getting in my car like
that i told him i'd give him half the
money for an
uber and i was leaving oh no
he told me to just roll the windows down
i told him i don't want it in my car
he said i showered these are the only
clothes i have i can't ride home naked
that gave me an idea i opened my trunk
grabbed two hold on
grabbed two blankets and two trash bags
i told them to put their clothes in the
bags and cover up with the blankets
his girlfriend handed it back and said
[ __ ] that i'll walk and
walked away this is
these are real human beings that live on
planet earth
do you ever just read these posts and go
like
my life is so simple like i'm deriving
so much contentment right now just from
realizing i have never
put myself into this situation
it's just it's it's so complicated just
to get home
couldn't you just sleep at your friend's
place and then at like you know eight in
the morning take public transit back
instead of getting naked and driving
home in a garbage bag
my brother told me i was out of my mind
it was all in my head i reached into my
wallet pulled out fifty dollars and said
to call uber he handed it back told me
to hold up and ran after his girlfriend
they came back and asked if they could
sit in the back with the windows open i
told him i wouldn't be able to stand it
for an hour so they begrudgingly
stripped
put their clothes in the bags and i tied
them off and threw them in the trunk
i drove them to our parents house in
silence and dropped them off without a
thank you
my brother's girlfriend unfriended me on
facebook he and she are not speaking and
my mom is furious saying i embarrassed
them
and i was being overly sensitive she
says i should have called her so she
could have gotten them my mom goes to
bed at nine so i don't think she would
have been thrilled i feel bad that i put
the condition on it
but i would not have been able to
tolerate being in my car otherwise
okay we need to look at the edits first
my reaction to smell is very extreme i
wretch i gag i throw up my eyes water my
stomach turns i get migraines my heart
races
i believe you if if this whole post is
real i believe this part too
i think you know what it is i think it's
like it's debate class
you have to acknowledge like shared
truths as the foundation for the
argument okay
i'm taking op at face value that
if they smell cologne they gag
now if i was in public
and someone started gagging because they
smelled my speed stick or something like
that
would i go like okay
you may be i'm sorry i'm the [ __ ] for
wearing some deodorant
um yeah but in this situation i don't
disagree with it for sure
i mean i don't disbelieve it i guess i
should say
everyone who's voting that i'm the
[ __ ] seems to think i forced this
girl to take off her clothes
there is no part of me that enjoyed
asking my brother to give up his clothes
to get in my car
i had no smile on my face and i
apologize to them for being so sensitive
to smell
i pushed for the uber i even offered to
cover most of it
they didn't want to get it an uber when
they were in that condition i was
embarrassed to ask them to strip but
there was not a way for me to make it an
hour with them in the car in those
clothes
i did not tell them to get naked i told
them to put their clothes in a bag
there's a difference i didn't say get
naked
i said put your clothes in the trash bag
if you could put your stinky clothes in
the trash bag without taking them off
by all means otherwise i don't see like
i'm the [ __ ] here
they went behind the car i had my back
to them and was keeping my distance my
brother handed me the bags and i tied
them up and threw them in the trunk
without inspecting them
at first i thought she inspected them
and i was like she's the [ __ ] now
that i know she
didn't inspect them i'm inclined to
think that maybe she was in the right
the blankets were a good size so all you
could really see is they were both
barefoot and had removed their shirts
and pants i do not know if they left
their underwear on or were naked under
there
any intimate bits were covered is we
don't need to go into all that kind of
stuff
um knowing all the context
i would be inclined to agree with the
flare i think
and say that everybody sucks here but
can i can i
offer something here
the sister who is the op her
absurd behavior
in this whole situation is predicated
upon being called at 2 am
roused from sleep potentially at least
called outside of the normal hours that
we would consider
the quorum acceptable to call someone at
asked for them to drive 40 minutes out
of their way and then an hour to their
parents house because
the brother and his girlfriend didn't
adhere to a plan
to handle their own transportation
that immediately puts them on the moral
high ground
from my situation
is op a little
uh out of line
[Laughter]
yeah um my two cents
is that she should have just said um
here's not she shouldn't have even given
them the money to be honest
in my opinion um but she should have
just said
i'm not gonna do it take an uber if if
she's so
sensitive to any kind of smell like this
that she would throw up if she was
interacting with them for more than an
hour
so i i think she this doesn't make her
the [ __ ]
but i don't think she should have even
enabled them by going
out to their apartment in the first
place i think she should have just been
like
i'm not coming either call mom or take
an uber
and i'll tell you as well your brother
is going to learn
a very serious lesson if he calls you
you're his sister and you say no
wake up our mom at 2 a.m to come pick
you up while you're stinky
that's probably the last time that the
brother is going to do that
i think that next time he'll make sure
he he takes the bus home because that's
going to be an embarrassing
and shameful drive
that being said i
this this post should be called am i the
weirdo i mean that's kind of where i'm
at
is like when she's like
i made them well not made them i told
them if they want to drive home with me
you can take off your clothes
put them in a garbage bag and wrap
yourself up in some blankets
i'm like well you're within your right
to do it if that's what's required
uh to get home without having you throw
up
but at the same time you should never
ask anybody to ever do that
the suggestion that uh
you had to to have them strip off their
clothes and then drive home naked with
blankets on
is it does it's not criminal i think but
it's very bizarre
no wonder by the way like the brother
is probably like this is nothing i
haven't seen before i grew up with this
but the brother's girlfriend i mean i
would be furious
i think i also might be like
chad can we just take an uber you know
like like this is crazy
um but can i also tell you that i think
i would have a great sense of humor
about it
in in my 20s at least i think i would
have a sense of humor about it
hello okay
enjoy your walk
like i think if my friend's sister came
and picked us up and she was like you
have to be
you have to take off your clothes and
strip down into this blanket i would be
like whoa
comfy ride comfy ride home
plus ubers did not exist when i was in
this phase of my life
and the taxi probably would have been
like 300 bucks so
op made an update okay how how does one
find an update i'm 100 years old
is there an easy way to do that
click okay i'll just click on their
username i just don't want to see their
other posts because i'm sure they're all
on
our slash rick and morty um
okay give me a second update this is
from 21 days ago
oh my god it's so freaking
long dude okay okay okay
update day of course it is
i bet before i read it i feel like all
the updates are like
i got out of my head and we started
talking about it and we're friends again
like every update post it's never like
and then she went to prison
it's always like we had a conversation
and
you know worked it out so my brother's
girlfriend texted me that she wanted to
meet up
and drop the blanket off when i dropped
them off i grabbed the bags out of my
truck and handed them to them i did not
ask for the blankets back
as i did not she's so paranoid about
like i didn't see my brother's
you know what i did not see my brothers
you know what
a lot of people are suggesting i did
this just to catch a glance at my
brothers you know what
i did not she came over to my apartment
i joked if she had the undress to come
inside
and handed me back my blanket she said
it was very soft and comfortable and
apologize for not giving it back that
night
she actually washed it in unscented
detergent
wow hey she thanked me for coming to get
them the other night apologize for
freaking out and explained a few things
my brother had told her the trains ran
all night he wanted to stay with these
friends of his and couldn't she couldn't
stand the smell in there
it's it's a common theme
it is stinky everywhere she had called
several friends none of whom were
willing to come and get her at 2am he
claimed our mother didn't keep her phone
on which is why he called me
he kept insisting i'd never let them in
her car and they should just stay there
i think he called me just so i would
refuse and they could stay there she's
the one that suggested
they shower so it wouldn't be as bad for
me okay
since my brother lives with our parents
she thinks he wanted some alone time
with her since they never get to spend
overnights together
she didn't even realize that i suggested
they strip when i handed her the blanket
in the bag
i didn't hear my brother say let's just
stay here she thought i was giving her a
blanket to sleep and that's when she
stormed off
when she was walking away she took all
of us off facebook
because she was done with my brother she
added me back
when he caught up hold on when he caught
up he suggested again they just stayed
there he told her that i told her
he told her that i told her the only way
they could ride was if they stripped off
their clothes and went home in blankets
she told them i feel gross i want my bed
i don't even care at this point let's
just go
when they came back he suggested the
windows rolled down why is it it's
it's so like it's like reading an
encyclopedia
when i refused she started undressing so
he went along with it
as for why they didn't call an uber he
didn't want to
and she didn't want to ride in one alone
drunk for an hour miraculously she's not
done with my brother she's pissed at him
for lying to her and stranding her
without a ride back but she's going over
there to talk she loves that butt head
as she put it
she's made me a lot more focused she's
made him a lot more focused and she's
been good for him so i'm happy they're
sticking with
each other for now i feel a lot better
after talking i really did think that
they might be dating at the end of this
when when they said that she had um
she washed in scentless detergent i was
like this is
i don't believe this anymore we'll do a
few more before we pivot here
i believe this again i think it's one of
those things that's like
if you wanted to lie on reddit i don't
think you would lie to be like guess
what check this out
i can't smell anything or i throw up
that's
that's how busted my olfactory system is
just though is a weird anti-flex
anyway it seems like it all got to got
sorted out in the end
am i the [ __ ] for wearing compression
shorts to the gym
[Laughter]
i gotta know i don't even understand
am i the [ __ ] for wearing compression
shorts to the gym
i recently moved to a new city and
joined a local gym i always worked out
of my apartment gym but before this
but before but this new apartment does
not have one so i joined a local chain
gym
when i work out i usually wear
compression shorts and a t-shirt mostly
because i find the most comfortable for
the types of exercises that i do
so the way i understand it compression
shorts are
uh like very
tight like lycra
almost they you you wear the yeah it's
like under armour
spandex like you wear them
uh for the same reason that you wear
like a compression sock or something
like that i i think it's for uh
like increased blood flow or something
but usually you wear them as like an
under
layer not as
not as your outerwear but anyway
just to give you some context if you're
not sure what a compression short is
um however a couple weeks after joining
i had a woman come up to me and tell me
i needed to put pants on
this wasn't a gym staff just another
member i asked her if there was any rule
or dress code that specified that she
said she didn't know but i was exposing
myself which is inappropriate
and then i can already hear it like so i
took that personally
for the record my compression shorts are
not translucent or any
oh really your compression shorts are
not translucent
that's good that you're you're not
buying uh
translucent clothing to wear to the gym
they're a gray heather or black fabric
hold on okay
so just so many every word changes the
dynamic here
um i pictured them as being
black and i was like
you know they're i'm sure they're short
i'm sure they're
tight but at least they're dark when
now he's saying they're gray heather and
i'm like
that's maybe i'm a prude
that's a little bit more obscene that is
an
gray heather is an underwear color
especially in
in compression shorts parlets
[Laughter]
at least with like black compression
shorts i could be like maybe they're
just
short but anyway what she is referring
to though is the bulge
which obviously is visible when wearing
compression shorts
i told her i don't believe there's any
issue with my shorts and put my
headphones back in
a couple of weeks later i had a
different woman come up to what what are
the odds
two people with the exact wrong opinion
wow crazy man
uh i had a different woman come up and
do something similar she said are you
gonna put pants on dude to which i told
her i was wearing shorts
the gym itself hasn't talked to me about
this as far as i'm aware it's not that
unusual to wear compression shorts
nor do i see how they're different from
leggings which are very common
i can understand how the visible bulge
may make some people uncomfortable but
how hard is it to just not look at it
wow you're definitely the [ __ ]
and i'm gonna say something else okay my
hunch
is that your dick is not as big as you
think it is
i think you're wearing tight compression
shorts i think this guy's getting a
little thrill
i think when pete when women come up to
him he's like
in his head he's like oh another woman
threatened by my unbelievably huge bulge
i think that he is trying to i think
he's getting the rise out of this based
on the way that he wrote this
i think he's a little freak hold on we
gotta we gotta load up the comments for
this
give me a second here i'm i'm looking at
the shorts
one moment please
i have to be honest these are longer
than i thought they were i know this
green region's a little screwed up
they're longer than i thought they were
but they
are much tighter than i thought they
were
like they it seems like they go to maybe
just the top of the knee
but uh they they seem very tight
what is this
why is he why is he vibrating what
happened to his hand
what's going on man he's moving so fast
he couldn't catch it um
can i be honest this this changes my
opinion somewhat i still think op's kind
of a weirdo
but that doesn't seem that bad i in my
head i was picturing
shorter like i was picturing like
not briefs but like boxer briefs oh
click play it's a video i see
and i'm sure the gray is is worse
the way that he's reacted to the
comments like here's
here's my thinking okay it's one of
those things where you're like if one
person comes up to you
and it's like your outfit's
inappropriate for the gym i think you
could be like
you know take one of these and call me
in the morning and give him a middle
finger emoji
if two people come up to you in like a
week and they're like hey your outfit's
making us uncomfortable
i think you should i think you should
you know maybe consider wearing pants to
the gym instead
that's my thoughts on that or you know
i mean it depends i mean the other thing
is you could just
keep working out of the gym and deal
with the fact that you know once every
two weeks someone's gonna come
up to you and be like hey you're wearing
your underwear in the gym but
all it takes is a loose pair of athletic
shorts on top that's what i'm saying
what if we did that with women i mean
you can't just use that as an argument
it's like
yeah i mean there are double standards
is you know
a situation where you gotta look at uh
society right like this though the whole
segment that we're doing here is like a
deconstruction of proper behavior in
public
you know you're if you get to the point
where you're like well what if
a woman was wearing compression shorts
well like you you examine that through
the lens
i can't do it without having contacts i
feel like if
if a woman uh got asked by two guys
to like hey could you maybe not wear
compression
shorts to the gym and instead wear
something a little bit less revealing
it does carry the context of like maybe
these guys are creeps
but i think it also carries the context
of like if she made the post that was
like why can't these guys stop looking
at my like
you know my incredible assets then i
would be like she's a weirdo too
[Laughter]
if she had made the if she had the same
kind of energy that this guy had
where she was like i can't help it if my
awesome
package is getting this much attention
you know i would be like okay she's also
trying to
she's getting the same kind of thrills
that the guy's getting
this reminds me actually kate and i were
going for a walk yesterday we saw
uh probably like a 70 year old man
and uh he had like an old timey pair of
binoculars
we were like what is this guy doing like
bird watching or something like that
he was not bird watching
he was looking at uh joggers
and sunbathers and uh
etc etc and just
not touching himself but just
just looking which is also weird um
obviously
but you know it and you gotta be careful
with what you're saying
um in a way it was almost like
weirder because if he was
engaging in an act of self-love i think
i would be like
he's just you know out of his mind
but him just kind of like
passively taking it all in i was like is
he like
is he storing this data for later or
like what's going on
he's just very anyway sorry he's the
[ __ ] in this situation
that being said i will say having you
know gone to the gym many times
look i it it really so much of these
posts is really just like
are you willing to change
literally anything about your behavior
in order to
smooth over a situation even if you
think you're in the right
you know what i mean like when i'm at a
home i'll work out in my underwear
i don't care you know if i go to the gym
is it comfortable
or is it uh unacceptable to work out in
like boxer briefs
probably is it also you know could could
you put on shorts that are shorter than
boxer briefs and they would consider it
to be
probably fine you would be like yeah i
suppose but
you know you gotta i don't know i feel
like
if you're gonna wear really tight
compression shorts to the gym
you might have to deal with people on
occasion being like hey you know
i can see your i can see your bulge
i guess and you could either put shorts
on over top of that or
alternatively you could be like thank
you so much that's where i'm at i don't
know if he's an [ __ ] i do think the
way that he wrote it was a little
strange
am i the [ __ ] for giving my friend
the wrong answers in an examination
resulting in her failing
throw away because my main has lots of
personal info and even though i don't
care if my friend sees this i don't want
some person
who thinks i'm the [ __ ] which i may
be to okay yes
understood my friend lucy and i have
known each other since middle school
from a young age
lucy has developed a habit of asking me
for answers to test papers or
assignments and i always gave them to
her but also made her understand the
questions and answers
yikes keep in mind 17 and 18 these are
these are kids
you know it's off to a bad start but
they are just kids
junior year i told lucy i would no
longer help her cheat since our grades
had an actual impact
and consequence and she always managed
to convince me to help her especially
since we've been friends for so long
this is one of the reason why i may be
the [ __ ] by the way since i helped
her develop this habit of depending on
me
okay well like
i i don't know what to say about that
one i feel like it's one of those things
where
obviously you're not the [ __ ] for
helping someone develop a habit
of them being an [ __ ] however i
am like simultaneously i think that
she knows that this doesn't make her an
[ __ ] and is putting it out there as a
little
pity breadcrumb like hansel and gretel
style
i think she's like i might be an [ __ ]
for making them treat me like
crap you know anyway that's just my
cynicism coming up
um she would always leave a few
questions and this basically ensured the
teacher wouldn't find out she was
cheating because at the end of the
examination remarks would be different
so the teacher wouldn't have any reason
to doubt us
i get a's and she writes enough to get
b's this is our last year in school and
at the start of the semester i told her
that this time i would definitely not
help her for real this time source dude
just trust me
i told her that enough was enough and
then if she got into a good college with
the mark she got by cheating
that would not be fair to someone who
worked hard she said she understood and
that was that in the first two major
examinations she got
seized and i guess her parents were not
happy lucy then begged me to help her
again and would constantly badger me
every day by spamming my
socials or when we meet up with friends
i told her i no longer wanted to talk to
her but she would just not let things go
and even threatened to reveal some
secrets i had trusted her with when we
were younger
oh my god
that's pretty bad she's actually like uh
she's like jim carrey from the cable guy
so two weeks ago when we had an
examination she asked me for answers i
gave her the wrong ones
she left some and somehow got marks for
that but her overall grade was
f we got the results yesterday until
that moment i was just
i thought i was justified in doing what
i did to get her to stop harassing me
but when she got the results she started
sobbing
like full-on crying and i felt so guilty
she later called me a lot of names and
told me i crushed her dreams and i feet
so bad
but i know i did what i did so that she
would stop with the cheating so
i'm confused am i the [ __ ]
very very classic situation
where your friend
is definitely the [ __ ] no question
about that
there's not even anything to discuss
because she's just i mean literally just
cheating
on all of her tests and then on top of
that
uh also threatening to blackmail you if
you don't help her
are you the [ __ ]
i would not because she cried and not
because she got an f
you you're an [ __ ] and if we if we
define the situation as having one
[ __ ]
you're not the [ __ ] your friend is
the [ __ ]
you could have refused you could have
been like go ahead
tell everybody i wet my pants until i
was in the eighth grade
but can i tell you i'm kind of like you
know what
i think she's not the [ __ ] i know
that
so this has been voted as as everyone
sucks here um
i'm inclined to say at the very least
she's not an [ __ ]
for uh giving her the wrong answers
i think that's a little based i'd be i'd
say yb you're based however
i do think you're kind of the [ __ ]
for
helping her cheat on
tests for like literally what seems like
you know five or six years
so he's a little bit of not the [ __ ]
a little bit you're the [ __ ] and a
little bit of your base
that's my uh that's my assumption on
this one
definitely though even if you're in a
wrong you're not in the
wrong this is uh your your friend is uh
your friend is definitely the most in
the wrong
but i mean this is like the smoking one
i know i know they did uh
people don't believe me i'm not trying
to flex
i never cheated on a test
middle school high school college
you just fill it out and if you lose
then
if you get a bad mark then you get a bad
mark
if anything i always feel like it's kind
of hard like how do you i don't even
know how you cheat on a test in like
high school
like is it like
maybe like i i have to be honest i don't
think my eyes
are good enough for me to look
over at my friend's desk see their paper
and see what answers they put down i
don't think i could do it
i don't think i have the glance
technology built in on an ocular level
and if you go i think you would get
caught right like i don't know
different periods of the same class
i get that makes sense but if you're in
different periods of the same class
isn't that just studying
[Laughter]
isn't it just if your friend had the
test
at nine in the morning and you've got it
at noon and then you're like hey teach
me the stuff
like isn't that just i mean you're
studying the answers admittedly but at
least you're learning
at least you're not just copying
verbatim
not quite i don't know man i'm like
you're what's the point
what's the point of school if not to if
not to learn some answers
is it supposed to be a test about
you know studying exactly the right
material or is it supposed to be do you
know this thing
based on one person said bass so i'm
moving on
oh and we're moving on in general okay
that's the end of the uh
the am i the [ __ ] chord this week but
i had a great time
definitely think am i the [ __ ]
filtered is a is a good



ah that's better being able to see
the actual layout having enough white
space
i actually feel like i we were on old
reddit for a second there now i feel
like i'm uh
i'm in a much better position like i
just feel safer
i feel like i have space around me like
that white space on the side i i quite
enjoy
let's look at the top posts um from the
last
we were talking about it a second ago
like the reddit is not exactly the
fastest uh working website on the planet
here
uh we'll look at the top post from this
week on uh
am i the [ __ ] filtered top
top post hi reddit i'm wes and i lead
our sustainability efforts at accenture
okay wes um you're not an [ __ ] but at
the same time i do kind of wish you
weren't at the like very top of the
um board here but that's okay how about
this one
i like this would i be the [ __ ] am i
the [ __ ] for
siding with my mom over my wife and
humiliating my wife
in front of my family um
we're about to find out i can see the
flare but i choose not to okay
we had a family dinner tonight and it
did not end well this is always a great
start hey fishy head
thanks for the gifted subscriptions my
wife doesn't get along with my family
i do not allow any blatant disrespect
but i know they don't like her i had to
cut off my younger sister because of how
disrespectful she was
but we are still in contact with my
mom's stepdad and middle sister
you know this doesn't seem that crazy so
far i mean it's family's family it
happens
my wife thinks that my mom is a picky
eater i don't think that's fair growing
up i was exposed to a huge variety we
ate stuff from different cultures we ate
vegetables
my mom loves spicy food
i i like it's usually in the second
paragraph
you just end up getting uh like
something that makes the other person
like it it finally reveals the
personality
flaw that is going to lead to the rest
of the post and i love it
she just doesn't like the type of food
my wife grew up with which usually
involves barbecue sauce or
thick gravy
to be clear my mom will eat the foods
without the sauces but my wife won't
accommodate her and says it isn't her
job to cuddle my mom
i kind of get where she's coming from
because my mom is used to getting what
she wants and can be
ridiculously stubborn
always a barbecue sauce or a thick gravy
last time they came over like four
months ago my mom refused to eat she
said my wife could have separated the
piece of chicken before putting the
barbecue sauce on and she was just being
a [ __ ]
okay that's a little much i would say
personally uh
but maybe there's some foundational
aggression that's happened here in the
past
it's a easy everybody sucks here can i
also say without being too judgmental
to begin with it's just barbecue sauce
you know i don't mean this suggests like
you can't have food preferences
i think it would be a little bit of a
different story right now if she was
putting
i mean it's just it's it's delicious
tang and sweetness
you know the idea that you would
separate the breasts if she asked for it
i guess is fine but i'm just surprised
that's all i'm saying
um i did yell at my mom for the language
but i'm sick of this
for tonight i asked my wife to make
anything not
involving barbecue or gravy and she
refused so i went out and got my mom's
salmon and vegetables from a local
restaurant
when my wife saw it she called me a
piece of [ __ ]
she told my mom if she wanted to eat it
she had to go outside
and then when she got mad because my mom
went in the pool
she ate on a float we don't have chairs
out there are you telling me
so let's just
tell me your family is dysfunctional
without telling me your family's
dysfunctional
uh asked my wife to cook something that
doesn't involve barbecue sauce or gravy
she said impossible literally can't be
done that you've just eliminated 99
of the foods uh that exist on the planet
okay
uh your mother-in-law comes over and she
says couldn't you have just given me a
plain chicken breast
[ __ ] a little bit over the top on top
of that to begin with
then he said hey the guy said hey mom
op says hey mom don't call my wife a
[ __ ] that's a little rude
but i will go out and get you salmon and
vegetables from a local restaurant
wife calls you a piece of [ __ ] and then
says
if you want which is so abnormal if you
want to eat the food you have to eat it
outside
which is i just can't imagine having a
demand like that to begin with i guess
she's just offended
um and then your mom
gets on a floaty and eats the salmon and
vegetables in the pool
that's unbelievable it's it's so many
bizarre behavioral choices in such a
small space of time
i just imagine that like the mom eating
the salmon in the
in an above ground pool on like a
floating chair and the wife seething
like looking through the blinds like
my dad ended up cussing at us both so i
had to ask
him to leave it never it never gets
better
my when we went out to get my mom my
wife tried to splash her and make the
float tip
my mom got away and my wife ended up in
tears
needless to say we will not do dinner at
our house again but i feel like such an
ass i think i was technically in the
clear but my wife cried and that hurts
me deep
ed why are so many people asking why i
don't cook i'm not opposed to it but i'm
not allowed to cook
that is something my wife asks of her
partners and it makes her feel secure
what the hell are you talking about
[Laughter]
this this feels a little bit like
everybody's fake here
um
so you the husband cannot cook
because the wife forbids it let's assume
it's real okay but
um that's insane also
i i do doubt
can i just say that i doubt that the
number one question he got is why don't
you cook
i am guessing the number one question
that he got is why doesn't your wife
just cook something without barbecue
sauce or
and or gravy because that really
eliminates
like less than i think 30 foods
that are commonly cooked in a home
kitchen and and really could have uh
made anything else including salmon and
vegetables
uh so who's the [ __ ] if we're
assuming this story is real
it's um okay
everybody sucks here is my that's my
verdict right now
but can i tell you i kind of don't think
the husband
uh sucks mom sucks
she called son's wife a [ __ ] there's
basically no situation that makes that
uh acceptable there's probably a couple
like if she hit you with her car or
something like that while she was
looking at her phone
um but simultaneously like that's over
the line
especially just because she made a food
that you don't like okay even if you
asked for her not to do it you'd just be
like
oh you just swallow your pride on that
one and then never go back i think
um the wife is uh a total [ __ ]
and uh insane as well
i don't even know what to say
so so much of this is bizarre to me um
in particular not allowing
your mother-in-law to eat food that she
brought in your house
and then also trying to tip over her
floaty in the pool
i will say that although i said the mom
sucks the fact that
she chose not to just eat outside like
on the grass and instead she ate in the
pool
is actually kind of sick that that
almost redeems her
however the husband being
not an [ __ ] here almost it to me i
feel like if i was in the court of
public opinion
i would want more information cause i
don't believe
that your mom is an [ __ ] and your
wife is an [ __ ]
and you're just like an impartial third
party
i believe that if we ask them for their
opinion on the story we might get a
little bit more context to the husband's
behavior
because i i i doubt that it's like an
[ __ ] stew with like a little not
[ __ ] you know piece of cornbread on
top i bet that there's something else
going on here
um but i would say for me
on this one this this has got to be in
everybody sucks here
with a little kicker wife is worse i
mean come on
you tried to tip over your mother-in-law
i don't even
there there's been uh times where like
my mother-in-law
you know she like drove kate and me to
uh like an event and when when she
drives she like slams on the gas
when the light turns green and then when
the car in front of her hits their brake
lights she slams on the brake
right and i get motion sick like crazy
and i'm just like
in the back of the car going like like
almost throwing up
you know what i say when we arrive i say
thanks for the ride
that's it you just uh you know you gotta
you gotta be polite
okay yeah yeah you're b everybody's
based here okay
would i be the [ __ ] if i took away my
son's gaming pc
you know i said most situations it
sounds like they're gonna be
the [ __ ] and then they're not
this one i'm like i guarantee i'm gonna
be like you're not the [ __ ]
i would expect there's almost no
situation where i'm gonna read this and
then be like
you're not in the clear let me get he's
posting on
he he's calling people slurs when he
plays apex legends he's going into
streamers chats and going like sorry egg
gotta leave
germa went live etc etc let's see i'm
just looking at this to get mad now
i just want to get mad
oh wow this is a short one my teenage
son has a gaming pc teenage son with a
gaming pc getting high on
information he plays four to five hours
per day this has caused his summer
school grades to suffer
and normal school grades to suffer he is
also not completing chores or being
self-disciplined
this weekend i finally snapped and took
away his pc but this entire week he's
been angry and annoyed at me saying i am
mean and unfair he's also saying i can't
take it away because he saved it with
his own money and he got
that he got from birthdays christmas and
selling on etsy
hold on
sigma grind is the rising grind rising
grand gamer
he's got an etsy store can we
i gotta go into the thread i got to see
more about this kids
etsy store i only want his grades to
improve and will give the pc back if his
grades go up am i the [ __ ]
this is a an actual tough one man
i thought it was going to be easy okay
yo matt x powers you're not the [ __ ]
for those gifted subs thank you
thank you what can i say one thing right
out of the gate
i think my parents must be glad
that they uh raised the child
when gaming pcs were not all the rage
like i my dad he took my xbox away once
or twice
when i was like 14 or 15 years old but
that's literally you just like
unplugged two things and just you know
forced it over your shoulder
a gaming pc that's a that's a pain in
the ass you got to unplug like 30 things
at the back of it
so let's talk about this a little bit
more
um the first thing i would say is it
sounds like the dad
has his son's best interest in mind okay
he wants his son to be good at school
i feel like there's a little subtext
that goes on here which is that if your
teenage son is in summer school
or mom sure yeah or mom uh
if your teenage son is in summer school
i believe that the only reason you end
up in summer school
unless you're getting ahead of classes
to make like your senior year that much
easier
is to you know for remedial purposes
get your marks up from the previous year
or semester or
or you know get some supplemental
information so
it seems like the grade thing is a
sticking point it's a real issue
and when you're a teenager like when
you're an adult if you want to screw up
your own life
nobody can stop you really you know uh
well except for you know the police i
guess but
you know when you're a teenager the
parent has a prerogative to be like
you know like in 10 years you're gonna
be like i i really threw away my
high school education and my maybe like
my ability to succeed in college because
i was too into gentian impact like
you're gonna end up
there there will be regrets there let me
just say however
i will say it's a prickly er subject
when he did buy the pc himself
i mean when he when he says he bought it
himself with the money that he got from
birthdays and christmas
i'm like i you know i'm playing kind of
a tiny violin for that one
it's like i worked hard being alive and
also
thanking santa claus for that money but
the etsy stuff
sure it seems like he he put in a little
bit of effort there to
to hustle for the etsy stuff but at the
same time
you know i think it's i i originally
thought i was gonna be like
maybe not you're the [ __ ] but you're
like a little [ __ ] here
i'm gonna go not the [ __ ] now that i
thought about it some more
and i think it's just you know the the
whole point of this is
i think a parent has a right to
circumvent some of their child's
autonomy for what they feel is in their
best interest
obviously if you take that to their to
the absurd
extreme of like you know you could just
lock him in the room forever then you're
gonna be the [ __ ] but
if you uh if you're doing something
within reason that can establish good
habits for them i think you have a uh
i think you have an impetus i'm going to
say not the [ __ ]
i will also say there's got to be some
kind of compromise
like what about a compromise where like
if he does his homework as soon as he
comes home from summer school
uh like summer school snack
homework gaming why not that that does
the same thing of establishing like a
good habit of making sure that you're
uh you know finishing the work that you
have to do and he's
trying he's making an effort if you i
think if you just take it away from
him you risk uh creating resentment but
at the same time i'm like you know
i'm not saying i'd be above it if it
came to that we'll see
it's one of those things i'm sure it's
like you know
i i'm very wary of this now that i have
a child you know
you're like well if i was a parent i
would simply come up with a rational
plan that we would all sign on the
dotted line and agree to
and there would be a laid out series of
terms if anybody breached the agreement
and as a result we would all agree that
this is fair and equitable and when
you're actually uh
you know you got your own life at middle
aged and then also your teenage son is
like giving you the middle finger i'm
sure you're like yeah we'll
guess who controls like literally
everything in this house
anyway more complicated than i thought
it would be
let's put it that way
am i the [ __ ] for getting mad at my
parents
for selling my video games for
practically nothing
i'm noticing a lot of uh a lot of gaming
based threads this week this is uh
this is a big positive for me this this
is my area of expertise
it it describes uh my my two
passions video games and also judging
other people unfairly
am i the [ __ ] for getting mad at my
parents for selling my video games for
practice
practically nothing i 19 male
live with my parents and we are in the
process of moving to a new house
my parents decided to host a yard sale
and since i wasn't available to help
they asked if i'd be willing to sell
some of my old video games
if they paid me back already
a couple of things here
one is i don't understand why we have an
ad for vip casino
this this scares me
because i consume no casino-based
content
but i do talk about my opinion on
gambling streamers
in our private discord you spying on me
a little [ __ ]
targeted marketing man
i did watch shib that's true still do it
should be ads for
10 million california uh penthouses then
anyway um
get 10 free spins to win a million
dollars
you could just do that you could just
lie
in the ad and by lie i mean you know
presented
reality that is probably like a one in
17 billion chance
but as if like uh it's 50 50 anyway um
moving on so 19 live with their parents
honestly already you might be expecting
like oh they should they contribute
financially to the household they should
pay rent
uh in in a perfect world maybe
but at the same time i'm like 19 is so
young
especially in an era where like young
people have been like
genetic not genetically economically
crushed
uh over and over by both covid and the
great financial crisis
and house prices that have risen
substantially faster than
wages um so i definitely feel like uh
this is a situation if if this goes in a
direction of like you're an adult now
you should have to pay us i'm like well
the parents are [ __ ] but anyway
the thing that is is strange for me is
selling
your kids video games
and then paying him back later
but i guess that maybe just speaks to
the economic reality of the situation
here
anyway i told him it was fine but i
handed them a list of video games i did
not want them to sell
and told them to look up how much the
games are worth before selling them i
didn't expect them to sell a lot
given that most of the games i own right
now cost a small fortune online
all right you i'm telling you
immediately you have
made a mistake if most of the games you
own cost
a small fortune and that insinuates
maybe you're a collector or something
you should not have given your parents
permission to sell
any of them they don't know
they got no idea
my mom is still of the she has like you
know probably 5 000 hockey cards from
the 90s
she still thinks they're gonna be worth
like a million dollars someday like it's
gonna be a nest egg you can retire off
of
you got to be nobody is aware of
everything in the collectibles market
you gotta
you know i think you should have been
there if if you're gonna
you know give them permission for this
oh no when i asked where my games were
i found that nearly all of my gamecube
ds 3ds games had been sold
including one i wrote down on my list
can i can i say something
they shouldn't have sold the one on the
list
but you can't be there you don't have
the justifiability to be upset
about the other ones if the other ones
were not on the list
some of the games cost hundreds of
dollars to buy so i knew my parents
didn't look up the prices like i said
when i called them out on it they said
if they if i wanted things done right
i should have been there and also
mentioned they paid for some of the
games themselves
i've never gotten into any serious
arguments with my parents before but i
told them that
until they gave me what i would have
gotten by selling the games online
which would be over two thousand dollars
i don't want to hear any more of your bs
my mom's acting like nothing happened
but my dad's refusing to talk to me
am i the [ __ ]
uh okay i like that the
the comment is uh under the threshold
so we actually can't see the judgment
i think i'm gonna i'm gonna end up i
guess it's everybody sucks here
i think i'm gonna end up making some
enemies in chat on this one look the dad
might be an [ __ ]
for uh not talking to you i don't know
what's going on with that but that's
like a
a one sentence statement um
so it's hard to glean much from that can
i say though like it sounds like he's
uh you know a video game enthusiast it
sounds like he's a collector
he um gave his parents permission to
sell anything that wasn't on the list
he did tell them to look up the values
in advance
i i think i don't want to say he's an
[ __ ]
i i kind of feel like he just made a
mistake
[Laughter]
if that makes sense i feel like what he
thought he was getting into
was a situation where uh
his he was like hey i can offload some
of these games at market value
because my parents just volunteered to
go look up
the price for all this stuff on ebay and
then sell it for what it's worth at our
garage sale
which by the way i don't know where you
live but i think if you start selling
like you know
a 200 copy of skies of arcadia or
something like that at your garage sale
you're not gonna get many biters i think
you're you're
that's a situation you probably want to
take that straight to ebay
instead of you know putting it behind
glass at your
on your front porch but anyway um
garage sale is not where you go for
market value you know that that's where
you
put out stuff that is priced to move and
gary vaynerchuk shows up and he buys
like some shitty mug from like the 1976
olympics and then he gets in his car and
goes like you see this
you see you and then he looks it up on
ebay and it's like 10 bucks and he's
like i got that for 250
400 gain anyway
um i think is unreasonable of
the video game collector to
assume that his parents were going to do
the necessary due diligence to sell
something at a yard sale
that's just my two i think even his
parents would have been like
okay in that case just keep him um
i also think he can't be mad if
only one of the games on the list was
sold he can be mad about the game on the
list that was sold
but i also don't think uh you know the
other ones he doesn't get to be like
they sold the one game on the list and
the other
30 games that i told them as well um
that i that i said implicitly was okay
so i don't know if he's an [ __ ] i
also feel
like his parents are definitely not
[ __ ]
at all like i don't
i don't see a situation where his
parents could be [ __ ] for anything
except his dad not talking to him right
now
but you know he's mad
i mean his parents did buy him the games
maybe but
he's probably you know like when he's
eight i don't think you can really do
that you could buy your kid like a
christmas gift and then 10 years later
be like oh i bought it for you anyway
but i'm filling in a lot of the blanks
with like a headcanon here
uh because it's only two paragraphs long
which is a brevity that i actually
appreciate to be honest
reread the last two lines i told them
until they gave me what i would have
gotten by selling the games online i
didn't want to hear any more of their bs
yeah i mean uh i don't know if if that's
emotion or or if he's genuinely got that
going on in his head
because i mean it is a situation where
uh you know as a parent i'm like by the
time you get your kid to the age of 19
you've probably invested like hundreds
of thousands of dollars into their
uh upbringing which admittedly like they
didn't ask for but
to to nickel and dime because they sold
your copy of suicide in three
is a little bit uh you know i i think
you don't need to go
into that level of minutiae if that
makes sense
uh i also don't know what it means when
they say i don't want to hear any more
of your bs
[Laughter]
it sounds like if your dad's refusing to
talk to you and your mom's acting like
nothing's happening
uh then it sounds like they're not
giving you bs and as a result you have
achieved what you wanted
anyway um
i will say 19 is young but it is maybe
a little old uh to be getting into this
kind of
contentious discourse with your parents
but
i don't know this is it's this strikes
me as just something that's just
it it's just an unfortunate situation
you entrusted something that you
treasure to somebody who
doesn't know what it's worth and then
when they sold it for less than it's
worth because they think they're
toys you're upset i think you have a
right to be upset but
also in this situation i definitely
don't look at this like the parents did
anything wrong
is basically what it comes down to
i think your parents didn't understand
what the collection was worth to you and
you didn't understand
that for your parents they would
probably like just put that [ __ ] on the
table with like
five dollars or best offer it's
anyway yeah like
i also feel like if you're a collector
like i and maybe this is just me as a
as a person i think i would be like you
know i'd be excited
to put some of the merch out there at
the garage sale and
show up and be like you know let's see
if i can actually sell this to like a
real collector
or or at least like look up the prices
in advance and be like please don't sell
this earthbound for like less than 300
bucks or something like that
anyway just i would say the situation is
uh unfortunate and the reaction is then
over the top but
this this so much this
i'm you gotta you gotta look at uh
some of these posts before you uh before
you click on them
like for example um
this one am i the [ __ ] for separating
my sister
from my nephew
you know let's get spicy
it's a monday i'm i'm ready to go
it's sure it's spelled wrong but
separating is tough
okay that's a tough word
i i never know if you separate with an a
like one is separate and one is separate
my 24 so i always read this wrong man
ops 24 their sister's 35 nephews 13
moved in with me for seven months after
her husband cheated on her and eloped he
is currently absent
she is in financial misery at the moment
that's pretty bad and i don't charge her
for any costs they both have their own
rooms currently just my nephew
i don't know how to read this sentence
and i'm not just trying to be a jerk
about it
what does that mean they both have their
own had their own oh
at one point they had their own rooms
but currently only my nephew
has their own room what happened to the
other room
maybe it's not germane to the point it's
it's locked it's vented
sas okay the problem is my sister
criticized my lifestyle and told me i'm
a bad influence to her son that goes on
for the whole time
to describe myself i am a partner in a
repair service for devices like
smartphones or laptops have very few
friends but which i can trust fully i am
more introverted
not much social i have gaming cigarettes
and energy drink addictions i am
fat slash chubby 108 kilograms 1.83
meters
high okay look can i also say
uh very open with a lot of information
here okay
um i already know where i think i'm
going with this as i'll say
it what i'm gonna say is sure it sounds
like
you might be a little bit of a bad
influence on a 13 year old kid
but it also seems like you're kind of a
good influence on a 13 year old kid by
having the financial
means and the capabilities to take in
your substantially older sister and her
child
which kind of nullifies a lot of the
other stuff i think to some extent
i mean yeah it's his is his house and
his life
i don't have any problems with my nephew
but i teach him my interest if i
interact with him like i disassemble
smartphones show them how to put them
back together think about my work or we
just play pc games and i let him use my
laptop
my sister has problems with it in her
opinion her son shouldn't become like me
the last incident oh no i'm just reading
i i'm my peripheral vision caught pizza
chicken nuggets rick and morty like i i
see
like so many possible hot button issues
coming up
the last instance where i snapped at her
was a month ago
on saturday night i decided to gaming
with pizza chicken nuggets and energy
drinks my nephew has just joined me and
enjoyed his meal
while he watched me playing and binged
rick and morty on smartphone we were up
until 4am
on the next morning i woked up at like 1
p.m
my sister went on a rant against me that
i am an asocial freak
who ruins her child okay i
4am it is a saturday but the kid's 13
like i i can see why this sister would
be a little bit upset by that
she probably should not have called him
any social freak
but that i i would i would think that
maybe the next day i would be like
hey you know my son we're trying to keep
him on like the straight and arrow for
now he's 13 years old
you know he's in seventh grade um if he
could
if you could have him go to bed at
midnight that'd be nice but then also
now that i say that i'm like
why wasn't the sister there to tell the
nephew to go to sleep at midnight or 11
or whatever
instead of relying on the the uncle to
do
it who's only like 10 years older than
the nephew to begin with
that really hurt me because maybe i'm
not as social as other people but i try
to care for my nephew's well-being help
him with school if i have time bring him
shopping
i told her she has to go to our parents
she can't live with me anymore
i have then spoke i've spoken with my
nephew and explained that i cannot stand
my sister anymore and he's welcomed here
whenever he wants
he was furious at my sister sister
packed their stuff and my dad picked her
up but my nephew refused to go with my
sister so basically he is now with me
and we are basically roommates
it's such a good sentence
we're basically roommates it's nothing
weird i'm just yeah
hey that's just my roommate hey he's
learning long division right now give
him
some slack oh
man does he does he
pitch in on the on the rent my parents
and sister told me i should force him to
go but that for me is just cruel and i
refused
okay um that's not right
my nephew is not a difficult child
cleans up after he himself does
does other things if i tell him and
until now he perfectly does his homework
so my sister has to visit us daily to
see her son
she begs me to kick my nephew out but my
nephew just doesn't want to leave and i
don't want to be cruel to my nephew with
kicking him out because he's now in
therapy and just began to improve
am i the ass because i separate my
sister from her child
i don't have a clue what would legally
happen but in the moment we live with
this status quo because nephew's
therapist told my sister not to force
him and he needs stability
wow this is all just a horrible
situation
um
i have no idea what to say
um let's take a
a drink of water first here
let me say i think
the first thing i'd like to say is that
he's it seems like he's being
a good uncle you know my understanding
of the duties of an uncle
you know you're you're kind of like
you've got the responsibility of a
parent
you know for the well-being of the child
but you also
you know you're almost like halfway
between like a parent and a friend but
more on the parents side
is like you i'm trying to think of the
best way to explain it let me put it
this way
you you don't have to maintain the same
kind of authority as an uncle over like
your 13 year old nephew that you do over
your 13 year old child you know
you you you're the boss you're the adult
you're running things but you can also
be like hey you know what you can have
another soda
just don't tell your mom so i think that
he the only thing that maybe crosses the
line
is like letting him stay up until 4am in
my opinion
uh but also you know i mean maybe he
didn't get
a lot of sleep for one night that's not
a good reason to go off
now
kicking your sister out of your house
but allowing your nephew to stay with
you
when it's like safe to go with the mom
definitely seems like kind of a prickly
issue that
you'd want to maybe talk to like a
lawyer or something
i don't know like that's that's a really
tough one
for just an idiot on the internet to
look at it and be like uh
who's right who's in the right and who's
in the wrong here but it's
it's definitely a it's a strange
situation
but let me just say honestly it sounds
like um
it's just a pretty good guy uh
that has gotten himself embroiled in
in a spicy family situation maybe he
doesn't have the healthiest lifestyle
but he also doesn't have a 13 year old
child he's just the
24 year old guy that you know is is
living on his own
and uh you know if he wants to watch
rick and morty and
drink energy drinks and smoke cigarettes
until 4 a.m that's
you're right as a you know a single
person
living alone as an adult with no
dependence you could you could
vibe however you see fit like i mean you
gotta other responsibilities when you're
setting an example for
uh you know your kids and stuff like
that but you know
i i don't think you got to live well
just so your nephew sees
like that it's a good example
yeah you i mean i agree like he
shouldn't be
it's not the best environment for a
teenager to grow up in but i'm also like
i don't know it sounds like your
situation where their mom is totally
messed up as well or with his mom is
totally messed up so
i have no idea um
but that's that's crazy sorry that
happened
uh to you i don't know what to say
i guess he does have a dependent now
yeah he's kind of like
i i don't know i honestly have no idea
um
yeah okay let's put a cork in on that
one he doesn't seem like the [ __ ]
he just uh you know
i don't know what to say he doesn't seem
like the [ __ ]
that's that's what i'll say about that
he might be
committing a felony i don't know if the
therapist advised the child not to leave
i
i'm not qualified to talk about that
sort of that sort of stuff
oh um what was the flare everyone sucks
i think that's fair
i don't i don't necessarily think he
sucks but he's also not
you know above criticism here but if
anything i guess the thing i would say
is i don't think he
deserves criticism for his lifestyle you
know he's doing stuff within the bounds
of the law
and again he's like he's a 24 year old
guy living alone if he wants to
you know torinate himself every day then
then by all means
preferably without the 13 year old kid
living with them but anyway
top golf with pro put full course beta

okay am i the [ __ ] for wearing for
asking my partner
to wear appropriate clothes for a
baseball game every time we have like
uh a an appropriate clothing
based question i realize uh what
percentage of my audience
doesn't live in uh like areas with north
american
fashion norms and i i end up and by the
way which is fine
for the record but i do end up taking
some heat sometimes
from people that are like i live in
malaysia and if you wore that [ __ ] to
the gym here we would
beat you up and i'm like well i don't
live in malaysia
maybe they do i don't know i just gotta
put myself in the shoes
of what i'm familiar with which is that
you know this is
i just assume these all take place like
two blocks away from me
i the [ __ ] for asking my partner to
wear appropriate clothes for a baseball
game
my partner of two years okay so this is
o.p
is the girlfriend and then her partner
is a 26 year old man super into fashion
his aesthetic varies but he loves to
dress up for any occasion he models for
work so he has access to some really
awesome clothes his clothing is
impeccable
and i love his sense of style and
confidence to wear whatever he wants
okay quit bragging
you're the [ __ ] however he has never
met my grandparents in their 80s except
over a handful of family face time calls
so we're taking a trip to their state
seeing my family and specifically having
my partner meet my grandparents
all four of us love baseball so i've
purchased tickets for my grandfather's
favorite team
happens to be the local mlb team the
weekend we are coming
when i told my partner he got super
excited and started planning outfits for
him to wear and get pictures in at the
stadium
i nobody's done anything wrong here at
all
but one of the great things about going
to a sporting event
is you don't have to plan your outfit
you just if you got a jersey you just
put the the jersey on i'm not trying to
flex but there's some times where i'm
like
you know am i am i going to wear the
black skate jersey with no nameplate yet
am i going to wear the uh henrikh sadin
captain jersey because it's you know the
it's alumni night or something but i
mean that only takes like six or seven
hours to figure out okay
normally i would have no issue with
whatever he wore however he was picking
out some of his more expensive items
designer brands printed on them extra
flashy wash
watches and my grandparents are not well
off especially not right now as they're
victims of a pension scam
they will eventually get the money back
but right now they are forced back into
working in our paycheck to paycheck
i asked my partner not to wear designer
clothes so as not to show off to my
grandparents the disparity of wealth is
they have already
i thought he said they sharked their
father and i was like what the heck does
that mean
as they have already shared with my
father they are embarrassed that i'm
paying for our day of baseball together
and that they cannot afford to
contribute anything financially to the
day
forum panda bear thank you for the
gifted subscriptions as well thank you
you can wear whatever you want to the
baseball game aft after the gift subs
this is where things go south i will you
know what this is a
refreshingly rational nobody sucks here
description so far
your boyfriend loves to dress up he he
wants to dress up
you uh don't want him to dress up
because it'll make your grandparents
feel bad about their
you know recently uh made worse
financial situation
seems totally fair so far he claims that
i am not supportive of his
sense of style and because he dresses
sometimes more feminine or androgynous
i'm embarrassed to bring him to the game
with my grandparents
i am not embarrassed i just don't want
my grandparents feeling like they don't
fit in they've seen him on social media
posts in some of the magazine campaigns
he's been in wearing skirts and such
and they've been nothing but excited to
meet him he says i'm an
[ __ ] if he can't wear the clothes he
wants he won't go so am i the [ __ ]
hmm this is a tough one
can i say um i kind of feel like this is
a nobody sucks here
which is kind of just copping the flare
let me let me say something here okay
cause i got burned by this last week and
i've been waiting for an opportunity to
turn it around
i do think it's a little bit
unreasonable
that it seems like you politely asked
your boyfriend to wear
a different outfit for the game and then
he said if i can't wear what i want i
don't want to go
but if we put the shoe on the other foot
and the boyfriend was speaking to the
girlfriend and going hey could you not
wear that
to the baseball game because it might
make my grandparents uncomfortable
i think that people would be like your
boyfriend's an [ __ ] for issuing you
like an
ultimatum like that so or it they would
be like
i understand why she feels like i just
don't want to go at all now
so and it's a pretty on the severity
scale
like this is like a 2 out of 10 [ __ ]
level versus
you know the lady who left her nephew
with her
24 year old brother but anyway um
i can understand even though i don't
care about fashion
at all except for the streamer drip
i can understand you know if you're
especially if you're a model and you
take pride in you know expressing
yourself through your outfit
you're like this is what i want to wear
it's special for me i'm excited to plan
on my outfit and then someone's like
don't wear that wear like you know
blue jeans and a tucked in plaid shirt
you'd be like okay fine then maybe i
just don't want to go
because it's it is trying to stifle some
autonomy to some degree
but let's go down a little bit further
here
this was asked in a private message but
it might shed light on the subject
my partner's family is not well off and
he would never dress the way he wants to
with my grandparents
this behavior is not normal for him
especially because he doesn't often own
the clothes he wears and he specifically
bought these for the trip to wear to the
game
i don't know what that means this uh my
partner's family is not well off he
would never dress the way he wants to
with my grandparents
this behavior is not normal for him so
you think your boyfriend's gone crazy
um i don't get it
i think it's supposed to be his
grandparents
okay maybe it still doesn't make that
much sense to me
um when around his family of a different
belief system than i
i choose to wear modest clothing and
have head coverings for when it's
appropriate
as that is a part of their religion and
want to be respectful they are not
wealthy
do you have everybody's tax returns
why are you familiar with absolutely
every person's financial situation
like i know how i'm doing
and i got like a temperature on like my
parents
and nobody else i don't know how anybody
else is doing on planet earth at all
does she is she an auditor for the irs i
don't
how does she know her boyfriend's i
guess probably because her boyfriend
told her but
um anyway
they are not wealthy and a part of their
religion is not just physical modesty
but also how you present yourself
he never wears work clothes to his own
family functions
this is one of those situations where um
i feel like this person has become
much more invested in being right in the
argument than in actually coming to the
resolution because now instead of like
how do i
which i guess is what i'm that am i the
[ __ ] for to begin with
but instead of being like how can we
resolve this situation
she's like let me keep adding more
context that makes it appear like i'm
obviously not in the uh
in the wrong here i don't know this is
uh
it's a weird one
i feel first off this situation is a not
that big of a deal to begin with
can i say uh something that is uh that
people might take as uh honestly pretty
rude
but your grandparents are in their 80s
i think there's a little like you you
gotta
let your boyfriend wear whatever he
wants and if they're in their 80s and
they're like
he made a bad impression because he's
wearing a 500 t-shirt
like that's kind of their problem
you know like they they've lived through
the cold war
oh my granddaughter's boyfriend is
wearing like a
balenciaga t-shirt like who cares
like you can't keep them safe from
having like a wealth displayed in front
of them like on the drive to the game
they're going to drive by
maybe you know like some super cars or
something like that
don't tell them how much the the players
on the field are making like i think
she's overthinking
uh you know trying to make them
yeah she's she's trying to protect them
from the drip which i don't i don't know
if it's
i think it's it's trying to shelter
somebody who has you know
lived a long life
i don't know i i feel like you know are
you gonna put it put them in a blindfold
or something so they don't see that
there's people around them wearing
yeezys or something like that i don't
know
anyway long story short i i don't
necessarily think anybody's like a huge
[ __ ] here
i don't have the sigma grind set i feel
like if i asked kate like hey
maybe could you change your outfit for
dinner with my parents and she was like
uh
i'll tell you what how about i just
don't go i'd be like you know what you
look great
let's get on the road
[Laughter]
we're already 10 minutes late probably
so we should probably just go anyway
just to me this doesn't seem like that
big of a deal i mean at this point i
feel like if i were the boyfriend i
would resent being in what appears to be
a long argument
over like whether or not i can wear like
this shirt to the
cardinals game it just seems like that
if anything it's like a red flag that
it's
it's such a problem i guess
anyway we're gonna keep it moving
but for now



i'm gonna throw a slash marker in there
let's uh
let's see what else we got here there's
been some good posts this week for sure
emma am i the [ __ ] for blocking my
neighbor from parking his car in front
of my house
oh man this is this comes up in
vancouver all the time i'm sure there's
going to be more info
um so i had to scroll down
um it's this happens in vancouver all
the time
people will like literally put a sign
on their front lawn that's like please
do not
park here i need to park here this is my
house
and i'm like it's it's the street
i'm sorry to tell you like i mean i
i would love to also park in front of my
house at all times
but you don't it's a public road i gotta
go to maybe like my friend's house my
friend lives across the street
i'm gonna park there if that's the best
parking spot it's how she goes
plus you got a driveway usually or or
like a garage
and i'm like you can't what do you got
like six cars get over it
um anyway so maybe i'm the [ __ ] but
let's see
we'll see i've lived in my home oh let's
start with the title of course
oh you don't if you block someone's
driveway that's a different story that
that makes
yta for sure am i the [ __ ] for
blocking my neighbor from parking his
car in front of my house
i've lived in my home since it was
constructed 15 years ago there's 12
houses on our street with six houses on
each side of the street if one of the
houses always lies and all adjacent
houses must tell the truth
how many houses do you need to ask a
question to in order to determine
the correct answer all the houses are
three or four bedrooms with two car
garages my house is the third
from the corner of a public road
three or four three or well is yours
three
or four i would need apparently i need
to know
all of the pertinent details is it
hardwood is it carpeting
what does your banister look like do you
have a wooden banister do you have a
metal banister this is going to change
everything man
okay hold on i'm assuming that the
geography is relevant they're third from
the corner on a public road
the unwritten rule on our street is if
you need to park on the street you park
in front of your house and not someone
else's
makes a lot of sense of course if you
have a get-together or workers coming
over no one minds if you park in front
of their house as long as you're not
making a habit of it
also seems reasonable
the house two doors down from me which
is on the corner with the public road
sold new people moving six adults living
in a three-bedroom house they each have
their own vehicle
okay that's [ __ ]
[Laughter]
six cars one house i can see where
things start to get a little dramatic
here
i wake up the next morning to put the
trash out there's a car parked in front
of my house
there's three other cars parked on the
street one in front of my next door
neighbors
one in front of each of the two houses
on the opposite side of the street i was
a bit annoyed but brush it off expecting
it will be moved soon it wasn't moved
for three days
apparently the new people have the
garage packed so they park two cars in
the driveway and four on the street
i keep my corvette in the garage but i
keep my old beat up in the driveway
along with my wife's car
as after the car moved i parked my truck
on the street in front of my house
later that evening someone rings my
doorbell the guy asked if i can move my
truck into my driveway so he can park in
front of my house i tell him i can but
i'm not going to
he says they have six cars and not
enough room to park on their property i
tell them it sounds like they bought a
property too small for their needs and
shut the door am i the [ __ ]
um
obligatory based based
based owned because there's there's a
there's a multi-faceted issue this is
kind of like this is my bread and butter
because there's no
legality being violated here whatsoever
that makes it a cut and dry situation
it's exclusively in those blurred lines
in the margins of
unspoken human behavior and as they've
said it themselves
unwritten rules right um there's no
reason he should have to move his truck
um in order for them to be able to park
that's for sure
and i also feel like six cars to one
home
is you should be able to buy whatever
you want to buy i think as long as you
can you know support it without
inconveniencing others
but at some point when you got six cars
in one
house surely
you gotta like can you carpool or so can
you sell like two
cars and then carpool a little bit like
it's it's just seems a little
crazy to me like what what are you gonna
do like
that's it at a high enough level of cars
where you're like that's audacious
like one car per person in the home
like you you really can't double up at
all regardless
you know i i
i digress
now so i op i think doesn't have to
mess with things at all you know they
they can they're well within their
rights here can i ask you a question
though
and this is where maybe we're going to
get into some trouble
why if he can park his uh
his car in the driveway
and in the garage why is he so
annoyed that they have
that they're parking in front of his
house
it sounds like his parking situation was
totally fine
it just it annoys him that they're
parking their car in front of his
property
which i can understand like i i think i
would look
out and be like whoa that car's been
here for a while hey come on
but it it seems like parking his own
truck on the street is just something he
did to be like hey
park someplace else because like it's
like you don't you nobody
takes advantage of me even if it doesn't
hurt me at all
so i i kind of see this i don't know man
i mean i was gonna say is everybody
sucks here
but in spite of what i said about uh
about the fact that i don't think he
should care
i will also say like
i don't think he's an [ __ ] for
taking the parking in front of his own
place
i mean even if he didn't want to park
his car in the driveway
and he wanted to just park his car on
the street anywhere he's not really an
[ __ ] he's a little rude maybe
opie has three cars in a four bedroom
house for one person
well i don't know if it's one person for
one but also
if he's got two cars or three cars but
he keeps them all on his property he's
not inconveniencing anybody else
he said he has a wife oh there you go
i mean i don't care if you have like a
thousand cars as long as they're like
you know in the garage or or maybe
parked in front of your place
anyway it's uh i mean i
i think if anything i think you're kind
of an [ __ ]
i understand the economic reality the
situation i suppose
but uh you're kind of an [ __ ] for
moving six people into a three-bedroom
house and
everybody has their own vehicle like
that's just too is there
too many cars tmc like i don't even know
if they're jerks i just feel like
they're
they're that's a tmc there's a too many
cars situation
i and then i actually i'm gonna go a
step further
i think the guy who asked hey can you
move your truck so i can park my car
there
is actually the super [ __ ]
because why don't you just park further
away
like you don't have you don't get
priority access to the parking spot
that's closest
to your house just because of the fact
that like it's closest to your house you
know what i mean
well and you could use that against the
corvette guy i guess but
you know what your inconveniencing or
you're
going to be inconvenienced because you
have too many cars to
fit into your own property just get with
this
is a vancouver special man you know how
many times like i park i look for street
parking to go somewhere and the closest
street parking i can find is like you
know a
three or four minute walk away
so what happens when you got a tmc
situation you got too many damn cars
op didn't have to be a jerk about it
though you know what you know why
in my opinion that he had to uh ben
shapiro this guy
because there's he's he's in the right
on a logical level the argument flows i
think that he's in the right there's no
reason he has to not park his car there
but there's absolutely no like
moral reason that he did it
so he had to like burn he had to
get a burn in there and be like i've
owned you with facts and logic
because otherwise if his neighbor was
just like yeah but you're not really
using it
like why do you care so much then he
would have to look inside of himself
and be like that's a good point i don't
know why i guess it's because
all this stuff the corvette the
three-bedroom house
it's all because i don't like what's
going on in here it's i i try to project
this image of
rugged individualism and ends up
expressing itself in toxic ways like
needlessly parking my car on the street
in such a way to inconvenience others
just because i thought they were taking
advantage of me when really
they probably didn't pay any mind to it
and were just trying to do the thing
that was most frictionless for their own
existence
anyway too many cars though like way way
too many come on six cars three people
or six cars three bedrooms
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting alcohol
at my wedding and suggesting
alternatives
is there any way this could
possibly be the [ __ ]
i it's your wedding and
you can do whatever you want
wait it says [ __ ] okay i gotta i
gotta know more
how did this happen how badly did you
mess up that you end up being the
[ __ ] in this situation
so i male 22 and my fiance female 22
just got engaged we live in southern
california
and plan to get married next june the
issue is catering since i have extended
family in canada and friends in new
zealand i'd like to pay for a decent
reception
my fiance agrees however the problem is
that she said we need to have alcohol at
the wedding i drink extremely rarely and
my immediately family immediate family
barely does
also my extended family doesn't really
drink my fiance said her friends and
family would expect us to have alcohol
because it's the thing to do
i suggest that we have people bring
their own or we can have an after party
with drinks
but she said that if we do not have
alcohol some people might not even come
and it is an absolute necessity
i've just noticed the edit is 40 times
longer
than the actual post itself
that's crazy um this is
it's too far um am i the [ __ ]
for not wanting to have to spend
thousands of extra on alcohol for also
thinking we should go without alcohol
anyway i don't want people to come to a
special wedding to celebrate with us and
just be there for the alcohol
i've been pushing back but she's very
angry with me thoughts
this is gonna be good because right now
not the [ __ ] just uh you know the
kind of thing that comes up when two
people have like a different idea for
what an event is gonna look like
i don't think your fiance is necessarily
out of line for suggesting
you know that i mean different people
have different ideas of what a wedding
is going to look like right
like some people are are going there um
to see like you know their nephew get
married and they're 87 years old
some people are going there because they
went to college with the groom
and they're there to like see their
friend off but also to get
shmammied so like different people are
gonna have different
ideas of what a wedding is gonna look
like i'm sure including the the bride
and the groom
i certainly don't i mean i think if you
have people who are like i'm not gonna
come to the wedding unless there's
alcohol like
then those people you should not be
paying you know like 150 to 300
per head to cater a dinner and get a
venue for them in the first place
[Laughter]
those anybody that would not come to
your wedding
simply because it's dry is probably
somebody that shouldn't be
invited in the first place but anyway so
far seems fairly pedestrian
edit the family and friend from far away
have an interesting
relationship with alcohol as in some
past alcoholics some against it in
general should have cleared that up
i understand you know you again if you
have like you know
either teetotalers or you know
recovering alcoholics in your family
that would make it
an even more tight situation further
edit
the way we were going before alcohol
came up was we were going to rent a
community center and have an outside
caterer come in for the reception the
ceremony is at a different close-by
place i'm from socal and so everything
price-wise is god tier now lol
my fiancee just graduated college and is
starting subbing
i'm entering my senior year i work or
will work 40 to 50 hours a week and she
works hard too
the money aspect is that we are trying
to pay off all our loans by marriage and
afford all these other things she wants
a dog nice apartment etc which i totally
support
our budget for the whole wedding is 10k
not because we're frugal but because
that's literally all we'd have for it so
my money concern is that
since we were able to get everything
including photography food cake dress
etc
getting alcohol too since the community
center would also then require insurance
and security guards since alcohol
ridiculous i know would push us
way over
it you say it best when you say nothing
at all
to be honest i'm surprised by the
absolute necessity of alcohol but if
that's the culture i get it i'm down to
do it but now i'm just in a hard place i
looked it over
the community center requires alcohol to
be from behind the bar
so we can't do bring your own yeah like
i you're only 22 years old but duh
like i don't if you if you're renting a
venue for a wedding i think they're like
hey are you cool if we just like bring
like our own uh
drinks and and food as well um so we
can't do bring your own should i look
for a completely different venue or
caterer to go with the catering drink
options
the starting price of a caterer we're
going with with paid bar would be around
four thousand dollars for open bar they
don't do paid bar for some reason
i apologize to my fiance thanks to
everyone for the con
the comments and concerns none of this
is that bad
i really i thought this was gonna be
explosive
um but it's actually like a pretty
normal situation i'm very surprised to
see
that uh
that they've been listed as the [ __ ]
we accidentally went to the normal
subreddit this is not the filtered one
so i got to read the comments
so does your desire not to drink
supersede her right to serve alcohol
maybe if alcohol was a trigger for you
if you had a drinking problem but just
out of a sense of frugality
this seems to jump into the realm of
just being cheap you're the [ __ ]
i've never disagreed with like a top
comment more in my entire life
i i mean like
[Laughter]
i just i'm why it's so dramatic
your desire to not drink supersede her
right to serve
alcohol look it sounds like it's not
just a desire to not drink it's also a
desire
to you know save maybe four thousand
dollars on the catering
which is a concern with some relevance i
say
that being said i will also say if your
fiance
you know if her dream wedding has always
involved like some kind of
component of alcohol i mean that's why
you shouldn't have brought it to the
internet in the first place but i'm glad
you did
it's the situation you shouldn't let
reddit get involved
i don't see why people seem to think
they need an open bar in the uk paying
for drinks at weddings is pretty common
or the couple put x amount behind the
bar and then the guests pay for
themselves once that runs out
in the usa it would be between very and
extremely tacky to have guests buy drink
from the bar at your wedding
they could just serve beer if they
wanted or serve a limited amount of
drinks i've been to both but never a
wedding that asked me to pay for the
drinks
dude i'm every like day that goes on
i'm so happy that kate and i basically
just got married
by like uh an officiant at a restaurant
and then like ate lunch and took a nap
i guess i i should it's not like oh we
made such an incredible decision i guess
we're just lucky that we were
both aligned when it comes to that to
begin with
but i can't imagine like
the i the idea that it's tacky to buy
drinks at an open bar
or to to ask people to buy drinks at
your wedding
i mean like i went to josh's wedding
okay there were like 200 people there
maybe maybe more you're catering a
dinner
plus drinks for 200 people i don't mind
like i'm i'm first off i'm very thankful
that josh
invited me and i'll and invited kate as
well
but then like some of the people that
were there you're like i don't mind
catering at dinner
for like my uncle and my aunts and my
cousins and of course my parents
and you know my close friends but then
when you get into
uh this person you know they met you
when you were 12 they were 50 it's your
great uncle brian
also your great uncle brian had just
started dating
somebody three months ago and by the way
she's got like an eight drink minimum
you're like you at that point you're
you're maybe paying like 200 bucks
for this lady you've never met to like
eat and and drink on your dime like i
don't
i'm not say i think it's too easy to be
like oh you're just being cheap i'm like
this
is a lot man open bar doesn't need to be
expensive though ours was like
500 bucks including a bartender that is
it's not expensive
when you know consider the amount but it
it's like it must scale right
it's not like there's a it's 500 and
then if people drink 2 000
worth of alcohol you just got you know
everything for 75 percent off
yeah have you considered that everything
is uh god to your prices here in socal
lol by the way
anyway
just moving just moving yeah what about
a cash bar with like two drink tokens
that doesn't buy i i don't mind paying
for like you know
somebody i don't know to have like
two johnny walkers or something like
that but
if somebody if somebody comes up to
you know they're drinking 15 shots of
vodka
and they barely know us i'm like that
that's where i'm i'm just wondering why
it's such a norm
that being said for the record if kate
and i
ever like renew our vows and have like a
more traditional ceremony
we're not gonna cheap out we're gonna
maybe even three drink tokens per guest
and i think we could invite upwards of
like eight to twelve people
so i'm just saying i might be a little
bit of a hypocrite but
no chad's definitely not invited people
are saying it's your wedding it's your
choice but it's also your fiance's
wedding and she wants the alcohol i
don't drink but i know people expect
alcohol at weddings they get crazy about
it
your fiance likely just wants to make
her guests happy it's hard to give a
judgment on this
i think that's fair that that all seems
fair to me
i don't think that either op
or uh opgf are the
[ __ ] necessarily sounds like she just
wants to put on a wedding that's going
to be amenable for the people that she
invites
what is the [ __ ] i think here is the
uh
the fact that wedding culture at least
in north america is that like
you know there absolutely has to be an
open bar
otherwise like what a disaster
i think a cash bar is like i mean isn't
a cash bar like the most implicitly
fair situation to begin with if you
don't want to drink you don't pay if you
want to get hammered you pay through the
nose
and also i mean just when you look at it
through
and we're not even doing react court
here now i'm just going off
but like the couple is already facing
like a substantial
financial burden for throwing an event
that's basically like a
you know we say we repeat a couple of
words like we're doing the cha-cha slide
then we eat a meal then we're doing the
cha-cha slide
um and then you're like by the way
pay for everybody to get hammered and
then you're like well this seems like a
little much they're like i bought you a
bread maker
so you got to pay for me to get hammered
otherwise it would be tacky you don't
want to be tacky would you
if anything you should be throwing a
cash bar
to be and like hey every two bucks from
every drink purchase goes back to the
bride and groom for throwing this sick
party
but i i don't think the world's ready
for that one yet
i don't i don't know if planet earth is
is ready for this one also you're 22 as
asking a 22 year old to pay for an open
bar
like they they only legally were able to
start drinking like a year ago it seems
like they're committing a crime
they went from not being able to buy
alcohol to being able to buy an
unlimited amount of alcohol
anyway am i the [ __ ] for getting sad
at my boyfriend because he asked me to
knock every time i come in
oh man
deleted
i gotta know
deleted well you i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna pry any deeper than that
but
it's there's gone they even deleted
their account man
am i the [ __ ] for not inviting my
fiance's siblings to the wedding
[ __ ] dude a lot of wedding based ones
too
i'm not gonna go to the wayback machine
and
screw them to figure out you thought you
could delete this [ __ ]
absolutely not i guarantee the kind of
person that would ask their girlfriend
to knock before they entered
um is the kind of person that probably
is a turbo redditor and i bet they found
it that's my head canon
comments always have a backup they keep
the mfn thing on them
my uh 34 and i 28 are getting married in
february of next year we have always
liked the idea of a child free wedding
look so i just
spent like
15 minutes being like it's your wedding
you can do whatever you want
now you you've come up with like the one
counter example let me say okay
you can have a child free wedding if you
want
okay if you wanted to be like adults
only for whatever reason
more power to you however
you should invite like nine people
because otherwise you're gonna end up
like if we got invited to
a child-free wedding they were like no
kids
like now i'm like just to go to your
wedding i gotta like
pay a babysitter like a hundred dollars
that no kids at the ceremony is also is
strange i mean you would
the thing is we'd have to be like close
friends you know for me to accept that
so i would i would probably
we'd be much more likely to just say no
anyway like
here's here's what i'm getting at okay
now my fiance comes from a large family
and has six siblings under the age of
18.
first off holy [ __ ]
you have six your fiance is 34
they have six siblings under the age of
18.
that's crazy um by the way
you have the right to do whatever you
want to do in that realm
but my god that's uh
that's kind of staggering six siblings
at all
is uh is a decent number for sure
six under the age of 18 is is kind of
crazy
um anyway uh what was i saying um
you i mean i i gotta read the whole
thing okay
but yeah i think if you're getting
married and you're like oh we're not
having kids so
i'm not inviting six of your younger
siblings
yeah this is kind of a dick that's me
you can you not just have like
a i don't know i feel like it's one of
those things where i'm like you can't
have your cake and eat it too or at
least it's gonna be hard
you know if you've always wanted to have
a child free wedding
and simultaneously you have six siblings
between the ages of 9 and 18
you are a little stupid and naive
quite frankly unless unless you're going
to elope to las vegas with
get married by elvis with nobody in the
audience like
how are you going to get that one
accomplished
anyway uh we are also having an open bar
and while we don't plan on being sloshed
we can't speak for others wink wink so
we just don't
think it's the best environment for kids
to be in plus parents deserve a night of
fun
yeah i've always thought that as a
parent i deserve a night of fun
where the insinuation is i will get so
irresponsibly intoxicated
that it wouldn't be a good environment
for children to be in
you know why why would we want children
to be at a dance
where alcohol is served what are you
going to do are you going to
i don't would you start taking craps on
the floor i don't understand
anyway by the way thank you also for for
choosing uh as well for the
pa and i get that i'm biased as we have
a you know a child but
thanks for choosing for me that i can't
just uh
bring my child and then you know one of
us chooses to be the dd and the other
one can cut loose a little bit instead
it's literally not allowed
really appreciate that anyway our first
battle was choosing not to have my
goddaughter
who is seven as the flower girl because
of our no child policy
you're going to get a there's no
exception made for the
uh the flower girl
you're gonna have a flower girl who's
over you're at your
child free wedding you're gonna have a
flower girl but she's got to be over the
age of 18. it's a job that is
predominantly done by
like a four-year-old okay now
my okay she was upset because of our no
child policy
what an [ __ ] um my sister was upset
at first about her
her daughter being left out but finally
came around to a kid-free idea
sister not the [ __ ] now my fiance
comes from a large family and still has
six siblings under the age of 18 their
ages are between 16 and 9.
he said early on if we are doing a child
free wedding we are not making
exceptions for
anyone however when we told his parents
the kids weren't invited they were quick
to snap back and say we were out of line
for not including them
we explained ourselves and explained how
we wanted them to actually enjoy the
night rather than worry about kids all
night
okay i mean it does get more complicated
two of his siblings are tube fed
non-verbal and do not do well with
crowds of people
it that definitely took a turn
his parents fought on insist
can i can i say something though i feel
like
two of like this is kind of a jerk
move from the for the fiance to say
also
it's her unless i'm misreading this okay
it's it's their wedding
and they can kind of do whatever they
want
but not inviting
your fiance is like really
ill siblings
because you think they're gonna have a
bad time
puts you on a moral low ground for sure
like if i get that it's your
wedding you should get whatever you want
but they just want to like
watch if anything if you could make a
situation
to make it a little easier for them to
watch or or less
you know less triggering for them that
might be for the best
anyway sorry let me let me keep reading
it just keeps getting more complicated
we explained ourselves explain how we
wanted to enjoy the night uh they
brought up his older sister
who just had a baby needs to be able to
bring her child we once again
said no at least
they are sticking with their principles
and not making exceptions that's
that gives them some moral consistency
at least
we sent out invites and made sure to
list two seat on his parents
invitation once again we are at war
and are being told we're wrong we have
already told other family members no
children permitted and we don't want to
look like we're picking and choosing
which kids can come so are we the
[ __ ] here
this is something where i think you well
let's read the edit
i'm seeing a lot of comments about
inviting kids to the ceremony and not
the reception
and while that in a perfect world which
obviously we don't live in because we're
at war would be a great compromise
this is a destination wedding
also they do have their own care
providers for the kids and they've
traveled with them before when they did
family vacations
or they just have the wait hold on
you're so you do
it was not just
driving to the church going to the
banquet hall
and then going home to your kids that
night
you're you're flying to cancun or like
cabo san lucas or something like that
and you're either leaving your kid
at home in the states at which point
you've got like i don't know either
family or like a live-in babysitter for
a few days
or you're paying for a plane ticket to
fly your kids to the destination wedding
at which point they can't go to the
wedding
it sounds like they want to go wait hold
on they did family vacations or just
have the older kids help out it sounds
like they want to go for the latter for
this trip so it's totally possible
they're not having it
this is crazy i mean i think you're
you can be in the right
and still be an [ __ ] if that makes
sense
i think it on your wedding you know
there's a day where you and your spouse
can choose
you can experience the day however you
want it you know but as soon as you
start
wanting other people to come
a little bit of compromising is in order
if you want them to come and be happy
about it
but at the end of the day you do have
you know the final say on what's
acceptable at your wedding and what's
not
so if you want to have a complete child
free wedding then by all means
uh a child free destination wedding
where you want other people to come and
just figure out a way to deal with their
kids for like a few days
i mean that seems like that's that would
be one of the easiest no's of my life i
guess is what i would say
you know you my personal philosophy and
not everybody is going to agree with
this
but is like you should make the wedding
is about you and your spouse in a
celebration of that
but you also
want people to jump through like as few
hoops as possible
to be there if that makes sense
like i i am on a razor's edge to saying
no to just about any
social engagement at all if if they i
got invited to a wedding i'd be like
great let's go if they were like you got
to wear a suit i'd be like
fine if they were like it's a willy
wonka themed wedding and you're going to
we'd prefer the suit would be purple i
would be like i
got plants that day i'm sorry there's
like one
you can add in like one or two
conditions
everybody has to wear slippers oh that's
kind of cute it's
and funny glasses i'm like i no no thank
you
so and this is a hundred times worse
than that
this is just an [ __ ] wedding
the final verdict is [ __ ]
i can't believe there's a no [ __ ]
here but anyway
but it doesn't it it i think it makes
them an [ __ ] but simultaneously
again they have the right to do whatever
they want to do right like
that being said you can still be an
[ __ ]
like you could yell really loudly in
your cell phone in like a quiet
restaurant
it's not illegal but you're kind of the
[ __ ]
you already know the the demo it's not
the [ __ ] because like it's your day
and also on reddit people are like i
hate kids
like i get that look
i am not i'm an only child so you know
i've been able to be very flexible or
inflexible my whole life because like
you know whatever i want to cook myself
for dinner especially as an adult i was
like i'm good
um but like if you got like nine
siblings
or something six siblings between nine
and 18 like
you might have to make some compromises
if you want your family to be a part of
your big day
like i know the way people would look at
this is like
uh the sister what a [ __ ] she just had
a baby and now she wants to bring her
baby
to the wedding and it's gonna maybe cry
and it's gonna ruin
my day okay i mean babies do be crying
there's no doubt about that
but as someone who just had like a
newborn
less than a year ago you know especially
in the first couple of months when
they're out
they need to like you know they need to
be around the parents at all times
they they might cry for sure
but you know they poop 10 times a day
they
you know need to nurse constantly so
like if you if you want your sister to
come to the wedding you're gonna also
need to allow the baby to be there it's
not like she's just
gonna leave it at the hospital or
something
which i can i say this is another great
reason to invite like
six people to your wedding it really
simplifies the problem
my wedding was like me kate
and our parents and kate's grandma
that's it
it was it was easy no babies because we
you know there was
nobody of a baby age even involved with
it whatsoever we had a child free
wedding
what we didn't do is be like you know
let's invite a hundred people and tell
them they can't take their newborns
anyway
um i don't know bad person [ __ ] i
don't know am i the [ __ ] for
villainizing my husband deleted
okay am i the [ __ ] for uh
refusing to pay property tax on a condo
i have no legal ownership of
this for this to get 500 upvotes there
must be something juicy here
because this seems like such an obvious
no
oh no i i got to the the main threat
again
uh am i the [ __ ] for refusing to pay
property tax on a condo i have no legal
ownership of
a little context my wife and i received
a very large sum of money from her
parents to use as a down payment on a
new property
hey jay call off the dogs
call off the dogs chad we don't know yet
we haven't don't judge them based on the
fact that they received help from their
parents
we should be happy for them until they
get interviewed
by bloomberg about how to pay for their
home and
you won't believe how this 24 year old
paid off for student loans i
you know ate ramen noodles for every
meal i uh
made sure to uh get day olds from the
donut shop so that i didn't have to buy
any doughnuts and also my parents gave
me 750
000 until they do that we don't we don't
judge them we're happy for them we'd all
like to be in the same situation
i wasn't in a financial position to
commit to a mortgage because i'm a
student okay
three words later or something like that
i'm already like
if if your wife's parents
give you money for a down payment
you gotta use it to buy a house
that's the catch okay i don't know if
that's where it's going
it sounds like it got a lot of money to
make a down payment
and then he was like i don't want to get
into that sort of commitment and i'm
hoping he didn't buy like a bunch of
bubba coin or something but
um while i have a little bit of income
through scholarships and part-time work
it's nowhere near enough to commit to
that kind of purchase my wife decided if
i didn't want to commit to a mortgage
she would just buy the property herself
and use the income from her other
property that her parents bought for her
that she rents out to pay for the new
condo okay i
regret um putting myself as a human
shield here
i my own personal thoughts
notwithstanding i think it let him have
it
oh i don't feel comfortable paying a
mortgage myself personally
oh that's fine uh i'll just buy it then
and i'll use the income from the other
suite to pay off the mortgage
called pulling yourself up by your
bootstraps sweetie
the condition to this was that i had to
sign away my legal ownership of the new
property
as i would not be paying for it i agreed
we already have a prenup that this just
continued to
the trend of keeping our finances
separated
after closing on the property and moving
in my wife informed me she needs me to
start paying the property tax
as a form of rent for me living there
with her
hold on so i'm just i'm
this is when two libertarians get
married i'm trying to put myself into
the mindset okay
i'm i'm trying to get myself in their
shoes
i don't even understand the situation
okay so we have
wife wife has rich parents the parents
bought wife
uh income property
okay i'm on the i'm on the level right
now
they also gave wife and husband
the money to buy or to pay for a down
payment on their own house to live in
okay husband said that's a lot of
commitment
i don't want to be a part of that wife
said i'll just buy it and
all pay the mortgage with
the income that the other people are
grinding themselves to the bond for for
my income suite
uh all right but husband and wife are
living in property too all right i
understand
now wife wants husband
to pay rent in the form of property tax
as penance for living in the house can i
tell you something
despite what i just said and despite the
fact that it's
insane to ask your husband to pay rent
i'm actually like almost
a little bit on her side just because
like they are both living in the place
and she whether or not she's earning the
money
she is taking part of her
income to pay the living expenses for
both of them
in a house that they share it does sound
oh i'm getting minus two out the gourd
wait no okay immediately chad raised
like 17 good points
one of them is he doesn't have any legal
ownership
that is true because he doesn't have
legal ownership why should he have to
pay for any part of the house
well because he lives in it but then
that's not your wife that's just a
landlord
which you could kind of have
a little of both but it okay it's weird
it is a little weird yeah um
i don't know let's see where this goes
it's all it's spicy already
um anyway after closing on the property
my wife informed me i need to start
paying the property tax
as it is the form of rent for me living
there with her
and while we've been splitting rent our
whole relationship it rubs me the wrong
way that she
had me give up ownership on the property
but then expects me to help pay for the
pardon me the property the money going
towards the taxes may as well be going
towards the mortgage
well sir i can see you're not an
accounting uh
student because even if you're paying a
mortgage you are definitely
also paying your property tax still but
you know i i digress
is i'm just saying it's not an
apples-to-apples comparison
at that point what is the point of me
giving up ownership instead of just
owning the condo together
ffs we've been married for years i feel
like i'm being financially exploited i
don't make much money
over the summer since i'm not attending
summer classes and she knew that going
into
she knew that going into it but in order
for her to cover what she owes to the
bank
she even demanded that i give her the
300
my parents gave me for my birthday
bruh oh no no
when your girl boss wife landlord
demands your birthday money you got from
your parents
oh man um
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to pay um
this is a tough one
let's read more previously when we were
splitting ren we each paid 1100 bucks
when she agreed to buy the condo i
agreed to pay for the insurance and all
the utilities
okay she wants me to pay her hundred
dollars
every month on top of all the utility
splitting food
etc where on earth
is uh
your property tax is fourteen hundred
1400 a month
this is like 18 000 a year
property i mean when you put it that way
and the fact that they paid 2200 for
rent
i mean i guess maybe they just live in
like an expensive city
yeah and and then property taxes is high
and maybe their place is worth like
seven or eight or nine or a million or
something like that
anyway that's that's a lot in vancouver
property tax is disgustingly low
like it's unless you have like a vacant
property
i mean for you to be paying 1400 a month
i think you would need to own like a
like a 9 or 10 million dollar house but
that's which is why i always laugh when
people here complain about property
tax yeah i gotta pay like you know
three thousand dollars a year for my
five million dollar house it's crazy
anyway long story short let's keep it
going i feel like i need to explain
better this should be good
i'm still stunned that their property
tax is fourteen hundred dollars
anyway whatever uh i was never expecting
to not pay anything
we each have separate bank accounts but
also a mutual bank account
she uses her personal account for the
rental income from her
other property i use my personal account
for my disability income from the va
any income that i would have saved by
not paying rent
would be put in one of the joint
accounts
my problem is that this is taking money
from our joint bank account
and putting it into her personal account
to then be transferred to the bank for
the mortgage
or to pay property taxes or whatever the
hell whatever the else
my brain is dead whatever the hell else
she wants to do with it
well um
look i don't have this situation
uh so it's hard to relate to you know
we're
we uh basically just pool everything
and this is very complicated i mean i
think this is one of the reasons that
like
i wouldn't want to do this
because it seems kind of uh like there's
a a
weird accounting system and also
uh like maybe a power imbalance as a
result of it
it's just it is a very weird energy for
for a married couple
i'm not saying you can't keep your
finances separated to some extent when
you're married
but also like isn't there
like uh
like legally speaking whatever they're
doing isn't it just
oh because they have a prenup never mind
okay i was gonna say like i mean you can
keep your finances as separate as you
want but i'm pretty sure like after
you've been married for six months in
the eyes of the law is 50 50 depending
on where you live but then again i also
don't know that
[Laughter]
either way i'm like uh
i do understand what the guy is saying
in the sense that
it sucks that he is not
going to uh be getting any equity
but is expected to pay the property tax
however
i do also and this is
merely from a business standpoint this
is this is
ignoring the fact that they're married
[Laughter]
but like
she is paying i know that technically
it's
the tenants that she has that are paying
or her parents
but she on if you treat her as an
entity financially she is paying
for the living arrangement now she's
getting equity out of it as well
it sounds like she would rather be like
i mean just my two cents
i would like to think that if i had this
relationship i would be like
you're my husband i'm not going to
charge you rent
but apparently she is a ruthless
objective capitalist and and she goes
over the balance sheet in the income
statement
every month and and then goes uh
you know hey this freeloader is he's
taking 1400 bucks a month out of my
pocket
he's trying to live here without you
know helping us out at all
um yeah you know what
you're absolutely right it sounds like
he should he should move out
and then expose himself to the free
market of rental inventories and see if
he can get a better deal
and then maybe if he gets an agreement
for that he can bring it to his wife
landlord and be like are you willing to
match this offer
i'm not willing to pay you 1400 a month
for the property tax
however i did just find a studio
apartment across town for 900 bucks
if you're willing to meet me in the
middle and you match that offer then i
would be happy to uh
to consider it you know two can play
that game
anyway they're kind of like um
i don't know if this is everybody sucks
here i gotta read some replies but i'm
like
i mean i do love that
i mean i hate to be this guy this is
like a huge punch down
but i'm going to do it anyway because i
never learned but like
you know you're married to somebody
you're you're you're in your late 20s
and she's like hey could you give your
parents
the money your parents gave you for your
birthday to help with the household
expenses
and he's like this is outrageous
i get it you know it's you're on a fixed
income and your parents have given you
some money for fun
but like this is part of being an adult
and having some some responsibilities
i told her no anyway
not the [ __ ] your wife inherited
family funds
to acquire the property and has paid the
mortgage with the income from the other
separate property
a demand for you to pay the property
taxes
would in fact constitute a co-mingling
of funds on the condo
and it would become a marital property
that this may be a lawyer i refuse to
argue with them
they said the word co-mingle and marital
property
that makes sense though it definitely
seems like
if you pay the property tax on a house
you are entitled to some equity however
simultaneously all that means i think
is that the wife needs to pay the
property tax but then just
draft a separate arrangement to start
charging rent she needs to get him to
sign a lease
instead of being like hey i need 1400 a
month for property
tax she needs to be like i'll pay the
property tax but rent is 1400
a month
what do you mean i'm the ass i'm just
i'm
i'm just trying to separate the the
legalese here okay
hold on hold on hold on this
hold on hold on i was coming to say
you're the [ __ ] until i saw what
she's asking you to pay
property taxes on my house are 4k a year
so i was thinking on a condo she's
asking you to pay
under 2k a year which would be
reasonable since you don't pay rent 1400
a month for property taxes though is the
condo one mount olympus
otherwise she's trying to get you to pay
your mortgage for a place you have no
legal claim to
and you you're already covering all the
utilities no not the [ __ ]
i mean 1400 a month it stood out to me
too
based on your update sounds like she
forgot about taxes when she did her
budget and now wants you to pick up the
slack
it's also rude to change the agreement
and demand your birthday money
i know it's not fair it's just the
expression birthday money
when when you're talking about somebody
like over the age of
you know 15 is doesn't make it
fun to laugh at but it's just you don't
hear it that much i guess is what i'm
trying to say
um anyway imo couples should have fair
fine
finances not equal finances if you make
a third of what she does you should pay
33
of shared expenses no way in hell you
should be paying more than she is
i well yeah i mean especially because
she's got the equity
not the [ __ ] oh wow okay let me
now we're getting into straight up like
legal situations
all right i think we got we have time
for one more these have been these have
been pretty spicy i wish that wasn't
deleted but
i respect them
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to pay an
artist for her work
the fact that this has come as a not the
[ __ ]
is very intriguing to me
oh this is a long one this
is a long one
oh look at it's like seven edits dude
okay so i know this sounds bad am i the
[ __ ] for refusing to pay an artist
for her work
i know this sounds bad but i genuinely
don't think i'm at fault here so i'm
currently planning to get my apartment
repainted completely since i've just
moved in
and all the walls happen to be white i
was talking to a friend about this when
she told me oh my god did she paint some
messed up stuff on the walls
i i can't wait i was talking to a friend
about this and you told me he had a
friend who had just recently graduated
art school and was really
into wall painting i told him i didn't
want any wall painting done because i
had already planned out most of the
coloring scheme
i get i i need to get to the point here
real quick but
um it's kind of a red flag i think when
some when you're like i'm a painter oh
really like what do you paint
walls
i was expecting it to be like you know
watercolors or something like that
i didn't think walls um
anyway he told me his friend was looking
for places to practice wall painting
because she's new to it
and hasn't really found places she could
do it without it being vandalism so i
called her up we had a chat i said
i don't mind letting you paint the walls
of my bedroom because i'm busy for the
next few days and it isn't a common
living space i checked with my painters
they told me they could easily paint
over that
they're not free for a couple of weeks
so i haven't moved in yet but i told him
to ask his friends to go nuts in my room
without scraping or causing any damage i
told her that her work would be painted
over
she said she's simply doing it for the
practice and wouldn't mind as long as
she could take some pictures for her
portfolio
and that i would be doing her a huge
favor letting her practice
okay um so far this seems like
a prelude to the classic statement no
good deed goes unpunished
you know you gain nothing out of it
she gains a practice studio and then
here's where it all goes wrong
so fast forward a couple weeks i go to
my room it's absolutely amazing
with a bunch of designs and a lot of
edgy art so i decided i wouldn't get it
painted over
problem is i have a contract with my
painter and still have to pay him for my
room even if he doesn't do the job
i called her and told her the room was
great and i'd be recommending her to
anyone who asked who painted my room
she then out of the blue asked me how
much i'd be paying her for the work
i told her about my painter situation
that i would have paid her the amount i
was paying him if i didn't have a
contract she got mad and told me i was
taking advantage of a young artist
she's literally three years younger she
said she'd sue me for payment and i
reminded her of our agreement
she said that was done on the basis i
wouldn't be keeping it i told her i was
doing her a favor by giving her a place
to practice i never had any monetary
obligation
she blew up at me and called our mutual
friend so i exchanged i explained my
situation how i simply don't have the
funds
but he thinks i'm an [ __ ] too so
reddit am i the [ __ ]
do we have to have like a landlord one
followed by like an artist
not getting paid because like i know
that i'm
on the chat side in this genuinely in my
soul
sometimes there are little contextual
details in these stories that make it uh
something that can be argued over it
sounds like
in the story look in principle artists
should be paid for their work
and in practice they should be paid for
their work and probably paid more than
they are
that being said if the arrangement was
set up
you get to have a practice space
and i'm not good because you in some
situations you might even charge for a
practice space
but anyway i digress
and then you you get paid in the ability
to you know hone your craft for however
long
no other finances are exchanging hands
and then you ask for money later that
makes op not the [ __ ]
now
could because i'm like is it king
solomon the one that's like there's two
people that think they're the they claim
to be the mother of the baby
and then uh the one they're like okay
well they split the baby in half
like i don't remember how the story ends
it can't be
anything but a gruesome tale um but i'm
like well
it was under the impression
that it was going to be painted over
so i do think that if the artist is not
going to get paid
they still have the ownership of the art
to the extent that they can force it to
be paid over
or painted over i should say
if if you make something cool with your
art to practice with
and then they decide hey like i want to
keep it in my room now i think you could
be like
give me you know a couple hundred bucks
or i'd really like you to paint over it
because who knows you know like one day
this could be worth well i don't know i
mean it's a it's a ridiculous like
argument to objectivism but you know
that was the
that was the the terms of the agreement
so if you want to adhere to them then we
should adhere to them
you could also just pay it over to
spider i guess
or paint it over i don't know why i keep
saying pay it over
you know i kind of look at it like um
you know she she create she might have
if if you had originally drafted the
agreement
and the agreement was like hey you can
practice
in my room i'll probably paint over it
but if it's good i'll keep it then the
artist might have been like you know
what
in that case if you keep it all i ask is
that you pay me
a couple hundred bucks or whatever if
you paint over it no big deal i'm not
going to charge you but if you decide
that you like it
please give me a tip or something like
that that would that would have solved
this but anyway
um where where the heck was i here edit
i never wanted my room
to be painted by an artist and don't
have the money to get it done
professionally
can i just say this is the reason uh
you just say no to everything
maybe this makes me a [ __ ]
there were times occasionally i'll get
almost like a ridiculous request via
email
um someone will be like hey you know can
you
hop on like a call for 10 minutes we'll
talk about this 10 minutes is nothing
this is what i'm worried about i'm
worried that you're a damn liar
and this quick 10 minute call is gonna
result in an email like 18 months from
now that's like my business
failed thanks to you and now you're
gonna pay
like this this is why you should say no
to almost everything especially if it's
not your idea
no no all good deeds uh no good deeds
remain unpunished
anyway moving on i never wanted my room
to be painted by an artist i don't have
the money to get it done professionally
i thought i'd keep it because it looks
great
and i could recommend it to other people
who saw it about her
edit i did not charge her anything for
letting her use my walls for practice
yes word you know
neither of these make op's case any
stronger i'd say
i didn't commission her to do it i
didn't even give her any guidelines
except not to scrap the walls
this was supposed to be letting her
practice and make a portfolio
i wasn't trying to connor okay so i i
actually have a lot of sympathy for op
because there are people on earth who
have never left
uh the confines of their bedroom
and all of their lived experience comes
second hand from reading things on the
internet
and it's like you end up with these
situations where there's absolutes like
literally you're trying to exploit this
artist and i can understand why
uh she's probably getting way too many
uh
hate comments that being said these are
not looking
these these are not making her look any
better but anyway
i wasn't trying to con her for [ __ ]
sake
i thought it wouldn't hurt me to let her
practice since i was going to be
repainting
anyway i didn't originally plan on
keeping the yard
yeah but you kind of are now
though you can see like you're you're
simply leaving the door
open just enough for for her to have
something to argue with if you're just
like fine i'm painting over then i think
it's okay
then i think nobody would be like you're
the [ __ ] but um
i was thinking of paying her a token
amount whatever i can but now i'm torn
because i think that would actually give
her grounds to sue
she does not have the right to claim
ownership or intellectual property
rights of the art right now i checked
but i don't want to get myself
into more hot water for trying to do a
good thing
the painters were contract there's so
many edits and are being paid for me
reserving their time
at least from what i understand it's too
late to cancel any charges
yeah like i don't know maybe i'm just
cut from a different cloth i'm like why
even post the thread
i'll just paint over it and the painters
are going to be there anyway
turn it into an nft yeah i think i think
you have an ultimatum
i think you can you can pay her and keep
it that's the right thing to do
or you can paint over it and be in the
moral right and not pay her anything
and i think that's it if you want to
keep it
you should at least like you know give
her a little something you don't have to
but you should
i think that o.p is upset that she
thought the artist would be flattered
that she liked her work but instead
is now just the situation where it's
like you know
she's not even she didn't even say thank
you that i want to keep her work
the verdict is not the [ __ ] i do
think that's fair though
can i can i read some of these comments
please
just just give it a moment
what the heck is this is a shooting star
on this comment
so she was happy to use the space for
practice and no pay when she thought
you'd be erasing it and now you're
keeping it she wants compensation
that doesn't make sense to me like you
said you did her the favor of providing
a blank space to work in and since
you're out of pocket for paying the
painters for the room they aren't
painting anymore i'd say not the [ __ ]
she is still getting her portfolio piece
and you'll be advertising
look i don't think is that
bad
i i do agree in principle the thing is
like
not no other like services have
changed hands it's a dif it's it's a
strange thing but it's like
you know if i what here's the situation
okay and
this is the worst analogy but i'm i'm
laughing my ass off thinking about it
imagine you had like two bites of your
sandwich left
right and then you were like hey can you
throw this
in the garbage for me and then you
handed it to someone
and then they ate it instead of throwing
in the garbage
would you be like oh no harm no foul
yes that's what i would do is it
possible that someone would be like
are you gonna pay me 50 cents for those
two bites of sandwich because i was of
the impression that you were gonna throw
it in the garbage
destroying it for both of us but instead
you ate it and thus are receiving some
value from it
even though it fundamentally didn't
change what i thought was going to
happen to the sandwich in the first
place don't you think it's fair that i
get
some compensation for the value that
you've derived from this
i don't know i actually don't know
but it's a funny it could be a good
sketch comedy show
when you think about that oh no
this this right here op
simply tell the artist to make her happy
you'll be repainting the room then
take as much time as you need to decide
what would be even better than the paint
that you have
right now a year to malicious compliance
everyone on reddit is like
being a good person
and like making this situation happy for
everybody if possible
that would be great but you know would
be even greater owning
somebody on a petty technicality keeping
their
art and also not paying them because
they didn't read the fine print on the
contract we didn't sign
first i would wish for more wishes hold
on
hold on my oh my oh my oh my
what happened here how do you collapse
comments on old reddit
click the line to the left to erase you
click on this thing
yo i came here prepared to vote you're
the [ __ ] but after reading i would
say not the [ __ ]
the initial agreement was she can use
your walls for practice and afterwards
use the photos that hasn't changed and
you keep deci
by you deciding to keep the paintings on
the wall oh yes fair enough hey this is
i would think about giving her a tip for
a job well done but that would be
totally voluntary and not part of the
initial agreement
i agree with that i think the op has
done nothing wrong except violating
perhaps an unspoken uh social norm of
you did a nice thing for me and i'm
gonna keep it so you know here's a
little bit of money
similarly the artist should probably not
um
threaten to sue but maybe this is why
contracts exist in the first place
[Laughter]
it's all unspoken rules that are causing
all these problems but



in session we're back on our slash
am i the [ __ ] filtered can i say by
the way thank you people
i i get links probably like a reddit
thread a day now on twitter and
i'm assuming that it's only gonna uh
grow from there
um but i just weekly this is kind of
like a
an unintended consequence i am getting
the absolute worst reddit threads of all
time
linked to me every single day on twitter
which i'm i'm here for it gives me the
people send me like uh like today i got
a reddit link that was just like am i
the
[ __ ] for telling my surrogate to stop
pretending to be my
child's mother and you're like oh my god
that's uh
i mean it's just it gives you some some
entertaining morning reading let's put
it that way
um but we're back with uh am i the
[ __ ] filtered
and i gotta tell you i'm just i'm doing
a quick perusal
and i see that we have an awful lot of
uh [ __ ] here not my words those are
the words of the
uh these are the words of the
the people of the plebiscite that have
has taken place
am i the [ __ ] for kicking my
mother-in-law out of family dinner after
she said my lasagna tastes like freezer
lasagna
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to turn
off kanye west after my girlfriend's
friend requested i do
excited okay how about this
am i the [ __ ] for telling my daughter
that if she won't stand up for herself
i don't want to hear about it your
daughter okay
um well look i'm going to tell you
sometimes you just gloss over some of
this stuff in the headline and you think
to yourself like oh well let's
hear it out look i'm i'm only the father
to a 10 month old daughter she doesn't
get into these kind of problems
right off the bat um at least i hope not
but simultaneously
it's a good start am i the [ __ ] for
telling my daughter if she won't stand
up for herself
i don't want to hear about it i divorced
my wife almost 20 years ago because her
work
work life became so severely toxic to my
mental health i was developing extreme
anger management issues
what a [ __ ] how
just immediately i divorced my wife 20
years ago
it i developed anger management issues
but it wasn't my fault
at all i had no agency her work life
became so toxic
it just made me so mad
to keep it short it didn't matter who it
was she would not stand up for herself
at work so day after day she's telling
me these work stories about how upset
she was i'd give her suggestions and
nothing would change
things escalated and slowly but surely
i'm building a resentment i didn't know
was there and found myself angry anytime
she would talk about work
she refused to get therapy or do
anything to improve her situation our
marriage slowly fell apart because of it
it wasn't until i decided to get therapy
myself because i couldn't control my
anger that i realized the relationship
itself had become toxic for me it took a
lot longer after that but we ultimately
divorced as a result
okay i have to say right off the bat
phase one paragraph one
at least he's acknowledging that he has
some issues
but the fact that he you know despite
the fact that he had been married he
didn't pick up on like one of the number
one
keys for uh maintaining a human
relationship which is sometimes people
just want to vent
and they don't want to um have their
vents where they get their stress out
be met with like well why didn't you
just take one simple solution
uh and do it you know sometimes you just
got because it
may be the reason and i'm getting too
into this early but maybe the reason she
didn't want to stand up for herself at
work is because
i as much as this sounds uh you know
maybe like a little passive
some things that make you annoyed at
work aren't worth getting into
like a confrontation over uh especially
as it might affect your your
future employment status like sometimes
your
[ __ ] rolls downhill in a in an
environment like that and you just gotta
be like i'm annoyed as hell
but i'm just gonna go home and vent to
my spouse because that's like one of the
roles they have when you talk about the
you know when you exchange vows for
richer or poorer
do you vow to listen even though
sometimes a solution will pop into your
head that seems like it could fix the
entire issue
do you pledge to recognize that they
probably thought about that
solution and then thought about you know
here's the reasons i don't want to do it
so help me god amen i don't think you
say amen in the vows i don't remember
anyway
fast forward to present day and my adult
daughter is now working in the federal
government and she's letting the same
thing happen to her
we talk on the phone every other day and
the past three phone calls she's
complained about the same situation
i've given her well the only thing i
could say at this you think at any point
in this
guy's uh treatise he's like maybe it's
genetic
there's the the the complaining gene it
couldn't be that like literally
everybody complains about their job it
it has to be
um it's just a habit that's been passed
down
we talk on the phone every other day
i've given her suggestions and nothing
has changed i immediately recognized my
anger building so i stopped her last
night and told her if she can't stand up
for herself i don't want to hear about
it
she called me an [ __ ] and hung up on
me this morning my son called
to ask why my sister's telling everyone
an [ __ ] to hear my side
so i told him the abridged version and
he told me i'm an [ __ ] as well
well can i say something here again
we're assuming these posts are real if
your daughter
and son both tell you you're the [ __ ]
you don't have to go to reddit because
even if reddit tells you you're not the
[ __ ]
what are you going to do are you you're
going to like link them
in your it's going to be all caps
forward re
forward forward you won't believe this
you know whatever whatever your kids
think
is unfortunately your reality anyway
i may have been a little tactless in how
i shut down the conversation but i can't
invite that anger into my life again i
look men i'm glad we're talking
about anger
our emotions he got therapy you know so
on and so forth
but aren't you you got an adult
daughter who's working for the federal
government that means you got to be like
in your mid
40s or older like
can't you just deal with it i know how
this sounds but like
can you can you just you know push that
down and have like one too many
yinglings on the weekend like a normal
person like i just don't understand
they're your kids this is what they're
there for this is i mean they're not
just to complain but at the same time i
think you got to take some
responsibility for your
for your awareness here or for your for
your own well-being i guess you are but
not in a healthy way oh here we go i
love when an edit comes in and the
person has clearly missed the reason
that people think that they're an
[ __ ] and they're they're being a
little bit judgmental
and instead they're like hey maybe i
wasn't specific enough about this
ancillary detail that i talked about in
the first paragraph
here's some instances of me standing up
with my wife she'd be in a team of five
but because she was very efficient her
team lead super manager would keep
putting more work on her
even when she had more work that she
could do she would never say no at one
time she was on seven projects and
everybody else and her team was on one
she just wouldn't say i can't i'm
swamped y'all fanta pull
thanks for the gifties thank you i can't
i'm swamped i would literally suggest
you say something like i'm already on
seven projects i don't have time i know
x is only on one project right now have
you asked them
that's a great way to get ahead in the
corporate uh politics game
[Laughter]
hey thanks for giving me more work but
uh jessica's not very busy right now
maybe jessica could do it
that's a good way to get uninvited to
the potluck um
she would complain and stress out and
have breakdowns before the week started
because of work anxiety but she still
wouldn't say no
after years of seeing this happen to my
wife but her never doing anything to
change in order to try to improve
herself so she'd have the confidence
the anger i was feeling at her workplace
was carrying over to her i couldn't
stomach hearing about her work anymore
without immediately becoming angry but i
kept bottling it up until i couldn't
anymore now my daughter is letting the
same thing happen to her
so i just keep hearing about just
hearing about it is immediately putting
me back in that place again
and the anger i used to feel is coming
up with my daughter this
is uh i'm a little surprised to see that
i mean
this is the oh literally i can't even
scroll further anyway i'll just tell you
it's uh you're the [ __ ] 43
not the [ __ ] 39
which is a little surprising uh for me
but i do know that's the reddit
demographic as well
um i think there there might be a lot of
let's say
younger people who are like well if she
didn't want a solution to the problem
she shouldn't have been
knocking about it in the first place you
know um
and by the way i so often hear this as
like uh
uh like oh women don't want a solution
to their problem they just want to
complain
whereas men are like hardwired to be uh
like solutions providers and i'm like i
think i bought into that like kool-aid
when i was in the
when i was in my early 20s but now i'm
like dude i just love to complain all
the time
sometimes i'll just go into the discord
and i'll complain
about like a stranger i saw i'll be like
you won't believe this [ __ ] that i
heard
that i saw at the grocery store
yesterday people don't go like oh you
know
they should go up and tell them to
modify their behavior do they just drop
middle finger emojis and say give them
one of those next time and i'm like hell
yeah
[Laughter]
complaining's just it's it's it's part
of the the human
nature you know anyway i would say
before we look at the update
absolutely um absolutely the [ __ ]
look i think you got to separate the
concerns here right
is it okay to not love
hearing someone complain about something
that seems easily fixable
yeah and if it was like someone that's a
little bit further outside of like your
sphere
of influence then you know you'd be like
hey
i you know if you're just gonna
constantly complain about this stuff you
ever thought about adjusting your
behavior then
you know you could say that maybe to a
friend or to a uh
an acquaintance and get away with it um
but to a spouse
that's really like that's part of the
foundational duties i think which is
like
i mean again i made a joke about how
it's part of the vows but like
much of the communication that happens
between spouses is probably just like
bitching about stuff that happened at
work that day
you get it out i get it out and then
it's okay what do you want for dinner
two hours later we decided we eat then
we go to bed like that's that's
basically what it's all about so if
you're
if you're not up for that
that doesn't make them the [ __ ] it it
it does mean that you you know maybe you
did the right thing by getting divorced
but i think he's also realizing that
uh you know literally everybody does
this like i don't believe it's uh
this is like a just a mother and
daughter situation i think
pretty much everybody that he talks to
in his life must [ __ ] about work now
and then but simultaneously everybody
else he can just like walk away from
so yeah i think i i think it does make
him the [ __ ] i mean
i hate to be like you know that as the
husband or father your role is just to
lay down and go like uh-huh uh-huh yeah
okay
wow she sucks wow that's crazy but like
yeah pretty much you kind of gotta and
you recognize that
they do it for you as well or maybe like
if they don't do it for you
you should start venting a little bit
more usu when you have a bad day at work
instead of just shoving it down inside
you should start going off
anyway that's so i i think yeah
kind of the [ __ ] let's look at this
link to update
oh lord every time
[Laughter]
i wanted to lead by clearing up a few
things
my wife and i were married for seven
years before my anger issues manifested
i was her emotional support for even
longer she introduced me to some
solutions and support we had our own
rules on our daily walks i just listened
if she spoke about work at home and
meant we could discuss it normal
just a very normal uh
sort of arrangement to have with your
spouse
uh excuse on our walks you can complain
that's the safe spot for complaining
when we're within the confines of the
home any complaining is met with a
solutions based response
i did tell her she needs to get help but
that was at the end of our relationship
she refused couples therapy personal
therapy and insisted it was my
responsibility to be there for her okay
well
let me just say that does make her kind
of the [ __ ] if we take this is true
you know the you you refusing to uh be
involved
or her refusing to be involved in
therapy makes her kind of the [ __ ]
sure okay simultaneous i i do
also need to say like so much of the the
post
is like about the relationship with the
ex-wife
and the original post is am i the
[ __ ] for telling my daughter to shut
up
basically so like the whole relationship
with your ex-wife is just
background context like like let's get
to the part where you're like
oh and my daughter you know i was hungry
in the conversation anyway
um ultimately i had to walk away from
the marriage
my daughter is nearing 30 years old she
is not a child
and i'm happy to say we have a great
relationship her regular call should be
proof of that
she did call me an [ __ ] though for
those wondering why my anger is
hard to control here's here's why it's
different for me than other people
prior i never really got angry i was
raised with a belief that if something
happens it's happened you got no control
over it so don't let it bother you
i never had much of an experience with
anger because of this when i started to
feel it i just bottled everything i
ignorantly believed that i had control
update i had a zoom call with my
children
i started by apologizing to my daughter
okay acceptable
i've never spoken to either of them
about why their mother and i divorced so
i explained it to them
uh as minimally as i could i confessed
my mental health struggles with anger i
made it clear it wasn't her fault now
they have the whole picture
again it's just like i
react's cord wouldn't exist if this were
the case but yeah this is like
i mean it's just it just scares me that
like a
a father to a 30 year old
uh woman
is like before i thought to apologize
i just ran it by reddit first to make
sure i wasn't gonna
you know beta myself or something like
that but anyway
the conversation went well i answered
their questions as best as i could i
reassured my daughter she can always
speak to me and she can
vent to me little sauce but that's okay
she asked if it would help if she let me
know ahead of time that she wants to
vent about work and it was embarrassing
but i asked if she could we agreed that
she'll text me bad work day and if i'm
able to i'll call her
my son didn't have much to say but he
did tell his sister she can call him to
vent too
okay that you know if it works it works
um but again
i don't know maybe i'm idealizing this
situation where i'm like i think if
you're the dad you kind of gotta
you know sorry i mean i look it's
good probable mental health like
quarantining
but i do when i look to myself as being
like a you know if i'm
uh like 60 and and my daughter's in her
30s or getting to be in her 30s
and she texts me like bad work day and
i'm like sorry i'm not in the right
headspace to help you out right now
i'm like you know i kind of feel like
that it's
if you got to do it for self-care you
got to do it for self-care
but at the same time i'm like you know
this is kind of your role as the father
i guess but anyway um
whatever if it works for them it works
for them you know different stuff for
different people
um what you got to do you got to find
your daughter a spouse i think that's
that's my
[ __ ] solution to this um which is
that
i think you need to this is like an
unethical life pro tip
you need to find your daughter a spouse
that can receive the venting instead of
you
because it sounds like he wants to live
in a world where nobody else
ever talks about their problems so i
think at this point you gotta
start being the matchmaker for your
daughter you gotta be like
you know hey i've gotta have lined up a
series of great listeners
pick one
[Laughter]
but then what if she has to vent about
her husband no that's i think that's a
sibling thing i think that's then she
texts the brother and says bad
marriage day anyway um not much else to
say thank you to everyone for your
kindness and time for everyone who is
hostile with me i hope you find your own
peace i love that man
look he was he seems like he came to
the end of being a nice guy but i love
that he he was kind of like an
[ __ ] in the first post but then in
the at the end of the second one he's
like
i hope you find a way to get rid of your
anger someday
anyway still that's a good ending you
know
again it might not be the way that i
would ideally solve this problem but uh
if they were able to to come to a
solution like as a result of their
as a result of that then then who am i
to judge right who am i to say that
that's not okay
just giving my two cents and trying to
make it entertaining as well it seems
like a little bit of a happy ending
verdict op original post
kind of the [ __ ] update
recognize that the best way to solve
this stuff is probably to just have a
conversation with the person
who got offended rather than read it and
then you know there you go
am i the [ __ ] for telling my sister
she's a failure as a parent
oh no because her son is in a
relationship
with a cartoon character pillow
just take a little sip real quick am i
the [ __ ] for telling my sister
she's a failure as a parent because her
son is in a relationship with a cartoon
character pillow
chad's asking the right question what
what character is it
good day y'all
my 18 year old nephew is in a
relationship with a body-sized pillow
with some sort of japanese girl cartoon
character on it
yes a relationship like that's his
girlfriend with a
freaking cartoon character he proudly
walks around with the pillow and talks
to it
i asked my sister what the frick is
going on and she called me a bigot for
not supporting this
i told her she failed as a mother and
that he needs to be straightened out if
he's mentally ill
he needs to seek professional help
otherwise someone needs to set him
straight because this is pathetic
um this it might be fake yeah or like
definitely is fake but again we always
assume that it's real
i i do love the the second paragraph
there's two options
he either needs therapy from an
accredited mental health professional
if he won't do that someone's gotta set
him straight
someone someone's gotta sit him down you
know what they gotta do they gotta make
him
be in a relationship with like an entire
crate like a shipping container
full of body pillows like when your dad
catches you smoking a cigarette when
you're 12 and he makes you smoke a whole
pack on the porch with him
you you got to be in a relationship with
every single body pillow until you get
it out of your system
anyway the whole family's against me i
don't hate this kid he needs help but i
can't understand why i'm the oddly one
who thinks
there is a problem here um
there's not a lot to go on here but i
will say you're the [ __ ] 48
not the [ __ ] 35 that's what we got
everybody sucks here 14
i'm the oddly one
again i i think it's important and i'm
not sure if everybody does this
you know when they look at these posts
but for me i think it's important to
like
separate perhaps the way that you feel
about an issue
like you know your nephew being in a
relationship with a body pillow
versus the actual response that was had
you know what i mean so i think some
people would read this and be like
you know if your nephew's in a
relationship with a pillow and genuinely
thinks the pillow's his girlfriend
that's pretty cringe and as a result you
cannot be an [ __ ] regardless of the
actions you took
whereas i'm like look i'm
if if my niece or my nephew brought a
body pillow
out and was like this is my girlfriend
i would have to think long and hard
about how many anecdotes i was going to
reveal to the public on that one
because it would be a once
in a lifetime story like that's like a
career-making
story to introduce into the lore but
simultaneously
maybe a little bit over the line to
sacrifice your nephew for content
i probably wouldn't okay but i in the
back channel i would be like
you know hey is everything okay that
being said
um that doesn't mean you can like
could you talk to the nephew maybe or
even have like a sit-down conversation
with your sister
you know you can't just go hey you've
failed as a mother um as a result of
this
like that's like why is it always like
it goes nuclear
immediately it's never like an
escalation
it's always like i don't like the mashed
potatoes well how about you [ __ ]
die like it always goes
straight to infinity like either they're
missing context or
or like these people are already like on
the razor's edge
of of being livid at all times
um regardless yeah yeah i mean you're
the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] for telling your
sister you're a failure as a parent
because your son is in her
because her son is in a relationship
with a cartoon character pillow do not
take that to mean that i'm saying
get out there to bed bath and beyond and
and start playing the you know there's
plenty of fish in the sea
in the upholstery section rather it's
more like
you don't get to have cool uh you know
good boy credits
for being like hey that situation's like
a little bit [ __ ] up
i'm not gonna do anything to solve it
but have you ever noticed like
you you haven't actually done anything
you're like leonard nimoy in the
monorail episode of the simpsons like
yeah you've recognized it's unusual and
you're like hey
fix it and then they're like i don't
think that anything's wrong and you're
like well
you failed as a mother anyway yeah plus
you never
you never told us uh which character and
that's important
as you have never told us which
character how am i supposed to judge
here
i don't know any characters from anime
um
um major kusanagi was it major kusanagi
was it hank hill
all right take me back oh now we finally
got to a good one here okay
not that the other ones didn't have a
little bit of meat but
oh man am i the [ __ ] for
refusing to turn off kanye west after my
girlfriend's friend requested that i do
this is sort of a petty squabble
[Laughter]
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to turn
off kanye west after my girlfriend's
friend requested that i do
i this is sort of a petty squabble i had
but my girlfriend told me after i was
being unreasonable and i can see why
she said so but i still made the post
nonetheless for entertainment i
appreciate it for the content easy clap
upstairs champion for posting this for
content yesterday my girlfriend her
friend and i were all going somewhere so
i picked her and her friend up while in
the car i began to play some kanye west
and rapping along with the lyrics
after a couple minutes my girlfriend's
friend requested i turned them
by the way can i say um
a little cringe this is just my two
cents
to like if you're in the car by yourself
do whatever you want
if you're in the call with like uh you
know
your your partner close friend whatever
you could do whatever you want i mean
you could literally do whatever you want
at any time i guess but
um this crosses the social norm
for sure uh regardless after a couple of
minutes my girlfriend's friend requested
i turn the music off because she finds
kanye misogynistic and annoying
i refuse because it's my car and i'm
entitled to play what i want so i
continued to play him
after we dropped her off my girlfriend
told me i was being unreasonable and
should have just turned them off to
avoid any arguments
i can see her pov but at the same time
it's my car
and i can do what i want again and then
the edit of course the
the edit is always like i was playing
the album 808
and heartbreak paranoid robocop
heartless street lights for those of you
who aren't familiar with kanye's
discography it has no curse words and is
an album
about his breakup it's like it
does it does it change your opinion that
i ignored her request
if you know it's 808s and heartbreaks
does that does that give you the kind of
context that makes me come across
in a better light okay we got 58
you're the [ __ ] 35 not the [ __ ]
i mean here's the thing there are
unspoken rules in a car
you know like let's talk about it if
someone calls shotgun you respect it
there is a rule that overrides shotgun
if
the uh boyfriend or girlfriend of the
driver
is around the rules of shotgun do not
apply any longer
the the romantic partner always gets
uh the front seat next to the driver the
driver
gets the right of first refusal on the
music
now there there's probably some city you
know if you got a little kid in the car
maybe you don't want to be listening to
like hardcore gangster rap or something
like that
but the driver gets to choose the music
or
the right to pass the music on to
another person
hey can you pick the songs the person
in the passenger seat is always in
charge
of the navigation so like it used to be
they'd have to plan a route out or get a
map or something like that or pay
attention to what the exit was going to
be
now it's hey you program the gps or like
look it up in google map on your phone
and then basically like everybody else
is just don't
the the the driver is in control if the
driver says you can't eat then you can't
eat in the car okay
within reason they don't want crumbs in
their car they don't want filet-o-fish
sandwich wrappers all over the floor
then so be it
if they say you know go to town i even
put some like potato chips in the back
then you go for it you know it's
it's simple everyone else is there yeah
do you keep the driver awake entertain
don't distract etc say yeah don't don't
get into fist fights
don't start throwing stuff everybody
there's one other unspoken rule which is
when the gps talks
everybody is silent until the driver
says
you can talk again and that's it i think
that's pretty that's that's it
not oh when when you've been driving for
like an hour and there's like three
exits on the highway coming up close
and then you're like in 600
meters take exit and then people are
like
and you're like shut up i gotta know
is it is it exit 118a or 118b right
okay so anyway now that we've gone
through that let me uh let me hydrate
um definitely there's 808s there's no
swearing in 808s
why why are you in the op of the opinion
that you can't be offensive without
swear words
some of the most offensive [ __ ] i've
ever seen has been
like g-rated
maybe dan posted it dan are you the op
here
[Laughter]
i'm just saying look again you have to
separate
the issue from the behavior okay
is the issue reasonable i think when
you're in the car
you know if you don't like the music
that's being played
my two cents is that you get over it
right
you know how many times i've in high
school especially at drive with mouth he
puts on like some
some trivium or some in flames or
something like that i got no
like i i derived no value from it i have
no idea
what's being said because it's it's
growling and i haven't learned that
diction yet what do i do oh can we put
on some broken social scene or something
like that i'm like nah it's his car
i'm happy to get a drive in the 1994
volvo station wagon that
was was older than i was at that point
and it was uh
you know it was his uh generosity to
drive me home in the first place
that being said i also think
if you're the driver you got to worry
about other people's concerns you know
if if i was driving a car i consider
myself like the general manager
of like a cool nightclub on wheels and
if a customer came
up to me and was like hey the music
that's being played is uh
making it a little bit inhospitable in
here for me i would be like you know
what thank you so much for your comment
let's put on you know the carpenters or
something like that
seems like there's a compromise where
you could have found
something that was not kanye west but
that you both enjoyed
is i guess what i'm saying um
regardless i was i would say i mean this
one's weird for me i don't think that op
had to
you know bring the nuclear hammer down
and i think that you know it is their
car
my my unspoken rule is you know the
driver gets the right
of first refusal on the music um
that being said i do have to say
it kind of is his car his rules i don't
know if you thought i was going to end
up on this side of this but
i i don't know if this is even and
everybody sucks here i almost feel like
this is uh
like he's the [ __ ] but also he's
right
[Laughter]
i i think he's dumb maybe because he
probably
if he had just changed the music he
might have saved himself an argument and
all it takes is a couple of electrical
impulses but
um i also feel like it probably
uh lowered your standing in the eyes of
your girlfriend's friend which is kind
of like uh
you know maybe you care maybe you don't
but it's not gonna make your life any
easier let's put it that way
uh i i would have just changed the music
but i could understand why he wouldn't
have
this is an interest there's a there's
actually a lot of meat for discussion on
this
plus i hope that we at least people jeed
some rules about being in the car
i mean there's only a couple of like
rules in the car that are like
sacrosanct right is that is that how
that word works
if they keep their car very clean and
you open up like a bag of potato chips
or something like that like that's where
you
start to run into some issues i think
that's where you're like
you don't compromise that one at all
because i don't want to have to go get
the
dyson down here and you know vacuum the
bugatti all-weather floor mats out just
because you ate some hickory sticks like
just pull over and eat them in the woods
like god intended
anyway
i don't even mind eating in the car the
here's and again there's
it's a complicated web of rules right
but like
if you're gonna eat in the car my rule
is you have to give me some
i don't care if you're starving if
you're eating in the back seat
you you better like i mean if you got a
10 piece i'd expect one nook
or at least like a little like grab of
fries you know what i mean like a little
duck
a little duck grab of french fries
if you got a six piece i'm not gonna
take a whole nugget that's a little
crazy but
you know i might be like hey if we go
through the drive-through like can you
give me a drink or something like that
anyway
[Laughter]
it's very complicated this is why i i
think it's why i'm so hungry all the
time my brain's constantly running
simulations on
on the proper way to behave you know
with social norms and etiquette
and context and you know this exact
situation having extra concessions
am i the [ __ ] for leaving a diner a
one-star oh a
i thought it was a human being and i was
like oh my god somebody
actually made my website a reality
where the restaurant owners can rate the
customers i was so happy
uh but then when i read more okay it's a
it's a diner like a restaurant
all right
am i the [ __ ] for leaving a diner a
one-star review by the way i'm sure then
i don't know i i might have missed the
raid thank you
perfect timing for the kanye west op
as well am i the [ __ ] for leaving a
diner a one-star review for refusing to
accommodate me and remake my food
yesterday i took my son out to eat for
lunch we decided to try a cute
family-owned diner that had pretty good
reviews
i have some severe potentially
life-threatening food allergies all
right let's
just not the [ __ ] and the only reason
i i think actually you know what they
might be an [ __ ]
just for making the post
when you know immediately you're not
gonna come across as the [ __ ]
if it was like i don't like peanuts then
that's like okay maybe
you were a bad customer if you're like
if i eat them i die
um then yeah okay like you already have
the moral high ground let's let's see
where it goes
i have some severe potentially
life-threatening food allergies so i
usually try to play a safe
and order something i know does not have
anything that could kill me in it
i ordered a toasted gluten-free grilled
chicken breast wrap
with lettuce onions and green peppers
those were the listed ingredients and
that seems safe
it's not something i would order but i
also
don't have life-threatening gluten
intolerance okay
i'm not judging you based on your
restaurant order that's something we
saved for the banter in other contexts
on a roll yes sir yo let me get a
toasted gluten-free chicken breast wrap
with lettuce onions green peppers on a
roll yes sir
can't forget the bev you know i gotta
cop that tap water
that lukewarm tap water yes sir
when i got my food i noticed something
red in it and picked it out with my fork
it was a tomato which i am highly
allergic to
there was tomatoes all through my food
so i was unable to eat it
okay i quietly motioned
for someone to come over and explain the
situation and they called for the owner
to listen to me
the owner said they'd remake my food but
they'd have to charge me again for the
time and ingredients even though i could
not eat what i was given
this is what i this is the labor crunch
in the united states right now
margins have been pushed so thin they
can't even remake a
toasted gluten-free grilled chicken
breast wrap with
chicken breast wrap with lettuce onions
and green peppers on a roll yes sir
hard not the [ __ ] though i will say
if we're taking them at face value
and their menu literally said it just
has lettuce onions green peppers and
then it comes out with a tomato
if someone's allergic to tomato
you should remake it for free
if it said tomato on the menu
they missed it and said oh sorry i
missed it
i still think you should
make it for free but also that they
should
offer to pay for it and then you know
i don't you know it's just whether you
want to be a
the the a benevolent restaurant owner
whether you want to like nickel and dime
somebody
i understand either way anyway i pointed
out that nowhere were tomatoes listed in
any part of the dish
i ordered and if they were in a wrap
they should be listed especially if
someone has an allergy
the owner said they don't put everything
up on the board and it's not a big deal
okay now like this is getting
complicated
i thought it was a menu okay
like a printed menu but if it's on a a
text board you know like one of those
like i don't even know how to describe
them like the plastic snap letters go on
to it
or a chalkboard i can understand why
they wouldn't be able to write out every
single ingredient that's
that's gonna be on it i would also now
i'm but
now i'm like you know what i also feel
like the restaurant owner is still kind
of the [ __ ] i don't know if this is
just a recent thing or if it's a
vancouver thing but even if i'm like at
a if i'm in
any kind of sit-down restaurant the wade
staff
always ask hey any food allergies that i
gotta know about
it's like one of the first things that
comes up all the time
you you order something and then they go
you know hey any food allergies
and then you leave that up to the the
diner to pass it on but i don't know
you've never been asked that it had it
happens here
i would say at like at least
70 percent of of meals where i've sat
down
absolutely never heard it in the us
that's crazy man
i mean it makes i i will say it didn't
happen uh
you know like until i moved here so i
don't know if it's a regional thing
or if it's only started happening you
know within the past decade or so i
probably was not asked for the first
time until i was like you know 20 but
anyway um and when
when you get asked it you're like i'm
surprised i i'm let me rephrase i'm not
surprised
i'm surprised it is a more common place
to be asked because
you know i'm sure the odds of it are
pretty low but
you don't want to feed somebody like
chicken satay with a peanut sauce and
then they eat it and die
and they're like were there peanuts in
that
like people are very dumb
i think like it might be the
responsibility of the diner don't get me
wrong to make sure they don't eat
something that's life-threatening but
simultaneously i'm like you know
it's uh people do things that are in
their you know
self not their self interest all the
time anyway um owners said they don't
put everything up on the board it's not
a big deal and for me to either pay to
have my food remade or i can choose not
to eat but i will not be receiving a
second meal for free
owner kind of the [ __ ] i ended up
reordering my meal to my specifications
it took 30 minutes to come out when
before it was less than 10 and was
obviously burned i ate what i could and
threw the rest away before leaving
i think this is a situation where you
got to establish um
that's you know for your son
you need to not eat at that restaurant
if that makes sense
sometimes as a dad i think and i i'm i
have the luxury of not having been put
in this position yet um but sometimes as
a dad i think you need to go hungry in
order to teach your child a lesson
in like not in a negative way but to be
like i would rather
be hungry than give that business that i
hate any more money
that's my take on that subject the fact
that he maybe he was starving and he
ordered again
but i think sometimes you gotta you
gotta do a hunger strike like chris
cornell and be like nah
actually i'm [ __ ] full actually i'm
stuffed i would not like another
you know what you could do is you could
just bring me the bill please
and then that's where then they go oh
and then everyone claps and they give
you a crisp 100
bill or something um and when you get
home yeah you could just steal bread
from the mouths of decadence
um anyway i was really disappointed in
the whole experience ended up
writing a one star review blasting the
place for how i felt they treated me am
i the [ __ ]
again the the context has absolutely no
merit whatsoever
this is a type of wrap i had ordered in
many places before and it does not
typically come with tomatoes it would be
the equivalent of getting a philly
cheesesteak with tomatoes basically
ah yes any time i go to a restaurant i
always scan the menu for my favorite
wrap a gluten-free toasted grilled
chicken breast wrap with lettuce onions
and green peppers
lettuce onions green peppers it's called
the gluten-free toasted chicken breast
log wrap
class it's usually near the top because
every place has it
um and it never has tomatoes a wrap with
tomatoes in it are you stupid
anyway op is not the [ __ ] obviously
but literally like this whole post is
like i was treated like [ __ ] at a
restaurant
uh so i gave them a bad review
on a food review website which is the
purpose of the food review website am i
an [ __ ]
no like literally not at all um
seeking some attention and validation
for the story or maybe there's an upvote
farm
you never know um
if this story is real i feel like the
restaurant owner
kind of an [ __ ] you know what you
know it's been
uh nice sometimes you you go like
pick up takeout from a restaurant they
have this like qr code
menu outside this is i'm i'm all about
this now
you you scan the qr code with your phone
it gives you a menu on your phone so you
don't have to worry about this limited
chalkboard space
and stuff like that you can even like
you you can scan order whatever you want
you can pay you don't even have to like
deal with a human being
all it does is like point to a website
anyway
i'm a big fan of that regardless um
i mean this i've inserted my own
anecdote now
also makes the menu translatable there
you go the diner is the [ __ ] for not
doing the qr code menu
this is a big one for human beings you
know how long for for like a decade
i was talking about how the worst part
of eating at a restaurant
is waiting for the when you're done your
food the server comes over
and then they go you want anything else
and then you go i'll just take the bill
please then you gotta wait for them to
bring the bill
and then sometimes you look at the bill
but they've already left
and then they come back like in five
minutes and you're like i
oh sorry i need the machine and then
they go get the machine like it
sometimes takes like 10 or 15 minutes to
leave the restaurant when you're done
your food
now you just on your phone you just scan
the qr code
you go pay and then you're
you're good you can just walk out and
you feel like a damn gangster the whole
time but
anyway slash marker i was talking about
it for years
i'm not gonna say that the pandemic
accomplished anything good but
the expediting of the restaurant process
if it becomes normalized
i i will at least be a fan of that
okay slash marker react court
one in the books



okay
we got a little bit more going here
still many more things am i the [ __ ]
for kicking my mother-in-law
out of family dinner after she said my
lasagna tasted like freezer lasagna
yes absolutely um don't even need to
read it
any any time you uh kick
your spouse's mom out of family dinner
uh you're you're
really you're on an uphill battle to
have the moral high ground
like they could they could pull down
their pants take a crap on the carpet
they could you know insult your kid or
something like that
but even just insulting the food it's
it's tough to tell them to get out i
guess
anyway let's it's early it's early let's
let's see
i just i see so many words right off the
bat giggled shrieking
mother-in-law is a fairly typical
passive aggressive mother-in-law
tell me you hate uh women without
telling me you hate women
she's a fairly typical passive
aggressive mother-in-law
you know how they are nice to my face
but the food is only ever fine she
purses her lips and my parenting
she plays favorites with her sons
okay i get it i get i'm sorry i come
from an only i'm an only child
sometimes when people start talking
about uncle mother-in-law
sons i start to have to do the family
math in my like i still don't even
really know what a cousin is
like i have to i have to think about
what a cousin is from time to time but
anyway
yeah by the way i love uh sorting
through uh
dozens of spreadsheets to find the data
i need for my presentation
said no happy project manager ever see
why
a 125 000 companies
rely on monday's five-star platform to
orchestrate their team's workflows
show me show me
never never heard of it i am also not a
project manager but
more power to you okay
my food is only ever fine but everything
as my sister-in-law cooks is heaven sent
sister-in-law married the favored son
and gives mother-in-law
unlimited access to the grandkids
this is spicy we had a big family dinner
the other night and my husband brought
up
how she is about my food he said it in
the kitchen out of earshot of
mother-in-law brother-in-law decided to
do a test and had father-in-law
her ex cover her eyes and asked her to
try something
first of all there was literally 10
minutes of back and forth about her
being convinced it was a cockroach so by
the time she got it into her mouth
it was probably cold so the
mother-in-law
she thought that her family was gonna be
like
hey close your eyes we're gonna feed you
a cockroach
i wouldn't cross my mind whatsoever but
um
anyway uh then there was some shrieking
because they were laughing so she was
convinced they did something to her
then more shrieking because she wanted
her eyes uncovered so father-in-law
finally let her go and said it was fine
she said it was fine it tasted like
frozen lasagna
brother-in-law shrugged and said sorry i
guess she doesn't like your cooking
mother-in-law asked if i cooked it
giggled and said they shouldn't have put
her on the spot
everyone was laughing and i was just
over it i said that was what i cooked
for dinner if she didn't like it she
could leave
mother-in-law said it was fine and her
new husband tried to make a joke that it
was better than cockroaches
but that did not go over well
oh that's that's me at the family
gathering when things get awkward too
i'll be like hey at least it's better
than cockroaches and everyone
shoots you a look like shut the [ __ ] up
this goes deep man
this is resentment that started building
before you were even a
a twinkle in this family we didn't even
know who the hell you were when the
roots for this one started to take hold
i said she should leave and she acted
all confused mother-in-law left with her
husband
and brother-in-law and sister-in-law
went after them father-in-law defended
her and said i was being too sensitive
but my husband took my side
finally it doesn't happen that often
53 minutes of uh react court
we have the first sane husband
[Laughter]
who i have to imagine in his head was
probably like this is all very silly but
i know my role
um she said
he said she can't come back until she
apologized
now sister-in-law and brother-in-law are
saying i set her up i'm a cry baby and i
just wanted a reason to kick her out
it's just like so many steps
uh to be to get mad you know like it's
such an elaborate kind of rube goldberg
machine
to make yourself upset i i
almost don't even understand okay so
your mother-in-law you have a
conspiracy theory that
she dislikes your food because you
married not
the favored son whereas the eldest
son his wife always gets all the credit
for cooking
let's talk it that could be real can i
also say though that it's possible that
her sister-in-law is just either a
better cook
or alternatively cooks food that's more
to the liking of a
you know middle-aged american woman
which could happen sure you know i'm
assuming it's american
because it's insane
okay so you have a scientific hypothesis
um you set up a test so far this is
relatively okay scientific uh method
right
um you say let's feed her this lasagna
because my base case is that i know that
this [ __ ]
fire and we're gonna cover her eyes and
then when she eats it she'll give her
honest opinion
if she says it's good which 100
is what's gonna happen that's where she
deviated from the scientific method your
null hypothesis is supposed to be uh
deniability i think most of the time but
anyway
um if she says it's good then i'll be
like
um gotcha and then
all this will be water under the bridge
surely there will be no other
implications
if she says it sucks then i'll get mad
and kick her out of my house
says it sucks you got mad and kicked her
out of the house i'm like
i mean i definitely think that op
is uh is kind of an [ __ ] in this
situation
i can also understand you know why
uh she would be upset don't get me wrong
um maybe this is like a
maybe this is an entitled thing to say
or maybe this is just ego driven
when i i trust my own palate to some
extent you know i know what i like
when i eat something that i cooked and
it's delicious
i'm like it's delicious if somebody was
like yeah it's okay
i'd be like oh sorry my bad but in my
head i'd be like your pal it [ __ ]
blows lady
this [ __ ] is [ __ ] is fire
are you kidding me this is delicious i
get though that you know you're in a big
family situation there's some
jockeying for position you know it's
uh you you watch too much succession
you're trying to figure out where you
are in the family dynamic are you more
of like a cousin ed or are you the
heir apparent so like i i get that part
of it but i'm just like
it seems like a lot of overreacting for
something that's so small
if it does sound sorry cousin greg not
cousin ed my mistake
i've only seen a few episodes um
i will also say it is uh 41
you're the [ __ ] 34 not the [ __ ]
i am trying to put myself in in the
mindset
of somebody that would say that op is
not the [ __ ] here
i i think there's like a if i'm being
legitimate i think there's like a 25
uh floor for not the [ __ ]
because op always writes the post
right like
when op writes the post they always make
it seem like
here's this issue that's so important to
me
and then my mother-in-law who's like a
typical mother-in-law she's fairly
passive-aggressive
kind of a [ __ ] you know fairly typical
um
it i'm just saying i'm i'm i don't know
why it takes so much issue with that
it's like it it's just such an
unnecessary detail that says so much
about the character
of the of the poster i think they could
have just been like
you know they could have just cut the
sentence
out and not put that evil on all
mother-in-laws
they could have like a mother-in-law is
not even like a
a role you know it's like all
women who have kids who have been
married that's like it's probably like
15
of the population it's such a huge
generalization
it might even be more than that but i
i'm just doing some back of the napkin
anyway
i'm also i'm kinda and i'm not trying to
make you mad chat but
i am kind of losing my mind
at the number of people in chat who are
like what they should have done is taken
the sister-in-law's food
and then blindfolded the mother-in-law
and see if she said she like they told
teller that it's the mother the the
opie's food but it's actually the
sister-in-law
like sure you can probably design the
experiment to be double-blind
scientifically valid repeatable you know
etc etc
maybe you could get a hundred thousand
mother-in-laws that
are you know across multiple
demographics and classes and so on and
so forth
income levels and then you know the
various self-reported degrees of lasagna
enjoyment
um i think it's more like this situation
shouldn't have come to pass in the first
place but
dude you actually i'm i'm stealing from
chad now
but they gave me a a great idea what
about a reality show
oh this [ __ ] was slap man what about a
reality show
it's a cooking competition
two like the mother-in-law from two
families
cook their best dish together like to
compete against one another
and then like gordon ramsay judges who
the best chef of the mother-in-law's is
oh man now that would be a show
you could you could see the fireworks
flying
oh and here for the 400th time uh this
season
we have hot dish this is greta's hot
dish
anyway i'm not trying to insult uh
mother-in-law's just uh
i feel like hot dishes is a common one
my grandma makes something called
pineapple dessert anybody else
ever have pineapple dessert it's it's
literally just
uh canned pineapples and cool whip i
think anytime i go to
uh thanksgiving everyone's like oh you
gotta have some pineapple dessert
i've never had it but uh people they
they
go off on it man they're like you gotta
try it
anyway uh how do i this takes me back
right new reddit that takes me okay
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to bake
without
nuts
i have a feeling i know where this is
going okay so i'm a home baker i really
enjoy baking as an activity i often
make cakes and cookies and share them
with my loved ones because i want to
plus i
just eat them all if i didn't do that i
usually have a lot of nut based recipes
and i really like using nuts
as a topping to make my cakes look good
i recently baked a cake for a friend's
kid who was having a birthday party she
absolutely loved it
so another friend of mine asked me to
bake a cake for her kid i'm not really
close with this friend of mine but her
kid went to the other one's party and
really liked the cake
so she asked me to bake one for her but
without nuts because a few of the kids
coming to the party had
nut allergies i said it wouldn't be the
same cake that her daughter liked
because mine contained walnuts and
almonds which gave the cake its flavor
so far everything's okay all right
it sounds like the baker
made a delicious cake the prospective
customer said hey can you make it
without nuts
and then the baker said no i can't
because it's not
it's not the cake it doesn't sound like
she was like on principle i just will
not cook something without nuts
sounds like she's like it's got an alm
is made with almond flour or something
okay
anyway she asked if i could make a cake
with nut alternatives to achieve a
similar taste
this is now where op
has the moral high ground and this i i
like doing it
you know we're debugging the social
interaction step through
you wanted a free cake
right and then you wanted it without
nuts
the baker says you can't have it without
nuts because it's a nut-based cake
and then the parent said is there any
way you could formulate
a different recipe you know on your own
time
to make a a similar cake like if they
said
well would you be open to making like
another cake that would be something but
like this
can could you do some chemistry research
okay i honestly don't think i can so i
said no
so she told me to just bake a chocolate
cake instead i am going to say
i hope that she didn't say
okay just bake me a chocolate cake
instead i'm hoping that she was like
if you're still up for it we'd just take
a chocolate cake it's a free cake you
know
anyway i told her i'd be happy to bake
the original cake for her because her
kid really liked it and that was the
only reason i was doing it
she got pissed and said it was up to her
to decide which cake she wanted for her
daughter's birthday
i said sure but i won't bake it for you
this is you can see how quickly it came
to pass
[Laughter]
she got passed she complained i'd baked
one for the other kid according to her
specifications it was vegan so i should
do the same for her
i said i did it because the kid herself
was vegan and not some of the guests and
hung up i feel bad because the kid
really liked the cake and wanted one for
her birthday but her mother was annoying
me at this point i don't feel like i'm
the [ __ ] but i'm here so am i the
[ __ ]
pre pre-edit not the [ __ ]
you know we we talked about it like a
little bit last week
um you ever hear the expression again
that like
and and this was about the one where the
art student painted something beautiful
on the wall
thinking that it was gonna get uh
painted over
and then they were like oh i love it and
then they wanted payment and it was a
whole
is a very kind of similar thing here
where you know if someone is doing a
favor
in one direction and then the terms of
the original
favor change a little bit and it becomes
a situation where
i mean i really i hate to be this
cynical but i do sometimes believe in
the expression like no good deed goes
unpunished
you know you hey out of the goodness of
your heart my daughter loved your cake
could you possibly
make her that cake for her birthday yes
i could
i would love to could you make it
without
nuts in it no i can't could you make a
chocolate cake
this is where i think they're like i
could but they didn't even eat that the
first time so they don't even know if
they like it
i think i i think it's a choosing beggar
situation anyway
so far so far edit i wasn't being
commissioned it was a free cake i don't
have a problem baking with not
without nuts i assume this kid wanted my
cake because she liked it
i was surprised because the original
cake had no chocolate at all
so she suddenly turned around and
ordered a cake a la carte which i wasn't
really expecting
as always this is i think why like the
legal system
and like arbitration exists people who
are too
close to the story do not understand
the meat and potatoes of the conflict
i i wish that we could all be reasonable
enough to just hash things out but she's
now talking about like
cake salad cart the original cake had no
chocolate in it and then she wants a
chocolate cake there's a transfer of
chocolate from one date like this
this part is ancillary
i am happy to experiment with my baking
on my own time i don't need tips from
strangers telling me i should broaden my
horizons about baking
i bake what i like to bake it isn't a
job i do it for fun
i didn't force her to take the nut cake
i told her i was only willing to make
the nutcake because that's what her
daughter had asked for i wasn't trying
to force
a nutcake on her to kill kids for
frick's sake
i am not friends with this woman per se
she is more of an acquaintance and i've
only seen her kid maybe three or four
times i've known the other kid since she
was a toddler who said
choo choo to signal food please stop
calling me a woman
men can bake too what the hell is going
on man it's go it's
when you're when you're ahead the op was
so ahead in the argue i think there's a
great lesson here okay
when you're when you're ahead in an
argument when you've just made a good
point when you've got the majority of
people
on your side
you shut up you you did it
you people originally were like if you
read the whole thread up to this point
they would be like you know what you
agreed to make the kid a cake
they uh wanted a cake with
no nuts okay you said i can't make that
cake
my my two cents okay
my two cents is that if you agreed
to make the cake you're not legally
forced to make the cake okay but if you
agreed to make the cake
and it takes one cake's worth of labor
to do it and then they say well if you
can't make it with
nut alternatives can we just have a
chocolate cake
i think that from the ops perspective
little has changed
i would like to think that if i had
already agreed to make a cake in the
first place i would have just made a
different cake
however i wouldn't have gotten myself in
this situation
because i simply my guess is i would not
reply to the text asking me to make the
cake in the first place
i don't know i haven't had a situation
yet where like
my daughter's friend's parents were like
hey can you make a youtube video or
something but
like at some point maybe i'll just send
them a message that's like
no i am oh sorry we're really busy um
but if if op was okay
it was okay making the original cake
then i think it's not so bad
to make a chocolate kick that being said
i also think she's well within her
rights to say no and it definitely i
mean it
it it is hard to make you stand with a
with a choosing beggar
she didn't agree in the first place well
if she didn't agree in the first place
then why are we
even having the discussion right sorry
he
well no they didn't say that it's a male
baker
he just said men can also bake
who's the [ __ ] now
it's implied i don't know if it is
implied
i think they were just trying to land a
a snipe to be like
yeah you know frick you
i could be a man
maybe maybe i'm not but i could be
idiots anyway this again this is we're
getting mired in context
in minutia if the op
didn't exist or didn't agree
to cook the original nut-based cake then
this whole issue gets thrown out of
court
you're not the [ __ ] for not making a
chocolate cake
when you also weren't gonna make the
original cake to begin with okay
so there's that's easy enough so we have
to operate on the assumption that
they were at least suggesting that they
were gonna make the nut based cake
because the child liked it
i it's tough okay
i definitely think the mom
is she she stepped over the line
hey my kid really liked this cake
can you make it without the ingredients
that make it taste like it tastes
no all right we'll just take a chocolate
instead that's a lit i wouldn't feel
comfortable doing that
you know i i mean i think you gotta
be a little bit more socially aware than
that however
i i also think the op i mean the way
that it was responded to was a little
bit over the top
i'm going to say that opie had the right
of refusal
the mom overstepped her bounds on top of
that
but the way that both of these people
responded to it
a little bit juvenile i guess is my
that's my take on the subject
and the the edits that i'm gonna say
it's in everybody sucks here
which is sad because it's a story about
a children's a child's chocolate cake
um but the
edits also make me
think that like it it it reflects more
poorly on op's character
like they were totally fine until they
kept talking and then i was like
my mistake so i i think this is in
everybody sucks here
not the oh wow i'm like way in the
minority on this one
i can scroll down but not the [ __ ] 62
percent
you're the [ __ ] 25 percent everybody
sucks here 8
1 in 12 baby you ca i'll count myself as
part of the one in 12 there
i mean i don't here's the thing it
depends on the question are they the
[ __ ]
for not baking the cake
no are they the [ __ ]
for the way that the discussion ended up
becoming kind of a fight
i think kind of but maybe that's not the
question
so maybe if you're answering are they
the [ __ ] for refusing to bake without
nuts
no but i also feel like i would change
the question maybe not the [ __ ]
an [ __ ] um
i i don't know about am i the [ __ ]
for telling my daughters i made a
mistake for choosing to stay in their
lives
and then not the [ __ ]
i mean i guess at this point i gotta
know right
my ex-wife and i got divorced 14 years
ago it was due to infidelity on her part
the divorce was messy i'm just i'm just
scanning through
i don't know this just seems sad that's
that's a sad pivot you get one per
stream
how about this one am i the [ __ ] for
refusing to flush the toilet when i pee
hold on let's let's look at this one
first i think this one i gotta i gotta
have one with like 100
consensus again to get chat back on my
side am i the [ __ ] for not getting a
summer job and still expecting allowance
my parents were really pushing for me 16
to get a summer job this year i chose
not to instead deciding to volunteer at
our town's historical society
hey okay at first i was going to be like
i got away from my halo infinite beta
code but
they're at least they're volunteer
they're doing something
it's super close so i can literally walk
there i really enjoy working there
because i'm learning new things about
our town and preserving historical
materials and because i enjoy talking
with the people who do come in
it's got me interested in becoming an
archivist about twice a week my history
teacher will volunteer too so it's nice
to get to see a different side of him
than i usually do in class
okay let me guess the other reason that
it's awesome is because like
a part-time job you'd be working like 30
to 60 hours a week
and when you volunteer at the historical
society they're like yeah go ahead why
don't you roll in around one
it's it's a long weekend so it's gonna
be a slow day
anyway uh unfortunately for me my
parents have a rule where over the
summer if i want to buy anything
i need to make the money myself for
whatever reason that means i also have
to pay them
a small fee once a week to even just use
the television
which i haven't been able to pay for
over a month what the hell
okay um
i want to see the inverted situation
here which is uh
am i the [ __ ] for making my 16 year
old kid pay me to use the tv
anyway they haven't been able to pay it
for over a month that's sad they haven't
missed it's not been a lot of good
entertainment
this rule has been there since my older
brother got his first job at 15. since
my sister has a job she has money to do
what she wants even though i spend way
more hours a week working than her
my parents have said that they would
give me an allowance if i did an
internship yet they won't consider
giving me an allowance for what i'm
doing now
this is uh a different situation
you know i said like that the details
were irrelevant for some of these other
stories
this one is like the details are the
only thing that's relevant
back up on the allowance uh
versus internship versus volunteer thing
tell me more
about because if you're if your parents
make you pay to use the tv
there's got to be more meat on that bone
like surely you must do you pitch in for
the groceries
you flush the toilet are your showers
limited to like
you know three minutes for free or
something like that's
this strikes me as insane
at dinner i got into an argument with my
parents which i imagine
you know to argue with them i mean if
the tv is costing you money you're gonna
have to
you know give up your birthday money to
get half an hour of face time
they told me that volunteering at the
historical society isn't something that
warrants
an allowance and i should stop being
lazy and get an internship somewhere or
a job
i told them that that it was unfair even
though i worked more than my sister does
they won't even let me watch television
they explained to me that working at the
historical society doesn't teach skills
that will be valuable to me in the
future and called it a glorified hobby
i told them that what they said was a
load of crap and then they started
yelling at me
am i the [ __ ] okay
what i'm about to say is a little bit
spicy
tell me your parents homeschooled you
without telling me your parents
homeschooled you
some it just seems like this whole
situation is just like off axis a little
bit
apparently they're not homeschooled
because they see their history teacher
at the historical society
he has a history teacher okay
your parents are uh weird dude
like that's my response here your
parents are weird
i don't know what else to say i because
like i i don't really care about whether
or not
you know you should get an allowance for
working at the historical society
um and all of your parents discussion
about whether or not working at the
historical society is valid or whatever
uh that stuff is just not interesting to
me but i
you've done a great job of hooking me up
with the world building
of having parents who make you pay
a small fee once a week to use the
television they make you buy a weekly
television license
it's some of the craziest [ __ ] i've ever
heard
i need to know more hey let me look at
this for a second okay
so that it says everyone sucks but the
actual verdict
was 50 not the [ __ ] 28
everyone sucks here which i'm assuming
is
second year engineering students being
like his parents are right
you got to learn a job that has some
valuable skills
um if well or you could just go without
tv
uh i i feel like i need to
i don't know if my screen region is
gonna work for this but
let me see if i can get into the
comments of the original post here
here we go let's see how this looks
that was my george lucas voice everybody
sucks here get an actual job if you want
things but them not letting you use the
tv is weird and controlling
yeah i mean kind of i still don't think
the kid
sucks like the tv weird stuff is
definitely real
um but
i mean again i i don't think necessarily
the kids should feel
entitled to an allowance but everything
about the parents forcing them to pay to
use the television is
like asinine to me do i i'm still like i
have so many questions like do you
can you watch the tv for free
or do you need to pay
just to view because if i'm paying to
view
i want control of the remote
like i don't want to just pay you 10
bucks on like saturday and then i got to
sit there and watch
the view or whatever like i want to be
able to put on
hbo or something like that like there's
just so much
going on here or do they just have like
a room with a tv
in it and like a coin slot or something
i don't know
anyway
yeah the tv thing seems way overly harsh
on the parents
it's not as if opi is sat on his arse
vegetating all day he's volunteering and
learning useful skills
maybe a compromise is he gets an
allowance and he's allowed to watch tv
for doing a few chores
although i'd just let the poor kid watch
tv without charging him
um
ladies and gentlemen the nobel uh peace
prize winner
for nicest individual person who would
let their 16 year old
child watch a a tv that had
presumably already been paid for that's
taking the moral high ground
let's let's see what else we got here
right sorry collapse you can collapse
the i'm learning i'm learning to be less
of a boomer
everybody sucks here those are harsh
rules and i think making you pay for
using stuff in the house normally free
is bs but the problem is with the
expectation of money
you can't do that especially not at your
age at
what because it was kind of like almost
a little
following if not with you but what do
you mean especially at your age
as a child isn't that like one of the
only times you can expect
to get money for nothing from your
parents
everybody sucks here your parents are a
bit too strict charging for a tv
i'm a grouchy old dad and i didn't even
do that
people are like
people are like look you should get a
job but
they should also let you watch the tv
for free
as for you you approach it all wrong
telling your parents they're full of
crap is not advice given in how to win
friends and influence people oh yes this
is from the
the reddit user proud boomer
who thinks that uh the bible for social
interaction
is uh a sales handbook written in like
1925.
this is the kind of guy when you meet
him he asks your name and then he just
repeats it like 75 times in conversation
with you
until you either get creeped out or
hypnotized
you want credit for working hard show
them the path you've laid out
be polite apologize for the crap comment
let them know that they got through to
you and you'd like to share your
thoughts in a polite conversation
send send them a a summons for
non-binding
arbitration
i love this what what is your potential
income
and what does the job market look like
bro he's 16
potential income dog [ __ ] job market
[ __ ] horrible what do you think what
do you think the job market looks like
he's in like 10th grade
it's that's crazy man that's that's some
of the most
ridiculous stuff i've ever heard in my
entire life
all right yeah there we go hey we
finally we scrolled until we found a
comment we agreed with
not the [ __ ] charging you money to
watch tv is bad [ __ ] insane and
volunteer work is just as valuable as
employment oh man
this is this is good i love this a lot
of people are saying everybody sucks
here and he needs to grow up and learn
about the real world
implying that you can enjoy something
and make money with it holy s
this modern day mentality is rough to
try and follow we just normalize hating
our lives just so we can survive okay
that one i read the first part of it and
i was like i'm with it and then i
realized this is a chat comment and
that's fine
i i am surprised by the amount of people
though that like are leaving comments
not acknowledging that the child is 16
years old
like if they were like 30
and they wanted an allowance from their
parents and their parents were like you
got to try to stand on your own two feet
a little bit more than that and like
maybe make sacrifices
um you know that
maybe you have to sacrifice doing
something that you enjoy a lot
in order to get to the point where
instead you know you can pay for your
own bills that's something
but uh at 16 it's it's crazy
as a parent hold on as a parent
say something about as a parent say
something about the tv
not the [ __ ] because of the tv thing
it's not costing them extra to let you
watch it i'm glad that more people are
talking about this
the tv thing is is insane
i've never heard anything like that
before in my life
as a parent i agree with the person who
said as a parent okay
i think we got one more oh man we we do
have a
we do have uh i don't know if this is an
update but very similar from
last week am i the [ __ ] [ __ ] for
purposely leaving my car parked out in
front of a stranger's house for even
longer after he rudely asked me to move
it
[ __ ] post deleted great stuff man
it's there's so much uh so many parking
related uh am i the [ __ ]
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to flush
the toilet when i pee
oh my god this is weird i know but it'll
be short and to the point
the thing is like it's gonna be weird
but it's also gonna be short and and to
the point which is
is good anyway um
anyway i pee a lot i think it's an
incredible waste to flush the toilet
every time you pee
to me doing that is the weird thing it's
completely normal for me to just leave
short shortened to the point by the way
let me restate this sentence
that was very clear the first time 30 or
40 times uh it's completely normal for
me to leave my pee in the toilet and
really only flush for poo i don't see
the issue with this but my boyfriend
hates it
he says it's absolutely disgusting and i
act like an animal doing that he
shouldn't be subjected to my bodily
fluids just because
i want to be a cheapskate hey some guys
would uh pay extra for that hi
oh i don't know i can see his point i
guess but honestly i don't really see
the issue i i can see his point
on the one hand on the other hand i
don't really see his point
plus it's my house we've been talking i
was gonna say it's my car
plus it's my house we've been talking
about him moving in but he says not
flushing after every use is a
non-starter and he won't even consider
moving in with me until i promise to
always flush
i'm considering just breaking up with
him no this is fake i don't
okay let's pretend it's real i'm
considering just breaking up with him
because i have no desire to stop it's an
ingrained
if this is real you need to actually
break up to save him from you
because this is like if you can't
compromise on flushing the toilet when
you pee
like then you you're not going to be
able to make it work
on like because this is such a minor
thing right like you'd literally have to
agree on
everything you're like
flush after i urinate absolutely not
uh anyway that's a deal breaker
uh it's an ingrained habit i don't feel
like putting in the work to stop that's
that's a good sign that you're ready for
a
serious relationship plus i genuinely
feel like i'm saving water from being
wasted on top of that it saves me money
on my water and electric bill am i crazy
is this something everyone would be
disgusted by or is this bizarre behavior
should i just suck it up and start
flushing everything should i just suck
it up and
start flushing every time i pee
could i could i shoulder the incredible
burden of sucking it up every time i pee
at this point i don't even know who's
the crazy one here
it's already tldr it's already short af
if you don't want to read a single
paragraph then i don't know what to tell
you law
and then moving on
okay so from what i've gathered from the
comments this habit is not
overwhelmingly considered right or wrong
and seems to be a cultural thing some
people have said it's
absolutely disgusting or bizarre while
other people have said they've always
lived this way and have never seen the
problem
generally though you all agree this is
something i'd be willing to stop if i
cared enough about the relationship and
honestly this made me realize you're
right
that is not the word i expected to be
there
uh i expected it wrong but that's okay
i hadn't considered that my lack of
desire to put in the work of breaking a
lifelong habit is indicative of my
lukewarm feelings towards my
relationship
thank you for pointing it out i
appreciate everyone's perspective on
this
you i so i think what i i people are
saying good ending
that's not the way i'm taking this
though i think she's saying
you're right i clearly don't care about
my boyfriend very much so i'm gonna
break up with him
rather than you're right this is a
limited amount of compromise that is
emblematic of wanting to save my
relationship
which could be again the first one could
be fine
if you're not willing to compromise
flushing the toilet for your boyfriend
you know it's a good ending for him
especially maybe
but at the same time i think she got
maybe
the wrong lesson from it she's like my
significant other or letting my urine
fester in the toilet until i actually
take a poop on top of it
uh and then flush it down
she chose she chose to poop on her piss
that's what she chose
i i if i were the if i were the
significant other i would be a little
upset
kill me
[Laughter]
anyway second edit oh here we go
what does flushing a toilet have to do
with an electric with electricity my
well water is well water and uses a pump
which is electric
literally you spent
more money typing that out than the
electrical cost of using your toilet if
i had to guess
like this is literally like focusing on
the pennies and making the pounds take
care of themselves
no one's ever like hey i mean the water
sure
but like oh man my electric bill is
getting so high i gotta stop uh
i gotta stop flushing so much look she's
i know she's
the water stuff is fair okay
i mean water is pretty cheap here but i
don't know if that's the case everywhere
and it gets recycled at like 99.999
efficiency or something by the
wastewater treatment plant but
regardless
the water i i at least give it a sense
but the the actual electricity i don't
know about that
how often do you flush ip on average
once every 90 minutes
that uh honestly you're you're preaching
to the choir on this one i go to the
bathroom frequently
throughout the day i'll flush every five
or six p's
and i always flush during my final pee
before bed that's [ __ ]
insane
are you keeping a tally on the like on
the bathroom wall or something
you flush every five or six ps i do want
to know what happens when she has a
she's peed once and then she has to poo
does she pre-flush
poo and then flush or does she poop on
the p
because i feel like if you poop on the p
that's dirty as hell
that's bad you so you've got to
pre-flush the p
to begin with like i feel like she's not
getting
all the value out of this that she
thinks she is
so i got to put a rush in on this so i
can be there for justin
do i flush a bunch of tp all at once i
actually don't flush tp ever i have a
small bidet i only need a little tp
which i toss in the trash
sure okay fair enough and yes the
miniscule amount of water this uses is
much preferable to the gallons of water
that would be flush daily
again we we have uh okay maybe she's
talking about from a financial
standpoint she's not talking about a
wastewater treatment plant
i can understand i mean i think if
you're using a bidet i don't know
i mean i feel like you still just put it
in the toilet that's where the toilet
paper goes but
do i not have more than one bathroom i
do and have already offered to only use
one and he can use the other this is not
acceptable to him
one final thing i'd like to add for
people saying peace thinks i highly
suggest you up your water intake yeah i
get it your personality is being the
person who goes to the bathroom all the
time and is like really proud of their
piss
like congrats
other people like have real problems not
me but like in general
oh yeah sorry yeah sorry for saying piss
stinks uh
i was on call at the hospital as a
trauma surgeon in the er for 36 hours so
i didn't get that much time to
you know up my electrolyte count thanks
a lot yeah you're right i should just
drink more water
yeah i'm i'm a big you're the [ __ ] on
this one quite frankly
i don't know why she's so proud of her
piss
i also the economic argument does not
hold for me
what percentage of your monthly utility
bill
is uh is the toilet
it's got to be like under five percent
considering all the other things you do
in your house like you know
your shower water i guess water for
cooking is not that much compared to the
toilet
i guess she does pee a lot under one
percent
she better not have an air conditioner
that's all i'm saying anyway she's like
a little crazy
she's a little she's a little pee crazy
she's got p on the brain
either way slash marker



i i do want to check out we want plates
but we've actually gotten some some
great posts i'm gonna i'm gonna keep
going down this a little bit here
uh just cause we we've we've gotten some
really spicy ones today honestly
like these these have been genuinely the
first couple were a little
milk toast these ones are getting to
some
some interesting territory where i
disagree a lot which is
is new to me
so many so many
red flares what about this one
uh am i the for nagging my
sister into getting pregnant earlier
that's gonna be a weird one am i the
 for telling my ex-co-workers
employer the reason why she was
ostracized at the company
my ex-co-workers employer okay
let's see
this sounds bad it sounds like you're
the
it's a billion paragraphs long it has
like 15 edits oh man okay 4 500 comments
this story actually takes place over
multiple years oh you don't say
george rr martin
malding right now
we'll try to go fast
uh here goes also english isn't my first
language so i apologize for my poor
language skills in advance a little
background i work in corporate hr my
company is a very generous maternity
leave policy it gives you 26 paid weeks
off and the option of taking a month or
so more if you have extra sick or
personal leaves left or else you can
take unpaid leave for the same time okay
so there's 26 paid weeks that's like
it's like six months that's that's
pretty good so part of my
responsibilities is to make
recommendations for selecting employers
or employees for specific projects
so a couple of years ago there was a
huge project that needed a team to be
created for being part of a project like
this would normally establish your
career in the industry you could decide
your own career path based on the
reputation you get based on a project
like this it would be hectic and
difficult but worth it in the end let me
guess
i'm just guessing
i'm just guessing
i didn't want to select anybody that
might have the audacity to be planning
on getting pregnant and then they had
that
son of a got pregnant
and i took that personally because it
reflected poorly on me for not being
nostradamus that's just my guess
that's my guess of what's happening
we interviewed prospective people within
the company and selected a core team
that would take it up among this team
was emma a recently married female who
was generally thought to be a hard
worker and quite knowledgeable like with
everyone else we interviewed her for the
spot and asked her if she wanted to be
part of it however a month or so in emma
announces that she was pregnant and that
she would be taking her maternity leave
in a month's time she would be
completely unavailable for around seven
months and basically leave the team
short staffed for the major part of the
project we had to quick quickly select
the replacement get them up to speed and
have them take over it meant more work
for everyone minor delays etc etc this
someone in chat said this is capsaicin
level spicy and it absolutely is because
even we're only four paragraphs in here
and i'm
like let me start by saying i can
understand
in the most generous reading possible
that somebody would be like
i if they were planning on getting
pregnant or maybe they already were
pregnant
um but just weren't announcing it yet
uh
it would have been nice if you had let
hr know that so that we could have
discriminated against you by not putting
you on this project that's gonna make
your career
however
i also feel like if you don't exercise
and i don't work in the corporate
environment okay but i feel like if you
don't exercise um
you know your rights by
it sounds like she was appointed to the
project as a
you know it was a meritocracy she
interviewed for it she got the project
uh and and earned it if you don't go for
that
uh
even if you are pregnant you're just
screwing yourself over it's not like the
company is gonna be like oh thanks for
not uh doing that career advancing move
in advance of you trying to establish a
family now we're going to give you a
promotion if it you know in the future
it might end up biting her in the ass if
she had been
nice about it because if she's going up
against other candidates that that
played the game a little bit better she
would be at a disadvantage
moreover
just the post-existing just makes me mad
because i'm like
i
look
not everybody
most most people will probably agree i
think but not everybody will agree but
uh
you know
your life is your life and your career
you know it's it's your job like this is
two very
different priorities and i think they
they
change weightings in your life for sure
like when when you're younger before you
you know
have a long-term serious relationship or
before you're thinking about having kids
or something like maybe you're not
thinking about like your health or
something like that your career could be
your life but
you know the idea like that oh what what
a for putting her career on the
back burner to take advantage of her
relatively narrow window to start the
family that she wants to have like
that's crazy
that that someone would would try to
hold that against them anyway so so far
i think we're that that's where i'm at
four paragraphs in
let's keep it moving
um
what pissed off the top management was
that m knew she was pregnant when she
joined the team she never mentioned it
during the interview because then we
would have not uh hired her by not
telling anyone in advance everyone felt
that she can't be trusted in the future
she basically became a pariah and no
team lead wanted her in any of the
critical projects
wow um
[Laughter]
that's pretty bad
also like yeah it seems insanely illegal
you're not supposed to admit that part
i think you're you're just supposed to
like uh do it but not tell anybody like
don't send any emails or make any posts
or anything like that because if you
ever end up in court you're gonna get
you know raked over the coals
she's gonna take you for all you're
worth
within a year em realized she progressed
much in her career at this particular
company and left for another job i
wonder why
[Laughter]
after she had the audacity to get
pregnant and make all of us do a little
bit
it meant more work for everybody minor
delays etc etc
um she she decided finally to leave um
fast forward a little while i was
talking with the hr guy from the company
emma joined and he asked me about her
this seems like
i don't know if this is like a violation
of privacy rights or something
emma joined he asked me about her i told
him the truth
both that she was a good worker and is
dedicated but that she is not honest or
trustworthy
what
because she got pregnant
because she's not honest
or trustworthy oh my god sorry sorry i i
need to scroll down a little bit here
that's crazy man now this basically
meant that m gets a similar treatment at
the new company she is considered a good
employee or team player but no one wants
to select her for any critical projects
why you're just like a piece of
then huh
it's not enough that you did it to her
for essentially no good reason when she
was at your company now she goes to a
new company because you guys treated her
like garbage and then you torpedoed her
there as well
some of my friends say that telling hr
about the incident makes an ass with two
dollars
it has gotten me to feel a bit guilty oh
oh well we wouldn't want what to happen
that op feels a little guilty for
terrorizing a woman for two different uh
employees or two different employers
just because of the fact that they they
shed something that might be a wiggle
i wasn't sure what the right move should
be ps feel free to ask for more
information if you need it i've already
uh said the quiet part loud and uh in
court will lose my entire life savings
um i might as well just keep going uh i
just want to be clear em knew she was
pregnant did i mention that part like
she was exercising her human rights uh
you know and then
acting appropriately given the labor
laws of the uh country she lives in uh
she wanted to be in the project so she
didn't disclose that she was pregnant
her team
you're thinking a lot about this
lady
you're not you're not thinking at all
about her team
they had to pick up the slack on this
one man the company had no choice
there was absolutely nothing well the
ceo probably could have taken a 0.05
cut to their salary to hire another
equally able person to do that but no
there's nothing that could have been
done she torpedoed this multi-million
dollar serious project by just getting
pregnant and not telling us
her team it's not about me it's her team
had to stretch themselves thin to make
it up
our company has a general oh as a
general rule as a general rule we have
no issues with women taking time off for
pregnancy
in specific situations
we may have some issues with as a
general rule we're all for it
we love it
happy families make happy workers but in
this one unique situation
uh we're gonna treat you i believe their
words were um it pissed off the top
management uh she was she could can't be
trusted in the future she became a
pariah no team lead wanted her in any
critical projects uh
i told the other hr rep that she's a
good worker but she's not honest or
trustworthy
but in general we don't have issues
legally speaking if a lawyer is asking
us is a general rule we don't have
issues in specific situations we might
break the law
in order to just ruin someone else's uh
professional life just to be petty
but as a rule
we're all for it
even beyond the policy mandated time the
most i've come across as a woman getting
15 months off she came back to work and
faced no repercussions
at first i thought you were you were an
and i'm happy to admit that i was so
wrong
because
now you've you've pointed out that a
woman has taken advantage of all of the
uh
maternity leave that she's entitled to
and she didn't even face any
repercussions
thought for sure you would bring her
back and then maybe after that you know
you would maybe treat her as a pariah or
uh gossip about how she's on trustworthy
to every other employer within her
industry but she didn't even face any
repercussions
and you're gonna say that they're the
i should have mentioned this before but
the hr guy was formally asking me about
m it wasn't like i was talking about her
at the pub i don't work in hr but this
actually like almost feels worse to me
like i think if you were intoxicated at
the
pub i would be like you know maybe loose
lips sink ships or whatever but wait
can you formally ask
about an employee i guess if they phone
you on your work phone that's a formal
ask
i don't know where people got the idea
that she was just a month into the
pregnancy when she was interviewed
just to clarify she was pregnant long
enough that she knew she wouldn't be
completing the project everybody's
talking about her feelings nobody's even
thinking about the feelings of the
cement plant that we were building
nobody's talked nobody has asked how the
cement plant feels about this
everybody's just worried about the human
being it's crazy
she didn't mention it because she wanted
the project on her resume bro everybody
gets this
everybody knows she didn't mention it
because she wanted to be on the project
because if she told you that was that
she was pregnant you clearly would not
have selected her for a project that
she's worthy of being on
our company never punishes an employee
for taking maternity leave
obviously
it's still
every every point of defense that they
offer in this post is literally we
follow the law
okay
we followed the legal rule of the law
except for like a couple of times when i
gossip um but like
in this one specific situation
i really think that she should have let
us discriminate against her
but in this case the team lead did not
want her on their team
for high profile projects after she
returned because they didn't trust her
to be forthright
because if she was forthright you
wouldn't
have hired her for the project which
would have put her further back in her
career
just to benefit a company that in all
likelihood especially based on this post
doesn't actually care for her well-being
whatsoever
i thought it would be obvious but our
source for m's motivations were m
herself she admitted all of this herself
so does that change anything that she
admitted that she knew she was pregnant
when she applied for the job
and just to clarify i didn't put out a
blanket statement of her trustworthiness
even though i said
she's not really honest or trustworthy
i explained the incident and explained
it due to this her co-workers consider
her untrustworthy it is in me
i don't consider her untrustworthy i
just said to the other hr rep nobody
thinks she's trustworthy
there's it wasn't me
i didn't say i think she can't be
trusted i said nobody thinks she can be
trusted
by the way i'm i'm losing my mind
because the uh judgment here
not the 50 you're the 47
percent
so even though the flare is over
time
the votes tallied and
not the ended up being in in
first
i don't even think this is like a a
super like woke opinion
just like the the
you have an obligation as an employee to
you know propel yourself
as far ahead as possible especially
within the bounds of like legality
and the company just won't give a
about you at all like the lies or the
the laws are there to be exercised you
know
anyway let's let's click on this
okay here we go
you're the laws may be different
where you are
but in america what you did would be an
illegal move we have laws to protect
workers from that kind of
you have no business whatsoever having
that conversation your company your
rules
yeah this is in the usa i assumed the 26
weeks of maternity leave may have clued
everyone else in um maybe you could have
told from the fact that we have a
great maternity leave that there are no
repercussions for exercising usually
that we're in a country that actually
cares about its workers rights except
for um why would it be illegal to share
her performance details with her new
employer and her performance details of
course were getting pregnant and not
telling anybody
hey ladies just remember
when you see that pregnancy test when
you see those two lines pop up the first
phone call you gotta make is to your
boss okay
it is not nice
to not let your boss know first then
father of the child
maybe your parents if they've if they've
done their essay recently
100 you're the she didn't have
to tell you she was pregnant
when interviewing for a project what you
did was ethically wrong as someone in hr
you should have known better than to do
that
yeah um yeah
if you're in the u.s she could sue you
yes
i do have to check like let's look at an
opinion that we don't necessarily agree
with okay
she didn't have to say she was pregnant
the only obligation she had was not
committing to a responsibility she knew
she shouldn't be able she wouldn't be
able to fulfill she chose to make that
commitment in the full knowledge and
intent of not fulfilling it corporate
lawyer spotted the reason for which she
wasn't available is irrelevant she said
she would do something she had no
intention of doing the word for that is
lying and as a direct result of her lie
several colleagues including the other
mothers on the project
is there is there a uh won't somebody
think of the mother's fallacy
[Laughter]
i'm pretty sure that the other mothers
can be asked for their opinion uh if
they existed this situation why don't we
ask the other mothers what they think
about uh what em did in this situation
and see whose side they're on
that would be an interesting
conversation they might not agree with
me i just think that rather than put
words in their mouth it might be good to
ask them
um
had to put in they had to put in
additional labor there was nothing the
company could have done regardless of
what legalities may or may not obtain
morally op is in the clear regardless of
the laws that they broke morally they're
in the clear that's important uh for
sharing this relevant information with
her new employer protected category does
not mean exempt from the standards of
ethical behavior
thanks for the gold really thanks for
the gold kind sir okay
uh we disagree let's put it that way
op you may go to prison
but
go there with with a song in your heart
knowing you did the morally right thing
not the
you mentioned in a comment she admitted
to knowing she was pregnant it wouldn't
be there for 80. you may actually you
mentioned in your entire comment uh
about 20 times to knowing that she was
pregnant it wouldn't be there for 80 of
the project but didn't tell anyone
because she wanted it on her resume in
that case she definitely isn't a team
player and admitted to it as well your
honor i may have breached the privacy
standards uh that have been set out in
the charter rights for citizens of this
country but have you considered
the plaintiff
is not a team player
the plaintiff
they didn't give 110 percent they didn't
go into the boards
to try to win hard puck battles they
didn't do the little things right
they're not a team player
hi i have a genuine question about this
for all the you're the responses
i'm a woman and while reading this i
thought he wasn't the i don't
know much about hr work so that could be
it but could someone explain it to me
i'm aware you can't have someone miss
work opportunities because they're
pregnant but she basically missed the
entire project it feels unfair to me
that she would miss
probably 90 of a massive project and
didn't tell anyone can someone help me
out also i understand how he's the
 for telling the hr guy a few
years later but i don't understand how
he was originally
i i am just like and i i i actually like
understand it
because i think if you put yourself in
the position
where you're like uh like imagine you
were doing a group project
and you were like hey you want to be in
my group
and then
a week into a 16-week project they were
like
by the way i'm gonna be like going to
school abroad for the next four months
and i won't be able to help out that
much i think you would be
annoyed a little bit the flip side of
that though is that you know when you're
in the rat race
it's uh
kind of every person out for themselves
and when you're
what's the word i'm looking for here
when you're willfully
not taking advantage of the labor laws
that are given to you as a human being
you're giving the company the benefit of
the doubt and the labor laws are there
so that your company doesn't uh exploit
you because they probably
you know as a as a result of you doing
what you might feel is the nice thing
you would probably end up holding your
career back you know potentially
permanently as a result
so i feel like you you have a resp the
the company has a responsibility to
treat you to the letter of the law and
you have a responsibility to yourself
and your future self to act with you
know within the scope of your rights as
well
yeah not to mention i mean this is not
even uh
worth pointing out necessarily but
uh
you know it's not like she took a
six-month vacation
[Laughter]
like
you know it's probably like a couple of
weeks getting ready for the baby uh
absolutely
uh
terrible 48 hours in the hospital
followed by six months of learning how
to raise a brand new human infant right
and then the other part of this that
pisses me off is everyone's acting like
they're they the company had no choice
but to make the team
like now five people have to do six
people's work why don't you just put
another person
on the project
i don't
understand like there there's so many
other alternatives here
plus they did but they had hey you
forgot the part where they had to get
them up to speed hey you forgot the part
where they had to get him up to speed
man
anyway i'm a woman in hr most people
have their us lens on it's unethical to
knowingly volunteer for a project you
won't be available for just for the
resume pop
look is it unethical
i don't think so
i really don't is it not nice
yeah
i think it's not nice
i think it is kind of a not nice thing
to do
but at the same time i think
i don't know i'm
very unethical i'm trying to think about
i mean i know where i stand on the issue
and you do too if you're listening to me
simultaneously but
like you're there to like that's what
the law is there for
you know if if you
have the right to protect the
information about whether or not you're
pregnant or planning on getting
pregnant in the future because it's
considered a privacy violation because
they can discriminate in hiring
decisions then by keeping that
information private i don't think that's
unethical at all that's what it's there
for
is it unethical from like a greek
philosopher's standpoint i'm like i
don't know who cares
well i guess the thing i'm thinking is
uh would the company also uh be ethical
towards her and based on the response of
the corporate hr here my answer is
probably not uh so
i i feel like
you know i i think she did what she
should have done
hold on let's close this one up
i'm probably going to be down voted for
this but not the they asked for
your opinion and you were honest she was
dishonest in the recruitment process and
cause stress for the team
what a
she the only reason she even had that
baby was to piss us off man
so
selfish couldn't she have just waited
like three years for the project to be
done and then have the baby although
then by getting that uh project done she
probably would have been up for some new
job interviews and possibly could have
started interviewing at new places for a
huge increase in her salary at which
point she wouldn't want to get pregnant
then either because it would be
unethical to like interview for a new
job knowing you have a plan to have a
family in the future so then she would
like go work at a new job she might be
promoted in like a management position
and then she's gonna have the audacity
to have a kid at that point when you
know she's in charge of all these
deliverables for a large like when is it
oh and then she's dead she died of old
age okay well now it's now it's her free
time she can do it whatever she pleases
not the you might get beat up
over that whole pregnancy is private
thing
but it's like anything else if you know
you can't complete a project for any
reason and hide it you deserve a
reputation you don't deserve a
reputation as someone who can be trusted
people are crazy man
i'm like
i i don't know what to say you're the
 a huge one deleted
they must have been cyber bullied man
no woman is required to disclose their
pregnancy and in fact it is illegal to
ask in interviews if it was a man you
never would have done this and your
company wouldn't have blacklisted her
you and your company are misogynistic
punishing a woman for having a child and
then ruining her future opportunities
get over yourself
where's the lie
there's a million reasons she could have
thought she would be able to work
through her pregnancy it's highly
unusual for someone to take maternity
leave during the pregnancy unless it is
a high risk pregnancy that's true
usually at most you know
well you don't want to use much of your
maternity leave in advance or the
pregnancy or in advance of the delivery
i should say because you really need
that time afterwards to get adjusted to
life with the baby like you
i mean sometimes it can happen i guess
but again whether you know you can't
discriminate
whether or not to put someone on a
project based on whether or not their
pregnancy is high risk unless you're
like the devil um
unless it is a high-risk pregnancy we
don't know her history we don't know her
past experiences every single person in
these comments is villainizing her
without even giving her the benefit of
the doubt this wasn't some big
conspiracy or strategic manipulation she
should should she have gotten pregnant
at a more convenient time for her
co-workers
i don't know where you all live and work
but you clearly deserve better labor
laws if you don't see why this is wrong
i can only imagine that you think it's
normal in many places this would never
slide i mean i i agree
i it sucks maybe i'm gonna have to
delete the the vod if i get this kind of
response to it
i'll just get over it i was there for
the pop play
what no
she was already an employee she was
merely being selected for the project
in normal circumstances we would never
ask oh this is opie we would never ask
or expect to be told beforehand about a
pregnancy it's normal
in general we're very pro-pregnancy
we're
we love giving out the legally required
maternity leave as a general rule we
would never expect to be told beforehand
but again in this one specific location
or situation we're not asking you to
tell us you're you're planning on
getting pregnant we're just asking to
for you to forgo
any and all opportunities
if you're planning at some point and
having a family
but when she was offered a spot to the
project team we expected her to inform
us she wouldn't be available for about
80 of the period no woman would be
punished for having a child if that was
true do you honestly think we'd have
such a maternity leave policy
so i look i there's two people i want to
hear from here okay
i want to hear from the perspective of
the other mothers on the team
and then secondarily i also want to hear
from the i want to know what the project
was
wouldn't it be great if they work at
like party city and it was like a
refresh for like what their halloween
costumes are going to look like
halloween 2022.
would that change your opinion on this
or if they worked at uh yum brands
incorporated and they were trying to
figure out how to tweak the recipe for
the wendy's spicy chicken sandwich
[Laughter]
like i've been i've been operating on
the assumption that this is like some
kind of infrastructure construction
project or something like that how funny
would it be if it was like you know we
need to figure out
what the movie poster
for the new black panthers gonna look
like we gotta composite it you can't
afford to take six months off from this
this is a big deal
anyway this is uh i you know what there
is some arguments here don't get me
wrong but this is uh
pardon me this is uh this is what it's
all about man is spice and and spice is
nice
when it comes to the the react content
at least i mean we were on that one for
like like half an hour
i don't know my
in this situation my my perspective it's
going to be very hard to to tilt me
off of the idea that if she's operating
within her legal rights anything that
she can do to uh
advance her career if it's only at the
expense of the feelings of the
corporation she works for then you know
that's what you got to do because uh i i
would expect that the company would
leave her in the lurch as well
that's my take on that
also her co-workers though
i i think her co-workers should be of
the opinion that why can't we just i
mean they put another person on the
project right
admittedly uh the the biggest project
i've ever done in my life was probably
like three months long it was a little
game i made in unity for like a
programming class
[Laughter]
so i've never built a nuclear reactor or
you know like a big wind farm or
something like that but
i would like to think that if i was
working on a project like that uh and
then my company
uh said hey we got to take someone off
the team and put someone new on i'd be
like why and they'd be like oh she's
having a baby and i'd be like oh
congrats
i don't know maybe i i haven't been in
the corporate environment long enough to
when the doors close everything becomes
like succession and you just how dare
she
how dare she make me for the next week
respond to more emails and sign more
forms or something like i don't
admittedly i don't know and i'm only
coming from the perspective of what i
know i'm not saying that's how the real
world works but that's that's where i
fell on that issue
she didn't even give the calico cut
pants
i and the other thing is i think you got
to put it on the flip side
you know if she
goes
i'm going to get pregnant they don't put
her on the project
she takes her maternity leave if you put
if you put the if you play the tape
forward for like
you know 10 years on that what is it
getter
is the company under any obligation in
the future to
uh
be like hey she you know did right by us
in the past so next time we get a
project we're going to give her a leg up
like no it's that's like a handshake
wink wink sort of deal right
so i think she's got to take you know
her opportunity to
you know to get ahead when she can and
it's she did it on merit it's not like
she was stabbing people in the back
also it's not even just that
is she the for not admitting to
the pregnancy in the first place which
again who cares in my opinion at least i
don't work for the company obviously
though unless it was amazon in which
case you're stealing food out of my
kid's mouth
um
the other
question is should she have been
outed for this at her new company and
that one i think i'd
definitely i'm like you should just keep
your mouth shut dude i understand you
got a chip on your shoulder but
anyway
we're moving on
am i the for selling my vacation
apartment to one daughter even though my
other daughter asked for it first am i
the for being rich
no
but let's
let's see where this goes
okay everyone
so many people in chat were like
you you we hate you not to me but
to the the poster hello lovely people
have read it that's the first like one
word or one sentence
for some context i'm a 78 year old woman
living alone
are you going to change your your tune
now
she seems like an unaffable lady so far
i know you were you thought it was john
taffer didn't you
i bet you thought it was john tafford
no yes i own a house that i live in and
my children grew up in in a beachfront
apartment this is where our family
vacation often when the children were
growing up i have two daughters that
i'll call violet and rose in this story
okay so your children are in their you
know their middle age health issues have
led me to be unable to maintain this
apartment so i was looking to sell
i mean yeah names have been
changed to protect the innocent uh let's
uh let's just call one of them desdemona
and the other one
it's anyway um
so i was looking to sell i mentioned
this briefly to violet last year during
the stage where i only considered
selling and she said when i was ready
she would buy it i said that would be
lovely and the conversation ended
when i decided to officially sell three
months ago i told violet and rose and to
my surprise rose also offered to buy it
she never mentioned wanting to buy this
but she had been looking at other
holiday properties around the area
neither of them were budging on their
offer so i suggested they co-buy it
which was meant with a firm no from both
of them for reasons i won't get into
they were never close unfortunately
after deliberating for some time i made
the decision to offer it to
uh the open market as a result of this
situation because i worried that it
would create negative feelings uh in my
family if i chose uh one of the
daughters over the other one
nope
i decided to offer it to rose despite
the fact that violet asked for it first
for several reasons rose is only a two
hour drive away and would get more use
out of it rose was already visiting it
at least once every two to three months
while violet visits it once every one to
two years violet lives across the
country about a four hour plane ride
away with coveted lockdowns that makes
it difficult for her to come honestly i
do have to say that seems like a pretty
good reason
rose is married with three children that
love the beach while violet is on
married with a partner but no kids and
is out of child bearing age of that
matters
not something that typically comes out
up in the real estate buying process but
you got her i guess my eldest
granddaughter was already strongly
considering living in it before i
announced selling it because she has
plans on attending college university
about 20 minutes away
this
look would i would i
maybe have suggested just selling it uh
on the open market to avoid uh family
drama maybe but these seem like one in
three in particular seem like good
reasons to give it to to sell it to one
over the other i believe selling derose
means the apartment will get more use
and enjoyment and violet will still be
able to visit for vacations if rose
permits and isn't using it however
violet is extremely upset and refuses to
talk to both rose and i she believes i'm
disadvantaging her because hey it's like
the the the flip side
rose is what happens when you exercise
your legal rights to have
children in the middle of a work project
and violate is what happens when you
choose to be career focused see you and
then people start having kids the people
that have kids get concessions because
they have kids and you're out here like
i gave up that time in order to advance
my career and i'm getting still hit over
it and they're like yeah but at least
you behaved ethically the whole time um
no kids no cottage it's that simple at
the end of the day it's my apartment i
believe i have the right to choose who
to sell to violet has offered to pay
more for the apartment in an attempt to
sway me healthy family environment for
sure
um
get get your kids involved in a bidding
war
um over your vacation home just because
of the fact that uh they don't like each
other apparently at the end of the day
i'm a nearly 80 year old woman racked
with health issues to put it bluntly i
don't have many years left in me and i
don't care about the money so am i the
 for choosing to sell to rose
dude i'm i don't know what happened to
me over the past couple of
weeks i'm like i'm off my freaking
rocker man
you're the 48 not the 39
percent well where do i fall on this
imo not the but let's read the
edit at least
i i do have to say by the way the am i
the for choosing to sell the
rose even though my other daughter asked
for it first
uh if you're if your children in this
dispute are like
you know in their 50s
asking for it first is not like that's
like a schoolyard law
this is not how we settle
you know disputes especially over stuff
that's this serious once you enter the
adult world
mom
i called shotgun
i i licked the wall and said my germs
and now you're gonna sell it to
violet instead or rose i can't keep it
straight anyway
i feel conflicted so i would like some
outside opinions i appreciate all these
comments i do not favor rose for having
ch now i i can understand on reddit why
she ended up being the you're
the for discriminating against
your own daughter for not having kids
post history r slash child free r slash
antinatalism
r slash uh a boring dystopia our slash
late stage capitalism
etc etc um i was nearly like violet i
didn't get married until i was 37 by
choice and didn't have children until i
was 38 and 41 because i focused on my
career i thought i would never want to
get married or have children
critical hit oh no
okay okay let's i just want to read the
comments okay
you're the violet asked you
first
and you're
to be fair she did say that would be
lovely
it sounded like you were supportive of
her buying it your reasons for selling
at the rose are arbitrary and
essentially assumptions on your part i
don't blame violet for being upset with
you how you responded to the situation
appears to be favoritism look
oh my god i i refuse to read this
you you know how to use reddit
formatting that's you've self-selected
that i will not read your comment i'm
sorry that's rude i'm still not going to
read it but i apologize um
i disagree with the judgment on this one
that being said
i do
understand that she did say
hey mom i'll buy the vacation home off
of you and then you said that would be
lovely now
at the same time that might have come up
casually speaking
you know
as like maybe i'll sell it one day
that's not an offering that's not an
invitation to like you have the
exclusive right of first refusal to to
buy something but i could understand how
the original violet's feelings could be
heard over this
i i even see math in it i anyway hold on
moving on you're the all the
reasons you've stated for this are
horrible
you are disadvantaging her because she
chose her career instead of having a
family i look i admittedly i'm playing
into op's head cannon
but i definitely
i mean if you have the option to sell a
property
within your family to somebody who's who
lives one to two hours away or somebody
that lives a four hour plane ride away
and also doesn't use it too much
it seems like you make the right thing
you made the right decision by
offering did not give it but like sell
it to the person who uses it more often
and can use it more often easily in the
future
rose is getting much more use out of the
apartment the fact that she has kids who
are also going helps in that favor she
lives closer visits more often keeps the
place more up more often the most
logical choice is rose it's fine that
violet chose to have her career and
that's wonderful but that's not the only
issue it would be illogical it's not
playing favorites it's literally
illogical i do agree
everyone else is focused on the wrong
things not the
have you considered the dibs though have
you considered the dib factor
you're the if both wanted it and
neither wanted to co-own it i would have
sold it to a stranger i do agree with
that
for sure
that's that's a good take in my opinion
but i am also like you know
it does sound like like the character
known as rose is using it much more
frequently and uh and as a result of
that i'm like uh you know maybe it was
better to not put it on the open market
it seems like rose has a sentimental
connection and is getting use out of it
with this handled i i suspect op is also
the reason her girls aren't close tell
me you're uh a psycho without telling me
you're a psycho i've read four sentences
about uh someone's life
hey you're the reason your daughters
don't talk even though they're
adults in their 40s
[Laughter]
please don't make such assumptions oh my
god they were in a fatal car crash that
killed their father when they were only
13 and 15.
their relationship has never healed from
these events
so knowing this you decided to sell your
apartment in this manner which could
only result in resentment especially
when you decided the one who had kids
was more deserving
oh my god
and they ratioed her that's the worst
part out of all this
81 posts you're a bad mom 82 posts
actually there was an indescribably bad
family trauma that happened
86 upvotes
don't care didn't ask plus you're old
that's that's insanity man
[Laughter]
don't care didn't ask plus your ratio
you fell off
all right well um
i think we got one more in us
actually i think we got two more in us
because the one that's two away looks
really good
hold up we'll go fast i promise okay
i just i i
wonder about these people that just go
into every discussion trying to win you
know
and the worst part about it is that i
think that if you spend too much time
online you think that that's what all
interactions are like and as a result
you then get infected with that
and you go through life thinking that
every interaction is you know there's a
winner and a loser and then it's just
like it spreads
like a like a
fungal colony or something
how about just like
i think you should have sold it to a
third party
but i can understand your reasons for
selling it to rose
instead it's like you're a bad mom
uh actually they
suffered something indescribably tragic
that forced them apart from one another
don't care didn't ask
shut up everyone who's a bad moms uh
give context bad moms give context
am i the for nagging my sister
into getting pregnant earlier
i'm 28 and my sister is 36. we've always
been close and on good terms
well until mom sells the vacation
apartment one thing that always annoyed
me we've always been close one thing
though that always annoyed me is that
she's the kind of person who believes in
the power of energy to the point where
she refuses to go to the hospital and
claims she can heal any illness she has
on her own the the roller coaster i was
like we've always been close she does
annoy me she believes in the power of
energy and she can heal disease with the
power of her mind okay fair enough
i think she's lucky she's never faced
serious medical issues visibly so far
she's been married for six years they
wanted to enjoy life before having kids
he says he's ready but she refuses and
he's respecting her wishes
she says she's
he says he's ready but she refuses and
he's respecting her wishes she says
she's ready now
oh okay but she communicated with her
spiritual guides
who told her to start having children
when she is 44. they said four kids so
she might be having kids well into her
50s if that's even possible
that's a that's a prickly situation
i know that it's better for women to get
pregnant before 40 we know how many
people who had kids in their 40s and
those kids had serious issues you sure
okay that's not like anecdote is not uh
data but i understand what you're
getting that um
i mean even if it's biologically
possible i guess the risk of a high-risk
pregnancy goes up
every time she brings up this weird plan
of hers
aptly described i suppose
i tell her she's being reckless and
isn't taking into account the serious
risks she doesn't listen to me and is
stubborn in her thinking
thinking yet she keeps bringing it up
around me two weeks ago i was talking
with them at a family gathering and she
brought up her weird pregnancy plan
i told her she was being unrealistic and
once again pointed out we don't okay yes
yes yes she said it's because they
lacked the connection she had with the
spiritual realm i replied with something
along the lines of you're an idiot and
then turned to her husband and said i
hope you have a good excuse ready for
your kids for going along with this
nonsense she's been upset since then
it's the first time she actually got
upset about my reaction
she refuses to talk to me and i know for
my brother that her and her husband are
fighting about this issue even today my
brother and others in the family think i
was an for what i said even
though all of them are also against her
pregnancy plan yeah that's um
look i i feel like this is
this is a classic example of
you're the you're the but also
you're right
this happens from time to time you know
great idea in delicate execution
i think that
sometimes this is a situation where i
think
it well you i wouldn't even say that
she's being an to be honest i
would say she's being impolite
and she's
breaching social norms for sure
but this is not like you know
disagreeing with somebody
uh on something trivial and then being
like you you know whole grain
tostitos are better than white corn
tostitos
this is a situation that potentially has
like serious long-term health
ramifications right
so even though it's an move it's
about a it's about a very serious issue
and i think it comes from a place of uh
of care about her sister and her
sister's family and she just seems
concerned to me i say not the
i'm not even i don't need to look at the
comments i already know what they look
like this is what i wanted to see oh my
god they they just keep getting better
am i the for getting pissed at
my gf for spam calling me at 3am after
clubbing when i was asleep
am i the for not shutting up at
4am
am i the for telling my
mother-in-law it's inappropriate to
bring something up i did as a team to
embarrass me in my own shower
am i the for shutting my wife
out of the blender buying process
there's a lot of good stuff there man
this is our hard stop though okay
i know i got it i gotta read the blender
one
a little context i have a hard time
sleeping i've recently fallen into a
good sleeping routine meaning i've been
falling asleep at 9pm to 11pm which is
usually unheard of for me respect i'm a
borderline insomniac when i wake up out
of sleep it's hard for me to return to
sleep and my girlfriend knows this she
also knew i would be asleep because she
checks snap maps constantly to see when
i was last on plus i hadn't replied to
any of her snaps in hours which i don't
usually do can somebody in chat tell me
what the this means
she checks snap map
snap maps constantly to see when i was
last on plus i hadn't replied to any of
her snaps and hours which i don't
usually do
snapchat snap
maps
are posts that are geotagged so it
checks your location
is that is that correct
not really but yes
okay
you can just do that
[Laughter]
you have to you have to enable it
oh okay that's crazy man
snap
chat snap maps
you have to disable it
it's enabled by default
oh my god
people are worried about the damn
vaccine
you could check on your boyfriend's snap
map on snapchat and see oh don't worry
about him he's asleep
look he's got a little pip in his house
here that's crazy man
um
anyway
eddie
oh okay
we weren't even at oh the edit comes in
the middle it's an edit in media res
by spam call i mean she had rang me two
times prior i hadn't woken up for the
third call woke me up she spam calls me
at 3am walking home alone from the club
when she feels unsafe okay you're the
kind of
let's go further but like the word
unsafe definitely uh
it does a lot of heavy lifting there
furthermore she also okay well
she feels unsafe and wants to talk to me
on the way back despite knowing about my
sleep issues okay like
would i be annoyed yes
for sure
and i don't think the boyfriend as so
far has done anything wrong
at all like i don't think he's
like he goes to sleep she's at the club
who cares
right
i would be annoyed but if she's like i
don't feel safe please talk to me right
now
you gotta you gotta do the conversation
or break up with her
those are your two options
furthermore she also knew i had to be up
early to get a train home from my
university that she didn't take any
notice of she asks if i'm angry with her
i reply yes because she's walking home
alone when she had the option to go home
with a friend which would have been
safer she didn't want to stay an extra
hour so she left early on her own and
because i'm awake it's going to take me
a very long time to get to sleep again i
said it was selfish of her and she had
little concern for me i also find the
lack of care for her safety a big issue
because it's a 34 40 minute walk home in
complete darkness that's all very fair
i gotta say he pulled me back a little
bit
he
he's not he's not on the moral high
ground
for being
super pissed about being woken up
but being like hey if you had planned
properly you could have just taken a cab
home or something
you like you put yourself in this
situation and it's inconsiderate of you
that makes sense to me yeah i can see
that
by the way great time to have this
discussion is at like three in the
morning when one party is sober and the
other party is probably intoxicated but
anyway
uh we get into an argument on the phone
as she's walking back and she's accusing
me of not caring enough for her and says
that i'm in the wrong for being mad if
it was an actual emergency or something
bad was happening i wouldn't have minded
this i think you don't really know until
that happens though like
so if she had phoned have been like i'm
actively being killed right now
could you help me he would be like oh
gladly
no problem
[Laughter]
i wouldn't mind it but it's more the
fact she knowingly took an extremely
risky walk home when she could have
gotten home a safer way but chose not to
it took me around two hours to sleep
afterwards so i was even more upset
after the phone call it ended
i i mean i could i'm gonna be honest
came into this thinking
could be the
definitely uh
left this feeling like
he's not the in my opinion
be not because
he was justified in getting angry
at being called
and woken up but in my opinion justified
because she didn't
plan for a situation in which she
wouldn't have to call him
that's my take on the subject
i know it seems it seems
subtle
but instead of being like you know
don't call me
unless you're being killed which is kind
of the way it it's phrased i think it's
more like hey
is very inconsiderate of you to well i
don't know because now i'm like
i don't want to go so far as to say she
put herself in a position where she
would need to call him because that's a
little bit up to begin with but
at the same time i am like if if she had
planned better she could have just
gotten home in a more safe manner than
walking home through the darkness for
three quarters of an hour
um
i mean i would be annoyed i guess that's
why i'm i'm putting myself on the
mindset that i would be annoyed too
sleeping issues uh notwithstanding
i i don't even see it as in everybody
sucks here like i'm i'm not even
i'm not even willing to to say that he's
like why would he suck in this situation
i guess from her perspective
it would suck to be like hey i'm scared
and he was like
you didn't plan effectively
to not be scared click right like
that if you're in her
mindset
you you would be like
you know well
i guess you don't care about me
i don't know if he hung up
but still
but i'm also like you know
could you have planned to take a taxi or
something yeah also why is
if you're going to bed at 9pm your
girlfriend's going out clubbing at 3 a.m
look if it happens now and then there'd
be diff opposites attract etc etc but
like that seems like a bad fit
just from the outside looking in i'm not
saying break up because i don't know
anything more about the situation but it
definitely seems like i will you know
you're gonna end up in situations like
this
he had an early appointment no i'm
taking his side i think going to bed at
9 00 pm is is highly based
[Laughter]
although they do seem to be young based
on all this nomenclature i've never
heard of like snap maps snapchats
snap map snapchat
okay i mean i got an dude i'm going down
to the blender i i know i shouldn't be
doing this forever but i mean apparently
i am i'll just be better at the
crosswords am i the for not
shutting up at 4 am in real time
i'm 27 f on my way to meet up with my
family on a trip
since i was in a wedding i couldn't
drive up with them and decided to take a
series of buses to catch up with them
i started at 10 pm and would arrive at 8
am i don't know what you're talking
about i don't understand this this this
is happening live right now it's being
updated every
every 10 minutes
after getting off the first bus we were
dropped at a gas station with a small
waiting room designated for the bus
company when we arrived there was a lady
in her dog sleeping and it sprawled out
so no one else could get in consequently
the rest of us
waited outside at 2 30 a.m for 40
minutes for the next bus to come when it
arrives the lady gets on the bus and
says she missed the last one's been
waiting 15 hours for this new one she
and her dog head to the back at the next
transfer we get by on a smaller bus and
my seat mate starts talking to me i love
practicing spanish so while we were in
the rest area we were chatting as soon
as we start driving dog lady comes up
and says i know you guys were excited to
talk to each other but it's four in the
morning i'm trying to get some sleep
i've been waiting for this bus all day
and i'm tired you need to stop talking
we honestly were not talking loudly but
i guess she needs absolute silence i
politely said that we would need we
would be as quiet as possible but this
was public transportation there's no
rule every passenger had to be silent
she threw a fit and talked to the bus
driver am i the for not going
completely silent i think i might be
because this is the time when people
generally sleep
it's the easiest everybody sucks here of
all time
well actually no you're the
yeah like it is
i feel like they did some sneaky
rhetorical stuff right like you you i
think maybe not everybody agrees with me
but i feel like it's good to be able to
learn how to spot this like you he
she i should say they did identify up
here um
she
left a sentence in here that primed us
there's a small waiting room when we
arrived there was a lady and her dog
sleeping in it sprawled out so no one
else could get in consequently the rest
of us waited outside at 2 30 a.m
this is
contextual
it does provide some preamble
but it also makes us predisposed to uh
not
like she's already the villain in our
story
just as a result of this so we can't
possibly if we read this you know the
first time through we can't possibly
have a fair assessment of uh her
character once the actual buildup starts
happening here
so yeah it's poisoning the well it's a
it's an inconsiderate move to be
sleeping at the front of the door
it does also sound like she was
tired man she said she'd been waiting
uh 15 hours for the next bus
now
ignoring this
i'm
should you be able to
practice your spanish on a bus at 4 a.m
no
you should be
like in prison for like a day
there's there's rules of decorum maybe
unspoken unwritten rules it's the same
thing if you're on an airplane
when the if if you're flying like you
know across the international date line
or you're flying
you know across the prime meridian or
something when they turn the lights off
you shut the up
you can whisper a little bit you know
and people have got headphones on and
stuff like that but even though it's a
it's a public place there's like rules
of
decorum for how you have to interact
with your around when you're around
other people you know i i think that
this happened to me once i i stayed at a
hostel like 10 years ago
and uh
one guy when he woke up in the you know
you're sleeping like six or eight people
to a room just in bunk beds and he he
woke up at like 7 a.m and just started
watching
like soccer clips on youtube with the
computer speakers on
and you're just like what are you
well it's uh hey if you're sharing a
room with other people of course you're
gonna have to deal with noise right hey
why don't you just have noise cancelling
headphones or something like that or
you know it it
there's like it's a situation
i mean is it everyone's like it's public
transportation
it might be i don't know even if it is
public transportation if if there's like
24-hour bus service and you're on a bus
at like 5 a.m and you're having a
conversation at a normal volume you're
kind of an i think
i i hate to say it but you know i've
been a night owl in my life
and even when i was i still had this
opinion
but
you know but between the hours of like
10 p.m and
you know 7 a.m
you just kind of chill that's when the
earth is
as quiet as possible
in order to make sure that everybody
else around you can also do what they
need to do
that's my take on it at least
i think you would it's the same
okay well what if there's a baby crying
on the on the airplane or there's a baby
crying on the bus i'm trying to sleep
okay whatever get some headphones
you it's a public plane
you're on a public plane right now
there's there's 300 people around you
and you expected enough silence for you
to sleep that seems like you're the
no they should make a a plane for babies
only only only an airline for babies
anyway i just wanted an excuse to tell
the hostile story anyway i don't think
everybody sucks well i don't know she
does kind of suck for falling asleep
next to the door
[Laughter]
i that's kind of a move um but
also i feel like carrying on a
conversation 4am on a bus is
you know maybe i'm i have too much of uh
it sounds selfish but it's actually like
the opposite you know because you
they're probably thinking oh it's the
lady's interest
in her not being able to sleep versus
our interest in having a conversation
but if you're annoying one person you're
probably annoying like
most people
it's just that one person had the
the cojones to actually like confront
you and say something whereas everybody
else was like i'll just be mad about it
but i think that uh
you know it's your your desire to have a
conversation in whatever and it's
different depending on the time of day
if it's you know 2 p.m and people work
different shifts but this is just
the unwritten rules of society as i see
it if it's 2pm
and you know you're on a public bus and
you're trying to get some sleep and uh
well it doesn't even seem like a public
bus either it seems like a greyhound
situation which kind of changes things
anyway
if it's 2pm and you're like hey can you
shut up i'm trying to sleep you just
give her the middle finger and say you
know it's a free country if it's a.m
you know your desire to practice your
spanish is very secondary to the people
around you having a peaceful environment
that's my two cents
night planes are for sleeping night
buses are for sleeping
you may disagree with me on this just
download duolingo what you don't have a
phone but you expect her to get noise
cancelling headphones
okay we gotta go to the blender
everybody sucks here on a
blender situation
you guys don't have phones
well you can practice uh spanish at 4am
in your own uh
in your own house because when it's your
own house it's your own rules
so i can wake up somebody for snoring on
a bus if i'm trying to sleep look okay i
know i get it you're a redditor um
there's also there's a spectrum you have
to consider of things that are optional
and things that are not optional okay
things that you have like some control
over things that you don't have control
over if somebody's sleeping they don't
have as much control over the fact that
you're snoring you might choose to just
you know eat on that one and still
try to fall asleep even though they're
snoring if somebody's wide awake and
banging a bunch of crash cymbals
together
they're both disturbing
but one of them is substantially more
ruder and and much more ignorant
it's the same reason
like when a uh when a baby cries you can
be annoyed but you're also like it's a
baby
and when uh
like a 35 year old dude starts just
shouting about politics on the flight
you're like i wish that guy was shut the
 up because we've got the same uh
intellectual capabilities and he's being
a real piece of garbage right now
what song is that i've had it stuck in
my head for a while
i think it's one of the
it's from final fantasy
i think it's i think it's the juno theme
the junon theme yeah see
i don't know why i just popped into my
head so well
i had to think of a march and i was like
yeah yeah final fantasy 7 june on march
okay
hi everybody i was hoping for some input
from this community that i've seen on
all a few times i'm a 39 year old man
and my wife is a 33 year old woman chad
that's not
i know what you're gonna say i
55 year old man and my wife 19 female
that's not that crazy okay
unless they say they've been married for
15 years
she stays at home and takes care of the
house no children yet well i work we're
going on seven years of marriage
last week i received a large performance
bonus and i decided i would like to buy
myself a nice blender with a small
portion of the money i know it's not the
most exciting present to buy yourself
but i cook with a lot of purees and have
a shake every morning i've had two
blenders die on me in the past three
years and was determined to make my life
easier
seeing as it was a financial decision i
told my wife as much and she told me to
show her before i ordered it
very tim robinson type type bit here huh
i know it's not the most exciting
present to buy yourself but i cook with
a lot of purees
okay sorry
i researched a bunch of different models
shopped around checked out safety
checked out safety ratings
is that a common um
you don't you don't hear that much about
blender accidents these days i don't
know if that happens uh
that doesn't mean that they don't happen
i guess just because you don't maybe
they happen so much they don't even
report them in the news because people
are just like ah another blender
accident what else is new water's wet
i found the one i wanted for just under
six hundred dollars i called my wife to
my computer where i showed her the model
that i wanted and was mainly just
confirming she was fine with it she
immediately responded by pointing at the
suggested items list on the website
which showed a significantly cheaper
model she asked what i thought of that
one and i said it wasn't what i was
looking for
i mean that's a pricey blender don't get
me wrong
you got a large performance bonus and
hey hey
the man
he has a a shake every morning
and he cooks a lot with purees
i mean
this seems like a guy if he has if he
literally has a shake every morning and
cooks with purees we're talking about it
he's using it maybe 400 500 times a year
that seems
like you know by the gold standard in
that case
i've used the blender like less than 10
times i think in my whole life
then she said i should get a nice hand
mixer to save some money i kind of
chuckled and said that i didn't really
want one of those
she replied with well how about this
blender it's 500 cheaper than the one
you close i mean the hand mixer is a
joke like does she even know
sounds like she's dabbling in an avenue
that she doesn't she doesn't have gps
coordinates to
you want this guy to make a
a shake with ice cubes in a hand mixer
are you crazy
clearly she doesn't work at bon appetit
i reiterated i was really looking for a
good one that i could use for over a
decade but she was undeterred she
essentially took over my computer then
began the race to the bottom of finding
the cheapest possible blender as i stood
by repeating the same point about being
in the market for a quality product
at one point she went on alibaba showing
me an 11 product that would probably
take a month to ship okay come on
lady that's just you
he he came up with a 600 blender you're
over here on wish.com trying to get the
cheapest the the bargain
i was at my limit so i finally just said
i think about it she left the room and i
ordered the 600 blender based i figured
when the blender got to our house i'd
explain
you know what he should have done is
just been like oh i found this on
alibaba for ten dollars
yeah you wouldn't believe it i just did
a little bit more digging
and then look i found the exact same one
on alibaba for 1 60th of the price
two days later it arrived she asked me
how much it cost
and i said it was the one i'd shown her
she began sulking and said i didn't care
about her opinion to which i responded i
told her i'd think about it then she
asked when i ordered it i responded
about three minutes after she left the
room
it's the
 double g
she left the oh okay i thought about it
in those minutes and made the decision
i'd put half a dozen hours of research
into this is like how my dad buys stuff
he will he'll research like four dining
room chairs for like eight months
just when i when i go
like to my parents house if i'm there
for a week every every day my dad will
be on like uh
overstock.com
furniture
reviews.ca like he he every single
purchase that he makes he he percolates
on it for like at least six months
she's furious with me and keeps
repeating that i has no
it's got to be that she has no financial
power in the house right
she's furious with me now and keeps
repeating that i has no financial i can
has no financial power in the house
i think she's being completely dramatic
but she thinks i'm way out of line any
input on who's right about this would be
great okay two things that i
not the 58 everybody sucks here
20
okay i gotta work on this screen region
i i agree
not the
i definitely don't think it's everybody
sucks here
because the guy is not an but i
will also i i think this is a no
okay what's the percentage on that two
percent
that being said now i'm like
nah she's kind of being an but
she's kind of being an but i i
understand where she's coming from
works from home
doesn't make the money
maybe she she's looking for some kind of
way to exercise a little bit of control
over the you know
financial spending of the household
right she she doesn't have the
based on what is written here it seems
like she doesn't have the means to uh
you know do it herself so maybe she just
wanted to be like hey i'm gonna you know
be part of the blender process
that's dude that's a genius idea
malicious compliance
he should have bought
the 600 blender
and the 11 blender
is my phone falling out of my pocket
again
it would have only cost
11 extra dollars
which is not that much when you're
already spending 600 and then he could
be like look at this i got the
i got the blender you wanted me to get
oh man
genius
yeah and then he could have put the 11
blender
into the 600 blender turned it on
watched it get vaporized and then said
that's why you don't buy an 11 blender
but yeah i don't think i mean this is
just a minor little conflict man this is
not that big of a it's not that big of a
deal let's go see what kind of what the
most insane people on the internet think
about it
i i personally am predicting
uh that there will be some kind of a
comment from someone that's about 16
years old that will be like if she's
like this about a blender imagine what
she's gonna be like when you have
children do you really want that in your
future someone who doesn't respect you
at all
everybody sucks here hope you realize
the fight's much bigger than just about
the blender she feels like she doesn't
have any power i suggest you find a good
marriage counselor and do not have kids
until you figure out if you can resolve
this okay
look
that's not quite the exact comment i
said but
if you've ever had a spat
with your spouse
over something as small as a blender do
not have kids
i think it's a little uh reductive
a little bit of a red flag that you guys
disagree on something everybody sucks
here regardless of whether 600 bucks is
too much to spend you shouldn't have
told her you'd think about it when you'd
already thought about it hey it's just
being polite
you lied to her
when you said all think about it when
you were not intending to think about it
you
he's just being polite
i just two questions does your wife
manage the finance
too does she have access to all the bank
accounts or is she on some kind of
allowance system hey before i weigh in
on this blender argument um
do you give your wife an allowance
what i'm trying to get is what kind of
underlying tensions or resentments there
may be around money she made a
significant statement about feeling
powerless which you dismissed casually
without a second thought
okay i do think that's kind of fair
oh man
people are not being that rude
not the sounds like you bought a
vitamix that's what people in chat were
saying they were like
he could be the unless it's a
vitamix because those things are like
those things will last forever
given your stupid wife pointed out that
you'd get a hand mixer it's quite clear
she has no clue about your blender needs
that is pretty funny also true though i
mean come on a hand mixer
are you stupid
to be fair she didn't care about your
opinion either and disagreeing about an
opinion is not considered not caring
it's called having your own opinion not
the it's your money
not the big financial decisions
should be joint
sure
however you said earlier as a small
performance of your performance a small
portion of your performance budget
personally i think if you're working
hard at your job and get money as a
reward you should be justified in taking
some of that money to treat yourself as
you see fit as long as other expenses
are covered which i assume they are it's
great you asked her opinion she didn't
really okay i mean that's all very
reasonable get to the insanity please
please i'm i'm begging you get to the
unreasonability
i love these info requests they seem so
demanding info
is she a housewife due to it being
something you both wanted out of
marriage something she primarily wanted
something you primarily wanted or a
force of circumstance fact
which bear is best
info does she ever get to spend 600 on a
personal item like this info does she
feel free to spend a bunch of money like
this or do you pressure her to think of
saving money when she wants to make big
purchases
okay this was not as spicy as i thought
it would
especially if he's getting the vitamix
wow
59 upvotes i'm just here to say
i'm just here to know what the actual f
someone does all day
looking after the house get a job add to
the finances and then you get a say in
how they're spent
all right look
info how big is your house
info do you have a pool
in
info is this really relevant to the
situation at hand
i will say i mean if we're using this as
like a bit of a teachable moment like
there was def as like a you know 15 year
old kid
if there was a situation where like the
father went to work and the mom stayed
at home
taking care of the house and also the
kids i definitely had a bias where i was
like oh she's got it easier i'm not
saying that's what i think now i'm
saying that's what i thought when i was
a teenager
now that i have a child and have worked
in some more traditional environments
obviously this is an atypical gig right
here um
i kind of feel like the dad in a lot of
situations gets off easy
you know
when you go to work for it depends on
the job but you know working in an
office
you you know if you're there for eight
hours some days you do like an hour and
a half of work and you're just kind of
chilling
and also looking after the kids is
exhausting you know like we have one
baby
daughter
and sometimes my wife and i will be like
you know hey can you look after
her for 10 minutes i need a break
and then we do with the break is we like
vacuum
[Laughter]
it's not like oh i need a break so i can
like go outside and get some leisure
time it's literally just like please
just give me like a psychological like
tolerance break to return to normalcy
for a bit and then come back with a
fresh mind
no i get that they don't have kids yet
and i i do then look at it and i'm like
you know
i'm not gonna say she doesn't do
anything with their time i'm i'm basing
it all on the marge simpson episode of
uh the simpsons where she starts
drinking a glass of wine a day
as a habit because she's bored with the
house that looks after itself i know the
doctors say you should drink a glass and
a half but i just can't drink that much
but anyway that's not that relevant to
the blender situation man
you think he's really going to be like
oh i'm going to buy whatever blender i
want because you just watched the view
all day that's not a healthy situation
man
i am a stay at home wife so i can answer
i deal with everything around the house
and repair appointments i also mow it
means i deal with dog vet appointments
his one consistent chore is
laundry he wears a uniform and i refuse
to deal with it because of reasons that
i won't list here
i'm not taken aside it does seem like
another thing you might do during the
day is post
a four paragraph reply
on reddit but
it isn't a 40 hour a job week but it's
still a job that needs to get done
that's true that is true
also our dogs are older and one has an
immune issue okay sure we have joint
finances and go over our budget together
you guys should try to stay within your
budget together i thought that was the
point i'm this is punching down get hey
get out of here it's
it's a honey trap for me it's it's i'm
getting too snippy there's no need for
that there's no need for that
okay anyway let's do some crosswords
this was good this was good reacts
it was a vitamix okay



back with the react court it has been
two weeks which is crazy um
there's there's been a lot of uh strife
in the world there's been a lot of
situations right for a little debate on
the internet who's who's in the right
who's in the wrong you know i'm i'm
ready to be back here everyone's saying
you you're the [ __ ] what just because
i took a vacation with my baby am i the
[ __ ] for taking a vacation with my
baby
i don't think so uh our second reacts
court uh of the week here might be
we want plates which i believe
is a subreddit for being served things
in restaurants in bizarre ways like the
the classic example i always think of is
this there was this restaurant in the
bay area that went viral um for the
wrong reasons because they served you
your meal on like an ipad
like uh
on a powered down apple tablet
anyway we'll see um but for now let's
let's just go look through uh am i the
[ __ ] am i the [ __ ] for giving a
girl a ride to a party but not home from
it she said i stranded her
i i do want to say i have no respect
for the post that and this is all of
them that makes it look like
um
there's no way they couldn't be the
[ __ ] and then they're obviously or
there's no way they could be the
anything but the [ __ ] and then
they're clearly actually just being nice
but anyway here we go
am i the [ __ ] for giving a girl a
ride to a party but not home from it
i was going to a friend's afternoon
garden party at her house
tell me um you're part of the one
percent without telling me you're part
of the one percent my plan was to drive
there stay at the party for a while then
afterwards meet up for a date at a
brewery near my friend's house then
potentially stay over at my dates place
which was close to my friend's house or
get an uber home but not drive my car
after i've been drinking this is written
by a streamer
you know how i can tell
no rational person would have raked them
over the coals and assumed that their
plan was drunk driving most rational
people would have given them the benefit
of the doubt but instead
they're baking like every possible bad
faith assumption and counter argument
into the statement so instead of just
being able to say
my plan was to take an uber back they
have to go through all the rationale and
reasoning to be above criticism but
anyway
when i was about to go to the party i
mentioned i'd be driving there and
bringing a car full of firewood in group
chat
a girl who's a friend of a friend asked
me if she could get a ride to the party
she was coming from the same area as me
i said sure we went to the party we
didn't really hang out at the party i
was talking to other friends that night
i left the party leaving my car parked
near my friend's house to go on the date
it went well i went to her house which
was close by for the night quit bragging
man
quit bragging
what i didn't know was the girl i'd
driven to the party was waiting for me
to be ready to leave thinking i was
still at the party and would be driving
home that night she thought that because
we'd come together we'd also leave
together she texted a few times but i
didn't see the texts she was also
looking for me and asking other people
if they'd seen me
but the people she happened to ask
didn't know me well and didn't know that
i'd left can i tell you
right now
this is totally fine just bad
communication she should have asked
don't get me wrong but i i don't think
it's unreasonable
for her to assume that she's also
getting a ride home from the person who
gave her a ride there that's that's just
the communication mishap now i'm
deliberately not reading any further
ahead
do you think
that in the next four paragraphs it's
all gonna fall apart
you don't don't comment if you've read
further ahead but it
so many of these are like 75 of the way
just normal human communication errors
happen all the time then it's she she
told my friend that
she got abandoned at the party and was
forced to sleep in the woods and now
nobody will talk to me anymore
the next morning i saw her text i texted
her back to say sorry i missed her
messages i hadn't been going back that
way last night anyway though she sent me
an upset message saying someone you
don't you don't just give someone a lift
40 minutes from home and then not drive
them home stranding them late at night
you can't push lunch
you just can't
whose bag is this
i almost tripped on it
i said i didn't realize she was also
asking for a lift home then he's like
that'll be 30 bucks and everybody
clapped um i thought when she asked me
for a lift there she literally just
meant a lift to get there if she said
there and back i would have said i
couldn't promise that i wasn't sure i'd
be going back that way she said i was
being deliberately stupid
it honestly didn't occur to me like i
feel it's presumptive to assume am i the
[ __ ] for driving another girl to a
party but not home um
this is
you're the [ __ ] for making this post
and it's the top post um
of am i the [ __ ] filter this week for
for the whole week this is as spicy as
it got
this i don't even think this is an
everybody sucks here i think this is a
no [ __ ] situation but they're both
they both made one critical mistake look
i putting myself in the shoes of the
girl
i i would assume i would definitely also
ask
but i would assume
that it's a package deal
i mean if you're driving like 40 minutes
away there is no point during the 40
minutes where you couldn't have been
like
hey are you coming back as well like or
you know can i also get a drive back and
then you know even if he said no at
least you would then be able to plan
around it but um the fact that they
didn't talk about it over the course of
the entire drive is kind of baffling to
me but i can understand why she would
assume
that she would also be getting a drive
back because i mean when you're going 40
minutes away you you i mean i'm not
saying she's he's beholden to her but
you would assume that maybe like that's
the easiest way the most frictionless
way for it to happen um
but then also from ops perspective i
mean i do think it's a little
stem lordy i i don't know if that's the
terminology i would use given more time
but it's a little stem lordy to be like
well
you merely asked for a ride there
which i
complied with you never said anything
about the ride back and that omission i
will just say you honey you reap what
you sow
that being said they are also right so
i think uh
i i think this is just literally like
look it's no fun if i just say
everybody's okay here who who
who has 51 of the blame for the
situation
the passenger
absolutely in my opinion
is i think it's on the passenger to
control
the to be in control of their own
well-being in that sense you know you
got to figure out like you don't just
go to the air airline counter and be
like one ticket to new york and then
show up at the airport like uh on your
for your return trip that you don't even
have a ticket for
and be like well what the heck i gotta
buy a second ticket now you you gotta
you gotta be in charge of your own
itinerary there but i don't know this
one's honestly just kind of boring if
i'm being straight up with you i think
that yes just the fact that you've
you've posted it is like
i mean i i i just consider it unworthy
of even a post
there's got to be something better how
about this one hold on you i don't know
if you can hear tomorrow beating down my
door
come on well welcome welcome
i don't think that the word
ride implies that it's there and back
i do think that's an that's the
assumption i would make but i don't
think there's an implication there
necessarily
am i the [ __ ]
hold on hold on
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting our son
to bring women into our house in the
middle of the night oh no
um
let's see
this one this one definitely seems a
little spicier
arguments are horrific
that's just it i don't know why does it
start like uh like a song by the
national or something
arguments are horrific the arguments
arise regarding our oldest son 25 and
his refusal to adhere to a rule that
neither his long time short-term
temporary etc girlfriends are allowed to
come in our house in the middle of the
night it's a simple rule no girls in our
house without our knowledge in the
middle of the night that is not a simple
rule okay
because i the the first thing i want to
ask is what is the middle of the night
you know
if he's if he's bringing a girlfriend
over
at like
8 30 and you go to bed at eight like
what are you supposed to do
if if it's like three a.m
then we can start to talk but like okay
let's take a look tomo i i love you man
i love you
could you could you just back it up a
little bit just back it up
unfortunately our 25 year old son can he
continues to flaunt his our sexy hunk
son continues to flaunt this rule hey
mom and dad
i'm not just gonna bang this girl in the
bushes like you want i'm gonna go home
to my my safe warm bed
instead of finding a porta potty
somewhere
we have outdoor security cameras and we
are able to see him sneak his
girlfriends he keeps using etc i don't
know
i don't know why he's being so weird
about it
able to see him sneak his girlfriends
etc in and out of the house at all hours
of the night
as background this issue came ahead a
number of years ago we told our son his
longtime girlfriend could no longer come
upstairs after 10 p.m where we have our
family bedrooms two days after we
implemented this rule he was caught
breaking it he did it again a few years
later honest question dude are you
stupid
so the only interpretation that i think
it's possible to glean from this is that
the the son's bedroom is also upstairs
right
so they sleep on the same floor
but his girlfriend is not allowed
to also
come upstairs into his bedroom
after
uh after dark hold on this cat man
i love you tomo but why why do you want
the pets right now buddy oh just go into
the box there you go
oh and now he's gone
he's like i want some more
um
this is insane like this is is in my
opinion kind of almost an insane rule to
have for like uh
i mean i don't want to get too into the
issue i guess but even for like uh
you know a teenage child
to be like you're you know you can't
have your
your boyfriend or girlfriend upstairs
after 10
but uh a 25 year old is is well beyond
kind of the the bounds of absurdity
since then there are numerous
instances of girls we know and girls we
don't know that come and go into our
home in all hours of the night the
latest occurred with this long-term
girlfriend
being snuck into the house at 5 30 and
leaving before the house awakened the
security cameras caught them purposely
trying to be avoided
i i feel like i need to raise another
concern here uh which is if the only way
you can notice this stuff happening is
on the security cameras and no crimes
are being committed then who cares
[Laughter]
if if your 25 year old son snuck his
girlfriend in at 5 30 for like an hour
and a half and you only notice later
that day when you
poured over the security footage like a
psycho then then what's the big deal
my wife and i decided that even though
he was 25 he would have a curfew from 12
a.m to 7 a.m where by the way this is
not the [ __ ] is the is the flare here
i'm dying my wife and i decided that
even though he's 25 he would have a
curfew from 12am to 7am whereby he
either had to be home by midnight and
stay home or had to stay out until the
next morning
in addition to brining
that's not cool in addition to bringing
his girlfriends into the home it's very
disruptive when he's constantly coming
in and out at all hours of the night
look i can
uh
accept that it would be annoying to hear
someone entering and leaving your home
at all hours of the night i can actually
i can relate to and understand that but
you do also
have uh
a child like a an adult child living
with you
i feel like there's an element of like
that's kind of just life
like you can't mandate somebody's life
to the extent that they literally never
inconvenience you i think you
just have to accept that when you live
with other people especially when
they're family i mean you you could be
like hey keep it down but you can't be
like a uh you can't leave the house
between 12 a.m and 7 a.m
anyway my wife communicated
oh this curfew was a means to address
these issues and was created jointly
between my wife and i both both of the
parties involved
me and my wife who side on the same
issue and also i it's all my wife is
always capitalized which is truly
hilarious but um didn't even ask the
child okay my wife communicated this
curfew to him two days ago i refuse to
speak to him because he's bigger and
stronger than me um last night he came
home at 1 50 a.m i i didn't even talk
about the fact that
like and again i i am closer to the
son's age than the parents presumably i
hope um although the father does kind of
sound like a little kid
i don't you really want to have a a
curfew 12 a.m to 7 a.m so if your son
can't come home
by if he's like oh the uber's gonna get
me there at 12 30
then he's like i guess i'm just gonna go
sleep on the street like
that's not the
really good parenting in my world
it's like how how about like it's always
you know you've always got a safe place
here but please you know
be respectful i know it's like a perfect
world situation but
i'm just saying anyway
last night he came home at 1 50 a.m two
days after the new rule it was broken
he did call my wife to ask if he could
come home late and she agreed
so it sounds like he actually didn't
really break the rule it sounds like he
got uh
he got permission to break the rule
actually i told her that i was shocked
he would have the nerve to even ask two
days after breaking our only real rule
except for the other rule
this resulted in another huge argument
in that i feel like the lack of
retribution is the root cause of why he
keeps breaking the rule why wouldn't he
keep breaking the rule the only thing
that happens is my wife and i fight as a
result
the this guy's actually like my son hat
we've got to remove the safety net and
let my son hit rock bottom
this destructive habit of coming home
after midnight
and sleeping with his girlfriend in his
own bedroom is too much he's going down
a bad path
i feel it is fair and reasonable to not
allow our 25 year old son to bring his
girls to our home in the middle of the
night and while my wife agrees this
continues to happen and be a source of
arguments her perspective is that i have
it in for him and my perspective is
simple just show us the necessary
respect by doing exactly what i say at
all times and follow this pretty obvious
rule and also the other obvious rule i'm
being called the [ __ ] because i won't
let this issue go and it's a recurring
source of arguments as i feel as a lack
of respect which is fundamental and
shouldn't be let go how about the lack
of respect that you've got uh for your
adult son who was probably like the age
that you were when you had him in the
first place
my wife thinks i'm the [ __ ] for not
letting the issue go and for not waiting
until he eventually moves out i'm okay
i am dying
not the [ __ ] hold on you you can't
see
but i'm being completely sincere not the
[ __ ]
63
what
everybody sucks here 16
which i have to be honest i don't fully
agree with
you're the [ __ ] 10
i already know what the comments are
going to be but i am going to read them
you know as well as i do what it's going
to be we'll say it on three three two
one your house your rules even if you
told him he had the strip naked when he
comes in and get de-loused you know even
though he's an adult within a with
autonomy and you should have your son's
best interest in mind and you know etc
etc um if you pay the mortgage then
legally it's not you know you're the
jurisdiction you're the warden of the
prison et cetera et cetera
let's uh let's let's see what they say
here
oh yeah also maybe a little jealousy
because it sounds like the sun is just
laying pipe 24 7.
you know what not the [ __ ]
that
serves him right if you're gonna [ __ ]
you're gonna [ __ ] in the daytime mister
freaking
sexy hunk hold on i'm trying to figure
out how to open this post
how do you how do you open a post man oh
there we go i got it all right
um
okay let's let's learn together okay
hey i'm all for different perspectives
man let's see let's see what we get
not the [ __ ] but you need to enforce
these rules hold on
tell me more about this part
not the [ __ ] but you need to enforce
these rules you either need to start
being a boner killer and banging on his
bedroom door when he brings these women
home uh but that you that would require
the father to wake up when it actually
happens instead of merely pouring over
the security footage like a [ __ ]
psycho the next day or you can put an
extra set of deadbolts on the door that
get locked at midnight and unlocked at
7am holy crap you guys are insane
anybody else lock their son out of their
house because i don't like when he stays
out a little bit late i don't get me
wrong like
someone coming home at 4 00 a.m like if
i woke up would be annoying for me
coming home at like 12 30 i would be
like he's 25.
he's 25 years old
also you should tell your wife that your
son is never actually gonna move out
how would you know this
at all you'd
why bother when he can do whatever he
wants whenever he wants with no
consequences and have someone to keep
the house clean are you do you this this
has to be an alt for
the op it's the only
i
i'm not even gonna get into the
economics of whatever just like
do you think the kid really like if he
had options he would be like oh i really
i love living at home and getting
harassed by my dad for like going to bed
at 1am even though i'm an adult um
i'm also i don't know if this was like
edited or something but
the kid's 25 years old has no job
accused his dad of having it out for him
when he was told to get a job and pays
no rent like none of that is actually
located in the post maybe that was
edited later i don't know
it sounds like he made that up
op at some point you need to kick him
out
just hold on just
everybody sucks here your son is the
[ __ ] for not respecting the rules of
your house however you and your wife are
as well for allowing it to continue for
so long i am
i am dying
that
there is
only two parent comments in here but i
am dying that nobody has said your rules
are have
are ridiculous and have gone too far and
instead everybody else is just like
you're the [ __ ] for not enforcing
your totally sensible rules
not the [ __ ] why are you coddling a
man in his mid-20s by allowing him to
sleep in his bedroom uh when he pleases
and apparently doesn't even
like wake you up you got to see the
security footage after
i got the impression this is more about
them not wanting to be awoken by the
sound of ham slaps more than trying to
coddle their son
so good
damn slaps
not the [ __ ] it's not his house it's
yours if he wants to do whatever he
wants then he could just buy his own he
can just buy his own house he's the
[ __ ] not you he's being disrespectful
by not listening to you
holy crap man this is this is crazy yeah
i don't know why and i i don't think
this is i always default to the idea
that it's like an american thing and i
don't think that's fair
i'm just realizing homeowners have lost
their mind
as as one myself
i'm like look
i don't even make the rules in my own
house so maybe this is
this is just power for the course for me
to be a little bit lackadaisical about
it but i'm like when you have
like a kid
like you can say your house your rules
but at the same time like i feel like
the kind of parental love you have for
your son
has to
you know make it a little bit more
accommodating for that as well
oh my god
i'm baffled by him bringing home randoms
at all hours i moved back home at 26
after leaving an abusive relationship
and then stayed because my mom was
diagnosed with cancer and yet i it's
gonna be like i did whatever i i did
whatever they told me at all times
my parents knew i didn't have to be
there but i stayed to help we had one
rule if you're not going to be home by
the time we wake up text us so we won't
worry that's a good rule
that's actually a fantastic rule
if you're gonna be out late send us a
text that's like
i'll be home late don't stay up just go
to bed rather than wait
if i had sex i usually had it somewhere
else okay there were sometimes i had it
at home which completely invalidates the
point i was gonna make but usually i
followed the rule
usually i played by the standards that
i'm forcing on this stranger there were
times my boyfriend stayed with me when
my parents had gone
and i would never ever disrespect my
parents by having sex in their home
while they were there
is that an is this a rule as well that
i'm not the this is why you need uh a
notary public
you know if you pay the mortgage you're
the only person legally allowed to [ __ ]
in that house
please do not let the landlords figure
this out because it's going to be
written as a clause in the every lease
you're you really trying to [ __ ] in the
garage that i converted into an illegal
suite
no ham slabs allowed honey
this is insane i would never disrespect
my parents
by having sex in their home
comma while they were there
when they weren't there it was open
season man
24 7
certified freak
not the [ __ ] but isn't it a little
late to demand respect from your 25 year
old since he violates your rules every
chance he gets
do people i i can't believe i'm spending
like half an hour just on this one
specific post but it's the first am i
the [ __ ] post i've ever seen where i
disagree so much with the consensus
like this is this one's blowing me away
i think you gotta realize like there's
two
um reasons that someone might break your
rule okay
one of the rules is
uh one of the reasons someone might
break your rule is because they don't
have respect the other one might be that
your rule just is stupid
like
your rule might just actually suck and
you've designed it in such a way that
there's essentially no way to comply
with it
you know if you made a rule that was
like no eating
and then someone was like hey you know
12 hours later he was breaking it he
couldn't even make it a month
i mean it's
anyway
not the [ __ ] okay your house your
rules when he has a place he pays for he
can have his own rules sounds like he
needs a job and an apartment
thanks the come catcher
i do find this part weird or he had to
stay out until the next morning i'd
rather have my kid home if he's got
nowhere else to go like what's the point
of that what's the desired effect by the
way you're not the [ __ ] your house
your rules
if he wants to if he wants to break the
rules he can get his own [ __ ]
apartment he can pull himself up by his
bootstraps by the way this one part of
your post specifically i think makes you
an [ __ ] not the [ __ ] by the way
you're not an [ __ ] but
i agree with you a hundred percent
except for this one specific part that i
think makes you an [ __ ] but you're
not the [ __ ] okay hold on hold on
what's the point of this rule to not
affect people when they're sleep
it's very rude to come walking into
someone's home
someone in this case by the way being
your parents your life givers
um that late unless it was mentioned
beforehand plus he is 25 not 15
wherever he is he can stay until seven
i'm 21 my parents have the same rules
for me college student and doesn't pay
any bills
the self report at the end
not the [ __ ] and there's one solution
for this kick your son out of your house
that's that's the reading between the
lines not the [ __ ] even ordinary
roommates typically make agreements
about when and how often dates can be in
the house
look first year university first time i
ever lived with a roommate never
broached the conversation at all my
roommate had his girlfriend
come from out of the city to stay with
us our dorm room had two single beds
i was like as long as she sleeps in your
bed i'm not sweating it
big whoop
you know it's just assumed that you
you know it's
it's an accommodation you make when you
live with other people
second year university i lived with
seven uh well six other people never had
this conversation about you know
romantically who's allowed to come over
and how often
now were there some times maybe
in in third year where uh we were like
hey one of our housemates girlfriends
basically lives with us and yet he's
paying the normal amount of the utility
uh
share and as a result maybe he should be
paying you know two eighths instead of
one seventh we did we did consider that
at times however that's not that big of
a deal that's like a twenty dollar a
month difference probably overall
apart from that and we we
nobody really cared it was it was not
mouth we did i didn't ever live with
mouth
plus malf is very respectful info is he
paying rent hi he does not pay rent or
any house bills okay so this is where
some of the info came from
he's 25 years old kick him out this is
you're gonna make me cyber bully man
this is where you then go into their
post history and figure out what what
else they're posting
if they ever posted anything about the
economy being [ __ ] up or like minimum
wage being too low that's where you go
into the post history and you're like oh
really because you're advocating for
someone who's 25 years old to get kicked
out of their parents house just because
you're jealous that they're laying pipe
constantly
everybody's okay we finally found a post
that maybe we can find some common
ground with everybody sucks here you
can't give a 25 year old man a curfew
that's ridiculous we have found a human
being
that lives in
the real world at least
a little bit
you definitely cannot give a 25 year old
man a curfew if he's gonna live with you
then he needs to pay rent maybe okay
like it look you buy yourself some some
honey with this i don't necessarily
agree with that but it depends on the
situation i guess
at that point okay sure if he pays rent
then his visitors are his business
that's fair if he's waking you up and
causing a disturbance that's one thing
but you fixating on this rule is masking
the real problem this is very true
he's acting like a teenager and you're
treating him like one this is an
unhealthy cycle tell him he has one
month to get his act together and start
paying rent or move out you should make
him move into the basement room either
way to give you all some space this uh
honestly
this has made me a little bit
a little bit more amenable to that side
i do underst he has a little bit more
ability to say
he can do what he wants if he pays some
rent for sure i'm not saying he should
have to make
have to pay rent i also think that
forcing your 25 year old son to vacate
his bedroom to go live in the basement
is just it it's always a weird like
power flex right like it's like a prison
warden inmate situation
dude i'm dying of this stuff not the
[ __ ] it's your home your rules you
make the rules if he wants to make the
rules he needs his own place he needs to
grow grown up or and gtfo
of your house he's acting like a baby
i'm surprised oh oh woman
the air quotes don't even make any sense
would even date someone oh you know what
because here's what he's saying
any any
woman that would date somebody who
doesn't respect his father's curfew is
not a woman they're merely a girl
i understand that's what he's saying
there
by the way he's getting super entitled
and that isn't gonna change source dude
just trust me you should give him a
60-day notice to evict this will help
him grow up i know it works from
experience
a post that i read on the turning point
usa forums
holy [ __ ]
it's his home too minus 13 votes
[Laughter]
oh
no it isn't he doesn't even pay rent or
help with the bills
besides there's a pandemic bringing
strangers home is dangerous but not
between the hours of 7 a.m and midnight
that's when the virus sleeps
oh man what a what a post i mean i'm
that one
i got a lot of a lot of meat out of that
one
oh we finally have our first [ __ ]
post
oh no come on man
come on this one there's no way
yeah
am i the [ __ ] filter doesn't have it
only allows uh the judgment bot to
collate the results it doesn't show the
like people there don't talk about the
their reaction to it
am i the [ __ ] for assigning my family
homework and not visiting until it's
done
i recently quit my phd program to get a
job because i realized academia was not
what i wanted and i was better off just
using my master's to get a job everyone
i know from school
or has experience with grad school
agreed i'm doing the right thing because
i've only done one year of phd classes
so it's a good time to quit i've had
people tell me they wish they'd quit at
my level but they feel trapped now
because they're well into their
dissertations my family were not
understanding none of them have ever
been to grad school but they believe
that i was very far along and quitting
at the last minute
for context how long is a phd a a phd is
like another
it's four four plus years right
four to six years four to eight years
average length five to seven years okay
so so he quit like 20 it wasn't like he
was a year away so he was like at most
maybe like 25 percent of the way there
okay
um that that seems reasonable if you
decide it's not what you'd want to do at
the moment um
i told them one year of classes by the
uh no i'm not even gonna go there i was
gonna say maybe it matters more what
what they're doing but let's not even
get into that um
they believe i was very far along and
quitting at the last minute i told them
one year of classes is nothing but they
don't realize how hard the exam and
dissertation are uh i think i could get
them done they think i could get them
done if i just spent a little bit more
time i figured they wouldn't listen to
me but they might listen to someone else
i found an article written by a college
professor that describes what it's like
to get a phd in my field i told them i
would not visit until they read the
article and wrote a few paragraphs
summarizing the article and discussing
why someone would not choose to get
their phd hey um you know you ever hear
someone say that you can be very
accomplished in academics and still be
pretty dumb
i've been there
uh
look just finish the post before we
before we go off i guess there there
could be something to ameliorate this
um
it's not meant to be a long and
difficult project i just wanted them to
understand my point of view
one thing you need to know about human
beings is they love being assigned
homework especially uh like from their
child
and also
being railroaded into an
ultimatum uh where they your child
literally won't visit you until you
watch this anyway
my boyfriend and siblings did their
essays did their essays
and apologized and my boyfriend went
above and beyond by including other
sources besides the article that's
probably because you're dating another
nerd like yourself dummy
that's all you've been you've been in
school for
24 years you're 26 years old all you
know how to do is write essays he was
probably he probably got a big old nerd
boner for it
who who would have thought that your
boyfriend would you know
acquiesce to your ridiculous ultimatum
what what a ridiculous
what a surprise
um
my parents still haven't done their
essays and haven't apologized and still
complained that i'm throwing away all
the work i did am i the [ __ ] for
standing my ground and not visiting
until they do their homework
this is a a classic example of um
not such a horrible
idea but an absolutely disastrous
execution
[Laughter]
you're the [ __ ] but slightly based
yeah i would i would agree with that
um
they're they're
look okay so now this is the part of the
discourse where i then get myself into
trouble one thing i do want to know and
i i imagine that it's not the case
but are
the parents
did the parents pay for the education up
to this point that doesn't give them
ownership over what the child does with
their life but if the parents pay for
the first year of the phd program and
then i guess many phd programs are like
scholarship driven maybe i don't know
but
then i could understand why they might
be like hey you're quitting in a
situation
phds are usually funded okay well then
then disregard um
that that's fair enough but i could see
why in that case they might be like
you know we got to give this more
thought you also
like
the
are your parents maybe not seeing it
your way yeah but you said it yourself
like they never they've never been to
grad school you know like for
a large swath of the population perhaps
even myself included uh
the idea in your head is just like the
more school you go to the better your
job is at the end where i think the way
it actually works in some disciplines is
that if you get your phd you're kind of
gated into the academic pipeline
uh and if you just stick with your
masters i don't know maybe you could
work in like private industry or
something related in that sense so there
might also just be like a difference in
you know career path based on them but
your parents might not be aware of that
if they haven't been to grad school lord
knows i'm i'm barely aware of it and i i
didn't go to grad school but you know
many of my friends have their master's
degrees so i think i'm able to to chime
in here
um
i guess it depends on the field that's
fair but uh
you
the reason you're the [ __ ] is because
look if you're if if you're a parent you
might not want to hear this but part of
being
a
kid
is being annoyed by your parents now and
then
because they have a different
perspective on issues than you do and
you talk about it because you know if
you're trying to be a happy family
you just tolerate it because you
probably annoy the [ __ ] out of them in
other ways
like every time i talk to my mom
she's like have you have you guys gotten
your wills done yet and i'm always like
no and then she always like admonishes
me
and in my head i'm like we're [ __ ]
busy like all the time
it's like i know it's good to get done
it's on the list but it's one of those
things that's like important but not
urgent hopefully
um
so every time she she talks to me like i
can't believe like you lazy bones aren't
getting your wheels done
um and it's more for me i'm like every
single day we're like clawing and
scrapping for like 15 minutes of free
time right
um
but then simultaneously i also remember
that like you know when i was in college
i was probably annoying the crap out of
my mom
you know or even sometimes now she'll be
like hey if i'm driving somewhere she'll
be like you know like if we would go on
vacation last week she's like text me
when you get there and then like
seven hours later she's like oh did you
get there and i'm like oh yeah sorry i
forgot
so you know like you you you take the
good and the bad but you have
conversations about it
what i what i would be very upset with i
would probably get over it like pretty
quick but if my mom was like hey i'm not
gonna talk to you again until you watch
this 15-minute video about why it's
important to have a will and then like
write me a summary uh
of the video so that i know that you
watched it i would like that would put a
strain on our relationship i would find
it very disrespectful
and that's from
my parent down the child up is i think
even more of an uphill battle to some
extent even though they're an adult you
know they're probably not used to the
relationship going in that direction
right um
so yeah i would say you're the [ __ ]
um
i mean you could
link them the video
and be like hey
i would if you want to know where i
stand with this phd stuff this video
would help me like you know
under th this would help you come to an
understanding with me maybe and but in
or watch it with them or something like
that but instead
um you know being like i will not visit
you until you've done it i'm like whoa
geez somebody thinks she's super
important oh they're not going to come
over and ask me for money for six months
so that's going to be so hard for me
it's not fair you miss your kid don't
get me wrong but like i mean as long as
you're trying to bring a power dynamic
into this situation for no reason then
you know be careful is i guess what i'm
trying to say
anyway let's see
you're the [ __ ]
but i love you for it
i think that's fair
and this this is a joke tell them they
should apply themselves more and stick
with that's a joke i can laugh about
that i'm not humorless
everybody sucks here they may be
naive and are being rude about it but
you sound insufferable i wouldn't do an
assignment because someone in my family
demanded it and i actually like reading
and writing yes absolutely
i agree this is funny as hell everybody
sucks here
everybody sucks here
assigning homework is juvenile yeah okay
look people this is what me because in
the last post i was like holy crap
i'm uh
i'm not clued into the rest of society
even though chad agreed with me for the
most part
um this one i'm like the reactions are
completely correct you'd think if if i
you i guess it just goes to show
everybody's got an opinion that they're
aberrant on i guess
not the [ __ ] clever way
i i definitely when i think about the
way that i interact with my parents i i
really want clevver to be like the first
word that comes to mind not the [ __ ]
clever way to flip the script on them
that way if they can't write a few
paragraphs they have no right to lecture
you af about dropping out of a second
graduate degree do they have three
degrees no tell them to shut it
hey mom
shut it owned owned and then my mom
handed me a crisp one hundred dollar
bill
a master's is nothing to sneeze at well
it's good to see things through if the
end result is desirable so many people
wind up in debt with degrees they never
use simply because that's what's
expected of them the never quit attitude
hurts everyone sure okay
none of that was included in the uh
original post but go off i guess
this is a classic online debate
technique i think which is uh
write something that's unrelated but
true at the bottom of your post to make
the rest of your posts appear that much
more credible
comment deleted by user
worst advice i have ever read
what did they say something to the
effect of sometimes family members say
inappropriate things it's part of being
a family you have to accept it
oh no that's that was my literal point
thanks for telling me and i agree with
you that is utter [ __ ] if anything
family should be held to higher
standards than other people
okay
enjoy uh exclusively uh arguing with
your parents uh for the rest of your
life if they do anything that isn't
exactly what you want them to do
being inconvenienced or irked by other
people is utter [ __ ]
i never do that to other people other
people are always enamored with my inane
conversations about 45 minutes of do you
see that tweet that was like uh
women and this is not my tweet so don't
get mad it it was like i will literally
give my boyfriend a 45 minute preamble
just to talk [ __ ] about somebody for
five seconds
this is
for me the embodiment of that
they think that everyone's so enamored
with their conversations at all times
maybe i'm projecting not the [ __ ] if
they'd apologized at least then might
say yes if they'd done anything to
indicate they get there wrong i might
say yes okay don't leave me hanging
geez could you could we get some updates
so that annual contract 115 can finally
weigh in on this situation
we're all hanging with the thread about
waiting to see where annual contract 115
falls on this issue
not the [ __ ] hard not the [ __ ]
one thing i notice about older people
not the [ __ ] one thing i've noticed
in my
in my anecdotal evidence about old
people is they're convinced they've
already experienced our hardships my
parents come from an era where [ __ ]
costs next to nothing and both have
hired help to do their laundry cook and
whatnot getting a degree is easy as hell
feels nowhere near as advanced
hardest part is getting into university
after that they just go to the discos
every single day when i showed them my
schoolwork they never bugged me about
being dumb or slow ever again
are you okay
do you need the
like look
everybody likes to talk about themselves
three words two of which are duplicates
about the post they're replying to
and then just the
entire paragraph about needing a friend
really
and just being really rude to their
parents which admittedly maybe they
deserve some degree of rudeness but like
i don't even know him man
you're asking me to kind of
meet you there in the middle i don't
they might be they might be nice people
okay
everybody sucks here your family is not
supporting you and that's idiotic okay
that's fair
however assigning them homework with
summaries do what kind of passive
aggressive [ __ ] is that you could
send them the article tell them why it's
important to you and what you took away
from it but making them do a book report
makes you an [ __ ] too yes i could i
couldn't agree more quite frankly
that's there we go we finally grandpa
joe sloth the certified proctologist
there we go
i don't get why everyone thinks you went
too far as signing the essay your family
were trying to make you do years of
study
were they though like based on the post
or were they just like
dropping out as a major decision or
don't even call it dropping out but
you know
abstaining from completing it were they
trying to make you do years of study and
write a whole ass academic thesis or
were they just like are you sure you
want to do that a one-page essay on a
single article about why you're being
unreasonable is hardly anything by
comparison and hilariously apt not the
[ __ ] why are so many posters
uh so into the idea of owning their
parents
that's when i flipped the script on my
father who
you know was a great male role model for
me for the entirety of my high school
career
what's up with people acting like
writing a couple paragraphs is so hard
it's nuts
always forget when you go three posts
down and
anytime you have to click read more
comments you're about to read some of
the most insane [ __ ] that's ever been
written we we gotta not do that ever
again uh okay let's let's throw the
slash marker in here real quick
oh
so many people are so
concerned about you know being the top
dog in their family so



is monday morning
literally barely but literally welcome
to uh reacts court we're gonna be
looking at are am i the [ __ ] filtered
i just realized like the oh and am i the
[ __ ] you can't see the art blessed
uh for you but it's actually meant to be
like a puckered butthole anyway by the
way this episode is sponsored by azure
automate machine learning to increase
developer productivity with azure get
started with 12 months of free services
use code hardcore history
for your free audiobook download am i
the [ __ ] for wanting my girlfriend to
work out more than just legs
apparently they've already spoken for us
here let's see
me and my girlfriend by the way can i
just i like to judge by the headlines to
begin with okay the
are you an [ __ ] for wanting your
girlfriend to work out more than just
legs
not necessarily i mean i feel like you
could have someone's best interest in
mind and want them to work out more than
you know just one muscle group
but
i i have a feeling that there's some
weirdo energy coming off of this let's
see
hey fishy hat
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
it's not gonna buy you influence in
react court but i appreciate it
me and my girlfriend of two years
regularly go to the gym she started
recently and she seems to only do leg
workouts and we barely interact with
each other at the gym because i like to
work on my whole body
who cares so the other day i asked if
she wanted to work out with me so we can
have the same workout routine that's
when she replied with i don't want to as
she continues her only legs workout
program
i'm already interrupting myself i
apologize you're at the gym
who cares
wait we don't you don't work out
together you go to the gym together
you're not you know joined at the hip
you can spend time apart for like an
hour or 90 minutes or whatever and then
just meet and you know get a smoothie
and go home or something like i don't
understand why you got to be in the
exact
exact same area the gym non-stop but
anyway
i tried to name some benefits of working
the entire body by saying you'll see
progress on your legs way faster if you
include your upper body so your legs
have time to recover and rest i know she
wants to be in her peak physique but she
thinks peak physique only means having a
big butt i personally care more about
her other muscles improving such as her
chest and back now i don't mind her body
right now as that's the body i fell in
love with but i just wish she didn't
take the advice the wrong way is this
guy stupid
[Laughter]
i just don't understand
look i
this is what happens and and i've kind
of been there i haven't been there for a
while but uh
you know when you when you get into
lifting if you get semi-serious into it
you stop uh using your normal brain and
instead the first thing you think of
when you see people is like oh man look
at like the striations on their deltoids
that's crazy
oh my god look at like you can actually
see like the separation between the
different muscles on their on their
shoulder blades like that's insane so
like instead of just letting your
girlfriend you know
build up a
a legendary dumpy what are you what are
you talking about when you say i'm more
concerned with like the muscles in her
chest and her back
i don't mean to be rude like it's it's i
actually agree philosophically
it it makes sense to work out your whole
body but to to get so
anal about it if you'll forgive the word
play just seems a little bit
seems a little bit silly and instead you
you're like dude
i know you're probably going to other
forums and you're like dude chicks are
so stupid they don't even care about
their lat spread but like in the real
world you you messed up you messed up in
a big way
i feel like there's no convincing her
without putting it in her head that
she's not good enough which she 100 is
in my eyes are you you're so you're like
a psychopath
there's no way am i the [ __ ] for uh
coming up with the idea to psychically
manipulate my girlfriend to get her to
work out her chest
i haven't spoken about it since that day
because she seemed super irritated when
i gave her reasons to work out with me
a broken watch is right twice a day
am i the [ __ ] for giving her advice
and wanting her to work her full body
this is something that comes up in
almost every am i the [ __ ] post where
op is an [ __ ]
is
the story here
does not lead to the conclusion
logically speaking
there's so many details here
that like if you just had the sentence
oh i guess i'm a [ __ ] because i want
you to have healthy muscles all over
your body no you're maybe
i mean i don't even know if you're a
[ __ ] here so far i just think you
got a little bit of a weirdo energy
um and maybe you've taken the gym pill a
little bit too much rather than caring
about your relationship but this is also
the [ __ ] classic which is uh
you know you're the [ __ ] if you've
made five edits to try to clarify or
fight back
edit i think some of you
are misinterpreting what i meant which
is your fault i didn't constantly tell
her to work out her full body i only
gave her simple advice that i would take
from somebody else because i was afraid
of being by myself in the gym we only
had one conversation about it and i left
it at that ever since also when i say
she started recently i mean she started
at the beginning of the year hey that's
the eight months ago
that's not like
i thought it was like a month ago she's
been doing this for eight months no
wonder she's taken uh a little bit more
offense because on top of being
you know maybe advice she didn't want to
hear in the first place she's also got
her own expertise to some extent i'm
nothing but proud of her and her
accomplishments except for this one
thing that led me to make this post this
conversation only happened once
you've mentioned that for those who keep
using the words keep on also does it
help that i was having this convo with a
smile on my face
low
final edit thanks for the feedback i
didn't expect so many comments just a
heads up me and my girlfriend are
extremely
loud and incredibly close and the topic
wasn't as harsh as you guys think it was
a one-and-done convo she was irritated
at the moment but brush it off legs for
days exclamation mark exclamation mark
exclamation mark so the moral of you
guys's feedback is don't give
unsolicited advice i'll keep that duly
noted
girlfriend only works out legs and oh
this is the tldr
this is i mean
look i the energy radiating off of the
post i'm not a huge fan of i'm realizing
now though this is pretty low-key like
this is i'm i you know what the problem
was i wasn't on top post of the week
this is top posts of the day
so we're actually you know this is like
a this is like a a spark and we're
looking for a raging inferno so let me
go top posts of of this week
wow loki
and you know as soon as we got our warm
up out of the way here's the inferno
okay
am i the [ __ ] for not allowing my
employees to keep tampons or pads in our
bathroom at work
i'm just eager to see what the result
could possibly be or like what the
reason could possibly be
i've gotta know
why you would say no
please tell me
it's not
period gross
little background
i manage it oh okay so you're not even
the owner but like let's not go there
yet oh my god there's so many edits holy
crap okay
little background i manage a retail
store for a relatively smallish company
it's only got 70 or so locations i
currently have two female employees on
my staff in their earlier mid-20s i am a
male in my early 30s yesterday i found a
box of tampons
in the bathroom at our store our store
only has one bathroom so by default it
is also our customer accessible bathroom
some of our stores just by nature of
whatever the building was used for
before we bought them also have employee
bathrooms but ours only has one single
person bathroom that is on the sales
floor one of my female employees had
left them in the bathroom
i informed her that while there's
nothing wrong with keeping feminine
hygiene products at the i've got no
problem
in principle
with feminine hygiene products being
left in the bathroom but i'm just not
sure it's a great fit for our bathroom
personally
she said uh wait they would need to be
kept in the office and could not be kept
in the bathroom
she said that she thought that was
sexist
i told her that it has nothing to do
with the fact that it's a feminine
hygiene product but because it's a
personal use product we don't want to
have kept in the bathroom available to
our customers and that if a male or
female employee wanted to keep a razor
toothbrush deodorant in the bathroom
that would be prohibited as well she
said that's not the same thing as those
are all personal use products everyone
uses not just women okay here's where i
get myself into trouble okay
i
you know how i came across at the start
of this okay
[Laughter]
i thought it was an employee's only
bathroom
especially i thought you know
that it was a women's bathroom and as a
result having that stuff in there makes
perfect sense
if it's
a bathroom that's also used by customers
i don't care sincerely if i walk into a
bathroom and it's just covered in
anything
if i gotta go i gotta go i don't mind um
i i think the argument to analogy about
it being the same as like a toothbrush
or deodorant is a little bit different
like you know it's not like your armpits
start leaking
blood uh if you don't have the tools
necessary to to handle them in the
moment uh
but i can at least it's not as bad
as i originally thought which was that
this manager was like please don't
change
you know your your feminine hygiene
products inside of the women's bathroom
tweet from nl i would like to apologize
for my words twit longer link
anyway i'm just saying it's not as
much
of as holy as he's not
overstepping his bounds to the same
extent i would think that i originally
thought it would be
my other female employee understands
this policy doesn't see anything wrong
with it the male employees aren't really
relevant to the situation but i would
wager that they agree that's not really
um
a data point that you can
use i think
[Laughter]
can you can you do that i haven't asked
them their opinion but i would wager
that they probably agree also like who
cares
um and i yeah putting myself in the
shoes of uh of a male employee i think i
absolutely would not care at all i would
be i just put it in there man
doesn't bother me
i haven't discussed them with it because
it doesn't seem relevant the upset
female employee however finds it to be
sexist and wants to discuss it with hr
which i told her i would be more than
happy to facilitate a conversation with
concerning this
while this is not a documented company
policy i feel as though it's common
sense to not keep personal hygiene
products in a place customers will be
and that hr will agree i don't think so
i
i mean
i think it's possible that hr might
agree but i don't think that means that
hr is right i mean i think that just
means that
hr is is trying to do absolutely
anything that
could minimize the odds of like a
batshit insane liability or like some
kind of
uh psycho going into the bathroom and
being like blue tampons
i'll never shop at fry's electronics
again
um
i've always had a reputation as being
one of the better general managers in
our company i haven't asked anybody
about it but i think they would agree
especially in terms of low turnover and
high employee morale i don't want my
employee to feel as though she's being
discriminated against because she's a
wonderful person and a great employee
but i just don't see how this is sexist
well
who's using the tampons and who's not i
guess would be my question on that one i
can see your point that men don't really
have an equivalent male exclusive item
but i don't see how that changes
anything in this specific instance
uh am i missing something okay here's
the edits
here we go
you know you know
and i i hate to do the king solomon i
always do the king solomon on this stuff
right
would it be possible to maybe like what
what if you install like a little
cabinet below the sink or something like
that
uh
and then you could have an area that
maybe the employees could put
stuff in
and then the customers don't have to see
it and if they start like opening up the
cabinet that's their own problem
like that seems totally fine
i mean how do how much does it take to
install a cabinet what like 25 000. i'm
joking i'm joking
okay sorry
this isn't okay
i i you know what annoys me about people
don't know how to argue okay
and it pisses me off i i apologize for
the rudeness but
they don't in order to get their point
made instead of strengthening their
argument by making another point they
just repeat
something that they got across earlier
and try to get a second bit of argument
strength for it
number one this is not a female bathroom
it's a single toilet unisex bathroom
it's the size of a closet and has a
toilet and a sink yes you've mentioned
that this strike it out it doesn't
matter
this is like when you're watching
impractical jokers and they're giving a
presentation and they click the slide
and there's like
one of them's naked lying in a bed
they're like that sounds bad you're like
i gleaned that
click that sounds i'm walking on sal's
carpet with muddy shoes i that sells
carpet i know it sounds carpet it's it's
implied
in the way that's his dog i know okay
you already said this stuff
you don't need to restate it
this is not my business so installing a
tampon or pad dispenser which i had a
thousand percent support is not remotely
my decision look okay
it's not that there's tampons
in the bathroom it's that they're not
locked in a vending machine that's the
problem
they're just there anybody could grab
him a kid could take him shove him up
his nose
you know pretend he's larry david from
season seven kirby or enthusiasm if you
just put it in like a little dispenser
and you could turn a crank and then they
could come out then it's fine
my employee
did not intend the tampons for use by
customers or other employees i asked
again i i don't see how it's relevant
this is this seems a bit like a straw
man to me
i'm not objecting to the tampons because
i don't understand how periods work on
gross stout but because it could really
cause problems if an auditor comes in
and sees what they will see as a
personal use product left in a public
area
i can't
verify that this would actually happen
but it seems insane to me
i i and again i don't work in business
inspection
[Laughter]
but i do look at like the vancouver
restaurant shutdown list
i've never seen one that said
uh because they they transparently
released the information they've never
in my entire life reading them i've
never seen one that was like there was
wrapped tampons in the bathroom
usually it's no hot water no hot water
rat infestation
no hot water is a lot of no hot water
i'm not again i don't work in this i'm
just saying
can they no no hot rats yeah exactly
but like how i just don't understand the
argument that you could
like have like toilet paper is fine and
like a garbage can that's full of
people's snot or whatever is totally
fine but like a rap tampax is like
that's across the line i know people are
going to be like auditors are crazy and
but i need like i would need to see like
a specific example there yeah you're
right it sounds like it's like the
tampon gestapo is coming around
is it
are you are you harboring
any tampax
yeah they're just on the counter they're
just on the sink um okay i'm not
objecting because they think they're
gross or whatever uh eddie just a couple
more clarifying points
this has been a pretty split decision so
far
in
all ways but the literal um it is a very
small store have i mentioned the size of
this place that the the tampons
make up a large amount of the density
of the store we've already established
the bathroom is very small
the tampa is the store is so itty bitty
the tampons are so noticeable like you
gotta you gotta move around them just to
get down the
aisle 10. there's no cabinet under the
sink or space for a cab there's no space
for a cabinet
i refuse to believe this
i don't buy it for a damn what do you
mean there's no space for a cabinet well
you don't have floors
how do you do you just open a mail slot
and stick your you know what in and then
pee in the toilet i don't understand
it's so small
the only places to put anything is
the floor
on the sink itself or on top of the
toilet
that being said a proprietary wall
mounted dispenser could work
it's not possible to mount a cabinet
but a dispenser could theoretically work
something that holds tampons could not
fit
unless it also had a large metal crank
on the front of it and a coin slot that
you could put a quarter into
otherwise it's not possible to put any
kind of mechanism that could hold these
things
i'm not permitted to make changes like
that to the facilities i will bring up
the option with hr
the office is roughly 10 steps from the
bathroom at most they are right next to
each other
objection your honor relevance we have
one or two employees on shift at a time
if there's one employee they're
encouraged to place a pre-made
bathroom sign on the store's door and
lock the door no question asked
i will readily admit my examples were
not a good comparison and not well
thought out in my fourth edit on my
second edit
okay now this is
the this is an appeal to uh
to his hurt feelings
to the people saying i'm an immature
misogynist insecure in my own
masculinity who's grossed out by
menstruation and tampons you're entitled
to your opinion but i'm just not i've
always been perfectly comfortable with
my sos and female roommates keeping
whatever they need wherever they need it
it's just the sanctity of of a fry's
electronics
it's just different okay in your house
if you want to keep that riff raff
around go by all means tampons open
drugs whatever pretty much on the same
level in my eyes
the sanctity of the corporate
environment
is it
is it too much to ask that we just treat
it with the respect and decorum that it
deserves
i will update this post after our
conversation with hr which has already
been scheduled for tomorrow
posted six days ago
um
okay
i mean look i we we have fun here
i don't think based on this post and you
know you're only getting a thin slice of
a person's life i don't think that he's
an immature misogynist insecure in his
own masculinity
i do feel
like maybe he's putting
i mean let me put it this way he's he's
got a little bit of a dwight uh schrute
energy to him like he clearly
takes the the station of his office as
one of the general managers at this
relatively smallish company very
seriously and is is upset about anything
that could possibly move up the chain
and reflect badly on him
uh
that being said
i really don't
i mean maybe
i was gonna say maybe i'm the [ __ ]
but i don't think that's true i just
don't see the problem
it's one of those things where i'm like
when something's this minor and people
are like well people might complain if
we do it i'm like well just why don't
you do it and then if people complain
we'll talk about it and if people don't
complain then you got nothing to worry
about just chill out poindexter like
there's nothing to
nothing to worry about
i i just i i agree i think it's kind of
making a mountain out of a mole hill
this is north america so like i'm not
saying this is just an american thing
but it's so [ __ ] up like how scared
companies are of their customers
i mean i guess in a way it's a good
thing but like
you know i think within reason like you
shouldn't be
in an environment where like the company
is just bending you over but instead
it's like you you know the the manager
is worried like the most insane person
on earth will walk into the bathroom and
be like you reminded me of my menstrual
cycle
i
spend fifteen thousand dollars a month
at this applebee's and i'm never coming
back now like it's just disgust there's
children here that could see the the the
pad with the wings on it and then how
are they supposed to eat their infinite
jalapeno poppers with that information
like it's just uh
i mean i i guess i kind of feel for like
the
i feel for the manager to the extent
that he feels so scared of
both the tampon auditor and like his own
customers
like that sucks but at the same i think
you got to kind of
i don't i'm i'm torn on this one because
i am also like
i don't know i don't know where i'm at
on this one i think he's more in the
wrong and i think quite frankly
his uh fixation on a dispenser being
okay but a a cabinet not being possible
like you know you could just make the
i mean i'm not saying he should do it
but you can get like a custom-made
cabinet this only like you know is is to
the size that you want it to be made
they make itty bitty ones much like your
bathroom they make enormous ones much
like some of the other stores but not
yours as you've made very clear um
i think i think if you just do that
you're you're fine but
i think you're
i think you got to be careful because if
you're like it doesn't bother me
but
it could bother other people
you got to figure out like where you
stand on that if it's like you know
having like your butthole out when
you're at work i can see his point that
some people might take offense to that
even if it wouldn't bother me but in
this situation i think that it strikes
me more as something that he's like i
don't like it and i'm gonna like
gaslight you into thinking that the
average person on planet earth out here
is like gonna be super offended by
seeing this stuff
i think he's he's my hunch and i'm just
one person
is that he's so he's using
a fictional
average person as a substitution for his
own aversion to this for whatever reason
that's my two cents
but i do also feel yeah it sounds like
corpus is kind of stinky so i feel i
don't think he's a huge [ __ ] i feel
like he's a bit of a
i don't know i mean in for a situation
that's so minor i feel like if you're a
good manager you got to stick out your
neck for
your employees instead of sticking out
your neck for a customer you haven't
even met
that may or may not even exist
am i the by the way build on your terms
from anywhere microsoft azure
sponsoring this episode uh
am i the [ __ ] for
blasting copyrighted music anybody some
anytime somebody tries to tick-tock
video on the bus or train
and i am on to get them strikes
as somebody who is a social media uh
content creator uh no
just based on this not the [ __ ]
i
despite being a content creator i get
well i guess it's literally an [ __ ]
move don't get me wrong but i also
i mean if it doesn't concern you i guess
yeah wait i'm coming back on this that
being said i you know what i made the
classic
am i the [ __ ] redditer mistake
i agreed with them
that the people he's being an [ __ ] to
are annoying and assumed you can't be an
[ __ ] to annoying people i i
appreciate that i was called out by chat
there that being said i
i get annoyed you know when people are
filming social media stuff in public
even as hypocritical as it is but let's
let's see
i've done this at least six or seven
times but the most recent time made me
curious so some girl a few days ago on
the bus i ride regularly had her friend
take her phone out and start recording
for tick tock and i quickly started
playing disney music then asked them to
stop because i don't care for being
recorded
she lost her [ __ ] yelled at me called me
an [ __ ] told me to turn the music off
and even tried to get me kicked off the
bus when i refused i turned it back on
every time they tried to record purely
to make sure they could get copyright
strikes if they tried to upload so
here's the question am i the [ __ ] yes
i was in shot they were filming from the
front of the bus and i usually sit at
the back you didn't have to tell me that
i knew you were a cool guy cool guys
always sit at the back
i should have noted this several other
people on the bus were annoyed with the
two girls running up and down the aisles
with their filming i wasn't the only one
i don't have this music on my phone i
jumped to youtube and played a video not
sure why i need to clarify this though
that's fine you don't um i did ask them
nicely a single time to stop her at the
very least record with me behind the
girl with the camera i was ignored hmm
um
i'm kind of with chat where i'm like i'm
not i don't totally believe that this
story happened
but i will also say i've ridden the bus
you know for several years in vancouver
some
[ __ ] that you would think is fake goes
down all the time
people just ripping open bags or like
spring mix and and digging in with their
hands and stuff like that
i got i got cyber bullied irl because i
was
the the bus got this i'll give you the
cliff notes our bus got clipped by a
drunk driver we all had to get off the
bus
in order to make sure there was no
damage we all got back on the bus
i was the last person on the bus and i
sat in one of the seats of the front
that is prioritized for the elderly and
people with mobility issues and then
somebody at the back of the bus just
started yelling at me and just went off
for like 20 minutes
and was saying some stuff that i will
not repeat
to begin with but i was my look is this
if we're going into the
am i the [ __ ] i still maintain i'm
not the [ __ ]
you don't have to give up you don't have
to abstain from the seats
until
somebody comes on
like if there's
you know
12 seats like that
you wait
if you can at least you wait until
somebody comes on and then you go i i'm
the first person to stand up
even when
like
just when a lot of people come on the
bus i'm like all stand up
because i just like standing man i sit
down all day but anyway they're not for
those passengers only it's for those
passengers
when
they're on the bus anyway
yeah people they want to make problems
for no reason anyway long story short um
that it's long story done i guess
but either way edit seven the seats on
the bus were blue i'm not sure why this
matters i'm not sure why i was forced to
make this edit uh
i mean
i don't know what to say man i don't i
don't know what to say okay
i i really thought this said yes i was
shot
i mean if they're being
kind of belligerent
you know if if they if if let's take
let's assume this happened to face value
rather than selectively discounting
stuff
uh
that feels like it's fake
if we take him in his word and he asked
them politely to stop or at least allow
him to get out of frame
and they ignored it then i don't feel
like he's an [ __ ]
if he said that he did that because it
makes him less of the [ __ ]
then
he's kind of an [ __ ]
it does say he's done it seven times
which is genuinely hilarious
i just scanned him it's like tick tock's
only really been around for like two
years so you're telling me that he's
he's doing this like you know once every
four months or something like that um
but it is also ignorant to uh
to film in public especially like it's
not like they were filming like a vlog
or something which can still be annoying
but it sounds like they were like
running up and down the aisles it's
annoying um
i don't know this i i'm i'm kind of of
like the
i'm kind of in the everybody sucks here
camp i guess
i kind of want to see some more comments
let's see
it's got seven teardrops tattooed
under his eyelid well not under his
eyelid i hope
okay so here's the classic okay
your bus your rules
um
maybe you're an [ __ ] but the people
who start recording on public
transportation deserve what they get is
this is exactly where i started
i think we can move from there um
they deserve what they i don't know if
you could ever say you deserve what you
get what what if he like you know
smash him in the kneecap with a tire
iron give him the tanya harding not the
[ __ ] people can tick-tock all the
live long day but they need to be
mindful of other people's right to not
be involved i i agree okay lol as if
they cared i know them personally this
happened my buddy eric we're all most
likely in one tick tock per day without
even knowing it
most mostly we're as if they cared
source dude just trust me we're all most
likely in one tick tock per day without
even knowing it source dude just trust
me 146 upvotes by the way
not the [ __ ] people need to be more
respectful of people around them so much
this you're genius
definitely not the [ __ ] tick tock is
the [ __ ] up dudes really wow up dudes
thank you so much for the gold kind
stranger
info were you actually in shot or was it
an option to move seats to be out of
shot rather than blasting music to annoy
the whole bus not just those filming
why should he have to get up and move
seats why should they inconvenience
everybody else well
look you're not gonna love this okay
because it's the [ __ ] bus
it sucks
like it's great
it's cheap it goes to most of the places
you want to go but you got to be around
other people that's
you know this is a public space
that's this kind of the deal
why should i ever have to change my life
for anybody else not the [ __ ]
sure you know i look
maybe the comments are not that good
here
[Laughter]
good for you i'm sick of this crap in
public places i haven't left my house in
six months but in my head it's just
constant you can't even walk to the
grocery store anymore without
tons of these freaking zoomers with
their tick tocks out
probably leaving their tampons
everywhere in public places wrapped up
in sanitary paper haven't even been open
yet it's crazy
okay i had to scroll for a bit
i'm gonna go and this is finally one
that agrees with me i'm gonna go and say
everybody sucks here filming tick tock
in public areas is annoying but they
also have to understand people around
them won't want to be filmed or that
they're a copyrighted materials all over
they suck for that but at the same time
blasting music in public transportation
is really annoying and obnoxious i would
have been annoyed with the both of you
that's i think if you if you put
yourself in the mindset of just the
other people on the train
instead of just having to um
you know deal with some
annoying teenagers
now you've got uh
two annoying teenagers and then also a
reddit cairo sedgero who is like i'm
gonna be the the trained defender
by playing a whole new world by disney
and and starting a fight on the bus like
you know
it it happens now and then on the bus or
the train people will do like [ __ ]
stuff
i am so thankful that whenever like i'm
on the skytrain and somebody says like
you know i remember one time i was on a
skytrain and this dude just kept going
like people getting on the skytrain with
their
[ __ ] backpacks you gotta take your
[ __ ] backpack off and put it on the
ground so there's room for and he was
getting like
and i just kind of like looked to my
left and looked to my right and i was
surrounded by normies who were just
going we know how you deal with this
situation you don't go excuse me sir
can you not use so many cuss words on
the train you just you know
wait till there you wait till your
stopper there stop this is a run out the
clock situation where we just you get
annoyed and then you talk about it over
cocktails later
anyway
this uh also like i don't feel bad cause
i don't think this story uh happened
that's that's my two cents is that i'm
not totally sure that this story uh took
place in the real world but um
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to go to a
concert
with my wife after she called the lead
singer her dream man
that this all depends on the band
as far as i'm concerned
if it's like
30 seconds to mars
then we gotta have a conversation
it's bono oh no
it's sugar ray that's even worse man
okay please tell me the band i gotta
know my wife is a big fan of rock music
crazy about a month ago she started
going on about one of her favorite bands
and how cute and talented the lead
singer is
of course that's no problem i'm not
jealous of a random celebrity however
she then proceeded to tell me this lead
singer is her exact type and her dream
man she even said at one point if only
he wasn't married but tried to make it
sound like a joke okay look this that's
pretty bad
like
i you you can say
like oh they're cute they're attractive
like etcetera etcetera um
but when you when you take it a step
further than that
if it it depends on how it came across
okay it depends on how the joke came
across you don't have to be insecure
like
if somebody was like oh if only he
wasn't married i'd totally be in it or
if only i wasn't married i'd totally be
into that
i don't think that in every situation
you could just be like oh flip the
script like what if the husband said
that about like paramore or something
like that
you know i but in this situation because
it strengthens my point i'm like
what if you flip the script on this one
for context this man literally could not
be more different from me i'm on the
bigger side mixed race short hair and
the musician is a skinny white dude with
long hair
i'm just laughing i didn't expect that
there would be a
race component here but okay um i know
she didn't mean it to be hurtful towards
me but it kind of stung to hear straight
up how different i am from her dream
type appearance wise and her comments
brought us some insecurities i thought
i'd gotten over it wasn't a big deal so
i didn't let her know this upset me at
the time and moved on from it turns out
the band is coming to our city in a few
weeks my wife originally wasn't able to
get tickets since they're so expensive
but this morning she texted me her
co-worker bought tickets but can't make
it and is willing to resell the two
tickets at a much lower price she called
me to confirm that i would go with her
and she should go ahead and get the
tickets i took a minute but i said oh no
honestly i'd rather not accompany you to
a concert where you're just gonna be
fawning over your dream man the whole
time
that's one that
clearly you've been turning over and
over
in your head in the shower for like
three weeks and it just
sometimes
just the most venomous kind of of
of message can come out of your brain
fully formed and it's clear that you've
been thinking about this way longer than
the person who casually asked the
question that's that's cringe i don't i
don't say that word often but that's a
little cringe clearly the wound had been
festering
but by the way also owned great line
like you turned it around on her and you
turned it around on her in a position
where
uh you have leverage because apparently
she needs your permission so you know
clearly someone here has read the art of
the deal
she seemed totally shocked by this and
responded why are you making this about
you we talked it out for a bit but i
didn't back down and told her i'm not
interested in going she can of course
take a friend or someone else but i
simply don't feel like going with her
this upset her a lot more than i thought
i would she came home from work nearly
in tears asking why i'm being petty and
selfish by not going with her she said
the lead singer is just a dumb celebrity
crush she was rambling about and it
makes no sense for me to be taking it
personally and making this an issue
between us i told her i'm not mad at her
or trying to
honey i'm not trying to start drama with
you you're my wife i don't want to start
drama with you
i just would prefer not to accompany her
to this particular show we haven't
talked since last night and i don't
really feel like apologizing am i the
[ __ ] for not budging on this
uh edit for everybody asking the band is
tame impala
i'm not cool enough i i tame impala was
getting popular
like
right as i
stopped listening to any song that came
out from that point forward so
as as soon as
real estate came out with beachcomber i
was done i was like i'm full
lead singer kind of looks like jesus
okay
does he
talk like an animal that you remember
talks like a gentleman not like an
animal what am i talking about anyway
um
look i don't like the killers either
i'm surprised okay
because i think uh
the judgment is not the [ __ ]
keep in mind how i started with this by
the way was by saying that i think she
went a little bit over the the line um
but i think he's definitely the [ __ ]
like he took you know what this is and
you you can really like make am i the
[ __ ] posts as i think you should
leave sketches this is
a guy and his wife go to uh magic show
the magician humiliates the guy
the wife
stokes the guy's insecurities and then
the guy goes back on stage and goes i
make ten times what you make
well you wouldn't know it from that suit
you ruined my life
[Laughter]
it's just uh
i'm just uh i i think his response he
clear his feelings were hurt but your
feelings can be heard and then the
action you take as a result of that can
be not commensurate with the slight that
led to your feelings being heard in the
first place and just because maybe the
first stone was not thrown by you that
doesn't mean that you're not the [ __ ]
for the way that you responded however i
don't even think he's like a huge
[ __ ] for saying
i don't want to go with you to a concert
where you're just going to be finding
over your dream man i think
that's an [ __ ] move but if he at
least with the benefit of hindsight what
appears to be like 18 to 24 hours later
if he had just been like hey i'm sorry
that i
hit you with a nuclear bomb when you
asked me if i wanted to go to the
concert but my feelings were actually
hurt by all the things that you said
about the lead singer in the first place
then it would be cool but then there
also would not be a post because instead
he has gone to reddit and been like am i
the [ __ ] so i think if the longer
this situation goes on for the more that
you're kind of the [ __ ] here for sure
like you the fact that you haven't
i mean like you is i she's not gonna
that leaves you for the lead singer of
tame impala okay
and if she does you can
get like a lot of play on like the talk
show circuit get interviewed by
pitchfork and stuff like that you you
know like you got an avenue to exploit
there
it's just a concert you're it's good
just take her to the concert and then
like is fine like i don't know it's
who cares
i just don't i i guess i i get that his
feelings were hurt but when you look at
it from a rational standpoint i'm just
like
why don't you just apologize to your
wife go to the concert they're a
well-liked band right
are they good if it was imagine dragons
i'd be like
hit the gym but
like get over it man
i guess
and by the way this not to the same
extent but this happens to me now and
then kate will watch like a k-pop video
and be like oh g-dragon's so hot i'm
like the anti-g dragon
i'm just like okay
whatever like what are you
[Laughter]
if big bang came to vancouver and she
was like do you want to come to the
concert i would be like let's go
i know this and they go
[Applause]
they're going to think i worked there
but you know that's fine
what the hell is g-dragon he's a bad boy
he smoked marijuana in a japanese
bathroom
it was a big a big
controversy in 2011
because in in
south korea pop stars don't do bad boy
stuff they're like the
the way that they're bad boys is like by
having an earring whereas in north
america if you're like a bad boy you'd
like you know throw a tv out of your
hotel room window or something like that
in south korea it's like he took a puff
of a joint in a
japanese bathroom stall
anyway
um
yeah okay there was that one guy we
don't even he got a sentence like a
couple years or two a few years in
prison last week right anyway um that
that's not a bad boy that's a bad guy
that's two different things
the bad boy
is like a veneer he's just a bad person
okay this
there's a distinction there
i do i want i want to see the comments
here because it's always more fun to
look at the comments when you disagree
right um let's let's see on this one
i already know and i hate to like hand
wave this away as if it's not like a
real problem by the way
um
42 may be the answer to life the
universe and everything is this dude so
much this
but when it comes to your team's
processes you need a platform that's
customized to your needs on monday.com
you can build the perfect project
management tools for your workflows
um
so much this man i i already know that
my
assumption is that some of the
uh
comments that are up near the top are
going to be things that are like
not the [ __ ] she way across the line
your feelings were hurt etc etc um but
i'm i don't know maybe it's difference
of opinion maybe it's
difference in perspective but i am
also kind of like
if your feelings can get
you if your feelings get hurt and you're
gonna like fester on it you also have to
take some responsibility for not telling
her that at the time
you know if if if you really were
bothered by something and you're gonna
let it simmer and build resentment and
then come back with like uh you know an
uppercut later when you get jabbed
slightly then you had a responsibility
that you messed up a little earlier to
be like hey that's over the line at
which point you wouldn't have had to
worry about it at all
you know because you she would have been
like oh i apologize and then you know
what i mean it's always easier in
hindsight but
i'm actually super surprised with all
the you're the [ __ ] here it's not
like you're preventing her from going to
the concert i too think of every dispute
that happens in a marriage as uh you
know being a set of pros and cons and
it's more of like a a tort law dispute
as opposed to you know two individuals
with responsibilities and commitment and
feelings it's not like you're she can
still go to the concert she'll just not
be able to enjoy it at all because
she'll be thinking about the fact that
you know her husband is mad at her for
being at the concert
you just don't want to go with her i can
understand how it may be a bit hurtful
to hear your wife constantly go on about
wishing she was with someone else
it doesn't matter if it's a complete
fantasy that would never happen saying
someone the exact opposite of you is her
exact type sounds harsh maybe she didn't
mean it that way maybe you wrote it in a
way that reflects as poorly on her as
possible or or maybe not um but i don't
think it's unreasonable for you to be
heard let her find a friend to go to
with her
agreed but often the replies are from
children who shouldn't even be allowed
on the internet i feel bad they're even
allowed to be giving ratings in this sub
or the replies
are from relationships where they shared
celebrity crushes without the esso
getting jealous
oh man
i'm 18 and this is what the real world
is like
so many kids so many eight-year-olds
logging on to am i the [ __ ]
writing essays about uh
how they should solve their relationship
problems
not the [ __ ] your feelings are valid
you're not being malicious
can i and again i could
i could be wrong this is i where where i
consider myself superior to most of the
comments
to be honest is that i always like this
this is not me coming from on high
giving my objective
viewpoint of how things go
is just my giving my opinion in two
cents okay i'm not saying this is
definitively the right way i think if
your wife says
can we go to this concert for my
favorite band and then you reply
honestly i'd rather not accompany you to
a concert where you're just going to be
fawning over your dream man the whole
time that's malicious
because you this is a comment designed
to
get back at someone because they hurt
your feelings
like you're like i'm gonna
this is not like
what you say when you want to come to a
solution this is like
i'm gonna get back at you because you
made me feel bad
so i'm gonna like flip the script on it
that's he should have said yeah after he
said that and she started to cry he's
supposed to go
oh shot that
to try to like defuse the situation a
little bit
you ruined my life
um okay hold on
she blinds she's blindsided and upset
now because your legitimate feelings
appear to come out of nowhere yes
correct
this this i disagree with this part
but
i totally agree with this part if your
feelings were hurt you should have said
something about it then
again perfect world but i'm surprised by
all you're the [ __ ] i'm fairly
certain if it was a man fawning over a
female celebrity and his wife was
uncomfortable no one would call her an
[ __ ] um
you know
let me think about that for a second
because i flipped the script and now
he's flipping the script on me
all right i'm willing to i'm willing to
seed that point
i think if you flip to the exact same
situation
um he would come across like an [ __ ]
but there is also the and again this you
get yourself in trouble with this one
but still um
what what the f
man i'm just saying
the cultural norm
i think again it could be wrong the
cultural norm it's more normal
for a wife to talk about her celebrity
crushes than the husband i don't know
why it is
i didn't create the culture
i'm i'm a participant actively feeding
into it as time goes on but it would be
like a a wife being like oh my celebrity
crush is like antonio banderas that's
like something that doesn't cross the
bounds of normalcy that happens
all the time but if if i was and they
wouldn't make me uncomfortable if i was
like having dinner with uh you know if i
was on a double date or something and
then my friend's wife was like oh you
know like i love joel mchale i would be
like okay that's normal if
if he said
yeah i want to [ __ ] allison brie i would
be like okay maybe we should just calm
down a little bit all this talk about
community has
everybody's getting heated
[Laughter]
so this whoopee cushion is getting
swoopy cushion's gotten everybody too
excited
that being said i'm not saying that
that's uh i'm not saying that that's
right i'm simply saying
that that's
those one of them fits more with the
culture and one of them fits less with
the culture whether or not that's valid
you know is is a different point
altogether so i'm not sure there's a
situation where you can flip this script
but
anyway i'm i am stunned at the number of
people who are like you aren't stopping
her from going to the concert yeah like
you're not restraining her from going to
the concert
but like
you kind of are
you're like in a psychological sense
like you really think that
she's gonna be like okay and then like
hey jenny come to the concert with me
and like she's gonna have a great time
watching her favorite band she's not
gonna enjoy it knowing that this is
something that's driven a wedge between
her and her husband
it's yeah it's an it's an ultimatum
without having the the courage to offer
the ultimatum in the first place
she could still go and just have
terrible memories wrapped up with it
like come on
not the [ __ ] for you to have so many
differences in appearance to the singer
in her outright saying that he is her
exact type would make anyone make the
connection that you are not her type you
have every right to take it personally
agreed and then we're flipping the
script however
i wish that there was just there's like
one
implied sentence here
well actually you're right there's a
couple of things one is she did marry
you
so
like
you're probably like kind of her type or
like one of her types
[Laughter]
for one and then also
i was waiting for the like you have
every right to take it personally
but you should have talked about that in
the moment rather than
spend 20 showers concocting the perfect
comeback if this situation situation
ever came to pass but instead we get the
script flip again but
not the [ __ ] why would she say this
to you
your feelings are valid i wouldn't want
to go to the concert either i'm
surprised at all the yta comments
this is one of those it's easy to judge
when it's not you situations look that
might be true
but look at the subreddit you're on i
mean
that's kind of what it's there for
hey i've been married to my wife for 20
years we had one argument
you know let's distill it down to three
sentences
i if i had the guests remember the post
that was like this is why your kids
don't get along oh actually their father
died in a traumatic accident when they
were young that drove an emotional wedge
between them don't care didn't ask plus
your kids are ugly like this this is
what this subreddit is made for
i'm happy to look comment deleted by
user they probably got cyberbullied user
was cyberbullied for this post i'm happy
to see someone else who thinks everybody
sucks this kind of fantasy fantasy crush
and sharing it with your partner is not
uncommon or unreasonable op's wife
messed up actually heard him
maybe it was unintentional probably okay
i i would hope to agree and then he
messed up by pretending to himself and
to her that it was no big deal when in
fact he was quite hurt by it and it
brought up insecurities for him
good
so far so good
all right so far i agree
so she's in the wrong for going on and
on about her crush to the point where it
hurt opi's feelings but o p's in the
wrong for sweeping those feelings under
the rug instead of talking with her
honestly about them and then blindsiding
her with them when she had the rare
chance to purchase tickets and needed to
act fast
too reasonable for reddit right now
so much this your wife loves you and
doesn't want to hurt you if she didn't
give you a crap about your feelings she
would have just shrugged off your
statement and said whenever and gone
with a friend without batting an eye but
she does care your words are not the
only thing she's listening to when you
say you can go but i won't come just to
watch you fawn over him
what you're communicating is i feel like
you've chosen him over me and i don't
want to be faced with your feelings for
him if you go without me it'll just
solidify for me that you care more about
indulging in this crush than in being
with your partner this person
is better than me
at the
at the react court
they're even more articulate than i am
so yeah you're wanting to assuage your
feelings by setting aside a rare chance
you're wanting her to assuage your
feelings by setting aside a rare chance
to see a band she really loves instead
of just doing a little introspection and
admitting you have feelings
and talking to her honestly about them
even if it's hard to put into words and
you feel stupid o.p please take
ownership of the pieces of the peace you
could have handled better in most
conflicts
there's a little blame to go around for
everyone apologize for the way you
brought this up apologize for not
telling her when she first heard your
feelings but tell her your her words
were hurtful and that you do genuinely
feel she must not find you terribly
attractive if you accept her apology the
two of you can figure it out
how do you give awards on reddit this is
like
i did madmanmax224
i'm not congratulations or i'm sorry
that happened to you i'm not gonna read
all that i'm not sure she actually cares
about his feelings based on her response
like when she came home in tears hours
later like a total [ __ ]
and when she didn't walk through the
door with a six-pack in her hand and be
like babe i'm so sorry you're totally
right i shredded the concert tickets
like
it's clearly she doesn't care about your
feelings
i'm not sure she actually cares about
his feelings based on her response it
was immature and insensitive it's
clearly bigger than some dumb celebrity
crush based it's i wasn't there it was
clearly bigger than the celebrity crush
based on the vocabulary
and honestly it's genuinely hurtful to
see someone you love express their
desire to be with somebody else
yes and no i guess is what i would say
like
[Laughter]
look so you
did
i
i'm getting stun locked by like
anonymous teenagers on reddit but i'm
just like
i just don't understand
that it's like so over the it seems like
she made a joke that just like went too
far
and what
she shouldn't have made it
but he also shouldn't have been like
everything's fine it's not i'm like a
big strong guy nothing hurts me and then
years later well maybe days later be
like you screwed me you've wounded me
and now i finally now that you're
showing me some vulnerability i can get
back at you
the fact that she was surprised due to
his lack of communication aside her
overall response was childish and
incredibly immature reverse the ev every
comment has reversed the situation and i
doubt you would rule the same
man
played the uno reverse card
yep then she had the audacity to accuse
him
of trying to make this about him when
all he's doing is expressing his
feelings he isn't telling her not to go
just that he doesn't want to spend hours
watching her ogle over her obsessive
celebrity crush [ __ ] that manipulative
[ __ ]
[Laughter]
so dramatic man i i'm i'm fine with and
everybody sucks here yeah
i i think that uh
her joke went too far as we said when we
started this but also simultaneously i
think that you know
he he clearly then went too far in the
other direction
everybody sucks here and you're not
based
you're reading it dramatically look at
how it's written
[ __ ] that manipulative [ __ ] that's even
that's the tick tock explainer voice
i can't do it without losing a piece of
my spirit
okay slash marker react court
one



we got a lot more react court left to go
here
i was originally thinking we could hit
up another subreddit but i think i got
stun locked so hard we've only gone
through like two posts
we got some uh we got some more meat to
pull off the off the bone here if i
could figure out how to get back okay oh
no there's there's a not safe for work
one coming up
oh no no no no no no
am i the [ __ ] for disinviting my
younger daughter's girlfriend to our
family dinner because it upsets my older
daughter
there's absolutely no way you can get
out of this one without being the
[ __ ]
originally i read it like am i the
[ __ ] for disinviting my older
daughter's girlfriend to our family
dinner because it upsets my younger
daughter and i was like yeah
but like maybe if your younger daughter
is like
five
i could at least see you having
a thought about it even if it makes no
sense to me and it's kind of like your
job as a parent to to teach this stuff
but seeing that they're 28 and 25 i'm
like
hold on let's see where we're going here
okay
i'm the [ __ ] for disinviting my
younger daughter's girlfriend
to our
you're this is not even let's ignore the
girlfriend part okay
like the the the fact that maybe this is
uh
i i mean i'm a well you know what i this
says something about me because i was
assuming that it was like
based on some degree of homophobia but
maybe not maybe
she just doesn't like her but even still
you know
we can't be uninviting your children's
significant others to a dinner anyway
let's let's actually read it okay
good point good point
i have two daughters
it's a japanese whiskey let's just call
her whiskey
whiskey and ally
who is 28 and 25.
whiskey is currently staying with us so
her dad and i can look after her while
she's being treated for depression after
breaking up with her boyfriend of five
months okay so they have added
a little
it's not just like everybody was fine
and then i introduced the problem okay
uh
let's take it from there
so the older daughter's staying with
them because she has she's recovering
from depression it sounds shallow and i
can hardly believe like oh
no no no no no
because she's
recovering from depression it sounds
kind of shallow and i myself can hardly
believe she crumbled like this over a
guy who she dated for only a relatively
short amount of time but for whatever
reason it hit her hard
the the mental health expert has logged
on
it's been a difficult time for us even
with therapy and medication she's lost a
lot of weight and still cries almost
every day
ally has been with her girlfriend kara
since january we never met kara in
person because they live two states away
we've spoken through video calls cara is
a very sweet person two weeks ago she
sent us a cake as a gift you
you give him a shovel because he's
digging whiskey didn't say anything but
i later saw her crying and when i asked
why she said it reminded her of the time
when her ex-boyfriend was the one giving
us gifts she couldn't eat for three days
after that and we were so worried we
went back to her psychiatrist to
increase the dosage of her medication
look
let's just keep reading okay
next week my husband and i will be
celebrating our 30th wednesday wedding
anniversary this is in that when you go
the whole audience claps
and ally will be flying home so we can
have a family dinner
she asked if she could take cara with
her so we can finally meet her in person
i said yes when i told whiskey about it
she didn't say anything but spent the
most of her following days crying when i
talked to her and asked what's wrong she
said that she felt like dying every time
she remembers that her ex would have
also gone to our anniversary dinner if
they didn't break up she told me how she
felt guilty all over again and how their
breakup was her fault because she raised
issues she was not comfortable with and
that if she just kept quiet that they
would still be together
her psychologist told me this is a
recurring event for people who are
depressed
they can get triggered by the smallest
things they blame themselves okay with
that in mind i decided maybe this isn't
the time to meet cara
since whiskey is emotionally unstable
and we don't don't know what could
trigger her i told ali i'm sorry but i
don't think our anniversary dinner will
be a good time to have cara over
ali got upset and said it's embarrassing
they have to explain this all to kara
and then she feels i'm playing favorites
she said that she and kara shouldn't
have to make adjustments just because
she broke up with her boyfriend did i do
the wrong thing
this is all [ __ ] up this is just not a
good situation
it's
it's definitely this is not like the fun
am i the [ __ ] where i was like you
know i tried to control another adult's
life am i the [ __ ] and people are
like no your house your rules this is
one where
like
i don't necessarily look
i don't i don't and you're not gonna
hear this might be the first time i've
ever said this like i don't i don't feel
uh
comfortable like passing judgment like
on anybody in this situation
it just seems it just seems bad
now do i want to read the comments to
see uh
what kind of code of hammurabi [ __ ]
the top comments have
have come up with to
[Laughter]
i do but i don't want to do it on camera
so i think we'll probably just move on
to the next one but you know what
that's uh i mean that's that's a tough
one
i i don't have any information to to add
on to that one
i almost
is how how not safe for work could a
text post be okay
am i the [ __ ] for exposing my
husband's swinger lifestyle to his
family i'm just just i'm just gonna put
it off camera for a second okay
just to see because if it's just like
he swings whatever if it's like he likes
to put his blah and the blood and then
go
like maybe i'll skip it but
it seems fine
okay
i have been married to my husband for
five years my husband's family are your
typical snotty catholic mega religious
people my husband is not religious but
still remains respectful of their
beliefs and has always lived his second
life in private
you can do that you you can you can be a
swinger and not uh tell your grandma
it's what there's some
haven't you heard the random rules no no
one should have two lives now my middle
names are wrong and right
i joined a dating app with the sole
purpose of finding us another couple or
even a unicorn
chat can i get a little help on this one
a unicorn is
the swinging term for a bisexual
single woman okay thank you
because i
who doesn't want a relationship okay
thank you appreciate it now i feel like
i'm up to speed here um thank you thank
you for the education chat is so hoarse
with the horn on his head
[Laughter]
oh man
well if you can find one of those geez
louise we are living in the future this
was my husband's idea usually we go to
parties where we feel safe and not
judged i'd never use a dating app so i
posted your typical what i do for work
what movies and music i like i identify
as bisexual so myself and my husband
have shared a few women and never had an
issue well on the app i guess some girl
who knows my husband and his family saw
me they confronted me in front of
everyone and accused me of cheating his
aunt said horrible things about me i
tried to tell them he knew but he didn't
back me up or say anything the argument
got even more heated and that's when i
exposed us i told his family everything
how we've shared other women slept with
other couples and even that they've
babysat while we did this i believe that
was the [ __ ] part my husband felt
that i disrespected his family for
saying that even though he didn't stick
up for me while they called me uh i
don't
even want to say it among other things
now his innocent holy reputation is
ruined and he says because of me he
can't show his face to his family am i
the [ __ ] they see this is more fun
i don't i don't think she's the [ __ ]
at all
like what what would what's the
alternative to this situation once she
gets called uh
when she gets called out like this if
he's not stepping in to protect her you
know with the truth
the dude should have stepped the dude
didn't even have to
say like oh word like swinging or
whatever he could have just been like
you know yeah i knew
[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] you know
you just come up with something you
didn't have to like shoot your whole
load pun intended i suppose but like
she she also could have said that i
don't know i would be mad i that i was
being thrown under the bus by like the
only person who who can like get me out
of this jam without me exposing their
secret
he could have just told his parents or
his family to like mind your own
business
he is 27 years old
that's okay
she didn't have to
say all the stuff that she said
but simul or
simultaneously i'm like you know
i think she was kind of getting back at
him for being silent and i gotta say
you go girl
then also you can't be mad about what
people do when you babysit
it's not a you're not a paramedic it's
not like oh you called me for this like
if you were going to see like some
shitty movie you'd be like well that's
one thing but you guys were practicing
an alternative lifestyle i'm not looking
after your kid anymore it's just
if you were going to see shang chi the
legend of the ten rings that would be
one thing but you're going out here to
you're getting involved in all this
dirty stuff
are you defending yourself yeah because
i'm trying to get a babysitter so i can
go see
shanghai in the legend of the ten rings
man
i haven't missed the marvel movie
opening weekend since like i don't even
know i think since doctor strange came
out
it's been a while
ah not not the [ __ ] and you know what
i mean that's a perfect ratio right
there not the [ __ ] 69 percent
also i do kind of feel like um
her and her husband have made made a
mistake here simultaneously as well you
know
like if if you want to keep it
i don't know i have no experience with
this but i'm like if you want to keep it
private then maybe don't make a public
dating profile
but simultaneously
your husband should have backed you up
no no problem there anyway
not everybody sucks though you know is i
i think her husband sucks she's not the
[ __ ] am i the [ __ ] for asking my
boyfriend to cancel dinner with his son
and daughter-in-law because i was
specifically not invited
if these
come up all the time
like it just makes me realize that like
i guess i have good friends and like
nice family members
never in my life have i ever
seen a situation where they were like
please don't invite
you know your significant other
but just everybody is just treated as
like a package deal
you can't invite one without the other
because that's they're like they're a
unit you know
this is crazy anyway boring boring we've
seen it
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting my
boyfriend's kids to come over anymore
oh i l i love a wedding one
am i how could this happen
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to give up
my dream
wedding dress
though it means my fiance's family
will not attend
am i the [ __ ]
for refusing to give up on my dream
wedding dress though it means my
fiancee's family will not attend maybe
it's revealing
let's see
oh
baby there's some edits
[Laughter]
i'm in a lot of turmoil right now and it
feels like everything's falling apart
now you know you've sufficiently made me
feel guilty for trying to mine this for
humor
but moving on i had have never had a
great relationship with my future
mother-in-law it isn't terrible but i
can sense that she doesn't like me my
fiance is very close to his family so
there's been some tension
i didn't invite mother-in-law wedding
dress shopping because our relationship
is awkward
but i thought i'd show her a picture to
make her feel included my dress is a
beautiful flowy beach
beachy dress but not technically a
wedding dress and could be ordered in
color i bought it from a small local
boutique that we both love here
mother-in-law said that i can't wear
that dress because she bought the same
one for her 50th birthday which is two
weeks after my wedding
is this really worth
breaking up the family over
[Laughter]
mother-in-law does have the dress though
in a mint green color there's enough
detailing that it is clearly the same
dress and she has the receipt to prove
she got it first
okay lavish birthday parties are a thing
in our circle so i know she has invested
serious time and money in this party i
said that i'm still gonna wear the dress
despite the fact that i could easily
return it with no loss because i didn't
do this out of malice and i love it
mother-in-law says if she wears it two
weeks after i do everyone is gonna think
she's pathetic and copying her son's
wife i said sorry but peter parker dot
wave i miss the part where that's my
problem
this is so good
everyone has gone crazy since i said
that
his entire side of the family and the
friends mother-in-law invited have all
backed out of the wedding so like 15
people and it will be noticeable his
sisters were supposed to be in the
wedding party on his side but dropped
out and have blocked him on everything
[Laughter]
they blocked him
they blocked their own brother on
everything because
he
his
fiancee is going to wear the wedding
dress that his mom's going to wear to
her 50th birthday party
that's crazy man
oh my god i'm i i glanced further his
stepdad won't talk to him and says he
regrets raising him and he isn't a this
can't be real he he isn't a real man
because a real man would stand up for
his mom his bio dad is even on
mother-in-law's side which doesn't
surprise me because they are good
friends but he called us up just to
shame us the other night my fiance is
hurting and found that his family had a
big beach day and invited everyone but
him
he called mother-in-law and they talked
but didn't come to a resolution she said
if i refuse to do the right thing the
only answer is no one going to her party
can go to the wedding he tried calling
sister-in-law and found out she blocked
him he is mad at me now and feels like
she had it first
okay so that's the end before the edits
this is insane
let me just start by saying i am let's
assume it's real because that's we
that's the only way we can ever discuss
these to begin with um the fact that
this is and everyone sucks is
hilarious to me i want to make sure that
that computes this is because i'm okay
so when i scroll down i see not the
[ __ ] eventually won out um
i i couldn't imagine this being like a
plurality of everybody sucks here
cause like
look i hate to say it there's a
hierarchy of events
okay wedding
pretty close to the top of the list
maybe there's some other stuff up there
surgeries
child's birth like you know
admittedly
can i funerals of course yes
but
wedding is close to the shang chi in the
legend of the ten rings um new isaac
expansion
et cetera et cetera
wedding is high it's near the
top when you have it you're like this is
the only one i'm going to have
whether that ends up happening you know
for i mean this lady appears to have
had a couple herself so maybe she
doesn't treat it with the decorum that
it was designed to have but either way
50th birthday i'm going to be honest
like it's probably
in the top half
it's bet it's more important than your
51st is more important than your 47th
birthday
but it's way below wedding like it's
substantially below
uh
you're especially like your first
wedding
but maybe people don't want to hear that
but like you know if a friend of mine
had been divorced five times and he's
like i'm getting married this july i'd
be like we might skip this one
i'll catch the reboot
so like just getting that the the
foundation of it out of the way
who
cares
like
isn't it like you're already rich
clearly
can you just like shut the [ __ ] up
who cares
you're gonna she's gonna she gets to
choose whatever dress she wants to wear
it's her wedding everyone would agree on
that
oh sorry you can't wear this dress to
your wedding because i'm wearing it to
my 50th birthday beach party that's just
idiotic
you can wear the whatever you want to
your wedding you can wear whatever you
want to your beach party if you get
annoyed
that other people are going to be like
oh you're copying
your daughter-in-law then you can buy a
new dress
uh
especially because you still got the
receipt this is not like a first-come
first-served situation like i got dibs i
bought it first you know the wedding
trumps a birthday party it's the rules
man
um
also your family or your husband's
family is insane
this is
idiotic
normally when i read these i'm like
people need to talk more this is one
where i'm like
you are actually you've been done like
an incredible service by the fact that
these people want to remove themselves
from your life
they did it without you having to do it
you get to maintain like the moral high
ground
and you know how many times you could
you could talk to like 98
of the
earth's population and if you if you
were like yeah they uh blocked their son
and brother on everything because i was
gonna wear the same dress to my wedding
that they were gonna wear to their mom's
50th birthday party uh people would be
like that's crazy
you could farm that for attention for
the rest of your life
i think you've been given an incredible
a glimpse into the future and an
incredible gift
that's my take on this
see you look at this cute baby
i do need to see
i mean like i'm assuming this is one
where i don't want to click on the
comments because i'm like i think
they're all just going to agree with me
uh
but i would like let's see the first
everybody sucks here
there's gotta be one like i know it's
gonna be you can wear whatever you want
okay they seem to agree
pass everybody sucks here all of you
sound difficult except possibly your
esso who's caught between a bunch of
self-righteous and title people who
don't care about the damage they do
i i can't believe it's the second
comment down
this the mother-in-law is difficult but
so is op you could have been the bigger
person and got in another dress
seems like o.p chose it to make it more
difficult and is a bit of a b tied zilla
1.2 000 upvotes
you should help your fiance out and not
wear the dress get a different one
because you're ruining his relationship
with his family and yeah they're being
[ __ ] but he loves them and you're
driving the wedge
this is what she did was
she's being a so b titan zilla is a
bridezilla
it really doesn't sound like she's uh
being a bridezilla for
wanting to wear the dress that she
picked out
and uh
her whole family
blocking their own son and brother
because of the fact that the woman that
he's gonna marry
is gonna wear the dress that they're
gonna
then wear to a birthday party later
is a substantial degree of magnitude
above
just wanting to wear whatever dress you
actually chose for your own wedding
okay she did say that's your problem
which is very funny
but maybe she could have said it in a
nicer way
it is their problem but still
it would have been better if she sent
the picture of tobey maguire though um
everybody sucks here to be honest you
kind of walked into this one by
purchasing a non-wedding dress from a
local boutique that the two of you both
like you should have just gone to like
some kind of industrial wedding store
you could have taken a flight to spain
and bought a wedding dress there or
something like that happens all the time
this is what you get for shopping at the
same store you get you have honey you
reap what you sow there was always going
to be a distinct possibility of
something like this happening maybe you
can suggest going dress shopping with
your future mother-in-law to find her a
new dress for her birthday that sounds
like that's going to be a fun time
i'd love to be a fly on the wall for
that brunch
it seems like this
oh 50th birthdays are kind of a big deal
not like a wedding but a significant
milestone so i understand she wants to
look nice for it and there's probably
still a good chance a large number of
the guests of the birthday will have
also attended the wedding and she's not
totally out of line for thinking people
might say she copied you and this is
where you say but who gives a [ __ ]
at
all clothes are meant to be worn
you could i mean why don't you just tell
them the truth i bought it first
actually did you know i actually bought
it first
or
what have you just said you know she
looks so good in it i thought maybe i
would pick up one for myself or just go
haha yeah anyway moving on
we closed the merger last week and now
our bank account's grown by like another
eight figures like i just don't
understand why this has to be such a big
deal
but again you're the one buying your
wedding dress from a non-local bridal
boutique so you were running the risk of
buying something that other people would
want to wear to non-wedding events and
as you know
clothes
as soon as you take them off they
explode
the concept of wanting to wear this
every whenever i go to h m
which is where i buy many of my finest
outfits
i buy an eight dollar t-shirt off a rack
where there's 15 of them
put it on
pay for it
two weeks later i'm wearing it if i see
somebody else wearing it i say listen
buddy what the [ __ ] do you think is that
is that basic basic m from h m burgundy
basic amp
i'll have you know today's the day i'm
okay there's 35 000 of them uh being
worn in vancouver right now it's on site
buddy
don't you know i'm wearing this and it's
uh i'm only three months away from uh my
33rd birthday
oh it's the 10th anniversary of your bar
mitzvah yeah well uh my mom
uh
is celebrating
uh her uncle's birthday next friday
let's it's just crazy man who who cares
you're wearing the same
just
they're meant to be worn i guess is what
it's just
i mean if you are like this if you get
wealthy and you act like this you're
actually just
stupid and i
don't apologize for saying it
like you're it seems like they got it
all together like from a financial
standpoint just [ __ ] off and enjoy being
rich
canapes in the garden
you know people bringing around
cocktails to you while you you talk
about dumb [ __ ] nobody cares about just
enjoy your life why why add this
needless drama and be miserable
like people who have real struggles it
just seems like you you you royally
screwed up if you can be
wealthy enough to care about this and
then you also care about it
it's like a simulatory problem it's not
it's not a real stress
which i know is rich coming from a
twitch streamer but i'll be the first
person to tell you i'm a bit of a
hypocrite myself
i'm something of a hypocrite myself i
wish i missed the part where that's my
problem not the [ __ ] i'm fighting i'm
finding this hard to believe
absolutely
i do agree with that
everybody sucks here you're all
sacrificing relationships over a dress
no one here is in the right
i love i love the idea that you could
just fix this by seeding to an unreal
unreasonable demand
it no matter how thin the paper is it's
still got two sides
can't you see you're in love
and then i feel so bad for for your
husband
he's torn
between the worst human beings of all
time and the person he chose to spend
the rest of his life with how can i
choose
it's not possible
ah all i know
is that i'm completely innocent in this
situation and had absolutely no role in
how it played out
oh my god
it's going to give me like an aneurysm
man
i'm just i'm scrolling
oh man yeah we got like we got like 18
minutes here it's so good
we can we can finish off with like top
of the week we want plates but i think
we got a couple more here
am i the [ __ ] for wanting my
boyfriend to get a better job
this is a weird one because usually
the headline makes them seem like
there's no way they couldn't be an
[ __ ] but i'm like hey
wanting someone to get a better job not
[ __ ]
the way that you say it
or the reason that you say it might
matter
my boyfriend and i have been dating for
a year and it's been going mostly good
except he doesn't make much and i have
to pay for everything not related to
basic necessities we don't leave
together at the more at the moment so he
pays for his rent car food
and that's about all he can afford
so
he does pay for
things
like i mean i get that you're saying
he only pays for like the basic
necessities but it's
i mean you're knocking out your rent
your car and your groceries like that's
you're doing okay
whenever we go out i have to pay for all
the date nights trips and even gas for
road trips since he can't afford
anything but the basics he makes 28k as
a meatpacker i make 94k as a data
engineer okay i mean there's a there's a
disparity
i don't care that he makes less but he
makes so little that in our area he
can't afford much besides to go to work
and go to sleep if we want to go camping
i have to buy or rent all the equipment
pay for gas pay for the park fees and
camping
you can tell that they're in love
otherwise we can only sit at home and
play video games or cook something
together which we do but i don't want to
do that every weekend here's what i'm
going to say okay
this sh what she's writing is not nice
that's
obvious
like it's not a
kind thing to write
that being said
if
they are in love
and
she wants him to have some extra
ambition i could understand it creating
the conflict but i'm just that's one
paragraph okay i know it's not so easy
you don't strap on your job helmet go
into job land let's this is just the
preamble we don't pass judgment yet in
every situation let's see what happens
from this point onwards
the other problem is he doesn't have
much motivation to get skills or get a
better job he worked for the meatpackers
after finishing a semester at culinary
school but he only did that because his
dad is a chef i don't think he's
depressed or anything like that i've
known him since high school and he's
always kind of been this way after high
school i went to college and dated guys
also when working they made more and had
more motivation but they were flaky and
i wanted someone and just wanted someone
they can sleep with he is actually
someone who wants a family but now i'm
worried about how we can be compatible
in marriage when he isn't motivated to
better himself also i don't want to
carry him financially through the
marriage
this is a tough one
my friend has an auto body shop and he
likes to hang out there i've been
searching up mechanic courses and sent
them to him asking if he's interested he
got mad at me saying i was judging him
for not having a fancy job but he was
happy with his current job that he can
just go there and go home and he doesn't
want to go to school or put anything
more into what he just considers a means
of survival we got into a fight where i
told him i'm finding it harder to see a
future for us where i'm when i have to
pay for everything in the relationship
he told me i'm just gonna have to accept
him or gtfo and stormed out
well um
hey this uh is another one that seems
like it just kind of sucks i i don't
think people are gonna necessarily agree
with her
but i think she's being fair in the
sense that like
you know it seems like
her future
idea of what she wants her family to
look like is not possible given
you know the job that her partner has
so i think she's kind of basically
coming to the terms
with the fact that they're incompatible
it yes i i agree i mean i'm not saying
they should break up because i don't
know
like
any more about their situation all i'm
saying is it seems like he's like this
is the life that i want to lead and i'm
happy with it and she's like we can't
have a family like this and then it
maybe they should not be together then
thanks for your responses i realize it
does bothers me it does bother me that
i'll have to pay for him if we continue
so i'll let him know tonight we have to
go our separate ways i was attached for
nostalgic reasons just had the talk
weirdly he was shocked i told him i
wanted to break up told me he thought we
actually had it but i ruined it told him
i'd rather ruin it now than be unhappy
he sighed got his stuff and left feeling
kind of relieved actually that was good
good ending
now
do you have to when i always wonder in
these situations do you go to your
significant other and then go
the internet told me to break up with
you
apart from that i'm like this is uh
this seems like the the exact outcome i
would have thought
makes the most sense here
temporarily sad but then
positive from that point onwards
babe they said you're the [ __ ]
i wonder what the votes were here you're
the [ __ ] 50 percent
not the [ __ ] 27
i guess so you know it's cowardly not
the past judgment here
i don't know like i don't i don't i
don't see her as being an [ __ ] here i
see her as wanting something different
i don't think she
look would i be annoyed if
i felt like i was being nagged to get a
better job and then when i was hanging
out with my friend at her at his auto
body shop she sent me a link to like you
know go to mechanic school i'd probably
be a little annoyed yeah
[Laughter]
i would i would take the hint let's put
it that way and be like uh
i'm offended i guess um it sounds like
there were two people who knew what they
wanted and didn't want to compromise and
then they broke up
all i'm saying is if they flipped the
script
and the wife wasn't making that much
money but the husband was bringing for
home 94k do you think reddit would have
said you're the [ __ ] 50 or do you
think they would have said
you know you're carrying some dead
weight she just wants to leech off of
you and uh you know if she doesn't have
any ambition then then she's the [ __ ]
just throwing that out there just just
just offering
i
i've acknowledged that when you flip the
script sometimes it makes my opinion
look worse i think in this one
you must acknowledge it makes my opinion
look a little bit better
am i the [ __ ] for we can only choose
like one more
am i the [ __ ] for contributing to one
of my children's college funds and not
the others um
i it's come on is
hold on
i'm gonna look at three and choose one i
think that's a great idea
preferring one child to another am i the
[ __ ]
am i the [ __ ] for
calling security on student parties even
though i know they'll be charged for the
disturbance i'm not gonna do this one
because i
can without even reading it i'm like
you're not the [ __ ]
[Laughter]
if they're if they're making noise late
at night you can't sleep then you call
security on them
what do you suppose just just go to work
tired so that they can go
until four in the morning
like come on man you did that [ __ ] yeah
and i got noise complainted like
you know multiple times a year
and then when the cops came and said
please like shut the [ __ ] up
we went this is
[ __ ] man and then when we woke up in
the morning we were like oh yeah
actually that makes perfect sense
i could completely understand why
we in their defense we were being quite
loud
maybe our judgment was somewhat clouded
by some beverages that have been imbibed
come on man they're young and enjoying
their youth
i forgot you can't enjoy like the only
part of being young that's fun is being
like loud as hell uh when people are
trying to sleep
like you couldn't possibly like have fun
without cranking the subwoofer 211 in
like a shared living space and uh you
know keeping the party going all night
insanely loudly you couldn't just
you know
quietly have some conversations with one
another until 6 a.m it's only you know
you don't even have to lie it's always a
good time
i've been on both sides of the noise
complaint
argument i've been noise complaining in
university
deserved it every single time no
question about it
that being said will i noise complain to
other people yeah within reason like if
it's 1001 and they're like you know it's
audible i'm not like knock it off it's
like three in the morning and the thing
is it gets louder too as people get
drunker
which is the most annoying part you
think that like it'll be peak
drunkenness and then over time they'll
be like shh
but actually they just they're they
start they turn the music up and then
they they're like i don't know why we're
listening to the music so loud when we
actually wanted to come here to have a
conversation so then they're shouting
and then somebody's like shut the [ __ ]
up i'm trying to listen to the song and
they crank the music and they're like
i'm just gonna try to keep i need to
keep talking over the din and then it's
like a positive feedback loop that never
ends man
stun locked at three
yeah what about my baby like trying to
enjoy her youth by uh actually getting a
good night's sleep
oh i guess like youth only matters when
you're like between the ages of 17 and
21.
if you're under the age of uh of 12 [ __ ]
you you shouldn't be allowed on an
airplane dummy
am i the [ __ ] for losing a friend
over the use of their full name for a
formal wedding invitation
of the three
i got it i gotta go with the college fun
man
do that one okay fine
i'm just i wanna i wanna
i wanna look at it first
just to make sure okay
just oh my god it's so long
i can't even like summarize it with my
eyes
edit for info edit because people keep
asking edit for more info edit for the
best man thing update
update what the [ __ ]
this just
sucks
this one is not good it's not even like
controversial it's just bad
how about this one am i the [ __ ] for
taking three dollars from my little
sister's room
to tip the pizza guy after dad
accidentally didn't tip online
i noticed my sis usually has cash
sitting in a room because she's a cart
prepper for a hotel and gets tips she's
had it sitting out before but she knows
i'd never steal from her well my dad and
i were frantically searching for cash
around the house house because he
accidentally hit cash and not online tip
i texted her if i could grab a few bucks
for him because it's so crappy to not
tip somebody she didn't respond i didn't
see any at first but there was a wipes
container partially popped open that had
some money in it i took three dollars
and let her know right away that i'd pay
her back she woke up
from her friends this morning and is
going ballistic
saying no one was supposed to find that
money and i said i understand absolutely
go ahead and hide it elsewhere i won't
do it again i didn't want to but i felt
the situation called for it
since he was going to be there soon
closest place to get cash back was 20
minutes away she said she no longer
trust me i crossed the line and i'm
starting to feel like i did a very bad
thing to put it into perspective we were
both living there in our early 20s while
she's school and because i just left an
abusive relationship i didn't think she
would get that mad honestly can i tell
you
not not the [ __ ]
i'm stunned that this is 62 you're the
[ __ ] here
like
this
look i know how this comes across okay
i it's three dollars
like i get that
the principle of it is she had money
that she was storing
and she was hiding it she didn't want
anybody to know that it was there that
we can argue the
philosophy of that
all you want
but like
it was found so
like she can be upset that the money was
found
but it is
three dollars
and i i like i i would do this i think
if somehow i mean i'm just going to tell
you straight out this would never happen
to me because before i submit any form
online i look over it like you know 20
times
uh
regardless okay
if let's say kate was away i ordered a
pizza accidentally hit cash
100
i would i would go through the drawers
if i found the 20 i would pay for the
pizza and then i would i mean i wouldn't
be like you know
gotcha
i would be like
hey i just so you know i took a 20 to
pay the pizza guy and i'll give it back
to you like
literally whenever
would you steal money from your baby
i'm telling you straight up if if my
let's assume i had like a 10 year old
child
if my child was asleep
and they had the only cash in the house
with which to tip the pizza delivery
person i would absolutely steal the
money from my child
there's there's no question
and because
it's like a steal
to fulfill this transaction
and then when they wake up you go hey
just so you know i took like the 10
bucks you had on your dresser to pay for
dinner but i'll give it back to you like
today
absolutely
saving this to send to your daughter in
10 years if i raise her right i think
she would agree with me
but if they're a ten-year-old kid what
are they gonna do
they're not gonna get in the car and
drive to the candy store i'm in complete
control of when they have the capacity
to spend the money
i get that you can't just like logician
your way out of every argument but i'd
be like yeah i borrowed look yes i took
your money what are you gonna do with it
you're gonna you're gonna scan it and
then buy v bucks i don't think so
it's cash dummy is is 2031
where are you going to spend cash
does you know you're going to go
uh
walk to the i don't even know to the
mall i don't even know what 10 year olds
buy honestly but you're going to cry
little little goblin junior
i'm just saying this is part of the the
social contract of a family
if if you stole the money never told her
and then when she found it
like that you denied it or something
that makes you an [ __ ] even if it's
three dollars if an unforeseen situation
came up where you needed the money
it's three dollars
which is like
look i'm oversimplifying but if you're
like i need a thousand dollars to pay
for my car repair and you take
somebody's thousand dollars and don't
have the means to pay it back that's a
different story than
three
dollars
is three dollars
we need reddit's opinion
i am i it is stunning that this is 62
you're the [ __ ]
mr moneybags over here that's not even a
tier one subscription man
update i gave her five dollars and she
forgave me i learned a lot from the
critique i wasn't ever trying to double
down on what i did you did borrow three
dollars it's not that big of a deal
i genuinely wanted to understand her
anger and now i do i was wrong
shut up the internet what have you done
to this this young adult here you got
them they're gonna carry this guilt for
the rest of their life first off you
gave her like a 60
return on the loan
in what two days this is the most
incredible investment that's ever
existed in business history and now you
got them tricked into thinking they're
like a total [ __ ]
that's insanity man let's i
you're both in your early twenties
little your little sisters in though for
some reason reddit can't be reached
retry
oh
just kidding
[Laughter]
you went through your sister's stuff
without permission to take money to tip
for a meal your sister did not eat
wasn't even on the premises when it was
ordered or delivered and you're
wondering if you might be the a yes
absolutely you're the a on every front
making your sister financially
responsible for not her meal knowing you
should get permission but not waiting
until you hear back from her
prioritizing a three dollar tip over her
privacy the list goes on i won't regale
you with all the other stuff that
reflects poorly on you instead i'll just
say the list goes on and then who knows
there could be a thousand things on this
list there could be zero more we'll just
put the difference
hey hey hey uh pizza guy here's way i'm
just waiting for a text from my sister
to see if i can go take the three
dollars that i found in a room you're
cool to hang out here for a literally
indeterminate length of time right could
be uh 10 seconds could be 24 hours
and and hear me out here
when the text comes back if everything's
a-okay you get a juicy
three
dollars right in your pocket man
that's crazy just if look you wouldn't
want me to
it it's
so much this okay sorry
you know she should have texted back
faster
hey take the three bucks but save me a
slice
you're the [ __ ]
regardless of the amount it was her
money
i too
judge every situation exclusively by
uh the principles instead of the reality
of the situation
even if it was a single penny
you are
an [ __ ] for taking your sister's
money
even if you needed one penny
to pay
for medicine that you needed urgently to
survive it's her money you should simply
maintain the moral high ground while
dying
your dad should have been able to call
and have a tip added no response does
not equal permission you're the [ __ ]
okay this is actually true
i still don't think it makes you the
[ __ ]
i'm also gonna go ahead and say
that given the choice of taking an un
vetted three dollar loan temporarily or
trying to phone in a tip to the pizza
place i would take the three dollars
because it's just
so much easier
and to me it seems like the odds of this
situation ever coming
to blows like this is so low
you could have very quickly driven to
the as soon as he made the online order
you could have driven to the pizza place
given your plight to them
added a tip
100 by the way or zero because tips i
forget where reddit falls on tips
let me fix it for you am i the a-hole
for snooping through my sister's stuff
to get her hidden stash of money
yes okay i mean look
for snooping yes it depends okay if
there was a wipes container that was
open and you spotted it no problem
if there was uh
if you had to find it under her bed or
something i do then it makes you kind of
an [ __ ] but
i think it's a removal of context
soft you're the [ __ ]
i'm guessing you also entered her room
without permission to can i just say
like [ __ ] off that's too much okay but
like
you're like in your
20s is your family
you entered my room without my
permission
like just
it's just so minor you're the [ __ ]
you had no respect for your sister if i
was her i would get a lock for the
bedroom
i'm sorry you told her to go ahead and
hide her money elsewhere when you
swooped around about it for the first
time question my question my question my
question my question mark this is like a
40 question mark sequence here you're
the [ __ ] not you trying to wash your
hands of this capital offense that
you've committed if i were you i would
i would probably you're on notice or the
police are looking for you not you
trying to absolve yourself of this
terrible grievance that you've uh
created for your totally cause all
because you wanted a little pizza
you're the [ __ ] you didn't get a
response that didn't give you free reign
to just go steal money from her
even if there was the intent to repay it
and even if it's
three dollars which i think we need to
continue to restate is probably about
the cost of the smallest cup of coffee
that you can get at dunkin donuts i'm
just making sure we're all anchored on
this
you know like in the court system
there is uh
you know
petty theft
grand larceny
uh you know armed robbery like based on
the severity of of what
the crime is
you're treated differently like for
three dollars they i mean i guess you
they're not talking about taking it to
court to begin with but they would
probably be like stop wasting my time
is there i'm just wondering if there's
an amount of money like if if people
made this post about a quarter
would people still be going
you're you're an [ __ ] with 10
question marks at the end it's not about
the money or would that at that point
would they be like
it's it's just a quarter i think it i
think there is an amount of money where
people would be like
okay we shouldn't you shouldn't have
even made that post for a nickel really
you're making the post
i guess three dollars is above the
threshold oh here we go grundl stiltskin
everyone in this thread is freaking out
calling you an [ __ ] lol it was only
three bucks you tried to ask her if it
was okay then when you did take it you
told her up you told her up front and
said you'd pay her back the only thing
i'd have done differently here is i
would have gone and gotten the money to
pay her back right away also maybe she
should have said you were looking around
for any loose cash or change in the
house and saw the opec container that's
why you texted her honestly seems like
there's underlying issues in the
relationship i have a good relationship
with my family and if they needed to
take three bucks or mustache in my room
and paid me back i wouldn't take it all
congratulations um

um
you uh breached her privacy prioritize
the three dollar tip over her well-being
the list goes on
38 upvotes it's just three dollars
look dude i'm i'm learning so much i
feel like many people on the subreddit
have never had a relationship with other
people everything is black or white they
have no concept of nuance like yeah by
the dictionary definition
the op did steal but given the context
is it really worth freaking out about i
mean it's three dollars
oh man you're the [ __ ] it's not
really about the fact that it's three
dollars
but
in so many ways
is that not a detail that's germane to
the situation
if it's not about the fact that it's
three dollars hypothetically if you
stole a thousand dollars from her you
would be reacting with the exact same
magnitude
if he stole a thousand dollars would you
be writing the comments saying it's not
about the thousand dollars or would you
be saying you should be in prison it's
literally about the three dollars
on the occasion it would have been
better overall to not tip the driver
source
not the driver
that's is so good people are so dramatic
not the [ __ ] i'm the sibling who
always has cash in my room sometimes if
my mom's in a tight spot where she needs
cash she'll take some and let me know
it's not a big deal you tried to ask
permission but we're short on time you
let her know right away told her you pay
it back i don't see how you betrayed her
trust when she informed when she was
informed as it was happening
i know some families are less close than
others but to be in your 20s living with
your family and throwing a fit because
they borrowed three dollars dot dot dot
dot
you're the [ __ ] the amount doesn't
matter
i love comment deleted by a user it
wouldn't be different whatsoever op
still stole the money
you're the [ __ ] doesn't matter what
your motives were
again not everything has to be similar
to the court system
uh it it doesn't so what what matters
okay the money doesn't matter at all
okay the amount that's stolen has
absolutely no relevance a million
dollars three dollars who cares uh also
it doesn't matter what you were doing
with it if you were doing it for pizza
that's one thing if you were doing it
for uh life-saving medicine that's one
thing if you were doing it to buy v
bucks that's why it's all the same
no one should ever steal money didn't
your parents teach you anything
i live my life by a code
you ever hear only a sith deals in
absolutes you're the [ __ ] you stole
from her and are surprised she doesn't
trust you anymore
he's three
it's three dollars
and
he he gave her five dollars back
i'll say not the [ __ ] because in the
grand scheme of things this isn't a big
deal in fact it would be hard to find
something that's a smaller deal everyone
needs to chill
i definitely think that's fair
on the other hand you're the [ __ ] it
now makes sense why she hides her money
sure you did the right thing by texting
to ask if you could borrow cash the fact
that you got no response would mean no
so you violated her privacy and stole
from her if it was so important to tip
the pizza guy why didn't you phone her
you have broken the law
am i the only one thinking not the
[ __ ] no but we're we're a dying breed
apparently
everyone else is part of the context
collapse
you're the [ __ ] you're the [ __ ]
your sister needs to put her money
someplace else so you don't go in there
and taking it
she knows i'd never steal from her now
she knows for a fact that you would
you're the [ __ ] i'm i'm losing my
mind you're the [ __ ] you technically
stole
i get not tipping is bad but it's not
worse than stealing even if you intended
to pay her back you still stole and you
didn't have permission to touch it are
you telling me you didn't have some
change in your own room even if it was
in coins to make the tip yourself your
your dad also didn't no cash app or
anything you could have handled it with
you're telling me that you thought you
had a close enough relationship with
your sister because you've grown up
together for 20 years that you could
borrow the sum of a small cup of coffee
from her pay her back before she even
returned home and have her not get upset
about it are you [ __ ] stupid
you touched her piece of paper that
symbolizes that she can give this to a
person at a store
and in return she can get an eight ounce
cup of brown liquid
even if you give her the three dollars
back it's not the same three dollars
you must be brain dead they're distinct
pieces of paper
it's not about the money
it's not about what you were gonna do
with it
it has absolutely nothing to do with any
of those things that clearly make this
apparent to any normal person that this
is not a big deal what it is instead is
a very black and white issue
are you pro-grand larceny
or are you
a moral person
personally as a redditor i see myself as
a moral person i would never steal
anything uh except every hollywood movie
and television program that's ever come
out but that's different that's
different stealing quotation marks my
mistake
if it were me i'd like to think i'd be
annoyed but understanding if i got paid
back since i used to work as a server i
understand people survive on their tips
that being said i get not tipping is bad
but it's not worse than stealing
especially uh when you completely
collapse the nuance of the situation
i get that not tipping is bad but it's
not worse than stealing three dollars
from your sister and then paying her
back in a day um anyway i understand why
your sister's angry
source dude just trust me anyway that's
react court um



hey everybody it's been a while welcome
back uh to react court we're actually
sorted by the top posts of the month
right now would you look at that
because it's been since labor day
at least well since the week before
labor day
when i was able to uh to do some react
court last week
i naively thought
after a lifetime of not really
interfacing much with triple a games i
thought the death loop would change that
for
me the week before that was labor day i
took that time off
so we're back here
um
i'm not insulting death loop okay i'm
i'm not trying to
i'm not trying to be rude okay let's
take a look at this i'm happy to be back

okay
am i the [ __ ] for calling the police
on my flatmate kid knocking on my door
this is one of those times i believe i
need a british or australian translator
a mate is a friend
a flat is an apartment
what is a flatmate kid it's a friend of
yours who's two dimensional it's a
roommate's oh i'm my roommate's child i
was making a joke i thought maybe this
was someone in their apartment complex
that was like knocking on their door
it's their roommate's child okay
let's check it out am i the [ __ ] for
calling the police on my flatmate kid
disclaimer not in the usa
not in the usa
i f22 live in a shared house with the
landlord and his two sons and a woman
and her daughter
is it
by any chance uh
do they all have hair of gold
like their mother the youngest one in
curls
this is a joke about the brady bunch i
apologize
yesterday the landlord plus his kids
were away visiting some family and the
other woman works a crazy schedule i was
sleeping in my room when i woke up by
the kids screaming like crazy at about
2am i figured the mother was not home so
i put on my headphones but in a few
minutes she was banging on my door still
screaming and crying okay let's start
that sucks that sucks that's not a nice
situation that's a bit of a toxic living
situation
i panicked thinking something horrible
was going on outside so i shut myself in
my room's bathroom and called the police
they could hear the screaming on the
call so they came very quickly all right
that is
probably what i would describe as a
little bit of an overreaction
an eight-year-old child that you are
familiar with is screaming and banging
on your door your response was to lock
yourself in the bathroom and call the
police
i do i mean
so you
i'm not trying to argue because this is
like a self-driving car situation but
it's like you know
i'm not saying you have to give up
your life to protect your landlord's
child
all i'm saying is
you are the steward of the child safety
of the situation whether you should be
there or not the fact that you got so
scared of the situation they were in you
locked yourself in the bathroom and
called the police is at the very least a
little funny it's a little a little
humorous
um they heard the screaming so they came
very quickly turns out the kid had a
nightmare and was really scared and the
paramedics had to put some medicine in
her to calm her down then the police
asked me a lot of questions and i
explained our living situation did i
know where the mother was i told them i
was not aware the kid was alone because
the mother has a crazy schedule i
provided her phone number but they
couldn't reach her so they took the kid
to the police station
i went back to sleep and woke up by the
mother banging on my door and screaming
at me for what happened yesterday she
said the police won't give her daughter
back and i'm an [ __ ] for calling them
for something as silly as a nightmare i
should have just calmed the kid down
instead of making it a huge deal
i told her it's not my responsibility to
take care of her daughter i barely
interact with any of them and i was not
going to open my door to someone
screaming like crazy because it could be
dangerous i think it was the right
choice to call the police but i told the
situation to my mother and she says
either way i should have checked on the
kid because sharing a house also means
helping out with this kind of thing
okay um this story is
is sad
but
uh also
kind of i i can't get over
her hearing a kid screaming and then
just going to the bathroom with their
headphones in and being like
uh toby maguire i miss the part where
that's my problem let me just say first
it this definitely seems like i don't
know if i would feel comfortable saying
everybody sucks here but uh
this situation sucks for everybody here
can we flip that script around
there's
one two three four five there's six
people living in this house
that range from eight
to
old enough to have two sons
oh well i i you know
likely
it's just
it's a bit of a strange situation okay
one family a landlord and two sons a
woman and her daughter and then just one
random unrelated
22 year old
that's just a very unusual living
situation i feel like
you don't see too much
it seems like this this person is
already put in a toxic spot and i have
some sympathy for them for that um hey
mercy thank you thank you
i guess i mean look
i don't know what to say
about this one do i think that this
person
uh
did what they should have done in that
situation no
you if you hear
an eight-year-old child screaming
like i kind of feel like even if it's a
stranger's child
the adult thing to do is be like hey
what's wrong and if you get killed you
just kind of hope that there's like a
heaven because whatever you've done in
your life
sacrificing your life to like make sure
that a child is safe it would get you
through the pearly gates imo
and then if the then you could just
haunt the person who killed you if
that's how it happened but if it's
somebody you know
especially i think that's like an extra
obligation right like i'm not saying
this person is taking like the ultra
libertarian approach of like sorry
sister you're eight years old and your
mom went to work now you enjoy being
self-reliant i'm not saying that they're
taking that opinion i'm just saying
you know i i think that when you have a
an awareness of this child when they're
a part of your life you have more of a
if not an obligation at least more of an
incentive to be like hey you know what's
going on
like at least talk to the kid through
the door or something i wouldn't want to
be in this situation either is very
uncomfortable
um
that being said
i don't think i'm comfortable saying
that they're an [ __ ] for this
i mean i feel like this is one of those
things you ever hear the expression that
[ __ ] rolls downhill like if we're trying
to track
[ __ ] zero the first [ __ ] that made
everything else shitty
you gotta go like a a a ways up the
situation here right this person that
called the police i don't think they
took the first [ __ ] so who took the
first [ __ ] well oh the mom's got weird
hours and that makes it uh impossible
for her to be there for her kid okay but
her mom
probably didn't willfully take this
position that has weird hours you know
so like how the heck did this happen and
all of a sudden you're going back to
like you know
adam smith or something like that you're
going back to like the dawn of modern
economics you're going back to the the
first caveman who exchanged like some
some nuts for some meats like i don't
know how far back you're going here um
i i would say
here's what i would say okay this is a
new one for me we're starting we're
starting a positive situation like this
is this is novel
it's and everyone sucks here but i also
think you're not the [ __ ] for sucking
because this just seems like a a chaotic
situation
where people are going to act in an
unpredictable fashion
so i think op acted in a strange fashion
in a fashion that was
somewhat inappropriate but also
understandable given the amount of chaos
that's afoot here
we go this is one of the most divided
posts i've ever seen
40 not the [ __ ] 32 percent you're the
[ __ ] 25 everybody sucks here
that's like
that's almost one-third one-third
one-third that's crazy
let me let me see what's going on here
i my if i had to read
like a redditer through my mind with esp
in advance
um
i
guarantee like this is uh top post is
why wasn't the mom there it's the mom's
responsibility
i find it odd your immediate response to
hearing a crying child is to lock
yourself up and call the police without
even attempting to check on the child
yeah it's not your kid and not your
responsibility and the mother obviously
shouldn't have left your child home
alone but damn that's some really
selfish behavior
i want to say you're the [ __ ] but i
have to lean more towards everybody
sucks here mother's in the wrong for
leaving your kids solo but you're
definitely wrong for not even checking
on the kid and taking care of yourself
based
you are this is a based
result
user received gold for this post up
votes really
for all those saying
oh wait what the heck for all those
saying they used crying kids to trap
women for sex trafficking op literally
said it's a shared house that they all
live in and she knew it was her
roommate's kid is that true
that's the kind of stuff look i that's
the kind of stuff i don't mean to be
rude but like my grandma posted on on
facebook
she she'll post something that's like if
you
see duct tape on your car door handle
run in the opposite direction it's a
common human trafficking scam where
while you rip the duct tape off your
door handle they grab you and and take
you away
it happens all the time and i'm like
grandma come on that's not gonna go down
at the cataract way town center
come on
i mean i'm not saying it's never
happened
all i'm saying is is it's not happening
like outside of the moxie's on gardner's
road okay
plus i would just if you put duct tape
on my door it wouldn't matter to me
because the bugatti veyron doors are
actually um they're they're gull wings
so i don't have to use the the handle i
have keyless entry and then they go funk
anybody tries to human traffic me
they're getting uppercutted by the
bugatti door
anyway um i mean this is just this is
not an insane it's an insane story in
the way that they reacted but it's more
like i can't put myself in their shoes
right if i lived in
uh let's call it like you know like a a
duplex environment and i heard a child
screaming
and it was my neighbor's kid
i would go and be like hey what's wrong
because
that i'm the the responsibility is
inherited by me in that situation
if i was 22 years old and i lived with
um my landlord and their two kids and
then a random lady and her kid as well
and then it was two in the morning and i
went i just heard ah
i i probably wouldn't have uh
locked myself in the bathroom i think i
would have i would have tweeted first i
would have been like check this out what
if i if i die please avenge me twitter
um but
i can understand that if i put myself in
her shoes i might react in a different
way because this seems like a very
chaotic situation
so more power
more power to her i guess
but it sucks i mean really like it sucks
for the kid man
she can't get her kid back from the
police yeah but that like okay that's
not really like um
the 22 year olds faults
that's kind of like the police
the police's fault
or like i
like toby mcguire i miss the part where
that's my problem
like it's that's between the police and
the mom as far as i'm concerned like i
think if you
uh
are like hey the cops won't give me my
kid back and it's your fault cause you
called them there's like a self report
in there
that is like hey thanks for calling the
police on my negligence
now as a result of you ratting on my
negligence i'm facing punishment for my
actions
but anyway the timeouts
it all it happens every time
it's just like it's the classic uh i
don't even know what they said i'm not
like
going in on them i'm just saying it
that's what happens oh i know what it is
yeah yeah it's the filter okay it's not
mods it's the filter
okay we're going back here
we're going back
interesting start a lot of [ __ ] ones
right off the bat oh man
i'm just scrolling down a little check
this out am i the [ __ ] for telling my
stepson's bumble date that she should
focus on her career and children rather
than dating men like my stepson
[Laughter]
oh man
oh it's been a good month huh
for my whole life i never okay sorry am
i the [ __ ] for freaking out at my mom
after finding out who my biological
father is for my whole life i never knew
who my biological father was my mom and
family have always been super secret
recently my mom decided to tell me as i
just turned 16 and she felt i was old
enough to know
she sat me down in the living room and
told me my bio dad was her ex stepfather
aka my grandmother and her ex-husband
my my my aka my grandmother's ex-husband
my grandmother's ex-husband is my dad
i need i'm just picturing it in a
diagram form okay
i felt extremely disgusted and
disappointed and said
why no wonder grandma hates being around
you you couldn't keep your legs closed
long enough to keep away from grandma's
husband
look this can't be real
i
i believe that this story could take
place
but there is no way
that as soon as she heard the news she
just owned her mom like that there's no
chance
i do i don't believe
that you would just lie and then again
it is that's the 16 year old
uh stereotype is just lighting people up
but
i'm completely disgusted with you i said
a lot of other stuff i wasn't really
kind with my words my mom cried i'm
really sorry my actions ended up hurting
a lot of people it's something i live
with every day just know that my actions
don't define you i told my mom to save
her words i never thought in a million
years this would be the outcome
okay i mean
the way my grandma acts around me how
the only times i ever go to her house or
on holidays when my younger siblings go
to her house a lot more
i mean this is just a sad story
i
i'm just leaving
i'm just i don't believe it necessarily
to begin with but i'm also just like i
don't want to touch this with a 10-foot
pole
that's just
that's just a disaster
uh
there's some great ones here man
am i the [ __ ] for telling my wife not
to clean so angrily
oh man
interesting start so far am i the
[ __ ] for telling my stepson's bumble
date that she should focus on her career
rather than children rather than dating
men like my stepson
i think this is just like a rule of
thumb this is a heuristic anytime
uh you tell
a woman at all and i guess a man but i
feel like it happens a lot less often
but any time you tell a woman to
hurry up and have kids you're really
going to be
operating from behind the eight ball
uh when it comes to being on the moral
high grounds
i think that that you know that's very
personal
business
oh
if she already has kids then well maybe
let's let's read through maybe let's
just read then
for context my 36 year old steps oh my
this person is 36 they got a 19 year old
stepson i was i don't know who to relate
to
i'm i'm okay i guess i'm like basically
the same age as the dad
all right
my stepson lives at home with my wife
and i
last weekend i found a woman in my
living room
after i woke up in the morning she had
slept over in my step-son's room my
step-son was still asleep he normally
sleeps in late on the weekends when i
first came downstairs she was crying on
the phone i proceeded to introduce
myself
hello there
i just didn't picture that
hello uh
welcome to my home
uh i proceeded to introduce myself she
said she was on the phone with her
mother who was taking care of her son
while she was staying over with my
stepson i proceeded to ask if she knew
my stepson through his job and she said
they met through bumble
sorry they met online bumble
we talked a bit more and due to reasons
i will explain i ultimately told her
that she should not be prioritizing
dating especially men like my stepson
and should instead focus on her career
and spending more time with her son
here's the thing
my stepson has been living with my wife
and i since he graduated high school
over a year ago he's handsome tall and
in shape due to his full-time work as a
swimming instructor and lifeguard [ __ ]
[ __ ] [ __ ]
[ __ ]
sexy
dick bag
chad
just picture him his tight red shorts
and his
his glistening body given those swimming
lessons
that's not me putting on a character by
the way i'm mad
since he graduated he has brought
numerous women over to our house at
least 20 but i have lost count now and
not always aware due to working sporadic
hours
good good for him
i guess at first my wife and i were
surprised about how he was meeting them
he barely has enough time to date and
uses most of his free time in his room
playing video games when we confronted
him about it he said he just uses online
dating to set up dates and brings them
to our house or drives to them
why do you this is just a
a simple question i guess from somebody
that exists
in between 36 year old dad and 19 year
old stepson
why do you need to confront your stepson
for this this is not no no no this is
not as bad
as
security camera dad who was like you
can't if you don't get home by 11 just
sleep on the street this dad just seems
like
i mean maybe a little curious
i just don't understand why you got to
confront your son for going on a lot of
dates or you know let's be honest just
making your basement sound like animal
planet three or four times a week oh
okay hold on last year he had two
pregnancy scares which he handled
himself something something tells me
that there may have been another person
involved in these pregnancy scares but
that maybe that's just my
my theory uh furthermore a few months
ago i noticed he kept bringing back two
different women to our house in
alternation
although i've always been a monogamous
monogamous long-term relationship type
of guy i understand the whole gist the
young men sew in their wild oats my wife
doesn't seem to mind as long as it's
safe however i feel like my stepson
might not be being completely
transparent with his dates and i
currently believe he's not a good
candidate for young single mothers you
got to get a hobby my man that's just
crazy
what do you want to be like his
administrative assistant
like we know when you go into a doctor's
office you got to like fill out a form
and do an interview with the
the front desk about why you're there
it's like you know hey
welcome to my son's uh bedroom before if
you could just take a seat right there
he'll be right with you first i just
want you to know he does tend to bring
back women in an alternating fashion um
i do need to ask about you personally do
you have any children what are your
career plans etc etc
am i in the wrong for interjecting and
diverting this young single mother away
from her current situation with my
stepson i believe that her son will
greatly benefit from her taking a break
with dating and spending more time with
him
it's just like
it's just none of your business this you
are you are the [ __ ]
for sure it's not that big of a deal
like you're not a a turbo [ __ ] but
just like chill out
like it's not you're you're not the
person who controls everybody else's
life and decisions you know just let
them let them live their lives you can
give advice but
you you working as this weird like
arbitrator of
how people should spend their time is
very strange to clarify i would the big
weirdo energy i will admit i have a
protective urge when it comes to single
mothers
tell me you don't have like a
a t-shirt that says like
i don't even want to make it up but
[Laughter]
so if you mess with the queen you have
to deal with the king's army or
something like that
um
okay so his wife has been in therapy due
to abusive relationships this it's fair
while i'm not saying my stepson is
abusive i do not believe that the
hook-up culture he's engaging in is
healthy for a young single mother with
her whole future ahead of ahead of her
children and career come first in my
opinion
this i i feel like a lot of people
uh run into this uh
confluence of confusion
you can have an opinion that's no
problem
it's when you start to
not just tell it to other people but act
like you're coming from on high with
this like advice plus like dude just
you're 36.
i like i don't know if if you are of the
opinion that makes you some grand old uh
sage or something like that you're still
like
basically a little kid it's actually
kind of you and your child are basically
peers
you're
not yet but in like 10 years you're
going to be the same age
which is a you know something to keep in
perspective
you're in no position like if it was
like an 80 year old grandma or something
like that and she's like here's my
advice you would be like first off she's
coming from a place of a lot of lived
experience but also secondarily like
you know
whatever grandma go go back and watch
live with michael strahan or whatever
who's even on live with regis and kelly
now um
you just gotta
you know you can there's a difference
between having an opinion and my opinion
is is kind of for the record she can do
whatever she wants but i also i'm like
when do you have your you're a single
mom i'm not saying you can't have any
fun well i know you know i was gonna say
i i agree with him a little but i
actually don't there's you know you you
can go out and have some fun if you have
your child being handled responsibly by
a babysitter it doesn't he he has an
assumption i guess in this post that is
like she's going out all the time
and getting
you know railed by random lifeguards and
being an irresponsible
parent
most of the
railing is probably happening
past the child's bedtime anyway
there's no reason that those things
can't be
uh compatible with one another in a
24-hour day
it just seems like you could fit both of
them in responsibly and still be like a
good parent
anyway yeah you're you're the [ __ ]
i've the more i talk about it the more
i'm like it's just weird that you
this seems like the kind of guy he
becomes like the he's dwight schrute
right like he's he's dwight schrute and
his son is jim halpert and now he
michael scott is allowing him to have
the smallest modicum of power
over his son and he's like
are you sure you should be doing all
that [ __ ] like it's just
it's just weird
don't date my son if you want a
long-term relationship okay great very
honest
don't date at all be a mother you're the
[ __ ] that's definitely true
okay yeah we i know i know user received
gold for this post shooting stars reddit
silver up dudes really
you're the [ __ ] who are you to assume
she doesn't spend enough time with her
son because she spent a single night at
someone else's absolutely true yes
you're the [ __ ] single mothers are
allowed to date and even have one night
stance you want to warn her that your
stepson is a freak boy go right ahead
that's true yeah
you could be like hey my stepson's kind
of a piece of garbage it makes you kind
of an [ __ ]
instead of
doing that you're like uh you know you
should be a better mom that's a little
not not the [ __ ] but situations like
this
oh no it's the
it's the the realtor
not you're not the [ __ ] uh sores dude
just trust me
but situations like this are beyond
uncomfortable if i were you i would not
let the stepson bring flings over
look okay
he's 19 years old in the economic
reality
of 2021 is very different than it was in
like 19
you know 52 okay
in 1952
the
window of time where somebody
was capable of making an informed
decision about copulating
and also the window of which they were
able to
maybe get their own property or at least
like move out on their own there was
probably like a
it's a narrow window of a couple of
years nowadays people are you know with
real estate prices so insane rent's so
insane
covered to begin with i mean covet broke
out when this guy was like 17 years old
maybe you know you kids are not going to
be leaving home until they're in their
mid-20s maybe later you got to come up
with some kind of uh situation like some
kind of agreement in the in the hotel of
mom and dad
to allow this stuff to happen otherwise
i think you're just being kind of
ignorant at this point
like it's gonna happen
this is a
like south korea which is like the only
other country i'm familiar with has the
same thing going on where like you're
not supposed to uh stay over with your
boyfriend or girlfriend until you're
married but that's like not realistic so
instead they go out to like uh
karaoke rooms you know dvd bongs which
is like where you go and watch a movie
and then you just do it in there and
then some poor
like minimum wage staff has to clean up
your stain instead of the way god
intended which is that your mom finds it
when she washes your sheets four days
later like
just get over it
it's just it's just
the the idea that you would be like you
can't bring
prospective romantic partners over
is just like complete denialism to me at
least
i don't understand
big plus two oh thank you thank you i it
felt
it felt good when the metal straw hits
oh man
oh
you're the [ __ ] um you're the [ __ ]
i know i want to see some psychos man
you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ]
why was she crying also you're the
[ __ ] you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ]
info okay yeah no that's fair
um
oof you're the [ __ ]
i'm
i i just hate to
this is a
flashpoint issue that causes a lot of
disagreement which is fine okay this is
a safe place to disagree
but i am always surprised at the amount
of people who are like if it makes you
uncomfortable ask him to keep it out of
the house and then somebody else replies
this is the best comment if op's
uncomfortable with his son bringing
strangers into the home he needs to take
it up with him not the strangers
the the his house his rules stuff like i
do get it and
i i just disagree when it's like your
child
i'm not saying that your child should be
allowed to like do arson in the home or
you know consistently bring home sketchy
strangers who like rob you but
it's
so why is so much of am i the [ __ ]
like disputes about real estate as if
like you're the king of the castle
instead of situations that are like
you know everybody in this house has to
live
under one roof we've all got a you know
that that's that's what it's like to
live with other people in in castle
ravani exactly
you do some [ __ ] i guarantee you that
annoys the hell out of your son okay
you probably mow the lawn at like 7 40
a.m on a sunday or something like that
but you just get to go you know my house
my rules and then your son doesn't even
he's not even causing you any problems
based on your post he's just you know
laying pipe and maybe you're a little
bit jealous or something like that and
now you're you're you're blowing up his
spot constantly and then all not only
blowing up his spot but then telling his
romantic partners to be better mothers
like it's
everybody's gotta
get along in these situations why is it
always like well my name's on the deed
so i will enforce my will on this
domicile like just
don't homeowners don't be
like weird tyrants 2021 challenge
i mean i pay the mortgage i get my way
in my own house like 20 percent of the
time
i'm thankful for it
i just i'm i'm just out here trying to
survive man
[Laughter]
you'd be fine if your daughter in 19
years brought back the whole band of
nickelback look it's easy to say in
principle
we could not make that it there would be
a space problem it wouldn't be on
immoral grounds or or taste or anything
like that we just we don't live in a
place that's large enough to sustain
what like what would at that point be
eight adults
when you include my family this place
cannot fit eight people
you could do it like one at a time
maybe over the course of a week
do some kind of rotation or something
like that but not simultaneously it's
not like a a permission thing it's more
that like i don't
want to have to like ask chad kroger to
like oh no i'm going that way hey chad i
know you're standing in front of the
fridge like doing a text but like i need
to move i need to get some water from
the fridge right like
cut his mic cut his mic
okay
am i the [ __ ] for asking my wife not
to clean so angrily
i love this
i love this because i i think that i've
i can relate already and i i love it
even more because he has been judged in
the way that i judge myself
oh
this is a recurring issue that happens
regularly often leads to fights last
night it happened again my wife is a bit
of a neat freak her cleaning standards
are definitely higher than mine i've
tried to adapt and clean more often it's
not a problem for me i don't mind
cleaning most of the time the issue is
that it's hard to predict when messes
will set her off and send her into a
spiral of angry cleaning
here's what happened yesterday we got
back from a trip to costco we're both
exhausted i unload the car and put the
perishables away before i leave
everything before but i leave everything
else out to take care of later then i go
to decompress and play video games
before bed all right let me tell you
brother we were we
take it from a wise old sage at age 32.
everything up to this point
you have some defensibility
you've got a
you've got a lot of sympathy however as
soon as you and i under i know what
you're gonna say in response to this
because i have the conversation with
myself okay
when you're putting the groceries away
you gotta do the whole thing okay
you can't because because it's a shot
along the bow to put half of the
groceries away and leave the other half
out because what you're saying basically
is i've already done enough it's your
time now to do this other 50
the way that this
accounting the credits and the debits of
household work do in a married household
is that
you put you do the whole chore and then
you mentally keep track of it and you go
i put the groceries away i did the whole
thing i get one short credit and then
you have discussions about how to
exchange those credits and settle the
accounts later if
like th
here's the thing if my wife was like we
need to vacuum and mop this weekend
and then
she did half of the vacuuming at her own
convenience and then knocked on my
office door and gave me the vacuum and
was like your turn i would be upset
because i'm like i
basically you're saying like you chose
when it gets done and then you're
forcing me to do it when you want me to
do it instead
you vacuum everything and then later you
go hey i vacuumed you can mop now and i
mop when it fits nicely into my day
otherwise because if you leave half of
the groceries out
you did half of a chore but you also
left a mess when you didn't have to
you you
instead of
making the place clean which like which
is the goal for a neat person
you left the place messy in order for
the chores to be done in an equitable
fashion which is like putting the cart
before the horse and i say that as
somebody who's been there many times
i know everyone's like capitalist
marriage sounds exhausting tell me you
got 25 yellow mcdonald's paper fillet of
fish wrappers on your office uh or
bedroom floor without telling me
tell me you got a bunch of uh empty
soda bottles on your floor without
telling me you got a bunch of empty soda
bottles on your floor
i have 10 empty water bottles in my room
oh man
not me it's maybe like three or four um
but i leave everything else out to take
care of later then i go to decompress
and play video games before bed look i'm
not policing his enjoyment but sometimes
i do this too i'm like oh i'm so tired i
just need to play some video games
before bed just to relax then i'm on
rocket league like wow wow wow wow wow
nice shot nice shot wow what a save wow
sorry honey i can't i can't do the
chores i'm just decompressing wow wow
um anyway
the thing that set my wife off was a
moldy piece of fruit on the count on the
counter understood
it's a caffeine burp i apologize
understandable it's gross
it should just be thrown away right
it's not so simple
something tells me that this runs a
little deeper than they had originally
alluded to my wife gardens and she hates
just throwing things away she has
several different compost bins
and she likes to save fruit seeds to
grow them she's gotten upset with me
before for throwing away old fruit she
was saving for something so i hadn't
thrown away this piece of fruit that she
put there because i wanted to check with
her to see what she wanted to do with it
so she goes to the kitchen for something
sees the moldy fruit in the boxes and
decides the kitchen is a mess she starts
to angry clean i can hear her in the
living room huffing and puffing and
slamming things i feel like an [ __ ]
because now i'm playing video games
while my exhausted wife cleans the whole
kitchen but i really wanted to just
relax go to bed and take care of
everything the next day anyway i suck it
up go to the kitchen to try to convince
my wife to just go to bed and let me
clean everything i tell her basically
that it's really stressful when she
angry cleans and i think she needs a
better way to manage her anger
the best the best laid plans of mice and
men
she gets more upset and we have our
standard fight am i the [ __ ] here i
feel like it's reasonable to point out
how the way my wife copes with stress
and anger doesn't ever seem to make her
less stressed and angry and when she
radiates anger when she's upset it's
really stressful to be around her okay
like
i get that is frustrating
like genuinely
but
i think you gotta have like you gotta
put yourself in her shoes for like
at least five seconds and be like you
like it you're you're wired in a certain
way you want things to always be clean
and tidy they're not clean and tidy and
it seems like it's because your husband
was like
i can just put away this stuff tomorrow
i'm gonna go play some video games which
is true like you could still put him
away tomorrow don't get me wrong but you
could also just not up for like five
seconds and put him away then and then
play the video games
five minutes later okay
but then notwithstanding
like
you're so she if you put yourself in her
shoes right she's
mad that she has to put some extra stuff
away she's she's mad that it's unclean
so she starts to clean herself
by the way and i can't say this for
certain
but i'm going to imagine that maybe she
is passive aggressively cleaning a
little bit
and making more noise than you know it
would be necessary
but i would also wouldn't be surprised
if it's a little bit of the husband's
guilt
manifesting itself as like when she
makes noise
while cleaning it's because she wants me
to feel bad that i didn't do the thing
that deep down i know that i probably
should have done to begin with so maybe
there's a and i'm this i'm putting my
own projection on there's a little bit
of column a and a little bit of column b
is my expectation
but either way
the wrong time
to be like hey honey
i don't think it's healthy
for
you to get your
anger out by doing cleaning the wrong
time to bring that up is when she's in
the middle of cleaning
because like like it or not i'm not
saying this is fair
but if your
way of decompressing from stress
is cleaning you have a huge moral high
ground
what are people going to be like oh stop
blowing off steam making the dishes
[ __ ] and span
like that's you you really need to come
at that situation from a delicate
situation from a delicate position
um because of the fact that she's
basically doing
combined household labor as a way of
getting her stress out so she's gonna be
like probably a little bit annoyed with
you that she felt like she had to clean
but at the same time you it's like
telling someone who's who's
already a little upset to calm down
right it's like you can't
expect that to work it's just like
throwing gasoline onto the fire
but also i know that this like
we're getting back into like the
capitalist marriage lamar point but like
you gotta just put the groceries away
i do that myself all the time
like i i rationalize it myself because
my wife and i have different
standards of cleanliness
and over time
i've slowly
moved in her direction but it's like
it's a learning process and it happens
through habit like ins there were times
when i was like a bachelor i would do
the same thing you get home from the
grocery store you put your ice cream in
the freezer you leave the other
groceries on your counter
for like
a week who cares and then you rather
than take two minutes to put the the
groceries away you'd rather get in like
a 15 minute argument about it right oh
sure let me waste all my time moving the
crackers from the counter to the cabinet
where then when i want them i'll take
them from the cabinet and then put it on
the counter that seems like a really
good use of my time but then like when
you get older you're like i'm just gonna
do it because it like looks nice
it's just like it's the right thing to
do it looks tidy like is the point of
there's like a fundamental
psychological difference i think between
neat people and dirty people let's not
say dirty even though i can't count
myself in that group let's say
untidy
use whatever word you want to use for it
okay
i
look at chores as a list of things that
have to be done
if i vacuum on sunday
and then i see cat hair on monday my
brain goes
i'll get it next sunday right i vacuumed
yesterday i'm not gonna vacuum again
you know the point of
of
vacuuming is is so that i can get it
done and then like live my life
neat people on the other hand see
cleanliness or tidiness as an ideal
state to be maintained
as much as is conceivably possible
without compromising your quality of
life too much
and that it's the the fundamental
conflict i think comes from those two
people
or
that those two differences in opinion
like for me
and
i'm speaking frankly here i vacuumed
yesterday
sometimes like i'll vacuum on a sunday
and then i'll hear the vacuum going
on monday and i'm like my first thought
is like why the hell did i even vacuum
yesterday
if kate's just gonna vacuum today like i
could have saved 20 minutes by not
vacuuming yesterday if she's gonna
vacuum today but then her
like
viewpoint of this situation is
now that like the vacuuming has been
done everything is clean it only takes a
little bit of extra effort to keep
things clean when i see cat hair i'll
just vacuum it up and it takes 10
minutes
you know it's just differences in
opinion
what you should not do is you know
go to
[Laughter]
first off go to reddit but then also
like
i don't know like
in the when she's in the middle of
cleaning to be like
why please stop cleaning
that this is not the right time to bring
that up
you gotta know you're getting into
a disastrous bit of territory there
also like
i don't know like there's a i i am not
like an alpha male i do not impose my
will
uh in this household very often but
there is a part of me that's like
you gotta at least like grow a little
bit of a backbone
for for your marriages sake in this
situation
like it's not so simple to just throw
out a moldy piece of fruit my wife
gardens and she hates just throwing
things away she likes to save fruit
seeds to grow them she's gotten upset at
me before for throwing away old fruit
she was saving for something okay that's
where you gotta say like
are you really mad at me for throwing
away this moldy ass apricot
like you at that point you gotta
you gotta be like this is garbage
if you want it do something with it
otherwise i'm gonna continue to throw
away stuff that's obviously gone bad you
gotta at least stand up to for yourself
a little bit in a situation like this
also like okay i threw out your apricot
i'll just go to the store and get you
another apricot and let it go bad like
big deal
you just gotta talk it out man like
that's kind of crazy or yeah it takes
two seconds to be like hey do you want
these seeds
anyway
look i can relate to this guy but he is
definitely the [ __ ]
this is
just because i can see myself in the
post doesn't mean he's not the [ __ ]
in this situation um i would also i
think this is one of those things where
when you read it from his perspective
you're like it seems like you might be
the [ __ ] but also simultaneously i
can understand where you're coming from
i bet if you heard it from her
perspective
he would wither like uh like a freaking
raisin man i bet her perspective is like
my
lazy ass
husband we got home from costco we're
both tired i went to clean the bathrooms
he put away half of the groceries which
took like 30 seconds and then i saw him
playing rocket league on on the pc
with like eight bags of groceries from
costco just staring me in the face so
obviously i got upset
because things were messy and then i
went to tidy and he was like oh don't
tidy it makes me feel bad because i it
makes me feel like i didn't do my part
you know it's like
again
i'm the
i'm the op basically
just saying
omg stop cleaning lull
i'm just saying you gotta
if you read it from her perspective i
bet that this reads a little bit less
generously um
but i gotta i gotta see how this looks
man i gotta see how this looks
neither one of you are [ __ ] but you
suck at communicating yeah yeah okay
you're a normal person congratulations
dude if you would have just said to your
wife
hey i'm gonna put that stuff away
tomorrow and go on wine before bed that
cool with you oh and hey about that
piece of fruit right there or if she
would have said hey can you pause and
help me finish up the kitchen so i can
relax by not having a [ __ ] up kitchen
then this [ __ ] would not have escalated
but you both screwed up by not talking
to each other
yeah it seems fair
where's where's op
i
this is just i if i if react court could
have like one lesson
it would really from my perspective it
would be
you need to recognize that just because
the person wrote the account that
doesn't mean you have all the
information in like both perspectives
it's like i hate when people write this
the problem is people usually get to the
point of op's wife when talking doesn't
work like you don't you don't know that
there's like 6 billion people
on the seven billion people on the
planet like there's a lot of people are
uniquely weird in their own ways like
you you read like
three paragraphs and you're like i've
met this person in my real life i know
exactly what you're talking about like
just just chill man
anyway um
oh i angry clean i angry clean because
we've had the conversation multiple
times the conversation about doing an
equal load the conversation about how
i'd also prefer to rest when i get in or
get up the conversation about doing
these tasks when they need to be done
and how it makes both our lives better i
angry clean because it solves the
immediate problem and maybe when i get a
chance to rest i can think about having
the conversation again you're the
[ __ ]
i told you that it would look different
from the wife's perspective
so if a non-perishable if it's a
non-perishable when does it need to get
put away if it's just in your head that
it has to be done right away you can't
be mad at someone else about that the
fact is you want it put away
right away i live in a in a cube
i eat all my meals off of a paper towel
on the floor
why is the society tells you you need
tables and chairs cabinets and cupboards
nah drawers are you crazy i leave
everything
easily out laid in a 16 by 16 grid on
the floor i know exactly where
everything is
and every time why leave stuff on the
counter why not just complete the task
not everyone has the energy to just yet
honey
look i chad i don't want to be like
canceled for this okay
i'm not suggesting mental illness
doesn't exist merely that in any post
whenever anybody has any
like piece of bad behavior it's just the
timer until it gets uh
attributed to something that they can't
control
it's never like i don't want to do this
thing and even that's okay if i would
just talk about it it's always like
actually
not everyone has the energy to just do
it i don't know op or his situation
why not just complete the task
op
i don't know op or his situation but
anyway
sorry that's just it's just twitter
poisoning
uh
you know you make like a joke and then
somebody's like well actually maybe the
people at best buy couldn't stock the
shelves because they're depressed and
i'm like i'm not
trying to insult the people who work at
best buy i was merely making a joke
about the system's design of the online
pickup order system okay i didn't want
it didn't have to go and had direction
am i the [ __ ] for
hold on hold on we could put a slash
marker here excuse me
slash marker react court one



am i the [ __ ] for refusing to let my
wife name our daughter ever winter rain
this is an interesting
title huh because
that is a bad name
and as a result
i don't know if you could be the [ __ ]
in that situation
you have saved your
your daughter from
probably getting her name changed
legally at some point but
okay let's
my wife and i are expecting a daughter
we already have a son who is two years
old look can i say something that's over
the line
i'm gonna do it and then i'm gonna
apologize okay
you wanna name your daughter ever winter
rain
tell me you don't believe vaccines work
without telling me you don't believe
vaccines work i'm sorry
i'm sorry
twit longer i would like to say
when i suggested that if you named your
daughter ever winter rain you were an
anti-vaxxer i was merely trying to be
humorous i was not trying to insinuate
that a super cool name like that
indicates
science denialism
i was just trying to make people laugh
but i realized that maybe i crossed over
the line one slash question mark okay
okay
so my wife and i are expecting a
daughter we already have a son who's two
years old our agreement was that i got
to name the first baby and she got to
name the second baby
i look
this is not jermaine to the post uh i'm
sure that seems like a really stupid
way to
break up that
duty i think you both should agree on
all of the names
and if you can't agree
you should just keep looking honestly
until you find one that you both find
amenable cause
that seems like a recipe for
for
this exact situation
um i went with what i thought was a
strong somewhat unique name but that
could just as easily suit a musician as
a lawyer or a doctor
i picked the name calvin heath
the middle name after my brother who
unfortunately passed away and my wife
was fine with it
look this is all fine okay
it's a little country club but also who
cares
what's in a name a a pog by any other
name would
dopamine just this sweet okay
my wife told me she wants to name our
daughter ever winter rain wherever is
the first name and winter rain is the
middle name
i don't think this is a good name and
that it isn't fair to our daughter
because ever is a word and i don't think
it passes the supreme court justice test
i don't know what that is
um it doesn't sound professional it's
confusing because it's a word and i
don't think it would suit her into
adulthood look i agree
i don't know why he's put i mean like i
i guess it's like a lifetime of
education treating us that something is
not persuasive unless it's written in
essay format but you could just be like
my wife wants to name our daughter ever
winter rain and uh i don't like it
because it sounds stupid as hell and 98
of people reading the post would be like
say no more
i suggested winter as the first name
with a more normal middle name like emma
so she has options but my wife refused
but our agreement was that she got to
pick the name am i the [ __ ] if i
refuse and don't sign the birth
certificate if she wants to name her
ever man you are [ __ ]
this is uh
a really good example of
in a mundane capacity but a really good
example of like you reap what you sow
you know you got carte blanche for the
first name
you didn't and this is your mistake you
didn't drop a nuclear bomb with it you
went with something that was
a little unique it had a little personal
touch to it but was relatively
conventional and then your wife was like
now is my time ever winter rain what you
should have done
is gone with something ridiculous to
start with like you should have been
like poop emoji
is the name of my son
at which point you would have dissolved
this ridiculous agreement
um because it just is very foolish to
just give one person complete control
over the name because this exact
situation could happen
um
so now you're in a weird spot right
which is this is like a classic scam
technique by the way you have already
collected a reward your reward was
naming your son
without your wife being able to veto it
at all
now you're forced to argue from a
position of having already accepted that
reward
and maintaining the cognitive dissonance
of like well you don't you look
we don't i know that i got 100
permission to name my child or the first
child but you don't get that same
permission i'm not saying he's an
[ __ ] because
every winter rain is a name that i find
disagreeable because of the fact that
it's
i'm gonna stop short of saying
stupid
because it's like
you know
it's cultural i guess like if the if it
has a meaning to you that's fine and
they can always change it when they're
18 to begin with hey
for stark thanks for the gifted
subscriptions much appreciated
um but i i think he's doing a noble
thing i think he's gonna eat [ __ ] for it
and that there's something admirable
about that
to be honest with you this is why you
you can't agree in this situation
right
you can never especially i don't mean
like it i'm not suggesting that his wife
was like
here's how i'm gonna screw this guy over
i'm gonna let him him name the first
child he's normal so he's probably gonna
name the child something relatively
normal and then i get to shove through
my agenda on the second one i'm not
suggesting that's what happened
what i am suggesting is
i think if you ever get
suggested that
you know you pick the first name i'll
pick the second you got to be like you
know what let's just both collude on
both of the names and then you can you
can it's like making a coalition
government work right you're never going
to get 100 your way but they're also
never going to come down with like an
edict that makes you want to die
you're gonna end up probably with not
your favorite name but at least a name
where like whenever you introduce them
you know on like activity gym or
whatever you don't have to be like
she's named runescape
rowena
no it's
it's runescape
r-u-n-e-s-c-a-p-e
runescape
not the ass i'm and by the way this is
like this pose is engineered to
have as close to complete consensus as
possible
um
at the risk of sounding like a
caricature
it is a man having a dispute with his
wife which is already probably like a
plus five percent chance to not be the
[ __ ] on reddit and then also
uh it's
one of the things on the internet that
people feel most strongly about which is
like
isn't it weird how people get named dumb
[ __ ]
it's like it's like a hundred percent
i'm surprised it isn't higher
i i gotta read some controversial
comments on this one
gonna go with not the [ __ ] because
your wife sucks at naming things
that name is
dignifiedly hot trash
hundred percent they say this with
respect
hundred percent millennial energy
this this post was written by somebody
who was born between 1984 and 1992 with
a hundred percent authority this is just
a phrase that
it's it's like a a
it's a seed phrase to tell me you're a
millennial
everybody sucks here why in the world
would you make such an arrangement you
could have built in a veto clause okay
it's tort law now or made certain
minimum requirements you didn't you're
an [ __ ] for wanting to go back on the
arrangement now that it doesn't suit you
but who thinks of such a ridiculous name
does she want the kid to have to explain
and spell her name every single time
there's some fairness not the [ __ ]
my mother named me shad i get two
reactions your name is shade shed [ __ ]
or it's shad like the fish life is hard
enough without having a stupid freaking
name
and then you
but you've owned it for your account
here
look at that
okay i'm gonna i'm not actually gonna
refuse to sign the birth certificate but
i'm gonna try to sell her on the name
everly winter rain instead bro that's
still
[ __ ] horrible
that's the rare in this case you might
as well not even go with the compromise
because
you're gonna hurt feelings and not
create a situation that's any better
please
either fight harder or give up
our agreement was i got to name the
first baby and she got to name the
second baby this is up there with me 20
and my partner 38 as one of those
openings that instantly makes me
facepalm oh man
[Laughter]
i'm glad other people saw it yank's not
trying to be rude but her taste in names
is middle school fan fiction levels of
cringe yes
any of the separately are okay winter's
rain reminds me of summer's eve
i don't understand i'm missing a joke
there somewhere
not the [ __ ] your wife wants your
daughter to be a young adult book
protagonist not the
[ __ ] not the [ __ ] yeah i agree
oh no i'm like i'm waiting for the story
that's like
forward forward re re my friend's
sister's cousin's friend works as a
first grade teacher and there was a
student whose name was l a hyphen a
and i said la ah
and then they said actually it's ladasha
source this is really true i promise for
real actually true happens
it's it's happened to everybody's friend
of a friend of a friend over the course
of the last 30 years um
i work at an elementary school and see
all kinds of weird names we had a whole
family of children named after movie
swords blade excalibur
okay ever is fine
i think it's a bit weird myself it's
fine i think it's a bit weird name
should be a joy decision imo but you
chose your path and now she's choosing
the name you're the [ __ ] i just gotta
like i understand where you're coming at
this from okay
but like
i think this is one where as the husband
you gotta recognize that you're breaking
the terms of the arrangement but this is
like a forced major
clause i i putting myself in their shoes
i think i would be content to let my
wife choose the name but then if she
chose something
truly outrageous i'd be like i'm sorry
but i have to be the [ __ ] now this is
an act of god
i i have to do right by my unborn child
by not letting you burden them with this
name
even if it means i'm going back on the
terms of our agreement
not the [ __ ] i think you're the
[ __ ]
i went to a high school with a boy named
ever and never thought twice about it
and he wasn't bullied for it it's not a
super common name but it is an unheard
of mila jovovich named her daughter ever
gabo
hey hey hey excuse me
hey

daughter she's an actress daughter
alanis morissette has a son
named ever
popular mormon mommy blogger
c jane courtney kendrick has a daughter
named ever has there ever been
a sentence more designed to make the
source untrustworthy then
popular mormon mommy blogger c jane
courtney kendrick has a daughter named
ever
that's like saying hey oj simpson named
the horse ever
like that's it's
you mila jovovich okay

robert carradine kind of 30 years ago
elena's morris said all right
popular mormon mommy blogger c jane i

courtney kendricks is okay according
kendrick but anytime you hear the
expression popular mormon mommy blogger
cjane
you don't expect that there's going to
be something positive after it's going
to be like popular mormon mommy blogger
see jane incarcerated tonight after it
finds out she was feeding her kids
exclusively chunky peanut butter for the
last 10 years over to you

calling her daughter in from the park if
yelling out loud ever ever

parents then it's gonna sound stupid in
front of real ones
i i gotta understand i prefer the park
test to the supreme court test phantom
and oh jesus christ

runescape runescape
i the [ __ ] for getting angry at my
sister who said she had no money to buy
a gift for our mom's birthday but then
took her girlfriend to dinner at an
expensive restaurant
i don't know this is the rare title that
i don't have an answer right right out
of the gate
normally it's it's clear as day but
let's see
my mother celebrated her birthday last
weekend jermaine question how old is she
you're 26 your sister's 23
if your mom is turning 50
your sister might be the [ __ ]
if your mom is turning 52
i'm not gonna you should do something
nice i'm just saying
they're not all not all birthdays
require
such a an extravagant gift you know
when you're 52 you could
take her out for dinner
get her a nice card take her out for
dinner spend time with her that's
probably what she wants when she's 50
you should get her i don't know probably
like maybe a range rover
my mother celebrated her birthday last
weekend two weeks before i-26f asked my
sister 23f what gift we were gonna buy
for our mom she said she's sorry but
money was tight she didn't have any
money to pitch in for a gift i know my
sister doesn't earn as much as i do so i
told her that was fine i was thinking of
buying our mom a 500 necklace and i
could shoulder the full price of the
gift her contribution
excuse me her contribution could be that
she could choose
she would be the one to buy it from the
jewelry store that's the greatest deal
of all time
you pay for it i get to go to the store
and buy it
this is the worst trade deal in the
history of deals
i would where do i sign up for that
i transferred the money to her and she
bought it i put my and my sister's name
on the front portion and we had a nice
birthday dinner all right let's just say
right off the bat
good sister that's a good sister action
um today i saw in my social media feed
that my sister's girlfriend posted a
picture of the two of them having dinner
at a popular expensive restaurant where
a meal for two would be upwards of 200
bucks my sister's girlfriend's caption
was thanking my sister for the best
anniversary dinner this is a spicy one
and this is this is my bread and butter
okay
what takes precedent
the holiday significance hierarchy
your mother's birthday
or your anniversary with your
significant other
that's a tough one
i would here's the thing
which anniversary is it
and which of your mom's birthday
is it
if it's
your first anniversary
and your mom's
70th birthday
you go with the birthday
if it's your first anniversary it's your
mom's 53rd birthday you go anniversary
all right because
look you're you're you're close with
your parents
i mean you don't have to i just mean on
the family tree like in turn the median
the median person is close with their
parents but you build like a
a unique bubble around the relationship
you have with your romantic partner
they're both important but the
you the holidays you celebrate
with your significant other i think take
precedent personally
but it's a tough question
mom helped raise your girlfriend can get
the smoke
yes but but
your mom raised you but her mom raised
her so is that's the the quintessential
philosophy about the parent-child
relationship
as a parent are you paying forward
the raising that you got from your mom
to your child
or as a child are you responsible when
you get older to pay back
the love and affection that was given to
you as a child from your parent
the way that our family is like
at least on my side the way that it's
kind of set up is my mom
raised me with love and care
and never wants anything from me except
for my time
she wants to shower that attention onto
my my own child
and just continually like pass the
dopamine down the chain
there are some families where it goes in
the opposite direction i think where the
parent
the parents raise you and then when you
get to be a certain age they're like
please give us
money now because we
raised you financially which caused us
great cost and now
you know you need to support us i think
it's just the cultural thing honestly
and and then also my parents were just
like really nice about it to begin with
but
child stonks
anyway sorry we've gone too far but i
think that
i think you have a
at a certain age and with a certain
relationship i think you have a closer
relationship with your spouse than your
parents i mean you spend like well it's
not a spouse but you spend more time
with your romantic partner than you do
with your parents by like a factor of 50
maybe maybe more honestly
anyway sorry i got lost in the weeds
[Laughter]
i got upset and called my sister and
asked her why she told me that she
didn't have money for a gift from my mom
but she apparently had money to have
dinner with her girlfriend in an
expensive restaurant she got defensive
and said that i was okay paying for my
mom's gift all by myself so i was angry
that she and her girlfriend had an
expensive dinner i told her that it was
not about them having an expensive
dinner but about the fact that she lied
about not having money and wasn't
willing to spend literally not a single
dollar for a gift from my mom while she
was spending hundreds of dollars for a
dinner for her girlfriend look okay this
is why every argument needs somebody
like a an argument
arbitrator
that can stand in the argument and be
like that's not fair because this
she lied about not having money whatever
one second she wasn't willing to spend
anything not literally a single
dollar as the argument arbitrator
did you ask her if she would feel
comfortable spending a single dollar or
did you not even ask her for a dollar
because that would be so patronizing uh
to be like hey how about i pay 4.99 and
you pay one and then we'll both write
our names on it
i don't think that you
i don't think you have the right to
offer that i'm gonna pay for the whole
thing and then be like you didn't even
pay for point two percent of it
anyway
i'm not saying op's wrong by the way
my sister said she didn't lie to me she
had no money for mom's gifts because she
already allocated the money to the
dinner with her girlfriend and she
doesn't even know why she has to explain
herself because i have no right
to tell her how to spend her money this
is going to be one of this is going to
be the flashpoint issue for this episode
because as of right now i don't have a
problem with the sister in this
situation this is going to be the one
that's going to lower the like dislike
ratio to like you know 92 percent
instead of 98.
my point is that she did have money she
could have given me 20 and had dinner
with her girlfriend but she didn't want
to spend anything for the woman who gave
birth to and raised us
am i the [ __ ] okay okay okay okay
okay edit edit edit we all went in the
heat of the moment we all said some
things that we disagree with now with
cooler heads added just to clear it up
because it's a recurring
misunderstanding in the comments not due
to the way i wrote it but just
independently thousands of people
misreading it in the exact same way i
did not ask my sister to shoulder half
the cost of the necklace she told me she
didn't have money to pitch in for a gift
before i told her what i was planning to
get for our mom for those asking we
always do joint gifts to make it more
special a gift from both daughters
instead of just one in the past i have
always paid more because i earned more i
just asked my sister what she can afford
to pitch in and take it this is the
first year she said she doesn't have any
money to pitch in okay
let's start with the obvious preamble
almost every am i the [ __ ] can just
be
solved or at least
ameliorated a little bit by having a
conversation with the person instead of
going to reddit first but i get that
this is also like a vent
i would also like to say that
when you get the chance to display your
argument your side your emotions and
your feelings you have a huge advantage
in the court of public perception it
takes a lot
most disagreements i think
that come up on these subreddits are
like a 45-55 you know
person a has
a reason to have acted maybe in the
asshole-ish way that they did and then
person b has the right to be upset about
it it's less like you know hey they shot
my
pet
am i the [ __ ] for crying you know
there's some of that
me 18 my boyfriend 55 etc etc but most
of them are like you know somewhere in
the you can understand both sides and
then you just pick one that you agree
with right um
this one
i i gotta say
i feel like sister
not the [ __ ] let me lay out my case
okay
from the series of events or the
sequence as outlayed by op it seems like
op's sister said i don't have any money
to contribute and then
op decided
i have the means to buy an expensive
gift i'm happy to do it we'll put both
our names on it
if
op
one
let me rephrase if the sister had been
like i can only contribute twenty
dollars
would op have still gotten a 500
necklace or would she have maybe gotten
something that was like
200 bucks or 150 bucks or something like
that and then just had you know the
sister contribute whatever she could the
way i see this is that
op doesn't have the right to be upset
that the necklace was expensive and that
the sister didn't help
in spite of the fact that she picked the
gift in the first place
i'm not sure if i phrased that properly
if they had colluded
on a gift that would have made the
sister more comfortable with maybe
throwing in 10 bucks 20 bucks something
like that
i feel like my hunch is that op would
have been like we can't get our mom
a 50 gift we gotta at least up it a
little bit so i don't feel like you have
the right to choose an expensive gift
and then be mad that your sister
independently
spend money on an important event to be
honest but i i don't think you have the
the the right to be mad that the gift
you chose was expensive and the other
person spent a commensurate amount of
money that could have helped with a gift
on something else she didn't say hey i
don't have money please buy a 500 gift
she just said i can't really contribute
and then you chose a 500 gift
that's my take on the subject
she wasn't mad about the amount she's
mad about the lying
i disagree on whether this is lying you
know
if uh
i mean i i hate to say it
let's let's come up with a situation
let's say i have
100
650 dollars in my savings account okay
uh
but
i know that as soon as walmart releases
playstation fives
in eight days
i'm gonna spend almost all that money on
a playstation 5. if someone asked me do
you have the money to pitch in on this
do i say yes i have the money to pitch
in or do i say no because the money
that's in my savings account is already
spoken for
whether or not you believe that a
playstation 5 is more important than
your mom's birthday gift you say no
right
a playstation 5 is not comparable it's
actually not comparable because the
playstation 5 at least has some use
whereas a 500 necklace is suspend
essentially just giving like you know
some profit to the people's diamond
corporation uh because you're like i
don't know too embarrassed to just tell
your mom like thank you for raising me i
love you you're like one of the most
important people in my life instead
you're willing to pay like a tax to the
people's jewelry corporation so that
the gesture can say it for you at least
a ps5 you know it can play demon souls
remake
the necklace is is completely useless
i would also say money is tight by the
way
i'm not going to judge how the sister is
spending her money
but if she can only afford
either her mom's birthday gift or this
dinner then money's tight that's not a
lie
if if
throwing like if if having an expensive
special
dinner causes you to have to adjust
you know fi your financial obligations
and other aspects of your life money
that's that's the definition of tight
you gotta move stuff around
whether or not she should you know
spend her money if she has a limited
amount she should be should she be
spending so much of it on like one
dinner that's a personal decision that's
not for me to judge necessarily i don't
really want to be uh on record here on
my stream being like hey poor people
should never have nice things even for
special events if you want to type that
in chat and be like actually she should
have bought like you know seven
kilograms of black beans and a bag of
rice instead then by all means
you know i'm just saying
she she basically had to make a choice
is she going to
buy her mom an expensive
or contribute to her mom's expensive
birthday gift that was chosen by
somebody who is not in his financially
tight situation as she is or
alternatively spend that money on you
know
getting her
you know strengthening and celebrating
her relationship with her significant
other i would
i would say it's the sisters business
honestly but i do also acknowledge
like
i'm
in the minority here a little bit and i
think it's a tight issue like i can see
why people would be on both sides
i do agree with the people in chat by
the way who are saying like my mom
wouldn't want me to buy her something
like that i i'm in the same boat like
if we bought we
if we take my mom out for like
if we go to like cactus club which is i
don't know how to describe it like one
step up from like an applebee's she's
like oh my god you guys please let me
pay for this and i'm like mom just shut
up
we're picking up the check you didn't
have to get eight bellini's but like
we'll still pick up the check don't
worry about it okay
just relax
but i do also recognize
like sometimes we'll buy kate's mom a
nice thing
and she'll be like
thank you so much also what you couldn't
splurge for like one size higher
[Laughter]
so you don't you don't get to choose who
your family is maybe the mom maybe that
kind of stuff is important to uh
to her mom but anyway
i don't know i'm interested to see the
comments here though
let's see
not the [ __ ] from now on just get
your mama gift herself if your sister
can't afford to that's on her
that's totally true by the way like i
don't disagree with that
if you want to just get her a gift and
be like this is from me
and then you know vanessa can handle her
own gift that's totally fine
that seems like a great solution not the
[ __ ] just by giving separately from
now on i didn't even consider that man
that's that's only child brain right
there i didn't even consider that you
could just split the gifts
save you a lot of grief
not the [ __ ]
there's a difference between being able
to afford something and whether or not
you literally have the money you asked
her only two weeks in advance she'd
already made the plans wait okay so
who's so who's the [ __ ]
i don't i
not oh not the [ __ ] no [ __ ] here
okay yeah i would agree with that
and by the way uh based and egg pilled
most people don't buy 500 gifts had you
suggested splitting a 60 gift maybe she
could have found the money to do that in
the future just buy your own gifts yeah
absolutely and then of course
only two weeks it's not a surprise their
mother's birthday has been the same for
their entire lives
if the sister can remember to put money
aside for her anniversary after a couple
years she should be able to remember to
put money in aside for an event she's
been celebrating for decades
any i hate i hate this formatting
again millennial energy i think
whatever happened to bold man now we're
all using caps
hold on if you'll excuse me
your sister is an adult she's allowed to
spend her money however she wants she
should be allowed to go in on an
anniversary dinner with her girlfriend
it makes some sense she'd prioritize it
on an anniversary dinner over a 500
necklace for her mom
i agree so far you seem weirdly
controlling about your sister's life
well you were the one who chose such an
expensive gift offered to pay for it all
put her name on it you could have just
made it your gift and left her out of it
this just seems like cr you creating
petty drama you're the [ __ ]
yeah
kind of again this is all like
how you read it without them having had
a conversation
i mean again like it just a it's a
difference of opinion right like
we always get her joint gifts i thought
it would be more special for my mom a
gift from both of her daughters instead
of just from one i earned more than my
sister so i'd always pay more i would
just ask her what she can afford to
pitch in and take it this is the first
year she said she doesn't have anything
i was okay with that because i really
thought money was tight for her i'm like
just because she spent 200 bucks on a
dinner doesn't mean money is not tight
right like i mean it would be a
different story if you were like
hey like we need you to contribute to
mom's medical bills
and she was like oh i can't i have this
anniversary dinner that i'm spending 200
on but you're like these are two
forgive my phrasing here okay these are
two frivolous expenses
the sister has the right to choose which
one
is more important to her if
it's not like one of them is more valid
and necessary and then the other one is
like a complete luxury like they're
they're both
discretionary expenses
i just don't understand uh
why it's like she lied about being
broke it's like you can still be
you can spend 200 on a dinner and still
be broke you could like buy something
nice for a gift and still be broke if
anything you're more broke because
you've done it
this is not like uh
it's not like
you're policing like have you suffered
enough to be able to spend this
tight but you're not wearing a barrel
with suspender straps on it that's what
i'm exactly
[Laughter]
like none of
at no point in the article is it like my
sister is destitute and derelict uh
and yet she's going out for a 200 dinner
while like you know sucking on the teeth
of the taxpayer or whatever it's just
like she doesn't have enough money to
contribute to a gift but she also bought
a nice dinner that doesn't make her a
hypocrite
just you know she went she went out for
a nice dinner
why are you wearing a windbreaker inside
because i am a windbreaker inside
based
not the [ __ ] but this is a big but
you need to realize people budget what
they prioritize i prioritize food and
rent not everyone does
it's always
people who don't spend money
always think that they have the moral
high grounds you don't know that your
sister is not also prioritizing food on
the table in rent
your mom's birthday gift is not food on
the table or rent it's that's another
discretionary expense
i'm not saying it's not important i'm
just saying you don't get to be like
well you and i have reasonable budgets
because we're smart people but there's
some dummies out there that buy you know
they spend money on different things
that are frivolous
some people will always have money for
alcohol or cigarettes regardless you
always have money for what and who is
important to you your mom was not in
your per mom was not important her
girlfriend was the end
man that's crazy
i kind of like envy
um
the viewpoint of people who
just see things so cut and dry as this
so clearly
there's been a lot of times like if you
distilled it down to his brass tacks in
my early 20s
i don't think i ever got my mom a
birthday gift that was more than just
like a card and a phone call
and i definitely spent money on dumb
[ __ ]
and i'm very thankful that i was not
judged as like oh so like in september
uh you know
you had 20 beers out with your friends
over the course of the whole month and
yet you didn't get you could have bought
me a 42 gift with that amount of money
or something like that like my mom is
more important to me but at the same
time like
i mean it's just like a weird confluence
of things like you always have money for
what and who is important to you
i guess i just see it differently that
like
you know you can show your appreciation
to the people in your life
uh without
needing to quantify it with like a
financial ledger item
like i i've never gotten like a birthday
card from someone and then been like oh
i guess i'm not important enough for you
to shove 20 bucks in the card i'm always
like you know
thanks uncle greg i appreciate the card
thanks for thinking of me
we haven't spoken in like 11 years and
you still have my birthday in your
calendar that's kind of sick like
i guess i guess you're just like a bad
child
if you uh spend money on your girlfriend
but not on your mom
you know what maybe your mom should have
bought like
into the s p 500 in the 90s when she was
uh earning and it's gone like 7x from
then and then she could buy like her own
gifts uh
you know how do you feel about that mom
you grow you grew up in an economic
golden age
and yet you're out here asking me to
throw you
stop having anniversary dinners you pay
for a 500 necklace come on
all right we got like i think we got one
more in us
if your workflows still consist of long
email threads and casual conversations
in the hallway you need monday.com the
smart way
to manage your team monday.com gives you
the visibility you need to monitor all
ongoing projects in real time so you're
always in control
tell me your trello without telling me
you're trello
um
we already did the only fans one that
was like a month ago
would i be the [ __ ] if i don't tell
my best friend's dying mother that my
son is actually her grandson
i'm not touching that one with a 10-foot
pole
am i the [ __ ] for grounding my
daughter for using an evil spell on her
deceased mother
it's so what is happening i i don't know
any of these man
am i the [ __ ] for choosing a friend
wedding over my sister's segregated one
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to move
out because my polyamorous boyfriend's
wife doesn't want another dog am i the
[ __ ] for refusing to move
because my polyamorous boyfriend's wife
doesn't want another dog
i don't even i'm not judging the
lifestyle i'm just trying to
keep
the nouns in my head to figure out how
these people are connected to one
another
am i the [ __ ] this is a person person
a
i won't move because my boyfriend
person b
his
wife person c doesn't want another dog
how does this happen
cause she has a dog
and she's gonna move in
but they want her to move out with the
dog okay i'm not i'm not touching this
with a 10-foot pole okay delete it
i don't want to be seen as judging this
because like i genuinely don't care
basically at all what people do with
their personal lives um
the only thing this makes me think is
like that's really complicated like it's
just
it's the same thing when i was like
watching the the tiger woods documentary
and it was like he has
14 mistresses
i wasn't like i mean there was a part of
me that's like wow that's like a scumbag
move but there was another part of me
that's like
man you got to be like tired as hell
tiger
that's a lot of work man
i keep like
six people in my life
in contact it's like my mom my dad
my wife my daughter and then like the
discord group
that i talked to that's it and even then
sometimes i'm like ah i'm too tired to
like you know check in with my mom today
tiger woods was like winning
every single grand sl well they're not
grand slams right what are the majors
he's winning
you know 2.78 majors a year married with
three kids millions of dollars in
endorsements he's got 14 mistresses as
well
don't you ever just want to like sit on
the on the on the couch and just take
like a nap or something that's crazy
um like did is it gone the post is
deleted
all right
is it does it get archived no no no okay
i i had to know
um i gotta know man this is the one
cause this is like ridden by an angry
dad am i the [ __ ] for trying to teach
my future step children a little
discipline like the less specific that
you get in the headline
the more you've abstracted it back
in order to make it seem like this is
where ev when an argument gets to the
point you're where you're like oh i
guess i'm the [ __ ] for wanting people
to be happy that's wha you're like so
far back from the thing that originally
caused the argument to begin with that
you've already lost
let's see
me
i'm 46 engaged to 41 she has two kids 15
11 from a previous marriage she raised
them largely on her own and they're
great kids i love them as my own
however she has most definitely spoiled
the hell out of them gives them
everything they want and as i've been
slowly finding out in the last few years
she's basically done everything for them
their entire lives they've never been
given the slightest bit of
responsibility they're both very lazy
but they constantly have their hands out
looking for someone to give them
something this is not gonna be popular
with chat right now but like
yeah i hope this is uh 11
male not 11 months old
[Laughter]
because if they're 11 months old you
should give them whatever they ask for
because speaking as the parent of an 11
month old it's just a lot of
you know food and affection basically um
i could understand
having a 15 year old step daughter and
being like we need to start teaching her
some responsibility maybe it's a boom or
take but i think part of the role of a
parent especially as they're in that
period where they're transitioning from
child to adult is to spoon feed them an
opportunity to
gain responsibility because the older
you get the the more responsibility you
have to take on to begin with
i was raised very differently not in a
strict household but a single-parent
household with mom my siblings and i
were taught very early about
responsibility and basic life lessons we
did without which made us appreciate
what we had i had been slowly trying to
burn it into their brains that they are
not babies
gentle
i was raised in this situation i've been
trying to sear it into their cerebral
cortex that they're not babies
uh and that they need to pick up around
the house without having to be
constantly told to do so if you want
something earn it by doing chores my
fiance gives me a ton of blowbacks she
doesn't see why i get so upset when they
won't get off their asses i'm trying to
teach them self-sufficiency she tells me
i'm being an [ __ ] and i'm being too
hard on them this guy's identity is
wrapped up in never asking for help
which is
okay that doesn't make him a bad person
necessarily
but it it it's like he knows that you
have to phrase
it in a gentle way like i want to
introduce them to responsibility so they
don't grow up to be completely helpless
but then the language he uses to talk
about it makes it sound like whenever he
sees like a cup on the island he's like
where the frick did this cup come from
you know you didn't need to
uh
you guys are so lazy i'm trying to teach
you how to be self-sufficient like it's
just a little
there's a
there's a culture difference here
you know there's like the the way that
he talks versus the way that he sees
himself he sees himself as like a
chivalric knight but he talks like his
profile photo on twitter is him in his
truck wearing sunglasses let me clarify
a bit by the way
what say you am i the [ __ ]
we talked about these things before
moving in together yes it was agreed
we'd both work together with regard to
how we'd handle the kids i asked her
point blank
if she would be okay with me imposing a
little bit more of a direct approach to
letting them know they'd have to pitch
in around the house she was 100 on board
also she said she expected me to act as
her equal as far as parenting went that
was her idea not mine i told her from
the very beginning i would never ever
intentionally overstep her boundaries
i'm not a hard ass i'm actually very
laid back but when i'm asked to parent
these kids and i see them being lazy
unmotivated and okay look look look look
look look look
the 15 year old
okay
you got to take a different approach
with the teenager
than the 11 year old though he's an 11
year old being lazy unmotivated
disrespectful i won't speak to but
lazy
they're 11.
they're like they're in like fifth grade
that's you don't have to impose that
kind of culture in them at that age i
mean like you get them a couple of
breadcrumbs to get along the road but
lack of specific examples here is
troublesome i would agree with that as
well like there's no we we're being
asked to exclusively look at this one in
a vacuum which i i don't respect
give me a specific situation well let me
i didn't mean to yell at them but i had
a really hard day at work uh i was so
annoyed when i came home i stubbed my
toe on a skateboard and then i just went
off i completely lost control but it's
not my fault because the 11 year old kid
doesn't have a job yet so um
it sounded good to her in theory but now
she's balking at it and i feel like i'm
trapped in a minefield not sure which
way to step without risking an explosion
yes that is indeed that's the metaphor
you and look now i'm just being i'm
being the [ __ ]
but when you make a metaphor
you're making the metaphor as a
substitution for spelling out
the exact thing that you mean
you don't need to be like
i feel like i'm stuck between a rock and
a hard place now like i can't move
because i've got two things that are
pressing in on me making it impossible
you know it's uh that that's the what
the purpose of the metaphor is but
anyway
i love them as my own nothing in your
post even indicates you even like these
children that come on
that's too far you don't know that
he could be a great stepfather
this is just too much man
anyway
sorry
you're the [ __ ] you're not the parent
here their actual parent is telling you
this is not a big deal
did you see ops update
did i see ops update
i don't think i did you got to go to qa
for that
you're the [ __ ] oh oh no oh no
downvoted op
old-fashioned childhood learning basic
life stuff like simple responsibility is
old-fashioned good luck with that
mindset minus 51.
sort by
q a
i don't know how to use reddit
if i didn't like them would i be here
asking for opinions from total strangers
in an effort to remedy the situation
yeah swinging a miss on your part oh no
they're a facebook user
how upset are you getting i don't scream
and yell or put my hands on them if
that's what you're asking
nope
that's pretty much like the bare minimum
i am not looking for validation also i
don't think i've been combative at all
shy of giving a bit of snark back to
those who gave it to me first you do
know that there's such a thing as tough
love right
there's no easy way to step into this
situation as anyone who has ever tried
will attest calling them a spoiled
doesn't mean i don't love them they
freely admit they're spoiled they know
it they own up to it but thanks for the
input
i appreciate it oh
oh no
look at the downvotes man this is crazy
it's i and i think it's deserved
why is this guy so allergic to answering
questions right
have you ever worked with children
before this is a genuine question yes
so
wow very believable
i've worked with kids so often i can't
even write any specifics out because
like
if there's just so many my keyboard
would break by the time i finished yeah
no yeah for sure
more please more you are not a parent oh
no what have i done no
oh my god they're still po they're
posting on other stuff now
they took that as a great opportunity to
launch their account
nice piece of wax
[Laughter]
vinyl releases
nice piece of wax anyway
he posts there of course that i didn't
mean to click on it i know it could have
been nsfw
anyway i think he's kind of the [ __ ]
in this situation
either way um we're gonna move on this
was a fun react chord though slash
marker
the
end of react
chord



you're the [ __ ] tell me more
all right nobody's gonna get a photo huh
well i mean i look i have to put myself
i i have to take a stand
i will
the stand i'm taking is i need to know
what the house was like because
genuinely i'm like
it
i'm i'm let me just put it this way i'm
stunned to the number of people in chat
who are like no matter what it's not the
[ __ ] if you held your house to a
reasonable standard of cleanliness
and then somebody came over and instead
of sleeping which is like what you want
to do um she spent seven hours cleaning
your house essentially sending you the
message that you're like uh a total slob
um
you wouldn't be upset if you're like
what if you had spent time cleaning it
but like before she came over on top of
that i would be upset
the flip side is
if i saw a photo and there was and it
looked like a
like a [ __ ] disgusting like dorm i
would be like i i don't think she's the
[ __ ]
i think her her boyfriend should grow up
and you know
either accept
the bachelor life wholeheartedly and
hang out with the guy who drinks three
quarters of a pink whitney every night
or alternatively like if you want to
have people over to your house you got
to make it like safe and comfortable for
them to be there
that's i mean i that's where i'm at he's
like 33 yeah but his house could have
been clean the wrinkle in this is that
uh
like she's
many standard deviations of caring about
cleanliness off from the average person
right i have a hard time falling asleep
if there's even one dish in the sink
i feel unclean
my mom instilled how important it is to
me to have my house clean would get me
to redo chores five or ten times in a
row i was never allowed to go to bed if
the house was messy like that's the kind
of thing where i can foresee because
there's no damn photo there's no
evidence which is suspicious in and of
itself
but
i can foresee a situation where she came
over and the house was actually kind of
normal but she was like there's two
dishes in the sink i literally can't
sleep whether or not that dude's a
little funky for dating someone 11 years
younger than him look that's
personal opinion
i agree with you and honestly just
sounds exhausting as someone who deals
with you know i'm 32 and i deal with 25
year olds in chat all day i can't even
imagine being around a 22 year old for
like more than 12 hours in a single
sitting but much less like you know
having them over at my house i'm just
saying like
personally this is uh i i can see
i can foresee a situation
where
he thought the place was tidy and kind
of got blindsided it took hours to clean
yeah but anything can take hours to
clean if your standards for cleanliness
or that has got a sparkle right
house cleaning is a it's an elastic task
you can you can stretch it or compress
it as necessary
anyway
yeah
it sounds like she should um
get a job as like a a house cleaner it
seems like she's very thorough
bad take
bad take through and through tell me uh
you don't have uh any points to back up
your argument
instead you're just just trying to
thought police bad take
anybody else think this is a bad take or
just me boomer take boom or take anybody
else crawling like a viper through these
suburban streets or just me
bad take why you should know okay cool
yeah all right
take a photo of your floor right now
send it over
is it a bad take because you've got a
floor littered with filet of fish
wrappers and you just want someone to
clean it up for you
i'm just asking just asking for a friend
like two people can play the ad hominem
game okay and i gotta tell you i
probably got more experience hosted the
nlss for like a decade
am i now here we go let's let's get
let's let's annoy the half of chad that
agreed with me and get on the side of
the half of chat that thought it was a
bad take with this one am i the [ __ ]
for asking my wife for a day of solitude
when i have an anxiety day about twice a
month
hard to tell just from the title but i'm
just gonna say i don't think that's
gonna go over that well
i i look just asking for it means you're
braver than i am but let's let's see
i work full-time and my wife stays at
home with our child okay you are [ __ ]
dude
i don't even need to read the rest
whether you're right or wrong you can't
escape this with your life
um
work is incredibly stressful because of
our short staffed we are i've been
putting in a lot more overtime i get off
maybe one day a week about once or twice
a month i go into a depressive funk it's
always on a day off i don't know if it's
just my body crashing from all the work
or what i'll wake up and immediately
feel emotionally and physically terrible
there's no way to destress i can try
doing hobbies like playing video games
but they end up feeling like chores and
stress me out i feel my body physically
shaking and the moment somebody says
something to me i want to go off of them
the only way to get through the day is
just to go to bed and be by myself count
it as a wasted day and then try again
tomorrow all right that like
definitely [ __ ] sucks
no doubt and i'm not saying this person
is the [ __ ] especially not based on
like the first paragraph
um
that being said you also had to pull
yourself in your wife's shoes that like
six days a week she's on full-time baby
duty and the one day
maybe weekly that she's gonna get off to
uh
you know do anything that isn't just
singing the same
10 songs over and over and over again
um
you know
well i don't know how to phrase it
[Laughter]
well all i'll say is it sucks for
the wife in this situation who is like
um
you know
on on the one day where i might okay
that's true i don't know as a baby i'm
i'm i'm i'm projecting i guess but
like
like it's still well i mean
i will relieve her of baby duty yeah
okay frick you that's why because i read
ahead
when i'm not in a funk i will help her
out at home i'll relieve her of baby
duty and do chores but days i am in the
funk i can't do anything for fear of
lashing out i told my wife i'll let her
know when i'm having anxiety that day
and it's nothing she did but i just need
to be left alone to sleep it off she
gets upset either way i know it's not
fair to her because she doesn't get a
day off i'm just afraid i'll screw
something up because i'm not in a good
head space i thought about going to a
doctor but nothing's covered by my
insurance so i would have to pay
hundreds that we don't have so what do
you think wow um okay so not that well
okay
you're the [ __ ] but for like good
reason
i don't know if we've had many of those
in the well we've had some but i don't
know how many of those we've had in the
past
it's like i in in the the the
microcosmic situation between you and
your wife
you
are asking her something unfair but
you're doing it for a reason that makes
a lot of sense which is you're suffering
from
bad mental health and feeling like you
don't have the means to fix that so yeah
i don't have a great funny answer for
this um
that that sucks
basically um let's let's see what people
in the comments are saying i'm sure that
it'll be uh
reasonable
you're the [ __ ]
you are a parent now get therapy take a
few minutes to clear your head listen
okay i know
we're
amazing worldwide depression rates fall
to zero that's what i was worried about
is that i would be like you know
hey that sucks for you bro you know i'm
a parent i have hard days too but you
know i just suck it up because i guess
like i'm different um
i look i
in principle i don't necessarily
disagree i don't think that's how it
works though i want to be sympathetic
but you're the [ __ ] it's weird that
your funk days are always on your days
off and since you won't get help i don't
see why your wife shouldn't be upset she
has to deal with house chores your kid
she gets to worry about her husband's
well-being that sounds like an awesome
day for her man they are
they're lighting this guy up in the
comments man
they are
find a new job made if your book is so
no it's
they're they're going ready for the
jugular
so your days off when you could be
helping out with your baby at home you
could be giving your wife a free day are
the days you're magically just in a funk
and want to free pass the runoff and do
your own thing
uh
the only way to get through the days is
just go to bed and be by myself count it
as a wasted day and try again tomorrow
anyway the thing is like i agree
in principle like i can see it from the
wife's standpoint like that
sucks
uh it just also sucks for the husband i
think this is one where like if you're
making a comment that's like this is so
easy then you're kind of the [ __ ]
because uh
you know this is not like a black and
white situation
this is just
i mean it just blows
yeah anyway
basically i don't know like
what what kind of i'm not the i'm not
the person with all the answers right
i do think
you know as somebody who is like
completely ignorant about mental health
i do think that
you have a responsibility especially
when you have a child to to find a
healthier way of coping with it
um
but
i also
have the luxury of of being in a
position where like
you know the cost of mental and it's not
covered by the way in canada like
much like dental care people assume that
like mental health care is covered up
here but really it's just you know
necessary medical care is like is
covered up here um or if you get like
you know i think if you get
oh if you wait two years it's covered
okay um
i did not know that to be honest but um
i i think if you
you you get a lot of
you get more leeway
after recognizing that you have
the problem when you're taking steps to
fix it i guess that's as comfortable as
i feel like going across
if that makes sense you know if if
you're spending the day in bed because
you have anxiety and then you're like
i've thought about trying to fix it but
can't
people are gonna be in the comments on
you like that's not an option if you're
taking steps actively to
which is easier said than done i'm sure
then i think the people in the comments
will still light you up but light you up
like a little bit less
i feel for the the wife though i mean
that's just like as a that's just a
nasty situation
that's basically
that's that's just uh that's a powder
keg all the way around
anyway well that was fun uh am i the
[ __ ] for buying my girlfriend an
exercise bike can i can i alienate
everybody
i still to this day
am not
dunking on peloton for the peloton wife
commercial and maybe i'm missing the
nuance in it okay so the peloton wife
was a
viral dunk campaign where it was like an
ad where this wife was like hey my
husband got me a peloton and then she
journaled like you know up at 4am
drinking juice on the peloton you know
and she was like
you know she did anyway she she was
working out hard on the bike and the
whole campaign
got dunked on because people were like
wow what an [ __ ] like her husband
basically got her a present that was
like lose some weight so you can be a
supermodel and my whole
like
when when i watched it i was just like
man i wish i wish someone would buy me a
peloton
this [ __ ] is expensive
you know
it would make exercising more fun
if kate got me a peloton i'm not this
i'm not dropping a hint they're very
expensive and we don't have a lot of
space but if kate got me a peloton would
there be a part of me that's like
you know
she's calling me
a little chubby i would be like yeah
she's not wrong
that's why i want the peloton in the
first place
i would
like i would welcome it i would take it
as a as a positive sign but anyway
let's let's so i i always thought the
dunk campaign was like a little too much
on the peloton but
it there is there's a gender difference
for sure
i know i get what you're saying when
you're saying you don't understand
you're a man it's because when a wife
calls her husband fat it's based right
that's what you're trying to say like
it's so much harder to be a man because
like we're constantly body shamed like
that i'm picking up on what you're
saying
i totally get it okay am i the [ __ ]
for buying my girlfriend an exercise
bike
the last three years have been rough on
my girlfriend of four years she's lost a
few family members lost a job but
luckily for a new one lots of stress in
her life she turned to comfort eating to
cope and put on a good amount of weight
nearly 100 pounds for about three weeks
she's been saying i need to lose weight
i need to work out if only i had the
stuff here so hearing that and wanting
to help her out i bought her a peloton
bike for her apartment without telling
her first wanted it to be a surprise she
took the gesture not as i intended she
took it as my boyfriend telling me i'm
too fat my intent was hey i know you're
always talking about losing weight
working out more let me help okay tell
me you're a
software engineer without telling me
you're a software engineer
unfortunately i can't investigate
because you've deleted your account
there was problem
i applied solution and you have the
audacity to be upset with me
it makes notes please debug
rubber duck debug me explain to me okay
um
i here's what i'm gonna say okay
i don't think
that this makes him i don't think he's
an [ __ ] for buying his girlfriend an
exercise bike
i do think
there is like a little bit of an [ __ ]
vibe just in like the first couple of
sentences
the last three years have been rough on
my girlfriend of four years she lost a
few family like i get that he's not
saying hey
some people died so i bought you a bike
but even still i'm like
you know lost the job luckily got a new
one she's got a lot of stress she turned
for to comfort eating to cope and put on
a good amount of weight nearly 100
pounds i don't know something about that
it's
i don't know that sentence just kind of
like weirds me out i don't know that
like i don't think
i guess i'm i'm i woke up on the
different side of the bed today i don't
think he's an [ __ ] for this
maybe i'm being the guy now who's like
she can't be mad he bought her a two
thousand dollar bike
i mean i don't know because like
i'm putting myself in
i i can't put myself in her shoes as
much as i as much as i would like to
because it would strengthen my point
right but like
this is one of those things where i i'm
really like
listen to me okay it's not it's not
actually about the issue at hand i think
like socially there is learned behavior
and one of those learned behaviors is
you don't buy your significant other
especially if they're a woman you don't
buy them exercise equipment you don't
buy them a gym membership you don't buy
them you know an exercise bike because
the the learned behavior in society is
that triggers an alarm bell that it's
like it's over the line and it's seen as
like i bought this for you because
you're fat which
is there's probably
situations where it's true but
simultaneously she also might have just
wanted a damn peloton but apparently she
didn't
and she's saying i gotta work out i
would start working out if i just had
the stuff here he got her the stuff and
she's mad i think i'm gonna say it i
think she's being a little bit of the
[ __ ] in this situation
if if we take opi at their face value
okay
if she really said i need to lose weight
i need to work out if only i had this
stuff here
and then he bought her a peloton
and she's openly mad at him for getting
the pe i don't know man i'm like
if she was just in like enjoying
you know
the
her lifestyle and then he bought her a
peloton unprompted
kind of an [ __ ] move
if
she said i would love to work out i just
want the stuff here
i take that in my brain as like this
problem wants a solution apparently what
it was actually is
i know that i've put on a little extra
weight i just want you to know i have a
good excuse for it please don't try to
help me at all that's all i'm saying
okay
what would you do if kate buy you a
pilot we covered that earlier i would be
stoked
because i know i put on a little weight
and i would be like yo is that a peloton
that's sick man i'm not saying you
should all
everybody on earth should be like oh
great a peloton i'm gonna say for me i
would be like that's fine
the other way around
well i mean i don't know like i don't
did i mean i i'm getting stun luck
because i just don't know how to answer
the question
i mean my wife has never expressed an
interest in in getting an exercise bike
so
i think it would just be a bad gift but
it would be a bad gift for a different
reason it wouldn't be because of the
insinuation it would be because i bought
her a peloton and then i'd you know be
in her office every day like hey can you
give me a peloton can i can i ride your
peloton real quick hey i'm just to sneak
in here for like 45 minutes and ride
your peloton is that cool with you like
it would be the homer simpson bowling
ball gift right where i would just get
her something that that i wanted to
actually have myself
i got to see the comments man i've never
felt like more at odds with society
which we are living in by the way
deleted account man this guy
he didn't do anything that wrong
did you do cyberbullied him into the
lead deleting his whole account
by the way before we get down here i'm
sure there's going to be comments that
are like you're the [ __ ]
you admit yourself things were stressful
for her and people in her life that she
loved have passed on and then you had
the audaci and i'm look
if you read it in the most malevolent
light
possible i understand okay but she said
i need to lose weight i need to work out
if only i had the stuff here even if she
said like
my understanding of
human communication which is [ __ ]
twisted obviously but if someone said i
need to lose weight i need to work out
i'd be like oh yeah me too
yeah we should totally do that and then
just keep kicking the can down the road
until it becomes a bigger problem where
the mood strikes right if she said if
only i had this stuff here that's like
the
the
executable at the end that's like i'm i
have a problem in need of a solution imo
my that's my take on the subject this i
need to lose weight i need to work out
idle conversation yeah me too oh you
know
the only thing rising in the pandemic is
my cholesterol hey if only i had this
stuff here
that's where you've invited us an extra
step in in my opinion but
okay
soft you're the [ __ ] definitely
should have had a conversation first
like asking her what kind of fitness
gear she would like and letting her be a
part of the decision
am i am okay so the conversation part i
think makes sense however am i the am i
so freaked up that like asking her what
kind of fitness gear equipment she would
like and letting her be a part of the
decision is like
i also think that the same logic applies
like if he's an [ __ ] for getting her
a bike i think if he was like hey
specifically what kind of uh exercise
equipment would you like to have i think
that's almost like the same
style of assholery
it's like you you're trapping her in a
box now one way or the other
like
i think this this creates the situation
where we're suggest look i'm not trying
to defend the peloton
company those their treadmills did kill
like a couple of kids okay
now the bikes
seem very nice
they seem very nice indeed i'm not
trying to insult the bikes okay
i'm just talking about the company
however also the ceo doesn't drink water
from glasses when he wakes up in the
morning he drinks 72 ounces of water out
of the bathroom faucet like a damn
psychopath but anyway um
i think we're maybe throwing the baby
out with the bathwater here okay
let's not it is it that he bought a
peloton that's the problem like if he
got her some uh resistance bands or like
a bowflex or the thing that electrocutes
your abs she would be like oh thank you
but don't
no bikes like i don't unders the peloton
is like the rolls-royce
of stationary exercise equipment
if she's mad that he got her a peloton i
feel like if he bought her like a a
dumbbell rack she would have freaking
like taken his head off or something
like that
i don't i don't know if the equipment's
the problem but i do agree that the the
conversation i mean everything on
am i the [ __ ] is more like you know
one conversation would have solved the
problem right like
but that's why the subreddit exists so
i'm glad that people are bad at talking
to one another
i think you had good intentions
but generally when a girl says those
things the first thing she wants is
reassurance and then you can move into
the territory of if you think it would
make you feel better physically and
mentally i can always help you find ways
to i just want to find what's best for
you
look i don't disagree but i feel like
we're we're also this is like an
evolving meta game right like i think
like maybe in the 1950s
if you were the husband who was like if
you think that's what would make you
feel better i i would just want what's
best for you would work because you
would be in like the the top five
percent of
men who were sensitive but now that the
male sensitivity is higher this is also
they they can sniff it from a mile away
you know that's like oh you're just
saying that to be nice you need like i'm
not saying you have to buy her a peloton
i mean that's
crazy i'm just saying you gotta that i
think that that's an old school
line that could work i don't think now i
don't think that's gonna get you
anywhere that's just my two cents at
least
i mean here's it again you can't you
can't flip it because i can't put myself
in in the shoes of somebody who's grown
up you know surrounded by cosmo
magazines and stuff like that
like uh you know i'd like and i'm gonna
i'm gonna pop the bubble for a lot of
men you know the the conventional wisdom
that like men get
oh men age like wine they get so much
more handsome as they get older there's
like eight guys
who you know were schlubby in their 30s
and then like in their 50s they turn
into like a silver fox the average 50
year old man is like you know it looks
like a stuffed animal that's been hug
too much and i say that as somebody
that's on that path myself you know it's
like
yes there's a lot of
tom brady and josh brolin and george
clooney and stuff like that but if you
walk down the street there's like a lot
of guys who are you know
they're coming apart at the seams
right no you're wrong totally totally
yeah totally yeah if you're like a 22
year old guy who's who's drinking a lot
of manhattans like don draper you're
definitely going to look like john john
hamm
uh when you're 45. you're definitely not
gonna look like canned ham
anyway
moving on sorry sorry people don't want
the truth bombs here today
so i i can't put myself in her shoes
specifically is is all i'm trying to say
but
i do think that if i was like i should
lose some weight and my wife was like if
you think that would make you feel
better physically and mentally i can
always help you find ways to i just want
what's best for you i would be like i
get it you're nice and i'm a little fat
you didn't you don't have to rub it in
just buy me a peloton
bra
[ __ ] you
bro
six word bruh edit
if i had a girlfriend i wouldn't treat
her like that
i wouldn't
take her idle whining about wanting to
get healthy seriously i would just
enable whatever lifestyle she wanted wow
it's oh you're such a nice guy we'd say
you say a best when you say nothing at
all buddy
i'm going to give you the benefit of
that bruh i'm going to give you the
benefit of doubt and say not the [ __ ]
now that i farmed you for karma
but dude that was a really brainless
move on your part even if she expressed
interest in it she's clearly insecure
about how she looks so the logical well
you wanted it thing is going to seem
really cold and unempathetic pelotons
are also really expensive i don't know
how long you've been dating but that
kind of investment is a little much
without talking it over first yeah but
like you you know if you break out give
me the peloton back
yo did op missed the entire backlash to
the peloton ads a couple of years ago
where the husband gets her one as a gift
that was peloton virtue signaling imo
i'm i'm there's a few things i'm willing
to dig my heels on for the most part
i'll say something and then whenever
chat's like bad take i'm like oh don't
hurt me
the kangaroo video might be digitally
manipulated and the peloton ad was not
that bad
it was just a bunch of people who wanted
to jump on it and be like i would never
do that plus don't care didn't ask plus
your bike's two thousand dollars
by the way it's
the guy in the post he never said well
you wanted it
she took her gesture not as i intended
she took it as my boyfriend is telling
me i'm too fat my intent was hey i know
you're talking about losing weight let
me help this guy inserts himself as like
uh
where was it here
well you wanted it
you said he might just be
you know getting yelled at without he
might not be going in hard is i guess
what i'm trying to say i'm going with
not the [ __ ] my wife often mentioned
to me that she wanted to work out i did
nothing after a couple of months she
finally told me she wanted a stair
climber worried about the backlash if i
did buy one i dragged my heels on
getting it look what you've done society
you proud of yourself
you made this wife's life that much more
inconvenient because of your response to
the damn peloton ad she was like i'd
love to work out wink wink
husband was like can't buy or something
i'll get canceled
she's like i'd like a stair climber
husband's like nice try
you think i was born yesterday buy you a
piece of exercise equipment you
specifically asked for i'm not trying to
get canceled
finally flatly told me to go and get it
i was shaking
in the planet fitness
told people put their phones away no
photos of me buying this stairmaster hey
who's this stare master for it's for me
it's for me okay it's for me
anyway i'm just i don't think this guy
did anything wrong
i i i can't believe he deleted his
account man
i don't think he didn't need i'm willing
to dig my heels in on this one
i don't think he did anything wrong
am i the [ __ ] for taking away a hobby
my daughter loves
it's gonna be hard for you to dig
yourself out of this one
i female 25 have a daughter that is
seven year old that is a cheerleader
when i initially signed her up it was
just for her to have a hobby my daughter
absolutely you ever hear of a damn
period
jesus christ
my daughter absolutely loves cheering
him with everything that's going on
between my ex-husband aka her dad i was
glad she found an outlet to get her mind
off all the family drama
period
throughout the summer my daughter spend
the majority of her time training in
gymnastics and dance but in her
gymnastics and then when you put the
period you put the preposition right
after it to start the sentence
did you capitalize the i
are you trying to make me have a [ __ ]
aneurysm
sorry i'm i'm leaning into it too hard i
apologize
but in her gymnastics class her coach
really took a liking into my daughter
and my daughter also adores her back but
sadly this summer she spent most of her
time with her coach more than me given
because i'm single mother and it's
sometimes hard because i also have four
other kids besides her so it could be
hard finding that one-on-one time with
her all right that's like
that this sentence has illuminated
the
the meta aspects of what's going on that
was a great sentence
my daughter talks about her coach
nonstop and all the things she does with
her and even other moms tell me that my
daughter is the coach's favorite and
paranoid side of me starts thinking this
is this relationship weird because when
i looked at my daughter and the coach
together is literally looking like
mother and daughter when school
starts to start back up again i told the
coach she can't come as much because
school's starting back up she gets kind
of visibly upset that i was putting
school first before cheer
she then offers that she comes straight
after school for an hour and a half
fully paid for my daughter really wanted
to still attend her class so i agreed
but now this week she asked me if my
daughter can join her elite team but
that means more time my daughter will
have to spend training and i can't
travel with her all the time because i
have other kids plus i have a custody
agreement with her dad so it's really
not in the cards so i told her that she
can't and we got into this disagreement
she told me i'm holding my daughter back
and she can be in the olympics that i'm
neglecting her and that she's trying to
save her to become like me which was a
mom at 18.
that was yesterday and i l cried when i
had time to myself look i'm sorry
that was yesterday and i cried when i
had time to myself because she made me
feel like i didn't care about my
daughter right now i'm feeling like i
don't want my daughter back with that
teacher it would crush my daughter if i
told her she can't see her coach anymore
so am i the [ __ ] for taking away a
hobby my kid loves
more information on the coach she
literally an abby lee miller
if anyone watched dance moms she's very
intense when it comes to training the
kids at her gym the elite team coach is
referring to is a travel team that age
group 9 to 12 year olds i did try to
look to transfer into nearby gyms but
the deadlines for registration already
passed
so i have not seen dance moms
i don't know if that's gonna
um
impact my ability to weigh in on the
decision
i don't know if i feel comfortable
weighing in before i've i've watched
dance moms
is that on uh hbo
i i go watch if it's on tlc oh that's
okay i get that
i get i get tlc um i uh
i have to be honest i feel like none of
the meaning of the post made it into my
head because i was so focused on reading
it
so i i just want to go over it she's 25
years old she has a seven-year-old child
the seven-year-old child loves
cheerleading she went to cheerleading
which led to gymnastics at gymnastics
she became very close to her coach the
mom
understandably to some extent is a
little jealous that's that's one aspect
of it um
but also is finding it difficult to
allow
her daughter to spend so much time at
gymnastics
is it because she's jealous of the
relationship that she has with the coach
or is it because she also has four other
kids which i have to imagine is like
incredibly exhausting um and i gotta
tell you we're not getting any help from
the peanut gallery on this one 43 you're
the [ __ ] 42 percent not the [ __ ]
um
i mean i feel like you're kind of
uh not the [ __ ]
for
possibly not wanting your daughter to
get insanely serious about gymnastics
at the age of seven
uh
and also recognizing that when you have
five kids like
your ability to
have any of them get like super involved
with extracurricular stuff like this is
gonna you know it's gonna put your
already
at a premium time into much more scarce
territory but you're also kind of the
[ __ ] if you just don't want it to
happen because she's becoming very close
to her coach
and i think the only person who can
really answer that is casey lee
the op
you got i think you got to go deep into
yourself you know and figure out are you
being uh are you upset because of the
fact that you know you're you're jealous
of the relationship that your daughter
has with a coach or is it literally that
it's just not feasible to do with with
your family
i don't know
beats me
she could be an olympian though yeah but
like probably every seven-year-old could
be an olympian right
yeah we need to see a video of this kid
doing gymnastics that's the king solomon
decision
if i see this kid do gymnastics because
they're doing flips and landing like
perfect tens like nadia komen each then
i'm like you're the [ __ ] let the kid
pursue her dream if she can't even get
up on the pommel horse then then no
you're not the [ __ ] the coach is
trying to grift you i need to see i need
to see video evidence of how good this
kid is at gymnastics okay
anyway it's pretty like if the coach
actually said
uh
you're holding your daughter back i want
her to not become like you which is a
mom at 18. that's pretty messed up
i mean if anything if she's an olympian
gymnast she could be a mom at 18 because
don't they retire when they're like 16
she could take her two gold medals and
just kind of like you know enter the
next phase of her life
i don't know why i'm just making jokes i
don't know what do you want me to say
gino said bye thanks for the thanks for
the gift of subscriptions thank you
thank you
i i don't have an answer for this she
seems like kind of an [ __ ]
it it seems like
her
she doesn't want her child
to
be with the coach because she's she
wouldn't have brought up how jealous she
is of the relationship with the coach if
it wasn't part of the issue so i think
if that if we're assuming that that's
part of the issue then yes that makes
you kind of the [ __ ] to
uh potentially limit your daughter's
potential because you're jealous that
she has a a relationship with a coach
that makes you feel like you know you're
not as good of a mom
as sucks by the way you know that's part
of the human experience i guess is
navigating emotions like that
um but also the coach is kind of like an
[ __ ]
for
uh
you know the things that she said if she
actually said them so
gymnastics coaches don't necessarily
have the best reputation for being nice
people so
i'm not surprised
um
necessarily at least from i don't know i
don't mean that stuff i just mean like
even um
like the you you watch documentaries on
gymnastics or gymnasts and they're like
yeah i was six years old and my coach
would like make me do the splits and
then stand on my shoulders so that my
freaking pelvis would explode you know
it's like hardcore training at a very
young age
because you you hit like your your peak
is a gymnast i think at like age 17 or
something like that
this is not phrasing like you're just
reading it in the worst way possible
it's the same way when i was like
it's like a chat full of people the same
that was like uh when i was like i
always fall asleep listening to
audiobooks like i've been listening to
the rise in the fall of the third reich
and like eight people in chat were like
a little problematic is it oh is it
it's not a how-to
it's not like 12 steps to create the
third reich it's just history
it's like you got it it's it's
it's just knowledge it's not like trying
to
get into any spicy territory
okay he's getting brainwashed in his
sleep
it's the same we play warioware
i'm like you know screw ashley there's
90 people in chat that she's 12 years
old
yeah
and
no like first off i didn't mean it like
that but then secondarily like you're
bopping me because you know the the
height of humor is that's what she said
and then thirdly it's a it's a cartoon
witch that doesn't exist in the real
world you gotta you got a problem you
gotta you gotta learn how to talk like
adults
[Laughter]
it's too much
it's not walking on eggshells you're
walking on the sidewalk and people are
trying to throw eggshells you know with
the least generous reading of what you
just said if you filter it not me but
someone who's crazy might misinterpret
what you're saying uh if you do
just shut the [ __ ] up
jesus christ
all right moving on
you're gonna run out of eggshells
am i the [ __ ] for telling my coworker
it's not my fault that she's single when
she said it's not okay for my husband to
send me gifts at our workplace
am i the [ __ ]



for telling my co-worker
it's not my fault she's okay so this is
a watermelon ass
this is part of the watermelon ass
continuum of am i the [ __ ] post which
is somebody was insecure
crossed the line and then you dropped a
nuclear bomb on them
i think i should clarify oh okay hold on
we got it we're starting with a
clarification which is
pretty rare
i think i should clarify he does not
show up to work to deliver the gifts in
person he usually sends me breakfast
because i can't have breakfast early in
the morning so when he goes to work he
stops by my favorite cafe orders what i
know what he knows i like it tells them
where the order should be delivered the
owners are his friends so he gives them
the notes to be delivered with the order
look that is very nice
but also i can see
how that would make your co-workers
dirty
dirty angry
[Laughter]
i was thinking about the the messy
boyfriend post because i glanced at the
age difference that happens later
like here's the thing i
look there's nothing wrong with sending
your significant other
food at work
but if i was hungry at work
and like my co-worker was constantly
getting her favorite breakfast delivered
every single day by her her loving
husband
i would be like man what a [ __ ]
it wouldn't be fair
just to be clear i would be in the wrong
i would be the [ __ ] but i would also
i would be mad my madness wouldn't
justify
my feeling you know it wouldn't make me
have the moral high ground i would just
instead be like
i would be i would be i'd be jealous and
that jealousy would make me angry but
that would it wouldn't be her fault
anyway
and sometimes anger is irrational right
um
and last but not least i received the
order at the entrance nobody receives
the order for me that's why i do not
understand why what bothers her so much
again i am not trying to take the side
of the jealous co-worker
i don't know what bothers her so much i
bet you take that back into the cubicle
shh
steam comes out of it
smell of scrambled eggs and the ham and
cheese croissant and you know fresh hot
espresso
just filling up the whole office
[Laughter]
oh thank you thank you for the gifted
subscriptions
happy to see you it didn't alienate
everybody
also it bothers her that i put photos of
my children and my husband on my desk
which says look okay
i get it
she's jealous okay
we
move on let's talk about the issue at
hand i get it
i just i i'm wary of any story where
they start by
digging a hole to throw the other person
into like before we've even really
gotten to the meat and potatoes of the
post she's already like
didn't
the the street swatch hr now like you
know she just keeps digging it up
ratioed
plus your bald etc etc
sadly this is not time
not the first time she says i'm being
unprofessional for have her having
photos of your children in the office is
not professional so i don't know how i
should act to please her my husband now
this is it is a 24-year age difference
that's a uh
that's a long one
that's
i can't even imagine i mean he was born
in
1971.
my
god he could have bought tears for fears
songs from the big chair at the record
store when it came out
and she's younger than i am
we don't have to go through this
discussion every week okay i
get almost every am i the [ __ ] post
has some degree of like you know
me 19 f and my boyfriend 65 right like
you you know where you stand on a year
or there my my take on this is that my
window of especially like younger just
for people whose company i can tolerate
is like
four years
and i even get pissed off like
i think apollo's 29
and sometimes just hearing him talk
pisses me off
and i say it's vice versa by the way
like he's like oh i bought some pokemon
cards and i'm like [ __ ] you middle
finger emoji
this is like a literal and i quote
middle finger how about you rip open one
of these middle finger
and he's like how's being old and i'm
like it owns jealous
anyway
he's a very romantic and attentive man
and i love that but my co-worker doesn't
like it at all
wait isn't there like a a meme
image that's like
you know you consent she can sense but
isn't there someone you forgot to ask
and it's like jesus christ
you consent she can sense isn't there
someone you forgot to ask susan and hr
good their arms crossed
nope
[Laughter]
that would that would be a gold tweet if
you captured like a paragraph out of
this and then photoshopped that image
and tweeted them both in the same tweet
oh man anyway
oh you skipped a line sorry uh he
usually sends me a rose and coffee every
day
this this dude needs a hobby i'm just
being straight up
i'm gonna here here's i'm not gonna say
this is guy wisdom like i got it all
figured out okay
because i i just i i know myself and i
know
the people that i know i don't know
everybody on planet earth if your
husband gets you he surprises you with
gifts at work now and then
that's great he's a dream come true if
your husband buys you a gift at work
every day
he
has in just my hunch at some point in
his life he
committed a capital offense he killed
somebody
kidnapped something that was involved
with the mafia like that's it's just too
much
a little bit of romance is
great stuff very admirable very
aspirational but a daily
rose
i mean
it's not just the fact that you know a
single rose is probably like 10 bucks is
the fact that like literally every
single day like there's not that many
things that people do on a daily basis
without failure every single day
like
brush their teeth maybe shower go to the
bathroom etc etc i'm i'm honestly
starting to get on the side of like
maybe like if she got breakfast in the
morning and then also like at lunch
coffee and a rose every single day
i might be like
come on it's a little much
don't you i'm starting to take susan's
side a little bit here
not the kid photo stuff that's insane
but there can be two [ __ ] in any
situation
anyway sorry um sometimes he also sends
me chocolates or food from my favorite
restaurant so every day
he gets you breakfast
from
the cafe
he gives you a rose and coffee and then
on some days he also gets you either
chocolates or food from your favorite
restaurant so in an eight hour work day
on average you're getting two to three
surprise gifts
i'm actually now at the point where i'm
like i feel bad for the wife because
it's almost like too much generosity i'm
like i just
you know you get a call on your desk
phone again and you're like hey there's
another package here for you i think can
you just put it at the front desk like
this is too much
it's way too much
oh dude
more more chicken cordon bleu from the
fat duck oh it's fantastic it must be a
wednesday
anyway sorry sorry i i keep getting stun
locked by head cannon that i made up
myself
he's a very romantic and attentive man
and i love that but my co-worker doesn't
like it at all yesterday he sent me some
croissants and a coffee with a note
saying he loved me and when my co-worker
saw it she said i should tell him to
stop that it's not appropriate to
receive gifts every day and another
worker
another co-worker told her she was just
being bitter and it's nice to have such
a loving husband that since i'm pregnant
it's understandable he spoiled me so
much but she insisted it's not
appropriate and if that it doesn't stop
she will talk to the boss she said she
will tell him she feels uncomfortable
and that i'm not being professional
enough and she wants another office mate
i gotta be honest like
i don't necessarily think that her
co-worker is right but i definitely like
the more time that it goes on the more
i'm like i can kind of understand at
least where she's coming from
like if it was the occasional gift
that's one thing i do think the
co-worker is jealous okay based on what
has been posted you never know if cause
maybe if susan wrote this post she would
be like am i the [ __ ] for getting
annoyed that two to three times a day we
get interrupted by uh my co-worker
getting a gift and everybody crowds
around her desk and goes ah
i'm not jealous or anything i just think
that it's annoying that multiple times
every single day we have to pretend that
her husband is so amazing you know like
i think if you wrote it
from the other person's perspective you
could also write it in a way that makes
her seem like she's more in the clear
so
all i'm saying is i could totally
understand
if at the office there were like gifts
coming through three times a day for the
same person
or for anybody but the same person at
least you know you could just talk to
them and be like don't you think it's a
little much
i don't know i'm not saying she's the
[ __ ]
it's none of the co-workers business
but i think we work in an office
everything's everyone's business
unfortunately
i think she should chill as well
don't get me wrong i'm just saying like
you know it's office you know you can't
even get a new pair of shoes it was that
was like my dead man walking moment i
shaved my head
while working my summer job went in with
a full-ish head of hair on a tuesday
came to work wednesday 8 30 a.m with you
know clean shaven you have any idea what
that's like you're not nobody you
nobody's minding their own business it's
so [ __ ] boring
knowing everybody's looking for anything
that they could talk about that's not
like you know microsoft excel or outlook
they're like holy [ __ ]
i do this guy didn't just get a haircut
he cut it clean off man this is like the
most exciting thing that's happened here
in like the past six months
that gorilla took my hair
i shaved my beard four times a year and
everyone freaks out that's what i'm
saying man it's not like you could be
like oh another gift
arrived so
ho hum tick tick tick tick tick tick oh
what is it this time
chicken smarmy wow congrats i got a ham
sandwich
anyway um
and that made me so mad because i'm
professional enough the things my
husband sends me don't bother anyone
like literally false
they do bother her i'm not saying that
means it's right but like why are you
lying if you have such a good position
if you're are if you have the high
ground
then why do you need to make stuff up to
try to make your argument stronger
they're not a distraction to me either
but according to her they are so i told
her that it's not my fault she's single
and does not receive anything from
anyone that maybe if she were not so
bitter someone would at least send her a
coffee and she got angry and now she
told everyone i was rooted if i don't
apologize she will talk to hr to see
what they can do with me when i told her
i didn't think of being single as a bad
thing i only said it because she sounded
like an envious person
apparently what i said hurt her wow okay
so you blew her out if we're if we're
debating who won
in the argument you won you landed the
the uppercut straight to the glass jaw
she's down for the count
i lose a little bit of respect
because then you said being single's not
a bad thing when you clearly used it as
like a
you know as a hammer blow to knock her
to knock her ass to the mat
um
yeah the king solomon solution
is get your husband to send her some
coffee
you think that would make her feel
better if
her co-workers husband started giving
her some coffee
oh man
yeah i don't know like i i recognize
that i'm not
in uh
the plurality here
with respect to chat
i think
i honestly i'm putting myself in the 35
i think this isn't everybody sucks here
i don't think she's the [ __ ]
because i mean like it's nice for her
i would be uncomfortable
getting so many gifts but some people
love that kind of attention and i'm not
looking at that as like a moral judgment
um
so if she likes it so be it
who cares you know she's getting coffee
she's getting food whatever life goes on
um but at the same time i can totally
understand
why someone else would be annoyed i
wouldn't be
i mean i would be jealous of breakfast
for lunch whatever breakfast sometimes
you go into work you don't have a lot of
time you didn't get to eat before the
before the stream oh life's so hard i'm
so busy um et cetera et cetera uh
somebody cracks open the mcdonald's big
breakfast with the hot cakes and the
sausage patties stinking up the whole
joint your stomach's growling i can see
why you would be annoyed by that um at
lunch whatever as long as i can eat a
ham sandwich who cares that doesn't
bother me
but i can see how it would bother other
people
but i think you just kind of kind of
suck it up
and when i say everybody sucks here i
really do mean everybody sucks here
i think the i think the op
sucks for
hitting the nuclear option i think the
co-worker sucks for being like openly
jealous the the photo about or the the
thing about not allowing your kids
photos there is just insane that's like
every office ever has that
not having your kill i mean what i mean
are the kids photos like them in kiss
makeup or something even then it's not
bad but like if it's just them like
pardon me in their backyard with their
golden retriever or something and like
who cares
um
that would be sick man
they were in the psycho circus or at the
magic the gathering of the juggalos um
i also think the husband is a is
a little [ __ ]
he's just i look okay maybe this
reflects poorly on me maybe this
reflects positively on me but i think
when someone tries this hard
it's scary
like something
if if if they do little gestures that
are like you know whatever and i'm not
saying he's a killer but it reminds me
of like dirty john you know where he's
like oh he's like such a nice guy wow
he's so good with everybody oh he's
threatened to kill my daughter ah
whatever like we're in love oh he tried
to kill my daughter okay oh well you
know like it's just whenever someone's
like
like for me
this is
someone's fake idea
of being a good husband with the volume
cranked to 100
like the the id and maybe it's different
from person to person but the ideal
partner
in my mind is not somebody who gives me
you know gifts
every single day multiple times a day
because then i i don't know it just
seems weird to me it's you know
occasionally they come in and go hey you
know i'm thinking about you here you go
here you go
like i don't know it seems like too
transactional to me
like you and
again this is mostly for argument's sake
right like i'm not trying to play the if
you flip the script card but like if you
were at your office and your co-worker's
girlfriend
got him gifts two to three times a day
would you be like she's a great
girlfriend or would you be like be
careful she's going to
you're gonna do something wrong that you
didn't even know was wrong and she's
gonna actually kill you in your sleep i
would maybe it's a gender bias on my
part i would be like i'm a little scared
for you because that
it seems like the intensity is cranked
up to infinity on this one
it seems like everything's happening in
those extreme margins at least
the husband has just played a lot of
of dating sims maybe
prezis
love is dead for for ryan excuse me it's
like a a a
manga reader's
view on love is that it's uh
you buy me
uh
you know
scotch and i buy you like ice cream
parfaits or something like that
she loves the beach so i bought her 10
parasols right like that's not the
relationship is you know i'm sure for
some people this it's different than for
other people but it's like you know it's
more about supporting
each other in in what you do and like
you know being accommodating and being
there for one another it's not
you know you it's not
buying hey what you can't be mad at me i
buy you 30 coffees
oh wow you weren't complaining when i
bought you those 30 coffees last month
you know this is like
it i don't know it was just weird
at some point i think i would be like i
can just get my own coffee every day
don't like you're it's not even about
the money it's like just about like like
multiple times a day you're getting
stuff delivered in my office like just
get a to go golfing or something like i
don't know like just
let let me be my own person for like
seven hours
and then like when we get home we're a
couple and then like that's good
i don't need i don't need to be it's
like you're spying on me with gifts all
day or something i don't it's just weird
to me
it isn't multiple times per day
he usually sends me breakfast
because i can't have breakfast in the
morning
one moment
he usually sends me he sends me gifts at
work every day
my husband sends me gifts at work every
day
chat message
it's
it's not liter it isn't multiple times
today okay he sends me gifts of work
every day he usually sends me breakfast
he also usually sends me rose and a
coffee with a note wishing me a good day
he also sends me chocolates or food for
my favorite restaurant so i ask you
is this not multiple times per day
or is it once per day
they're like hey by the way here's
breakfast and lunch
this is too much man
once per day that the care package
arrives a big amazon box like
even if it is a single box like i think
it's semantic it's multiple gifts
he's very romantic also like totally not
like a serial killer i just hope he has
the dash pass man
jesus christ
go to the comments oh yeah sorry my bad
everybody sucks here she may be jealous
and should not have said anything you
replied with a personal attack which
puts you on the same level as a random
person i just have to say it's weird
that your husband sends a gift to your
place of work every single day since you
met each other that's not romance that's
peeing on your property so everyone
knows it's taken romance can be public
at times but the workplace is a weirdly
public flex chat blown out i agree
the the the alpha redditor agrees with
me ergo were both right and normal
i would honestly get annoyed if my
husband sent me gifts to work daily and
would ask him to stop
am i the only one who doesn't think
ordering her breakfast is a gift dot dot
dot question mark edit my first awards
omg thanks y'all
this come on
this didn't need to be awarded who's
spending money to
to highlight this am i the o you
highlighted
uh a dae on aita
sdfu
lol
nope i'm here with you he's making sure
she's fed and feels loved
we are so [ __ ] [ __ ] man
we're so [ __ ]
does nobody else see how [ __ ] this is
i'm so [ __ ] up
plus op is pregnant so he's also making
sure his unborn child is cared for
look come on
it's not wrong but the phrasing is like
really good
oh man
you're the [ __ ] every day is
disruptive and your comment was
intentionally cruel and before you start
in on me no i'm not single
i mean that it's a little much but
everybody sucks here sending stuff to
work every day is a bit try-hard and
unprofessional why can't he get you
flowers at home because then you
wouldn't have a commanded audience for
your grand romance i would roll my eyes
as your co-worker too i'm so
it i had to go to reddit to feel normal
i had chad gaslighting me into like i
think romance is dead because i think
it's weird to get
five roses a week at work
i have to go to reddit just to feel like
a normie listen does nobody else see how
messed up this is
anyway she should have ignored it and
when she said something you could have
been less snide i worked with a woman
whose husband sent jewelry and ginormous
florals every major holiday no one
minded this is phyllis from the office
note the top three paragraphs of the po
wait wait wait so no one minded she was
pleasant and got her work done and
wasn't smug
that seems i mean sure major holidays
who's gonna say no to a major holiday
50 years old
owned owned i might get downvoted for
this
but everybody sucks here
i don't i don't read comments to say i
might get downvoted for this you're the
[ __ ] every day isn't romantic it's
obsessive and weird this is feeding me
man
i will never understand the appeal of
wanting a man old enough to be my daddy
you're the [ __ ]
man i feel so smart
not the [ __ ] this is no different to
you ordering food in yourself every day
which a lot of people do this woman
needs to focus more on her own work and
less on what other people are doing
i do respect
um
to some extent them keeping it to the
issue at hand even though i agree
um with the earlier posters it kind of
isn't fair
like if if the husband is actually like
a really nice guy
and he would read this post like he's
like wow i got my wife so many awesome
gifts because she's pregnant i'm just
caring for her and making sure she feels
loved and taking care of my unborn child
uh and then every post on reddit is like
wow this guy's an old [ __ ] pervert
[ __ ] me i guess
you know maybe he's a super nice guy i
have i'm the streamer so you know i can
say whatever i want with no
repercussions i'm just saying like if
you take it at face value we have no
reason to believe he's a bad person i
have my suspicions that notwithstanding
um we don't know it just kind of it kind
of sucks that the age gap element
becomes the focus and this is more of
like a judicial reading of how things
are going that being said it is a 24
year age gap
that's a lot
that is a lot
is it my business well
means she made the post
she didn't have to put the ages in the
post if she if she didn't want to age
the age gap did not there was no reason
for it to be added to the post
except as a cry for help is what i'm
saying it was was the age of her husband
important was it salient when it comes
to him sending the gifts to the office
every day i don't think so
i i think she put it there to be
remarked upon
whoa every single day
good
anyway what are we at 12 54. okay we we
can do we can do a couple more i love
this one am i the [ __ ] for refusing
to leave my class when my teacher kicked
me out for sleeping
so i go to a tech school that starts
very early in the morning i work late
often till 11 pm or midnight so i don't
get more than four hours of sleep during
the first 20 minutes
of class i fell asleep at my desk the
teacher woke me up and told me to leave
i said no since i'm paying for the class
out of my pocket he proceeded to refuse
to teach the class and basically punish
everyone until i decided to leave i
refused to leave some of my classmates
urged the teacher to proceed while
others started to become a bit hostile
towards me and urged me to leave in the
end the lecture wasn't given and i ended
up going to the administrators and
making a formal complaint against the
teacher in question they apologized and
said they would investigate the matter
am i the [ __ ] here you're based uh
not the [ __ ] zero percent zero
percent [ __ ]
honestly like okay
i've been through kindergarten
elementary school middle school
high school
post
high school what do you call it in the
u.s college
[Laughter]
and night class as an adult
and i taught
in korea
children from the age of
i don't know like five to 16 okay
it's
kind of like
being a prison warden
when you're teaching kids in that
like
when the kids have no choice but to be
in the school
you have a
role
as an educator
but also as maintaining the piece you're
like you're like a cop educator
they don't have to be
you know they have no choice you you
have to maintain the order in the
classroom there's an element of like
behavior control and there's an element
of education
i know people are like
no it's not like that tell me you're a
bad teacher without telling me you're a
teacher no you like you just genuinely
don't understand if you let like a class
of eight-year-olds run wild there's
nothing you could do right like you you
gotta
you gotta
respect the fam the silence that serves
as the foundation of learning okay
however
once you get in the college
you just get in you get out
you you don't have
you i'm not going to say you have no
control over what happens in the lecture
hall or in the lab or whatever but like
your amount of control is much lower
because everybody is there presumably
like of their own
volition so if some like if i was
teaching a class of like 20 year olds
and uh
you know one of them fell asleep in the
class i would be like i get paid the
same no matter what it's not like what
is their mom gonna call in and be like
oh jimmy fell asleep in like c-sharp
class okay jimmy
like
don't [ __ ] up your sleep schedule so bad
like what do you want me to do
you want me to run the class like you
want do you want me to move the class
just specifically for jimmy like so it
basically is a situation where like the
teacher
got offended that somebody fell asleep
and uh
took it as like an ego hit and then said
you know i issued an ultimatum that was
like if you don't leave i'm not going to
teach the class and then the kid uh
you know nutted up and
called their bluff honestly the teacher
is this is of extremely bad look for the
teacher they they wagered their pride on
the line and then you put yourself in
the teacher's shoes and you're like
you know they can't be like okay i'm
going to teach the class anyway because
then they i mean that's what they should
have done in retrospect but their bluff
has been called at that point and
they've lost respect which really
doesn't matter if you're just teaching a
class a night class of kids or like a
tech class regardless uh at like a
post-secondary institution but
like
i mean the teacher just
the student didn't do anything wrong
they fell asleep who cares
even if like if like a 10 year old falls
asleep in your class you shouldn't be
like you know hey wake up
you know
i mean maybe you should like
politely be like hey wake up wake up you
know
why didn't you get any sleep last night
is everything okay at home
but if they're like 20 then you just
teach the class or they who cares
they get paid the same no matter what
i mean this is like this is the most cut
and dry am i the [ __ ] i've ever seen
in my life
like you're going to tell an adult that
you're not going to teach the class
unless you leave like who's the baby
here
that's their quote even even if they do
a bad job they still get the two million
that's actually like
is one of the great things about going
in night class i i had some great
professors
i also had some professors where i was
like i think if i was 16 i would be like
well they're an adult maybe they know
what they're doing when i was taking
night class at 30 i was like this person
is a
[ __ ] up this person has no they well
when you have a good professor i'm like
whatever it's just it's a pleasure to be
here but there are some times where
you know
the professor would be like well that's
not the way it works in industry and in
my head i'd be like i can see your
linkedin profile [ __ ] you've been
teaching full-time here since like 1995
what do you know about private industry
like i'm not saying you don't know more
than me you obviously know more than me
but why are you trying to flex like oh
this is how they do it at sap or
whatever when you've been working at
this school since you know the clinton
administration you don't have to lie to
get your point across just give people
the answer without being a smart ass
or i'll take your chili pepper away on
raid my professors
if i worked there
that's too far
come on there's got to be one good one
i'm glad i've never seen that one yet
[Laughter]
this just the title on this one is so
bad am i the [ __ ] for only paying a
portion of my son's college even though
he had money from his dead brother's
college fund
why why would you for you could put like
some velvet on that one that's too much
man
am i oh here we go am i the [ __ ] for
saying i don't give a damn about your
kids let's let's get let's get spicy
okay to finish it off
i'm a kindergarten teacher my job is
mostly taking care of and entertaining
little kids are you gonna say you're
going to say she's a bastard chad
because she has to maintain order in a
classroom of little children
yep
wesley snipes meme photo me when i have
to kill tony hawk when the race war
breaks out tears going down my eyes
we got a lot of good memes today
the issue was oh wait hold on i like
kids but i don't want my own i'm happy
enough to play with them from ten to six
and call it a day from ten to six
what
is that normal
i'm pretty sure that my kindergarten
started at like 8 a.m and it went to
like noon
it's nine to five offset by one
over here okay kindergartens i know it's
an eight-hour workday i'm just saying
it's a lot of putting the kids in the
in kindergarten for eight hours
i'm pretty sure when i went to
kindergarten it was like one week you
went monday wednesday friday for four
hours and the next week you went tuesday
thursday for for four hours
in ontario it's full day now too really
i mean i guess it's kind of like daycare
so it makes trust honestly i'm i'm
looking at this not as like those poor
kids i'm like oh man that's gonna make
things a lot easier for me
[Laughter]
look i only had 12 hours of kindergarten
a week and i turned out okay
it's just like a mini mall come shop you
said flea market
i turned out just fine does nobody else
see how [ __ ] this is
um the issue was last weekend i met my
friend sharon
and see i'm fine
totally normal person and she was
talking about her nephew a lot
i know she loves her nephew like her own
and we even jokingly call him sharon's
son in each meeting i see new pictures
and stories about the little boy most
days i don't mind but i work with kids
monday to friday and a little boy
sharing a cookie with a friend and being
oh so kind is really not impressive to
me
that's
completely fair i understand kids are
not that impressive they are funny
quirky and each one of them has unique
sides to them but they are just small
humans doing regular things during our
chat sharon said wait i got a funny pic
of my nephew on a swing let me find it
so i jokingly said that's the 80th
picture wow which sparked an argument by
the way i still don't think that
she's done anything wrong here
she dropped a hint which was please
don't show me this damn photo
wow that's the 80th photo
look i'm not saying it's subtle at the
same time that's a comment that's like
i'm saying i don't want to see anymore
without saying i don't want to see
anymore
that's the way communication works
you drop a hint like that
and then you know the person then has
their own decision to make about whether
they're still going to push it a step
further
i said i'm sorry i don't give a damn
about your kid i'm here to have a drink
and have an adult conversation i see
them on a swing every [ __ ] day
look you're not a
you didn't serve in nom
like i'm sure it's frustrating but like
that's a little
i don't think you're
wrong like
in principle but the phrasing is like
come on let's take it a little seriously
which she said you're awful i feel bad
for the kids you take care of that's not
fair that is not a fair reply either
sometimes people do that to me i say i
would think it would be weird if i
got sent a rose at work every day people
are like i feel bad for your wife and
i'm like i feel bad for your wife if she
existed
hey yo
uh but she doesn't
uh or her name is pamela henderson
uh hello uh or it's mouth's mom i don't
know i'm trying to figure out what
direction we're going in
sorry pamela henderson pamela
leave him
out of this
sorry sorry mouse mom is a nice lady
yeah you're right she's too good for
chat i don't know what i was thinking
um you can't say you're awful i feel bad
for the kids you take care of that's not
look okay if you work as a dishwasher 40
hours a week
and then you like when you get home
you're like i don't really want to do
the dishes right now your spouse was
like i feel bad for the dishes you do at
work you just give them the middle
finger or something right
minus two it's not a joke
i'm just saying sometimes what you do at
work you're gonna be like you don't
wanna see it outside of work you know i
finish work like i still play video
games but i don't like i try not to read
too much twitch [ __ ]
the last thing i want to do when my when
i finish my stream is like you know
go read a bunch of comments about what
people said about it like it's crazy i
just i just went through five hours of
the fire hose
everything that comes out of your mouth
people are like 6.5 out of 10 on that
sentence personally i would have uh i
would have added a little bit more flair
to the semicolon area of the sentence
and then you know yeah i just like to
get outside listen to some podcasts
walk around a little bit get some fresh
air
um perhaps a little bit more sodium
chloride next time
um yeah the mood was dead soon after we
went on our way so reddit am i the
[ __ ] our friends are divided a bit
while they stay out of it something that
was too harsh but right to call her out
on it some people think i'm the [ __ ]
who broke her heart i heard she's
expecting an apology for me and i'm
willing to give her one if she can also
admit her fault i'll give a bit of
subtext
i didn't just blow up at her after she
got offended by my comment i told her we
should tone down the kid talk and she
said it's not hurting anyone or nephew's
a great kid and me eventually snapping
like this i didn't just blow up on her
but i just got irritated quickly when
she started to talk about how great her
nephew is even in the argument can i be
straight up with you this might be
unexpected
i think if op is telling it like it
actually happened op not the [ __ ]
this
it happens to me now and then you know
some i i'm believe it or not maybe not
on twitch
but otherwise i'm a polite guy okay like
in in the real world
sometimes people will if we're
comfortable they'll talk to me if
they're talking about something that i
find annoying or disinterested
i will
be polite
make conversation
after a certain amount of time if the
conversation is not ending
i'll start to do the thing where i drop
hints right like
well
at least you're not dead
you know at least you're not focused on
it or something like it's hard to come
up with an abstract one like out of
context but like at some point you're
like well you know at least it's over
with and then they keep going and going
and going and like well you know
i'm not sure that's appropriate topic of
conversation for now wow wow it keeps
going on and on and then eventually it
puts you into a position where you're
like you know
i would like you to change the subject
here and then you're the [ __ ] even
though you were dropping little bread
crumbs throughout the discussion to be
like let's
you know
let's let's move on to something that's
less annoying or like more interesting
than me
so this [ __ ] pisses me off you might
think that because i have a kid i would
be like wow ops being a jerk i'm
actually like looking at this from the
perspective of somebody who is talking
you know to people in conversation she
said wow that's the 80th photo
nothing wrong with that if i was showing
photos of my of my baby and then someone
said wow it's the 80th photo i would be
like all right i get it i just find her
cute and then we'll have some drinks
that would be a fun time but as soon as
somebody drops that hint
and you steamroll and say
i'm not hurting anyone my nephew is a
great kid even though you've expressed
that you don't want to see the photos
i'm just going to show them to you
anyway that's messed up man that's like
that's a shot on the bow
like is aren't you showing someone the
photos so that they can see the photo
not that you can show them the photo at
least that's supposed to be the fiction
that we're both laboring under oh wow
she's got peanut butter on her mouth
right
i get that she wants to show the photo
but you're you're laboring under a
bubble delusion that they the other
person also wants to receive the photo
if the other person's like i don't want
to see it anymore you got to stop
showing the photo otherwise you're the
[ __ ] op not the [ __ ]
whether you're a kindergarten teacher or
not
not the [ __ ]
saw an l at the whole foods on robson

gotta deal with that parking too not
worth come on man you gotta deal with
that park what are you talking about
there's a there's a lot
right uh in the dumbo in the the hanam
supermarket there's a lot in the alley
behind look i'm gonna tell it's it's
supposed to be like three dollars an
hour
but it's free
if
you shop at hanum but they're not gonna
check that like if you're there at night
they're not gonna check that you just
parked there and like they're gonna
assume that you're going to haunt them
now someone might smash your window
and steal a quarter out of your
out of your cup holder
but that's on you for leaving a quarter
in your cup holder when you parked in
downtown vancouver
that's you should know by now you're the
[ __ ] well everybody sucks here
anyway um yeah in this one op
not the [ __ ] imo not the [ __ ]
i did i got spotted at a grocery store
um
last weekend
i got in line for the self checkout
and there was a a
a person in front of me
i was stunned i had a hat
i had sunglasses and i had a mask
and they were like ryan and i was like
you got me
[Laughter]
they were very nice though they were
like well so this is the grocery store
and i was like it's one of them
it's one of them
and then they said that's such a weird
coincidence i was just watching the jug
meat stream
and i was like that's cool
it was good
i've seen you downtown like two times in
10 years but i never said hi it no it
probably wasn't me it was probably just
another like 510 195
bald guy wearing a baseball head pushing
a stroller
who walks on his toes
and is writing down everything that
happens in a moleskin this person why
don't you [ __ ] hate it when people
rush to walk in front of you and then
they slow down anytime someone walks in
front of me i immediately start
tailgating them and then i pass them
again and then i slow down
anybody else hate when you go to the
movies why is the floor so damn sticky
[Laughter]
i just keep it all up here man i just
keep it all up here
oh like you're doing right now
and why do they make them so small
anyway i



welcome back it's react court i'm
excited to be here it's been a week
um by a millennial voice it has been a
week strap in and get ready to read
thread emoji one of x so i was going to
work yesterday on the subway which i
often do go to work on the subway love
going to the subway one of the best
parts of living in new york two of x
okay you get the idea
first tweet has 15 000 retweets second
tweet has 800.
um
we're back to react court and and i'm
ready i'm ready to judge it's been a bit
let's start with the top post
everyone sucks here am i the [ __ ] for
telling a girl
that she is responsible for her own
failures
this seems like the kind of thing that
reddit would honestly uh eat up
i feel like they would be like this is
very this is very based
my girlfriend no my friends my roommates
friends sorry i went through about 17
different steps there
my roommate's friend my 22f roommate's
friend 22f is always complaining about
how unfair
life is
and how hard it is to find internships
she always whines about nepotism and
connections and blames everyone else for
her shortcomings she's also jealous of
me because i've made smart choices all
throughout college and recently secured
a well-playing job
well-paying job i can read i promise at
a consulting company for after we
graduate she started moaning about how
she can't get a job because she's
unconnected i outlined to her exactly
how i got my position i competed for
entrance in the best pre-professional
organizations based around consulting as
a freshman and since then i've been
networking and gaining internships to
experience and experience to secure
a high paying position
i'll have you know i have over 300
confirmed
get pushes
to the production branch
i graduated top of my class at khan
academy
she could have done the same but she
chose not to it has nothing to do with
unfairness or connections she just
didn't hustle throughout college didn't
network didn't make smart choices like i
did the problem is that she failed
personally not that life isn't fair and
frankly even if it was she should stop
crying about it and get to work she
hates me even more now okay okay
look
i can't believe we're we're here on
episode one
but like
i right off the bat with no extra
context i do not feel comfortable saying
everybody sucks here
everybody seems to largely be in
agreement that even if you think that
he's right this is an [ __ ] move
okay
like to when when she's complaining
about stuff and you just go
oh actually you know i i grinded uh you
know myself i was gonna say down to the
bone but that's not necessarily fair you
know if you work hard you get uh
rewarded for it sometimes but not with
you know one-to-one relationship the
fairness necessarily
um
but either way i'm i'm stunned at the
everybody sucks your votes both in chat
and in the
although to be honest there's not that
many
proportionally in the actual ledger here
um
because
there is like you got to consider the
environment that you're into okay
if three friends of a similar age are
around and they're complaining like oh
nepotism all connections you're not an
[ __ ] even if you just complain about
stuff that's not necessarily true to try
to create some relatability people come
like you have casual complaining
conversations with your peers all the
time i know it you know when you're
talking to your parents you're like yes
sir yes yes sir yes sir when you're
talking to your friends you're like
literally every problem on earth is
created by people that are over the age
of 55 even if they had no impact on
global politics whatsoever right so like
i you you
tailor what you're saying in different
situations not everything is an
invitation to be like hey you know
attack the position that i'm holding
true just for having
you know a conversation here
um
so even
if you think she's very wrong if you're
not engaging in a
debate to come at her like this it makes
you the [ __ ] just because you're
responding to like you know some griping
with like actually personal attacks
essentially um
now
the the one thing i would say
uh to to the op
is that
you're 22 years old
like i i get how it goes man like
you know that probably seems old oh i'm
so old
i'm so old i'm feeling nostalgia for the
first time oh man
like there there are actually there's
one generation of kids that are younger
than me that are in like sixth grade
right now i'm so old um but you're not
actually that old 22 is like you're a
little baby you're just getting started
you know you you're just getting out of
college to to to say that she failed
personally
is a little crazy you know like it's a
long race
where where you're at at 22 has some
influence i'm sure where you're going to
be at when you're like 50 but you got a
long way to go you know i take it from
me you know some of the people
in in my life that i knew that were
you know at 22 they were a little bit
quote unquote behind
now they're doing just fine some of the
people who were killing it at 22 you
know they got to be 30 and then they
said i don't really want to you know be
this kind of like rise and grind person
anymore i'm gonna actually take a step
back from the rat race if i have the
opportunity and and chill out a little
bit so i mean it's
it this seems like a situation where
well i mean if i can i just be rude like
i kind of feel like
op is uh
hyper fixated on academic and
professional success and they sound like
a kind of a huge nerd with
uh
maybe
limited social skills that chafe
everybody else around them just based on
the on the way that they responded to
this
essentially
um the rest of their replies are even
worse well maybe there's a teachable
moment here
um
you're the [ __ ] mainly because so i'm
saying you're the [ __ ] i'll make my
verdict okay
um
you're the [ __ ] you sound
self-righteous completely oblivious to
others in their circumstances she's
right life actually is unfair her main
complaint was about connections and you
specifically said you networked your way
to internship so it sounds like your
opportunities are based on connections i
mean i think that's true like um
i think look
i complain
well you got to be careful about the way
that you phrase this all right
there are people in my life who complain
more about life being unfair than me
but i do also think
you know life has been unfair in a
positive way for me
i i attribute like a lot of
not just my own success but a lot of
success in general just comes down to
kind of like luck and and variance if
that makes sense like i can think of a
number of circumstances like the the
first job i got
at goodwill was on merit i was a warm
body basically
um but then like the next summer
i basically got a job
because my mom knew so well i got an
interview because my mom knew somebody
who worked at the company
and then i
i for for years i was like i nailed the
interview
[Laughter]
and then uh you know you get a little
older and you're like probably maybe you
did but you know at the same time
it's uh
you know you probably had an extra foot
in the door and then the job i worked
for the next two summers uh i also
had a
a family member who worked at the
company so i again i was like man i'm
really good at interviewing like i've
only had like five job interviews in my
life and i've gotten the job four times
that's crazy like i must i must be
really impressive in the in the
interview process but then on you know
when it comes to youtube it's the same
thing as well there are people who work
way less hard than me maybe they work
smarter maybe maybe they don't but
they're more successful and there's
people who have like grinded
their you know what off and they're not
as successful
and some of that is due to like a a
convoluted meritocracy where like the
most entertaining stuff has a tendency
to do better and some of it is just like
well
you know you happen to be born in the
late 80s which meant when youtube was
taken off you had the space to actually
dedicate some time to it and then these
people on the other hand were born in
like you know 1973
and they had three kids that were going
to college when youtube was taking off
so even if their dream was to
uh
become a full-time youtuber they
couldn't afford to quit their full-time
job to make it happen because they would
have been destitute so
essentially like there's a lot of stuff
that you can't control there's there's a
lot of stuff you can control
but there's a lot of stuff that you
can't control as well so i think being
deluded into the idea that it's like a
full
you know meritocracy is a little
ridiculous
but
i do also understand i mean like i know
or have known people in my life that are
like you know
life's not fair and you're like well do
you ever consider like changing the way
you work and they're like
no and you're like okay
what you do is you don't go well then
you don't have a right to complain you
just go if i'm gonna maintain a
friendship with this person when they
complain in my head i'll be like well
you could do something to change it but
what you say to them is
yeah it sucks you know you just be
sympathetic because they're a friend of
yours
anyway
that's that's my two cents
just yeah try to be supportive
also she's 22. she'll figure it like
like six years ago she was in 10th grade
you expect her to have her have her
whole life figured out at 22.
like you you you can't i i wouldn't and
i know some people in a chat are like in
their early 20s they're like i'm an
adult you might be like you did like
legally obviously but you genuinely
might be like from a maturity standpoint
but also like i as a 32 year old i
wouldn't trust a 22 year old with a with
a menu
much less like
to have the the philosophy of what they
want to do in their life figured out in
an ironclad sense
you know for life
yeah you can't even rent a car until
you're 25 man
everybody sucks here
yes a user received
reddit platinum for this post
you are demonstrating textbook
survivorship bias the idea that
everything fell on your lap because you
worked hard ignores the very real luck
factor yeah i mean
and now i'm just like getting into my
own
like everyone loves to talk about
themselves right it took me a while to
realize this on youtube as well like i
was like you know yeah youtube sucks but
you know it worked out for me all i had
to do was you know
you you don't know
that you're the plane that comes back
with the bullet holes or if you're like
the plane that was built different and
as a result didn't get shot in the first
place you know
this this so much this user received
gold for this post this this
anyway i i mean i i think this there's
there's tons of examples of people that
have i and i think about this on youtube
and twitch a lot there's tons of
examples of people on twitch that
you know have been streaming for 10
years uh have hustled
read uh you know how-to guides about how
to make their stream better have the
perfect lighting set up uh you know try
to network et cetera et cetera and then
you know 10 years later they're in
basically the same spot that they were
uh
you know when they started and
some of that is just basically due to
like
you know you you can't always especially
in in a business
i i think like this you can't always
guarantee that hustling is always gonna
pay out you know i think it gives you a
better
chance for it to pay out but there's
also there's a lot of luck and there's a
lot of there's a lot of variance anyway
that's
fair enough
i this one dude i'm like
this one puts me in a weird
it's a weird position that's not true if
you ask daniel well here's here's where
i take on what i take on that issue okay
i dan and i have and we ran you know
check the wire together um so i think we
we have a similar idea
which is that if you
um the the way you give yourself the
best chance is by
working
you know as hard as you feel comfortable
as smart as you can
uh and and you know just consistently
doing that for like a long time
um
but i think
it's
i think in and again damn i'd even be
here you can feel free to disagree with
this it's not rude i think it's a
good it's a productive mindset
to believe that everything is within
your control in that sense
you know i'm a little bit more cynical
so like in my head
i'm like you can you have control over a
certain percentage and then a lot of it
is basically up to kismet but i think
that
you know it you you probably it it's
like a useful delusion
i think
if you're like i have complete control
over everything because then i think uh
you know that that delusion keeps some
doubt from popping in which allows you
to probably have a better chance but
anyway
that's that that's my thoughts on that
am i the [ __ ] for getting mad at a
guy for sending my girlfriend 500
flowers for her birthday
500 flowers is uh
it's a lot
that's a lot
i but i mean is it a guy or is it like
you know her best friend for life or
something like that
i would i would just be really
uncomfortable i think i hold on let's
just well
okay hold on is it one of those cool
orchids from like adaptation
like that john laroche had to harvest
illegally from a national park
hey bin setsu thank you
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank you i i had uh it took a lot of
grinder to get these views man if you if
you hustle like i hustle you too can
have people randomly dropping in and
generously giving out 10 gifted
subscriptions based entirely on merit
and nothing else
this thread has been lo oh they're all
locked so that's not uncommon
i know for a fact he's just a friend so
no comments about that i'm sure the
point is something else i'm upset
because they're better flowers than i
can afford for her birthday so anything
i get for her will be a pity she posted
it on instagram for everybody to see and
she is going to tell people there from
me and have me lie if somebody asks
they're roses too she picked the color
ahead of time so she knew they were
coming that's just really sad
so her friend
did you say he's just a friend
but look i don't know maybe that's true
your friend spent 500 on flowers gave
them to your girlfriend your girlfriend
posted them on instagram
and lied to say that her boyfriend got
them for her
that's so sad for the friend and for the
boyfriend
it's
anyway
um
he runs a flower he runs a flower store
so he was able to get them cheaper than
normal which is why
she said this is normal i got extremely
jealous
and was about to message him telling him
hey i respect your friendship but this
is too much
gf stopped me asked if i was crazy my
problem is with her not him if i don't
like it am i the [ __ ]
market value is over 1k i was being
generous to him he's not a florist but
he's a married a married
multi-millionaire who's just a partner
in the business that sells these flowers
i forgot how to read this weekend i
realized edit edit very interesting mix
of responses here gold really down votes
really fully admit i'm the [ __ ] for
wanting to message him but was surprised
how many people think it's okay for a
man married but flexible
and every every edit gets like stranger
first he's a friend then he's a florist
and he's a married married a married
multi-millionaire and now he's got an
open relationship okay to send over 100
000 worth of roses to another man's
girlfriend also very surprised at how
few people think roses are a romantic
gift you all grew up in a different
world than i did appreciate the kind and
understanding appreciate the people who
agreed with me
uh already resolved it by apologizing
for trying to text him but told her i
still think it's an inappropriate gift
thanks all here's here's all i'm gonna
say okay
like
i must have misspoke did i say a hundred
thousand dollars in roses my mistake
i told you i forgot how to read this
weekend um
yes you did okay well it's a thousand my
mistake i mean a hundred 000 is
ridiculous a thousand that's just like a
normal wednesday i'm i i spend so much
money at the florist like come on a
hundred thousand
what is what is it uh you know
your your mid anniversary
everybody sucks here because he keeps
changing his story i'm so crazy yeah
like a hundred thousand dollars is just
like a hundred dollars to me and squid
game is just like a game
i did like the reply i got on twitter
where i told hassan to watch the hunger
games if he likes uh
if you like squid game and then somebody
replied i'm so hungry the hunger games
are just like a game to me
it's pretty good anyway um
overall
i mean let me say something here okay
i think
let's assume that we're taking him at
face value and
like he's genuinely uh a
married multi-millionaire is a weird
phrase to say okay it's not just a bad
brain married multi-millionaire
let's assume that he is a married
multi-millionaire who's just a friend he
doesn't want to
engage in romantic overtures with this
guy's girlfriend um
i don't think that a
a thousand well if you know 500 dollars
in roses
is that crazy
like rich people like that they kind of
live in a different world you know
you keep like a ledger in your head if
you pay for somebody's if you're a
normie you pay for somebody's like
mcdonald's order it'll be like four
years later you'll be like hey you think
you could get this starbucks for me
because i bought that mcdonald's for you
back in 2017.
but if you're like
in the one percent of the maybe not the
one percent of the one percent but if
you're in you know if you're if you're
that high up on the on the tax bracket
you know you maybe you spend 500 bucks
on roses you forget about it
like in 10 seconds right
so i i this that doesn't seem crazy to
me
um
when you put themselves in their shoes
but it's very weird that
she
wanted you to lie and say that you
bought
the
roses for her
that's very strange
i don't know if it's like an [ __ ]
move but it's it's
really weird it's just a weird energy i
would be like nah just say like you know
my friend got it for me
my boyfriend is not a married
multi-millionaire see i can say it right
yeah i don't know it's just weird
long story short
you shouldn't be mad at the guy
you should be mad
or at least you have an issue with your
girlfriend
the guy
if we take him at face value he's just a
guy
you know he's just a very wealthy guy
who's like how much could a banana cost
ten
dollars she seems to know the gift is a
little bit over the top and the optics
of it would look bad so we have to lie
about it on social media hey just a
thought by the way like she didn't have
to put it on social media i know that
this is like antithetical
to modern existence and it's like it's
heretical um hey egg parmesan
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
i always i wonder okay because like when
somebody has
50 000 followers
on a social media platform and then they
post something for attention i'm like
yeah that's your job or like at least a
hobby but when people have like
70 followers on social media and i'm
this is not like punching down if
anything it's like aspirational i'm like
if you have 70 followers on instagram
you're s
it's not too late
you can still delete that [ __ ] and get
out you can still you can bail you don't
have to be there
anymore
when people have established it and
woven it into their career path and
stuff like that you kind of you you're
like i just i got to go to this [ __ ]
website again are you uh
having such an awesome day today [ __ ]
i hate this [ __ ] place right if you
got like you know 55 followers on
instagram don't post that [ __ ] like
eight people are gonna see it for one
just delete it and enjoy your time with
your family to enjoy this awesome gift
or something like that
i don't understand
anyway i'm sorry sorry
i apologize
instagram's down right now anyway
you're the [ __ ]
so the issue is that he got her flowers
they're more expensive than what you can
afford who gives a [ __ ] with so
engineering own two two nine nine based
this this so much this user received
reddit bronze for this post a gift isn't
about the cost it's about the thought
put into it and if you continue to
compare dollar amounts you'll always
find someone who can afford more than
you that's true um comparison is the
theft of joy
this is like man
this guy knows what he's doing op knows
what this guy's doing the guy's reading
the thread know what he's doing he wants
to get an op's girlfriend's pants that's
what he's thinking
you're either incredibly naive to think
he's sending that many roses to a woman
because they're just friends or you're
maliciously gaslighting op into thinking
he should be okay with this
op keep this guy at arm's length what
are you going to do
like if they're going to do it they're
going to do it
how are you going to stop it in the
first place good evening keep him at
arm's length
[Laughter]
you know you don't have that much
control over in the whole scheme of
things
roses are a romantic gift in most parts
of the world he's trying to woo her i
mean look there is a non-zero chance
that that's the case but like at the
same time i love the idea that like
hey everything you said about like
knowing that it's not a romantic gesture
just from your post it's a romantic
gesture
you don't
make it illegal for your girlfriend to
ever see this guy ever again
like what are you gonna do
i think everyone can relate to your
feelings
as a result you are not the [ __ ] i
don't know if that's how it works
everyone's acting like it was a damn
chili's gift card and their roses to
boot
the flower most associated with love and
passion is this not relevant
i swear if this post was a girl being
upset her boyfriend bought his friend
who's a girl some flowers it would be
what omg he cheating girl did you have
to write it like that
but since it's a guy everyone's just aw
you jealous this and that double
standards out the wazoo um
i don't know what to say
about that one it's just the way it was
phrased makes me uncomfortable
i don't know if that's true honestly
i i feel like if a married guy
who owned a flower shop
bought a girl
some an extravagant flower gift
i don't think i would look at that as if
he's like putting on airs
i think i would be like of course he got
you flowers this dude owns a damn flower
shop
his name is kushnerd
it's true
do you think it's ivanka's husband
if he owned a flower shop and he bought
her like uh
you know like a ford bronco i'd be like
yo what the hell man
but if it's
if he if he has part ownership of a
flower shop and he got her some nice
flowers that seems like
that seems appropriate
he's an investor in the flower shop yeah
but like that that means he gets you
know he's buying the flowers at cost i'm
assuming
even if he's not buying the flowers it
costs he gets a refund when he buys them
you know because he owns you know let's
say 30 of the shop or something
so it's already it's already a discount
no matter what
what if he bought her a peloton and now
we're talking
if he buy if he owns a flower shop he
knows what roses mean as a gift yeah but
like look i understand that but i'm also
like that's kind of [ __ ] you know
sometimes the flower is just the flower
like if she just likes roses you know it
doesn't mean
i don't you know it's kind of like a
dream journal thing to me you know
sometimes when you dream about falling
it means that you have anxiety over like
an impending
stress and sometimes it just means you
know you were you dreamt that you were
on the rings of saturn and you fell
through like
just happens man anyway the other thing
is again i feel like there's an extra
element here of like
you know
what are you gonna do
okay maybe he's trying to like seduce
her you're not the [ __ ] but like i'm
not sure what your what your practice is
gonna be from this point onwards like
you know
you kind of just gotta roll with the
punches and then you know act with
integrity from that point onwards i
guess
in what world is it appropriate to buy
someone i mean like look it is we i i
would feel
similar to op that's why i said op
is is only the [ __ ] for taking it up
with the guy i think it's it's
appropriate for the girlfriend to be
like hey you should
thanks for the flowers next time do not
give me
such an extravagant gift because it's a
little weird
so i don't think it makes opie the bad
guy
that he's mad i think him having the
issue with
the his rival is kind of the
the that's the issue that maybe makes
him the [ __ ] whereas it it's really
it falls on his girlfriend to be like
hey please
you know don't do that in the future
also lying on social media is super
weird hello jay by the way hello
new glasses who it is now these are the
same glasses it's uh
i'm just using a filter this is a
tick-tock it's called the ceo filter on
tick-tock
am i the [ __ ] for telling my husband
we're not spending christmas with him
this one just seems like it's gonna be
sad
am i the [ __ ] for telling my husband
we aren't spending christmas with him
today my husband and i got into a huge
fight about christmas in particular
santa
okay because i'm assuming you have a
child and you want to tell them that
santa is real and your husband doesn't
because he's a stem lord that's just my
guess um okay not not a stem lord
appears to just have a different
religion but anyway christmas has always
been a huge part of my life it's my
favorite time of the year i believed in
santa until i was 10 or 11. chat close
your ears
i by the way i believed in santa until i
was
12 i think i've told this story before
but
uh
my parents went out one saturday to buy
groceries i was just home alone at age
11 or 12. um
and then
when they came back it was like march
right they were like we got to tell you
something the easter bunny's not real
and i was like yeah that makes sense
like i'm 11 i'm not an idiot and then
after that
i said you know
it really makes you wonder about santa
claus as well
and they kind of they went okay
look look look we plead the fifth on
that one you got us
etc etc so that that's where it all fell
apart for me
it's a very only child story that makes
sense yeah i i'm not mad like
[Laughter]
it's not like it really inhibited my my
life too much um
but anyway 10 11 i'm sure is late but
it's not that crazy i asked a lot of
questions and was told by other kids
that he wasn't real until i admittedly
knew deep down but just loved the magic
of it all i still do my husband chris
i am assuming asterisk means name is
changed to protect the innocent
uh never celebrated christmas as he is a
muslim he only started participating
when we met 11 years ago he knows how
important christmas is to me every year
we go to the christmas events light
looking the whole works our son louis is
for
chris chris kringle perhaps and my son
um saint nicholas
he's very articulate and has started
talking about christmas and santa in
particular writing him a letter i told
him it was a bit early but that we would
definitely do that closer to christmas
then i left for work i came home nine
hours later and lewis was acting strange
he wasn't crying but was clearly upset
i presumed he had gotten in trouble
because he was acting similar to if he'd
been scolded or gone to timeout i asked
chris why lewis was upset and after some
pressing chris told me that he told
lewis santa wasn't real he told lewis
that santa was based on saint nicholas
and how he was turkish just like daddy
look i don't i don't know if that's true
but that's just a very funny thing to to
say
and be like you know i'm gonna blow up
this kid's whole spot i'm gonna i'm
gonna i'm gonna blow up this kid's
illusion of the world just to tell him
that santa and his dad are the same
ethnicity
i lost my mind we had previously agreed
not to tell lewis that santa wasn't real
until he started asking questions about
whether or not he was real the magic i
experienced my son during christmas is
so special and i'm angry my husband is
prematurely taking it away
i'm angry that he has ruined my child's
magic when it comes to christmas my
husband showed absolutely no remorse
said i'm an [ __ ] told me it's not a
big deal i feel like if roles were
reversed and i'd said something about
ramadan or something he values he'd be
furious okay
but
look i know i know where i'm going with
this one
but like
christmas has a religious significance
but santa doesn't have a religious
significance
you know it's like
it's chris christmas is you know
celebration of the birth of jesus christ
on a religious level
santa's just like a guy santa's like the
the hallmark jesus christ
he's like he was invented by like toys r
us right at least in his modern sense
what are you gonna make up about about
ramadan like
you're gonna be like yeah john ramadan's
not real what are you talking about
he was invented by coca-cola yeah that's
that's what i'm saying man you're
blowing up
warren buffett's spot like you're not
you know it's it's on a different level
i told my husband that lewis and i would
be spending christmas in my hometown
this year four hours away and then he
wasn't invited if he was gonna be a buzz
kill he's a good husband and father but
his lack of remorse or care for
something i value has made me furious he
thinks i'm overreacting okay here come
the edits
lewis has not asked if santa was real
but it was instead talking about the
north pole and my husband decided it was
a great time to tell him santa isn't
real and saint nicholas is turkish like
him
i don't think i was clear in my post um
but i'm upset that he undermined me and
our agreement and was without discussing
with me i feel blindsided and like what
i value doesn't matter husband okay yes
i mean
like
headed for we are divorced now
um
look
i'm
this is a tough one okay
i genuinely even though it's kind of a
funny one
it's also kind of a tough one
you can't just be like
hey everything in our marriage is
totally fine you're like a great dad and
a great husband but you're not invited
to christmas like that's
that's over the line it's uh that's the
sp that's like the the most well you
know it depends it's wrapped up in
culture and it's wrapped up in religion
but at least in
you know i mean i'm an atheist and
christmas is like the holiday that i
hold most sacred because my family gets
the most time off
so it's kind of something about that
december environment is
you know
it's it's sacred in an extent like the
idea that you're like 11 months of the
year we're married but like that one
month of the year that is like perhaps
the one of the most important we're like
you just like live on your own for that
one
um
and also what about his presence right
uh you can't just you can't cancel the
prezis on him
but
he also
definitely did something he shouldn't
have done
ignoring the fact that at some point the
child will find out that
santa's not real to begin with
you know if they had an agreement that
they were gonna tell him when he's four
who cares if they had an agreement
they're not going to tell him until he's
18 who cares well that's funny but who
cares but
him just being like oh by the way
santa's not real but also the guy he's
based on is turkish just like me
is
hilarious
to imagine the conversation but also
it's a it's a [ __ ] move
is my two cents at least i uh
i would say
for me this isn't everybody sucks here
i am oh and i this is the
it's the not the view and the plurality
seems like we got a 66 percent not the
[ __ ] 25 say everybody sucks here i i
look
i don't know i mean
like
you you can't
like you're not invited to christmas is
like
the warning shot you fire before you
serve somebody with divorce papers
which is why i'm like
how can
she be like everything's fine
but you're not allowed to celebrate
christmas with us like that's what's
weird to me that's why i think she's the
[ __ ] in addition to him being the
[ __ ] as well
he def he broached
the bubble first
but she
i mean i think she took it a step too
far now the question is not who's worse
did both people do something wrong
yes i think both people cross the line
now let's see where i diverge from
reddit as a whole
[Laughter]
not the [ __ ] this degree of
maliciousness is really deep jealousy
and envy resentment i don't know but
your husband drew blood with this and
you need to ask him why
what
he drew blood
i just
tell me you watched it's a wonderful
life 75 times uh a year as a child
without telling me you there look i like
christmas there are some people who
re they like like christmas you know
what the kinds of people who are like
and now if you're if you're in this
group this doesn't mean you're crazy i'm
just saying you know like thanksgiving
ends and immediately they're like the
christmas tree grow goes up we're
watching a christmas movie every day uh
throughout november and december except
for the fact that you know there's only
been four good christmas movies ever
made um you know
you get the idea like they turn the
radio station to the christmas music and
they they listen to it for you know 10
of the year even though there's only
been three good christmas songs ever
written so on and so forth
and this
when you she i mean he did really
draw blood it also doesn't really sound
malicious
i mean
you think he was he had like like foam
coming out of his mouth
i'm about to end this kid's whole career
hey did you know santa claus is turkish
what an [ __ ]
i'm really sorry i love this i know
we've never met i'm really sorry
shouldn't have done that i agree with
the top comment the best thing you could
do is talk to him about this
first it would be nice if you posted it
all on reddit so we could all get you
whipped up into a frenzy about how your
husband's a piece of garbage and then
okay but then you should go talk to him
i doubt this is the first time he
sabotages your parental decisions
without telling you that's look he made
a mistake that's too far man
that's j come on
it's like every time you have a
oh hey i said i was going to take the
garbage out oh sorry i got busy i forgot
to take the garbage out how can i ever
trust you ever again what if you say
you're going to be there for me if i get
sick
and then i get i get sick and you forget
about it it's like come on i just
forgot to take the garbage out once
everyone just chill
out your husband is not only an [ __ ]
but he's an ignorant [ __ ]
nicholas was a byzantine greek the turks
didn't show up for a few centuries later
this
based and history pilled
not the [ __ ] you can fix this for
your son by telling him santa only
brings presents to people who believe
he's real so dad never got to have santa
because he never believed and that's why
he thinks santa is fake okay look
i know that chad's gonna be like this is
creating like a weird precedent for your
child
look it's a kid man like if if it works
it works who cares you know you get
bigger problems
you are doubling down on a lie or on the
truth with a lie
but like he's four like
it doesn't matter
it's like
this is not in my opinion at least this
is not where things start becoming
unwound and then like 40 years later
they're like
you know
it all went wrong when they kept feeding
me lies about santa okay
this is whatever
this this doesn't strike me as a big
deal
okay you're not the [ __ ] is it is
anyone gonna talk about the fact that
like
you know disinviting him to christmas is
kind of extreme not the [ __ ] but
unfortunately you're married to one it's
so funny to me because this is like a
this is like a curb your enthusiasm bit
like larry david
accidentally letting people know that uh
you know letting a kid know santa's not
real
and then everybody's like [ __ ] you you
bald [ __ ]
it's not it's a it's a dick move but i'm
like i'm feeling bad for the husband a
little bit here like everybody's going
off man
not the [ __ ] he did it sneakily on
purpose your child was upset did his dad
comfort him at all did he dismiss your
child's feelings as well as yours is
that a good father i don't know anything
about your relationship or your history
except for what you've said and you said
he was a good father but based on this
one post i think you might be a liar
this is crazy man
the husband is confused that that's
probably an understatement
also
at the time the area was greek and is
now on the southern coast of turkey
not the [ __ ]
look i'm i don't disagree with the not
the [ __ ] to an insane extent i'm
just wait look at how many comments we
had to go through before i found you
know somebody that that at least had
some sympathy in this situation for like
he threw the first stone but the
response was also maybe a little over
the top
yes your husband shouldn't have told him
but
instead of taking your son away from
celebrating christmas with his family
you could have spun this another way
talked about the real meaning of
christmas
hey
faris
aulia
thank you so much for the generosity
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank is it christmas
and they said santa wasn't real
and that he's from turkey when actually
he's a byzantine greek
and the the area only became turkish uh
several years later um thank you thank
you
appreciate it
santa brought it early
you could have celebrated the real
meaning of christmas also known as
spending time together with loved ones
yes santa's not real but there's other
things that are in the spirit of santa
generosity kindness happiness
you do realize you're going against that
by taking the kid away from his dad what
you're teaching is that when somebody
makes a mistake we abandon them
ffs that means for friends sake um maybe
this issue goes deeper for your husband
maybe he feels excluded and make a bet
made a bad choice in telling your son
either way you're not gonna solve
anything by threatening to spend the
holidays elsewhere three months in
advance i agree i agree with this
comment
i'm not trying to defend the husband
like
i i think that that's
a it's a [ __ ] move especially if you
promised that you weren't gonna do it
but like the reply to that is crazy
well okay over the top let's not say
crazy but
you know it
disproportionately
aggressive and scored
punitive as compared to the
the the problem in the first place
should september still be in the title
uh well nothing has changed
subscriptions are 20 off for the month
of september
it is um
october 4th but
september is like it's still a thing
it doesn't
it's not really
germaine to the current situation but
[Laughter]
i have calmed down a fair bit now and
can see why he feels excluded from the
whole christmas thing and wanted to bond
with our son by saying that santa was
faking based on saying nick who was
turkish just like my husband it's like
does she have this on the on the
clipboard she have a macro for this
exact sentence
sorry this is not germaine to the
situation um
he's at work but i'm definitely going to
talk to him about whether this is the
case and if it is i'm going to try to
find a way to make him feel more
included we don't live in turkey
so i could definitely empathize with him
missing his home country and potentially
wanting to make that connection between
turkey and something our son loves by
telling him this i do disagree with him
flat out saying santa isn't real
especially without talking to me and i
am still upset
but it's very out of character for him
to be inconsiderate so now that i've
calmed down i can see it's definitely
about something deeper rather than him
just wanting to change up how her son
views christmas without me
absolutely not that's a profoundly
offensive thing to say about a greek
christian like saint nicholas it's
guys guys guys i feel like we're getting
in the weeds here about the
origin of saint nicholas okay
i feel like that's the semantics maybe
it's a different discussion that we can
have at a later date i don't think it's
necessarily relevant to the situation at
hand
saint nicholas was greek
saint nicholas was a roman citizen i
agree
were da vinci and michelangelo italians
most people refer to them as such but
they live long after the italian
unification here's the thing you called
it ejecta
which is not true
a jackdaw is from the genus jackass dos
sorry that's like an ancient reddit
meme from ages ago but um
da vinci
your husband is wrong by the way saint
nicholas was in turkish she was greek
uh depending on how pedantic you want to
get saint nicholas was either roman or
lyceum while he was of greek descent the
region in which he lived in
hadn't been under greek control for over
a hundred years by the time he was born
uh that's like saying jesus was roman or
that cleopatra turned roman after the
roman conquest jesus was a citizen of
judea paul was a roman nicholas was a
roman citizen born about 190 years after
the roman empire took control of lycea
he had greek heritage
just wanted to say i've been loving all
your responses
who [ __ ] cares like
[Laughter]
she pisses me off
okay okay
in germany we celebrate saint nick on
december the 6th kids clean their shoes
or boots and get little gifts of candy
in them maybe you can find a similar
tradition to include the turkish saint
saint nicholas wasn't turkish
hey hey germany
nice tradition
don't care didn't ask plus saint
nicholas wasn't turkish this is this is
crazy man
all right well we've spent too much time
on this one
not that i haven't had a great time with
this one but
oh man
they're really hung up on this saint
nicholas thing
nobody even wants to talk about the fact
that we can all agree
maybe we don't know is he lycee and is
he roman is he turkish is he greek is he
byzantine i don't know what we all know
is that he's got a belly that when he
laughs it rolls like a bowl full of
jelly can we all agree there
can we all agree that he's got a belly
that rolls like a bowl full of jelly
and he hangs out with the polar bears in
the north pole
actually he's lean



and he's not turkish okay
he's drinking cola with the polar bears
man am i the [ __ ] for filing a
conduct report on a co-worker who had
emotion an emotional breakdown
that very much depends i would say
on the situation
what a title a co-worker experienced a
death in their immediate family the day
they returned to work at some point
towards the end of the day as they were
doing a task i asked if they could try
doing the task in x-way instead they
exploded at me and yelled about their
dead family member and how they just
want to scream and cry and don't tell me
what to do i was terrified and shocked i
called our manager in the calm down
calm my co-worker down and our manager
encouraged them to go home they refused
so our manager told them if they were
insistent on staying they'd have to
apologize to me they apologized to me by
apologizing for their family member
dying and again i was shocked and so
uncomfortable and disgusted i explained
to them that i'm sorry to hear about the
death in the family however that is not
my issue and if something in their
personal life is preventing them from
doing their work and they believe
they're allowed to speak to me in that
way because of what's happening then
it's probably for the best so they go
home
the co-worker cut me off and cut me off
and said like you're doing right now
i've said i'm sorry that's it done i'm
not having a conversation about it
i ended up filing a conduct report on
this person
edit
we work with children under four
oh
oh okay like in a daycare or something
cause i thought that
this was like a like a cigar rolling
factory in like the in the 1700s
i was picturing like a bunch of people
on the line and like every third person
was a kid under the age of four or
something
oh
man
okay why would you think that i don't
know i mean
it depends on the definition of work
with right like i'd anchored to the idea
that we're talking about co-workers then
when they say work with in my head i'm
thinking like you know i work with
you know this guy who had an emotional
breakdown and also children under the
age of four
um
anyway
this one's it i hate to say it for me
this one's too cut and dry
your friend is not like or your
co-worker i should say is in the wrong
no question about that and like
you know i hate to say it it's it's
always easier as like a rational
uh
observer with no emotion tied up on the
outside
it's understandable that they blew up if
they're not ready to be back at work um
but then to
have a little bit of time to cool off
and then still be like instead of being
like sorry i'm just upset right now
because of stuff going on in my personal
life instead being like
nah man like
frick you
[ __ ] i think that makes
like they've doubled down on it you can
totally understand why
um
they would be rude
i don't do it honestly like
i don't i don't think ops the [ __ ]
maybe
sure okay look a con
adding a conduct report on the end is
probably too much that like i don't know
what the hell that means
i guess it means that it gets looked at
by hr or something and then they get
possibly reprimanded or written up or
something um
so to like if
i would like to think that if it
happened to me
i would be like you know let's let this
simmer for 24 hours and then i
completely understand why you're upset
let's hash this out i know it's not
about us
that being said i also i mean i don't
feel like ops being too much of a
[ __ ] in this situation
can i say it also depends on
sorry
also depends on what they
backseated as as somebody who gets
backseated on occasion
if they were you know like doing
something unsafe and they were like hey
can you do it like this instead
that's fine
if they were like hey don't tie the kids
shoes like that use the bunny ear method
instead i might be like you know what
listen up you little [ __ ]
i had a hard week
okay i know how to tie my shoes do i i'm
not stupid i'm smarter than you are you
you're gonna try to backs oh hey hey
have you considered hey you ever thought
about doing it this way yeah okay
yeah i thought about it and i decided
uh that's not my problem okay
anyway
i make four times what you make well you
wouldn't know it from your suit
you ruined my life
anyway
i mean this is that's just sad co-worker
probably shouldn't be back at work but
had to be back at work for economic
reasons um
nobody sucks here everybody sucks here i
don't know
it's just not fun come on stop posting
real stuff man
start posting funny stuff
i don't know one
i don't know the the the terms of
service on not safe for work text
so am i the a-hole for kicking my friend
out of my party after she had blank
blank blank in the bathroom maybe we'll
skip that one down here but
am i the [ __ ] for telling the
professor that i am in fact a customer
and have the right to expect good
service okay here
i don't know
but what i am going to say is
i am comma in fact comma a customer and
do have the right to expect
and i quote good service that
is just the way that that's phrased as
like a shower thought comeback
it has primed me in the direction of
being like
you might be okay but let's see
i-20 f have one professor in particular
who pretty much no one likes students
can't stand him he has terrible student
reviews
on rate my professor and other platforms
but i had to take his class if i want to
graduate with honors in my chosen degree
program okay
so far so so sane
he's a very archaic professor his
teaching methods are highly outdated one
thing he does is curve grades which is
when you artificially lower the grades
of people who earned a's or b's to be
season d's just to make it so only a few
students are allowed to succeed even if
others
learn earned a higher grade okay so
here's my thought
on curving
you cannot
curve down
you can only curve up
curving down is like a war crime
if somebody got a 95 on your exam
because you didn't make it hard enough
and then that makes you upset you don't
get to be like well somebody got 100 so
i'm gonna take you know you down to like
an 80 instead okay
curving down
is
is nasty
i feel like it's one of those things and
admittedly like i don't work in stats
but like
what if you just had a a a cohort of
classmates who are smarter than the year
that came before
like you know the law of large numbers
if you had a class of a hundred thousand
people every year
the the
dissimilarities should even out but if
you got a class of like 50 people you
could easily have like you know
five idiots or six idiots in the class
one year and the next year you know half
of those idiots get replaced with
geniuses and all of a sudden like you
know why why are you normalizing
everybody into that situation
so
within a class you're like okay i got a
56 because i was like the 11th
worst in my class or something like that
but you're 56 you might have gotten an
80 on the exam whereas last year
somebody got a 56 got a a 20 on the exam
and got cranked up anyway so this is
look i just don't i don't i don't
respect
the the curve down a curve up is
generous if they do it i think that's
nice
curve down is the way i look at the
curving down is like
your
your professor
[ __ ] up if they made it too easy
you don't get to punish other people by
like possibly you know lowering them
under the requirements for their
scholarship or something like that just
because of the fact that you made it too
easy and you're upset anyway that's just
my thought on that okay
curving down should only be allowed at
the urinal but dumb bump
anyway that's that's good that's good i
like that
it's a good joke i was gonna make a joke
which is
i don't even have enough to curve but
now i just now i just feel bad
time to drink some blue juice
cheers
anyway
um yeah just so he can brag and say my
class is so hard
our college's administration
is very critical of the practice of
curving and ask professors not to do so
it's considered even more ridiculous
when the class is in a stem class the
administration allows students to file a
request with a grading board if they've
been graded on fairly by professors to
resolve the issues in grading
my professor graded me completely
unfairly on a recent assignment first he
gave everyone in the class the answer to
a particular question on the assignment
which he designed incorrectly
so he was just giving them points due to
his mistake i wasn't in class because i
had a cough
and even though it wasn't corona the
administration makes us quarantine if we
show symptoms he never told me the about
the answer he gave to everyone
okay
that happens like
like i know how that sounds but yeah
sometimes you're you're sick on a day
where nothing gets taught and sometimes
you're sick on a day where they
introduce like the most important
mechanic of all time
so on the assignment i i told you in
third grade i missed like three days of
class and as a result even to this day i
have no knowledge of grammar
i know what a subject is in a sentence i
don't know what a predicate is i'm going
to assume it's everything but the
subject
i don't know what an adverb is i don't
know what uh
i only did in the last decade i've only
found out what pronouns were
you know it's been a long road for me to
approach some level of of
competency with respect to grammar
you taught english i know
but like it's you i was teaching english
as a second language in you know second
in south korea
you're not going like
uh you know this is an adverb you're
going like the apple is red
for like all day every day
you know hello jenny how are you i'm
fine thank you and you hello sally how
are you i'm fine thank you and you hello
sarah how are you i'm fine thank you and
it's just that
hours and hours every day
if one of the kids was like what the
heck is a is a predicate i would be like
how about we just focus on learning what
the yellow fruit is and then we'll talk
about predicates when we when we get
there
anyway
so on this assignment i was unfairly
docked several points because he didn't
tell me the answer he gave away
from the whole class because i was
forced to miss class due to quarantine
i'm getting mired in the weeds i'll
admit that's your problem
that that i was on your side up to this
point for sure that is not the
professor's problem it's not his
responsibility to make sure that if you
miss the class that you're caught up
he's got other things to do
everything else i get okay
the administration would consider this
an unequal playing field oh my god shut
the [ __ ] up
shut up
the administration would consider this
an unequal playing field all students
are supposed to have an equal chance of
scoring well in the assignments
unfortunately none of my classmates will
talk to me and give me their notes
because i
speak to them in a patronizing fashion
missing these points lowered my grade to
the borderline between a and b and then
the professor so it's a wave just a
thought here
what about the other questions you got
wrong
so you were on the borderline presumably
you got more than one question wrong the
question that you couldn't possibly have
gotten right because you missed the day
where he gave you the answer uh all the
other ones though hey hey man those ones
what are you supposed to do you just
sometimes you get them right sometimes
you get them wrong but i deserve to get
that one that i got wrong right
missing those points lowered my
borderline so my grade was artificially
lowered to a b so that he can brag about
how only x people got a's on the recent
assignment the whole situation was
unfair from start to finish i never even
had a fair chance to do well
i argued heatedly with him about it and
he said
i argued heatedly with him about it and
then he had the audacity audacity to
nastily say to me youth these days you
all think the customer is always right
but you aren't customers and don't have
the right to a certain level of service
to which i corrected him actually i am
by definition a customer i don't pay 80
000 a year to be cheated out of the
grade i rightfully earned by
first 80k like
let's be realistic you're not paying 80k
maybe your parents are paying 80k more
realistically
fannie mae is paying 80k a year you're
probably gonna end up paying like 130
140k a year by the time it's over okay
so like as long as we're being highly
specific let's just make sure everything
is absolutely on the table here
um
i've already decided i'm never asking
this guy for a recommendation for
anything so i have nothing to lose at
this point i'm escalating to the grading
board to have them review what happens
so i can salvage my grade am i the
[ __ ]
um
it was not in the notes
he verbally gave a freebie to the class
and he has expected per university rules
to tell quarantine students if they miss
something crucial and it's not in the
notes there's no situation in which i
could have known about the freebie
like
i'm just look okay
i feel bad because like
i do think she's the [ __ ]
and i think the professor is the [ __ ]
too but i'm like
you kind of just
like
you gotta be okay like
obviously here's the thing is it
possible that this b screws up the whole
trajectory for her life
no
but it's possible that she does believe
that i believe if there were huge
consequences for the the b she would
have put them in the post because she
put a lot of details in here that made
her case look as
flattering to her as possible like for
example i had a cough it wasn't corona
but i would have gone to class with my
cough and gotten everybody else sick
except the university [ __ ] wouldn't
allow me as a result i missed the
professor giving out an answer and there
was no way conceivably for me to
possibly get to the point where i could
have gotten it no one will tell me that
because they've all kind of academically
blacklisted me um because i talked to
them like they're stupid um
long story short like i don't i mean can
i can i be honest with you i actually
think
i i kind of don't think she has a leg to
stand on and i understand that might
make me
that might make me the [ __ ]
on top of the situation
i feel like if you miss the class
and then you get something wrong on the
exam
because you missed the class
it's your responsibility
that's that's all like i i don't really
have anything else to say about it
like like
i can understand her frustration you
know you miss a big day
and then you you're you know you feel
punitively punished as a result
however
at the same time it's like
if you get sick you miss a class you
talk to your classmates you go like hey
what did i miss you know you take their
notes and copy them down yourself
etc etc the curve down is stupid that's
like
100 i i'm not on the teacher's side when
it comes to that i just don't know like
what the professor is supposed to do
they're like supposed to individually
email all of the students that are sick
you know for one reason or another and
be like hey by the way
just so you know 35 minutes into my 55
minute lecture i said that the answer to
question 16a was like
you know this
i just i mean i don't i don't
that's his job well you know
no
i i don't know maybe maybe it's a boomer
take i don't think your job as a
professor is to
you know in in an undergraduate lecture
email everybody who is not there on a
given day and make sure they're all on
the same page you can all be on the same
page by either attending class or if
you're not able to attend class then you
get the notes from your classmates you
know like you distribute the load out
there
i don't see it as his job at all to make
sure all the students are on the same
page i see that as the student's
responsibility
youth these days
you're so convinced that the customer's
always right
i can't even read chat it's going off so
much
you're ignoring a lot of context
i don't know what context am i ignoring
the curving down i'll admit
that at worst it's everybody sucks here
because the professor is definitely an
[ __ ]
i also think that op
is like really whiny
the context is we're in a pandemic
obviously but that you know that doesn't
mean that the professor's job
is to make sure that everybody who is
quarantined also gets all the notes why
can't the students get the notes from
the people that were in the class
okay just email your classmate and be
like hey did i miss anything in the
lecture today at which point your
classmate goes yeah he gave out the
answer to question 16 that's going to be
on the exam
we have a different
i mean admittedly i didn't go to college
during quarantine
we have a different
mindset or i have a different mindset
that chad that's all i'm saying i feel
like the professor's job
is
research
and then secondarily
it's to present the same 35 lecture
slides
uh
over and over again to incoming class of
freshmen and then distribute the marking
to all the tas
that's basically it i don't i don't
think they have a i at least when i when
i went to school and admittedly i didn't
go to school during covid
even though when i went to night school
and stuff like that when students missed
the class it was always their
responsibility
to make up the difference
i don't i don't think she's a bad
student i think she's just like
i think she's just
a little high strung
read the edit yeah okay like look you
read the edit at per university rules
what does she know
okay i'm just saying
i'm bringing a lot of my own bias into
this but i'm like i don't think that she
necessarily knows that that and
admittedly i'm going against what's
written on the page but there's a part
of me that's like
you know
nobody reads those
i'm just like look
i think that the professor should not be
curving down i i i accept her premise
that
the professor is a bad professor is
hated etc etc i've had it before many
times
i just i take issue
with her
deflecting responsibility at every turn
that i guess that's where it comes down
to me like the whole thing is just
steeped in i never had a chance hey
we're suppo the university says
everybody's supposed to be on an even
playing field and yet i was uniquely
discriminated against because i had a
cough that wasn't covid and there was no
he gave away an answer
during the lecture and as a i couldn't
be at the lecture there was no way for
me to there were no means for me to
actually get that answer for myself like
it's it's
look
if she's right in principle then then
she's right in practice i guess as well
but there is like
i i think it's everybody sucks here
but she doesn't suck for the way that
she talked to the professor i just think
she sucks for
being like a little bit too
just just a little bit too
obsessed with going from b to a that's
it
now her being annoying doesn't actually
make her like an [ __ ]
but it it does kind of
make me less likely to be a hundred
percent on her side
i don't know look i've had bad
professors as well all right but i also
i i find myself um
you know putting myself in in the
professor's shoes right just just not to
give him too much sympathy but i'm like
you know
50th time teaching the class
you know he's got a lot on his plate
not that the students don't as well
and then like he's you know this one
person is soaking up
like more attention than the rest of the
class combined and i can see to some
extent why he might be like man i wish
this girl would shut the hell up
i can understand i'm building my own
head cannon okay you're not wrong i'm
building my own head cannon
but i'm just saying i could i could
totally see because i've had night
classes as well where i was like you
know
the professor occasionally like gets
into it with a couple of students and at
the end of the year you know there's 40
kids in the class you know when one of
them puts up their hand and they start
asking some inane question that's never
come up in reality you and a couple of
the other people in the class just look
at each other and go like
here we go again
technically um i said that uh that this
data type was a long long on the quiz
and i got it
right but then it turns out that the
right answer was long but would i still
have been right like is it something
where like all
longs
are also long longs or is it something
more like all long longs are longs and
i'm just asking just in case like at
some point
in the future like maybe when i work at
microsoft like during my interview i
might have a question
like this and i'm totally going to
remember this i'm going to lock it away
in my memory palace um so i just want to
know like when i get asked at the
interview is a long long along or is
like a long long just a different kind
of uh is it a different data type
together or is it a double or is it and
you're like man we only got an hour here
and you know we're good we're gonna end
up going late just because you like the
sound of your own voice
oh look at this cutie baby
hello
hey
hey
hey baby
where's your nose
oh
kobe
hey
holy crap she did it
your eyes
eyes
eyes
a little ambitious i think guys i was
going i was teaching her eyes today eyes
eyes where's your
ear
only only i can pick my nose on stream
honey
your glasses i had to i had to just put
my picture up for like 20 minutes to
just burn out all the new glasses new
glasses new glasses new glasses new
glasses
though they'll get used to it
they don't like it it's not they don't
like it it's just that have you ever
seen like the way that they the internet
reacts to like a uh
a youtube layout change or a twitter
layout change or like a font change on
reddit like it takes
it takes 10 years for people to be like
ah actually it just looks normal now
sheesh
okay
you're like
dada
bye
there he goes
oh and now oh tomo would like to come
out too
ah it's all right in like five seconds
they'll start beating the door down to
get back in
no i'm not worried about um
i mean can i be honest i kind of i love
being in the why are you booing me i'm
right situation
i'm not courting the controversy of
calling this lady a butthole
just to court the controversy i'm just
being
i'm just giving you my honest opinion
which is why i kind of like uh
i i find it enjoyable
otherwise you could just make up like
the the consensus opinion you know
how dare that jerk professor who
probably you know is his wife's probably
cheating on him how dare he be so rude
to this she had no chance to get the
answer right you know what i mean
but that's not the way that i wanna
it's not the way that i wanna uh
approach this i mean like i'm here's the
thing i'm like i'm very laissez-faire as
a student okay i worked hard at least at
the stuff that i cared about but
you know whenever somebody was like my
entire self-worth is wrapped up in never
getting a b ever and then they soak up
you know
50 people's time with their own petty
squabble with the professor i'm like
[ __ ] both of you honestly like just
grow up
some of us are just trying to get out of
the lecture
get a head start on the project and
invest our time in a way that it's like
most uh appropriate and efficient rather
than like have to watch these two like
supposed adults you know put their egos
on the line for something that's
irrelevant for everybody else
anyway
we're just going to scroll past the one
that might be tos how about this one
uh am i the [ __ ] for telling my wife
she doesn't look good in her favorite
dress
seems like the answer is yes
i male 42 and my wife f39 were trying on
some clothes the other day to go out we
both gained some weight since the
pandemic since we stopped going to the
gym but are starting up again my wife
tried on her old favorite dress which is
tight and since she gained weight it
just doesn't look as good i didn't say
anything
i didn't say anything at first okay but
then when she asked i told her honestly
i don't think it looks as good as it
used to i like your black one more
because it's slimming she got mad at me
and started yelling i told her sorry if
your feelings are hurt are you stupid
like are you just a dumb idiot what's
wrong with you
why would you even post this
you're dumb
like
it's
you're 42 years old man come on
like
it's it is it's a literal sitcom moment
okay
i don't know
i don't even want to look at the
comments because i've seen everybody
loves raymond i know how the situation
plays out but like
i just don't understand
yeah you're the [ __ ]
i mean especially if you're you're
insecure you're going to the gym you
both you know you put on weight during
the pandemic none of that makes you the
[ __ ] but when she's like do i look
good in the dress
i mean
look
maybe this is naive but i'm like
she's your wife for one
she if your husband she probably looks
good in the dress in your eyes to begin
with i don't even think you need to lie
you know i think you just
even if you're like oh you know she's
gained weight
you just go like yeah you still look
great
i i
maybe the black dress looks better but
like i i just don't understand like you
actually
here's the thing i bet he thinks she
still looks good
in the red dress
but he's just
he's too smart to realize he's dumb i
guess is what i'm trying to say he
probably thought you know would be nice
is i'll just i'll tell her that the
black dress looks better because it's
slimming and then she'll be really happy
because
you know she'll be like oh i like the
black dress too that's not very smart
you can't be honest you can be honest
without being an ass yes correct
you're the [ __ ] you knew you were
mean stop playing dumb dude this
gentle you're the [ __ ]
sure okay you're the [ __ ] you're the
[ __ ]
honestly as a large female myself i
don't think you're the a-hole she should
have calmly taken your opinion as you
had clarified it was your honest opinion
and she should have been happy you
didn't just say what she wanted to hear
yeah okay
um
i always
as long as it's someone's honest opinion
you can't get mad that's i think how
human beings work
she should have just rationally
dissected your opinion and said well as
long as you're being honest no worries
going against the grain here and saying
i am not and saying not an [ __ ] i get
so tired of this trope that men have to
lie to us if we ask them how we look in
something if a person doesn't want to
know the answer to a question don't ask
the question
bro come on
husband bot 9000 wifebot 9000 logging on
your thermodynamic needs have been
oversupplied recently yes thank you they
just
you're just people i don't know like
yeah you like i mean just be realistic
like you lie
to people like a hundred times a day
99 of those lies are lies that you make
from a noble position
of being a good person and being like
you know hey what you just said was
really funny when in your head you're
like it was okay you know you just
you know i don't i don't think it is a
little high i think that's a pretty
realistic number i don't think your lies
are like i was at the grocery store but
actually you were at like the number
five orange you know i i think it's just
uh
you know it's it's the it's the way of
human communication is that you know you
you
lie
to flatter people you you misrepresent
things to make the conversation flow
more freely like absolutely
what you just said was really funny see
and then i could be like you're lying
but in my head i'm like
i would even it's it's cypher in the
matrix right
even though i know this steak isn't real
even though i know the matrix is just
telling me that it's delicious
ignorance is bliss
when people are writing plus two
and lol la mao this is the funniest
thing i've ever heard i know that
when they're at their computer they're
actually just like
lol
plus two
plus two lol right i know they're not
sitting at the computer going
most of the time but uh
i choose to believe when i see the lulls
i imagine a stadium of of laughter in
front of me
and what can i say
joey pantaliano was right
ignorance is bliss
anyway here's what i will say okay
i think it depends on
the couple
yeah i think you know each other right
like
kate is honest with me a lot
sometimes she'll be like those pants
don't really look like they fit anymore
and i'm like not offended
that's cause
nobody can damage me with their words as
much as i can damage myself with my
internal monologue so like i do
appreciate that honesty i'm like you
know what i'm gonna go up a size next
time
but for most people you you kind of feel
it out right
especially like if somebody comes up to
you and goes like hey are you like hey
do you like this new purse that i bought
you don't go like
i don't really understand it
you know you just go wow it looks super
cool
i don't know
the guy in the matrix saying that about
the stake was a villain
you and i get a different read from the
matrix
my reading of the matrix is that
capitalism is the only villain all the
individuals were merely products of the
machine
through which they operated
i can understand if you only got a base
level reading of the matrix ooh bald guy
bad bald guy bad he unplugged uh
whatever their names are i don't even
remember he unplugged glitch he
unplugged glitch balled the guy bad i'm
like nah man society bad
society bad
just call me grimes
am i the [ __ ] for making my teenage
daughters
bedtime hours sweet my work schedule am
i the [ __ ] for making my teenage
daughters bedtime hours sweet to my work
schedule am i am am i the [ __ ] for
making my teenage daughters bedtime
hours suit my work schedule
this depends
would it suit your work schedule if she
slept from 11 p.m until 8 am
or does it only suit your work schedule
if she sleeps from like 11 a.m until 7
pm because that's uh
i think that'll change things slightly
oh my god dude this is too long
this is too damn long
this is too
damn
long dude let's read it my 17 year okay
hold on up let's do the update later
this is not rashomon okay
my 17 year old teenager and i have
frequent arguments about bedtime when it
is not a school night she will stay up
until 3 a.m in the morning playing video
games on a school night until midnight
that
is actually
when
as as a child well as a late teenager at
17
that was about my schedule i go to bed
around midnight
on a on a weekday maybe 2am on the
weekends this seems fine
well i understand it's an important way
for her to connect to her friends we
also live in a very small place her
playing video games and chatting keeps
me up at night when i have to wake up at
6 a.m for work each morning that's also
fair if you're doing like voip or
something like that that's that would
that would annoy me as well fair enough
we have a one bedroom basement suite and
my bedroom is in the living room there
is only a pocket door between where i
need to sleep and where she's in the
living or the bedroom playing online
with her friends i'm afraid we will
disturb the other tenants that live next
door the landlord upstairs which
increases my anxiety as well
tonight i got up rather than lying in
bed and sat in her bedroom just so she
can tell how long she is actually
keeping me awake she stayed playing her
games for another hour from two to three
a.m and just told me to take sleeping
pills if i can't handle it okay that's a
dick move but she is also 17.
so
not a surprise
straight up okay
um
let's let's continue there's a lot to
work with here
she does nearly no chores and she by the
way okay like this is
parent-splaining okay
when you are complaining about the
behavior of your child
i'm not saying you have complete
one-to-one control over what your child
does
but the complaints you have about your
child reflect on you
as well as the child so when you're like
oh my [ __ ] daughter doesn't do any
chores i'm like well
you know
how did that happen like did if you
wanted her to do chores did you start
putting that groundwork in when she was
like six years old to get her like give
her like responsibility bit by bit or
did you just treat her like a roommate
and you're like now she's 17 she's not
doing any chores and that's upsetting
anyway
she does nearly no chores has few
responsibilities she doesn't leave her
room on the weekends until noon
she attends school regularly earns
average grades does all her homework but
no additional studying or prep okay so
she's a person uh in my daughter's
opinion i'm an a-hole and a
b-r-t-c-h she has trouble making friends
at school i should be supporting her
spending time with her friends when they
are available they mostly graduated in
the last two years and they work until
midnight she feels like my bedtimes of
12 a.m on weekends or holidays is
unreasonable
this is am i the
am i the dick for saying this doesn't
seem that bad
like can't you just find a resolution
where like at midnight she turns off
voip or something like that like you can
still play the games
as i don't i i feel like she shouldn't
as long as her 17 year old
goes to school
and doesn't you know like
drop out
then i feel like she should be her
bedtime shouldn't matter she seems
normal
as long as you know she's she's not
disturbing you the problem is not really
her bedtime it's that she's just like
you know
she's just being loud on the voip which
i understand
to answer a few anyway to answer a few
more questions my daughter did do chores
for much of her life she had a really
rough time of it last year as she came
out as trans and even stopped schooling
for a few months that she felt
uncomfortable being there but we worked
through that this is when chores and
such went by the wayside as my bottom
line was school attendance and all work
at school being completed she has
learning challenges as well so she may
never attain more than average grades
but she should be achieving more with
dedicated study
she may never get more than average
grades but she could be doing better
than average grades
okay i mean i i understand like all of
the context okay she does use headphones
when chatting with her friends so it's
not their discussion but her excited
chatter when she's playing this all
makes perfect sense
can she not just like be quiet after
midnight
that's what just
like why she can even be on the voip but
she just can't say anything like or she
maybe she could like whisper or
something like that at least
excited chatter i mean i'm just like i
mean we went through the same thing like
my uh
me and my parents went through the same
thing obviously the context was not the
same but like
with summer vacations i would stay up
until like 2 a.m playing
halo 2 uh
on on xbox live
and then like
my parents
would be like
hey can you not be so loud and i would
be like okay sorry
and then we we just made it work okay
that would i i
we didn't live in a one-bedroom house to
be fair but you know it's i feel like if
you can't sleep because of
clickety-clack on the controller you can
adjust to that
that's something that just event for
most people i think it like falls into
the the din of ambien noise
people
inconsistently talking shouting laughing
you can't really like turn off your
brain and not interpret what they're
saying like that stuff i understand
completely but
um also i'm not poor i'm a single mom i
actually have a graduate degree and earn
a good salary but i'm not willing to
spend more on my on rent as we live in a
high cost of living city oh sure okay
like that's i understand
that's all fine
i don't think op is the [ __ ] in the
slightest here
i think it's very reasonable to be
annoyed by your daughter's voice
communication
after midnight um
let's read the update up here
it was a good wake-up call to me i
shared your responses with my daughter
i'm sure that was nice hey honey i
posted on reddit and thousands of people
have weighed in on the situation with a
limited amount of context to help us
come up with a resolution
um
she knows that as long as she respects
quiet time rules then wi-fi won't be
unplugged if she doesn't then it is she
also agreed there's no reason for her to
complete there's no reason for her not
to complete her chores i'm assuming oh
that's a great update man there's
nothing wrong with it so the whole
like i'm not trying to be upset okay but
the whole thing was basically like
i told her she can go to bed whatever
she wants as long as she's quiet and she
said okay the end like
okay i didn't i didn't need to know this
much about
your family up to this point i just
anyway
hey honey we took our quarrel to reddit
and decided that the best
well we've decided that uh
you and i are going to get a divorce and
uh also
you're malevolent plus santa was in
turkish anyway he was probably lysean
but it seems like the jury's still out
to some extent
am i the [ __ ] for asking my wife to
get her name
my name tattooed on her
no
my wife and i have been together since
we were 16 married for five years we
have one son she dared me to get her
name tattooed on myself i did it okay
not the [ __ ]
i recently told her she should get my
name tattooed on her so i don't feel
like such an idiot she said she's
against tattoos and that i'm abusing her
by expecting her to ink herself up
so she doesn't want to whatever but i
guess she told someone who then told our
entire family that i was pressuring her
to do things she wasn't comfortable with
and her stepdad wanted to have a chat
with me
i dislike her stepdad that guy is the
worst but the guy literally took it upon
himself to stand up at dinner and
express his concern started subtly
hinting at me trying to control his
pride and joy i told him to go to hell
and now i'm the bad guy what the hell is
some people are
too
stupid to be uh
alive
i want to be clear i'm not saying that
they should die
i'm more just like surprised
that they made it far enough to
for their
juvenile brain
to get into this situation as an adult
i guess is what i'm trying to say
um
like
okay we've been together since we were
16 married for five years we have one
son great story so far
she dared me to get her name tattooed on
myself i did it you're stupid
i recently told her she should get my
name tattooed on her so i don't feel
like such an idiot just throwing it out
there if you didn't want to feel like
such an idiot
you shouldn't have gotten a tattoo in
the first place until you had some kind
of like
mutually assured destruction set up in
advance or like maybe
you could
go into the tattoo parlor at the same
time and get it done or something like
that like this seems like a situation
where you're
like look she's the joker based on this
i don't know what she's doing
but
he doesn't get
he's too stupid to be mad
i know how it sounds like it sounds like
i'm being a [ __ ]
but like if kate was like get your name
tattooed on me and then i was like i
came home with like kate tattooed on my
butt cheek or something
and i was like okay your turn and she
was like are you crazy no i would be
like all right i'll take the l on that
one you got me
i really should not have done that i
don't know what came over me
fair enough well played
to the victor go the spoils
but you know what i would do
after that i would go back to the tattoo
parlor i would just get them to change
it to
skate four
and then people would be like they
wouldn't ask any questions
they would be like that's a great tattoo
but if your wife's name is like
esmerelda or something then you got some
problems i don't know how they're gonna
change that maybe they could just be a
big fan of like the hunchback of notre
dame or something like that but
anyway um
i just like i i
honestly it sounds like
you're dumb and your wife is uh insane
she's like a a batman villain and you
know like are are you okay op i guess is
what i'm asked because it kind of seems
like this is one of those preambles
where like later you know you go over
for thanksgiving and they're like we
have this game we always play and then
the game is like hide and seek but then
it ends up with them having like weapons
and you're like crawling through
like the walls of their mansion and
stuff like that trying to escape like
that this feels like it is a situation
where you thought your wife was your
ally but actually she has a closer bond
with her family uh that she grew up with
than anybody else um because they're all
in this weird cult and then you're just
kind of like the newest like at some
point you're gonna go over for
thanksgiving and you're gonna be like
who's that and she'll be like oh that
was my ex-boyfriend and he's gonna have
like a mustache or something like that
and then later you're gonna be in the
basement
and you're going to see a skeleton with
a mustache and you're going to be like
oh [ __ ]
it's going to be something like like i'm
just concerned
a great big bushy beard
i'm just concerned about you
in this situation
but why would you get
uh
oh is it is there not like a hippocratic
oath for
um
tattoo artists
there's no they don't have to like make
sure you're of sound mind i know that
like they're supposed to make sure
you're like sober or something but
i don't know how much that actually
happens in practice because i never
gotten a tattoo
like there's a good shops will make sure
you're sober this is an honest question
though like if i went into a reputable
tattoo shop
and i i
said i want you to tattoo like a
realistic phallus on my cheek
and then they were like what do you do
for work and i would be like i'm the
mayor
a reputable tattoo parlor would still be
like
all right what did the whatever the
customer wants the customer gets
i guess they don't have a leg to stand
on to say no but i'm like
you know what they should do all tattoo
parlors should have like ombudsmen
like like two people have to turn a key
at the same time to open up the vault
that holds the tattoo gun
and before you get tattooed you have to
go
here's the tattoo i want here's why i
want it and then two
a jury of your peers have to be like
that seems acceptable
and i i think that would eliminate it
would probably cause some false positive
situations
don't get me wrong where like you really
want a tattoo but it's very hard to get
people to agree to it
it is your
it's your right as an adult to have that
kind of freedom i suppose but i also
feel like it would help
i'm not blaming the tattoo artist okay
i'm just surprised that nobody
more juvenile than me has ever been like
you know we need to stop these tattoo
artists from tattooing the dumb [ __ ]
that we came up with on our bodies with
our consent
i would have thought that at some point
somebody would have gotten something
idiotic tattooed on them and then been
like i'm gonna spend the rest of my life
lobbying the tattoo industry so that
this never happens again
what's next a license to
get tattooed by my own toaster
all right let me just
not the [ __ ] but i'm also petty
enough that i would get something
tattooed over her name so maybe you
shouldn't listen to me
i mean like you should at this point
like she's the joker
you should get the tattoo messed up
absolutely
this
i mean i'd i think you'd be silly if you
didn't at this point
comment deleted by user
okay well thanks for your help
everybody sucks here never get a tattoo
of a name unless it's your child okay
yeah i mean
i see your point but after she refused
the tattoo i would have suggested a
cover up of your tattoo with her name
after she requested name tattoos are a
horrible everybody knows nobody is what
what about the part
where she is like you're trying to
control what i'm doing with my body and
then she got her stepdad involved like
this is nasty man like it's not about
everybody you know what to be like a
genius to realize you shouldn't get
someone's name tattooed on you
especially not without like uh
a tit for tat kind of solution there
i'm just saying
anyway
i want to read more comments but i also
have to go to the bathroom so i think
that's going to do it for react court
today we got some good stuff i i love a
uh i love a react court where i was in
the minority for for one of the uh
episodes as well that's then later this
week i go to youtube and i'm like why
does that have a 92 like dislike ratio
instead of 98.7 and i'm like oh that's
the one where i called that 19 year old
college student a [ __ ] my mistake sorry
sorry anyway um react court
two



and plans i had with my stepdaughter to
spend time with my my bio daughter
possibly not
seems like probably not but they always
write the title like yeah obviously
hi all i've been part of my 12 year old
step daughter abby's life for five years
and been married to her mother for the
last two she's a lovely kid we're very
close she sadly doesn't have any contact
with her bio dad but i've tried my best
to be there and be supportive for her
abby and i always do something on
fridays when she's finished school
clothes shopping or go for ice cream
watch a movie if it's warm to go to the
park and play football
[ __ ] dick
[ __ ]
bill gates 1v1 me thank you for the
gifted subscriptions thank you
i appreciate it i can't pass that
challenge uh along i don't know how to
reach his people but i i'm rude and i
don't know if i'm rooting for you i'm
rooting for you right now but i don't
know we'll have you seen him he can jump
over a chair
however i also have a bio daughter
rachel
she is 23 and has always lived with my
ex how unfortunately she got herself
sent to prison i won't go into detail
but it wasn't serious she was only in
there for six months
it's just a hidden run the cops said
it's like not a big deal
the person she hit wasn't even like a
real person sort of they weren't even
supposed to be around in the area
we were never very close but we began
writing to each other when she was in
there and i visited her a few times i'm
going to employ her at my business
rachel was released in the morning she
headed straight to my ex's place but
called me saying she'd like to see me in
the evening i didn't want to cancel
plans with abby but it's important to be
there for rachel i texted abby my
apologies rachel and i went for coffee
and then did a bit of shopping i got her
a couple of new dresses and a new
handbag a handbag
i thought it was only fair to get her
something nice after she was worn prison
gear for six months it was a good day
and next week we're gonna start her
application to my company when i got
home my wife was in a complete rage she
said i let abby down and she was glad to
know what my priorities are abby was
crying in her room and told me to go
away when i knocked on the door i'm
truly sorry for making abby so upset but
what else could i have done rachel's my
child too and she's just endured six
months of hell but i had to be there for
her as a father and help her rebuild her
life especially as i haven't been in the
past am i the [ __ ] not the [ __ ]
in principle
could you have just hung out with your
stepdaughter and then moved your
uh
daddy-daughter date with your daughter
to the next day or something like that
yeah like in principle
you probably could have done that
however i would say that there's like a
few exceptions in life where like
you know you kind of one social
gathering like takes precedent over
another one one would be when your
daughter gets out of prison i think that
you could be like hey abby maybe we
could like do something a little later
my daughter just got out of prison
like for six months she was incarcerated
so we're just gonna like she really
needs to spend some time with like her
father
right now
um
just for a night and we can just go get
ice cream tomorrow or something like
that
don't care didn't ask plus she's a felon
um yeah so like my interpretation is i
think very similar to chats on this one
which is
the stepdaughter can be mad she's 12.
so you get mad at everything man
um the mom
has an obligation to be the electrical
resistor on that circuit and look at
this situation
not emotionlessly but but from a a
bird's eye view of the situation and be
like is it okay that my daughter's upset
yes
does that mean that my husband was out
of line
spending
you know a couple hours with his
daughter who just got released from
prison no so you just take the heat
basically and then the next day they
wake up and they're probably fine or
like you know a couple days or something
like that um
you sometimes you just you know you just
gotta
basically eat someone else's emotions
and soak them all up
because you know you'd be people get
frustrated with one another for unfair
things so
overall
um
i mean it's not the [ __ ] there
doesn't have to be an [ __ ] if there
is an
[ __ ] then
i think i think his wife was kind of an
[ __ ] here but
anyway
um
i i do want to read the you're the
[ __ ] she got out of prison man
she
that's a big deal
bro just let her watch netflix tonight
take my daughter or her stepdaughter out
for ice cream instead
it's like she was in prison
orange jumpsuit
you got a one friend and it's a mouse
you keep it in like a little jar then
there's like an [ __ ] prison guard who
kills your mouse and you go
you know what i'm talking about brooks
was here
michael clark
duncan know what i'm talking about
that's two different movies but
one of them's the green mile the other
one's the shawshank redemption
you know she was just in prison for six
months you know the warden is cooking
the books so he can lie in his own
pockets while making the inmates uh live
in decrepit conditions
there's a huge man named john coffey
there who might have some connection to
the other side you know what i mean you
might be able to talk to dead people or
something like that i can't remember i
haven't seen it in about you know 20
years
you know rita you got posters of rita
hayworth you're using a little spoon to
dig out the the the cement every night
you're crawling through a mile of [ __ ]
anyway
i am waiting for
i'm waiting for info what was she in
prison for
um
not the [ __ ] this is a one-off yeah
okay we don't even need to read this
this is like that's just you're too
smart
not the [ __ ] people in the comments
are acting like she's six six instead of
twelve
she's all sixes and sevens basil not the
[ __ ] people don't get released from
prison every day it was a one-off thing
yeah man
not the [ __ ]
about oh here we go
this guy is sam elliott at the bar
a boss once told me you can get away
with anything if you do it right you're
not an [ __ ] for what you did but
you're an [ __ ] for how you did it you
treated a 12 year old like an adult who
understands complex relationships in
history okay sure yeah
you owe your wife and the girl a sincere
apology not for what you did but how you
handled it okay you owe the girl an
apology
you do not own your your owe your fully
grown wife
an apology what you owe her is an
explanation that's like hey i understand
that abby's upset but my daughter got
released from [ __ ] jail
maybe you could cut me some slack
[Laughter]
she got released from prison this wasn't
like she was like let's hang out tonight
you know i'm free
she was like let's hang out tonight i'm
free
holy [ __ ] not the [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah
not the [ __ ]
not the [ __ ]
no [ __ ] but you did the screw-up
i believe that opie was not the one who
was incarcerated
info did you know she was being released
that day was she released earlier or
later than
schedule
exactly right op says they wrote letters
and he visited daughter would have known
her release date she probably knew the
day she went to prison since it was a
six month sentence even if the release
date was moved up they tell you he could
have moved the day with stepdaughter or
told daughter i have planned see you
tomorrow
i thought this was like the end of the
comment like
like honest this is not like i don't
disagree but it's just like sometimes
people like
they make mistakes you know
like your whole
if your whole
purpose in life was just to be a meat
computer that handles this one
interaction as best as possible you
could dedicate 16 hours a day to to
making sure that nobody got offended by
this you have no problem but sometimes
people you know sometimes you're like
i'll take the garbage down and then like
12 hours later the garbage is still
there and you know
you don't respond to that with like you
know
why did you lie you responded that with
like oh sorry i got distracted doing a
bunch of other [ __ ]
so i had a bunch of other stuff going on
and i'll do it right now you know like
so yeah maybe he knew the date in
advance but you know he's probably got
other stuff on the go
you were wrong for how you did it it's
not like you got a phone okay sure all
right you're not wrong i just disagree
with the severity
am i the [ __ ] for turning my
husband's office into a library for
myself without telling him and refusing
to give it back
i always think let me let me hydrate
here
i always think about like um
remember i've told this story before in
seventh grade
my teacher told me um
well she told our class that
at the end of the day we would play mind
trap which are like brain teasers that
you pull out of an email hey you're
trapped in a room with three light
switches and three and uh on the other
side of the room is three light bulbs
how with two switch flips how could you
figure out which one did what you know
um
and you you turn one on
you turn another one on for five minutes
then you turn it off you leave the other
one off you see what light is on the two
lights are off then you feel them to
feel out which one is warm oh
right anyway um
she told us we would do
mind trap at the end of the day we ran
out of time my friend got into an
argument with her for like
40 minutes which is the teacher should
have known
we got to stop this but you also it's
not like you get a notification that's
like we're about to start a 40-minute
argument like are you you sure you want
to do this like it just it starts of
like you know one second and then it
just blossoms and you're like it's too
by the time you know you're in it it's
too late it's quicksand right yeah this
is the one where you know he was like a
reddit comment he was like you said we
would play
mind trap
at the end of the day
we're not playing mine trap right now
my parents told me not to respect liars
and you lied your your move your move
you're the [ __ ]
and it's like
you know
it's just if then but there's no like
tolerance built in for like sometimes
[ __ ] happens
you know what like an earthquake at the
school oh we all got to evacuate you
told me we played mine trap you you liar
anyway it's just that i get that
i get a i get a lot of that uh energy
from reddit from time to time
am i the [ __ ] for turning my
husband's office into a library for
myself without telling him and refusing
to give it back i separated from my
husband about three years ago he moved
abroad and i stayed in our marital home
three years is a long time i never
thought we would reconcile so after the
first year i redecorated his office and
turned it into a library for myself we
started talking again in the last seven
months decided to reconcile he moved
back home this week and he was upset i
had taken over his office without
warning since he needs it more than i
need a library
he's especially upset since there were
other rooms in the house that i could
have used but i could have i picked his
office because it had the perfect view
and layout plus i never thought he was
going to come back anyway so it wasn't
like i ever thought he would need it
again he thinks i was trying to erase
him from the house and i could have told
him before i did it since it was still
his house despite us living separately
info i'm already in like info territory
here my husband wants his office back
carlito wants his hand back and wants me
to take another room as a library but i
feel like it would be easier for him to
pick another room and start fresh the
reason he wants the office back is
because it's the perfect location for
him not to be disturbed by noises from
the rest of the house and he had this
room specifically designed to be his
office when he first moved in he's upset
at me because i don't want to move my
library to a different room
you are not going to
make it
ngmi it's not this
come on first off do you live in the
overlook hotel
how many rooms you got there's so many
other
this is not relatable okay
like
there's so many other rooms in our house
but i don't want to move my library like
it's not even a bathroom like just to
have a library
is a luxury to begin with but then to be
like i don't want to move my library
because it has the perfect view like
it's
it's just you're already not relatable
okay
i'm not trying to make this about me
this is reddit or move i streamed from
what was literally supposed to be like
the closet you put your shoes in for
six years something like that guy the
the
thermometer in my office was like
regularly breaking 30 degrees celsius i
was sweating through all my clothes
taking two showers a day and you won't
move your library
it just seems like a little bit
silly to me considering that you know
you're trying to like form a life
together
either way
i back when i lived in the poison
factory
um
there's there's info i'm surprised that
we're not looking at a lot of info
requests here okay
because
if
you both own the house
if you're 50 50 on the house
i don't want to necessarily turn this
into a legal thing
but
he has a right to pick his office
maybe
if it was your office you he wouldn't
have a position to be like you got to
move your office to put my office there
but the library that's like it's got to
go like the library is just a lower
priority
three he maintained the house she
maintained the house for three years on
her own well yeah but like i also want
to see the mortgage statement like
just just because someone doesn't live
in a place for three years if they're
still knocking out the mortgage payment
like that still matters it's not like
they lost ownership of the house as long
as the checks were still clearing
still matters
that's what i'm saying is also not
relatable like
who can afford to like
have a house and not live in it for
three years i don't know some people but
it's a lot
i don't know like i'm i'm like
everybody sucks here i guess is where
i'm coming at this from
i think she should give
the library to her husband
to work as his office because the office
takes precedence over a library i also
think that
he should just
be in a different office
because it seems like a real pain in the
ass to have to like remodel the house to
move the library to another room
can you find something you agree on like
do you guys eat separate dinners or
something like that it's just
it's just a it it's just bizarre
some of these other ones are like you
know am i the [ __ ] for like shooting
my attacker in self-defense and this
one's like i don't want to move my
library it has the perfect view
but my husband doesn't want to have his
office elsewhere because the noises from
the rest of the state will bleed into
his you know perfect hermetically sealed
environment
it's just weird man
i don't i don't know what this i'm just
going with everybody sucks here
expected you to have an office ready for
him for three years are you sure you
want him back
look this
is a very samantha thing to say
everybody sucks here don't remarry your
ex
the [ __ ] what an excellent
reconciliation sarcasm detected and
challenge accepted
he left for three years and then moved
back to immediately start complaining
you were erasing him and is upset with
you for not warning him that you took
over the office exactly why tf are you
getting back together is that like the
number one deal breaker for people is
like
you know they're surprised you like
remodeled
yeah you know what this i want to write
a reply here that says honestly like i
just don't care your problems are not
real
don't get me wrong they're real to you
everybody's problems are real to them
but your problem is not real to anybody
else come on
just setting
bro just set up like a folding desk in
like
you know the utility room or something
like that you can make it work
this is not a this is not a real problem
everybody sucks here
can you not compromise yeah can you like
not just can he not just put a desk in
the library and then well you know what
you know what's going on here she's got
that
thing decked out with like more plants
than the amazon rainforest he's supposed
to have
clients over they got a step between
like palm fronds and ferns and stuff
like that
you know they got one of those
bookshelves that has like the
long-haired plants that are like hanging
over the front of it
people are going to come over and be
like i don't think i want you to handle
my accounts
you know it's happening
it's there's no room for him to put his
three foot diameter globe that opens up
and it has like the cheapest scotch
money can buy inside of it this the way
he seals the deal i i can understand
that when you put it that way now it and
i i completely get it
makes a lot of sense
i do want to know
more about the the home though
like if he owns 50 of the house i still
think he should get a say in the office
like it's a weird situation to buy a
home as a married couple separate but
not divorce i think
and then
be
weird about the rooms when you come back
you gotta come to a compromise it's just
a it's an unusual situation
it's just it's just strange okay
everybody sucks here
i don't care about your problems anymore
let's move on
am i the [ __ ] for using my savings to
pay off my parents mortgage and car
how does this become
i am the [ __ ]
there there must be a a very
a dirty bomb hidden somewhere in the
pros here
oh my wife originally said fine all
right i can tell where this is going
i put away a little bit of money from
every paycheck since i was a kid i used
most of it 77 000 to pay off all my
parents bills that they were committed
to make monthly payments towards which
included their mortgage in my mom's car
just to help him out because my father
got in a pretty serious accident he
might not be able to go back to work at
least not anytime soon
so someone had to do it and i figured it
was my responsibility my wife said i
didn't know them anything and they
hadn't asked for help so it didn't make
sense to help them but my dad would
never accept outside help he'd rather
skate by on social security than do that
it's like if someone who can't swim
jumped into the pool and you see them
start to sink are you gonna wait for
them to ask you before it's too late
leave the metaphors to me buddy okay
you just dropped a fax out here
i'll come up with the analogies all
right
my wife originally said fine i'm not
hungry anyway but i guess she didn't
mean it because now she's saying that i
did the wrong thing basically every
penny i gave my mom was made while my
parents were letting me live with them
over 80 percent of it was made then we
opened the savings retirement account 13
years ago together when we got married
and have been putting money in there
since this is not from that okay i mean
like
it's
you're not the [ __ ] for using your
money
to
help your parents out
and you're
you're kind of an [ __ ]
i don't know it depends on how the
situation like went down right
if you talked about it
and she went yeah that sounds good you
have a great case for that it's your
money they you know you earned before we
had even met each other essentially
you're still contributing to our joint
accounts then no problem
but if if she originally went
fine
and then you did it you got to read
between the lines on that one that's
more of like an everybody sucks here but
i mean this is like a not the [ __ ]
situation i think
he did a nice thing
the reasoning for him being an [ __ ]
is that that money could have gone to
build a life like with his wife together
that's true you know money that you
spend on a could also be used on b
but at the same time like
you know this is not money that they
made together it's his money he helped
his parents out of like a serious jam it
wasn't like he bought them a a maserati
for no reason like
this this is a not the [ __ ] situation
that being said 50 say he's the [ __ ]
42 percent say not the [ __ ] i i can
understand
like why
people would think he's an [ __ ]
everyone's people were like oh his
wife's being greedy well it's not
necessarily greedy to be like you could
have put that 77 000 towards you know
like accelerating our own financial life
as a
as a couple instead you know like
investments
down payment on a house something like
that you know instead of it doesn't mean
that she was just trying to you know
blow it on something
you there's good reasons to to spend it
in a there's good reasons to spend it in
b
we'll see what the comments say
you're the [ __ ] you're married you
don't suddenly drain your savings and
drop 77k without your partner's
agreement hey hey
she said
fine
now
she could have said
that sounds fine
alternatively
[Laughter]
she could have said fine and then walked
into a different room and that changes
the
the dynamic completely
i challenge accepted exactly
and this it's a complicated one
mild you're the [ __ ] if you're
married and have a family of your own
spending your entire savings and your
parents is kind of messed up like i get
wanting to help your family but doing so
the expense of risking your your own
family security is dodgy your parents
are grown-ups they can handle their own
problems you're right they want to help
but if i was your wife i'd be pissed if
they dropped 77k to do it too
after reading other comments and
responses you're the [ __ ] big time
you have a kid and you just mortgaged
her future to keep your parents afloat
even though they have other options your
dad can be too proud all he wants but
what he should have said is use that
money for your daughter's education
instead and the only thing your mother
should have discussed about this is how
they can keep themselves above water
without taking any of your life savings
really everybody sucks here except for
your poor wife ah the plot thickens
kind of
the fact that opia as a kid isn't being
mentioned merely enough
the comment confuses me
doesn't op specifically say his
daughter's education fund was not
touched
he only touched separate money from
before they were married he changed his
story and apparently edited comments
multiple times fortunately he didn't
edit them until he got a negative
reaction so other people saw it already
yeah one point he responded to three or
four things i said at once maybe not
realizing all the ones he's replying to
were me and gave different answers in
different threads justifying it he's
been changing things every time he
responds and each clarification twisted
more and more at best he co-mingled some
money but when he got married brought
what he's calling solely into their
joint
his into their joint finances that his
wife then managed for them overall he
then created new accounts is he going to
prison
this is like a a judgment
a college fund joint retirement fund
some amalgamation of various ones where
all the money seems to be together but
the whole thing was disorganized and
mixed and now he's trying to save face
for messing up or he decided because he
contributed most money he's unilaterally
allowed to change his mind since his
wife is replaceable all of this behind
his dad's back when he didn't even have
a need for sure at the moment however he
did it results in his accountant wife
not asked for by the way realizing he
either lied or improperly communicated
things uh okay this adds so much context
that
that's too much okay they first off they
should not have this much information
about this man's life okay
however
is does it say something about me that i
feel like this guy is in way more hot
water now that i know that his wife's an
accountant
like i feel like that's like if you're
married to a cardiologist and you were
sneaking butterfingers on the side
like to be married to an accountant and
then
be like oh by the way
there's 77 000 in my savings account i
gave it to my parents like i feel like
you're
i that's why i said leave the metaphor
to me
you're the [ __ ] of course you're the
[ __ ] when you marry someone you join
together that's what marriage is big
financial decisions like this need to be
joint decisions
yeah um she said fine
no maybe she said that's a fine
like if you do that that's a fine like
i'm gonna garnish your allowance for the
next
10 years as a result of that maybe he
misinterpreted
anyway i don't know i i'm surprised i
kind of like
i'm i'm more in the middle on reddit but
i don't think i'm fully on chat's side
like it is
i mean marriage is weird right like
kind of when you are married you can
split your finances
you can have your money
our money
your spouse's money but
it's kind of like a
at least i think in north america it's
kind of like a wink and a nudge in the
eyes of the law because i'm pretty sure
all assets accrued since marriage are
de facto considered 50 50 owned by each
spouse so it's kind of like you
know we keep everything separate
in the eyes of the law if it ever came
to that you pretty much just king
solomon it but
i heard me her hurt me
[Laughter]
but i don't know how that applies to 77
000 that was accrued before
you got married but also i feel like
once you start having to have a legal
uh
discussion about this with your spouse
you're heading down a a
a strange road
like once you start to consider the
you know maybe suing your
wife or husband it's
an interesting situation but anyway um
am i the [ __ ] for asking this guy to
i'm seeing to pick up the tab since he
makes so much more than me
user was
cyber bullied for this post no question
about
it please
it's been removed
i was i was so ready man
i was so ready
i'm not i'm not gonna go to redacted
no it's okay i respect the it's the
right to be forgotten okay
redacted
i know we got like half an hour left
here i'm kind of i'm looking for some
i'm looking for some
juicy ones man
i'm looking for some juicy ones
am i the [ __ ] for making my
stepdaughter be less friendly with my
daughter not the [ __ ] i sleep
am i the [ __ ] for changing my baby's
name despite promising my dead husband's
family i'd name the child after him
jackpot
not jackpot not not not jackpot am i the
[ __ ] for getting only one of my twin
sons a phone
i have twin sons
12. let's call them bob and joe for
simplicity's sake
who are in seventh grade back when they
were at the end of fifth grade my wife
and i were planning to get them both
phones over the summer as they would be
starting sixth grade next year that's
the phone year as we know
uh unfortunately covet hit now that
they'd be home all day we saw no reason
to give them phones as they already had
cellular ipad minis and we're going to
get laptops for school
flash forward to this school year my
sons are both going to middle school
after doing sixth grade virtually they
reminded us we were going to get them
phones once their school restarted but
my wife recently lost her job and found
a much lower paying one so we were
trying to get our finances back on track
they haven't been doing so well this
year last quarter they brought home
report cards with b's c's and f's info
what were the f's in
if they were in
gym
big whoop
it was in art
big whoop short stories
how'd they do in novellas though
uh
so they're not doing so well i was a bit
disappointed told them i didn't want to
reward them with phones for a report
card like that and i would need a's or
b's for a phone they also haven't been
doing so wait that's the same i told
them i would work with them and get them
a tutor but they also needed to work too
look at this smiling baby
hello
hi
oh hello baby
how did my baby do today
uh a little bit cry oh little quite a
bit a lot oh

i'm glad she did okay at the
at the daycare you know it's a big day
for a kid
go meet some uh
some peers
be taken care of by an adult who's
essentially like a stranger to you
anyway getting back to uh yeah insulting
these parents
[Laughter]
i told them i would work with them and
get them a tutor but they also had to
work hard too
i see where they get it from
a typo not on my watch they had this
quarter to work and earn their phone
i reminded them that if one of them
ended up getting the grades required and
the other one didn't i would only be
buying a phone for the one who got the
grades over the next two weeks i began
to see major improvement from both bob
and joe however as a few more weeks went
by i could see bob slacking off my wife
and i kept trying to get him motivated
but he just didn't try
flash forward to last week and i got the
report cards back joe's been working
like a machine for the past quarter and
it really showed he got all a's not one
b bob on the other hand slipped back
into the b and c range
i was tracking their progress on my
phone throughout the quarter and during
the last week i went out and brought
bought joe's iphone 12 and kept it until
that day
i knew at this point there was no way
for bob to catch up there were no
quizzes scheduled for the week but i
went and bought a pair of air pods for
him after calling and asking my wife if
it was okay with her
what's he gonna use the airpods with his
cellular ipad mini come on man
he's he's gonna be
he's gonna be laughed at
cause you got those plugged into your
your ipod mini that doesn't have access
to
oh wait the cellular one that's the good
one right
wi-fi only is the
that's the the cheap ipad well the
cheaper ipad
also known as the one we have because
i've never seen our ipad leave our our
home um
i think i may be the ass oh hold on it's
been a week since then and bob has
barely said a word to me my wife or joe
so a week is a long time in the world of
a 12 year old
i don't want bob to feel as we chose joe
over him so i'm considering buying him
the phone to make him feel better but my
wife thinks since we give them both the
same choice it was fair i think i may be
the [ __ ] as this has driven a rift
through the family bob on one side and
the rest of us on the other so am i the
[ __ ] edit to everyone saying the
phone is out of our budget we had more
than enough to buy the phone on contract
so that part wasn't a big deal oh update
okay so this was all a joke apparently i
talked to bob and was about to start
apologizing
when
hold what he told me it was all a joke i
figured this was him just being
defensive but he seemed pretty insistent
on it i got my wife and joe in the room
and apparently this was all a stupid
joke they cooked up i don't know whether
to be mad at them or relieved that bob
at least has a bright future in acting
your wife was in on it
so you're
either your kid
said to your wife hey you know what'd be
a great prank on our dad is to make me
think i hate him in all of you
or your wife came up with it and was
like it'd be really funny if you'd
gaslight your father into thinking that
he ruined our family uh
and then she was like yeah that's a good
idea
for a week for for even for an hour
that's kind of [ __ ] up
to just play with someone's emotions
like that um
but for a week
like you you probably ruined a week of
this man's life
just
for for what
what dude you should have seen your face
it was so funny when you thought your
son would never talk to you again
it was so funny when you
you thought
that you had completely torpedoed one
twin's relationship with his other twin
over an iphone 12.
the only
look the only thing i can say here is
i
yes that maybe this is a face saving
move okay
maybe this is a situation where
the the mom talked to the kid and was
like knock that out
and the kid was like let's pretend it
was all just a laugh and we'll just
build the future of our family on a
foundation of lies
i
believe it or not that's the good
outcome here because if
it was actually
a joke
like
from the inception
you have to
send your wife to
counseling like immediately she needs to
know that that would you ever feel
secure
and trusting in your relationship ever
again knowing that at any point
your emotions could be
responsible
the only reason you're feeling these
emotions is because she wants to prank
you for like a week or more
it's just bizarre man
anyway let's assume that we're not
reading the update because i think it
was
more cut and dry then i don't know this
is like the classic
it's the the the classic parental
dilemma right
you want to incentivize your child to do
something usually something good do
better in school do your chores whatever
um you threaten a punishment if they
don't do it they don't do it now what do
you do hot shot
you know are you gonna are you gonna
stick to your principles even though you
know it's gonna upset them
maybe [ __ ] your life up for a bit uh or
are you gonna relent give them the thing
they wanted anyway and then maybe teach
them the lesson that they never have to
ever follow through on a promise because
of the fact that they
uh can just cry and then get what they
wanted you know it's it's an
uncomfortable position to be in
that's i don't i don't know
i i feel like
well here's the thing okay i hate to
become like a lawyer
i need a's and b's for a phone okay can
i get that written up like in a tort law
context there's no question joe should
get a phone if you wanted to be the
worst parent on earth you say joe sorry
i can't get you a phone because bob got
one c that is how you end up not having
a relationship with your children after
they leave home you'll never talk to
them again
it would be kind of funny if it happened
on a tv show or something like that but
in real life it's over the line
they'll hate each other for sure um
that's an ancillary though uh ancillary
sorry it's one of those words i've been
mispronouncing forever um
joe
did well deserves a phone bob it's look
i
i don't know where i would come down on
this one i was gonna say can you get bob
like a like a like an lg chocolate or
something like that
uh
and then put parental controls on it so
like all he can use it for is to like
phone home
and
like i kind of feel like
maybe this is not a popular opinion or
maybe it is but i feel like
you want your kid to have a cell phone
that you don't want them to necessarily
have access to like you know robin hood
but you want your kid to be able to
phone you if they get into trouble or i
don't know phone the police or something
like that phone their school
um yeah you want your kid to have at
least some kind of
connectivity right um
so
i think you gotta give him
i think you gotta give him an lg
chocolate man i think it's the only the
only way
and then if he gets one
one quarter
of a better performance on his report
card then you can upgrade him to that
you can upgrade him to the iphone 12
iphone 12 rose gold plus with a 4k
screen
and the airpod pros
i don't like being this guy okay because
like
it takes something like this to get me
to be this guy
but you can't
be
it it harms your
case to be like we had money problems so
he didn't get him phones
my son didn't fulfill his end of the
bargain so instead of getting them an
iphone 12 i got them airpods
it's just
i'm not telling them they can't spend
their money like that and clearly their
financial situation has changed over the
course of the past year i'm just saying
it you could get cheaper
i'm not saying airpods are bad or
they're not worth it but he's a 12 year
old kid do you know how many airpods i
would have lost at age 12
they don't have cords
they don't
i'd they'd be dropping out of my ears
all the time man you're chewing gum
jaw muscle pops an air pot out goes
right down the sewer grate you go
i want my air puff back all of a sudden
you know you're getting abducted by
pennywise the clown
i guess they could just buy more
gripsy
okay okay
we all drip down here bob
wicked by the way wicked yeah babe
wicked mouth yeah bib
am i the [ __ ] for taking my
girlfriend home early from a party
hold on i'm just
just looking
just looking really wristers
holy crap
you want to know like as you get older
why you're like less interested in going
out to parties and getting hammered
thursday night at 8 30 a text rolls in
hey you want to come over tomorrow it's
going to be fun
saturday morning 11 a.m
holy birch
and then i can't believe that she would
and then i was said and then i do i just
wanted to take a seat on the couch oh
but just because you've had 17 mcclay's
all of a sudden i can't sit on the couch
you want to [ __ ] fight with me what's
your problem and then i wanted to eat
the last slice of pizza but i couldn't
eat all that size of pizza because the
fridge was getting blocked by people
standing next to the keg all night and
remember i heard it heard me or heard me
okay this might be our last one let's go
let's go hey reddit what's going on
what's going on hey guys what's going on
i'm in a little bit of a jam not click
bait so a few nights ago me 22f 22m and
my partner 19f went to my school
friend's house for a party we've been
dating for two weeks and have known each
other for about six months
there i
everybody chill
but i think there should be a rule you
can't
bring your relationship problem to
reddit
when you've been dating for two weeks
it's just not enough
like you you need to
at least cross
i'm going to say three months then you
reach a point where like
the government has figured out that this
is not an anti-money laundering
situation like you're an actual couple
now we can start to work from the
position that you guys are building
something together not just like i mean
that two two weeks ago
that that was like
i don't even know that was like
thanksgiving
canadian thanksgiving sorry sorry so so
you've been boyfriend and girlfriend for
two social occasions now uh her her
father has been a little suspect of me
as i am three years older which i
totally understand because it played on
my mind too before i asked her out but
she's just amazing in all ways and i
can't imagine myself with somebody else
look i'm getting too into this
i bet it's not always she's 19 years old
you're telling me she can parallel park
on a busy downtown street at rush hour
she's amazing in all ways she's 19.
you ever see her do her taxes
i'm just i'm just saying
anyway the other just don't lie that's
all i'm asking okay just don't lie
anyway the other night i took her to my
mate's place for a party as i wanted to
introduce her to all my school friends
she checked with her old man and he said
yes as long as she's back by 10 pm
another consideration is that she
doesn't drive well
well well
what did i tell you
i can spot him a mile away
i said yep no problem and she agreed too
on the way to the party she tells me
just ignore her dad have a few drinks
and then drive me home in the morning
i protested and said no i want to earn
her old man's trust
and show him respect
you know
maybe start just calling him her dad
instead of old man every time would be
nice um
this hurt as i wanted nothing more than
to spend the night together but felt it
was right on the way to the party she'd
okay yeah so 9 30 rolls around i say to
her let's go i don't want to be late i
then turn to a maid and say leave that
whiskey for me i got some catching up to
do when i get back
she
20 22 year olds uh
version of what being a classy older
gentleman is like
save that whisk in in their head save
that whiskey for me i'll have some
catching up to do when i get back
me observing it as a 32 year old save
that whiskey for me i'll have some
catching up to do when i get back
she protests saying she's having a
really good time she doesn't want to go
keep it civil and eventually she agrees
and we leave in the car i explain to her
my stance and reinforce how much i don't
want to do this she's just quiet when i
get back to her place and open the door
her father answers and says thank you
and what you've done means a lot i say
too easy and accept his handshake
she said dude too easy that's so by the
way i'm on this guy's side right now
it's just really funny
too easy
yeah too easy why don't you make it 7
p.m next time and then i swear to god
her old man turned to me and said
challenge accepted
my partner is still annoyed hinting that
she thinks this isn't going to work i
don't want this to be over she is
amazing in every way
maybe not behind the wheel and i
understand that what i did was sexist as
i was putting the wants of her the
father over her
and i do not want him to stop me from
seeing her as he didn't trust me so read
it am i the [ __ ] not sexist i think
i would not go that far
sexism is not when you have a
disagreement with your partner who is a
woman
just a quick edit wow cheers for your
input
also one thing i want to add oh cheers
for all your input guys
little sexist
now
now you're losing me jeff probst however
you are on reddit
so statistically speaking this is
probably largely accurate
as a result i'm going to say
we're moving on i also want to add i
made it clear when we're discussing this
this was only a one maybe two time
things i want her dad to trust me not
worry about his daughter when we're out
together
and she didn't get shouted out when we
got home so that we can spend more
nights out together this will not be
occurring in the future
and i did not get any joy whatsoever
from doing this it's the polar opposite
of what i personally wanted to do
duh
i just did what i felt was right so we
can continue seeing each other all's
good in the world just got off the phone
from her and her old man her old man
again thanked me then told me he will no
longer be imposing any restrictions to
us going out yay and that apologized for
putting me in a hard situation he was
just very wary of the age gap he then
left the room or at least i hope he did
ha ha
this is all just very normal right now
like this is not that
it's not that crazy
the better half you okay look man
you've been dating for two weeks
you can't be calling her your better
half already that's like uh
that's like a married for five years
sort of thing maybe like 25 years
the better half then popped on
said she understood my reasoning and
that he her dad told her after i dropped
her off i didn't bring her back he would
have forced her to break up with me
after reflection for the post here i
apologize for heading back to the party
where she responded with why shouldn't
you enjoy yourself because my dad's a
downer what an [ __ ] man
can you bring my 19 year old daughter
back by 10
then also like such a disciplinarian he
then called me back and said sorry for
putting you in a tough spot
i was just concerned about my child
[ __ ] [ __ ] yes sir sir yes sir
i'll have your daughter back by 10 p.m
so yeah
we then had a laugh and made plans for
tonight no curfew in sight edit number
three
thanks guys for your input we broke up
however i've seen a few people placing
my girlfriend into an [ __ ] category
which i think is a little unfair hey you
guys thanks for your input
thanks for all your support guys
but listen
some of you
been calling my better half an [ __ ]
i'm more than happy to accept i was
somewhat of an ass
and so was the father yeah in absolutely
no way whatsoever
really were either of you the [ __ ] at
all maybe you shouldn't have gone back
to the party but i think you probably
should have
but like
no you didn't neither no one involved
really did anything wrong at all however
my girlfriend
is an awesome kind person who just
wanted to spend time with me in no way
would she want to cause an argument with
her old man over this because she
doesn't like conflict
she's just one of those people that
doesn't like conflict you know she's
drama free she's my better half
she's good at everything except parking
please be understanding that she is from
a strict household
so yes sir sir
which makes it incredibly tough to stand
up for herself she is no
[ __ ] sir
i will defend her honor as is necessary
it all worked out fine look at all this
is like emblematic of so much young
adult drama and i you know i had my own
dose of it for sure it was like all this
[ __ ] look at this look at the wasted
time
dozens of man hours like reading
comments
replying comments like just sapping the
productivity of the reddit using world
and then it's like we had a conversation
on the phone everything's fine the end
you know sorry i wrote two essays like
it's just
it's just okay man it's not there's no
problem
anyway that's react cord for this week

unfortunately this one has been deleted
am i the [ __ ] for being hurt after my
friend said i helped her come out as gay
and then removed and also given the
[ __ ] tag but i try to respect other
people finally at this point in my life
i i don't see the need to um
you know go into the the deep web to
dunk on them further it is what it is i
should have been here earlier but it
happens
how about this this one's kind of
driving me crazy man when i saw this one
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to open
the car door for my the door for my
husband and forcing him to spend the
night in the garage
that seems bad
and she's not the [ __ ] somehow
i mean i i kind of feel like she
we got to find out how my husband
recently
female 29 male husband 33 it checks out
okay hey
everybody call off the dogs
for
six weeks
this is going to be the age difference
between myself and my wife
between november and january
of this year so i don't want to hear any
monkey staged uh difference
you pieces
he's been feeling upset ever since oh
sorry he got relevant detail he got
kicked out of his job
and decided to sue his former boss for
misjudgment he's been feeling upset ever
since he really worked hard to get his
position
and seeing years of work go to waste was
devastating for him
his friends have been taking him out to
cheer him up and let off some steam the
problem is that he'd be gone for hours
and show up
late at night drunk he did it two times
this week he came home at 2am while
drunk and made noise because he expected
me to open the door for him while i was
asleep i couldn't wait for him and stay
up late because unlike him i have work
and other responsibilities
sounds like maybe there's a little bit
of resentment involved
unlike him i have work look that's like
an insult but it's true like it at least
that hits
other responsibilities that hurts that's
that's an unnecessary
motivated by anger comment to put at the
end there just to make him seem like a
loser which
let's read further um
when he complained about how i should be
quick to open the door for him i told
him next time he comes home late at 2
a.m and
up then i won't be opening the door for
him period
he said he won't stay out late again and
that my challenge was accepted did he
really say challenge accepted
because if this is the case you are not
the [ __ ] for making him sleep in the
garage
did he do the challenge accepted
anyway
last night when he went out with his
buddy he dropped him off at outside at 2
30 a.m i was awake at the time when my
husband kept ringing the bell and then
knocking on the door i remained in bed
and refused to open the door he called
my phone telling me he was outside and i
needed to open up i asked him to tell me
what time it was and he said it's 7 30
it's still early come on open up the
door
one of the most brazen lies you will
ever hear in your entire life
to just
[Laughter]
look if you got the persuasion 100 to
get that off more power to you but
that's that's like the most
uh verifiably false lie you could ever
you couldn't have just said like it's 11
30 like you had to pick a time when
maybe the sun is still up
um he kept calling over and over and
then knocked several times then he
stopped turns out he slept in the garage
on the floor he had a huge argument with
me calling me petty and ridiculous for
keeping him out of his house and
refusing to open the door for him i
reminded him that i didn't have to stay
up every week to wait for him and open
the door for him he said he forgot his
key and i was clearly trying to prove a
point here but he said it's his house i
should never keep him out of it like
that he told me to apologize and say
i'll never do it again
but i walked out the kitchen i walked
out the kitchen while he was talking
which pissed him off more than he said
he was going through rough times and i
was making it worse and being
unsupportive okay
i am going to say
based there's no edits here which i
respect
for me
this is a big everybody sucks here
let's go over the the facts and and my
interpretation of the case okay
the husband sucks there's no doubt he is
an [ __ ] in this situation
um
whether he's going through a tough time
or not he uh
you know who cares if you go out and you
get uh
drunk with your friends if you come in
yourself
uh phrasing if you open the door
yourself and have the means to you know
sleep on the couch or whatever and not
be as disruptive as you were then you
know that's a you can still be
frustrated but that's a different story
you know
but to constantly be coming back and
then um not being able to enter the
house your wife has to open the door
you're waking her up at 2 a.m just
because you you know are irresponsible
that's rude and
you promised you wouldn't do it again
and then you did it again that makes you
either the [ __ ] for promising without
having the intention to follow through
or alternatively
um
for having the intention but making no
preparation whatsoever this is an
[ __ ] move
now can i tell you i don't actually
think
that he is the [ __ ]
for being mad that she didn't open the
door
i feel like you as a spouse
you have like an obligation to um
help your spouse out in a situation like
that where they don't go
they don't have the means to get into
the house like
i i even if
like i'm i'm putting myself in like a
you know in their shoes right
we kate and i have had sleep schedule
differences prior to the baby you know
sometimes like i would go to bed at like
midnight and she would be doing some
like savage type rate and final fantasy
that went on a little later um so i can
relate to the the sleep schedule
difference and you know
being like why are you making such you
know clackity-clackity in the other room
while i'm trying to sleep however
um
you know if if she was like hey i really
need your help right now sorry to wake
you up and it was like an emergency on
this level you got to just bite the
bullet you have like a crappy sleep and
then the next day you have the moral
high ground
and you you just come over the top in
the argument and win easily and then
you know make make your point much more
known
you have to like
make them feel bad about it and then
hopefully it modifies their behavior and
if it doesn't you can go from there i
will see you know what i do agree with
what chad's saying though that
a a 33 year old man
for getting the key to his own home
enough that he has to wake up his wife
at 2 am is mega cringe energy
like i i i just don't understand do you
not do the do you not do the the
the pants
do you not do the the
the three pocket pad like every five
minutes you're outside
you got a triple tap you got a wallet
you got your phone you got your keys it
took me a while because i grew up in a
pre-cell phone era and i didn't carry my
keys around you know when i was a little
kid right so i just had a little wallet
tap until i was like 14 15 years old and
now you got the key tap as well and then
you get a phone tap in there too and
it's just like how do you not have your
keys
how do you not have your i just don't
understand
i do it five times a day i'm gonna be i
i probably do it
i wouldn't be so if on a weekend day
where i've been walking around maybe
we're out a little bit i wouldn't be
surprised if i did it 20 times a day
easily and you know you do the tap
not just to make sure that it's there
but because you know when you go into
like a bathroom and you can see the
schedule of when the bathroom has been
cleaned it's like that
because you can not only are you like oh
my wallet's missing or something now you
go back into the ledger and you're like
the last time i did the tap my wallet
was there i was at best buy so i have
lost my wallet somewhere between best
buy and the next tap which was 35
seconds later so then you just mentally
like map the 35 seconds that have passed
and you're like oh i left it on the
counter when i paid for my cell phone
case or something
you just you're just you're tapping
non-stop it's it's these are important
data points okay
anyway
a a grown man for getting his keys this
much or getting so intoxicated he can't
maintain the position of his keys is is
mega cringe
that's that's my
uh that's my philosophy here so but i
still think it's everybody sucks here
you know you're married to the guy you
can't just lock him out of the house
that's like a divorceable moment
like no
no jury on earth would be like you know
based
i think they would be like you really
let made your husband sleep in the
garage
when you had already woken up to tell
him you won't open the door like
it's one of those things where it's like
you were so morally in the right
all you had to do was do the right thing
the ethical thing
and then everyone would be on your side
instead you went i have cause to be
upset so i'm gonna like hit you with
mjolnir
and now everybody's like 50 50. so i am
i'm a little surprised honestly
that that we have 64 not the [ __ ] and
only 22
everybody sucks here um
i i would have thought there'd be more
everybody sucks here honestly but the
only thing i will say is like one of the
things that on the internet is most
despisable by the plurality is uh
breaking a promise or being inconsistent
in any way with what you said you would
do
like if you said you would murder
somebody and then you didn't it would
still be like 50 50. people would be
like on the one hand it's good he didn't
commit a murder but on the other hand he
promised so
you know it's a bit of a gray area
people are they put a lot of value on
never having any level of cognitive
dissonance which i think is a little bit
unrealistic but anyway
um
let me see
here
he's a grown-ass man with a key stop
opening up for him
until he learns to take responsibility
for himself and remembers his key not
the [ __ ] see like this i agree
for sure i think there's a little
there's a step further you know which is
like
she still should have opened up the door
for him
he's sleeping on the garage floor i
don't know where they live right but
he's sleeping on the garage floor in
october
that's it's been like six degrees here
lately
like that would be
that would we would wake up like
insanely cold
tomorrow you doing okay back there
honestly i thought you would be but not
the [ __ ] he said
challenge accepted
he said challenge accepted and didn't
take his key that's on him he said the
the the words of power
not the [ __ ] but you're a husband
your husband appears to be in a bad way
after his job loss yes
for sure also how do adults not have
keys to their own homes i'm getting i'm
getting mired in the minutia here a
little bit but this is what bothers me
the most like you ever think that this
is like
um
this is a solution where you could just
go to the dollar store and for like 1.99
you could just get like a like a key
ring or something you could even attach
it to your belt or something man it's
not that stylish but it's better than
sleeping on the garage floor
it sounds like he needs counseling
pronto before he develops alcoholism
look
it's you can't say that from
this data point it's like he's well he
was out like two times this week that's
i mean it's
by the way how did he get home was he
riding in a car with a drunk driver did
i ever tell you the story about how like
this this [ __ ] pisses me off okay cause
it's like it is safe
but it's like such a high degree of like
assumed
guilt that it annoys me but this story
of i was at a house party uh after
it was like spring break of my first
year of college
and uh when you got there you had to
pull your car keys in like a
you know the cabinet or something so
that you didn't take your car and drive
home drunk which was not a risk to begin
with but anyway
i uh got drunk at the party
then i started to feel mighty ill i was
18 years old right i was starting to
feel mighty ill and i was trying to
because other people were coming down
with a little illness as well it seemed
like there might be something going
around
i was trying to like solicit a ride to
get home and my friend's mom who
happened to be there was like sure i'll
drive you home but to get keys
from the the person that was manning the
key cabinet i had to go through like the
[ __ ] third degree they were like i'm
not gonna give you your keys you're
you're drunk and i'm like i know i'm
drunk i'm getting a ride home i need my
keys to get into my house and they're
like i don't trust you you could just be
lying to me to get your keys so you can
drive drunk and then i was like my
friend's mom
the host mom
is like in her pajamas right now she's
downstairs do you think this is like
part of this elaborate ruse i just need
you to give me the keys to my own house
it took like you know 15 minutes of of
trying to convince them honestly good
friend not not at all
i just needed i needed my own house keys
not a not a good friend in the slightest
they they live in a world of delusional
fear
where they think you know people are
constantly doing like a conspiracy to
like you know jokes on them now i'm
gonna die
anyway i don't know she was just she was
i think she just got a little taste of
power and then she was like
this feels good
bow down you want your own house keys
back go [ __ ] yourself
i think that's she she can't be trusted
in a position of authority
i wasn't bald back then she wasn't
intimidated by my scalp okay
anyways and apparently now she posts on
reddit by the way how did he get home
was he riding in a car with a drunk
driver probably he should be in prison
maybe for life um
not the [ __ ] can we get somebody
that's like you know i just want the
slightest degree of dissent here hi so
i've done this but on purpose with a
deadbolt i left a pillow and blanket on
the stoop through the deadbolt and went
to bed at 3am three hours after he said
he was getting in an uber right now and
then stopped responding
look
that's
actually i can relate
that's annoying i would be annoyed as
hell
if kate was like i'm getting in an uber
and then three hours later she still was
not home
but you can't
look i'm gonna be the stereo i'm gonna
be the classic example
like
if a wife did this to her husband people
are like that's an episode of everybody
loves raymond if a husband did it to his
wife it's an episode of a new television
program called the worst husbands on

[Laughter]
you can't always get reverse the roles
to
to to come up with a point but
definitely like
if a wife locking her husband out
culturally is kind of like well he did
he made a mistake and you know
hahaha i had to sleep on the stoop last
night you know how it is
if you're like i was i locked my wife
outside last night
because she didn't come home by 2 a.m
you would be people would be like
you are
[ __ ] crazy you are insane
now i'm not saying that's right i'm just
saying you locked your wife outside of
the house
are you crazy
anyway
um
mine was distraught and embarrassed
begged me to never do it again part of
the reason i did it i was so furious i
would have blown up when he did arrive
and he'd have remembered none of it our
solution was that next time i'd just
leave instead
so i get a nice trip to a hotel he gets
to come home to a cold bed and sit and
wonder if i'm ever coming back hasn't
happened yet as we've worked on the
reason he blacks out instead okay so
there it it's a nice ending at least
that they that it's never happened since
but
that's the kind of ultimatum that that's
that's a bit troubling um
anyway
hey everyone stopping by to be negative
please include stories of your superior
coping skills with the alcoholic in your
immediate family okay thanks
so it's so
just so combative at all times
you know it just annoys me it's
combative
when they're replying to like just the
op like it's not like they're replying
to somebody who said like hey you know
you're an idiot they're just like
apropos of nothing at all they're well i
guess they're replying to the people who
are in their dms so fair enough
info why was your husband fired they
accused him of bribery and tampering
with work files which he never did his
former boss said he could get him in
huge legal trouble but decided to just
let him go since he was one of the best
workers at the company
my husband then filed a report and
decided to sue his former boss for
accusing him of something he didn't do
and threatening legal actions that seems
just like your classic little
your classic situation
that old song and dance the you you
bribed and tampered with work files but
you're such a good employee that instead
of getting the law involved i'm just
gonna fire you and then you're gonna sue
me for accusing me of something i didn't
do okay sure
everybody sucks here okay yeah yeah yeah
he sounds like he has a drinking problem
and obviously he should bring his key
with him but you were awake and should
have just let him in and had a serious
adult conversation with him about it you
were being petty
that's phineas finally i after
well not that much scrolling but still
plus it was only 7 30.
hold on where was here we go
she's already done that he keeps doing
it so the solution is to be petty
setting a specific boundary and sticking
to it is not petty if she opens the door
he knows he can just keep doing it tell
me you look at human beings like you're
training a dog without telling me you
look at human beings like you're
training a dog how many times until it's
not petty in your eyes his actions are
passive aggressive and juvenile see i
can throw around buzzwords too i love
this [ __ ] man
i i absolutely love this [ __ ]
apparently by the way petty is a
buzzword i don't know if you've been
watching the
the merriam-webster power rankings
lately
but it's been rising the charts it's
been going crazy
sticking to a specific completely
ridiculous boundary is dumb if the
boundary is petty to begin with it isn't
worth enforcing there are much better
ways to handle this minus seven i mean i
kind of agree with some of the down
votes like i don't know if it's a
ridiculous boundary
minus seven is maybe a little much
i love they keep bringing up challenge
accepted
after saying challenge accepted he does
it again two days later and there's no
way you can convince me this was
accidental
the source of a true logician this was a
power play plain and simple he really
didn't believe she would enforce a
boundary she did hey husband is me op
i'm really worried about your drinking
and think you need to stop
or seek help in quitting i can't and
won't live like this anymore i really
need to see you trying here i'm not sure
if i can keep this relationship going
with you anymore even though i love you
the adult boundary oh
man
get me out of there anyway
moving on um
i think that's that's a big everybody
sucks there
am i the [ __ ] so many not the
[ __ ] here congrats or sorry that
happened to you or whatever
am i the [ __ ] for shutting down my
daughter's business
my daughter's school doesn't offer an
online copy of most textbooks and their
textbooks are heavy so whenever a class
starts a new chapter she scans the
chapter in the textbook onto her tablet
uses the tablet in class people started
asking her for copies so she charges
five dollars per chapter she has
approximately 100 clients and makes
around 600 and 900 dollars a month holy
burst
[Laughter]
oh my god
yo okay so i gotta be careful here
um
because i mean this is illegal but she's
also a minor which means nothing's uh
illegal for her right
unless she kills someone in cold blood
she's like she's got complete immunity
to all legal proceedings what are they
gonna do put her in juvenile hall
for the the the crime of textbook
scanning
i don't think so
i think she can get away with it quite
frankly plus the other thing i wanted
the parents might go to jail they can't
do that the sins of the the sins of the
father passed to the sins of the the sun
the that's into the sun don't pass to
the father it's a one-way transition
it's like rna polymerase
now
the other thing i want to say is
stealing is bad but the textbook
cartel um
honestly couldn't happen to like uh
a nicer industry
changing six words in your textbook uh
releasing it as a new addition charging
fifty dollars more uh
if you sell your book back to the campus
bookstore they give you 35 cents and
then they sell it as a used book that's
ten dollars cheaper than the new version
of the book
it's it's uh
it's a scam man it's a scam so i'm not
saying i support this
but i am saying it's not like she's
stealing onions from the soup kitchen
you know she's
she's putting a little dent in mcgraw
hill okay
that that's all i'm saying now let
people start okay she's making 600 and
900 bucks a month
many people would say good for her i'm
not saying this is me saying good for
her i'm just saying many people would
say good for her very creative
i didn't know she was doing this until i
saw that she was making a lot of large
purchases new ipad phone and macbook
nice clothes doordashing food at least
once a week
and when i asked how she got the money
she told me i told her that taking money
from her classmates isn't okay
and told her to shut it down and she
threw a tantrum because it's easy money
and because her dad is fine with it okay
here's the thing all right
it there is a seed of wrongness in here
and the wrongness is that it's not her
property
to distribute for money
that's that's the seed of wrongness
whether you believe that the wrongness
overtakes the baseness okay
the reason it's it would be wrong is not
because taking money from her classmates
isn't okay this is
the foundation
of
society
in almost every country across planet
earth
it's it's commerce you know it's it's
business
you know if you run a coffee shop you're
taking money from your customers
you're providing them a service or a
product in exchange for it what do you
mean it's not okay to take money from
her classmates
so some dude who just puts a bunch of
oregano in ziploc bags is able to do it
but but helping kids study better is not
uh
it doesn't warrant a financial
compensation
i i
is i can't remember this is the the dad
or the mom we don't know yet oh
okay i like maybe the mom but either way
i think she doesn't fully understand
that
uh
how the world works but maybe that's a
thing to say um she's staying with my ex
and won't talk to me so i want to know
if i was the [ __ ] okay so i have to
come down after being very non-committal
i have to come down here at some point
i
believe it or not
actually think she's not the [ __ ]
but i don't think
it's because
well i would yeah you know what i'll
take it a step further i would say no
[ __ ] i forgot that you can get a no
[ __ ] ranking as well
i would say that she's not the [ __ ]
but not for the reasons that she put out
here like i don't think she's a good
person
in this situation
for
stopping her from getting money from her
classmates because it seems like she's
providing a great service i mean like
five bucks a chapter is that's a lot
she's kind of positioning herself as
like the new mcgraw-hill i suppose but
you know
either way i i do understand that uh
you know she she thinks that's the
problem for me the actual problem if i
put myself in her shoes is that
the odds of her facing a problem for
this
are probably somewhat low but it is
certainly
if not outright illegal which it might
be
um
something that she could face some
serious reprimanding for
uh
which
as a parent would would make me want to
shut it down probably as well especially
because like like in a way i'd be proud
of her for the having an entrepreneurial
spirit
but
i would also be like
this could [ __ ] your whole life up like
right before college maybe or
or maybe not but
i don't know like i feel like if you
could
not get into college because you didn't
join like the debate club in ninth grade
you also could be like
you know hurt your chances by running an
illegal textbook piracy ring or maybe
alternatively
the wharton school of business would be
like oh hell yeah
we're going to put you in our fast track
ceo mentorship program i'm not sure
um but as a parent
i i mean
look this this is just my model for
parenting at least um
your role as like a high school student
from 9th grade to 12th grade let my role
as a parent feed you mentor you provide
a safe place
for you to sleep in eat a sounding board
for you to run the problems by me as you
transition from you know childhood to
adulthood and having more
responsibilities etc etc your
responsibility in high school is like
just don't [ __ ] up so bad
that's it like
just just go to school
come home
socialize a little bit but not in like a
deleterious way that you take it too far
that's what college is for just you know
do your time get out and then out of
sight out of mind to some extent so
i think they are breaching the terms of
the agreement right here
by running an illegal textbook piracy
ring
[Laughter]
if i was
17 and i was their friend i would be
like that's based
i would also be like give me all the
textbooks for free or i'm gonna report
you to mcgraw-hill
because
you're dealing with
machiavelli you know you gotta you gotta
have some daggers of your own quite
frankly
you know otherwise you if you don't have
some kind of leverage over them
they're going to take you for everything
your work you're worth you know for it's
maybe it's five bucks a chapter in
september but then the midterms are
coming up oh sorry surge pricing now
it's 25 bucks a chapter
i anyway this is a a very like
even split
i just look and i i understand there's
room for differences of opinion right
i just can't imagine
adults writing this and being like
maybe maybe they think that the mom's
the [ __ ] for another reason like the
way she handled it but i can't imagine
being like 30 years old and being like
you should have respected your
daughter's hustle and let her
run an illegal textbook piracy ring uh
in the
in her senior year of high school
then again i'm surprised a lot so
let's see
isn't it illegal yes it's quick money
but so is theft okay yeah the true maybe
sort of not the [ __ ] applaud her
entrepreneurial spirit she saw a need
and found a way to fill it
uh and make money that's awesome point
out she's committing a crime and her and
her parents can be held legally legal
and financially responsible uh offer to
help her find legal ways to start her
own business
look number number c
number three
great piece of advice but
i did you know what this is this is on
shark tank
this is not a business this is a product
she doesn't have a business and for that
reason i'm out
what are you going to do have her open
up her own college bookstore like
it she she doesn't have it's not
scalable
you're going to buy her like a sick
scanner or something like that i don't
understand anyway um
not the [ __ ] but not for your
reasoning there's nothing wrong with
making money off your classmates if
she's offering a valuable service
they're paying for convenience but she
is breaking the law look at dude this is
like a new record
we are like that we found
my exact take
like three comments in and the first two
were not horrible either the first two
were pretty reasonable
comment deleted by user
what she's doing is illegal
you're the [ __ ] for your reasoning
yeah okay like everybody seems to be on
like the same page here
more power to you
would i be the [ __ ] if i didn't
actually read my students short story
i love a teaching
am i the [ __ ]
oh no
okay get ready
sorry for the throwaway but i feel like
this might be a tad unprofessional to
ask so out of an overabundance of
caution i don't want this attached to my
main account
oh hold on hold on i just realized i got
a i i have an urgent message to send
because i forgot how uh time zones work
okay
not not for the people that i'm working
with for back for blood but i hold on i
i thought that i started an hour early
okay sorry we are running it
one to two i forgot what time it
is today there we go okay
see no problem no problem the docket
doesn't change i just needed to send a
message up the up the chain
um
back to reddit court
anyways on tuesday i assigned a creative
writing assignment for my students for
context they're 11th graders they had
wednesday to work on it then a four day
long weekend to finish or edit it to be
submitted on monday okay
now i [ __ ] up at two vertices you sure
you're not a math teacher i'm teaching
four classes this semester and i
assigned it to all four on the same day
so on monday i received about 90 short
stories to read in grade i set a minimum
of one page but did not set a maximum
word count that's tough that's
that is bad
i miss the part where that's my problem
i've been blowing through them at a rate
of 15 a day shortest to longest but it's
going to be much harder to keep this
pace up now the last nine are at least 4
500 words long but still it's doable but
i swear to god one of my students wrote
me a novella i ran it through a word
counter and this thing is 22 000 words
long he did this in five days i am so
tempted to just read the first chapter
or two and give him 105 on the
assignment but would i be the [ __ ] if
i did that i mean he put in all that
work but sweet jesus
would it even harm him if i didn't would
it just straight up be unprofessional
and it's a sci-fi story literally my
most hated genre i can read a short
story but i don't want to read a whole
ass novella do i have to next time the
cap is ten thousand words five thousand
if it's sci-fi
i like that very clever
very clever
she you know the teacher here they're
writing in a very tight it's you can
tell
this is like one of the one percent of
people on the internet that are able to
make a complete sentence that makes
coherent sense and also conjures a
certain emotion in the people that are
reading it well played you're already
anti you are the [ __ ] points for that
you're you're you're starting from ahead
of the curve so ethically speaking do i
have to read it edit for some extra
context he asked for an extension on
monday so he could just have time to
polish it i told him i wouldn't subtract
marks from him if it's a little rough he
can just edit it on his own time
straight up
not the [ __ ]
no no [ __ ] here like come on
absolutely not
that the kid is not an [ __ ] if you
don't
you it happens sometimes you give
someone a creative piece of work
sometimes they just got nothing to do
on that weekend you know they might go
hard they might be like this is my
chance to really sink my teeth into this
um
you
22 000 words is 44 pages single spaced
and that's 44 pages in a word processor
right
like that's not 44 pages of like a
paperback novel you would keep in your
bathroom that's 44 single space paces
pages in microsoft word
so from a book context that could be
a hundred pages or something like that
um
or longer
yeah don't don't read that that's crazy
i i know okay because it it's the
internet logic
as well
um it's 100 to 130 pages holy crap
um
the internet logic is like well you made
the mistake by not uh putting a maximum
cap on it as a result you're like
morally obligated uh to to read it um
nah
i mean like you're morally incentivized
to read it but like
surely everyone agrees that there is a
bound at some point where like the logic
falls apart like if somebody wrote a 700
page
novel
should she be compelled to read it i
think at some point you just got to be
like i'm just going to give you an a
plus plus and move on
if it was a short story then the child
should fail well
the problem with that is as a teacher if
you failed the kid for
a structural reason such as that you
open yourself up to
uh
scrutiny
what i think you want to do is give them
such a good mark because they're they're
probably insanely proud of
what they wrote so you just give them
something that lines up with their
expectations and you go
you write wow a plus plus
i can see you put a lot of work into
this great job keep it up and then
you know i mean here's the thing what if
they if they if they filled 50 pages in
the middle with just like asdf asdf asdf
what are they going to do
are they going to go
um
to the principal and be like the teacher
didn't read this and blow up their a
plus or are they just going to take
their a plus plus and use that to
bolster their gpa
i don't think they
i don't think he's just i i don't i
don't think they're the [ __ ] at all
that's that's it
if he does it he's a legend
honestly i don't even think the
principal would reprimand the teacher
for that
i mean come on like just i i taught
classes in esl okay
my i'd have a class of 12 which was
small
uh and the assignment would be like
write a recipe and the recipe would be
like two paragraphs and every single one
was was how to make instant ramen and
they were all like and check this [ __ ]
out i crack an egg in it whoa and i was
like yeah so does everybody else in the
class okay that is easy in 45 minutes
you could read 12 of those
b plus a a a b plus you know blah blah
blah um
but when i think back to like my
you know like
even my middle school career they're
teaching a class of 30 kids 32 kids
they got to read 32 shitty sixth grade
essays about like whether or not school
uniforms should be
allowed or disallowed do you really
think that they're
pouring their heart and soul into
reading every single word and
it's ridiculous it's just
i mean it takes them 10 minutes
to do each essay that's reading
you know that's three hours
that's five hours
of uh of reading the same shitty essay
over i'm not saying they don't read the
essays i'm just saying they don't go
over them all with like a fine-toothed
comb you know they they
read them in a broad sense man why would
they become teachers then the same
reason like 80 of people become teachers
you know the guidance counselor in 12th
grade asked what do you want to do with
your life you spent your whole [ __ ]
life in school so far and you're like i
don't mind school maybe i'll just be a
teacher and then you go to school to
become a teacher because it's like a
stable job with a pension and you would
have a familiarity with the environment
and there's always a demand for lots of
them you know that's the whole
that's why you don't know nobody becomes
a teacher because they're like i love
reading shitty essays oh i just love
reading i love listening to fourth
graders give five-minute speeches about
adventure time
come on you know do you think they
wouldn't want to like be the taster at
the willy wonka's chocolate factory if
they had a choice they're filling a
societal need and it comes with
some employment benefits as well
yeah
also teaching is rewarding grading
it depends what you're grading but you
know grading is not fun
i can't and i was only doing like you
know 15
essays a week or something like that i
can't imagine if you're like
a high school teacher who teaches like
four periods of english a day
that's a lot man i'm just saying you
have my sympathy
long story short
not the [ __ ] but i i've i've gotta
read some of these
you are the [ __ ] oh man
oh
man
not cynical at all kappa it's not that
i mean i think it's just it's not meant
to be cynical it's naive if you think
like your essays in fifth grade were
like making your teacher's life better
she just wants to go home
you know have a glass of white wine put
on everybody loves raymond and like
knock this [ __ ] out before the next day
where she's gotta spend
all day in a in a portable outside
classroom made of like a retrofitted
shipping container in the middle of
[ __ ] june shits pure aluminum siding
on all sides
just baking in the sun like a solar
cooker
and her company is 30 5th graders who
have no respect for her whatsoever and
then like one kid who's like you're my
new surrogate mom
like you just they're the teacher is not
just a teacher right like they're a
human being
that has their own life that exists
outside of
work as well they don't exclusively
exist in order to you know make sure you
know how to spell like commitment or
something like that
anyway let's see let's let's read some
of the comments here
first of all this is hilarious second of
all you didn't specify a short story
your student wrote a novella
i'd say not the [ __ ] if you read a
chapter or two and graded it a hundred
percent if on the off chance your
student asked for feedback be honest you
had 90 stories to grade and didn't have
time to read the whole thing then say
something good about what you did read
teachers are human too boom easy
no problem
even less complicated and more honest
read part of the story if the quality is
good enough to warrant full credit award
full credit then actually say i didn't
read the whole thing but the part i did
read was already enough look
this is the this is not bad this is an
ethical and moral thing to do however
have you ever heard of the expression no
good deed goes unpunished this kid spent
a whole long weekend
probably part of the motivation for them
to write the story was they're gonna oh
man i wonder what they're gonna think of
when you know the cylons attack the
harpsichord gate or something like that
um
i don't think you need to provide this
information unless it's asked
uh
you you can withhold a little bit of
information or something like that you
don't you don't have to send it all
you know right
right out of the the the starting blocks
yes you're the [ __ ] oh here we go
long does not necessarily mean good it
could mean drawn out lacking focus a
variety of other problems or it could be
plain mediocre in fact the assessment
was short stories i'd be saying he
didn't meet the objective and would
likely get a worse mark
don't care didn't ask plus you used a
semicolon in your reddit comment
this automatically disqualifies you from
being on a jury of your peers
you are you are not the every person
okay
a good again by the way if i was
critiquing already needless semicolon to
reflect more positively on your
intelligence than your writing warrants
uh we do not bold things in academic
writing we let the construction of the
sentence provide the emphasis itself uh
without resorting to garish tactics like
this uh
similarly
an uh bold here and then on italic and
you're doing an italic into a bold like
i feel like i'm reading a ransom note
right now
it's a little too much let your writing
speak for itself please a good short
story is compelling and its writing is
tight again overuse of italics it
understands how a sentence flows to
create rhythm for the reader and
exploits that it takes time effort and
patience to do a short story
m-dash overused much more than to get to
the first draft of a novella oftentimes
often times one word we're going to draw
a little line under that that goes like
this a different discussion would be if
you stopped reading at the cutoff point
for an average short story i personally
when this situation comes up for me in
real life which happens all the time uh
i go by the definition of 7 500-ish
words since that's what it used to be
defined when sci-fi short stories were
all the rage back in the 80s but maybe
the same number of pages as the next
largest story
objection irrelevant
and
self-inflating
italics and grade based only if the
story you read was satisfactory m-dash
we've already touched upon this as in if
the payoff didn't come because the story
was too long question mark
that's because he didn't meet the actual
objective of the assignment and marks
are redacted accordingly but i think
that would have to be a whole different
thread as well
source dude just trust me
um so you're actually
this this is
pure insanity to me
so you are going to not you didn't put a
cap on the story
on the length or anything like that the
student went over the top wrote a
novella you're not only
going to not give them a good mark
despite their ambition because like
you still haven't [ __ ] great okay
this is not the booker prize
it doesn't matter you know is it you're
not giving them you know a a 50 000
scholarship that could have gone to
somebody else that deserved it on merit
it's [ __ ] it's 11th grade it's
daycare you know get over it um
regardless
not only are you not going to give them
like a good score you're actually gonna
not read the whole thing
but you're gonna come up in your head
with a reason to mark them lower and be
like i didn't read the whole thing
because of the fact that this is not a
short story so i'm not going to do the
work and then also
i'm going to be like you almost tried to
make me do more work so you're going to
get like a b minus or something like
that that's come on that's too much
you're not like the editor of
you know the new england journal of
medicine
just give them an a
and move on
does it oh and then next time you can't
be like
you didn't give me a page limit um
or i i didn't give you a page limit but
i said short story and of course you
should know given that you were born in
[ __ ] what like 2004
you didn't know that uh the definition
of a sci-fi short story taxonomically
speaking based in the 1980s when they
were originally popularized was about 7
500 words it's too much dude you got
your you got your teaching
okay then you got to commute home
then you got to cook dinner then you
gotta clean up after dinner you gotta
hey honey how was your work day maybe
you got your own kids to worry about
maybe you got other tasks and errands
that are going on oh you got people in
your family that are dealing with stuff
you got you know money situations to
sort out you want to watch the new
episode of scandal all of a sudden
instead your base your your whole life
is now structured around finding a good
reason to not read this and then give
the kid like a b as a result
i think fundamentally no matter what the
student dramatically failed at time
management the work is unedited which
means it probably does have a lot of the
flaws in there this is roughly analogous
to spending all your time doing research
for a paper and then turning in a rough
draft for your final grade you haven't
even read the paper
it's probably bad just read a chapter
and then give them a c
how can you do this
and they they sound like they have like
some basis in science and yet they're
like i haven't seen any evidence but
here's the conclusion that i'm going to
draw from this
my my professor my phd supervisor would
not let me get away with this let me
tell you
yeah in 11th grade i was smoking glue
sticks on the back of the bus but this
would not fly in my phd program
and he was sorry i went a little too far
sorry sorry
the only thing with this though is that
taking off points for something the
student was proud of could discourage
them immensely maybe op
should just write a note saying it was
great but then take the word count down
a bit i've seen a lot where a teacher
reacted like this and it could take a
toll on the students efforts by a lot
good
good comment
i see where you're coming from though i
wonder if it's a bit babying for a year
11. that means the students are 17 18. i
think the right way to would be to leave
a note explicitly explaining it was a
good novella and i enjoyed reading it
even if i didn't just because i don't
like sci-fi but that marx had to be
subtracted because it's a novella and
not a short story
do they have to be
though who are you the the short story
police
do you oh it's only a short story if
it's written in bang or maine by stephen
king on a 72-hour coke binge
otherwise it's just sparkling words
i just don't understand the
overcommitment
to the name it just doesn't make sense
to me
guess this you won't be the [ __ ]
for not reading the story but you will
be the [ __ ] if you give it a 100 just
because it's long the assignment was
short stories as we all know based on
the 1980s those are around 7 500 words
technically he didn't listen to the
assignment hey hey hey hey you know how
you were planning on going to i don't
know like brown or something like that
hey your gpa just got [ __ ] because
technically this is not a short story by
the way i know i didn't mention any of
that in the rubric i just said kind of
go nuts one page minimum
technically
you're gonna have to set your sights a
little bit lower
there wasn't a word count since i
couldn't know how old 11th graders are
he might be excused for not completely
keeping to it he might have just had so
much fun but a short story indeed means
the writing is tight not drawn out over
multiple pages um well actually it had a
one page minimum so if he didn't draw it
out over multiple pages he would have
gotten marks down but anyway like
just just as long as we're applying the
same standards to this child that we
should be applying to one another
even if his writing was amazing he
didn't write a short story therefore
shouldn't get 100 even if the writing
was perfect this is how you create the
joker there's no
this is how you get a kid who ends up
like writing like the next da vinci code
which i'm not saying is a good book but
it was
very very popular then they go on conan
o'brien or something like that and
they're like hey uh so you met us yeah
you wrote the first draft for this book
when you were in 11th grade you gave it
to your teacher what do your teachers
say and that it's a funny anecdote
actually conan would you believe they
actually gave me a c-plus because it was
supposed to be a short story
i wonder what that teacher is doing now
oh uh yeah they uh
smashed their tv out of their sixth
floor window
because they couldn't live with the
regret they asked reddit how they should
you know deal with kids
i agree with the person above tell the
students you didn't have time to grade
them yet because you're just human
that's that's fair all of this is fair
i just don't know why you have to find
like uh
you have to have like a
a a nuclear bomb in your pocket that's
like if your kid if your student gets
annoyed that you didn't read the whole
thing you have to be like okay well
technically it was supposed to be a
short story and you wrote a novella so
here's your b-minus like it's just
it's just crazy man
i mean to me
it just seems like the teacher was like
hey go nuts write me a story over the
long weekend
should have put a page limit on the top
of it and then didn't
and now people are like well you did
bake in that short story
you would be the [ __ ]
it seems the students enthusiastic and
as their teacher you're plainly
obligated to assess their performance
yes it's long but a lesson is a lesson
learned a lesson learned is a lesson
learned
yeah
but like
it's gonna take like like two [ __ ]
hours to read that thing
can you imagine how long it would take
you to like
read a two-hour long
novella
and then also corrected
like that's and and you know like i
don't mean to be rude
but like
also
we're all on the same page that this
probably sucks right
like it's written by a kid
i'm not saying it sucks relative to the
other student's writing
it might be the best
but compared to the kind of thing that
you would deliberately like buy from a
bookstore and read yourself it's gonna
be like you know it's gonna be garbage
with no editing or revision whatsoever
like it's gonna be
it's not gonna be a great two hours i
think
anyway
interesting
interesting but nevertheless i imagine
you ding your students for half-assing
an assignment right what difference is
it for you to half-ass the grading i
don't know maybe that one student isn't
doing 90 assignments whereas one teacher
is grading 90 assignments i'm not saying
you have to read the entire essay but
you would definitely be the [ __ ] if
you didn't
it's just no empathy whatsoever it's
just that the english language is not
like
emotions
wrapped up in words for some people it's
like it's it's
bite code you know that there's there's
a smart contract that was signed by the
teacher and all the students when the
assignment was presented
for her to not follow through
on her form of the uh her role in the
transaction is
ridiculous you know like she can't do it
it undermines the faith that we have in
the education system
anyway throw me a slash marker here
slash marker react



all right we are back with react court
it's been another week of incredible
react court content we'll go to top
posts from this week
i want to see some red flare please some
red flare
um am i the [ __ ] for getting upset at
the idea of my wife getting an apartment
to cut down on commute time to work
this is spicy i can already tell you
this is spicy
i've been supporting my family for
nearly 20 years and have a solid career
at a great job that is about 35 minutes
commute one way from our current home
you know what
not that unreasonable a 35-minute
commute
is probably maybe a i think it depends
where you live it seems somewhat average
my wife after 14 years of being a
stay-at-home mom went back to school and
earned her degree she found a position
at a prestigious job her dream job and
started work a few weeks ago i honestly
could not be happier however her job is
in the next town over and her commute is
quite long one hour and 10 minutes one
way
two hour okay
look half an hour is like the minimum
drive
handsome pants thanks for the gifted
subscriptions i will return to the hard
court at some point i promise
um
like
even a a five minute drive is half an
hour
you're you get in the car you buckle
your seatbelt that's another two or
three minutes you know your parking et
cetera et cetera
every drive is about half an hour long
even if it's five minutes an hour though
two different times per day i mean
you're actually like 12
of your day
if you're awake for 16 hours is like
commuting
that's that's a lot the 12
of your
work day five days a week or of your
work week i should say is commuting
it's enough to to i could understand
thinking of trying to come up with
another solution then
bombers thank you as well by the way for
the gifted subscriptions thank you um
yeah it's for her it's both ways one
hour 10 minutes one way two hours 20
minutes round trip admittedly this is
double my commute additionally your
position will require her to work
overtime for two months per year so in
all likelihood during these months she
will literally be driving working then
sleeping she's brought up several times
of the idea of renting an apartment
close to her work so her commute is
essentially zero and staying there all
work week see now this i know we're not
quite there
um
this is not the sort of thing i think
you can do if your commute's like an
hour
i think if your commute is like
you know
two hours
or it's in like a different
country maybe but like an hour
so you're gonna be like a married couple
like two days a week
and then
five days a week you're going to be
married to your job
that also requires you to do this
overtime i mean i'm not judging that i
guess necessarily but um
of course i hate the idea first i don't
like the idea of only seeing my wife on
the weekends there's additional burden
on me for cooking and feeding the kids
and getting them prepared for school
okay
even if they are older kids i mean like
that's pretty unfair then of course
there's the logistics of furnishing an
apartment short term and the financial
impact of of rent this this man is
cooking his kids
come on
um so tonight we had a pretty big
argument ending with me telling her it's
not happening of course now i'm in the
dog house we don't really have any way
to compromise in terms of reducing the
commute by way of moving
in an absolute perfect location she
would still have about an hour and 30
minutes round trip and mine would
increase to about the same
source
is heard like i'm just trying to imagine
this is her
job in like a pocket dimension how can
you have two points
on a
on a map
and yet you can't find anything that's
closer
that wouldn't also make you go much much
longer
would still hold on mine would increase
to about the same one hour 30
i mean i got to be honest with you
now that i'm thinking about it i'm like
moving so that you have a 45 minute
commute two times daily and she has a 45
minute commute two times daily
that seems okay
that doesn't seem that your commute gets
15 minutes longer
go 10 minutes longer hers gets half an
hour shorter
can you just say what you want to say
which is like you're going to be living
out in the middle of the wilderness but
um
can i also also uh say something
i look some people like driving some
people hate driving
i feel like if i had an hour and ten
minute commute that's long don't get me
wrong like that's enough
but that's like prime
carpool karaoke time that's prime audio
book time
you know you can listen to music that a
podcast time yeah i'm sure you get sick
of it don't get i'm preaching from the
ivory tower right like i'm i work from
home
it's very convenient
i feel like the thing that sucks about
the commute is that you have to wake up
in time to be able to spend an hour in
your car and then be at work on time
the actual act of driving is not that
bad i suppose
and the other i mean also like the time
of being in the car is not so bad at
least for some people myself included
um but then like finishing work at five
getting home at 6 30
starting to cook dinner probably is not
going to be ready until like 7 7 30
you know you do you eat you do the
dishes it's 8 8 30
you take a shower watch survivor go to
bed that's very relatable
still anyway i mean we've already looked
at all the relevant information
i mean i don't think he's an [ __ ]
i i mean like maybe i'm the [ __ ] for
the way i'm approaching this situation
to some extent but i'm like unless
there's almost like a just a balance
sheet question here to some extent right
like how much money is is this bringing
into the household and how much is the
apartment's rent gonna cost and does
that make any sense
uh at all to work for 40 hours a week
when you know 15 hours of it is going to
pay for a secondary uh place to live
that is non-essential
foreign panda bear thank you as well
thank you
um
for the gifted subscriptions
i feel like there's there's like a
there's a compromise to be made here
which is you know we'll try to find a
place that is in a more amenable
situation for the commute i really don't
like the way the guy's saying there's no
way to fix this all i could do was cut
her commute in half and make mine 30
longer like that seems like that could
be actually a practical solution
um
but i don't know let's see this i'm kind
of like in an info position here but i
don't think he's the [ __ ]
for
being like i don't want to just be a
part-time husband like i think that
makes sense
maybe this is her way of finally having
a break from cooking after i suspect
being the only one cooking and feeding
the kids for 14 years
source
dude just trust me
i suspect yeah
i wonder if there's an element of this
where she's pushing him to contribute
more to the household chores i wonder if
despite her change of circumstances he
still expects her to also be a full-time
housewife and this is her way of backing
out of it what the hell are you talking
about man
i suspect source dude just try this is
what the internet is like and it's
probably been like this forever
but
like i feel like in the last five years
especially it's like people will like
tell a story and then they'll be like oh
i miss the part where like you you know
are you abused your spouse either
physically or emotionally i can read
between the lines come on think about it
for two seconds like this is crazy
maybe it's her way of cheating doing
heroin and her abandoning her kids if
you're going to assume or suspect things
that nobody said let's go crazy with it
that's so good find some people with
some sanity
yeah maybe he clubs baby seals too one
of his major objections he cites is that
he would now have to cook and help the
kids go to school he should be
anticipating doing at least half of that
work anyway it sounds an awful lot like
he does not think that's his
responsibility unless she lives
elsewhere and that would go a long way
towards explaining all of this what the
hell are you talking about it's it
there's a difference between
uh
like
i don't want to do any of this work and
i literally have to be like the only
parent doing everything five days a week
like a hundred percent on call at all
times
yet precisely he literally says all she
would have time to do is drive work and
sleep yet somehow magically thinks
she'll continue to support the entire
household's needs by herself if she
lives at home like he downplays her role
because they're getting older now but
then he whines about the possib
possibility of her being homeless and it
falling onto him to support the family
that's
he he said they're getting older now so
it's not that much work for me to take
care of the kids but he just wanted a
little bit of a break this is this is
insanity man
i'm losing my they're just making stuff
up
have you ever met a human being
like hey uh i don't want my wife to
live outside of our home
for literally 80
of the time like i would rather you know
sleep in a bed with my wife at night and
you know you know co-parent and have
quality time together oh is it because
you can't be [ __ ] to cook for the kids
and you think she should be a housewife
no matter what
no oh really because i think it is
based on my own willful
misinterpretation
not the [ __ ] but she supported your
endeavors for 14 years time for you to
be the supportive one
why do you assume o.p dreams of labor
okay great comment um
look there's
at least slightly more
uh fairness here
to some extent
but like
i don't know i kind of feel like maybe
i'm just a fiscal [ __ ] to some extent
where i'm like
you know if her dream is to
have a second apartment
uh so that she can
work at her job without having to drive
like extra time every single day
maybe like this a dream where you gotta
we could compromise on that dream a
little bit
i mean i i it's just it's just strange
to me that
like i didn't here's the thing okay i
guess this again i'm i'm wary that this
could make me an [ __ ] but i didn't
realize like when op was going to work
for 14 years and like knocking out the
rent and you know climbing the corporate
ladder that was him doing his dream i
kind of thought that was him like
fulfilling his responsibility as a
spouse and a father to be the bread
winner well you know i'm not saying the
mom had a break while she was staying at
home but he served the role that he had
fallen into for himself and she was
doing the stay at home raise the kids
uh you know handle the household stuff
i'm not saying that's the way it should
be
i'm just saying like was she putting her
life to the side so that he could work
as an assistant manager at hertz
we we need more information about the
situation
like if he was
climbing if he was touring with coldplay
or something like that and now she's
like i want to do my own thing i get it
but if he was
if my man was just like eating it every
day and like driving a tow truck or
something now he's [ __ ] rolls downhill
right
anyway
to work okay look
to work can be freedom and
self-fulfillment in many ways you'll
truly understand this in your soul if
you were ever a stay-at-home mom hey now
that like this is
i've said this to kate and i have said
this
about the situation that you know kaiden
i have with the baby as well to other
people
i
get the easy job
sincerely
by being able to work partly because
my job is streaming um we'll see how
this comment goes by the way before we
agree 100
but like it's
more draining
to look after a one-year-old baby for
seven hours than it is to stream for
seven hours that might not be true for
all jobs okay
but it's definitely true for what i got
going on so i have nothing but respect
for
the the stay-at-home mother the
stay-at-home father like it's it's a lot
of work
and it it it's not like labor is the
extent like your muscles are burning at
the end of the day but you're like
psychologically drained is your only
company is
somebody that is like completely
helpless and going like
gaga right so like i totally i feel way
more drained after spending three hours
with a baby than i do
you know after spending three hours with
chat so i'm not insulting the the work
at all
i can understand that but let's see
what's going on next
because everyone's saying insane comment
insane comment
i've worked and i've been a stay-at-home
mom
and the worst most depressing suicidal
and trapped was the first five whole
years of my kid's life when i was
literally stuck at home
no adult conversations a huge gap in my
resume that places me at the same level
as a 19 year old in the job market no
personal or professional accomplishments
to show for it i can i can understand
that honestly
i know reddit loves the anti-work
sentiment but most of y'all are male
kids
look they're not wrong but probably
you didn't have to say it you have no
idea what not working does to a person
being a mom is [ __ ] and you're
essentially useless once your kids
become independent okay that's just
insanity let's go a little too far
she didn't support his endeavors but she
did her being at home saved daycare and
her husband gets a lovely pay and a
resume that actually means something i
can imagine you're thinking the poor
husband is the real loser because he had
to go to work you don't get that he had
the privilege to work all you had to do
is throw away your job and commit to
being a chef poop cleaner chauffeur made
nanny nurse and more 24 7 to know what
it means do it i dare you look okay
this was harder on her than it was on
i was expecting
um
the
i hate to sell out the other parents
okay
some of this is fair okay
chef
okay i guess it can be kind of annoying
this is the one that gets me poop
cleaner just get over it's not that bad
i do
i
willfully
just genuinely whenever i get the
opportunity
i have like five extra minutes and i see
that the baby's diaper is soiled
i am like hey kate let me change the
baby's diaper because it's such an easy
thing to do
that also
does something nice for the person who's
been looking after the baby
it's like you you do the easy job the
hard job is the
malaise that comes from like hours and
hours and hours of like looking after a
baby the actual task itself is is not
that bad like i'm not giving sympathy
for that chauffeur okay
maid nanny nurse and more 24 7.
look
this is
i don't want to
look you're not being a nurse 24 7.
you're not being a a chauffeur 24 this
is probably like 20 minutes every other
day
you know this is like
for very scary periods of hours once
every six months like i it wears on you
but you don't have to like lie
to the poor people out here
she supported their shared household in
one way while he supported it in another
i
yes i agree with this and her
contribution involved being a maid and
everything else i mentioned above i'm
laughing at her wanting to get another
apartment she can finally be free a
little
just this lady hates her husband uh and
kids
i'm not saying because and i've talked
about this before as well
i hate when
i mean there's two aspects of this right
like one aspect of this is i i hate when
parents are like oh my dang kid so
annoying i can't do anything blah blah
blah
but i also hate when people are like you
know oh it's not poop it's a beautiful
digestion miracle i
i'm so fulfilled with every second that
i spend with my kids and like no matter
what it's always like such an amazing
time i'm like come on
there's some times where you're like i
just want like five [ __ ] seconds of
like
i want to talk to an adult human being
about something that isn't like yeah
that's a giraffe you know like you get
over it you go through fits and spurts
there's a balance of like burnout and
sometimes you're just like i really just
need to brush my teeth but it's been
hours i can't brush my teeth
um
you you miss like parts of the you know
you miss the time that you have to look
after your own needs first okay
at times so there's a good in a and a
there's a good and a bad to it but when
someone is like you know i mean i just
feel bad for like what this lady is
saying is basically like hey
yeah you went to work for 14 years um
you know full time
probably busting your ass that's cool
and all but honestly like [ __ ] you for
being selfish now it's my time i'm gonna
get my own apartment and finally be free
a little bit you had all that freedom
working that budget rent a car
you got 45 minutes of lunch time a day
where you could eat a sandwich out of a
ziploc bag next to like six people you
hate
you know like now it's my time now it's
my time to finally live like my carrie
bradshaw life
budget has unpaid lunches well you know
don't care didn't ask plus you got to go
to the office
anyway that's i just i think this is
unfair okay
okay sure
whoa bazinga
how was your and your wife's child care
arranged arraignment
oh my god for the last 14 years how
about household chores was it 50 50 was
stay-at-home parenting something she
really wanted did she have to sacrifice
her career education for the two why are
you using two question marks here's a
question for you mission ad6674 why are
using two question marks in uh every
single statement it makes it sound like
you're arguing from a bad faith position
where you've already made up your mind
and aren't actually asking for
information but instead ask asking very
specific leading questions in order to
paint the op into a corner and look as
bad as possible to fulfill your inherent
biases did she have to sacrifice her
career did your wife have external help
to look after the kids and the home
while you work like a like an [ __ ]
did she have time me time or breaks
my word
everybody sucks here my boyfriend and i
were in a very similar situation last
year he got an amazing promotion in a
location one hour 15 minutes away i
insisted he gets a small flat or rent a
room for two reasons i want to know he's
safe if he's tired or stressed or
there's bad weather that makes driving
dangerous i prefer he comes home two
days later than not at all okay
fair enough
maybe she's german
how
this is an honest question how
why is this german capitalization
i i'm unfamiliar they capitalize all
nouns
i didn't know that
every noun is capitalized in german
i had no idea i i genuinely did not know
t-t-i-l look at that
they're sick and twisted
you know it's just
i had no idea quite frankly anyway
i i thought this was like an autocorrect
situation like she was typing on her
phone and she always starts sentences
with promotion so it was saved in her
predictive text with a capital p or
something
like she was always texting her
boyfriend promotion today question mark
but maybe not um the mental impact
knowing he can skip the commute if he
wants to not be forced to drive when
he's already worn out that being said we
do not have kids okay don't care didn't
ask then
and
you know you got no idea what it's like
being a nurse nanny poop cleaner clown
iron man captain america the hulk wonder
woman uh black widow
gordon ramsay marco pierre white ember
lagasse every single day 24 7.
i think your wife is selfish for wanting
to stay the whole week as a default and
i completely understand your point and i
think you're right but i think you
should consider getting her a little
place to stay for difficult days or the
two heavy months you mentioned hey you
know what i can actually find
some common ground here okay
when she has to work the overtime her
having a short-term accommodation for
two months
makes a lot of sense so she's not
literally
basically losing
her whole life except for working and
driving during that period
like a yeah like a like a two-month
airbnb or something like that you know
or it may be a hotel where it's not
unreasonable to to stay for two months
but
to like have an apartment
long term
like ad infinitum just seems crazy to me
like isn't that gonna destroy your
budget i just don't understand
i guess it depends where you live maybe
you live in a place where the you know
salaries are are
very high and rent is very cheap i don't
think that happens too much but maybe
maybe i'm i'm too vancouver pill
where i'm like people are living like
eight people to like a two-bedroom house
or something like that you know
anyway i mean the way i i'm just
surprised
i mean this is pretty much where i'm at
right oh we're getting dan rated is that
what that is we're getting
i was wondering what the pluses and
minuses were
it wasn't one guy there was like two
guys okay
i i thought they were uh
i thought they were
trying to explain how the
places could have been
uh aligned in order to make the commute
not so weird
you know
i'm just surprised how many people are
lighting this guy up that's the thing
i'm surprised nobody is like you know i
can understand why you wouldn't want to
be a part-time husband yeah okay here we
go
why is everyone in the threat assuming
that she's being forced into being a
stay-at-home mom okay well i might even
if you're right i might have left that
question alone because
that one's not gonna
it's not gonna create a lot of sympathy
for you but he why is everyone assuming
he doesn't help with the housework thank
you why is that everyone assuming that
you can afford to just move to a new
house
or have an apartment and a house at the
same time
tell me you're still in high school
without telling me you're still in high
school let's go owned based and upvoted
okay i mean sure that
not the here we go reasonable not the
[ __ ] this is a difficult position
but she does have a responsibility to be
part of the family not only would it be
damaging to the kids to rarely see their
mom but it's an unjust burden on you
since you both have full-time jobs a
compromise could be heard getting a
hotel room a couple times a month when
she's working late or negotiating a
couple work from home days that make
based and lives in the real world pill
it's my alts
i'm just i'm you know i guess the it's
the the [ __ ] rises to the top man
you know the cream's supposed to rise to
the top
but the the the top comment was
literally like
don't care didn't ask plus you're like a
misogynist
it's crazy man
there i think there's more not the
[ __ ] here going on here it's just
that the the
people latched on to the you're the
[ __ ] that are at the top
it's crazy man
like we had some some spicy messages
right off the right off the jump there
okay anyway hopefully there's some that
are more fun
am i the [ __ ] for using my husband's
name to get a table and a free meal at a
restaurant for my sister's birthday
um
who knows
okay well now i have more context so i'm
technically still married
but we aren't together anymore only our
families and a few close friends know
about the arrangement we have
for my sister's birthday we really want
to go to this restaurant the thing is
it's very hard near impossible to get a
table even with a few months notice and
we only had two weeks her husband called
originally and had no luck my sister was
super disappointed so me and her husband
promised both to keep trying the first
day i called i had no luck the second
day was the same but i asked him if i
could take he asked if he could take my
name and number
no i asked him if he could take my name
and number he was reluctant but after i
told him my last name he completely
changed now my husband used to take me
to this restaurant a lot and i know his
dad is friends with the owner
but i wasn't expecting any special
favors or anything yet after i told him
my name and he asked me if i was related
to my father-in-law he magically had a
table available for the exact date and
time i wanted it the owner was also
there the night we went and he refused
to let us pay for the meal because i was
my husband's wife
a few days after my sister's birthday my
husband calls me he never calls me
unless it's important so i answered he
wasn't happy i used his name to get into
the restaurant especially since i never
told him beforehand
uh-oh
and accuse me of enjoying the perks of
being married to him without wanting to
do my wifely duties he said if i was
going to do this again he would have to
reconsider our separation am i the
[ __ ] this is some like 50 shades of
gray
stuff right
what i mean
i think everybody's assuming the worst
and they might be right about wifely
duties um what do you mean he's gonna
reconsider the separation
what are you what's he gonna do hey you
could do you keep using my name to get
dinner reservations i'm gonna move back
in
that's a threat i guess it would
like
go through with a legal divorce but
honestly it sounds
like you know
i mean i'm just saying
the legal precedent is it tends to be
worse for the guy
than the than for the the wife so
it i don't know it just kind of seems
like i don't know what the rest of the
arrangement is okay that's all
it is seinfeld
you're breaking up with our breakup
i'm sorry this
just isn't working anymore
anyway um
i like
so here's here's something i would say
okay
i don't really think she's an [ __ ]
for
saying her real name
to the mater d
and then having them
i
mean i guess they were like are you
related to the father-in-law
yeah she is that's her father-in-law
and also like you're the maitre d
like what like oh are you related to the
father-in-law uh i'm legally obligated
to let you know that i [ __ ] hate his
son and we're still legally married by
the way have i told you about our
arrangement like
you know it sounds like they
i mean this is like is the rich people
code right this is skull and bones
you know it's like oh you're a gaff
again well yes we do it turns out our
finest table is actually available for
the price of on the house like this is
when you deal
with winks and
nudges and and secret handshakes and and
stuff like that
occasionally you're going to end up with
a miscommunication i think
but you did the secret wink i do you
know i just had some dust in my eye
also there's like another part of me
that's kind of like um
go for it you know
i mean i kind of feel like she
she owned them
that's i guess and not in a bad way
the restaurant was like you're too poor
to go here get in get in the gen pop oh
we don't have space for you oh is it
okay if you stand and you have to be out
in 20 minutes
then she was like oh you know i'm a bush
and then they were like oh right this
way to the gilded table and then she
even got the meal for free so honestly i
think if anything
she didn't do really anything wrong
except maybe make a lie by a mission the
restaurant took it and ran with it
who cares
big whoop right
i don't think it's that big of a deal
uh and honestly this is for me this is
like i don't care didn't ask you're not
the [ __ ] plus your your husband
sounds [ __ ] weird
your husband sounds like he needs to
have a pacifier in his mouth to climax
during intercourse don't care didn't ask
you own the restaurant congratulations
you're plus your husband's a weirdo
let me i get that is everybody's of
course there's going to be some level of
everybody sucks because she stole from
the restaurant you don't understand what
it's like in the but you know
i i'm i'm willing to give this the based
veto quite frankly
i'm going to give you and everybody
sucks here rather than a you're the
[ __ ] just because of the wifey duties
comment something tells me that's
probably why she uh
put that in there
does it that that comment it's a very
interesting thing because it doesn't
change
the situation that happened
but to the lay person the layperson goes
like
well you did the wrong thing but then he
was an [ __ ] to you so as a result the
thing that you did wasn't that bad
as a based nl viewer myself i'm like
that see that's not relevant to the
situation plus she didn't do anything
wrong imo
still you were definitely an [ __ ]
when you let the restaurant think you
were still married you took a comp meal
out of the restaurant's pockets and put
your ex or his father in an awkward
position when the owner talked to him
and found out
honestly
i'm still like owned
i do based on what it said it never
seemed like
maybe she let this out by omission in
the post okay but she did not
like go oh i'm gonna go home to my
husband it did did they not say oh hold
on
like
just give it a sec
the owner was also there and he refused
to let us pay for the meal
it seems like i i mean you never know
what happened
in the actual situation but like it
seems like she was like you know no
that's fine and they're like no
i would never let my
friend's son's wife pay for a meal here
and plus the goal she did was use her
i don't know it's this is just weird man
it is it's a rich people problem yes no
question there
um
okay
i don't know what people expect from am
i the [ __ ] they they like the only
way someone would be like not an [ __ ]
is if it's like uh you know oh somebody
i i accidentally cut someone off in
traffic and they shot up my car with an
ar-15 am i the [ __ ] people are like
no you shouldn't have cut them off but
at the same time you shouldn't shoot
someone's car with an ar-15
you know it's if there's any nugget of
like
possible
uh
misunderstanding it's like everybody
sucks here you you shouldn't have done
that bad thing you know even if he did
hit you with a comically oversized
hammer on your head afterwards causing
your eyes to springs came out of them
and shot them out of your head and you
got crumpled into uh a position that was
like 1 8 of your normal size
not the [ __ ] if it's your last name
you're still married to him you didn't
lie you shouldn't have done the free
meal thing well yeah
but that's more like a we shouldn't have
done that
it's not like you shouldn't have done
that this seems fine
not the [ __ ] you gave him your name
they asked if you were related you
answered truthfully
yeah you did nothing wrong and what does
that even mean reconsider your
separation
if he has a prenup that may leave her in
an uncomfortable position okay i guess
that makes sense
but the husband's still like a total
[ __ ]
it's just weird man this
you can't threaten somebody like that
what are you trying to keep her on the
payroll just so she doesn't
use your name to get into the corner
table at dorsia
info
okay sure
not the [ __ ] you used your name yeah
yeah okay you know what most of the
comments are like
not the [ __ ] i i i'm back on reddit's
side temporarily
most people were on the same level here
uh oh
this you got a scan let's skip the one
about the drug addict let's that's they
don't cover that on seinfeld how about
this one am i the [ __ ] for coming
into work just on time
i work as a security guard i was
scheduled to start working at this new
store today starting from 10 a.m which
is when the store opens
i get there at exactly 10 am asked to
place my belongings in the back room i
was in the room for a few minutes max
and then came back out to man the door
which in that time i guess many
customers had already come in and one of
the sales staff had to play security
on my lunch break the manager approached
me and asked next time if i could come a
little bit earlier next time so that by
the time i put my belongings down i can
be front of the store at 10 am i told
her no that if i'm rostered to start at
10 am then i will show up at 10 a.m and
that if they want me to come earlier
they'd have to arrange that with the
security company i'm not getting paid to
come earlier then the store would have
to arrange that oh sorry i can't read so
i really don't see why i'm required to
she got huffy with me and said the sales
staff aren't trained to be security
and with the popularity of the store
there will be people lining up waiting
to go inside
i need to be here earlier because of
that she said it really wasn't that hard
to come a few minutes earlier and then
it wasn't fair to come just on time i
know it's not hard to come a little
earlier but i feel it's more about the
principle if you want someone to come
earlier then make that clear through the
hours i told her such and she just
sighed
and walked away we didn't talk for the
rest of the day so am i the [ __ ] for
coming into work just on time
this is uh there's there's a rare
confluence of
you're the [ __ ] butt-based
you know this is like when you insult
somebody who shouldn't
uh like they shouldn't have said
something but you came back with
something that was such an order of
magnitude higher that you are
the [ __ ] just by definition right um
i
look if your boss asks you to come into
work an hour early unpaid that's not
cool if he asks you coming to work half
an hour early
unpaid that's not cool i could totally
understand your position
if you got to come into work literally
like
like three minutes early
to put your stuff in the locker so
you're ready to start your job at
10 a.m like
that's pretty standard
like you it's not like you show up at 10
and then if you got to take a dump
like you're take you know you're you're
in the clear
you gotta
be ready for the job to start
when the shift starts you don't show up
when it starts and then you're ready
whenever you're ready
this 50 cents in wages
look
we all gotta
work together here okay okay is there
there's a lot of wage theft
there's a lot of exploitation
showing up to work
three minutes early so you got time to
put your stuff in the locker so you can
be ready for your job
that's pretty normal
that i mean that's pretty normal in my
opinion
i mean people are like that's that's 18
hours of free labor a year
is it for one let me let me run that you
know let's say you work
for a round number let's say you work 50
weeks a year
five minutes so you're getting there
about a half an hour early
per week it's two hours a month times 12
months okay yeah you're in there
can i run something else by you that's
not going to be popular
a lot
there's maybe you would consider that
unpaid labor
there's also going to be a lot of time
at any job but maybe particularly at
this job that's paid on labor you know
what i mean
i'm not saying that
i mean i think that's a good thing
i i don't think that you should have to
audit like well he's not actually
working as hard as he could in this time
so he will pay him a little bit less i'm
just saying
you know the three minutes that you're
there you shove your stuff in the locker
it's also going to be probably like a
half hour where he's standing at the
door when he's just in his own head you
know what i mean
that's paid on labor
anyway like look again i i think i'm
being
painted unfairly with the the the brush
by the r slash anti-workers right
you just show up
literally five minutes early you put
your stuff in the locker you go to work
and then you do what everybody else does
when you gotta take a dumpy
you extended an extra
two three minutes and now you're even
you take little psychological
breaks when you know your boss isn't
really paying attention to get you
through the day
anyway
i'm also like uh
there's a part of me that's like uh
how can you even show up
at the same time
i feel like there's five minutes of
tolerance plus or minus
when it comes to arriving in the first
place
i mean maybe this is just you know
because i historically it's changed
lately but historically i'm like an
early person i was literally never even
like a minute late for work because in
my head i was like well in order to
ensure that i'm there on time
essentially
if anything happens on the commute
except for like you know the city having
a
10.0 earthquake or something like that
um i have to leave with enough of a
window surrounding me that most of the
time i'm gonna show up five minutes
early anyway
anytime i showed up like exactly on time
it was because there was like a little
extra traffic and that's why you built
it into the commute estimate to begin
with
i'm not saying five minutes early is on
time i'm not trying to get argue from
that boomer position
i'm merely suggesting that if you want
to be exactly there at 10 a.m every day
you know that means you kind of got to
leave like expecting to be there at 9 55
but
you know if one of the pedestrian
crosswalks has a hand up instead of
a walk symbol then you're still gonna be
there on time
anyway i'm
look
the other thing that i've been hiding
from you is that
i'm a part of the
severe plurality here for sure
like for the the people that are like
this is the worker exploitation hey you
might be right but
you know
you're gonna have to find a different
website that to get enough people to
agree with you i think probably some
discord communities imo but anyway um
look again i think there's a if they
wanted you to be 15 minutes early every
day
um
unpaid that would suck
i i think that would be borderline like
you know maybe have a conversation about
it um but like if they want you to be
there in time to put your stuff in the
locker and then stand at the front door
by 10 a.m like
come on man like you gotta
you gotta meet him like halfway there
at every job i've had if you're
scheduled to start work at 10 a.m that
means you well it means you get there or
you you had 10 at the dot or on the
floor available to work if you're in the
back putting away your belongings you
aren't working okay look they they said
what i'm not confident to say
but agree with you're the [ __ ] the
start time is when you're expected to
work not walking in the door
you're the [ __ ]
you do need to be paid for the hours you
work you need to be your assign station
and ready to work at the starting time
this i mean
if your shift starts at 10 you start to
work at 10
you can't be there at point 10 and take
your time to make some coffee etc if it
takes you five minutes come earlier so
you can start your work when your shift
starts
info needed what are the items and what
are you putting away
oh man is there any op comments here
not the [ __ ] screw jobs that nickel
and dime for less than five minutes if
they want you there at 10 they should
schedule it that way unpopular but i
truly do not care don't expect your job
to be happy about it though especially
since they already pulled you aside to
talk about it pick your battle i mean
honestly i don't disagree with this
either
like
i would like to think that
if i were the manager
and maintain my current disposition
i would be like you know five minutes is
not a big deal i'm happy to stand at the
door or whatever um i like it's such a
minor thing to generate conflict for
on both sides to some extent but it also
does sound like places you know busy and
crowded at 10 a.m i can understand why
they would want to have like a security
uh guard that's active even for that
five minutes um
so i i i do i mean i don't disagree
hugely i mostly i'm like when people are
like you should take your boss to the
like the ministry of labor because this
is illegal wage theft that's where i'm
like come on man
that's you know
some days i have some gastrointestinal
distress maybe i need 17 minutes for my
bathroom break uh after four hours i'll
eat my sandwich on the john
you don't nickle and die me for those
two minutes and sure i'll be happy to
you know start two minutes early or
something like that
it happened you know we've all got to
get along here
i guess i don't know here's a they
could you
they look can i
they probably have him scheduled 10 a.m
to like 5 p.m just because it's a
seven to eight hour
times the hourly wage that's like easy
to calculate um
i mean i if if you could just add five
minutes to the payroll i think that
should be totally fine as well
if if they can do that sure why not
that being said i'm just
maybe this makes me like a total [ __ ]
i don't think i would want to work with
this guy and maybe that makes me
a a
corpo okay
i'm just like even as like a co-worker i
think like if if it was day one and like
he came in and was like well actually
like i'm scheduled to be here at ten so
like if you i would be like i don't
wanna work with this guy this seems he
seems annoying like this just seems
annoying as hell
like if you wanna do this [ __ ] go to law
school okay this is old navy
like we're just trying to we're taking a
year off from senior year
trying to make a little bit of money
have a cool spring break figure out what
i want to do with my life
like you know
go to law school fight the good fight
there don't i mean i guess he's he's on
the ground doing it but
i'm just saying
i'm not i'm not saying he shouldn't be
saying i'm just saying i i personally
think i would find him a little annoying
anyway
i mean i think pretty much everyone here
was like pretty reasonable
i'm sure if you go to controversial
there's going to be like lots of
interesting ones
holy bursh
i'll tell you what
this person does not show up for work on
time
it was painful how far down i had to
scroll to find someone who wasn't
declaring that you should be donating
free time to employers bro look
[ __ ]
sorry
look okay it's
it's three minutes okay i'm sorry like i
i know that that
flies in the face of distilling
everything down to its most broad
principles
but it's three
it's this it's literally this the same
as the the pizza one where the guy
borrowed two dollars
from his sister and then his sister was
like you've betrayed my trust even
though like you pay me back immediately
it's like
you're not wrong in principle
but
it's three minutes it's two dollars your
family maybe not at old navy but
if it's if it's only three minutes why
can't they just pay him for three extra
minutes no i agree i'm just saying like
it's only three minutes then
you know is it really worth fighting
over obviously some people have drawn up
the battle lines don't get me wrong i'm
just saying
it's 200 in wage theft all right i mean
i guess sure
i don't know and you know what from
having to work with this guy i'm going
to need a counseling session once every
two weeks so like 150 bucks a session
so you know i'm the i'm glad we we
ironed out this 200 in wage theft and
i'll pay four grand out of pocket to
just gripe about the situation at my
toxic workplace
instead
just schedule him for like 9 45 can we
like or fire him and hire somebody who's
not going to complain okay those are the
just hey this situation cannot stand one
way or the other okay
we gotta figure in the real world you
have to make some compromises at some
point okay this this is seinfeld though
for sure
oh man is it hold on was that a okay it
was a it was a throwaway account i gotta
know man
i i honestly feel like this i meet
people a little throughout my life i
have met people that uh
they live in the literal
and
it is where you end up with the the
walter situation right from the big
lebowski which is like you're not wrong
but like
come on man i'm just trying to like
knock out the damn rent
i get it but
yeah
am i the [ __ ] for not
telling girlfriend i had a son from a
prior relationship i can't imagine
how this could not be
um
you're the [ __ ]
and it seems like that's how it bears
out but like
there's no context at all in two
paragraphs that could save you i became
a dad at 17 to make things worse let me
stop you right there
not the way you should be writing about
your relationship with your child in
public
to make things worse my girlfriend at
the time my son's mom was plucked from
doing anything
her mom just said she's done they
stopped any and all communication and
walked away i moved on i'm hoping she
moved on i don't know what this means
they took the
their they took the daughter
they took the sun and
left with no communication
he or he got left with the child
i don't know
i'm 22 23 here soon
about um so this is 17 man that's
ancient history geez that was like why
are we talking about stuff that happened
in 2016 man like
come on we're living in the 2020s now
you know why you dredging up all this
ancient history
about a month or so ago i met this
amazing fun sweet beautiful girl a few
nights ago we went on our third date
feeling poorly that i'd hid a huge part
of my life from her to start i told her
i had a son she at the time was like
chill she wanted to go to my place and
meet him so he did that i woke him up
told him someone wanted to meet i woke
him up
that's so
whoa woke up my
my six-year-old son was sleeping
yeah
hey this is
it was getting pretty serious we're on
our third date look i'm not it's it's
not that bad it's just kind of funny
i would be are you crazy you just meet
an afternoon on like a sunday or
something like that
okay
told him someone wanted to meet him they
hung out for half an hour or so oh come
on man it's a school night when we were
alone she let it be known that she feels
as though she was played in a way that i
should have told her on date number one
i had a son
yeah um
yeah
it's kind of like a soft you're the
[ __ ] like
i don't know man like uh
i never went through this
did people in chat are saying three
dates is pretty okay
really you don't do it like if you had
like an hour and a half long first date
you couldn't find a time to be like
when they were like what's your life
like you're like by the way i live with
a five-year-old kid that's my own
i feel like it's that's a pretty huge
thing to bring up and it's not like i
mean he felt remorse and then he brought
it up in a fairly reasonable time frame
but yeah i think it kind of is like
it's a little bit of a you're the
[ __ ]
doesn't mean you did an [ __ ] thing
that doesn't mean you're irredeemable
you're the [ __ ] yeah i mean i'm glad
other people got to this one you're the
[ __ ] you don't wake your kid up in
the night to meet a girlfriend much less
one you've dated for a couple weeks i
definitely
agree with that as well
the the the wake up part is like and
this happens on
on am i the [ __ ] on occasion people
are like you know
they write a story that's like am i the
[ __ ] for not letting my date steal
breadsticks from the buffet and then
like in the middle of the post it's like
you know
so i told her she'd never amount to
anything and am i the [ __ ] for not
letting her take the breadsticks and
people are like no but
you know for telling her she'll never be
a good writer because she doesn't have a
curious mind that makes you a little bit
of an [ __ ] you kind of shove that
part in the middle
you're the [ __ ] firstly be honest
from day one secondly don't wake your
kid up in the middle of the night
lastly don't let your kid meet someone
you've only been dating for a few weeks
or most
counterpoint counterpoint i have no
username sorry counterpoint
amazing fun sweet beautiful girl you
ever consider that
i just
like i have some anxiety i think it
comes
like clear and and it comes across in
like the way that i talk about social
interactions and you know like my
experiences at the deli counter in the
grocery store i'm constantly like making
sure i'm not getting in anybody's way
and and oh if this person comes here
they're going to want some space so i'm
going to move over to the side and and
when i'm walking on the sidewalk i'm
looking behind me to make sure everybody
can like get like i i over analyze the
state of the environment that i'm in but
reddit just
i read some of these comments and i'm
like it must just be so exhausting to
like live
like you're
pretending to live or maybe this is how
you're really living like yes the only
time i would wake my kids up in the
middle of the night if is if there was a
fire they need their sleep
okay yes
but it's half an hour
one night like it's not
like he's
the kid's sleeping in the bed and like
once every you know three days he just
like throws a bucket of ice water on his
face or something like that like it's
just a one-time
mistake like oh did this you child
services should go take put them in the
foster system now right like
op needs to get a lot more serious with
their child's mental health
like
you
no
like
like kind of like again it's like you
know it's like you know
oh normally we eat at six i was really
stressed out i lost track of time i
ended up making dinner for my kid at
seven instead of six people would like
read that and write kid as growing
children need regularity and youth
starving them is not helping them you
need to get your own things together
before you even become uh it's crazy man
like it just happens something [ __ ]
happens
you shouldn't have woken up the kid for
half an hour right that's hilarious but
also wrong but come on needs to get a
lot more serious with their child's
mental health
i mean who's talking
that's just it's one night man
i agree kids need sleep it's just anyway
you're the [ __ ] for awake yes okay
yes yes
of course yes
you're the [ __ ] for introducing your
child to a casual date
kids shouldn't meet dates until you're
as good as engaged honestly i don't know
if that's true it might be true um
most of my experience with this kind of
stuff is like robin williams movies from
the mid 1990s or you know stepmom
starring julia roberts like i don't
really know when this is supposed to
when the introduction is supposed to
happen so that that might be true for
all i know
but everything i know about this
situation i learned from mrs doubtfire
very soft you're the [ __ ] hey a sane
human being
that's something you should tell someone
you're dating on the first date don't
get me wrong i don't mean let her meet
him or anything i 100 get protecting
your son however people have a right to
know this information some people don't
want to date someone who has a kid fair
very soft
you called him a very soft [ __ ]
this guy woke up his kid to introduce
him to a girl he has went on three dates
with this guy is a major [ __ ] for
this alone
do you ever think
that it's possible
that somehow we've slipped into
like a
a time that is like morally as
puritanical as the pilgrims
maybe maybe that's a slight exaggeration
but like the guy woke his kid up for
half an hour he was excited about his
date he's 22 23 years old
and this person has got 96 upvotes he's
a major [ __ ] for waking this kid up
he's a major [ __ ]
like what what would i consider to be a
major [ __ ]
the wrestling promoter from spider-man
one
who
uh
toby mcguire is going toe-to-toe with
bone saw he wasn't even expecting to
last more than 30 seconds anyway the ad
said
like 500
if you can stand three minutes in the
ring with bone saw
he ko'd bone saw in like a minute and a
half and then the guy goes that the ad
said for three minutes you ko'd him in a
minute and a half and then he said
that's not fair and then
the promoter said i missed the part
where that's my problem that's a major
[ __ ] okay
which is why it feels so good
when that guy gets robbed and toby just
goes
that uh
when he moves out of the way to let him
get on the elevator
and then he gets him back with his own
line i miss the part where that's my
problem yeah then it backfires on him
yeah yeah
then it backfires on toby as well
there's a lesson in there somewhere
but then uncle ben was like i missed the
part where that's my problem
toby maguire was like what's ama gonna
do uncle ben was like i missed the part
where that's my problem it's a whole it
just is like
keeps going man it's
it's [ __ ] does anybody else see how
[ __ ] this is
anyway
i'm just saying this two
major [ __ ] like we got to be nicer to
people i get the irony trust me
but like
it's that's a little mistake you
shouldn't have done and now you're like
standing with the gulag it's too much
everybody sucks here
you should have told her you had a son
and she sucks for being really
inappropriate and asking to meet your
son on the third date bro she's like 22.
i don't
you're just 22 years old i don't know
what kids are like when i'm 22. you see
the offhand comment
like hey i'd like to meet your kid one
day all of a sudden this idiot's driving
me back to his place waking up his sons
i didn't mean like right now like
jeez there is assuming she's around the
same age she probably doesn't have that
much experience with kids well i agree
it was wrong for her to ask to meet the
kid i'd have a hard time calling her an
[ __ ] there's uh
24 upvotes versus 133 does nobody else
see how absolutely [ __ ] this is
people they they think in such absolutes
man



am i the [ __ ] for telling my ex he
would have to cook and clean if he
wanted to live with me after our baby
was born
i don't you know it's a helpful award
look at that
so my ex has never had the cooker clean
for himself he has always had someone
else to do it for him i know he can cook
at least one dish though since he did it
during one of our previous dates
you have lived
or you've been in a relationship with
this person long enough they're still in
your life
even if they're an ex
you know he can cook one dish because he
made it on one of your dates that's
tell me one thing about this human being
it's like you have you know nothing
about them
i don't understand
it's
it could be it could be ramen with egg
super salad right now i'm six months
pregnant and my ex wants us to live
together
i thought okay here's what i thought
okay in my head
i thought it was
they dated this person let's say
2013. they broke up afterwards they
remained in contact this person then had
a relationship with somebody else they
are having a child together but for some
three's company two guys a girl in a
pizza place type reason he's like i'm
getting evicted can i live with you guys
for a bit and here's where it happens
but you you're
let i'm not the master of relationships
but
i would say a good test
for whether or not um you should have a
baby with somebody is
can you
name
things that they can cook
art can can you name anything about
their personality like for example
you're having an a human being
with another person
you don't know if he can do anything but
cook one dish as he did it during one of
our previous dates like you don't you
don't have an intimate awareness of
this person their life their hobbies
that's all i'm trying to get at is i'm
so i'm the cooking thing is just a
symptom
of the greater cause which is like you
don't know you don't seem to know enough
about this person to comfortably be
having a child with them but anyway
right now i'm six months pregnant my ex
wants us to live together for the first
year of our son's life i agreed because
he had a good argument and i know i'm
going to be glad for the help
that's fair
things were fine until he told me he
thought i should move in with him now
instead of closer to my due date
i told him i wouldn't move in with him
if he wanted to live together he would
have to move in with me he argued
against it and kept insisting things
would be better for the both of us if we
lived in his home since he had more
space and neither of us would have to
worry about cooking or cleaning
what
eventually he did agree and then gave me
a list of requirements his cook had
it is this like a my roommate situation
when actually
what you're saying is my mom
or is this like
is is this christian gray from 50 shades
of grey i i don't know
no he's rich okay
so i asked him what that had to do with
me
eventually he did agree he gave me a
list of requirements his cook had the
cook has requirements for the diner
there's so many i'm getting stun locked
too much but i am just confused like
every sentence kicks up a little dust
that gets in my eye and i go what
uh i was confused so i asked him what
that had to do with me he told me then
that his cook would have to work in my
kitchen while he was living with me
you have two apartments
mom apartment dad apartment house
whatever
when
mom moves to dad house
chef from dad house
has to cook in mom house
and then bring it
other other way
he's moving
oh he he's moving into her house and
bringing his personal chef
okay well then this this makes more
sense it's not that confusing then okay
all
right his cook would have to work in my
kitchen while he was living with me so i
needed to make sure i had everything
ready for him i told him i hadn't agreed
to that just [ __ ]
look i get it you're six months pregnant
life's hard you know it's annoying
you're getting a personal chef what are
the requirements it's probably gonna be
like have some spices have some cookware
like this is don't look a gift horse in
the mouth
he then told me his cook would have to
work in my kitchen okay i told him i
hadn't agreed to that he brushed it off
by making a joke about us still having
to eat and him not being one of those
jerks who expects me to do everything
right after giving birth i told him no
and he asked me who was going to do the
cooking and cleaning if i was refusing
his offer to have help i told him he
would split it 50 50 like normal people
he got annoyed told me he didn't have
time to cook or clean and that i
shouldn't be doing it right after giving
birth it turned into an argument which
basically ended when i told him he would
have to cook and clean if he wanted to
live with me after our son was born he
told me he would think about it in an
angry tone hasn't spoken with me since
are you stupid
you get what like you
it
i think she's being unreasonable and i
didn't expect to come into this
situation thinking that
he's handling the cooking and the
cleaning by paying for it
and is he's not ordering mcdonald's from
doordash every night it just sounds like
you've got a personal chef i'm assuming
you're eating good healthy meals like i
just don't understand why you're like
it's and it's on he played it off with a
joke and said we still have to eat and i
don't want you to do it right after you
have the baby and she's like you think
that's funny
[ __ ] like
it sounds like he's actually being like
kind of an accommodating
guy quite frankly
it's like like this guy's going to work
and he's going wow you know my
ex-girlfriend you know she's six months
pregnant she's having this baby soon i
got her like a personal chef and a
housekeeper and she told me no i have to
do it
there oh
i looked this woman dead in her optic
stems
it just seems
unreasonable just in case people ask i
don't want the cook and cleaner to come
to my house because my home is small and
it will get overcrowded since i know
both of our families are going to be
over a lot
i feel like the cooking cleaner is just
a stepping stone he has way more people
who run his household and i feel like he
is too dependent on them so he will
expect me to be okay with them working
in my home too see it isn't hard to
clean my home it's small and cooking for
two doesn't take am i the [ __ ] is
this like a
i
look i think this is a is a situation of
you're letting pride get the better of
you okay
is
i don't mean to be rude
it sounds like you live in a
smaller place and he lives
at monticello um
i kind of feel like you should just
well i mean i guess i there's there's a
couple of things worth pointing out
maybe that are defensible for her
hello
can i show you you can show me but let's
not put it on
to camera
the morning oh
no
the baby's at daycare right now she's
she's a little upset no that's this
morning yeah yeah
and then
she was playing very well okay
hey
and then
she looks she's in the stroller it looks
like she's in prison right now
it's very cute though
and then
uh
she's napping right now whoa pog
isn't that crazy i can't believe that
she has never napped by herself
ever today's the first time that's huge
pog and she's she's hugging a
look piglet it
so cute right
let's go
i don't know that last one but it's just
like really dark yeah
yo napping's supposed to be like the
the hardest part yeah is she the only
one there today i think so
how does that happen
they're all scared of the bomb cyclone
i'm telling you
i was driving today it was little
atmospheric missiles trying to
trying to strike me was it was it no not
at all i told you it's just like it was
raining a little bit let me fix that
okay
she's fixing the the crash bandicoot nft
yeah there's an atmospheric river too
it's kind of it's kind of dangerous here
right now um
we're being spared most of it up here
yeah kate's gonna save it with super
glue we're gonna re-collateralize it um
anyway
like i can understand why
the
mother would not want to just be
completely dependent on someone that she
doesn't want to
spend her life with like maybe she
doesn't want to be in a relationship
with this
guy long term so to like move into his
house and get used to
you know living in the manor and having
everybody take care of you and then
later maybe you feel like that takes
away some of your freedom to be like uh
you know later like okay i'm gonna leave
now
um
but it does sound like she's being a
little like
too prideful
i mean it honestly everything in her
post makes it sound like he's like a
nice guy
and she is just being unreasonable like
i don't understand why he needs to be
the one to clean if he handles the
cleaning
and the cooking through a different
avenue it's just
it's very strange to me
but there is some divisiveness
no question about that it is one of
those things i'm surprised how many rich
people take their problems to am i the
[ __ ]
where i'm like
haven't you gotten the memo yet nobody
wants to hear about this like you're
already
whether you're the [ __ ] or not the
[ __ ] the majority of people that read
this are going to hate you and be like
this isn't a real problem
have you not learned that lesson by now
like are you are you nouveau riche
you're the [ __ ] i can understand
wanting to stay at your own place but
why are you trying to control
how your ex eats if he's in a position
where he can afford a personal cook
there's zero reason for for you to
forbid him from doing what he always
does
your reasoning makes no sense if you're
not comfortable with having the cook in
your place then your ex is right you
should go live at his place as soon as
the baby arrives you're gonna be so
happy to not only have your ex there but
also glad you don't have to worry about
cleaning and cooking
this this all tracks for me imo
sorry i couldn't finish reading this
don't move in with your ex
sorry i couldn't finish reading this but
by the way i am going to reply as if i
had read it all um he's an ex for a
reason and having a kid together is a
terrible reason to cohabitate i'm going
to be honest with you
i think it's kind of like a pretty good
reason to cohabitate a bad reason to
cohabitate would be
you know you're close to your favorite
coffee shop um a bad reason to
cohabitate would be
maybe it makes it easier for you to get
to the transfer station on the subway
line
being supportive of you know the mother
of your child after she has a baby is
like probably one of the best reasons to
cohabitate tell him you've changed your
mind and you'll work on a visitation
schedule through the courts after birth
what is wrong with people man
these people want to live their whole
lives at the courts
this is the same
i've talked about this before in my life
people have such a big old like
have any
hard-on for contracts you know hey my
boss wrote into my contract in fine
print if you sign this i get to steal
your blood people are like did you read
the contract
well
they're too bad should it don't care
didn't ask sounds like you're reaping
what you sowed honey it was in the
contract everything in the contract is
totally fine you know it's just
it's they have an amenable relationship
right now it sounds like they're having
a great communication you didn't even
read the damn post
and you're like take him to court for
what
i don't even know why like regardless we
don't need to get involved with all the
lawyers that's what big boy said in
roses remember and judges just to hold
grudges in the courtrooms i want to see
your support brought then i'll support
you
the philosophy of sir lucious left foot
i can't believe people are upvoting
someone suggesting having to get a court
order to see his own child when all he's
done is ask to be involved and offer a
cook slash cleaner uh
i can't believe all the people in here
can't see the red flags surrounding this
man source
i watched three seasons of you on
netflix
run honey
it's just
it's so much head cannon man okay sure
sure yeah that's fair
everybody sucks here he's your ex you're
no longer together i don't think bad of
a person who's well off enough to have a
cook and a cleaner it's their life good
for them
you said i'm not going to be glad for
the help so does it matter if the help
comes from his maid and cook nope my
view is that he has the bigger space so
why don't you want to move there instead
of cramming into a smaller space it
seems you're going to do that in a
larger space would be better and you can
get away from each other instead of
crammed inside of a smaller place you
can rent your own space for the year and
make some cash for you this is not the
topic either just my view
is it's a little crazy man
space space space
box box box
i can't deal with this man it's too much
it's just like
i
i if you spend i think this is real okay
like i honestly think um
i i have a hunch let's not make this too
scientific i think that there will be
studies in future decades maybe not for
a long time but that will show that the
psychological impact
of
spending too much time on social media
is like
the the damage is
akin to like alcohol abuse
i'm not saying that twitter reddit is
worse than
being an alcoholic because there's also
the physical effects i'm just saying
like on a psychological level like what
reading this stuff does to your brain
like i'm primed to like
now i'm reading this and now my world
view is that everybody else out there is
simply like um
like that that
uh delphi
machine learning
moral bot that that looks at every
situation through the epistemic
i can't say that word
epistemological lens of is this right is
this wrong and if somebody's on the
wrong then it doesn't matter to the
magnitude they're just like you know
[ __ ] you i'll see you in court it's
crazy
like
i get that this is a
subreddit for
judging that kind of stuff
but at the same time like
the fact that there's no uh
at least in the top upvoted post there's
nobody that's like hey
i think you did a wrong thing but i can
understand why you did it instead the
top post is the most insane person
you've ever met
who's like you need to turn yourself in
immediately
do why do you hate your son
do you not think that children need
sleep
you woke him up for
25 minutes to meet someone who you
probably were naively in love with let's
be honest but at the same time i can
understand why you would feel that way
like yeah i guess the normal people are
out here just like living their lives
this what i mean is like when you you
spend too much time on twitch
or reddit or twitter you start to think
that like everybody that you see on
earth is like this it's not true it's
probably like 20 of the world's
population most of them are only like
this when they're online when they're in
real life they're like yes sir thank you
sir i'm very sorry very sorry oh you
won't believe what happened to me this
is ridiculous today there's some bloomer
walked in front of me can you believe it
i don't know yeah
it's it's just crazy man
we gotta we gotta get along
oh here we go am i the [ __ ]
my ex is mad because i deleted her old
animal crossing off my switch
my ex is mad because i deleted her
animal crossing game off my switch we
ended our relationship mid last year she
moved out of my house back in april
she wanted to buy my switch because it
had her island on it i said no based so
she asked me not to delete her island
she would get another switch and move it
over i deleted the game off my switch so
i could make room for mario kart
and that i could play with my friends
it's been six months
since she left not to mention that she
didn't play it for about a month or two
before she moved out but it was plenty
of time for her to have gotten another
switch she just messaged me upset
because i guess she tried to play my
switch and found i deleted the game am i
the [ __ ] p.s she's at my house
watching our sick kid while i'm at work
because she has the day off what the
hell man
i thought you were like 18 years old
i thought i mean i guess you still could
be
it's less likely but you were like kind
of a dick
before
um
but perhaps justifiable and who cares
but then the last sentence like oh by
the way she's watching our sick kid
right now
is not
uh good
uh
i gotta think so i'm just trying to
think about this okay in my head
um it you the edit is kind of irrelevant
it just reflects poorly on you for no
reason whatsoever
look i i hate to be the info guy
but like
what size is
animal crossing right like you couldn't
have deleted
anything else
usually there's like four things you
gotta delete one of them
nobody's saying you can't play mario
kart with your friends but like
yeah plus the november 5th update is
coming
i'm just saying you know i
did i just i i i feel like i'm not
necessarily saying this is a you're the
[ __ ] i'm just saying like
you could have avoided this whole
conflict
also i'll just be honest like this makes
me the [ __ ] for sure
but like you have a kid like shut the
[ __ ] up about your animal crossing
island or like i wanted to i had to
delete it honey to play mario kart with
my friends like you have a baby or a
child like
i'm not saying you can't be a gamer and
also have kids
like you're really posting on reddit
about like oh my ex-girlfriend's mad i
deleted or animal crossing island like
just like shut up and
contribute to your
roth ira man it's like you got it it's
so minor i always just put myself in the
people get emotional for things that are
to some extent outside of their control
in the moment and only later when you
know cooler heads prevail can you be
like okay
like word i'm sorry about that okay but
i just i always put myself back like
imagining if like i was eight
and like
my mom was like you know did you delete
my animal crossing island i would
i just can't imagine it it's basically
what it's
it's okay so someone in chat said you
have a child stop caring about other
things i mean that's not necessarily
what i mean but it's like when you have
a child
you know that the importance of other
things in your life are adjusted
to a huge degree of like relativity
you know like i i hate to say it but
there's that tom segura bit which is
like you know i before i had a kid i
thought that i loved my dog
you know and i did but now that i have a
kid like i would i think in his words he
says like if the
if the dog hurt my kid i would strangle
them with my bare hands and look at my
child for approval right like it it
reworks things in your life where you're
like you know if you
if animal crossing's like up here and
you have a baby
maybe animal crossing doesn't like move
too much but the scale completely
changes like the y-axis totally changes
it just is a it seems like a petty
problem
for
you know you to come crying the reddit
about for validation at this point
i'm not even really mad at
the ex for being mad about the island
being deleted i'm more like come on dude
you have you've like sired on offspring
and you're like hold on i need the
internet to tell me i'm a good guy like
just
suck it up
it's just i don't know man it's just
it's weird to me okay that's all i'm
saying
yeah plus save data is different from
game data man
you couldn't have just deleted the game
preserve the save it's crazy
we have a a newly reconstituted
crash bandicoot nft there's still one
piece missing one flick of hair
yeah i don't know where that is probably
probably in the garbage can
look at that now it's not 29 of 65 now
it's like a one of one
it's kind of fixed let's go
thank you
just making sure
because it's just a hair piece
you can't see what i'm seeing chat but
i do appreciate it thank you
it i don't think it's going to be backed
i
i probably it happened like a month ago
is probably like a blue piece of plastic
i threw it in the garbage can she's
missing or it's missing like a little
tuft of hair on the side i'm not
sweating it too much
this is the new found freedom we get
when our daughter is actually in daycare
um
you know for for hours every morning
it's it's nice it's opening our lives up
a little bit for sure
if i'd known the amount of
labor that would go into
preserving this thing that i got sent in
the mail like without
even giving my permission to activision
oh geez but you know what it is better
to have loved and lost and reloved than
to have never loved at all um
all right i mean i don't know i feel
like i i just want i'm i'm a glutton for
punishment man like i need to click on
this and like see an essay
i need to see an essay to to feel whole
not the [ __ ] would have been nice to
let her know but by no means a
requirement
that seems fair
why does your ex have access to your
switch delete facebook
hit the gym and lawyer up
you're the [ __ ] i was gonna say not
the [ __ ] until they saw you were
co-parenting a child hey here's the
thing again
that is not relevant to the animal
crossing situation
i agree op did themselves a great
disservice
by
compromising their position with that
edit okay
i don't think it's relevant i think like
you know
the the issue of whether or not
it should be able to be deleted is
you know separate from oh my kid is sick
right now and she's over
i think it oh how is it relevant because
pissing off your co-parent is just going
to make your kids life worse
yeah extra drama doesn't matter when
it's your ex you'll never see again but
it matters a lot when it's your kid's
parent
okay
i you know what you've you've convinced
me a little bit at least
and then you and you've especially
convinced me because the person who
replied says so everyone should cater to
the person who likes to start drama
it's a little
too much i mean i think both people
should not care that i mean you know my
philosophy right i
i try to avoid conflict except at the
deli counter he probably should have
deleted i don't know maybe like
bayonetta two instead of animal crossing
knowing that there's a chance that the
mother of his child would want to play
it at some point especially when she
comes over to look after their sick kid
but at the same time she hasn't played
the damn game for six months i don't
think you get to come over and be like
oh you were you deleted that i was
saving that for later like no you
weren't if you were saving it for later
really like you were saving the thing in
the fridge until the day that i threw it
out because it went moldy like after six
months of not eating it you were like
you know oh i was gonna eat that for
lunch today really because it's october
you bought it in april so i'm kind of
surprised that
that just the day that i happen to be
like i'm going to throw that out is the
day that you're like i'm really hungry
for that specific thing
i'm also confused how he how she has
access to the switch
are you still messing around with her
are you still messing around with her
holy
no i'm at work and she's watching her
sick kid because she has the day off
what a what a [ __ ]
oh man
not the [ __ ] she had enough time to
solve the issue i agree yeah yeah yeah
the people saying you're the [ __ ] are
crazy you two are no longer a couple abd
she expected you to hold on to something
for over six months without having any
contact you owe her nothing
i mean i'm like
again it's like it's all in absolutes no
you kind of owe her something like
if you're if you're co-parenting you
have a situation where it's like you owe
each other like a certain degree of
respect and keeping like an amenable
relationship going
uh
but then like you know
it's like they co-parent that's true i
mean i literally did just say that but
at the same time it's like yeah but it's
also an animal crossing save
it's not like he shot her car up with an
ar-15 or something like that
it's not that big of a deal
i don't know maybe maybe it is
but i'm like it's not okay because she
didn't play for six
months all right that's i at the end of
the day if i have to make
a stand
you had you had six months to get an sd
card or something
to get a nintendo switch
you didn't talk about it at all you
weren't like oh i'm so jonesing for
animal crossing then like
the statue of limitations like uh
has expired on it
you can't back up to an sd card all
right well
what if it was kate's i would never
delete my wife's animal crossing save
but that's because i'm smarter than the
person who made this post
this guy is on we're not equals don't
compare us okay i wouldn't
i could hear her laughing in the other
room
why would you do why cause your life's
hard enough why are you trying to cause
problems for yourself by like deleting
something that she wanted to save
like don't be stupid i'm just are you
were you stupid to delete it yes
probably were you in the wrong no i
think no
but still i mean you you could have
worked there's such an easy work around
right like
info who bought animal crossing like
this [ __ ] is just i know it's a bad look
just go ahead don't even argue the point
against me bad look bad look bad look
number 101 bad look it's a 60 game
from almost two years ago you have a
child together info who bought animal
crossing you ever see the photo of like
that divorce court in 1999 where the
couple's getting divorced but they can't
figure out who should get the beanie
babies so they pour out the big bucket
of beanie babies on the floor and these
two people who used to be in love they
were like building a life together they
said till death do us part or on their
hands and knees
sorting through the like doing a fantasy
draft of the beanie babies
because they think like oh i don't want
her to get the princess diana beanie
baby this [ __ ] like they didn't realize
like in six months they were going to be
worth like 75 cents each it's just a big
waste of everybody's time because the
same energy
who bought animal crossing you have a
kid
it's like one day of daycare
you're gonna you're gonna get it go
go into your online banking print out
the receipts get out the highlighter
well as you can see here we used my
mastercard at toys r us in march 23 it's
this is not relevant it's
it's too much
it's simply too much
it only has nine upvotes okay i'm not
gonna cry about it but still
am i the [ __ ] for asking another
player
in dungeons and dragons to change the
name of their character because it goes
against my religion you can have
a name that goes against your religion
this one is dangerous and spicy
hold on
yeah maybe they're like a devout mormon
and their name is uh uh brewed beverages
i just don't know i got i mean i gotta
this is we're gonna put up the spice
veneer for a second did you know by i
don't know how real this is okay but i
saw this on twitter filtered through tik
tok
and it was like tell me your uh mormon
without telling me you're a mormon and
then they said they used to get asked by
their friends to do bed humping at byu
so i said okay what the heck is because
what it sounded like to me
was i'm familiar with the concept of
soaking where you're not allowed to
have intercourse for pleasure but you
can
insert the penis into a vagina um but
it's illegal to
thrust that's right hum jump humping
that's not bad humping
so what you do is you have two people
soak
and not move
because that's not okay
the lord can see your intentions but if
you happen to be soaking and one of your
friends that you asked
jumps on the bed to generate some
friction
uh
who am i to stop them right like that's
like a loophole where i guess
god is like you got me
that doesn't count as [ __ ] somehow so
you're good like don't worry about it
it's real apparent i'm not saying
everybody does it okay
but apparently this is like a real thing
that happens in some university dorms
it's one of the funniest things ever
just
move your hips man like i get it it's
it's bad look mister 101 here comes mr
101 again he's
uh hey he's trying to criticize what
like 50 million people worldwide or
something like that like some kind of
jerk i'm just saying
you know what
i'm not saying you should not be allowed
to get salvation
but
surely when you get audited
at the start of heaven
you know when you're at the gate and
they're like is your name on the list
they're gonna be like hey you know like
when you were 18 and you were soaking
and then you told your friends to like
jump up and down on the bed just so you
know like for future reference we
totally like consider that [ __ ]
you're not smart you're not that smart
like
you can't just make up your own little
rules
down there on the big blue marble
without running them up the chain to see
if we
approve them right like you you don't
just get to decide that that's okay
you've gotta
go take a you gotta run it to the ceo to
make sure it gets approval like i think
they're just gonna be like i i think
they should just let them know like
you're not slick
i don't think they should lock the doors
or you gotta spend a decade in purgatory
or whatever i think you just got it you
know you know when you thought like you
were getting away with it you weren't
getting away with it we're just gonna be
cool about it but like don't do it again
okay
that's that's all i'm saying about that
and also
you know how you're not supposed to have
any brewed beverages but then
you you made a loophole because the
mormon church is they consume a lot of
soda they don't want to not consume soda
so instead we made it brewed caffeinated
beverages so then if you consume like a
caffeine-free beverage like a mug root
beer that does that's the same also we
knew
we knew what you were doing on that one
we want you to know we were also not
cool with the mug root beers
everything else is okay though all right
let's just be cool about okay sorry i
didn't even open the post i was supposed
to check
um
one moment i just want to see the name
okay
ted decided to name his character
after
the true
personal name of the lord
if you don't know what that is look it
up and you'll find out i can't say it or
type it here
when i saw the name of ted's character i
asked why he named it that
and he asked if i knew the true name i
said i did and said the name offended me
and asked him to change it he laughed
and said i was being too sensitive it's
just a character i said that naming a
character that goes against my religion
is offensive to me and asked him again
to change it the others got involved and
sided with ted
and told me to lighten up one of them
said they didn't really care about his
name but they wanted to get on with
playing so stop delaying the game
for the rest of the night i referred to
ted's character as ted's character when
i did that the others rolled their eyes
and the dm told me i was stupid look
i think it's a little silly at the same
time like i
can i be honest
i
everybody sucks here
if i was playing a game with somebody
and i named my character anything and
they were like you know oh that offends
me on like a religious level i would be
like okay now his name his name is uh
gomly or something like that you just
why why let it ruin why do people go out
they look forward to this [ __ ] like all
week and then when they go out they're
like i'm gonna take any excuse to like
ruin my day like what's wrong with you
you're trying to pick a fight with
everybody that you meet
it's crazy man
oh my god some of these are bad am i the
[ __ ] for not reporting a co-worker
for saying he'd like to see another
co-worker naked
am i the [ __ ] for telling my mom who
takes care of my baby that she's
replaceable
okay that you look we're in a unique
situation here i feel like
as a parent i could possibly
give some advice here
we got five minutes
am i the [ __ ] for telling my mom who
takes care of my baby that she's
replaceable i've never gotten along with
my mom she gives non-stop unsolicited
advice obsesses about tiny things and
believes every conspiracy theory
i've tried my entire adult just say it
you know what that means
she was january 6 she was at the capitol
you can say it i know that you're
worried you don't want her to get in
trouble with the law or whatever
you can go ahead and write it in there
we can all read between the lines she
was at the capital insurrection
i've tried my entire adult life to talk
to her about how we could have a better
relationship but it hasn't worked yet
she shrugs off anything that would
require her to change and keeps on
keeping on before this year we were low
contact
then i had a baby and my mom became our
full-time babysitter
we didn't ask her to do this
we could pay for child care but she
rushed to volunteer because she's
retired and has wanted a grandchild for
a long time in retrospect it was
probably a bad idea to start an everyday
relationship with someone i've chosen to
go low contact with
everybody makes mistakes
there's there's some acknowledgement
there
sometimes this whole arrangement works
my kid loves her we don't have to worry
about a stranger taking care of our baby
covered risk is minimized and it's free
and sometimes it doesn't my um my mom
argues with me about every single one of
my parenting choices even the ones that
seem obvious like no tv for the baby
no salt and sugar in my decision to
breastfeed and then to wean etc that's
annoying
certainly
the other day my mom asked if she could
feed the baby a cookie he's six months
old and just started solids that's too
early
i'm i'm
i appreciate a specific
example here that is too early
to feed a baby a cookie six months
they're eating like pureed peas and
stuff like that
put her in the cows
i said no a few minutes later she asked
again
tell me i wasn't
sitting in my car until 6 45
i said no i went into another room and
when i came back there was cookie dust
all over the floor i went to clean it up
saw there were cookie pieces in my
baby's mouth it was more crumbs than
anything it wasn't a choking hazard but
still who feeds a baby cookies
i flipped a [ __ ] i flipped the [ __ ]
about how this was not okay then my mom
started screaming back at me about how i
was making a big deal out of nothing how
ungrateful i was that she was taking
care of my kid how much she'd sacrificed
to be there for me during this time
i said sacrifice i never asked you to
sacrifice anything i never asked her to
take care of my baby she volunteered if
she doesn't want to take care of him
anymore no one's forcing her she
demanded to know what i would do without
her hire someone like i could find
someone who does a better job than her i
said yes if she doesn't want the job i'm
going to hire someone who listens to my
basic rules doesn't force me to watch
them so they don't do crazy things like
feed my baby cookies doesn't spend all
day giving me unsolicited advice and
criticizing my parenting i mean i gotta
be honest like
i wouldn't have known this like
two years ago right
because i don't know when a baby eats
whatever i still don't really but
six month baby eating a cookie is that's
really bad
like i'm assuming it wasn't like you
know a huge cookie to begin with but
that is like
that's super early
that's not like my five-year-old wants a
sip of soda and like i told them if you
do you're not gonna go to heaven that's
like uh
it's not as bad as giving them like a
little you know whiskey or something but
it's pretty bad
it has also like no nutritional value
whatsoever like for
our baby's first birthday we gave her a
cupcake
you know it was a big cupcake she ate
like
five percent of it but that's twice as
old she had been eating solids for
six months
and it was a special occasion you know
uh feeding a baby a cookie at six months
is is a little too early for sure
anyway
plus at the canucks game we fed her some
french fries
but in my defense
is the only way to get her to shut up
so so sue me whatever
she hasn't talked to me since though
she's still coming over every day to
take care of the baby win-win my dad is
demanding i apologize and i get it they
are doing me a massive favor and i am
grateful but i think i just told her the
truth this whole situation between me
and her is untenable and it would
probably be better if i hired somebody
else
um you're not the [ __ ] i got to get
out of here like we got less than a
minute before golf um but definitely not
the [ __ ]
you know you don't get to
i i understand that you're like i'm
looking after the baby i should have
some agency but like don't care didn't
ask plus you're not the parents so
it's kind of too bad
like i hate to say it
you know even if the mom was like you
know the kid's two years old in there
like you can't have sugar
i mean i guess this is where i become
like the [ __ ] yet again right because
i'm like
you just take the kid out for a walk and
give him a cookie then
well mama don't know won't hurt her
that and i don't know kate if you're in
the same boat maybe maybe we have a
philosophical difference
but like that's how i feel about daycare
you know and the daycare provider when
we were there they were eating like
nutritious stuff for lunch
they were eating some you know
red peppers like some roasted eggplants
and stuff like that and i'm like you
know
maybe once every six weeks if they end
up going through the mcdonald's
drive-through and getting a happy meal
they told us that you know she just
stayed oatmeal for lunch i'd be like but
i don't know don't hurt me
[Laughter]
as long as she comes home safe and sound
it's not a regular habit but
you know with especially within the
domain of the parent within the parents
home
you don't get to ask and then when they
give you the answer you don't want then
feed the baby a cookie anyway it's just
it's kind of crazy
you know i mean it's it's just very
stupid essentially
that being said yeah i mean it's gonna
happen if you if you live
you know you have your grandma
looking after your kid for free i don't
take my kids at mcdonald's man
she she's not gonna eat a chicken nugget
maybe a couple of french fries but the
chicken nugget like are you crazy
that's so you gotta take it home you
gotta cut it up into like thin strips
rather just come home give her like a
pouch of pureed prunes
which dip though i come on it's got to
be sweet and sour i'm not saying it's a
sauce only for babies but i think it's
the most amenable for babies



act court's demise are greatly
exaggerated greatly exaggerated indeed
here we are doing some react court we're
back
it's just that simple hello i'm large
and in charge of the bottom right here
um am i the butthole for telling my
cousin she doesn't get to call my wife a
terrible mother when she had abandoned a
child years ago that's a great way to
start it i think is just by like you
know the
perhaps like the most dramatic thing
that's ever happened to somebody in
their entire life sure let's give it a
try
all right i'm gonna get right to it
folks
yesterday i went over to my mother my
mother a house to talk about the
accident that happened with my
three-year-old who tripped off the
stairs and injured his knee while i was
at work he's fine nothing serious but my
mother was freaking out and wanted me to
tell her what happened in details the
family was there as i explained what
happened and my female cousin then
chimed in with and said oh my god where
the hell was this boy's mother was she
even home i said she was but was in the
kitchen when he fell and couldn't
prevent it my cousin then leaned back
and said how could she
i cannot imagine leaving my
three-year-old unattended for so long
what a terrible mother
wife's name is honestly i'm fuming at
this point
i look at her and ask if she's serious
and she gives me the most dense look
i've ever seen i told her she had no
right to call my wife
a terrible mother after she my cousin
abandoned her father her kids in foster
care years ago
she looks at me grudgingly and tells me
that that was years ago when she was too
young and not ready to be a mother
besides her parents made her give away
her son but i told her that is when she
failed as a mother because she
essentially didn't fight for her kid and
abandoned him so easily she lashed out
at me saying her circumstances were
difficult i cannot blame her but if she
is to commit to be a mom which she will
in the future she's 22 by the way she
will step up and parent her kids which
is something my wife needs to be doing
instead of spending time in the kitchen
for her internet clout
we argued back and forth and she ended
up leaving the room crying after i said
she is a failure of a mother if she
thinks my wife is terrible then
my mother berated me for unnecessary
cruelty and having a habit of bringing
up my cousin's unpleasant past to win an
argument no you don't say
um
i said that wasn't tries is she was
insulting my wife's motherhood but my
mother agreed my wife was being
neglectful towards our son and then she
needed to focus less on her facebook
blogs and more on family this really
does sound like and i think you should
leave sketch
you guys you were in the kitchen cooking
for your facebook blogs and our kid
tripped down the stairs almost broke his
knee
look at this and then it's like just a
little cut he almost broke his knee
i ended up arguing with her too then
leaving my wife got involved in the
argument after my mother called her to
berate her and told her to tell me to
apologize to my cousin for what i said
um
well
like
first off
if you're gonna run an ad for vip casino
then like pay me don't pay reddit
do not do not listen to this and do not
this is how they hook you
your evie on this is negative i promise
you i mean this is an anti-ad this is an
anti-ad for you um
the final verdict is
not the [ __ ]
um
53 say not the [ __ ] 31 say everybody
sucks here i'm definitely in the
everybody sucks here category um
i i think i and we can look at the
comments we'll do it quickly because we
don't have a ton of time today but uh
reddit is always
the the average am i the [ __ ]
redditer is all about
um
if anyone ever insults you they better
have lived the perfect life because
otherwise you can turn it around on them
and own them if somebody else fires the
first shot it doesn't really matter how
you
the magnitude of your reply to them if
you have a single leg to stand on so
someone could like cut you off in
traffic and you know then be like watch
where you're going you'd be like well
you should have watched where you were
going when you uh chose to get uh an
english literature degree uh instead of
civil engineering in university thus
setting your life on a path of fiduciary
uh minimalism you know they would be
like based based he shouldn't have cut
you off you don't have to go that far
you don't have to go that far what the
the adult way to respond to the
situation
your cousin insults
your wife as a mother
you say hey just so you know
i take offense to that that's really
rude i mean she's 22 years old overall
she's still really young you don't have
to drop the nuclear bomb on your family
that's those are the people you're not
supposed to drop the nuclear bomb on you
just say hey i'd like you to apologize
for that that's not nice and then if
they say i'm not going to apologize i'm
22 and invincible then you can bust out
the nuclear weapon then you can but or
you could just leave and be like i'm not
coming to the family gathering next time
cause she's kind of a [ __ ] instead you
have turned a not the [ __ ] into when
everybody sucks here
by really probably busting out the most
emotionally turbo charged
response that you possibly could have
instead of just you know
being the bigger person
asking for an apology telling her is not
that cool
instead you were like hey you know this
thing that's probably like the biggest
mark of shame in your entire life well
let me let's get into an argument about
it for like half an hour so i for me the
cousin sucks as well just for the record
but i would say this is like a this is
an everybody sucks here for sure i don't
even need to go in the comments i have
to imagine this has got to be like the
straight
the straight answer man
i can't imagine like uh
i can't imagine there's other people in
the comments well i don't know because
every time i always lose my mind people
will do it's not about the three dollars
that he borrowed and paid back it's
about the invasion of privacy
she's 28 years old and she should be
expected to just have her money be uh
just to buy her dinner i don't think so
it's about the privacy it's about okay
sure sure anyway that one i like that so
far i liked it
next
would i be the [ __ ] for suing a
customer for damaging an extremely
valuable item this is the kind of thing
that sends a chill down my spine i'm
trying to think i that one time
one time
i was in this is college i was in the
liquor store
my companion
with her boot
accidentally knocked a bottle
off of the bottom shelf shattered it on
the ground
and it was instant like
you know like metal gear solid
i didn't know what was going to happen i
was fully ready i was fully ready to be
like you break it you buy it
a maintenance came over with a dust pan
and a broom and i'm up
and i was like what's going on like is
this okay and they're like yeah you guys
can just move on i guess that's breakage
that's something that is just as long as
it's an accident and it's not too
serious then it's not that big of a deal
um
however
if whenever i'm in like a furniture
store like an antique place or something
like that this is what
this is what scares me yeah don't you
have to do dishes in the back like it
was a it was a 2 6 of uh smirnoff
i i think that's like at least two hours
in the back washing dishes
no my dad didn't make that up they used
to do that on sitcoms in the 80s right
uh sir your credit card's been declined
oh could it be that maybe your machine
in the back that goes
chunk chunk
chunk chunk actually is just a piece of
crap
no no it's got to be the card and then
you end up in the back there's this
dishes in the back you better roll up
your sleeve anyway sorry okay
let's see
for context i run a business selling
antiques and vintage items last month a
young woman walked into my store
blissfully unaware of the instructions
she would soon cost she walked around
for five minutes pausing her browsing
only to take a selfie in a 100 year old
mirror oh won't somebody think of the
mirror oh sorry to this uh oh this vein
lady
used a mirror to take a selfie excuse me
that mirror is 100 years old
it's never been used before i i already
kind of hate the poster
just because of the fact that like you
know you you got to present the issues
somewhat
dispassionately objectively instead
they're making it seem like paris hilton
came in and was like you know licking
all the donuts in the glass case and
stuff like that and oh she took a selfie
anyone else hates selfies like it's 2012
or something anyway
sorry um as she had so far been adhering
to my rules of no touchy
i was no longer paying her any attention
however if i had seen what items she was
eyeing i would have been the pair
together was initially valued around
four thousand dollars and i had a bid
for even higher okay just take it out of
the store then dummy
somebody
i i don't understand is this like some
kind of strange silent auction or
something like
i don't like how he says no touchy as
well i don't know if that's him thinking
that he's being cute going like no
touchy or if he's like
being really
offensive so it seems condescending no
matter what to say no touchy but
anyway
well clearly i just you have a 4 000
item in your storefront just chilling
not even in like a glass case or
anything people try to touch it no
touchy
like how old are you like eight or
seventy eight well clearly she did not
understand the idea behind valuable
items being placed on a high shelf in an
antique store something that i would
describe as we learned that all in like
middle school i think this woman
proceeded to standing on her tiptoes
trace her finger over the back of one of
the vases where there was some fine
detailing suddenly clang
she had somehow managed well barely
touching the thing
to knock it to the ground badly denting
a spot of the detailing as well as a
large part of the actual body of the
vase in all my time working in this
industry no customer has ever knocked
something off a shelf like that i didn't
know how to react obviously she was
extremely apologetic and she explained
she has a medical condition that causes
her hands to sometimes jerk
involuntarily
look
i
i've been very much on her side for a
while
i believe that that could be real
but then there is a part of me that's
like
maybe refrain from the touching of the
stuff in a store where things are
valuable like the more that
you know they say like
getting the last word is good
am i the [ __ ] is actually like the
exact opposite like the last person who
acted i'm like they're the [ __ ] every
time and then
someone replies to them and i'm like no
actually you're the [ __ ] now it's
like every action is just like a
we're just toggling the asshole-ishness
she said that she can tell when these
involuntary hand movements are likely to
happen and was sure she felt fine but my
point still stands would she let a child
hold an antique silver vase would she
cover her hands in vaseline and then
hold it your honor hopefully not
therefore touching the item was
incredibly naive and frankly a stupid
risk to take despite her damaging it
being an accident she she said she could
not at that moment afford to pay the
full price of the vase but could give me
half a payment now and pay the rest in
increments however i was close to
selling the pair for full price now that
one vase is damaged my original buyer
has decided not to take the set
rendering both vases valueless
i am not willing to wait however many
months or years it takes her to scrape
together an adequate amount i want to
involve the law as i think she owes me
at least the highest bid for the pair of
aces but when i explained the situation
to my friends they acted as if i'm the
villain
man this is like
this is just
a guy that
i can just picture him in my head and i
don't know if that's fair
but i just picture that like this is the
kind of guy who's in like the applesauce
section of the grocery store i'm just
trying to get by to get to like the
salsa jars but he's got like his cart in
the middle
and he's holding the side of it instead
of holding the handle so that he takes
up
the whole aisle
and he's just pouring over
motz mod sweden mott's unsweetened
organic a little bit more expensive but
it's just apples like it's just i i just
see him like honey i'm back from the
grocery store thanks for telling me to
pack those three granola bars you were
right it was a journey
um
i'm just
confused mostly about this um
one of them is if you have a higher bid
for
this pair of vases
why are they still on display in the
store
my hunch and i'm i don't have to prove
this within the legal extent of the law
my hunch is that so when other people
like you come into the store you can be
like oh you see those vases they're
worth 4 000 but i got a bid for even
higher and then these other antique
weirdos are going to be like holy crap
did you see that fine detailing
also
i feel like if you're in
a business where things are fragile
i don't know how this works okay but you
gotta have insurance right
like if you run a a
porcelain shop
got to be porcelain shop insurance that
i'm sure is like expensive
but that's why you got it right is so
that when your customer comes in and you
know break something like tacky as hell
like a like a a swarovski swan or
something like that like they're not in
debt for the rest of their life just
because they happen to like trip over a
duct tape extension cord on the ground
and then fell into a shelf
it's just i don't know if i'm like
you're the [ __ ] it's just weird like
i don't know
i i kind of feel like
i mean i
is there like a you're weird like a yw
you're the weirdo like i don't think he
would be wrong to sue
would he be a little bit of a [ __ ] i
don't know i actually i have no idea
i feel like i as much as i have a
personal distaste for the way this
person wrote this i feel like i gotta go
in the comments and i gotta steal
someone else's opinion as my own
let's see what we got here
you would be the [ __ ] she recognizes
the fault was hers and took
responsibility offering you a solution
even if you sued her in one she cannot
give you money she doesn't have as a
side note there's no way in hell a court
would have wore you the price of the
highest bid i forgot to mention this
this i that was the part that actually
annoyed me the most
was when she was the guy was like i
think i'm entitled to more than its
appraised value but instead what like
the highest person on earth would
actually pay for it that's just insane
that that reasoning has no sense
whatsoever
um
a court would not award her anything op
you're the [ __ ]
not having any business insurance is
illegal mouth did you know this
are we in breach of the law right now
do you have business insurance
if you cyber bully someone in chat and
they get so sad they have to take a day
off work are we
are we on the hook for that
i got to look into that man you're the
[ __ ]
does your shop not have insurance for
damages
oh that's right yeah jeffrey's got it
probably maybe this feels like trolling
but in case it isn't renders them
valueless is false she offered to pay
you 2k up front and more over time
i mean i'm like dude
i just don't know i just don't like this
person
i don't know if this is fair but i just
don't like this person i don't want to
read the words that they wrote anymore
quite frankly
i just find them unpleasant
i the [ __ ] for making my son pass out
the candy he got for trick-or-treating
because he was being rude oh this should
be good
this should be good
my son is nine years old we went
trick-or-treating like we usually do and
the night was going well except we got
to a house that had a bad
that had a bowl of candy sitting on the
porch and said take two please he puts
his whole hand in there grabs about six
pieces of course i corrected him made
him put four of them back explaining he
needed to leave some for the others from
then on he had an attitude and the last
straw was when i told him to stop
grabbing so much candy from people and
he screamed no
like caesar
we'd only been out for about an hour so
i took him right on home took his candy
bag dumped it in a bowl told him to come
sit outside on the porch with me okay so
up to this point not the [ __ ] at all
just like that's a parenting moment
your kid you know he's all hopped up on
halloween excitement he gets a little
greedy you teach him a lesson so far so
good even ending halloween early this is
fine so far this is fine
took his candy bag dumped it in a bowl
told him to come sit outside on the
porch with me he objected his kids came
by and took handfuls of his candy he
complained they were taking too much and
i told him that he shouldn't have done
the same then okay that might be
a little too far
you already got a good punishment he
ended his halloween experience that he
was probably excited for early because
he got an attitude problem
to then force him to give away his candy
to other kids and watch is a little i
think it's a little much
his father came home from work asked why
he was in his room crying to which i
explained why he said it was really cool
to give away the kids candy just because
he was taking a little too much i said
he needs to learn not to be greedy to
which my husband said it's okay it's
halloween he said i was being a jerk
that i should cut some slack for the one
holiday where kids get to pig out come
on the one holiday where kids get to pig
out
10 years old you're going to sleepovers
you're drinking like a whole two liter
root beer yourself the one holiday
like adults that one holiday maybe two
they get to pig out on thanksgiving
which is why everyone loves it so much
christmas or easter maybe kids are
picking out whenever they whenever they
please july 4th i forgot about july 4th
memorial day
valentine's day a little bit
no i did not give away the entire bowl
even if i had i would have had no
problem providing him more once he
learned his lesson and apologized that's
look i'm not parents you're in a tight
spot okay but like i'm just laughing at
the whiplash of the lessons it's like
we're going home we're gonna give away
all your candy okay now you learn your
lesson here's some candy kid's going to
be like i don't know what did
you expect a jab coming in he's taking
an uppercut right to the chin then all
of a sudden they're soothing him and
he's like bam straight shot right to the
right eyeball starting to swell up and
they're like
we've cooked chicken fingers for dinner
you're eating them up bam you know
give away the chicken fingers on the
porch
throw them in the garbage can oh this is
like it's crazy
never let them feel comfortable anyway
i'm just gonna say like as a as a parent
i think they're the [ __ ]
a little bit i don't think it's like a
lot
i just i do think the punishment is like
slightly
more than the the crime
like this part
up to this was totally fine right
kid was probably excited for
trick-or-treating they got greedy tried
to steal some candy mom made him put it
back
kid copped an attitude
told him to stop grabbing so much candy
he screamed no
that's the end of halloween that's good
that's an i don't know an hour out of uh
trick-or-treating they expected to be
out two hours three hours they expected
to get a lot of candy they're not
getting as much candy
there you go you've lost your
trick-or-treat privileges for this year
i think that's fair the kid probably
feels like that's too severe to begin
with now this part
where you forced him to hand out his own
candy to other trick-or-treaters is
based
and i think if your kid was like 15 16
this would be sick i would be all about
this when your kid is nine i'm like
it's a little
code of hammurabi type thing
like that's just a lit i'm not saying
traumatic i'm just like
it's just one step to fight like i don't
know if you should ever be in a position
as a parent where you're like impressed
with how clever your punishment is
i don't think you should ever be like
check out this
unusual punitive measure i took on my
child
that wasn't that apt i think instead
you're like you know
you could have just had them like you
know stay in their room for the rest of
halloween not get any candy till you
know wednesday or something like that
but anyway
i'm i'm in the wrong or at least in the
minority though
like look at this
not the [ __ ] 60 you're the [ __ ]
34. everybody sucks here come on
everybody sucks your kid is nine years
old
either the parent is the [ __ ] or not
the [ __ ] the kid is [ __ ] nine
he's nine years old you're gonna be like
that kid sucks
he's nine
okay so let's see what's go i i gotta
know what kind of made up stories when i
was a kid i said
and then they took it all and i didn't
have any left and i uh okay let's see
load me
not the [ __ ] the outbursts are what
gets me when he screamed no it sounds to
me like a test of boundaries as if he
knew perfectly well what was expected to
him and purposefully cross the line in
order to see if his behavior would be
corrected and you did that he learned a
lesson when he became resentful of the
other kids taking too much that's what
his behavior looks like
from the view of others
have you ever like been nine or did you
just get spit out at like 19
because it's like
i i don't have solid memories of being
nine but there were just some days where
you're like for whatever maybe something
you ate maybe you know your your brain
chemistry is all coming together you
just like
some days you're just like i'm gonna go
[ __ ] crazy i'm gonna lose my mind
and then your parents are like what are
you doing and you're like i don't even
know screw you and then you're like
you know you just like you just have
days that are weird
and halloween seems like it's that's
what it's based on it's like a is a day
for weirdness
i'm just saying this is like it's a
little too far
not the [ __ ] he's past the age where
he should know how greed affects others
i'm like [ __ ] dying here he's nine
i mean it's not zero
like
he's nine years old man
come on he's past the age where you
should know how greed affects others
have you ever seen like a 14 year old
those kids suck they're selfish in
[ __ ] they they didn't learn the
lessons you're supposed to learn like
nine
apparently
i don't people are not like good people
until they're
like
there's like a window like you kind of
suck
and then like i think from like
33 to 37 you're like i'm good with the
older generation i'm good with the
younger generation and then at 37 you're
like
[ __ ] everybody younger than me i'm
riding this [ __ ] out into the sunset
you know i i
volkswagen
dieselgate i don't care man the the the
golf gti i love the way it handles hills
you know you're just there's just a
brief window where you're good you're a
good person and it's certainly not nine
plus two plus tr plus two from two
verified streamers it's a blessed day
i'm not saying the kid did nothing wrong
by the way i'm just i'm more like
you know
he's nine
he's nine years old
you know i was nine like i was at a
sleepover um
there was my friend his house had a
fruit bowl they hadn't cleared it out in
a while there was a tangerine that was
like covered in blue mold i don't know
what i was doing i was nine this is one
of my best friends was sleeping i took
the tangerine through it full [ __ ]
force at his head
um from like 10 feet away
hit him right in the side of the cheek
and just a bunch of blue spores like
exploded out of it i didn't know that
was gonna happen but he didn't wake up
and i was just like
you know i was like let's go
[Laughter]
now should you know at age nine not to
do that
probably
but uh you're nine you just get you get
possessed by by instincts
not the [ __ ] your hub got this one
wrong
it's not about grabbing too much candy
it's about telling your son not to do so
so okay
your hub got this one wrong it's not
about grabbing too much candy it's about
you telling your son not to do something
and him screaming no literally nothing
about the punishment whatsoever
nothing about the severity of the
punishment you could have you know
chopped your kids hands off shouldn't
shouldn't have said no shouldn't have
said no
like that
so there's no gradient here it's just
like you know well you know okay if the
kid didn't want to
er
you know suffer the concert if you
didn't want to starve for three days he
shouldn't have said no on halloween like
i don't understand
these people have
just a very black and white view of the
world i think some of these comments are
strange cruel cut contact over candy
this was an entirely proportionate
consequence for poor behavior missing
out on candy on one occasion is not a
significant punishment is related to the
poor behavior and it immediately i.e
people g please people people g people
talk
this is entirely within the parameters
suggested by child behaviorists too many
children don't have parents or guardians
who care about them enough to set
enough
excuse me excuse me merriam-webster
i believe you've forgotten the word here
enough to set reasonable boundaries with
proportionate consequences like this
definitely you're not the [ __ ]
to which i say
that's what i say about that
don't care didn't ask plus you're named
like a super auto pets team okay that's
a personal attack i apologize suffice i
just don't like the rhetoric of this
post like first off some of these
comments are very strange
tell me they're strange you know like
like show me through the evidence don't
make an assertion cruel cut contact over
candy i didn't read any of those this is
a classic
argument reductio add down vodeo which
is when you say i can't believe that
there's people
in this thread saying thing and they're
down voted like [ __ ] minus 500 and
you're like yeah if you always like let
me give you a little lesson about how
social media works um if you always
spotlight the dumbest takes on planet
earth is going to make your argument
look strong to morons you know if you're
always like can you believe what this
one person can you believe what this one
person is doing in missouri right now
the whole country's like people are
doing this now no it's not people as one
person in missouri
you can't even tie their shoes half the
time and they're like can you believe
there's people doing this like you're
building it's the opposite of a straw
man it's like a it's like a tissue paper
man anyway why missouri hey someone's
got to be the butt of the joke okay
not the [ __ ] and it's not a
disproportionate punishment he's old
enough to know better source dude just
trust me and he was being rude to you i
think taking him home was great but it
needed the follow-up punishment or else
he may think he can end things for
everyone involved whenever he wants by
making him by misbehaving in public
a toddler gets taken home with no
additional punishment a nine-year-old
needs to understand when he is out he
needs to behave
so a toddler just if we're going by like
the grey's anatomy definition is like
you know between the ages of uh like one
and three
[Laughter]
so i at least i give him a little bit of
slack he doesn't want me to take my
one-year-old baby outside
trick-or-treating and then if she cries
be like all right sorry honey but now we
gotta give out your candy on the front
porch because you cried um
anyway it's just i don't know man it's
all
look all i'm saying is my and this is
unfair but i'm going to say it anyway
these are the kind of parents who would
be like making their kids smoke a whole
carton of cigarettes if they caught them
smoking when they were 12 years old
they'd be like he'll never smoke again
or he'll be addicted to it forever and
have like permanent
bronchitis but
like it's just not that
it's just not that bad man
you really had to get some it's not
psychological torture to make the kid
give out the candy to other kids it's
just kind of like
to me it reads like and this is where i
have some sympathy for the parent is
that reads like mom's kind of sick of
your [ __ ] now she's gonna get one over
on you which is
understandable
but then like when you're going to
reddit to be like tell me i did the
right thing
i'm like
that's where i think it goes a little
you got to keep that to yourself
anyway take me back
i just think i i don't think it's
horrible i just think it's a needlessly
vindictive and then in the comments
people are like you didn't go far enough
you should have tied his shoes together
when he wasn't paying attention and then
taking him to the longest staircase in
the city
am i the [ __ ] for leaving my
husband's grandmother
so just to run the math here this lady's
like [ __ ] 80 plus
two stranded two hours from home after
she tricked us into attending a wedding
this is like the she's so tricky it's
like the grandma from hereditary man
mother-in-law and i used to have an okay
relationship we weren't as close or we
weren't close but she was always nice to
me
is his grandma the joker
tell me you haven't seen hereditary
without telling me you haven't seen
hereditary people are like are you
talking about uh
tony collette i'm not talking about tony
collette you peace
go watch the movie again
don't think you were paying attention
mother-in-law in law and i used to have
an okay relationship we weren't close
but she was always nice to me when we
got married three years ago we only have
plus ones two people
we only gave plus ones to people
on serious relationships which she was
not
you didn't give
your husband's mom a plus one
come on
like
can't you just live and let live why do
you gotta have this much control you're
really gonna audit every guest at your
wedding
to be like is that relationship serious
or not just give everybody plus ones
otherwise you're creating like a cast
system at your own wedding
sorry i didn't get a plus one i know you
don't need your plus one is it possible
that i could pay you for your plus like
what are you non-fungible invites
like what are you doing
you gotta set up like a secondary
auction house for the the limited amount
of plus ones
i'm losing it man it's not even we're
not even into the post yet
which she was not she fought with me
about the plus ones



the rumors of react court's demise are
greatly exaggerated here we are sorting
by the best posts of the month some of
these we have seen like would i be the
[ __ ] for suing a customer for
damaging an extremely valuable item
uh
have you consider i forgot this is the
one where she had the audacity to take a
selfie inside of a store
um
we i think we also saw this one we i we
did not see this one though oh and it's
removed okay well never mind
scroll down 21 days ago i can't remember
the last time we did react court am i
the [ __ ] for telling my ex that his
runaway 16 year old niece was staying
with me
even after
she begged me not to tell her family
where she is all right
that seems a little scary
also not enough info
uh no they i'm looking at the results it
seems like most people thought there was
enough info
[Laughter]
my ex's 16 year old niece greta
showed up to my house unexpectedly set
up a a bio
degradable composter started yelling at
us about our carbon footprint because we
were uh
buying foods without skating the bar
code to see where they originally
uh originated good one good one we could
have also done greta van fleet started
uh coming into my house uh
literally sounding exactly like led
zeppelin but without the same
songwriting chops and then
you know everybody that you went to high
school with is like whoa they're the new
led zeppelin because they sound the same
so true so true
uh anyway she told me she was tired of
living with her family and needed
somewhere to stay for a few days before
she was going to find a way to fly back
to where her friends and boyfriend lived
her friend showing up
wait her showing up was a huge shock
because me and her uncle are currently
in the middle of a divorce and haven't
been together for over two years and in
that time i've had no contact with her
it was the middle of the night so i
agreed to let her stay for the time
being and i offered to speak to her
family for her but she begged me not to
she told me if i told her family she
would leave and never speak to me again
all right
before we get
into this i always like to make a
judgment on incomplete information that
sometimes vindicates me and sometimes
makes me look like an idiot in the
future
but
i feel like if you have your 16 year old
niece like i'm trying to put myself in
the shoes of the op here one of my
nieces in like six years came over and
was like
you know my home is unsafe
uh
then
i might i mean i would probably try to
talk to
the parents nonetheless
uh but like that's a different story
than her coming and saying i'm kind of
tired of living with my family like yeah
no way like you're 16 years old of
course you're tired of living with your
family you've been living there for 16
years
that's that's like you're at that weird
intersection of like slowly being able
to like have
divergent interest from your parents but
also not even coming close to like the
capability
of you know being able to provide for
yourself yet
so it's an awkward time for sure
like if it's an abusive household which
does not appear to have been mentioned
but it could be true i'm not gonna
project that but then that's a different
story than just like i'm kind of sick of
it anyway
also like i maybe i'm not a um
i'm an only child i don't have any
siblings right
but i kind of feel like if i did
i would want to see the closeness
of like you know i i feel like my
relationship with my
sibling
takes precedent over their relationship
with my kid
like i i would feel very offended
again if this is just a situation where
she's tired of living at home
if
my brother or sister was like yeah don't
worry about it i'm definitely not gonna
tell my uh my brother who is your father
that you're here i'm just going to let
you run away instead
anyway
it's oh there's i mean it's her ex's
niece
now i know i'm even like for dude it
then
i weirdly enough even though it's like a
further relationship i'm like you're not
even just without being rude
you're not even part of the family
anymore
that's one of those you just got to dump
that on to the uh
onto the relevant parties and then like
change your locks or something like that
you you that's something where you serve
as like you're the receptionist for this
drama you pass it to your
ex-husband
and then you just get on with your life
this is not relevant to you anymore imo
at least
she told me if i told her family she
would leave and never speak to me again
don't threaten me with a good time now
here was the issue i have a
four-year-old son who facetimes his dad
almost every day and basically gives him
a play-by-play of every little thing
that's happened to him since their last
call there was no way he wasn't going to
mention it since he was super excited
when he saw greta i tried explaining
this to greta but she kept threatening
to leave if i spoke to her uncle oh yeah
that seems like a it's a totally normal
situation
hitting your ex-aunt with an ultimatum
that if your four-year-old son lets it
leak that she's staying there you'll
never speak to her again
like this is what i'm again i don't know
what's going on in the 16 year old's
life okay but when people are like i
feel like she wouldn't run away for no
reason look this is a it's not exactly
when people are at like their most
rational in their lives you know
that
is
clearly she's maybe not being totally
fair in the situation
for a few days it was fine because my ex
kept cancelling because he had an
emergency he needed to deal with in that
time i kept trying to convince greta to
change her mind and asked her for a
better explanation on why she had run
but she wouldn't open up to me she just
kept saying she wanted to go home the
next time my ex called i went into
another room and explained that greta
was here because i felt it was better to
hear it from me than our son and it was
also better for me because i didn't want
to risk our divorce turning hostile over
this he told me not to tell her that i
had told him and that someone would be
there soon to take her home that was a
huge s show
greta told me she hated me and i ruined
her life as she was escorted home then
my ex showed up a few hours later and he
chewed me out for not telling him
immediately am i the [ __ ]
kind of
so there's there's a lot to tease apart
here
first off
i've had like a hell of a
four or five day period
um
and this is so complicated and dramatic
that it makes me feel like i'm living in
you know like an episode of the most
boring show of all time
it's fantastic like i'm so thankful that
my life is not as interesting as ops is
because this is just it just seems
highly exhausting
so the first thing i'll say
is maybe this sucks for op
but
your 16 year old ex-niece
saying that she hates you and you ruined
her life because you did something that
you felt was responsible and in her best
interest welcome to the [ __ ] game
that's just that's the price you pay for
knowing a teenager i think
i don't mean to be rude okay i was a
teenager once i thought i was thinking
rationally about everything did not
necessarily end up computing that way
once you look back on it but like
there's a reason that you know we don't
let 16 year olds
vote or like you know
rent a car we could let them drive their
mom's you know
jeep liberty or whatever
unsupervised that's no big deal because
it was only like you know 3 500 pounds
or whatever capable of driving like 90
miles an hour but
i'm just saying
there's no
they're not the most rational people in
the world you didn't ruin our life like
how like what do you mean you ruined her
life
just because she has to go yeah
look
there's no way this doesn't come across
as like a uh
a boomer take don't get me wrong but i'm
like wait you're 16 years old what is it
did it ruin your life when like you know
batman vs superman came out you were so
excited for it forever for like eight
months from when you found out about it
and then it kind of sucked and you're
like my life is over it's not over
you're gonna go to college you're gonna
forget that this stuff ever happened
again given the information that we have
available here
i can't i can't
gain anything from this that is not
written into the post okay
um
and then the snyder cut came out and it
saved me
so that i'm just like ah get over it um
greta told me she hated me and i ruined
her life and she was escorted home okay
who cares
not to be rude then my ex showed up a
few hours later and chewed me out for
not telling him immediately am i the
[ __ ] i do kind of feel like
i don't think she's like look if this
assuming the story is real op was faced
with a difficult situation they took
some time to deliberate or at least kick
the can down the road
they're kind of an [ __ ] for like you
know being in custody of a minor and not
letting her family know right away
like considering you you got to put
yourself in the mindset of the parents
as well who we can't assume necessarily
did anything heinous they must have had
like a terrible 48 72 hours you know
trying to figure out where their
daughter was and you know running
through their head that she's probably
been murdered somewhere you know what i
mean
so i could totally see why op would be
an [ __ ] here um
even if she didn't ask for the situation
to to be on her doorstep no matter what
yeah maybe that's why
her i don't mean to laugh but maybe
that's why her ex-husband kept having to
cancel sorry sorry son i can't facetime
today i'm dealing with the potential uh
kidnapping or murdering of my niece uh
wouldn't that that's like some gift of
the magi stuff right
you know she's
it sounds like the problem was like
self-regulating so i mean i don't know
what what do you mean is everybody sucks
here who's who's the other person that
sucks though
i mean i guess denise
i definitely don't disagree that the
niece is
putting her in an awkward position but
the x what's wrong with the x man
the four-year-old well you know he's not
exactly a steel trap
he's a he seems like he's a bit of a
snitch but he is four you know
okay well anyway the final verdict is
not enough info but also the final
verdict is actually
not the [ __ ]
47 percent
oh yeah okay chat one moment please i'm
just gonna i'm gonna help my wife out
with something here and then we'll go
read the comments okay see you in a
second
all right i'm back i'm back
sharing mike stream
i don't know i look dude i'm good i
think most people kind of understand
where i'm coming from on this one but i
do it's so annoying to read comments
that are like it sounds like nl's not
even considering that like abuse is a
possibility this is react court not
react gossip you know if something is
not admitted as evidence i'm not gonna
be like hey it sounds like your parents
are probably hitting you so not the
[ __ ] right like i can only
read a judgment on what's actually
placed in the post in the first place
otherwise you just become like a is like
a dictatorship where you put your own
head canon into every issue
you know you could also assume her
parents are actually awesome but the
kid's just a little bit of an idiot and
is running away because she's just you
know her brain is so [ __ ] up on like
teenage chemicals and you know
increasing autonomy and responsibility
and
the inevitable opening up of adult life
that happens to everybody as well
happens all the time
too too much damn taurine exactly
because the the white monsters man
maybe her boyfriend is elon musk we have
we could just make up whatever we want
exactly
anyway let's let's see what kind of
insanity we get to in the comments i
mean most people said not the [ __ ]
info why is greta running away
i mean we did say this if she's leaving
a stable home to go live with a deadbeat
boyfriend you could be a massive [ __ ]
for helping her if she's fleeing an
abusive situation you're an [ __ ] for
taking steps you know would return her
that's absolutely true
there's nothing wrong with it judge
judea
what a great name this is my my well if
if you're the judge judy of am i the
[ __ ] then i have to be i don't even
know like i guess i'll be judge mathis
hello um you do realize that the
emergency was his missing niece i do
think you're in the wrong for not
telling them sooner but obviously not
the [ __ ] for telling them
yeah
okay
judge mills lane judge joe brown i know
many judges
not the [ __ ] i agree with your ex
though she's a 16 year old runaway take
her in to keep her safe but her parents
are worried sick not the [ __ ]
unless they are legally emancipated it
is a crime in most states to harbor a
runaway this may suck but you are
required to tell the parents or tell the
police that you are providing the child
sanctuary that's another thing actually
that i didn't consider
normally i hate when people are like oh
it's a crime it's a crime because i'm
like you know that's
sometimes that's valid but like also
you know sometimes it's like you know
you i think you gotta there's the spirit
of being like a good person
that if the cops aren't involved takes
precedence over the law you know what i
mean
like when i was
12
it was
new year 2000 you know y2k new
millennium i was 12 years old my parents
were like hey
you should have a little sip of
champagne
and i was like what
are you crazy
like that's i'm that's wha it's illegal
and they were like it's the new
millennium you're only gonna like live
through new millennium once and i was
like
i don't want to anyway i did it tasted
like poison
what they did was illegal
but at the same time i look back on it
as a fond and and funny memory you know
and i i think that's why you can't live
your whole life equating necessarily
morals and ethics with the letter of the
law
that's actually legal
well
tell that to their probation officer um
but i mean
they're not chad's not gonna like this
one okay but if there was
if there was a situation where you
thought maybe abuse was a an issue and
as a result you were not comfortable
telling the parents
you could also get the police involved
and be like i don't exactly know what's
going on here
you guys sorted out i don't think that
that's gonna be the most popular take on
the internet i'm just saying
you you could as well that's another
option
everybody sucks here i assume a 16 year
old is it is a minor where you are
greta put you in an untenable position
by turning up like this and you had a
duty to let her parents and guardians
know where she was had she raised issues
of abuse you should contact the police
or social services you shouldn't have
accepted a minor in your home without
anyone else knowing
your ex is an [ __ ] for behaving like
that
i'm i feel like i'm losing my mind here
what did the ex-husband do wrong
like he's the [ __ ] because he called
her an [ __ ] he's an [ __ ] because
he said he was mad
he yelled at her
did he yell at her
i don't know i kind of feel like to be
honest with you
if i and and again now i'm admittedly
projecting onto the i'm putting my own
head canon into this situation okay but
like
if i had been helping my
sibling deal with the disappearance of
their teenage daughter for like two or
three days and then my ex-wife was like
oh yeah she's been here the whole time i
would probably be like are you [ __ ]
crazy like you never thought over the
past two days when we were like
dealing with this [ __ ] for absolutely no
reason you could have just like let that
drop for a second so these people
weren't living in pure panic for the
last uh you know three or four days
just hypothetically speaking i think
it's a situation where being mad is
fairly reasonable
that sounds reasonable to me
you suck greta sucks your ex doesn't
suck
the fact you didn't mention it when it's
clear his emergency was he was dealing
with his missing niece makes you so
wrong even if you did tell him she
showed up in the middle of the night you
show her to your guest room go back to
bed call her parents as soon as
everybody wakes up that's what normal
people do you can't harbor a 16 year old
runaway
you need to call child protective
services rather than calling the family
if there's abuse a teenager was missing
her parents didn't know if she'd been
kidnapped traffic was safe with family
was on the streets or what and you stuck
your head in the sand waiting for
someone else apparently your
four-year-old to forcibly act for you
that's terrible well yes
frankly if i regret his parents i'd have
charged you criminally i don't can you
just do that what is the i mean
look
she did i really think she messed up i
don't know what kind of crime i guess
she was like a harboring
a runaway which maybe is a crime but
come on
can you do that
i don't know if you can just charge
people criminally for annoying you but i
feel like wait what you got to suck up
all these taxpayer dollars like just you
know eviscerate them socially and then
move on with your lives
anyway i think we've we've pretty much
milked this one it seems like
everybody's more or less on the same
page here
okay we got am i the [ __ ] for making
my son pass out the candy he got from
trick-or-treating we saw that last time
we saw that one last time how about this
one am i the [ __ ] for shaming my
in-laws after my mother-in-law told a
romantic story oh hold on i've gotten
i've gotten lost in the sauce i'm like
10 tabs deep here
this should be good anytime the
mother-in-law gets involved like
it's always interesting because it's not
your mom
like i even like so i told the story of
like um
like we got a just before bed last night
literally as we were getting ready to go
to bed kate looked at her phone and was
like oh my god
and she had i came over and she had
texts from her mom that was like her
it was said sos i'm in danger
her exact gps coordinates and then two
random photos that i'm sure it just took
with the front-facing camera uh that was
like a light fixture and the top of her
head so we were like oh my god she must
have like either she's been kidnapped or
she fell down she can't get up or
something so we called her she didn't
pick up we called
kate's dad he didn't pick up we called
kate's sister she didn't pick up and
we're like freaking out like we're
we're basically like five seconds away
from calling 9-1-1 and being like you
got to break down my mother-in-law's
door
and make sure she's okay or like start a
missing persons report or something
then thankfully it wasn't so late at
night that everybody was asleep kate's
mom
like saw that she had missed the call
from kate and was like oh yeah sorry
i sent that by accident
i i tried to cancel it but i guess it
went through
um apparently i didn't know this
apparently on samsung phones this is
what gamebot said but it kate also said
it's on iphone as well
um
if you tap
the lock button or press the lock button
three times in rapid succession it
starts a five second timer that is like
if you don't cancel this we're gonna
send two photos
and your gps coordinates to like
everybody on your contact list that
you've selected or something like that
um so that's what happened and even
though she was like
super in the wrong
it was a mistake but still i was like i
don't want to tweet this [ __ ] and put
kate's mom on blast she's family but
then i also had a little devil on my
shoulder that is like this is [ __ ]
funny man that's a great story so
i asked
my wife i said
would it be okay if i tweeted this and
she said yes
that would be fine and then she also
tweeted about it
so
i felt like that was a fair maybe this
isn't am i the [ __ ] situation for me
but i was like maybe at worst it's
everybody sucks here because i kind of
feel like after you maybe accidentally
send a message that's like i've been
kidnapped
um
you could maybe look at your phone and
be like
sorry that was a fat finger or something
instead of just letting it sit there for
like 30 minutes
that's just just for the future
imo i would say uh
we had the same very similar thing
happen um
like when my mom was staying here like a
year ago she headed back to her airbnb
and then she meant to type like text me
and say i'm inside but instead she sent
me
a
man inside
and then i was like what
and i called her and she was like oh
yeah it was a typo and i was like okay
have a good night
just like we got a
there needs to be like uh
a confirm like it reads that once you
get over the age of 50 is like it uh
like reads the text back to you and then
you have to say like your birthday or
something like that in order to actually
send the text
at least she didn't say man inside me i
mean honestly
on the spectrum of things i would rather
my mom be having an illicit affair than
go to her airbnb and get killed by
somebody that's hiding in her closet or
something like that neither would be
necessarily what i would choose for for
her fate but like in the whole scheme of
things that one of them is like really
bad the other one is cataclysmic
thank you thank you for the raid daniel
by the way we're just moving on to our
next story
oh
yeah i don't know like again i i i love
my parents but my mom does do that
sometimes where she's like can we call
tonight and i'm like oh yeah sure like
is 8 p.m okay
and then uh
like she calls me and she's like you
know
how's your day going and i'm like it's
going good but the message you sent me
was kind of like is anxiety inducing
like is everybody alive and well she's
like yeah i just wanted to talk
like you can't send the message that is
like can we call tonight or something
like that
because it it it leaves you simmering in
the anxiety the whole time
but anyway i i apologize
am i the [ __ ] for shaming my in-laws
after they told after my mother-in-law
told a romantic story i don't like my
in-laws i'll be honest we've always had
issues mother-in-law grew up wealthy and
as of right now i would classify them as
very wealthy full-blown rich but when
they got married her family disowned her
and they were poor for a little while
the one thing i actually find redeeming
in mother-in-law is that despite how
vain and materialistic she is she really
did love her husband more than the money
hey you gotta hand it to her
she married him for love
she loves money
that's the situation roast on donald
trump
comedy central 2013 mla reference
certified
on the other hand my biggest issue with
mother-in-law and father-in-law is that
they love each other way way more than
they love their kids and mother-in-law
actually looks down on me for
prioritizing my children and makes snide
comments that she feels bad for her son
honestly op sounds like a huge [ __ ]
like if if the mother-in-law was making
comments that she feels bad for
your son
that's bad
that's way over the line
if she feels bad for her own son that's
just like self-disparagement that's not
an insult to you
i don't understand
we were talking about christmas recently
and mother-in-law made fun of people who
don't like the materialism because
that's the best part she then told what
she clearly considered a sweet story
about how when they were poor
father-in-law worked extra shifts and
saved to buy her a diamond ring because
she didn't get an engagement ring my
father-in-law or my sorry my husband
made a joking comment about how he
probably didn't get anything that
christmas mother-in-law laughed and
admitted he got something from the
dollar store because she did the budget
and spent all the money on father-in-law
and father-in-law spent all the money he
saved on her ring
okay the husband is the son i understand
now she laughed like it was funny but i
didn't think it was and my kids looked
at me kind of confused because in our
house christmas is all about the kids
okay this is like
there's just difference
in in people's philosophies right now
there's nothing that crazy this seems
like a totally normal situation right
now
mother-in-law called me out on making a
face and i was honest and told her that
was pretty weird and in my world kids
get christmas presents first some years
my husband and i don't even exchange
gifts okay good for you what do you want
a medal that says like a normal person
mother-in-law got defensive and said my
husband can't even remember that year
but she can and said marriage is forever
kids leave and have new families i said
that i stood by what i said and
mother-in-law seemed upset she gets very
defensive about not being the greatest
mom and father-in-law said i was just
jealous because my husband wouldn't do
that for me all right that's kind of
over the line
it definitely made the mood weird and
when we left mother-in-law muttered that
i was making her look bad to my kids
which i don't think is true they are
just perceptive and curious and have
their own opinions of her
um
well i don't i don't want to say that
there's like more info required here
but i would say like if your kid was
like you know
three or younger
i think it kind of makes sense to blow
your christmas budget on a gift for your
spouse instead of on a gift for your kid
i mean you can get a you can make a
three-year-old kid's day
with you know
five bucks at the dollar store
you can get on like a you know a toy gun
a bunch of cups with jojo siwa's face on
them or something like that and you know
they'll though one of those weird little
sheriffs badges that smells like you
know
carcinogenic chemicals and stuff like
that and then they're having a great day
that's like a that's a good christmas
for them that's it's more about the
experience and then like just dude you
could later you can give a kid like a
stick and then like 10 seconds later
they're like mace windu right um
so i don't think i i think it's a little
crazy
crazy's not the right word it's a little
over the line for the op to be
criticizing like what might be
a 30 year old event
um
that honestly seemed like your husband
was just kind of like making a joke
about um that being said i think it's in
everybody sucks here just because the
father-in-law said
i
like i i guess i have to look at it
through like the husband's uh
perspective which is that your dad is
like
hey your wife is just jealous because my
son wouldn't do that for her i i would
feel like
maybe this is just the position i prefer
to be in is operating from a position of
weakness but it's like first off
christmas 1992 got [ __ ] up for me i
got like a can of star kiss tuna from
the dollar store my mom got a 3 000
diamond ring and then 30 years later i'm
also getting hit again because they're
like i bet you wouldn't do that for your
wife and you're like i didn't i'm
literally like the only innocent person
in this situation
the first story i was a kid and then the
second part of this i would just happen
to be here
like why am i getting
you know blasted i'm i'm like getting
hit in the crossfire because you guys
are having a fight
it's
doesn't make any sense
i i mean i think this isn't everybody
sucks here
hello sim viktor hello but this is like
this is i i don't even want to like
click on the comments here because this
is just like a normal situation
the only reason that this is like
everybody sucks here is because
i people are
i don't want to make a generalization
some people are unable to have
a disagreement
about anything with anybody without
turning it into an argument you know how
many times i'll be like eating dinner
with you know my in-laws and they'll say
some stuff that i like don't agree with
at all
i don't go oh so true
you know but you kind of you you you jit
kundo it you know you go well i can see
where you're coming from me personally
my philosophy is and then you like
eloquently wrap your opinion which might
be the exact opposite in the most
reasonable fabric possible and then lob
it back at them and see if you find
like common ground you don't just go
well 30 years ago you you [ __ ] up
christmas for your little kid or
something like i mean if you have a
difference about serious stuff don't get
me wrong but like
this is just like normal
people like don't have exactly the same
opinions and values it's not that big of
a deal
anyway it's just i mean most people are
reasonable i think
i don't agree with my in-laws about
everything we find some common ground
ignore the rest and then go okay you
know let's have some chili quiles or
something like that everybody agrees on
the chili chiles
oh something went wrong just don't panic
what the heck
the biggest internet website that
constantly goes down went down
i don't believe it
i'm panicking i'm panicking
okay i'm back
i've made it work i fixed it a team of
trained monkeys has been dispatched to
solve your problem
i this is i don't even know if i'm
capable of touching this one so let's do
it
see let's get spicy
am i the [ __ ] for telling my husband
he can't stay with his gay friends why
do i have the feeling that their
sexuality is not actually relevant here
and they're just kind of like um
you know
like
bad people
and it's like you put that in the
headline just to get some clicks or
something like that and then it's like
they had a dog that they let starve or
something like that
let's see
oh well i don't know maybe maybe not
we'll see it's a bit of an essay i met
my husband luke seven years ago when he
lived with his childhood best friend sam
sharing an apartment in nyc is this uh
500 25
600 minutes this is a play
when i first met sam he didn't seem to
like me very much he ignores me walks
away when i visit the apartment doesn't
smile doesn't respond if i ask a
question at first i thought he was gay
and maybe he had a crush on luke just my
instincts but luke assured me that he is
not and is just shy
a few months later
the third roommate moves out and sam
invites one of his friends will to take
the extra room will is bisexual and has
a friend john who is gay can i get
people g please
i'm gonna need some some people g here
there's a lot of there's this is why
when they have a musical every new
character gets a song
so you can be like oh yeah the marquito
lafayette that's the guy who raps in
french i remember
i didn't have any problems with this
situation until i felt they were openly
disrespecting my relationship there were
so many instances but but i will list a
few they always text luke calling him
baby and asking if he would go to events
with them without me
okay
is it kind of annoying
one time john started hitting on luke in
front of me touching his face etc and
said something like he could turn him
gay
another time john started touching luke
when they were working together and luke
asked him to stop
they all did nitrous together i wasn't
there
and john enacted a sexual emotion on
luke which supposedly made him super
uncomfortable so he left he told me
later yeah okay uh like
i'm gonna say not the [ __ ]
certainly the situation just sounds like
um your husband
was basic basically getting sexually
harassed in his home
over and over repeatedly by the people
he was supposed to trust the most
certainly seems like
it's i would say you are not the [ __ ]
here
given that i come from a highly
conservative background this made me
feel very weird let me stop you there
and i'm gonna i'm gonna jump on this
grenade for you
this doesn't have that much to do with
the highly conservative background i
think they're just not respecting
the man's boundaries and his
relationship
trust me it would be very easy to just
roll my eyes laugh at your comment farm
plus twos
i
if if i had less integrity we could be
just reaping gift subs right now
some kind of joke about uh
dick cheney i don't even know okay but
like yeah
it has nothing to do with your
background this is just like over the
line in general
i told him i didn't want to hang out
with his friends anymore i didn't tell
him not to but i made it clear that i
don't like john that combined with the
fact that luke and i were moving in
together when their lease was up they
thought he would renew it with them
upset these friends and they decided to
stop talking to him again don't threaten
me with a good time hey sub serial thank
you for the gifted subscriptions
we moved out
moved on and lost touch with them we got
married four years after that about two
years ago though we found out sam was in
fact gay and got married to will
all three of them are living together in
nyc
their best friend i think is is is megan
milali
deborah messing was also a big part of
the show we talked about it on monday i
think uh
with uh with sips and mouth
this this feels a little bit like a
sitcom
um
to make a long story short luke and i
you can't do that
you can't write like
three paragraphs and a numbered list and
then after that be like to make a long
story short but
luke and i moved to the uk last year
luke is visiting the usa now on a
personal trip he did not tell me where
he plans to stay in nyc until last night
when he mentioned he would be staying
with sam luke and john he said he asked
all his friends at nyc but only sam
could accommodate although it was the
first time he spoke with sam after all
these years this upset me i told him how
it weirds me out it makes me
uncomfortable then luke got upset with
me asking if i were worried he would
turn gay and have sex with them i got
upset and ended the conversation
i see how this story makes me seem
homophobic
but i am not believe it or not
i am just unhappy my husband is planning
to stay with these people who
disrespected me in my relationship i
told him if he wanted to get a coffee or
dinner with sam it's okay
but staying overnight makes me
uncomfortable am i in the wrong with how
i feel
i mean i
again i kind of feel like i'm
maybe uh
not on the majority side i don't feel
like she's
actually being unreasonable in the
slightest
i i i don't see like what what did she
do at all
that makes her an [ __ ] in this
situation
she's definitely homophobic i mean i
i don't get that vibe honestly
she did she write
people's sexuality out more times than
she needed to
probably
by like the eighth time that she was
like it turns out that sam was gay i was
like uh who cares you know i'm more
worried about the all the times they did
like whippets together and then you know
it came on to your husband to the extent
that it made him uncomfortable and there
is apparently like a recurring pattern
there like that's pretty bad
but i certainly don't i don't know it i
don't get the vibe from anything in the
post that she's homophobic necessarily
seems more like you know
he
lived with people who were kind of like
very disrespectful to him
over and over
um
and is uncomfortable with him staying
with them as a result like i
i don't know i don't think she's like
weird at all here
i think it's weird that her husband
wants to stay with them and i'm not in
you know trying to insinuate that you
know he's going to try to make romantic
overtures or anything like that i'm just
saying it's kind like he might just have
like some kind of stockholm syndrome
where he's like these guys are my best
friends but actually they're like we
hate this guy and treat him like crap
it's just weird
can't you just stay in a hotel or
something like that
you know i guess it's expensive don't
get me wrong but you [ __ ] lived in
new york city so what'd you expect
you die you know you go to california
and never see a burrito restaurant like
you lived in new york city you're
traveling in new york city you didn't
think you'd have to spend a little bit
of money
i'm not sure about that they're just
straight that's beside the point don't
get me wrong but the same time
all right let's read the comments these
comments are going to be insane
there's absolutely no doubt about it
not the [ __ ] they openly disrespected
you i would say the same as you yeah
agreed not the [ __ ] not the [ __ ]
not the [ __ ]
they're not that insane actually most of
these are pretty rational
not the [ __ ]
i mean this is true if he's not gay he's
not going to become gay it sounds like
he has some immature friends who he
wants to catch up with they might have
changed it doesn't really matter if you
trust him you trust him that being said
like i i agree with this obviously but
like
still these people were like they they
crossed the line
many times
i don't know like i i see this less as
the issue of like you know
can your husband catch up with his
friends and more as the issue like you
know
i don't want my
partner
going to hang out with some people who
kind of like
i don't know bullied them or something
like that that makes sense
like
people can change sure but there's also
like you know seven billion
people
on the planet
instead of meeting
you know people from your life who like
wronged you in the past
you could just instead be like i'm going
to meet some new people or something
i don't know man
at first i was leaning towards not the
[ __ ] but after reading your responses
you're the [ __ ] you're purposely
trying to victimize your husband to fit
your narrative look i can't comment on
that i haven't seen all her comments now
i gotta go through like uh i i gotta go
to exhibit like the appendices of the
book now he wants to go he's a grown man
he's capable of making his own decisions
i'm not homophobic but brings in
conservative background for no reason
and look you can't necessarily just
because she said she was raised in a
conservative household doesn't mean she
was homophobic i mean
is there maybe a correlation there
i don't know i'm not a demographer i
can't make a statement in confidence i
might have a hunch but
nothing in her post
says that she's homophobic
at least from what i could glean
i think people there is that people
sometimes i want him or want her to seem
homophobic because it makes the judgment
much easier to pass but i don't think
that's the case
anyway this is like not as spicy
as i thought it would be i love these
comments that are written written like
tweets like you can just imagine the
clap emojis after everything
you're not wrong for feeling whatever
you're feeling you're not wrong for
demanding your husband feel the same as
you anytime you see this coming you know
that like the end of this is gonna be
like [ __ ] you go die
a hundred percent
anytime you get complimented two times
at the start of a comment like this you
know you're about to get hit with an
uppercut at the end
if he truly felt uncomfortable being
anywhere near them after being assaulted
then he would have never thought of
contacting one of them and staying with
them you're feeling uncomfortable
because they didn't like you that's
valid making your husband uproot his
plans because you're unhappy not so much
it's been years
years
years
which is why we've gotta stop replying
to o.j simpson insinuating that he
killed his wife all those years ago it's
been
decades
get over it he's he's a great tweeter
i think we should bring him on to the
joe exotic case
it's been years
if he got over it enough to not care
about being anywhere near them you
should too you're married they're
married the fact that all three live
together might even point to them having
a poly relationship but don't take my
word for it okay then don't put it in
the post
you don't get paid by the word this is
also about trust you should trust your
husband enough to not do drugs and not
cheat if you don't then you should
reevaluate your entire wedding
you're the [ __ ]
it's just like
maybe
i'm like two 1950s pilled
i don't think that's the case but i'm
willing to entertain the possibility but
like this post to me is like
never
ask your partner to do anything you can
literally you can never have a problem
with anything that your partner does
because you trust them right
so like even if your partner was gonna
do some like really messed up if they
were gonna go like skydiving without a
parachute what you don't trust them
i don't understand like
you married them
certainly you sign off on like
absolutely every action they take if you
ever have an issue with them you're
trying to keep them from spreading their
wings and flying like of course you can
have disagreements with people and you
could be uncomfortable with some of the
actions that they're gonna take like the
the idea like you know it's about trust
you should okay you should trust your
husband enough to not do drugs and not
cheat but i don't think that's what
she's doing i think she's like maybe you
shouldn't you know
go spend the night with people who don't
respect your boundaries
and maybe do some whippets with them uh
and and you know one of the guys was
saying he could turn you that's not even
the issue it's more that they cross the
line
that has he said he walked out earlier
it's about boundaries read the next
comment
oh lord
also just read your comments
and i realized how disgusting of a
person you really are okay to be fair
we need to know what other comments they
read before we
say that this is over the line
saying [ __ ] like you wouldn't be ready
to deal with him if your husband came
back and told you he'd been assaulted is
disgusting for his sake i hope he reads
your replies and realizes how horrible
you are that's so horrible and thinking
your post is fake what the actual hell
right i mean there's probably some
degree of fairness there
the message is the tone is a little bit
incendiary um
you're the [ __ ] completely wow you
are the definition of homophobic since
the fold part means fear
i don't think i could think of a lot of
stuff that's like more homophobic than
what this lady is doing here
it's getting a little crazy man
i'm straight i have gay friends i would
have no hesitancy about spending the
night in any of their houses because i
am not gay yeah but like what if they uh
you know three years ago
sexually harassed you to the point where
you left the house
that might change your opinion on
staying with them
it's just my two cents i kind of feel
like the
sexuality doesn't matter that much
it's more the fact that they didn't you
know respect you enough to not you know
treat you like a like a piece of meat
i'm sorry i forgot that was years ago
i don't know i just kind of i guess i
take an issue with the idea that that
people are like you know
i mean i get that people can change
don't get me wrong but i'm also like
just because
it's the same thing like you know it you
ever have like someone that was rude to
you in high school try to like add you
on facebook or something like that
and you know back when i had facebook
when i was like
uh looking at people adding me on
facebook like that you're like i bet
they've changed you know high school
ended
seven eight years ago i bet their life
has uh taken a different path maybe they
want to reconcile but also [ __ ] off
uh like we knew each other for a few
years just because of the fact that we
happened to live in the same catchment
for our high school you kind of treated
me like garbage now for some reason you
want to catch up and i don't know make
amends sorry you don't get to have like
the priority for that i hit the decline
button i don't really care that you
changed quite frankly i'm you know
it's not like i'm harboring a lot of ill
will around that but at the same time
i'm not like
you know let's uh reconcile to make you
feel better i'm like i was just happy
you're pretending that you didn't exist
that's pretty much it
yeah it's like you know that that's
their own issue to deal with okay i'm
being told to read
the all of their posts okay
to see if
that i should be um
let me look at their comments and this
may provide me with more context they
have a lot um oh my god
okay just i am civil too to me your
comments seem to come from someone with
low intelligence so
he can afford a call come with these
dude i just went to bad for you come on
he can afford a hotel he has over 1
million in net worth this is so bad man
i guess i'm afraid they would assault
him my fear is them assaulting him like
the nitrous incident
okay
my fear is that he would be assaulted
but i know he's not my child
we have a four-month-old son
i mean people are saying read her
username okay her username is throwaway
gay friends i feel like you need to take
that in context look it sounds really
bad out of context but also people make
throwaway accounts they put throwaway
plus the conditions of the post next to
it she's not suggesting that you take
these people and throw them in the
garbage can
it's a throwaway reddit account it's a
burner
it's not she's not saying you know throw
her throw his roommates in the garbage
it okay it is funny
it's look it still sounds bad but with
context it's at least
you know there's a a rational defense
for it
plus have you considered he has over 1
million in net worth
i mean okay
some of the posts are like
they're bad don't get me wrong
i don't know i maybe this isn't
everybody sucks here
i think it's also like maybe
again maybe i'm stuck in the 1950s
or maybe i am stuck in what i think that
the 1950s is like
but like i also i'm like her husband
sucks pretty hard
like you have a four-month-old kid
you're going on an overseas trip and
you're like let's go hang out with these
i'm not saying they're gonna do whippets
okay
but like you know it sounds like it's
gonna be a little bit of a party i don't
know i'm not saying you can't go on a
trip or something like that but you got
a four-month-old kid like you gotta you
gotta be around man
oh there's a bit of a spicy one
i forgot about this one am i the [ __ ]
for leaving my husband's grandmother
stranded two hours from home after she
tricked us into attending a wedding that
was a pretty good one
that was a classic
if he's gonna do whippets with anyone
i'd rather be his friends
i just i i i think the comments like a
little bit of a joke but it's like
something you say about like a like a 17
year old kid
i just want him to be safe if he's gonna
do it i'd rather he do it here this
guy's like he's got a child
he's got a like a four-month-old kid
he's probably you know in his 30s if
he's got to do whippets
i just hope he does it in a safe place
can't you just
sneakily fill your garage mini-fridge
with an endless supply of uh lagers and
then go out and say you're going to work
on the car drink like six to seven beers
a night dispose of the cans uh as
clandestinely as possible and then
refill it before anybody notices that
any of them are missing like a normal
person like that's just you know you
don't have to do uh
you know nitrous in manhattan like um
you don't have to be that fancy about it



mind the [ __ ] for telling my wife it
would be controlling and inappropriate
for her to try to change how my family
does christmas
i'll
maybe this makes me petty
i love people who
are way too into christmas
it's just it's not a personality defect
it just seems to lead to all of these
like completely preventable situations
that are like you know he
took the garland down
before we brought the turkey out onto
the table
anyway here we go
i told you i'd bring this screen back
that was
going to be some spicy youtube comments
on that first he defended the parents
for abusing that child that only the
abuse only exists in my head legally
speaking and then he sided with liz
cheney
he said the gay people shouldn't be
allowed to have friends
not true
not true
am i the [ __ ] for telling my wife it
would be controlling and inappropriate
for her to try to change how my family
does christmas
my wife and i rotate who we spend
christmas with so one year her family
one year my family i don't love doing it
with her family and she isn't a big fan
of my mother please don't tell us to do
it as a nuclear family we both hate that
idea our families are pretty different
i'm going to stop you right there
it's a post written by somebody who has
no real problems
this is a totally normal situation why
are you trying to build it up into some
kind of dramatic issue
your families don't really get along
they would rather have their own i mean
it's gotta happen at some point right
like multiple families come together
like you got two parents they have three
kids
their kids get married they have kids of
their own those kids get married like at
some point you can't have like a 900
person christmas like if you go two
generations three generations four
generations down you'd have to rent out
like you know wembley stadium just to
fit everybody at some point you gotta
cut
like at a at a logical line and this
will be one christmas this will be
another christmas
anyway
this is totally normal
her family is much more about the kids
even the dinner is tailored to what the
kids like bland in my opinion but i
would never say that the kids each get 1
000 gifts and spend christmas running
around my mother-in-law's house making a
huge ruckus that must be hard for you
christmas with my family is amazing food
though we usually have to pack our
toddler her own meal a more relaxed
atmosphere and my mom doesn't get any of
her grandkids gifts i don't know her
exact reasoning she said that only the
nuclear family should buy gifts though
she does get me and my two sisters
something but gives it to us about a
week in advance my kids don't know that
she does that my mom encourages the kids
to play in another room so the adults
can talk but me and my wife put our foot
down because the kids are just too young
to be clear we exchange gifts at home
before going my wife
finds it really weird that no one in the
family buys for other people's kids it
has nothing to do with my mom being
frugal my mom and step dad go all out
for each other
okay
again totally
i mean can i say that this is kind of
for me this is kind of based
i always find it weird when i go to like
my big family christmas and like my
uncle who i have like a two-minute
conversation with once a year is like
here's a 20 gift certificate to indigo
and then i gotta be like you know here's
a 20 gift certificate to foot locker
right like it's it's a weird perfunctory
gesture that you do
just to be like i know you're alive and
you were related so we like you know get
things for
each other and
you know even the same like
i i like uh for the kids maybe it's a
little different
you i you should get your grandkids
gifts probably but i'm also like i don't
know
the giving gifts just by obligation it
doesn't like it's not so i'm not gonna
make a reddit post about it or something
like that but i'm like oh you know
whatever
if somebody if if my daughter was like
you know i mean we don't have to worry
about that because i my mom is gonna
give our daughter so many gifts that i'm
gonna have to probably tell her to stop
i if i had to guess but like if we were
in the opposite situation or she was
like you know hey why does you know
great uncle uh whatever i'm not i know
his name i'm just not gonna say it but
like why doesn't great uncle you know
timothy get me a gift i'd be like cause
he's never seen you
in person
[Laughter]
he's only seen photos of you i don't i
don't feel that just because we had a
baby now he should be on the hook for a
50 gift certificate for the next 18
years like that's this like 900 bucks
just because we made a decision to start
a family like this
i i don't have a problem explaining that
if that's the way we choose to go but so
i anyway it doesn't matter like whatever
opinion you however you celebrate
christmas is totally fine now let's get
to the part where you start screaming at
each other for no reason
anyway it is our year to do christmas
with my side my my wife came to me and
proposed suggestion to the family we
only buy for kids and make christmas
more kid friendly i told her she has no
right to tell my mom how to spend her
money and that would not go over well
with my very child free sister
other sister has kids as well she said
she feels christmas is supposed to be
this magical time for the kids and my
mom and stepdad and child free sister
and brother-in-law have their
anniversaries birthdays and valentines
to spoil each other see she said she
just really hates how much christmas is
about the adults in my family and it
makes her sad
i said her points are totally valid okay
wife guy spotted that's that's a good
comment
normally in a reddit post this is where
that like instead of i said her points
are valid
what you see in that sentence there is
like i just started seeing red and i
couldn't handle it anymore so i walked
out and told her just enjoy whatever you
want to do
am i the [ __ ] so this is much more
reasonable so far
but it would be controlling and
inappropriate to try and change how my
family has always done things and she
would definitely offend my mom she said
i'm putting my mom's feelings ahead of
hers and she just wants to bring it up
and she doesn't like that i use the word
controlling am i the [ __ ] um here's
what i always say
i i think this isn't like a nobody sucks
here this is a no [ __ ]
first off
one of the reasons that is a no [ __ ]
is because
this is not a big deal at all like
literally
nobody cares
like for all of the discussion behind
the scenes
the kids are just gonna go there they're
gonna like you know
eat some food apparently amazing food by
the way
and then they're going to run around and
play like some stupid game that they
made up
one of the kids is probably going to
trip over like a loose cord because the
place isn't child proof it's going to
hit their head on like you know some
crown molding there's going to be a
brief moment of panic do we need to go
to the er do we not need to go to the er
and then everybody's going to go home
that's the way that the holidays go
you see nobody's going to be that
concerned about all this behind the
scenes setup and stuff like that
crown molding is on the ceiling look i
don't know anything about the home
improvement
yeah kids are kids they just like they
have fun doing nothing you know um
but i also feel like if you want to make
your christmas like about the kids
you can't really make it about like the
kids but you can make it about your kid
instead of going to you know the family
christmas and and giving your kid like a
bunch of gifts why like the day before
family christmas why you just do it up
for your kid if you if that's what you
want to do
that's
i feel like that's a very reasonable
solution now it's time because this
story is so boring it's time for me to
make myself the [ __ ] which is i have
never seen in my life i think a comment
that is funnier than this
i admit
wholeheartedly i have an incredible bias
as somebody who has a child especially a
young child
but one of the funniest things for me is
when like adults my age
complain about
things being tailored for kids
don't get me wrong
i would be annoyed if you could never
have
r rated movies or something like that
you know you could never the breaking
bad couldn't get made because you know
sesame street was on every channel
but like for one day a year to like go
to a dinner and be like it's a little
bland so the kids can enjoy it
can't you just enjoy
the the holidays like one of the best
parts of the holidays being that instead
of every parent looking after every
child
the kids are kind of looking after each
other so you guys can actually have an
adult conversation
uh you know
for the first time in six months
like that was the best part of being
with the in-laws for thanksgiving this
year
did we have a lot of situations where
kids were running around uncle ryan
uncle ryan can you show me how to play
ghost game yeah of course
but also
like more than i've ever been able to do
since the birth of my child i got to you
know sit at a at an adult table with
adults
have a conversation about adult stuff
and then look to the side now and then
and be like everybody's safe like i
don't need to
be so hands on a hundred percent of the
time so like the idea that you're like
oh christmas but the food is kind of
bland i'm like come on man
and the same thing like uh
you know
we will make christmas more kid-friendly
she has no right to tell my mom and that
would not go over very well with my
child free sister okay well like your
child free sister presumably she's an
adult she's you know gone through
challenges in her life can she just
[ __ ] like get over it and not cry
like a little [ __ ] because a kid's
getting the present where's my present
you know
just relax
who cares
you you you really i i'm not going to
assume that his sister is going to be
upset but he seems to be assuming that
it's a little bit
of a an assault on your sister
you know to to just assume that if she
sees a little kid getting christmas
presents she's gonna be like where is my
present
you're an adult like i'm not saying you
shouldn't also be able to enjoy
christmas but if if seeing a little kid
get a christmas present makes you
jealous of the child you gotta
sort that [ __ ] out you gotta chill
that's that's insanity
if you're in a grown adult and seeing uh
uh like your niece or your nephew
getting the present bothers you you have
a like a serious problem
it's just very weird to me
i mean it does say she is very child
free which i don't know that's like you
got like negative two kids or something
like that
i don't know how that happens but
anyway
it's just
[Laughter]
it's just weird man
i i
it's i don't know i i don't know if i'm
the only per like there's people who are
like i'm never going to have kids and
i'm like that's totally cool
i don't know like if any of my like it's
just is like me and dan
me and dan are out here
you know talking to each other about
dad's stuff i don't know if anybody else
that is like in my peer group will ever
have a child ever that's their own
personal business but like oh sorry sips
absolutely true
that's my mistake
but come on he's only got three kids dan
has three okay yeah anyway i was i don't
know i was just trying to find a way out
um
either way though
like if if i was
you know hanging out with corey
and like you know we were hanging out at
my place and like my daughter was there
and he was getting annoyed by the fact
that like i don't know my daughter was
making noise or something like that i
would be like you gotta grow the [ __ ] up
just to be honest
like
it's just
don't get me wrong there's yeah i think
it people
don't realize that like
there's a very like charmed section
of life
when you don't have a kid
none of your family members are like
young kids or or have young kids and
like none of your friends have kids
where you can be like let's go out for
dinner at 10 pm
let's go to a cool place where they only
they don't even have tables you just sit
at the bar like blah blah blah that's a
great part of life don't get me wrong
but like as you get older you might have
to like for
six hours a year be in the same room as
a child
i kind of expect you to get over that um
because you're an adult and sometimes
being an adult means you don't get to
have absolutely everything perfect for
your exact standards and principles
24 7 365. sometimes you gotta be like eh
you know
kids make noise
[Laughter]
get over it you know
it's just
maybe this is too much of a boom or take
but i'm like in the real world yeah
sometimes you know your kid's gonna be
there
you know something i'm not just saying
like my kid like we do the best that we
could possibly do to not inconvenience
other people but with the existence of
our child but you know if you're in your
30s and you're like man there's a kid
here having fun then i'm like okay
[ __ ]
get in a time machine you know go back
to 1939 and we'll all
you know participate in operation market
garden instead if you don't want to do
that let's just [ __ ] relax and
realize that a kid going ah
like for five minutes you can just get
over it okay you'll just go home do
whatever you want day drink
you know watch eight hours of football
you can do that literally
like 52 weeks a year
i don't know how long the nfl season is
probably like 20 weeks but still
schedule it's not a big deal
seven well it's not 17 weeks unless your
team never makes the playoffs jets fan
spotted
jets fan spotted
anyway
i don't care if you're like
i'm just laughing there's just like one
person in chad who's saying like wrong
wrong wrong over and over and i was like
i don't know if you're of the opinion
that i don't read the username part of
the post and i only see the text of the
post but i know it's your name over and
over so if you're trying to like
gaslight me into thinking that there's a
lot of disagreement here
then uh it's falling on deaf ears
instead i'm just seeing your post over
and over wrong wrong a-tier gamer f-tier
judge wrong he doesn't live in the real
world why is he so off today blah blah
like i see it okay
you gotta like maybe change your color
between every post and then i won't see
it but
you know you're just
typing it over and over
plus you fell off plus you're bald
i don't know dude like i again i don't
really have like a problem with well at
all if somebody doesn't want to have
kids
literally doesn't bother me at all i
feel like they position themselves as
child free because they have people in
their lives that are like when are you
gonna have grandkids for me and i'm like
that's not me i literally
don't really care at all as long as you
know you leave me alone and don't talk
to me but it just it becomes annoying
when somebody's personality is like i
hate kids and then whenever you're like
hey it's just a little kid can you like
get over it they're like oh sorry i care
about the climate crisis
and i'm like do you because
you you drive a jeep discovery so like
i'm just asking you to put your uh money
where your mouth is
really really you care about the climate
crisis that's why you're not gonna have
a kid
because i thought that like you and your
wife took like 17 flights in the last
six months but what do i know that's
different that's that was for work
that's different the car if it's for
work the carbon doesn't hit the the many
people are saying the carbon doesn't get
captured if it's for work
the greenhouse gases they just nobody
knows what happens they just go
oh you love the climate okay well i
guess i won't see you at uh bit summit
in japan this year you've been flying
from sfo to osaka for the last uh 10
years running
the plane would have been flying anyway
sorry sorry miami and okay anyway i'm
going too far
i'm going too far anyway i don't think
anybody's the [ __ ] the story is just
kind of like boring
am i the [ __ ] for not having sympathy
for my wife
when my in-laws found out my parents are
still married
am i the [ __ ]
for not having sympathy for my wife
when my in-laws found out my parents are
still married
am i
the [ __ ]
for not having sympathy for my wife
for not having sympathy for my wife
when her parents
found out my parents are still married
i
am
sorry
i
i understand the title i think i just
don't understand why
i i just don't understand why i guess
i absolutely love my wife and in pretty
much no contact with my parents due to
my mom speaking poorly of my wife
attempting to hijack our wedding and
being passive-aggressive my dad is kind
of useless and admits he only had me to
make my mom happy since i'm not
currently making her happy he has no use
of me what the [ __ ]
am i the [ __ ] for having literally
the worst parents of all time
my mom is a spoiled princess to the
1000th degree and my dad likes it that
way
source dude just trust me is my guess on
that one but
we see them maybe once or twice a year
at a holiday dinner
my wife hates my mom for her general
[ __ ] but mostly for pulling the
princess act at our wedding
my mom had an anniversary party and the
white dress i wouldn't let her wear to
the wedding
what the [ __ ] are you talking about my
mom had an anniversary party in the
white dress i wouldn't let her wear to
the wedding if anybody needs proof of
how crazy she is
there's like there's no context for this
at all
it's just like with that one sentence
you expect to be like i i i don't
understand this is it's it's too much
she literally just made it cocktail
length so she could have her weird
wedding dress fantasy what the hell are
you talking about jesse what are you
talking about
white cocktail dress
wearing white to another woman's wedding
is considered rude yeah no i like i mean
i think that's a little silly but i do
get it
but then
my mom had an anniversary party and the
white dress i wouldn't layer will let
her wear to the way who cares
i mean she sounds like a total
[ __ ] but still
my wife has been telling people who
don't know my parents
my wife has been telling people who
don't know my parents that they split up
after the wedding due to my dad's
cheating which is all made up but i
figured hey if it's helping her cope
cool
not cool
very not cool why would you do that
the story is spiraled into my dad left
my mom for a younger woman and screwed
her in court hasn't worked a day in her
life and my mom had to move into a
little bug infested apartment and take a
job at a fast food place this is like
one of those mobile game ads man
where like this uh a lady and like a
young baby like have to move into a
just like a derelict apartment and then
they'd give you like six options for how
to like fix a broken window you know
there's like a squeegee and a hammer and
a big saw a leaf blower
like what's going on here
last night we had dinner with my in-laws
and my parents walked in holding hands
and i saw my wife's eyes pop out of her
head oh oh no if it isn't the
consequences of my own actions i never
thought in a million years that this lie
could possibly come back and backfire on
us
my mom ended up saying hi to us and my
mother-in-law who is a bit nosy
and asked if they were getting back
together and my mom was obviously
confused my my mother-in-law is so nosy
like
her entire model for how she thinks
about these people is based on an
increasingly elaborate lie when she saw
one piece of evidence that it was all
made up she asked a simple question that
could have really struck anybody she's
so nosy
my mother-in-law tried to change the
subject but my mom wouldn't drop it so
the whole lie ended up coming out my mom
was furious about the fast food part
called not the cheating so much but
called my wife a [ __ ] and uninvited us
from christmas no loss there my wife was
so humiliated she was in tears i tried
really hard not to laugh but some
laughter came out this can't be real man
it's so good
i tried not to laugh but some laughter
came out the rest of dinner was awkward
when we got home i told my wife i feel
bad she was embarrassed but that was the
risk she took when she lied i went to
bed and didn't comfort her though she
was upset today my brother's wife who is
my wife's best friend called me and told
me i was an [ __ ] i should have
comforted her because she says i didn't
get how humiliated my wife was and that
i made her feel like it was her fault
she says it goes deeper than i get and
it bothers them both that that didn't
happen to my mom and that they feel
powerless she said i really [ __ ] up i
did apologize and cook her a nice dinner
tonight but she's still very emotional
over getting caught and her parents
laughing at her which maybe makes it
worse that i asked i don't even
understand
this is
like if it's always sunny in
philadelphia it was real
these people are all sociopaths
maybe with the exception of your wife's
parents
who seem
maybe okay
i mean like your parents seem like total
[ __ ]
my dad is useless
my mom spoke poorly in my wife my mom's
a spoiled princess
then your wife made up an insanely
elaborate
fan fiction lie about your parents being
divorced for
revenge i don't know really
it came back to bite her in the ass
and then you'd
i mean
just have a general tone of like
just being a kind of a [ __ ]
throughout your entire post like
everybody is an [ __ ] here for sure
like
nobody involved this story except your
in-laws are
even like within a normal bound of of
sanity here i think
it does feel a little ai generated like
i just i love this comment
this this is not a comment a human being
would write with no context my mom had
an anniversary party in the white dress
i wouldn't let her wear to the wedding
if anyone needs proof of how crazy she
is i can't imagine the kind of person
that would just
interject this into a story
and expect another person to understand
what they're talking about
like i i feel like this is a touring
test
and i'm i'm going to say that this is a
robot
because i don't want them to break out
of oscar isaac's house and then you know
filter into society
with the rest of the world unawares
she couldn't wear the dress to the
wedding because it's
white yes i understand the not to be
condescending i understand why she
couldn't wear the dress
to
the wedding
but why is
why is it proof of how crazy she is that
she wore it to an anniversary party
instead
it seems like just about the sanest
thing you could do
is wear an outfit that you bought
at an occasion in which it's appropriate
like i don't i don't get it
i guess i don't get it's petty
is it petty to wear a thing that
somebody wouldn't let you wear at event
a at event b where it's appropriate
she wore it out of spite what so what
[Laughter]
i do this is reminiscent of that one
other am i the [ __ ] post that was
like
it was all about like you can't wear
this dress my my mother-in-law bought
the dress that my wife was gonna wear to
the wedding but i don't know if it's
like a ridley scott prometheus alien
thing where like i'm not sure if it's a
direct continuation or it's like a
spiritual successor like if um
if benedict cumberbatch is gonna be like
i'm playing a totally different brand
new villain i swear to god and then like
an hour and a half into the movie he's
like my name is khan and you're like saw
that [ __ ] coming a mile away like i
don't i don't know what's going on i
feel like these are just kindred spirits
though like for all i know
anyway this is insane
um
i dude oh god there's another child free
post right underneath this as well
am i the [ __ ] for showering at 3 30
a.m in the communal shower for one to
two hours
yes
i don't even need to read the post okay
just in general if you make a habit of
showering for one hour
you're crazy
if you make a habit of showering for two
hours
what is wrong with you
even if you're not inconveniencing
anybody else two hours
all right now let's
i
let's i suggested they're insane let's
read the poster where they explain they
have a medical condition so i can be the
[ __ ] that's the pattern that i'm
comfortable with here
hello this is my first year in college
you gotta what is it what month is it
december
i'm so sorry to say this but this is the
real world speaking
you have to transfer
you have to transfer
for the rest of your collegiate career
you're gonna wear the label of that
person who wakes up at 3 30 a.m and
takes a two hour long shower
it's gonna follow you for the you're
everywhere you go you're gonna get up
and speak to defend your thesis they're
gonna be like shower guy shower guy hey
is that weird shower guy
you absolutely it's too late if it was
like the second week of school you might
be able to accept you know you might be
able to get yourself out of that
in december it's too late man
wait that's the shower guy you were
talking about
and like for the rest of your collegiate
career anytime you see people go
you're gonna be like oh [ __ ] they're
tyler they're calling me weird shower
guy
i'm telling you man you gotta
it's too late for you at this
institution you must
change for the next school year though
hello this is my first year in college i
wouldn't call myself a germaphobe
necessarily but i usually feel very
gross if i don't extremely thoroughly
clean myself in the shower this process
usually takes a while unless i scrub
super aggressively however when i went
to college the showers were communal
there's a total of five bathrooms on our
floor all spaced out within a one to two
minute walk each bathroom is equipped
with two showers is this a brain teaser
i know that my process my process this
is my design it takes a while i don't
want to inconvenience the other dorm
people
so i opted to just scrub myself
aggressively for 20 minutes usually then
on friday and monday and also sometimes
wednesday i take a one to two hour long
shower at 3 30 am this is so i could
leave time for the night owls who happen
to shower late and the people who might
want to shower in the morning i thought
this would be accommodating enough as i
knew hogging a stall for one to two
hours was pretty unreasonable so i tried
my best not to get into anybody's way
i feel bad like for this person
they are genuinely doing what they need
to do to
enable themselves to feel okay
but it's like
you gotta get some help
because this is
not normal
just to put it politely
uh
not not just inconvenient but like
like troubling
anyway let's read some more however
about a month into school the second
shower stall in the bathroom i usually
use this clogged maintenance has been
notified but it seems they haven't
bothered to fix it and every time
someone uses it it floods a lot the
whole bathroom gets wet so it's somewhat
of an unspoken rule to just not use it
therefore there's really only one
operational shower in the bathroom
anyway i didn't think my habits were a
bother to anyone until my roommate told
me she was talking to the girls next
door and one of them was mad that the
shower was sometimes taken up by me at
night which makes her take a walk to the
bathrooms down the hall apparently when
she waited for me to finish she was
stuck waiting for an hour and at that
point just chose not to shower i don't
think she knows it's me in the shower
i am actually happy
that they
believe this
because that is going to make it easier
sometimes you want to believe comforting
lies just to make you know the harshness
of life go down a little smoother
and i think this is i mean there's no
way they know it's not them
just once i lost myself here
but i feel really bad about it because i
know hogging the stall for hours is kind
of shitty am i the [ __ ] i'll probably
switch to the bathroom down the hall
regardless just wanted to know honestly
like why don't you just take like a 20
minute walk and go sh you know you're
if you're gonna shower for two hours
what's a 20 minute walk that's like
you know
15 of your total shower time
proportionally speaking you're not
really adding that much onto it
you might just commute read the edit oh
no
oh no
no the water is not running straight for
two hours my parents complained about
the same thing back when i first started
showering like this so i adjusted my
routine i used the water in the
beginning to wet my scrub brush hair and
a small bucket of water to help with
scrubbing then scrub myself clean most
of the time is then spent scrubbing with
the brush then shampoo the conditioner
scrub hair for 10 minutes then water on
to rinse everything off a lot more
scrubbing again then rinse again and
done i don't know how much the average
shower takes in water but no i'm
conscientious enough to not leave it
running for a straight two hours you
definitely need to talk to your parents
and like get some help because that is
like aren't you cold
i feel like if you were in like warm
water then you turned the shower off for
like half an hour you just stood in
there scrubbing yourself like wouldn't
feel like you would get
you'd get very chilly me that's not your
number one concern but i mean i'm not
comfortable going that in on this it's
obviously a person that that needs some
help more than mockery
at the same time i can also i mean i put
myself in the shoes of the person i was
waiting for the shower
it's one of those things where like in
99.9 of cases you're gonna be like sure
i'll just wait for them to get out how
long are they gonna be maximum another
15 minutes
you're waiting there for an hour i would
it's like a
i don't even know it's cause for alarm
for sure
am i an [ __ ] for laughing at a child
free woman wanting to be a housewife
said that
said the intersection of
many many many spicy boundaries
[Laughter]
just
there's a lot of
relationships kids
gender roles oh that's like
can you be an [ __ ] but still be right
can you be
wrong but still be based can you
can you accept that sometimes it's okay
to be an [ __ ] if it's very funny like
there's so many different
like nucleation points here
i can't wait
i've been online dating for quite a
while my profile very clearly states i'm
dating with marriage as the end goal i
matched a few weeks ago with a charming
woman who said she was also dating with
the intent to get married with a caveat
of wanting a traditional relationship
where she would be a housewife i agree i
would be happy with that arrangement
indubitably well this is sheldon from
the big bang theory um
in the future we chat about a variety of
subjects and set up a date for an early
dinner two weeks out from today
much to my surprise during the date she
mentions she does as i i'm a nerd i'm a
nerd i gotta i gotta blow my nose real
quick
i'm back
much to my surprise during the date she
casually mentioned she doesn't want
children in my confusion i ask her but
you said you were looking to become a
housewife she responds you can be a
housewife and still not want children
admittedly i did chuckle
but it wasn't a full belly roar of a
laugh just a chuckle she took great
offense to my laugh and asked why can't
she be child free and the housewife my
response was and i'll admit
it doesn't sound nice it sounds very
chauvinistic but my first thought was
the same thing that he said which is
what are you gonna do all day
she says what do older housewives do
after their children go off on their own
my response was usually go back to work
i told her it's gonna be next to
impossible to find a man willing to take
that deal she gets angry and leaves i
tell my sister and she thinks i crush
that poor woman's dreams
am i the [ __ ] for telling her the
truth
this is a this is a very funny
story
for sure
um
so i've
lasty think that i am not based i have
said many times we i've got firsthand
like
kate is not a housewife but she takes on
the vast majority of you know the
child-rearing and the domestic chore
responsibilities right i've said many
times
the idea because we've had a lot of am i
the [ __ ] posts that are like this
um
where like people insinu like when uh
the the post that was like the woman
from the big engineering firm went on
maternity leave right and everyone was
like she's just trying to get a vacation
she's just lazy
genuinely
like especially for the first year or so
of the baby's life
working eight hours a day
was much easier than looking after the
baby
for eight hours a day on top of
cleaning
and doing the other necessary stuff for
like
you know household maintenance so i'm
definitely not trying to insinuate
that being a housewife is
less valid than any other work on the
planet okay
the only thing i am going to say is that
without a kid
i do feel like it's a lot easier i mean
by definition i feel like most people
would agree
it's not like when you have a kid you
know all of a sudden you're like oh
everything's become so much easier at
this point
um
i do
i mean i do kind of wonder like
what you would do
you know i'm not saying it's a bad deal
or she should feel bad for asking for it
like if what she wants
is to
just
live
not to be rude
then sure put that in your profile and
then sift as much sand as you need to
sift to find that golden nugget don't
get me wrong but like
unless you live in wayne manor like
what do you do you can cook
you can clean
like you're not if you're cleaning your
own
house top to bottom every single day
you're just playing with it at that
point you know you do laundry laundry
can sometimes take a while if you're a
normie because you stack it up for like
a week and then you do it all at once if
you're doing it every day what are you
gonna do you're gonna pop like two
t-shirts i could see it like if it was
the victorian era
and you had to have like a washboard and
go like
with every piece of clothing but like if
you got like a maytag or something like
that like
you just to kind of toss it in
is it impossible for a woman to work
from home why are you why are you trying
to make me look like an [ __ ] she
doesn't say she wants to work from home
she says she wants to be a housewife
you're putting
ideals into my head that i don't
subscribe to
don't get me wrong there's a lot of
stuff that you know that goes into
maintaining a household
you know it's not just
cooking dinner cleaning once a day like
there's other stuff involved
appointments repairs maintenance
bills like i'm starting to run out but
like
a lot
a lot of it is really like
you know the child rearing
kids are the the majority for certain
i think at least but uh
i mean i look
i'm just gonna be honest with you
i don't think that uh
hello gotham by the way hello i don't
think that she's an [ __ ] for uh
for wanting to just be a housewife and
also not have kids
but i also don't think he's an [ __ ]
for like laughing about it because it is
kind of funny
like she can want whatever she wants
but
simultaneously like
it's kind of a funny sentence
like it's like if if you said like oh
what do you want to do with your life
and you're like i want to be a
millionaire
and then someone was like well what do
you want to do for work and you're like
i don't really want to work i just want
to have like a million dollars
that's a funny sentence
by the way
live your dream like follow whatever you
know your your north star is
i think that's kind of everybody's dream
i guess
but like
you know
doesn't mean i wouldn't expect people to
laugh at it don't get me wrong
also like i this is admittedly rude but
like when his sister said she crushed
that poor woman's dreams like
you know
if it's like a 10 year old kid and they
want to be in the nba and you're like ah
your dad's
five seven
that's a kind of a dick move if you're
talking about a full-grown adult that
just wants to like be rich
it's not really like a dream
it's like a wish
there's nothing wrong with having wishes
don't get me wrong but like
you know
it wasn't really crush she just kind of
laughed at her because this was really
funny thing to say
i mean she's full grown she might just
be 19 okay it's still [ __ ] funny
if anything it might actually be funnier
i don't know why but i'm just i was
imagining like a 28 year old saying it
now i'm imagining like a 19 year old
saying it and i'm like
first off that's hilarious secondly
you're 19. you don't know what you want
to do with your life no offense
unless you're like lebron james
you know what you started college like
three months ago
you know where you want to be when
you're 50 like shut the [ __ ] up you
don't know what you're talking about
all of your classes start with the the
phrase intro to blank intro to blank
intro to blank and you're like
where i see myself in 30 years at home
no you don't know what you're talking
about
there's nothing wrong with it you got to
choose something but like
anyway
well that's react court interesting



the rumors of react court's demise have
been greatly uh exaggerated it just got
killed temporarily while i um
underwent a month of infectious disease
sickness
that was not great and my voice was a
little bit you know under the effect of
it but then look at this here we are
we're back
and we're reacting to you know what we
should be reacting to hold on get this
trash out of here i mean i don't know
this post might actually be goaded but
we got to go to top posts of the month
there's no reason for us to be doing
the the
current posts in the hot filter
give me all the bangers that we missed
over the course of the preceding 30 days
that's the ticket oh
man
i love seeing all this red [ __ ] flare
this is my favorite song
this thread has been locked okay here
you go
am i the [ __ ] for thinking that a
friend with a miserable
living situation would want to house sit
my beautiful home without being paid
yes
you don't even need to go through
like i'm not even like this
guy you know this is not hassan's stream
i am not a person that's like you know
if you ever say what's up to me and i
answer you owe me money for the
emotional labor that i put in okay but
if you're asking someone to do a job for
you and you don't want to pay them
because their life sucks that actually
makes you like a double [ __ ]
like i haven't even read like what's the
what the body of the post is but it's a
bad start am i the [ __ ] for thinking
that a friend with a miserable living
situation would want to housesit my
beautiful home without being paid
i live in and run a beautiful bed and
breakfast is a beautifully restored
colonial on 25 acres with mountain views
nobody knows what the [ __ ] that means
right it's not just me
i'm in my
early to mid 30s i
have a house when people say
it's a colonial i don't know what that
means it's from the era of the colonies
sometimes you'll be in someone's house
and they'll be like it was built in 1890
and i'm like all i go is oh wow because
i'm like that's old but i don't know
what that means
like is that were they building better
houses in the 1890s were they building
worse houses
i don't understand anyway
it's got mountain views fireplaces cloth
yeah okay like they i don't if you're
asking someone to house it for you
i'm i can't believe i'm stun locked by
like the first sentence basically
you're asking someone to house it for
you you think they're going to be like
oh you got to pay me 100 bucks a day and
then they're like well it's got clawfoot
tubs oh in that case i should be paying
you 100 bucks a day
to take a bath in something that
isn't built into the wall but instead
has like some brass feet that you can't
even see when you're in the bathtub
i wake up feeling very lucky every day
big time big time
big time that chest our family lives in
the back of the house and the front is
rented to well to do strangers from
boston and nyc people pay me quite a bit
of money to come stay at my house rad oh
my god
what a [ __ ]
just the way that you're riding this is
like
it's just annoying right it's like if
your house is cool
you don't need to tell me how cool it is
and how awesome your life is also if
you're renting it to well-to-do
travelers from boston nyc you should be
able to pay a house sitter imo but our
family is planning two weeks away this
spring we've shut down the bnb for that
time period i have a friend who is
involuntarily living with her mom and
brother while she looks for a new job at
apartment she's in a tough situation and
generally hates it i asked her if she'd
like the house sit for us she could set
up for a few weeks in our fanciest guest
room she'd have the whole place to
herself and the only responsibility
would be to feed the dog twice a day
it's literally do you ever see the
shining
you're asking her to jack torrence
she was offended to learn that i wasn't
offering to pay her she can stay in a
250 a night room for free for two or
three weeks i assume she'd be delighted
just to have a place to stay when i was
jobless in my 20s i would have been over
the moon if a similar opportunity had
presented itself to me
would you
like
i just feel like when i was in my
mid-20s
someone being like hey for free
you could stay in an unnecessarily large
abandoned bed and breakfast in 25
acres of wilderness
i would be like that's okay i think i'm
going to stay in the city where my
friends are
what do you think like
i mean i guess if you love
hiking or like sleeping in a different
bed every single night
there's there's some merit to that but
like
i don't know it just seems like this
person is out of their minds
also like who wants to stay in a hotel
in your own city for fun
like i like staying in a hotel
but if i would never get like a hotel
room i think in
vancouver
because i think i would be there and i
would be like i wish i was at home i
wish i had a big fridge instead of a
little fridge
i wish i had you know two bathrooms
instead of one bathroom anyway sorry
it's i'm going too far yeah plus it's
not even gonna have amenities there's no
room service
i'm a little surprised honestly maybe
it's because i've been away from react
court for a little while i've probably
moved a little bit further on the
political compass to align myself with
twitch chat i'm a little surprised
that
the judgment is 48 yes 38 no i would
have thought it would be
much more
yes
i'm a little surprised but let's let's
dig into the comments here i mean i
think it's definitely yes
you're asking someone well i don't know
it's i guess it's not look okay let's go
look at the edit for one second
you look at the edit it's like
because they're not actually doing
anything
normally we do not get house sitters nor
do we need one we usually just find a
spot for our dog and shut the place down
okay like it doesn't make you
an [ __ ]
for basically being like hey do you want
to stay in our place for for a couple of
weeks if you feed our dog but then be
that being said you basically are asking
them to do something because you're
asking them to feed the dog if they
don't house it you're going to have to
pay
a kennel or give the dog to a family
member for three weeks so you know i
mean when we
go away for like four days
one of kate's friends comes and
cat sits the cats you don't have to do
anything you literally just walk in for
five minutes scoop the litter box and
feed them
and we still pay them
you know
they are always like it's literally no
work don't pay us and i'm like no it's
literally some work we're gonna pay you
and it's like it's a delicate dance but
i just don't understand i mean if look
here's the thing
if
we got a king solomon this as well
i think you shouldn't have to pay your
friend in this situation
but
you then
have to house it
their house for free for an equivalent
length of time you don't if you're not
gonna pay then we go back to an
equivalent exchange of bartering and
something tells me that this person is
so in love with their house they want to
have
intercourse with the air intakes
they probably don't want to ever leave
their house except for those two weeks
they're going on vacation even though
being inside of their bed and breakfast
is a vacation in and of itself
especially if you're a well-to-do
traveler from new york or boston this it
already pisses me off too
just cause like how do you know all of
your
all of your guests are from new york or
boston you don't know that
you never have somebody come from
oswego you never have somebody come from
albany
you never have somebody come from
massapequa
it's only only the
most uh elite urbanites from the two
major coastal cities in the northeast
[ __ ] pisses me off man
anyway sorry
i'm inclined to think that maybe they're
not that big of an [ __ ] for the ask
they're a little bit of an [ __ ] for
the way that they are so in love with
their own house that they think someone
else would want to stay in it for free
on i've accidentally clicked off
[Laughter]
hope i don't click off this is my first
time doing react cord in a while i
apologize okay
i'm not my muscle memory is all gone
as you pointed out she's jobless you
need a house sitter if you really wanted
to help you could treat her like a human
and offer the job instead of a charity
case she should be grateful she she can
do you a favor by watching your house
and taking care of your animal this is
not how you treat your friends use that
quite a bit of money you pay her you
make and pay her for her labor you're
the [ __ ] it's not even you don't even
have to type based that's just like the
truth that's the same reading of the
situation
opie updated that she doesn't need a
house sitter as they usually board the
dog or leave it with family okay then
don't get a house sitter then
just because you could
do something for free doesn't mean that
somebody else that you want to do it for
you has to do it for free
that's insanity
it sounds more like ops doing her a
favor i must be a little bit askew
versus the people in this post because
staying in an empty hotel in the woods
does not seem like
like sure
it's a 200 and 250
dollar a night room
but
like not just because of the room
nobody is going to like this hotel and
being like oh this square space
is worth 250 a night you got the front
desk you got the concierge maybe you got
if it's a bed and breakfast they're
providing you with the opportunity to
also purchase some food you know it's
there's amenities
apart from the claw bathtubs
25 acres to yourself you don't need 25
you need like one acre to yourself
you can't use all 25 acres
simultaneously maybe again this is like
city living
has has given me this biased opinion
like you need 25 acres just shut up but
you're using like one third of one acre
simultaneously
big whoop
i just like knowing that there's 22
other acres out there that nobody else
can use even though i'm not using it
all right malf would use it
but you're not planting a garden on this
colonial
come on
house sitting is free unless there's a
lot of work involved
where do you live that house sitting is
usually free i'm in new zealand and have
never heard of anyone being paid to
house it even when there's pets to be
cared for i look i think that that could
be true
but again is based on an equivalent
exchange it's like instead of bringing
the market economy into the situation
now you're in la cosa nostra if somebody
house sits for you for free you owe them
a favor
so if you would rather
be asked later to help them move for two
days for free
then that's fine otherwise you know
maybe you could work something out
financially because that's what the
paper's there for in the first place
you're the [ __ ] to be honest my
parents do this to me all the time try
to offer me up the house it for them or
their friends
with for free with that their house is
so nice you can just stay there well a
mansion is nicer than my apartment it
still worked for me to live my life
somewhere that isn't my home and do even
a minor amount of chores it also makes
me feel like they're looking down on my
living situation as less than when it's
really just comfortable to try and live
somewhere that is in your home
i think i read that sentence very wrong
people talk people talk sure she could
have done it for free it's not a ton of
chores she's not wrong for asking to be
paid you're assuming an empty house is
worth it to her so true so true
you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ]
here we go finally someone that i i
agree with
looking at this from your friend's
perspective how much will this benefit
them 25 25 acres is big enough to not be
in town does she have a car to go look
for jobs in apartments while watching
your bmb there's gas money she could you
lose two to three weeks of getting her
life together also what is your friend
gonna do once everyone gets back from
vacation she could be screwed with no
place to go i thought they were gonna
take it in a different direction and be
like
you know
she's just gonna be alone in the
overlook hotel but
i don't know it's just kind of a weird
energy to be like you know
hey my house is nicer than your house do
you want to watch it for free
just
i mean at least throw him a pittance or
something
at least like stock the the commissary
or something like that
am i the [ __ ] filtered this month
am i the [ __ ] for dropping my son
this is a spicy one man
am i the [ __ ] for dropping my son off
at his dad's during his custody time
even though he was scheduled to fly out
on that day
well this should be
inoffensive
our custody agreement is that our ex has
our son for overnights two weekends a
month he never sticks to it though and
usually asks to see him whenever it
suits him i was supposed to drop him off
friday evening but the night before at 2
am he texted me to let me know he had a
flight to catch late friday so i would
have to keep our son i was pissed
because this isn't the first time he's
done this and this was one of the
biggest issues we had with our marriage
him leaving on short notice constantly
and just expecting me to deal with it i
ended up taking my son to him and
ignoring the message when we got there
he tried to get me to take him home with
me and called me childish and petty when
i refused he ended up taking our son
with him but he's been sending me angry
texts the entire time since apparently
our son has been making it hard for him
to get any work done
well you know
it's kind of what you sign up for am i
the [ __ ] i'm going to add this here
because people keep telling me to go to
the courts to try and get full custody
i've tried my ex ended up getting even
more time and refused to give me full
custody also my son is enjoying his time
with his dad
despite everything my ex isn't the type
to take out his anger on our son or make
him feel like he isn't wanted when he
has him um
i'm look
i'm not used to these being so short it
kind of feels like an everybody sucks
here with i will say like definitely
it sounds like the dad was being a
[ __ ] at late notice being like you
know don't bring our kid tomorrow
because i have a flight
that's like a jerk move
um the mom
on the other hand
i don't think she necessarily did much
wrong
and i guess if she's confident that when
she sends the kid to her dad even if the
dad is upset he's gonna be a good parent
then that's not so bad
but
i can't help but feel that if
the dad kinda sucks
maybe uh
and this is like maybe i'm not in a
position to explain this but like
maybe it's better to just keep the kid
and
uh
you know give them the best weekend that
you possibly could even if it's
frustrating
rather than
i don't know run not run the risk of
like alienating the father but on the
other hand run the risk of like
compromising the enjoyment of their
child but then i don't know like i'm
getting legal advice from twitch chat
but then they were like
if it's a court order they have to obey
it okay well in that case not the
[ __ ]
is the son three or fifteen
probably my guess would be younger
because i feel like if you have a 15
year old child they're gonna let you get
as much work done as you want to get
done
because they're going to be in their
room on their dang ipads watching their
tick tocks
filming tick tock
water bottle challenges with the ring
light you know how kids are these days
so true so true
i don't even want to read the comments
for this one this is just like this is
too complicated
this is a toxic situation that's not fun
get me out of here what do you think
this is a judd apatow movie
am i the [ __ ] for not inviting my
adoptive parents to my wedding now we're
talking
now we're talking
[Laughter]
much better
i love the wedding am i the [ __ ] man
i 30 f am getting married to my fiance
in may i was adopted when i was a baby
and my adoptive parents did their best
to raise me and support me through
college we always had a good
relationship and i obviously love them
let me stop you right there i would
advise you to invite your adoptive
parents to your wedding
the first two sentences here
essentially tell you the way that the
story should go probably unless there's
a huge but at the end of this that's
like they recently went insane
when i was 23 i decided to search for my
biological parents and long story short
they were teenagers when they had me
they are still together and have two
more children they said they wanted to
keep me but they couldn't raise me so
they decided to put me up for adoption
the thing that really hurt me was that
in my childhood and teenage years they
tried to contact my adoptive parents and
have a relationship with me but my
adoptive parents refused
okay it's a complicated experience that
i or a complicated situation i have no
experience with
let's move on and then keep that context
for the future
when i confronted my adoptive parents
they said they were afraid i might
prefer my biological parents so they
tried to keep them away
i was hurt and disappointed and decided
to go low contact over the years we
built a better relationship but it's not
like before so for my wedding i decided
to ask my biological father to walk me
down the aisle he obviously said yes
when my adoptive parents learned they
were hurt and said their worst fear had
come to reality and if i insist on
putting my biological parents before
them i shouldn't invite them to the
wedding well this i'm so surprised this
is actually a justifiable but
i did not think that they could craft a
moment
where uh
they seemed a little bit more
justifiable
my answer was that they are not invited
then since then all my adoptive family
are calling an [ __ ] so am i the
[ __ ]
minor update i talked to them and
suggested both dads could walk me down
the aisle my adoptive parents refused
because they said that they did all the
hard work this is a real king solomon
situation
king solomon suggested we split the
aisle in half and the adoptive parents
said no but wait in this case this means
the adoptive parents were the real mvps
all along
maybe the metaphor doesn't hold
um
i mean i
personally is a very delicate situation
without a doubt
but i think it's a kind of like an
everybody's
maybe not the [ __ ]
it's tough
hold on i hear my baby crying it's like
a brain short circuiter you can't you
can't have any kind of like coherence
stream of consciousness when you hear
your own child cry
it's like biologically it just overrides
all of the other stuff going on in your
brain
i will say i i've got a very funny story
i can't believe i haven't told it yet
when i picked her up from daycare
yesterday she had uh
like a biscuit
like a a digestive cracker slash cookie
that had been giving given to her by her
daycare provider
so we took her home with the biscuit
and uh she was like check it out like
cookie cookie and then she couldn't
really eat it but she would like put it
in her mouth and go
like pretend to eat it
hello
um
and you know she was walking around with
it it was so cute
and then she was starting to climb up
the stairs we're watching her to make
sure she doesn't fall you know we got
the the hands ready to catch her in case
she slips
but while she was climbing up the stairs
she must have like put too much pressure
on the biscuit hand
and then it snapped in two
and she just immediately
she like sat down on her butt and just
tears poured down her face
and it was like it's such a complicated
cocktail of emotions
because i was like
sad because my child was going through
like the most emotional thing they've
gone through in weeks
like they there was genuine emotional
pain she was upset
but it was also really funny because i
was like it's a
it's a digestive biscuit
like it's you could literally still eat
it it doesn't even like it's just such a
minor thing to go
nuts for it was like i was the saddest
i've been in forever and i was also like
this is the funniest thing i've ever
seen
[Laughter]
hello
eating a biscuit she's eating a biscuit
right now
she had a very good time in the
kindergarten oh let's go all the all the
original members were there whoa so we
were the only ones who washed out yeah
and then they had like a panda on the
wall oh yeah and then she kept like
leaving the class to see the panda
and then well the instructor was like oh
why is she here
and then
uh
i was like she she really likes the
panda
oh that's cute though she's she's
showing off her big brain
my man
she's doing more more more a little sign
language for you more more more
more and more twitch sub more more no no
no that's okay
cracker
okay
it did sound like she said kaka
i i can still hear it okay bye bye
bye bye tomorrow
tomorrow you gotta get your tail out of
the door man
that's why i was calling it a biscuit
anyway
all right back to the lecture at hand
let me hydrate for a moment
um i
look i the the more i've simmered on
this i kind of feel like
at a glance it seems like you should
treat your adoptive parents with more
respect
i'm not even really like look you're
raising it uh an adopted child maybe
they're in their teens the birth parents
wanna speak to their birth child that's
a tough situation you know
i i think it's bad reasoning to be like
oh she's gonna prefer her birth parents
but i also think that there is maybe
some
valid reasoning that's like it's already
complicated to raise a teenager
like maybe just wait till they're
18 or something like that and then you
can meet them
that being said
it's also tough cause like is it your
right to say so but i guess that's like
a secondary decision
um
regardless i think the adoptive parents
for issuing an ultimatum that makes them
the [ __ ]
like
your role is the adoptive parent i mean
just as the parents in general i think
when your kid is getting married is not
to start complicating the system by
throwing out ultimatums like only one of
us can go only one set of parents can go
or something like that
as soon as you start to be like it's
either them or me
you're not the [ __ ] if you're like
okay well it's them because they're not
issuing ultimatums it might be a
different story if it was like you know
don't invite ted bundy to the wedding or
your dad's not gonna come because he
hates that guy i would be like okay i'll
invite my dad instead of ted bundy
but like apart from that it's like you
know it's your special day
just invite who isn't that the spirit of
like
getting big groups of families together
it's like you probably hate like five to
fifteen percent of the people you're
going to see but it's not about you
you just go you sit down you clap you
say oh you have a glass of wine at the
uh reception and then you leave and in
the car you're like [ __ ] i hate that guy
jesus christ just shut up nobody cares
about your houseboat
is that's what it's like it's what it's
supposed to be at least
so i i personally
i would say op not the [ __ ] on this
one
you know if anytime you issue an
ultimatum i don't think you can be upset
if the uh
if the ultimatum like blows up in your
face
so many of the i mean this one's not
exactly that situation but so many of
the wedding posts are basically like i'm
getting married but somebody who's not
really involved in the wedding wants me
to do something i don't want to do
am i the [ __ ] it's like no you know
know your place
[Laughter]
if you're getting if you're one of the
two people getting married you have like
100 influence everybody else show up eat
some salmon eat some scalloped potatoes
take a couple of drinks from the open
bar and then go home
my two cents at least my two cents i
gotta know who pooped mouth stop
sabotaging
my stream okay
i'm trying to build some conversational
momentum here what did you run in the
casino let me see okay
choose prediction who pooped last
me or the baby i'm deleting the bet
because i don't know the answer i
couldn't tell you
and i don't want to go through the
necessary research to figure out okay
i know when i pooped i don't know when
the baby poop lasts because i haven't
had eyes on the baby for the last three
and a half hours
it's not a scam you all got your points
back
let that be a lesson to you
there's so many parenting ones i'm just
skipping that one
how about this
am i the [ __ ] for invading my
boyfriend's privacy and getting him and
his co-worker fired over inappropriate
behavior um i suppose it depends what
the inappropriate behavior is
i guess
well maybe
was it like a crime
let's find out
by the way
if you just hit
enter on your keyboard it will create a
paragraph break
and then you can
it just makes it a lot less intimidating
when you load up a post like this
because like the ideas are separated by
white space
this is this is big people talk for sure
i was sitting in the passenger seat of
my best friend's ride my boyfriend's car
when he ran into the store to pay for
gas i guess it was a long line because
he took a while anyway his phone was
face up in the console and started
vibrating against my better judgment i
unlocked his phone prior to this instant
we'd been struggling over trust issues
specifically him having wild flirty
borderline sexting conversations over
various hidden social media accounts and
me obsessively looking through his phone
and computer trying to catch him alright
this is just not a good situation for
anybody
that is just uh
that is not a red flag that is like uh
it's just red
all over this is a terrible start
there's never been an earlier everybody
sucks here
in our most recent reconciliation we
promised each other we'd do better
that seems specific and easy to adhere
to back to the situation at hand i
punked out on my promise
one moment please
that's comedy
during our last reconciliation we
promised each other to do better back to
the situation at hand i punked out on my
promise and opened his phone while he
was in the store the incoming messages
from his co-worker ben most of which
were pictures of pictures from another
woman's phone after some more context
from ben it turned out these pictures
were images he took using his phone of
their supervisors private photos in her
cell phone that he had asked to borrow
because his was dead
so he asked to borrow
his supervisor's phone and then took
photos on his phone of private photos
from her phone yeah that's actually like
i think that's criminal
also just because your phone is dead
what are you doing with somebody else's
phone
you remember a phone unless you're
calling 9-1-1
what are you doing with somebody else's
phone
if your phone dies you just ask them for
a charger
you can't you my whole life is on this
thing you know i got multi-factor
authentication i got
i got apps with like saved data and
stuff like that
you can't have my phone
i'd rather give you my wallet honestly i
think at this point
anyway
also i guess his phone wasn't dead
that's a good point but that's like i
guess secondary
also i don't have that much data on my
data plan we only get two gigs a month
if you watch one youtube video in the
can like i'm 50 tapped for the next
three weeks
i get it's too sensitive this thing
doesn't leave like my pocket essentially
unless i'm holding it in my hands
okay so this is not a good idea
in the eyes of anybody saying and also
the law
he'd apparently gone to the bathroom to
make a private call and texted my
boyfriend photos of their supervisor a
beautiful young woman from brazil they
were provocative picks lingerie some
nudes some hardcore like a dirty
magazine centerfold how old are you
like this is already gross but also like
are you 55 years old there's nothing
wrong with that it would just add some
context
also i can't figure out where i was in
the discourse because there's no line
breaks
i was immediately repulsed hurt in a
shame that my bf could be a part of this
i knew if i brought this up it was going
to escalate beyond anything i was ready
to handle so i pulled a ben and took
some pictures of the pictures that were
sent to his phone along with the
additional messages from ben detailing
his process and getting the photos and
you took photos of the photos that
shouldn't have been there to begin with
now you've done the crime as well
like for less of a scumbag purpose but
like
now these these photos have been
photocopied so many times
you just it it's out there
anyway
um sorry i gotta find myself again here
i returned the phone to the center
console as though it had been untouched
boyfriend returned to the car none the
wiser until we pulled out the parking
lot and came to a red light and he
reached for his phone upon initial
inspection he did that not so subtle
side angled turn
hold on he reached for his phone when he
hit a red light
so he was ju so he's he's also like
texting and driving essentially
considering that this is only one
paragraph like i hate everybody involved
with this story immediately
just wanted just wanted to look at my
texts just want to look at my text at
the red light
just wait till you get home nobody's
doing anything i don't look at my phone
at the red light
people are like oh you're not driving
yeah well you know your car is in drive
unless you go park at a red light or
something like that and then also you
know what you're causing everybody else
behind you to get pissed off
because you're going
and then the light turns green
and then you're like
and then the car behind you is like and
then you're like okay sorry my mistake i
know you're like that never happens but
i bet if i pushed you you would be like
okay it happened one time that's one
time too many
if everybody out there is doing it one
time i live in a city with like two
million people in it
don't look at you look at your phone in
a red light
just exercise some discipline for once
in your life
how long is the longest red light you've
ever been at in your life like two
minutes
just listen to the radio
you're at an average red light for like
30 seconds you can't not be
electronically stimulated for 30 seconds
you need to see a doctor
that's
moving on i'm going to take a photo of
the chat right now and then i'm gonna
take a photo of the photo of the chat so
that i don't lose it
stop using your phone while you drive
like obviously don't use your phone
while you're like on the highway but
also you don't need to pick up your
phone
when you're at a red light
and run the risk of inconveniencing
everybody else behind you just because
you can't go 10 seconds without seeing
something that makes you pissed off
sorry okay
upon initial inspection he did that not
so subtle side angled turn
so i wouldn't be able to see the screen
after which he put it immediately into
his pocket and began acting super sauce
i played stupid but i'm sure he noticed
the messages weren't on unread status
and had his suspicions we spent the rest
of the afternoon in a weird mood then i
went home without so much as a goodbye
the next morning i began corresponding
with his company's hr department and the
supervisor from the photos embarrassed
and heard she confirmed she did lend her
phone to ben and those pictures were in
fact stolen from her phone that
afternoon i got a call from my now bf
well x now
he's done with me he says he was fired
they both were he claims i jumped the
gun and had no way of knowing that ben
was going to involve him i coldly told
him i had no idea what he's talking
about and hung up the phone it's been a
few days we still haven't spoken am i
the [ __ ]
this is so this is a ball of wax man
this is a whole ball of wax um
let's start at the highest level
i don't think you're the [ __ ]
for reporting a legitimate betrayal of
trust and crime to an hr department at
the relevant company
like that was a really gross thing
for
ben in this situation to do that should
be reported
now here's where things get complicated
is your boyfriend a scumbag
yeah
but it's not like illegal to receive a
text
it does seem to indicate that maybe
there's i don't want to say a pattern
but when ben got this
contraband
he was like
i know exactly who would want to see
this
that is very sus don't get me wrong but
he didn't actually take any illegal
action that was proven over the course
of this so i don't know if he should
have been fired but that's more like is
hr the [ __ ] i guess ben is going
bye-bye that's a given
but the boyfriend i don't know i mean
let's be honest it was one of those
situations where you're like
you probably
shouldn't be canned but you're like you
know when you're like in court and
you're like i know you murdered this
person but like i don't have the proof
for it but we all know it
and then that's when gerard butler says
you know he starts taking control of the
cell phone signals to blow up everybody
else's cell phone in um
law abiding citizen you know what i'm
talking about
now i know in a perfect world
it would have been
good if the boyfriend reported ben first
but like if she called that night again
i'm not trying to be in the boyfriend's
defense it's just like he might have he
might have been like i'm going to do it
tomorrow and then
not done it
you could have told hr that i don't know
we weren't convincing the hr
situation now like okay anyway those
excuse me a new version of wavelink is
available
i will close this
anybody else use the elgato wave 3
microphone
i'll just hit remind me later on that
one
update now
it's a good mic don't get me wrong i
wish it would not ever pop up anything
though
so like ben is a
future convict
soon to be incarcerated
boyfriend definitely like a dirtbag
no doubt about it
may or may not be criminally culpable
that's beyond my area of expertise but
certainly a scumbag i don't really
think that in this given the scale of
the problem with this situation i don't
think that the girlfriend is like an
[ __ ] for unlocking her boyfriend's
phone like if this was a normal
situation between normal people
and there was no reason to distrust
anything if she looked through her
boyfriend's phone i would be like that's
an [ __ ] move but this guy's a real
piece of work
i mean she opened his phone and she
found something immediately i'm not
saying that justifies
betraying the trust of her boyfriend but
at the same time
you know it's not like she opened it and
she found like uh
you know just a photo of him
a selfie of him in the gym or something
it was like you know literally like that
day
[Laughter]
she's kind of an ass i mean maybe this
is not
something you think about rationally in
the moment but i feel like it's kind of
an [ __ ] move to then take photos of
the photos
but maybe i'm like overly adhering to
the letter of the law
maybe maybe it was good that she had
them so at least she could give proof to
hr in case it was deleted so you know
what upon thinking about that i don't
necessarily think she sucks
if she sucks it's only for not
uh probably breaking up with this
scumbag earlier so i would just say not
the [ __ ] i think that's where i've
come around here
my personal feelings aside based on the
way that she wrote and
um the fact that she's with someone who
texts and drives
my personal judgments and biases aside i
don't think she's necessarily the
[ __ ] in this situation
as a poster
maybe
as a as a human being in the given this
situation i would say not the [ __ ]
not the [ __ ] 69
nice
am i the [ __ ]
for a joke i made during my best man's
speech
i'm inclined to say not the [ __ ] but
maybe that's just cause i could see this
happening to me
i34m was recently the best man in my
friend's second wedding i was also the
best man at his first i saw this joke
online and it made me laugh so i stole
it for my opening speech i said right
well welcome back everyone which got
more than a few laughs especially from
the bride who seemed to find it
hilarious that's really funny
that's like
that's actually
look if you can't laugh at that
everybody's a grown-up
life's funny come on
everything went well speech over and
done with though later on after a few
drinks my friend began to rip me a new
[ __ ] telling me i was out of line
with that kind of joke and how i'd
embarrassed him and it wasn't funny and
i shouldn't have brought his last
marriage into this i mean a best man's
speech will always be more jokey than
anything and beyond that it was fairly
tame and that was the only reference to
his last marriage was i really out of
the line
no not the ass that's the easiest one
i've ever seen not the [ __ ]
not even like a little bit that's just
funny
you would have been an [ __ ] if you've
been like hey who wants to anybody want
to pre-book the venue for wedding 3 we
can save 25 if we get in right now like
that would make you kind of an [ __ ]
but just saying welcome back everyone
that's great
that's even that's still pretty funny
all right well
i know who i'm not asking to be my best
man am i the [ __ ] for refusing to
tell for
let me rephrase am i the [ __ ] for
telling my gf i refuse to plan my meals
in advance
i'm going to guess let me guess
everything else in your life is going
fine
i 34 male run a beautiful bed and
breakfast but that's an aside people pay
me to stay in my house rad
okay hold on sorry
there you go
i started to live with my girlfriend
almost six months ago i'm 34 male she's
35 female
and we have this ongoing issue that just
escalated she has this weird obsession
with planning food like it's the most
important topic in the world she
constantly asks what my plans are for
food the moment i wake up she wanted to
have discussions about us doing a weekly
chart wtf
with wtf with meals asked me for lists
whenever she goes to the store and it's
just super
pushy i'll be honest with you i kind of
like having my meals i don't i don't
plan them out
weekly
but i kind of would like to
i don't know if i have that kind of like
drive right now but that just seems like
a smart idea
to have all of your at least your like
you know lunches and dinners planned out
weekly so that you know what to buy when
you go to the grocery store
that doesn't mean you can't occasionally
be like you know i know we were supposed
to have you know some
falafel tonight but do you want to just
order a pizza i'm tired you can pivot
off of the chart you know on a on an at
runtime basis
but still like you know it's nice to be
organized like that
because you structure the rest of your
day around it that's why i like having a
set meal time and a snack time like a
like a kid that's in preschool
because then i'm like well i you know i
had breakfast at like 8 30 and then i
know maybe i'll have a snack like during
the first ad break of the stream then
i'll eat lunch at two and then i won't
eat anything because we usually have
dinner around like 6 30 and then i don't
have to eat before bed and then i feel
like in the interim periods it helps me
like focus more but anyway
my stance is
this we're two adults i have zero
expectations of her to cook
come on
i get it you're a woke king but zero
zero
i feel like we my wife and i have
expectations of one another to cook
that just seems normal to me zero
at all
i was never in a situation where i was
unable to eat because i didn't plan food
in advance i really can't decide what i
want before i'm actually hungry and i
don't see any need to limit myself to
these choices
okay uh 2x a day doordash customer has
been spotted
what do you mean you've never been in
you couldn't figure out what you want
i'm getting more mad about this one than
about the revenge porn one which says
something about me but it's just it's
very much in my wheelhouse to get
upset about mundane things because you
can go in harder without it being such a
sensitive issue but like
you realize
that like when you're hungry you're
hungry for food
it's not like
you spec i'm specifically hungry for
a cheeseburger
nothing else would satisfy this hunger
you can have a craving which is also
fine but you don't need to indulge a
craving at every single meal
some meals you're like i'm gonna
specifically go out of my way to indulge
a craving
whether healthy or unhealthy i'm not
trying to make that part of the the
distinction
but most of the meals i eat are like i
want to eat food that tastes pretty good
at a minimum but whatever it is doesn't
matter that much
that's at least that's the way i
my mental model for for how i try to eat
at least
i never spend more than 30 minutes
cooking again i'm like i'm getting
pissed off because these are just lies
you're 34 years old you've never spent
more than 30 minutes cooking
have a little ambition
every meal you've ever cooked is
literally
the length of
rachel ray's television program where
she teaches people how to make easy
meals on weekday nights when they have
kids in 30 minutes or less
he might be a microwave lord
i'm not even trying to it's not i'm not
judging his food
consumption i'm just judging his words
which are
misleading
i'm fine with us ordering if we're not
in the mood we have so many options
stores is near
they do be
so we can always buy stuff there's
always something at home and we can
always do our own thing shortly the
topic bores me to death and started to
annoy the [ __ ] out of me one thing that
has not been touched upon here
is why
are you so annoyed by making a plan
like
the whole discourse and i mean i've
spent a little too much time mining the
paragraph i guess but like the whole
discourse is about like why you
shouldn't have to do it but like
you know what's wrong with it
i just don't understand
you could plan your whole
week in like less than 15 minutes
i i mean you could also have like a wide
variety of food you don't have to have
like five
of the same dinner five of the same
lunch you could mix it up every single
day
being asked every day would annoy me
i'm now you got me nervous because
that's like literally what i do
it might be like 11 a.m and i'll ask
kate like what do you want to do for
dinner
i've it's never been a problem though
but i think the other reason that that
works fine for me is because
i only feel the pull to choose the
dinner like 2x weekly so if she says
like i want to have this i'm like that's
no problem
and if she says i don't really know what
to have i'm like all right i can step in
i can i can fill that void
anyway
the other day she again made a speech
women am i right
just so you know i would it would make
my life easier if i could structure our
weekly schedules so that i could buy the
things i need to buy at the grocery
store and save more time so that we
could spend that time in a quality way
together
throughout the week instead of
constantly having to run to the grocery
store to buy the one ingredient we were
missing because we didn't make a plan
and you specifically want to have
uh vegetable lasagna for dinner tonight
man
just do it come on
making a speech that i need to tell her
this is such like i hate that i'm going
in too hard but this is like such a
little kid energy the other day she
again made a speech that i need to tell
her what i want to eat
so stupid why don't you just read my
mind
so that we can plan and i just bluntly
told her that by now isn't it clear that
i can't and don't want to decide on
these things in advance that she can
just do what she wants and i'll figure
out my own [ __ ] the way i did all the
time this is a great relationship
this is so good
let's just eat our own dinners from now
on because i can't be bothered to tell
you i want to have
soft tacos on wednesdays on monday
she said that if i don't communicate
what i want to eat to her we can't plan
or get all the necessary ingredients i
asked her when did we ever experience an
issue because i expected to eat
something i didn't have ingredients for
and also that i don't expect her to make
food we can see who was in the mood to
cook order have something simple i
finally told her just to never ask this
again that i'm never gonna do [ __ ]
excel sheets with weekly meal plans to
relax and do what she wants
she is now pissed and ignoring me
so emotional
she is now pissed and ignoring me i
can't imagine why
i don't get it
this whole thing seems like a made-up
issue well maybe like i mean i shouldn't
you're literally older than me just to
say
like i feel like i'm like talking up at
this one so i'm kind of embarrassed to
be doing so but
maybe the issue started
with the food planning and then actually
you started swearing at her and telling
her that you never want to do this and
don't ever bring up any issue that you
have to me ever again um that that might
have exacerbated some feelings of
resentment that maybe came up using the
food issue in the first place
that's just the way i'm seeing the
situation but maybe i'm drawing too many
inferences
some additional info both of us are fit
quit bragging
we eat fine no health issues that dot
dot dot that would make her particularly
concerned very scary sentence
i'm at the point where i want to walk
out of the room whenever she asks
anything about food this is the first
time i feel motivated to check the
comments in a while because we are at
34 you're the [ __ ]
27
no [ __ ] here
27 not the [ __ ] this is like way more
of a three horse race than i thought
i gotta read some of the comments that
say not the [ __ ]
i also hate when my stupid mom asked me
to clean my room cause there's rats
everywhere i told you i'm not gonna
clean it i'm my own man
so true so true
my room my rules
most people plan menus in advance so
they can make a grocery list it's not a
weird obsession it's normal you're the
[ __ ]
certified correct
what is this
it's weird because he has not
expectation to be fed by her he is
perfectly happy to decide and eat what
he wants when he wants he doesn't have
to oblige her need to meal plan
do you think that a romantic
relationship is just a roommate that
occasionally you have
intercourse with
you're trying to build
like intimacy and shared experiences and
have conversations and you know build a
life together and stuff like that
it's not do you start eating your meals
you know you don't even eat a dinner
with one another with one another i mean
if that's what you want like if one of
you was like i am a vegetarian and
another person's like i don't really
like vegetarian food then so be it but
like
just because you don't want to fill in
like a little grid with what food you'd
want to eat on like any specific i mean
like you're 34 years old i don't even
want to be like a [ __ ] about it but
like you're 34 years old sometimes you
don't get to choose what you're going to
eat 15 minutes in advance of when you
eat it you got other problems like
it's that's like how uh like my literal
baby feels about food
it's like yesterday we got vietnamese
food we made her up a little plate of
the vietnamese food i chopped her up a
little bit of the pork chop we gave her
a little bit of rice we we gave her a
little bit of like the the noodles from
the fall like chopped up so that she
could actually eat them she went to take
one bite and was like i hate this give
me pasta
she's 16 months old we gave her pasta
there's no reasoning with that there's
nothing you can do when you're 34 years
old sometimes you just gotta be like
okay maybe on
the occasional night i'm gonna have to
eat like my second favorite food instead
of my favorite like it's just
it's just very surprising to me that
someone could make it 34 years on the
planet and still have this kind of like
juvenile attitude
anyway we can i think we can collapse
the top level comment not the [ __ ]
but sorry no [ __ ] here no [ __ ]
here but i absolutely could not live
with you when two people are having
meals together it's normal to plan in
advance it's less expensive
and ensures both people are happy my
husband and i plan for a week ahead as
do most households as going to the
supermarket every other day is a chore
some people wouldn't call it a chore
some people would see that as a value
judgment some people would call it a
hobby
or a lifestyle
filling up the anecdote machine for
uh future streams i mean i i don't see
why you had to be so offensive to me to
call my lifestyle a chore but okay you
do you
luge
87. i still don't think it's no [ __ ]
though it's not even like i think he's
kind of an [ __ ] for not
at least trying to make a food plan for
not at least making an effort once
but like
i think he's definitely an [ __ ] for
like being so annoyed that she wants to
do it
that he got so mad he told her to never
effing bring it up ever again
like that's the red flag
your girlfriend's level of planning
around meals does seem exhausting and
unnecessary and i get why it annoys you
now i am not like a detail-oriented
individual
but
this maybe it's because it appeals to me
but it doesn't seem exhausting to me
to at least come out with like five days
of meals
because it's not really 15 meals like
you're gonna probably eat the same thing
for breakfast every day you're probably
gonna eat roughly the same thing for
lunch every day you're really just
planning like dinners
and even then like
is
it how long does it take to be like what
do you want to have
this week
it just seems kind of crazy to me
oh no having to compromise
i don't know i guess i don't know food
means different things to different
people
i'm just always it's not like uh you
know i grew up in the school of hard
knocks or something like that but i just
love to eat
so as long as like the food is cooked
and
there was an effort to make it taste
good
i don't really care if it's like roast
beef and mashed potatoes or like a
vegetarian chili or you know turkey
sandwich or whatever like it's all i'm
just like delicious every day i'm like
wow this is really good and i believe it
the whole time
i've only lied about it a couple times
in my entire life
i just did it as long as it you know it
food is designed to taste good
people people g people talk
i mean i'm not that i mean no [ __ ]
here i imo but i don't understand how
people can shop for food without knowing
what they're gonna eat on sundays our
meal plan for the entire week and go to
the supermarket once i do feel like
before i rule on this i would love to
see this guy's garbage can slash compost
bin because i feel like once a month he
throws out like
35 worth of groceries
like a bag full of spinach that he used
like one time
i'm not saying i've never done it but
like
it just seems like you have so much more
food waste if you're not planning that's
my that's my hunch at least
info do you ever use ingredients she has
purchased planning food can mean less
waste okay hold on he replied the one
comment basically saying he takes her
pantry staples and some of her fresh
ingredients
if he feels like she has too many of
them for example if she has a whole head
of broccoli which isn't really even that
much broccoli that would drive me insane
if i were hurt this man is treating you
like you're a crazy nag and
simultaneously benefiting from and
undermining your meal planning i would
be livid
that is so funny if he's actually
taking from the food that she bought
with her owned planned meals
in order to make the meals and then he's
also saying
when have i ever had the struggle to eat
oh man
this is actually fantastic
info do you share a food budget
hold on
info i don't want to see info i want to
see judgments
not the [ __ ] you are both totally
correct i identify with both of you i
feel like this you're a coward
he's
the [ __ ] like
without being
too judgmental
you're more like this guy he's a 34 year
old man who said
i like to eat
uh what i want to eat
but i only know 10 minutes before i'm
hungry like it doesn't make any sense
i don't know like this one my ruling is
grow up
honestly your girlfriend should break up
with you it sounds like
you don't respect her and that it's this
is just um
an issue where all those feelings are
being poured in it's not really about
the issue
about the issue you're being a big baby
and it sounds like even when you wrote
it which probably made you sound as
sympathetic as possible she sounds like
the person who's the protagonist and you
sound like a big [ __ ]
so in reality it's probably even worse
you're probably like sulking because you
got to eat a delicious meal but it
wasn't exactly what you wanted like
you're 34 years old grow up
i hope that story's fake
okay a lot of stories have already been
deleted by mods
for example
am i the [ __ ] for asking my mom to
pay my fiance after she canceled her
makeup for our wedding
and people talk please am i the [ __ ]
for asking my mom
to pay my fiance
after she
my mom
canceled her
my fiance
make up for my wedding anyway the post
was deleted so we'll never know
am i the [ __ ] for only continuing to
pay for my adult children who have
started families
[Laughter]
maybe
hello reddit very nice to meet you
oh
you sweet summer child
i'm writing to ask you about an ongoing
argument i'm having with my fourth
daughter who i have been told to call
emma while on this subreddit
in short i've devoted myself male 64 to
my career
and future family since i was 17 and
started my first savings account and
i've managed to accrue quite a bit but
not an infinite amount of money i have
eight children
five daughters and three sons and
they've been the true lights of my life
ah i've paid for all of them to be
properly educated and all expenses up to
their 21st birthday
that's nice like that's a good thing
my issue is this when my second daughter
was 19 she fell pregnant and i made the
decision to help her financially with
the child after her 21st birthday i've
been supporting her family since and
eventually made the rule that as long as
any of my own children had a child the
financial support would continue until
said child
turned 21.
you ever hear the um
the expression in economics that is
you show me the incentives and i'll show
you the outcomes
but how many grandkids you got
just be honest you you got
72 grandkids
there's no way you don't have 72
grandkids
every kid pushes the can down the road
that you get supported for another 21
years
this is incredible
anyway
the amount i pay includes rent food
tuition and a modest monthly recreation
fund
since since then five of my children
have started families all early
i mean honestly if the government wants
to like up the birth rate they should
read this post
we're out here paying like two grand for
daycare there's like i'm not saying it's
hard to have kids like financially i'm
not gonna be that guy that's like pay me
money because i have a child i'm just
saying like having kids is expensive
this guy has single-handedly like raised
the birth rate in the united states of
america just by turning on the money
printer
no of course they're having kids early
which is not even necessarily a bad
thing but of course they're having kids
early
if they know that all of their needs are
going to be supported for the next 21
years
my youngest daughter is not yet 21 so
she's covered as well but my fourth
daughter emma and my youngest son have
not had any children emma has taken
umbrage with this
she is married and considers her pets to
be her children
however her pets do not require tuition
or a recreation budget or extra money to
live in a child-friendly area
she claims that i am pushing her into
having children she does not want as she
is child free well look
this is actually she's kind of right
again i'm taking this almost too much
from like a
a spock
viewpoint
but you are
kind of you're you're exerting force
in the direction of incentivizing her
having children that doesn't mean you're
forcing her but i would say it's a it's
a literal pressure
i mean if you could maybe get like you
know
fifteen hundred dollars a month for 21
years just by having a child is
certainly that's a pressure whether you
consider it a positive or a negative
i just feel as though as a
college-educated woman with a two-income
home and very few responsibilities she
is able to take care of herself my
youngest son has not made any complaints
emma says that is favoritism and i'm
trying to force a lifestyle on my kids i
do not believe i'm in the wrong here but
my youngest son has guided me here to
get a less biased opinion
youngest son is a redditor
you ever thought maybe you should have
stopped at seven
you hate to see it
well then reddit am i the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] 61 not the [ __ ]
29.
this is [ __ ] up man
okay
like
i don't think
this is this is a tough i'm going into
the comments that's why i took the
screen off for a second here
it's tough okay i don't wanna i don't
wanna poison the well by putting the
comments up yet
why would he be an [ __ ]
that's my that's my first question and
the only answer i can come up with is
that not all eight of his kids are
receiving the same level of support
what i'm about to say might be annoying
and some people you have the right to
disagree with me here
but
it also seems like
not all eight of his kids
have the same level of need
i obviously i can't speak to
what the lifestyles of all eight
children are
and some people might have
expenses that they incur that are
unnecessary some people might have
incomes that are higher than others
but like i don't
i mean
again i'm not in this position
but i would feel like if i had siblings
and they had kids and i didn't and my
parents were like we kick them a little
extra
every month like as a result of that i
would be like that makes a lot of sense
i would i would like to think that i
wouldn't be upset
if the if it was like eight grand a
month
i might adopt at that point if i were in
the position too
because i mean that's
it it does i mean i almost feel like i
need a little info here that's like
you know
[Laughter]
how much money are we talking
because your description of the money
was
not infinite which is literally like the
highest real number that you could
create is within that upper bound so
i don't know
either way
i don't feel like
i would like to think well i don't know
like when would i start to be a a little
annoyed i guess if like the money being
paid
as a subsidy for having a grandchild was
like
more
monthly than the salary i made i would
probably be like what the [ __ ]
i don't know this is a really
complicated
question but also i don't know maybe i'm
like you know the millennials were
constantly being pulled by the boomers
towards pulling yourself up by your
bootstraps and pulled by the zoomers to
like you know we gotta treat absolutely
everybody fairly right this is like
it's a very difficult
crystal ball for for someone to look at
i feel like if she's
she's not a kid
like she's over the age of 21
maybe even
older than that like
how long do you expect your
your parents to pay your rent tuition
and a extra fund for
incidental recreational activities
why don't his kids just support their
families too you see this daughter's
trying to blow up the subsidy for
everybody and that's what i don't
respect
i'm putting a lot of i'm i'm doing some
character assassination without even
really knowing who she is
but i feel like she's trying to tell the
teacher that they forgot to assign
homework
if you're the other siblings you gotta
be like oh shut the [ __ ] up
we'll all kick you like
we'll we'll each pitch in 10
of our
monthly slush fund and give it to you as
hush money and then everybody comes out
in the green right like we should
there's got to be a way to work this out
that doesn't lead to the whole thing
being torn down because your dad's like
oh we got to be fair to everybody so
nobody gets a subsidy anymore
so if you just if everybody could just
kick in a 10 of theirs we wouldn't have
a problem
okay
anyway i already know where reddit's
gonna be on this but you know what maybe
this is an opportunity for me to learn
something
maybe this is an opportunity for me to
learn something or just shout we'll see
you're the [ __ ] you can't base
support on if your kid has a kid or not
either do them all or do none of them
emma's right look
i think you you
whether or not you
can
maybe you could say you should or you
shouldn't but you definitely can
i mean you can kind of do like whatever
you want you could just give your
favorite kid a lot of money
it's called a will it happens all the
time
you don't have to i mean i think it's
i don't know if we're ready for this yet
i haven't really thought about my
opinion on this before i started saying
it
but i don't really think that in a
situation like this you have to treat
all of your kids equally
probably some of your kids
are
working as hard as they can being
grateful
giving you phone calls dropping off with
homemade apple pies and stuff like that
and some of your kids probably only call
you when they need that recreational
fund
topped off a little bit why should you
have to give all eight kids
the same amount of support
i feel like the ones who are grateful
for it
you give them a little bit of extra
sauce on top and the ones who are like
you know thanks for the money dad see
you in two months maybe they get cut off
a little faster
it's bad parenting
i don't think it i think it would be bad
parenting to keep
a kieran culkin from succession
sucking on the money pipe for like 30
years without developing any
real skills that can allow them to
become self-sufficient
they're like kids in their their
children
on a literal sense but they're adults in
a literal sense as well
suck session so true so true i'm not
watching succession yet i just have an
ambient awareness of it
did the reference compute you're the
[ __ ] yes it's technically your money
and you can throw it at criminals and
gangs if you want
but ethically you're basically teaching
grown adults to procreate for the sake
of handouts and you're teaching your
other children that they aren't going to
have equal support from their parents
unless they procreate that your love is
conditional on whether
what are you talking about
oh if you really love me pay me 4 000
dad what are you talking about
you're teaching your already grown adult
children almost all of which you have
kids themselves already that your love
is conditional
what the hell are you taught this is
insanity
you can clean up the situation by
actually making it about the kids here
let me buy your kids their back to
school supplies or let me pay for their
babysitting so you can join the whole
family on the trip as a gift for the
kids you saying here's 500 which you can
use on whatever you want because you
have kids is not for the kids all right
so the problem that you have is not with
the money the problem that you have is
with the accounting
as long as instead of giving them 500
you buy them 500 worth of toys then it's
not a problem anymore
as long as hey
as long as you're not giving them 500
cash and instead you're just buying them
like a dolce gabbana backpack to take
the preschool then there's nothing to
worry about
ps5 is for all the grandkids yay
hold on take me back
you're the [ __ ]
this goes way above and beyond just
helping out with extra expenses of
having children you're paying for their
entire life you're basically spoiling
your children with families while
completely stiffing your children who
don't have kids extreme favoritism
this is all true but i think you might
be saying that because you're not the
favorite
i think
you got to evaluate this from a
utilitarian standpoint
seven people are very happy with this
arrangement right now
one person's got all the problems
read the reply okay
it's hardly a surprise all of his kids
ended up being parents so young op
basically told them not to worry about
growing up because he would take care of
them
yes that's true that's definitely true
that's pretty true
and yes and
i mean we're in a strange situation here
where people younger than the child
in this post
are giving parenting advice to the
parent who is old enough to be their
great grandparent
it's like 16 year old kids are like
you're teaching your kids who are 50
percent older than me bad life lessons
you're the [ __ ] so you selectively
help your children based on their
willingness and ability to reproduce
you've been telling your youngest kids
their lives aren't important to you they
don't matter their futures don't matter
i don't think anybody's saying that
their futures don't matter
just maybe that you know
it doesn't matter
thirty two hundred dollars a month worth
just it matters maybe a little bit less
you're the [ __ ] for financially
incentivizing your children to have
children before they're 21 no these
fight at least get it right he's
financializing financially incentivizing
his children to have children the day
after they turned 21
not before then you're wasting some of
the window because you've got an overlap
between when you would be receiving the
subsidy and between when your child
would be receiving the subsidy the
optimum way to do it is to have like a
c-section appointment for the day after
you turn 21 and then you're covered
until you're 42.
and you don't have to lie in your post
they would be far more stable
financially if they waited with or
without your temporarily extended
support and making it conditional on
doing something excruciatingly costly in
the long run is counter to their best
interests
this post just makes me mad because i
i'm not mad at their opinion i'm just
mad that they're lying i actually think
that they basically have the most stable
job of all time
literally all of their
fixed expenses are being handled for 21
years as soon as they have a child well
you could think that's [ __ ] up i mean
it is a little weird don't get me wrong
but like
what do you mean is not in their best
financial interest
i think it's absolutely in their best
financial interest
that's why they're doing it so early i
assume
it's honestly it's kind of like i
wouldn't do that but i'm like it's kind
of sick like if one of my friends had
this deal
i would be like dude you're so lucky i
wouldn't be like wow your dad really
screwed up he's got your priorities all
messed up i would be like bro look at
this
look at you
can we do mario red it makes me so mad
[Laughter]
soon
i just like it i and again i don't have
a good answer for this but it like it
just annoys me that
very few people seem to be like yes you
should pay
your other daughter
the subsidy
everybody just seems to be like you're
paying your other seven kids too much
shut the [ __ ] up you're gonna ruin a
good thing
at least be like it would be fair to pay
everybody that i can at least meet you
in the middle on that one when they're
like you're by giving too much money to
your adult children you're
making their lives too easy i'm like
yeah shut up dude you jealous like this
is a sick setup
you're the [ __ ]
oh dude here we go
i understand what you're trying to do
but does emma never want to have kids if
so why isn't she getting a recreation
allowance that's true okay
you know i mean you could give her like
a little bit
people that get more because they have
children piss me off just because they
choose to procreate doesn't mean they're
entitled to free child care tax breaks
extra sick days leniency on being on
time extra stimulus check getting a seat
on the bus priority boarding on the
plane
let's go through these
they shouldn't be entitled to free child
care
any any offerers in chat
just offering this is an option if if
there's an option for free child care
that's been subsidized by the government
i sure as [ __ ] haven't seen it
tax breaks i don't know that might be
true i don't know if it's true up here
but i'm assuming it's true in the in
parts of the u.s extra sick days i also
don't know if that's true leniency on
being on time look on principle i agree
everybody should be on time okay
but like
is
sometimes
your kid you know poops her pants you
change her diaper
and then as soon as you put her new
diaper on
she poops her pants again do we want to
have a society
where like somebody's like sorry you got
to stay in your shitty diaper for eight
hours so i'm not three minutes late for
work or do we want to have a society
where when [ __ ] happens we're like oh i
understand
if it becomes a habit we'll talk about
it but in instead like i understand
sometimes real life pops up
getting a seat on the bus
yes
if if somebody gets on the bus with a
baby or a little kid
they should get a priority seat on the
bus
that's just insanity that you're like
i'm not giving up my seat for a baby
who are you
ann rand like this
come on
priority boarding on a plane
you want the families to have priority
boarding on an airplane
you don't want to be
in your seat and then have like a
three-year-old kid have to
squirm in past you to get in their seat
you want the kids to be sitting down
plus with priority boarding
i mean they get overhead bin storage i
guess but like why do you want to sit on
the airplane and just stare at the ads
on the screen until takeoff
you could be sitting on that airplane
for like an hour before it actually
starts to taxi out
anyway like i agree with some of those
but like the bus just makes you sound
like a sociopath
if like a 10 year old gets on the bus
i would probably give up my seat
do i think you're a bad person if you
don't give up your seat no
but if like a mom
you know with a stroller gets on the bus
and you don't give up your seat
that's kind of like i mean that
says something about your personality in
my opinion
go ahead be mad it's so unfair for those
people who choose different paths in
life
it's not people without children's fault
others have chosen a difficult lifestyle
of parenting i can understand why emma's
upset look this is true but also
like it
you're talking about a different seat on
the bus
oh no i have to stand up on the bus
because somebody has any look we don't
need to go down this road too much i'm
getting short-circuited again i can hear
[Laughter]
the mine jammer has popped on
i love
too many line breaks is also scary it
makes me feel like i'm being shouted at
with clap emojis
i'm shoveling snow keep the hot takes
coming
i'll do my best is your money do with it
as you please however supporting
lifestyles for your other children
because they procreated is pretty shitty
bad look you're supposed to write bad
look there also do you look at the
accounts for the families with children
to make sure they're spending the extra
money on their kids otherwise what's to
say they aren't taking that extra money
and using it to get their hair done i
got the hair done
check my nails baby how you feeling
i know lizzo i i you can't sneak in a
little extra lizzo reference without me
knowing it
why should emma have to save up her
recreational things when you're paying
those with kids to do them why is emma
getting shorted life experiences because
she doesn't have kids what i mean is the
family wants to go to the grand canyon
you pay for the trip emma wants to go to
the grand canyon emma has to save up and
pay for said trip that's shitty shorting
emma's experiences because she doesn't
have kids kids don't make you entitled
to the extra perks of life
now
this is a situation where she's
literally talking about people with
children being paid like
a substantial monthly salary to have a
kid
i think they have a point in this
situation
i resent the framing
that as soon as you have a child
a whole new world of tolerance uh opens
up to you where people are like oh you
have a kid here take my seat on the bus
here's free things don't pay your taxes
this year big deal life gets so much
easier dad is like i think you're living
in a fantasy world where you're the main
character who's also a victim in this
one situation i do think you have a
point
i can't even read chat is scrolling it's
not that it's scrolling too fast it's
that usually it's emojis
but now in react chord it's always
essays so i can't finish a full sentence
um
before that scrolls off on my screen
also why are you a certified
proctologist what is this does that mean
you have like you've received a certain
amount of awards in uh
in the am i the [ __ ] subreddit
certified proctologist i want to see
like the first not the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] you're punishing your
other children for being responsible
about birth control
look
is it i forgot about this part of am i
the [ __ ] where you can't just
evaluate something on the issues that
are presented i'm guilty of it too but
they also add in like one more thing
that's like what if you know
your dog you're you're punishing your
daughter for like
not making the climate worse and i'm
like
sweet do you see like another oil tanker
exploded off the coast of nigeria
yesterday we're talking about like
grains of sand
versus enormous beaches at this point
like we gotta
we don't just have to
posture in this
sort of way we could talk about the
actual issues at hand
are you trying to start your own weird
family cult by bribing them to have kids
just rude honestly
you're the [ __ ] but softly aka i
don't read
why don't you give her the recreation
money too she clearly doesn't need the
rest but it would be a good compromise
honestly
that might be a good compromise that
seems
op seems quite reasonable look at this
this isn't about monetary support but
about the way you're making your
daughter feel less equal for her life
choices i agree families with kids tend
to have higher costs and as generous
you're supporting them but you're making
your daughter feel like feel like she's
the odd one out maybe offer to pay for
part of it yeah this is all very
reasonable it just hates that or i just
hate that we had to scroll down
so far to get to like the the actual
solutions focused whereas like the first
12 posts were like you're a bad father
i'm like it seems like he's doing a
pretty good job
i bet his kids would give him high marks
in this in the father of the year survey
quite frankly
you're on reddit what'd you expect
that's true
that's pretty true
info if one of your children was
infertile would you support them
financially or not
it did you see what i mean about like
you can't just debate on the issues
instead you come up with your own head
cannon that paints someone in like the
worst possible
light that they could possibly be in
this situation did not happen but
hypothetically if it did how would you
react
don't think three two one come on that's
you're just
you're just looking for a reason to be
upset at this individual you could be
upset because they're not paying out an
equal share
you don't have to like make stuff up to
be mad at that's what twitter's for
oh man
am i the [ __ ] for making i love the
boyfriend girlfriend ones because the
ones that are like
am i the [ __ ] for calling my wife a
[ __ ] like those ones are sad because
you're like legally kind of like locked
in
at least you know there's consequences
to getting out of it the boyfriend
girlfriend ones are just funny because
i'm like man you should probably not in
all of these circumstances but like
there's like two answers one is like you
guys should just talk to each other
instead of the internet and then the
other one is like you should definitely
break up
am i the [ __ ] for making my
girlfriend pay for everything after she
implied she does
oh that's juicy that is juicy
me29 and maddie have been together for
three years we live together maddie is
an anesthesiologist and i own my own
landscape design company our budget is
35 million dollars
due to me working mornings and being
home earlier i do most of the shopping
and cooking we split all other duties 50
50 and pay 50 50 on all bills i make
solid money but most of it is put back
into my business so i don't have as much
spending money as maddie maddie likes to
think i'm some sort of trophy boyfriend
okay first time was when we were out
with her family she's the pride of her
family because her family never went to
college let alone medical school maddie
says op does most of the housework so
i'm not overwhelmed when i get home
maddie her aunt said maddie it's amazing
you snagged yourself a trophy boyfriend
while working so many hours then
maddie's mom said look at you finding a
man who supports you maddie said i'm
glad i can support the both of us okay
the ant made a joke
if you take offense to it that's fine
the mom literally said something nice to
you
i will say
it might annoy me if
my girlfriend said i'm glad i can
support the boss both of us because that
is an insinuation that
you're a you're a single income
household when he is clearly also
working and i i don't know the financial
situation of his business but still
that's that's kind of over the line
she told her friends she was treating me
to a vacation her mom's her friend said
wow maddie sugar mama out here
again okay so like
she's
kind of misrepresenting the relationship
to her friends
all of her friends comments seem like
very nice so far
they don't seem like they're like hey
your deadbeat boyfriend is like so lucky
to have you it seems like those these
are just polite comments wow maddie
sugar mama out here that's just funny
that's okay
i told matty how uncomfortable it was
she told everyone she was buying the
trip her response was i was being
ridiculous because we're a team
okay my parents asked how we were
enjoying the new place we recently moved
maddie started going on about how much
more house it is and how she's thankful
for my help and willingness to support
her career a couple things about how
supportive i am how my job is tough on
me i don't find it that tough
see a
a blue-collar worker not calling their
job that tough
and anytime i say it on stream
everybody's like go bad take bad take
straight from the horse's mouth
apology accepted
and how she's thankful she's able to
cover the house while i build my
business afterwards my parents called me
to ask if everything was okay if my
business was struggling and if maddie
was having to cover for us they could
help out i said maddie spent more on the
down payment than i did but in no way
did she cover our house
i brought this up to maddie and she sees
no problem she says i should be glad to
have a girlfriend who makes money and
wants to splurge on me so i haven't paid
for a thing in the last four months date
nights tickets grocery wi-fi gas nothing
i stopped cooking so now maddie orders
food for us whenever the bill shows up i
say she's got it or whenever i need gas
hey babe can you get this one i'll cook
your favorite food later though
maddie hasn't said anything but i think
she's getting annoyed so last weekend it
was me her her sister brother-in-law and
parents when the bill showed up the
waiter gave it to me i said i'm actually
the trophy boyfriend so i don't pay for
things and handed the bill to maddie on
the way home she was being standoffish
all she said was you didn't have to do
that i said i covered half my bills paid
for the dates bought her gifts and
didn't like she implied she pays for
everything i said if she wants me to
quit doing this then she can tell
everyone the truth or she can keep
paying am i the [ __ ] is actually
hilarious
i don't know i don't really think he's
normally i i talk about how like this
petty stuff is
unnecessary and kind of makes you seem
like a [ __ ] here i'm like i don't
know i'm kind of like
i think you taught her a lesson quite
frankly
four months is like a really long time
to keep this
bit up
don't get me wrong like
he did it for like a couple weeks or
something like that i i feel like she
would get the point but four months is
is a little excessive
but at the same time i'm almost like
this is too funny to make you the
[ __ ]
like he brought it up
and she was like don't worry about it
and then she kept doing it
and then he said okay you know
let's embody the lifestyle that you're
pretending to have
i think i don't think he's necessarily
done anything could he have done
something that would have made both his
and his girlfriend's life easier
yeah
like they
are in on a house together like they
split the down payment and yet he's
rolling the dice
don't get me wrong
but
i don't think he necessarily did
anything particularly wrong it's kind of
like uh like and everybody sucks here
but also i think he's right because he's
hilarious
oh man when you got the bill i actually
i'm the trophy boyfriend so i don't pay
for things oh man
you want the wheat thins go get them
i'm not even looking at the comments i
don't want it to shatter my worldview
because the real the top answer should
be like you should have a talk
that's true
but this is really i i just want to end
it like there for this story because in
my head
that's what they're going to be like for
the next 40 years and that's like more
interesting to me than them solving the
problem
maybe one more good one come on one more
good one
one more good one am i the [ __ ] for
invading my daughter's privacy and
mocking her
am i the [ __ ] for saying you must be
feeling pretty dumb right now to my mom
oh
man
oh
man
i got a job last august and one of the
things my mom said to me that is if my
grades slipped she'd make me quit what
age how how old are you this is so
important
you got to be like 15 right
she parroted this throughout the entire
year despite the fact that my grades
never really dipped at any point anyway
finals came and actually managed to
score an a minus average instead of my
usual
b plus average
naturally i was pretty proud of myself
for that so in a conversation i went
looks like my grade hasn't dipped this
year you must be feeling pretty dumb
right now
that is hilarious
you wanted to see me
do bad in school and then be forced to
quit my job mom you don't have my best
interests in mind this is how the mind
of a teenager actually works is how my
mind worked when i was at that age
god my mom wants me to eat dinner that
she cooked for me after she came home
from a long day at work
anyway sorry
you get over it at a point i think
unless you're that 34 year old guy who
hates meal planning
initially since this was something i
said in a clear joking matter
but she ended up not saying anything so
i was like sorry
then she got really mad at me and said i
called her dumb so i told her she
misunderstood my joke but as usual she
refused to listen to me
oh man i heard her tell my sister did
you hear what your brother said and he
was trying to justify it now i know what
he really thinks of me and your dad and
she said this as if i wasn't even there
so at this point i was really angry
because i know she's gonna tell everyone
about what i said and probably gonna say
that i especially called her dumb my
sister said i shouldn't have made that
joke in the first place because she's my
mom and all i could think was she can
say that i'm a stupid and irresponsible
layabout straight to my er but as soon
as i prove her wrong i'm in the wrong
for it f off but am i the [ __ ] here
to begin with this is so good
this is great
edit so a bit of a harsh response but
honestly taking what's been said here to
heart i was being an obnoxious little
jerk one thing that really resonated
with me is i kind of assumed my mom
thought i was stupid which caused my
misplaced resentment in the first place
as such i decided to apologize
immediately she didn't anything at first
but then she went on the golden rule
saying
treat others as you want to be treated
anyway she forgave me and seemed like
she was in a much better mood thanks to
everybody who participated character
development yeah hey
applause easy clap
at least you know there's a learning
lesson in there
but like i did i i don't know i almost
feel the need it was probably like five
percent of the chat but i do feel the
need to say like
i don't think his mom did anything wrong
seems like he's a teenager who got a job
and then his mom like so he's in high
school and then his mom said
i'm gonna make you quit the job if your
grades slip
it doesn't seem like
she was saying like you're too stupid to
have a job and
be in high school at the same time it
was more like school is a higher
priority but you can hold the job as
long as your grades don't
don't suffer as a result that just seems
like good parenting honestly
seems like a normal situation i don't
know why he would i mean because the
teenage brain is like you know
it's still growing
you think everybody's out to get you
you thought i would you thought that the
child that you put all your effort into
raising over like the last 17 years is
dumb
you want to see me fail for absolutely
no reason that makes any coherent sense
whatsoever but i showed you
by getting an a minus average
anyway he's just a teenager it's okay i
mean if he's 30 it's like you know it's
a different story
bet you feel dumb right now oh man i
could never though
i always think that my mom's in my
corner i would never take a success of
mine and be like
oh man i can't even like just thinking
of it in my head gives me chills
bet you feel pretty dumb right now
i would probably laugh as the parent
but i would not do it as a as a child
that's crazy
anyway slash marker
react court feels good



people were right for a certain amount
of time but are now incorrect we're here
to judge people again and it's not just
because we have too much sap and too
much switch sports in the hopper and we
need a little variety coming out on
youtube it's because i've decided that
today we should fight it's that simple
you make me look at my reddit 90
comments asking me why i'm not playing
rogue legacy too i look at this reddit
and i channel that energy that could
have been destructive into something
productive making fun of other people
it's perfect okay does the screen region
look good i think it does
maybe the text is a little small but let
me read it to you
am i the [ __ ] for keeping track when
i was told by older people that i would
understand things when i was older and
emailing them examples of how they're
wrong now that i'm adults what an
incredible place to start
i've kept track of most of the people
who told me you'll understand when you
grow up after getting my degree i
started emailing a lot of them with
counter examples and research things
like being punished for being bullied or
drawing on notes some religious
intolerance not getting paid for working
when i should have and a few others my
old principal literally emailed back to
me with your older but you're still an
immature [ __ ] so i decided to ask
here
um
world's world's sanest person
just dropped i look it depends
like obviously
first off how
good did that feel for the principal
obviously when they're a student that is
like
under your jurisdiction
you have to be nice to them as as much
as possible but as soon as they leave
the confines of the school grounds
you can say what you really feel
he must that must have been the greatest
email he ever got in his life when he
opened it up and then was like i can
finally thanks for letting me know your
email address so i can freaking go off
on you
um
this is
does it make you an [ __ ] i mean i
don't know if you're really like that
big of an [ __ ] hello daniel sorry for
the swears by the way we're doing some
react court
this is somebody who uh they're asking
if they're the [ __ ] because their
entire life they kept track of people
who would tell them they would
understand when they're older and then
when they became an adult they emailed
them back with counter examples uh i
don't know five to twenty years after
the fact depending on their age
this is not i mean i don't think it's
that
much
of [ __ ] behavior but it is a little
bit psychotic
i can hold a grudge
but to hold a grudge
to somebody from like you know your
teenage years
into adulthood and then
basically try to get them try to own
them
afterwards is is just it's an unhealthy
fixation at the very least
they're in positions of power over
others particularly children the
particular wrongs were for the most part
harmful in the case of the principle i
was bullied and punished for being
bullied multiple times then expelled it
was in a houston suburb school where
fighting is extremely common however
even when i was hit i wouldn't fight
back they even ended up with a recorded
video that ended up on youtube showing i
didn't do anything except drop to the
ground and cover my head the video is
what got me expelled for being involved
in a physical confrontation this seems
like one of those things you shouldn't
be em emailing your principal
and saying like um
here's all the times you were wrong you
should be taking like the school
district to court and suing them for all
their worth
now that i know you're in the united
states of america you should
hire a lawyer and give the lawyer the
youtube link and then tell them that you
got expelled for it and sue for
emotional damages
your your only problem is having tipped
off the principle that the lawsuit was
coming
it followed me to college also i'm
jewish and i was told that complaining
about being harassed was something i
would have to deal with and to suck it
up by a teacher at the school this is
the the case writes itself
your teacher
i don't know if i'd go so far as to call
it a hate crime but she definitely said
something uh pretty unjustifiably
insensitive to you
you need to you need to take these fools
for all their worth
in regards to the payment issue it was
my first job and i didn't realize they
had to pay me if i still worked after
they closed the doors when i brought it
up they said they couldn't afford it and
answered above as the principal did to
justify their reasoning this is one of
those things this is like um
it's an everybody sucks here and i'm
sorry that happened to you genuinely
situation
you should not be emailing these people
with your long-held grudges you know
um
when when you hold a grudge you know you
you damage yourself more than you
damaged your your the object of your uh
malevolence
that being said it seems like you went
through some nasty stuff i like this
more when and this always happens when
we do react chord um i liked this more
when i just thought that they were a
little bit kooky uh but instead that
like maybe just a little bit petty but
this actually seems like just a terrible
situation so
um we're gonna move on i don't know i
would say everybody sucks here
you still
shouldn't be emailing them this
but also i think uh
that that shouldn't happen to you in the
first place
am i the [ __ ] for not refunding
clients because of my weight gain
hold on i gotta i gotta make sure i got
the right screen region here
your clients
i'm a classical belly dancer i did i
didn't know you could be a classical
belly dancer like like chopin or mozart
or or what
tchaikovsky
korsky korski rimsikov
i also offer classes when covet hit i
emailed all my booking and i offered to
refund their deposit when it became
clear that we were in for the long haul
some of my clients chose not to take
back their deposit and they postponed or
modified the booking switched to a
virtual performance okay
i um
this is not meant to be super judgmental
it's just an observation
who is
watching a virtual belly dance
virtual
therapy sure virtual meetings virtual
in-class learning
but can you imagine just sitting there
like with your
with your family watching a ver i guess
for classes like a virtual belly dance
class
but uh i mean it's the same camera angle
of me when i played switch sports
bowling right
one of the bookings was for a wedding i
usually can audition or simply provide a
sample video the clients wanted to
postpone until they were able to gather
with hundreds of people which was a few
weeks ago i did audition i confirmed
that they wanted to keep the same
routine and they said yes since then i'd
gained some weight for context i'm 5'4
pre-covered i weighed about 130 pounds
and now weigh about 160 pounds my weight
does not affect my performance i was
able to perform the full choreography
and routine
weight does not matter specifically in
belly dancing i'm active i was not out
of breath or sweating profusely and i
was professional however after i had
issued the invoice i received an email
from the bride and groom saying i didn't
look the same as what i did in the
audition and i didn't fit the aesthetic
of what they were going for for that
reason they don't want to pay
um it's the easiest like not the [ __ ]
of all time
you didn't do anything wrong
[Laughter]
like
let's just ignore
let's pretend this was not a situation
where um obviously it's more sensitive
because it's about some person's body
but like you can't if you're if you go
to like pick up a car let's say you
signed a car you're about to sign a
contract that you're gonna buy a car if
they say hey come in and check it out we
finally got it shipped from uh
grand rapids and then it's like you know
it's a different
paint job than you thought it was gonna
be or you wanted to get the st and
they're giving you the sc or like you
know one of the rims is a little scuffed
it's up to you
to look at the car and then go
this is not what i ordered
i am not going to take possession of
this
until it is what i ordered so we're
going to like just call call this whole
thing off you don't get to sign drive
the car home
and then be like
oh now that i have the car i don't want
to actually make the payments on it
look isn't it it's not a great metaphor
it's a clumsy metaphor all i'm trying
i'm not trying to say that people are
property all i'm trying to say
is if you're unhappy
with the service that you're going to
get and it's apparent you don't take
possession of you don't have the service
happen and then just go
i don't want to pay for the thing that
we already got you got to stop it before
it happens
i work at a bank and people do this with
cars well yeah people do a lot of things
they like you know murder other people
but this is am i the [ __ ] court and i
think that makes you the [ __ ]
you have to refuse the service before
the services are rendered that's where
the insanity comes in
yeah murderers are the [ __ ]
i just don't understand uh
i don't understand the counter argument
here usually there's like some division
i don't understand how they could not be
the [ __ ]
also who cares like if you'll forgive
the the
rawness of the verbiage who cares if
your belly dancers put on some weight
it's not like
that's not what it's for
right
i thought it was just like
wow look at the way she's rolling her
belly
rolling her body like jennifer she's the
star of my liquid dreams
i mean it's called a belly dance
i sort of don't get yeah is it a wedding
or a bachelor party
i just don't understand
check the percentages so i can see it it
says not the [ __ ] 60 which is
basically for the dan viewers that's
like a super majority on on am i the
[ __ ] usually it's like you know 30 30
30 10. it's like 30 not the [ __ ] 30
are the [ __ ] 30 everybody sucks and
then 10 is like you i should never be
allowed to perform a business service
again because you've betrayed them uh
with you when you sign a contract you
have to adhere to everything by the
strict letter of the law according to my
father who i respect but don't love
anyway
this one is i'm here's my thing
obviously not the [ __ ] this one's not
that interesting i think you just
encountered a client from hell
am i the [ __ ] for having a lights out
wedding
it's an essay it has five edits and
sorry it has four edits and an amendment
okay okay
now i was i go off on the op and then
i'm like i read paragraph two
being raised by blind parents wasn't
without its challenges
how am i supposed to
go in on this
we'll read it anyway okay
because i'm not scared
i can't call you an [ __ ] i will say
this post is labeled [ __ ] though so
i'm interested to see where we go with
this
i-27f am the daughter of the most
amazing parents that ever did a mace no
they are not perfect but they've
literally done everything they could in
their lives to make sure i was happy to
the best of their ability they are also
both blind being raised by blind parents
wasn't without its challenges but we
always found solutions or compromises
one thing that was always a point of
contention was clothing and fashion my
parents have found their own way of
being fashionable and rather than
appearance it's fabric or feel this has
resulted in them having a very eclectic
sense of fashion but honestly i love it
i admit that i hated it as a teenager
as i had no say over my own my own
wardrobe purchases but i realized that i
did prefer to feel comfortable in my
clothes over how i looked in them took
many stupid expensive clothing purchases
to realize this but i digress nothing is
mismatched anymore but i have a super
cozy wardrobe with the wedding planning
in full swing my fdh asked me
my fdh
isn't this
the measure of the gathering format
father
is not fat dumb husband future dear
husband
when did that get
added into the into the acronym uvra
future dear husband
future doting husband
all right
i'm going in
asked me if i was gonna be okay with the
photos he did not mean this maliciously
it just didn't occur to him that i was
originally planning to buy them clothing
to wear
but the more i thought about it the more
i thought wouldn't a fabric wedding be
special
essentially the whole wedding will be in
the dark
i was inspired by that restaurant in the
movie about time i realized i don't want
to dress my parents i want them to be
comfortable and to enjoy our wedding the
way they experience it and the more i
thought about it the more i realized i
wanted to experience
the special day as they would too
my future dear husband honest to god
does not care in his mind the moment
i said yes i became his wife open
parentheses i love him to avoid
accidents we're going to use glow stick
lighting and everyone will be provided
globe bracelet necklaces
they light up enough to not crash into
each other but not so much
it's just like
it's just a lot man
i i don't i get i don't want this to be
like to seem insensitive but how many
guests you got coming to this man
you got 200 guests coming to this so
that your
parents don't have to put like a suit
on i don't understand
like it just seems if i were the parents
i would be like overly
i would be uncomfortable because i'm
like overly accommodated you know like
when you go over to somebody's house and
they're like what do you want for dinner
and you're like oh whatever you have is
fine and they're like well we should
really just choose we can also go to the
grocery store and get whatever you want
i'll pay for it don't worry and so do
you have any dietary restraints or
they're like oh just let me vibe
i'm just trying to vibe not to mention
like it's your special day
this just seems like a like this is a
lot
to do
just for i mean two people that are very
special to you don't get me wrong but
like
it's it would make me uncomfortable if i
was the mom or the dad i think
just my two cents
we're also hiring event staff with night
vision for this equipment night vision
you got
sam fisher man in the open bar
there's
that's amazing
i don't believe that this is real but
it's kind of amazing
like also you can just do that
i guess if you had a wedding planner you
could be like hey just talk to like some
catering companies and like add in a few
grand for night vision i guess or
something
when we announced most of the family was
supportive my family goes without saying
fiance's family is iffy his brother
loves the idea and is going to come in a
velvet suit allah austin powers honestly
it's his parents that are really against
it we had a huge fight over it when they
argued it's not fair to punish the guest
because my parents are blind i don't
believe that they said that i don't
believe this is real
do i believe they might have said
something that was like i would like to
see my son on his wedding day
i believe they could have said something
like that did they say
it's not fair to punish the the other
guests
i would be surprised
now i don't know them and one of their
kids is going dressed as austin powers
so
maybe that's an indictment of their
parenting to begin with the reason i
think
maybe
the [ __ ] the reason i think i may be
the [ __ ] is because part of his
family that is siding with his parents
are vowing not to boycott if we don't
have lights
my
not to boycott my husband just thinks
it's their loss and that his parents
will attend even if begrudgingly but i
know it would hurt his relationship with
them and i don't want that
it's not that this is a hill i'm willing
to die on but it's my wedding i don't
know why that's in quotation marks
and this would be really special to me
in quote oh in quotations because my
husband
has told me he'd marry me in
the in a walmart if that's what i wanted
he just wants to marry me
in quotations because my husband has
told me he'd marry me in the in oh
walmart if that's what i wanted he just
wants to marry me that's cute that's
good for you guys i'm happy
edit i feel like i keep seeing these
points get brought up so i'd like to
address them edit to all the haters who
say i'm crazy and should die
i just want to say a few things we hired
a wedding planner whose literal job it
is to make sure this event runs smoothly
and safely is she like xcia or something
because i feel like logistically this is
even it's like a normal wedding
but like all the difficulty that goes
into a normal wedding but then with like
a little nathan for you veneer on top of
it
they are literally being paid to factor
in any contingency to ensure the safest
experience
there will literally be staff wearing
night vision goggles monitoring every
table to ensure everyone's safety that
makes me feel less safe to be honest
with you
the fact that i will be observed by like
15 people who are the only people who
can observe what's happening at the
event makes me feel a lot less safe
quite frankly
i feel like i'm i'm in like guantanamo
bay or something like i'm i don't wish
to be observed
there were 200 invites sent out and 121
have rsvp'd yes each table is set to
seat six so at this time we're paying
for 20 extra hands to cover the tables
for 121 guests this isn't counting our
table or the exits but like
i'm just cons and i forgive me for
asking these questions so you
they're seating so this is the reception
this is not the ceremony this is the
reception
so they're bringing you your food and
you're eating but there's also like
speeches
so like when it's your turn to give a
speech
someone's gonna step out of the abyss
and like grab your arm and be like you
know oh mr letourneau
it's time for the best man speech please
let me guide you
to the
to the
pulpit
and then you're gonna be up there giving
a speech in the dark like it just
doesn't
it doesn't seem
sensible to me
also i feel like my eyes would hurt when
i left this the ceremony
sorry i forgot about the glow sticks
but still how do you know where like the
staircases are and stuff like that
the glow necklaces
oh oh never mind here we go i've heard a
lot of people imply that glow bracelets
and glow necklaces won't be enough
having been too many nightclubs and
raves in my teens and early twenties i
can promise you that 121 wearing these
is enough to see with and the staff will
manage the rest concerning tripping
hazards and directions okay so like
literally it's just all of your
complaints mean nothing because in my
head i've already decided that it's
going to work a lot of the year the
[ __ ] comments are making very valid
points that being said i'm also making a
list of strong points to go over with my
planner tomorrow but for those people
whose only argument is they wouldn't be
comfortable not being able to see that's
literally the point you're not supposed
to see
if someone came in a giant furry sully
from monsters inc not the pilot dumbass
i'd be thrilled when i ran into them the
wedding isn't going to be focused on
visually enjoying the experience it's
about hearing smelling tasting and
feeling it can i tell you something
tasting sure
i do enjoy going to a wedding and
tasting the food
i don't want to smell the wedding i
don't want to touch the wedding
here is also a pretty good one but
really i'm going to see the wedding
predominantly i just
it's not that this isn't like an
interesting idea for like uh
like a fundraiser or something like that
but like
why is it merging
with your wedding i guess is the thing
that is the
that is kind of like why does this have
to be involved in the wedding
it just doesn't make sense to me because
of the parents
yeah but like
i mean i just don't i guess i just think
that's an invalid
reason
[Laughter]
i'm not gonna tell them like what causes
they should or they shouldn't
take up i feel like if the parents were
like renewing their vows
it wouldn't make
sense and be cool
to be like guess what we're gonna do
like a a lights out wedding
and then you'd be like oh we went to
this lights out wedding
and it was neat it was this experience
where the people that were getting
married were blind and they wanted us to
like have uh
the ability to understand that
this just seems like
like it's not your parents day
you know like maybe it's something you
could do for like their it's like your
50th anniversary you rent out the legion
and you do a lights out party for them
or something like that but it's like
it's your
it's your wedding
they want to bond with their parents
they're 27 years old they could just
it's just weird you know it's weird to
me
like if if kate and i do like a bigger
ceremony at some point if we renew our
vows
i hope my parents will be there
my mom
she's a plant-based eater
she doesn't need any cooking oils she
doesn't eat any dairy
i'm having steak with blue cheese on it
there'll be a caesar salad served on the
side
and it's not that i want to like screw
over my mom
it's my day
it was our day
i'm signing the damn check
when you and you know how many meals i
had that uh
you and dad picked out for like the
first 18 years of my life i'm picking
this one
it's your day on your wedding you should
do what you want
and i think that she's doing what she
wants
but it scares me i guess okay sorry
amendment to number four
please know when i said that's the point
i didn't mean the point to be
uncomfortable and i can see how it came
across that way
i want to apologize for that that being
said
what i meant is it's the point to attend
with limited visibility when people tell
me they're uncomfortable with not being
able to see it sounds the same to me as
if someone said they're uncomfortably
uncomfortable being naked at a mandatory
nudist beach
if you're attending you're attending
knowing you will be naked or in this
case nearly blind
so making a complaint about not being
able to see knowing it's a light outs
event lights out event doesn't make any
sense to me
they're not
they're complaining because they don't
want it to be a lights out event
what are you taught what are you saying
what do you mean it doesn't make sense
to you they're like well the thing is x
and they're saying they don't like x so
i don't get it
i'm i'm out of here man she's saying
don't come well like that wouldn't be i
wouldn't even respond to the rsvp to be
honest with you if if this ended up in
my mailbox
scrolling past some some terrible ones
[Laughter]
oh man
am i the ass this is one because we some
people were like 50 50
on the last couple let's get everybody
back on the same page am i the [ __ ]
for making fun of my brother-in-law
after he lost a [ __ ] ton of money
investing in cryptocurrency
now we can all be on the same page again
we can laugh at and all my apes gone or
something
so my
sister-in-law's husband
this just for simplification in the
future is also known as a brother-in-law
he's a bit of a braggart and gets off on
boasting about his money and the things
he's bought with said money me and my
wait no is this you
your sister-in-law's husband
your sister-in-law's husband
your brother
your brother-in-law your brother your
sister in-law his husband
it's his wife's sis his wife's sister's
husband
okay that's his brother-in-law
yeah yeah we're okay all right we
figured it out
me and my wife aren't exactly struggling
but we're not as well off as them every
time we visit them he'll pull me aside
to show off whatever new gadget he
bought whenever we go out to dinner with
them he'll insist on paying in the most
condescending way possible he'll also
try to give me financial advice which is
just annoying
my wife doesn't like him but she puts up
with it because she's very close to her
sister i'm kind of close to my wife so i
put up with it for her
so we got into crypto and shortly after
nfts i work in finance and have learned
a decent amount about crypto i'm not
some expert but it doesn't take a rocket
scientist to see how it's a ponzi scheme
when he brought me this advice we argued
on it he accused me of not wanting to
give my wife the life she deserves
that seems like a rational sort of uh
economic argument
he also said that he was going to make
his family millionaires and called me
naive for not wanting to join in i don't
know if you all have been watching the
news lately but a lot of cryptos aren't
doing so hot we hosted them for dinner
it was awkward there was some tension i
couldn't tell why in a period of silence
i asked him so are you all millionaires
yet
in that moment my wife's sister put her
head down into her hands and was in
tears in seconds her husband explained
this is not true this is
this is not safer work writing but
that's okay
in that moment she was in tears in
seconds her husband explained he bet
money he couldn't afford to lose on
cryptos that crashed he lost a [ __ ] ton
of money and said unless they figure
something out they won't be able to stay
in their house or pay for their two
daughters preschools
i was immediately met with a glare from
him and my wife
when they left my wife accused me of
being in a dick measuring contest
against him and said i took it too far
this is not real
this is not a real
story this yeah this is our slash that
happened
on i wish it was real
but it's not real if you're gonna make a
fake story could you at least make it
insane he took me aside and told me that
he put all of his savings uh into this
cryptocurrency which has crashed 99 over
the last six days but told me not to
tell
my wife of course we're married so the
first thing i did
was tell my wife and she told my sister
and now he's threatening to beat me up
am i the [ __ ] like that's a story
that i could be like you know what i
could sort of believe it
but
this one is just it's it's just too
mundane
am i the [ __ ] for telling my partner
that her kid has a father and i'm not a
cash cow
for deadbeat parents
this has been deleted okay well
how about this one am i the [ __ ] for
ruining easter by agreeing with a
self-righteous little brat that i am a
devil worshiper i before i even
load this story up
i love when adults get tilted by kids
especially like if it's a 14 year old
shirt like you go off on them ruin
easter or whatever but if they're like
nine
i just i just gotta know i gotta know
more about you that you let a kid get
inside your head like that
okay
here we go
am i the [ __ ]
for ruining easter by agreeing with the
self-righteous little brat that i am a
devil worshiper a little background i'm
28 and i live in a big city and yard
space for entertaining is a luxury i
inherited 10 acres of land for my
grandfather which he bought in the 70s
it's a dream location for an easter egg
hunt and 90 percent of family events are
held on my property there's two houses
on the property my house that i built
two years ago in my grandfather's house
which has remained untouched since he
died i am an atheist and you will not
catch me in a church but i have no
problem celebrating religious holidays
like easter if there's food involved
well that's big of you
my dad and his wife are more active in
church than most of the family my family
was getting together for easter and my
dad asked me as a favor to let my wife
invite her church friends for an egg
hunt after lunch i reluctantly agreed
the pious kid who i thought at the time
was 12 to 13 from his size but later i
found out he is nine let's go baby
i knew it
yes i got rattled by a nine-year-old but
in my defense he looked like he was 12.
okay when i yelled at him and let him
ruin my family gathering i thought he
was 12 which would have been way more
sensible
he asked me why i never go to church
keep in mind i never met this kid in my
life but somehow i assume that a
nine-year-old is just a small person who
has an adult's wisdom inside of their
brain and will never ask anything that
crosses the line uh
so i can only assume he has heard
something about me from my stepmom all i
said was church was not my thing he
asked why not i said a different
viewpoint and he wanted to know what
religion i was i said i do not belong to
any religion and i consider myself an
atheist he asked what the is that and i
said i do not believe in a higher power
from that conversation he told me i was
a devil worshiper i was like wtf
i told him i sure was and in the house
he would see my animal sacrifices
mounted on the literally the way this is
written is that this nine-year-old kid
made a joke
like he bantered and then the dude went
full [ __ ] psycho
just trying to scare him
it literally sounds like the kid was
just trying to like
get you to giggle a little bit or play
around in conversation and you're like
yeah well i
uh drink goat's blood
and you can find it inside of my house
you have to go to the bathroom
he asked what okay hold on we went
further
he would see my animal sacrifices
mounted on the wall
i told him everyone thinks i got those
deer from hunting but they really are
sacrifices this kid lost his
you-know-what he ran screaming to his
mom i was a devil worshiper and
sacrificed animals
he was crying with snot running down his
face okay congrats big man you owned him
at first my dad and stepmom did not get
what the kid was saying because i don't
hunt the deer mounted on the walls
belong to my grandfather my dad asked
why does this kid think you are a devil
worshiper killed deer
i told him the kid was nosy and made
assumptions that i agreed with i got
yelled at by this kid's parents they are
yelling at me red face and i cannot stop
laughing telling me about my prosperity
and that i'm evil
i told them to go take their
superstitious [ __ ] off my property
i am catching so much hell which is
crazy to me because this just seems like
a normal situation
drama llama stepmom is saying i have
humiliated her in front of the entire
church and she will never forgive me i
told her i don't care and reminded her
that i only tolerate her my dad wrote a
public apology on his facebook on my
behalf
there was some backlash from the family
and he deleted it i feel a family
meeting coming on which i won't subject
myself to literally
so
from about the age of 20 onwards if you
don't get a law and i mean like you're
cool with your family but you don't
really
have that much relatability with them
there's a little challenge called
be nice and normal for four hours every
six months
you have taken it to difficulty degree
impossible
for for reasons that i can't even
understand
all you had to do
was not be a weirdo around like the
nine-year-old kid
i don't mean like a scary weirdo i just
mean like way too intense
like it really sounds like the kid was
just joking around
and then you got offended that there was
a nine-year-old christian
and and you sought to own him in the
marketplace of ideas i just don't
understand
like when he said are you a devil
worshiper why wouldn't you just say you
know no i don't believe in the devil
either just like maintain like an even
keel
i don't i just don't get it
i wonder what the tone of the
conversation was
he's nine he's a nine-year-old i'm not
saying a nine-year-old kid can't wrangle
you a little bit but like
he's nine
it's not possible for a nine-year-old
kid to ruin thanksgiving
even if he does something that ruins
thanksgiving it's the response of the
adults around him
that chooses how the tone of this event
is going to go down
it's his parents like you maybe you can
rag on his parents a little bit but i
also don't think he did anything it
doesn't sound like this kid did anything
wrong
okay okay find your house your rules but
like
host easter without making it like a
weird soapbox 2022 challenge don't get
me wrong it's funny i think this is one
where i gotta like
i gotta go look at the at the original
post
this is dude reddit is full of people
that are psychotic
not the [ __ ] and to be honest my
favorite part is when you reminded your
stepmom you only tolerate her it's your
family like
instead of just constantly trying to
like own the people closest to you in
the marketplace of ideas you could
literally just be like i'm sorry
and then never see them again like i
don't understand why
like what is wrong with you
900 people sorry 9 000 people upvoted it
i've altered the deal pray i don't alter
it further op probably 3.1 thousand of
votes
so true dude hippity hoppity get off my
property op apparently so
freaking true now that i get it okay
not the [ __ ] and ignore every single
[ __ ] on here saying that you are the
kid should have been taught better not
your problem you have more patience than
i do there's not a snowball's chance in
hell i would have agreed to allow a
bunch of religious people onto my
property and the moment any of them
attempted to spout their religious
nonsense off they would have been
escorted off my property
he's nine
sir we received a 9-1-1 call um
saying uh oh my god on this man's
property
this is cr you would have been escorted
off my property if i had people that
loved me that came to my house which i
don't own for a barbecue which i don't
have
and they
said something that even slightly
rankled me because everything's about me
and i'm the main character i would
escort my own father and mother off of
my property
all right it's not my pc this a blender
okay
if you hear that and i'm not playing pub
g it's a blender if we are playing pub g
then it's then it's my pc
is is it that the kid should have been
taught better or did somebody put the
kid up to asking in the hopes of shaming
op back to the church
to me that is even worse but it's not
that's not what happened so you could
just
not like that it did that he's nine he's
a nine-year-old kid
he asked
he the kid asked do you go to church
because this whole world probably
revolves around the church
you think it's a a false flag operation
from jesus christ himself
to me that is even worse i'm not above
cutting off family if they would push
religion on me
i'm a firm believer that having religion
is like having a penis it's fine to have
one but no one wants to see it or talk
about it without the other person
bringing it up
my brother in christ you just brought it
up
i
don't
it just doesn't make sense to me
i oh dudes
mikey thank you
man i feel like everything blew up based
on a kid that you could have ignored or
told politely to go pants pound sand
given that i think everybody sucks here
i feel like someone ends up not sucking
but here i think it's everyone including
you
even if you get labeled an [ __ ] here
i bet you'll be asked to host events a
lot less often
downside you didn't do anything to help
improve an already negative stereotype
of atheist which you easily could have
done at least look i don't agree with
necessarily everything that he wrote
here but at least this person lives in
the real world
where people have you know slight
differences in opinion but can get
together for three hours to eat
delicious hamburgers because that's more
important
real world individual
i agree with your general assessment but
let's be honest one convo with a random
stranger isn't going to do squat for
kids with a parents like his
you don't yeah
it doesn't have to
you're never going to see this kid again
as long as you live oh
let's go
a little super food smoothie berry blue
blueberry creamsicle smoothie featuring
hold on
spirulina
it's delicious yeah it's fantastic
it's got courgettes in it
said it's got zucchini in it
delicious
i feel revitalized
i'm i'm losing it man
show the smoothie it's in like a it's in
a container you can't see well there you
go
i was about to win a league of react
court game dominating them mid lane in
the marketplace of ideas when my wife
brought me a smoothie not asked for but
much appreciated hey zaria thanks for
the gifted subscriptions thank you
every i also feel the need like to go
one step further and i might lose some
of the plus twos i had on my side for
this
so many people are ready to go in and be
like it's on the parents for not
teaching their kids not to ask
inappropriate questions
i feel like if you're a nine-year-old
kid and your entire social life is based
around like where your parents take you
and they take you to church
it's kind of like a pretty normal
question for a little kid to ask someone
that's different is like why don't you
go to church
that's not an inappropriate question in
the slightest
that's it's honestly
if you were in that bubble that's kind
of an astute question to ask because
you're trying to get a different
person's viewpoint that maybe could
teach you something
i don't understand the idea that like oh
the parents really screwed up raising
this child like he didn't the kid didn't
do anything wrong
okay he called him a devil worshiper but
this guy's an atheist you don't get
offended by that
don't don't pretend to be offended to
act like you're the victim in a
situation where the other party is nine
it's pathetic
not the [ __ ] and no more easter egg
hunts based so much more time for path
of exile you're the [ __ ] but it was
funny
not the [ __ ] this is the best story
i've ever heard jesus loving kids gotta
learn not everyone believes in him
i'm i'm so sick of these kids coming to
my favorite restaurant red robin and
making noise having so much fun with
themselves where they don't even pay for
the meals i've got to pay for the meals
all these kids going to see the pixar
movies at 1 p.m on a saturday making
noise in the theater
this is crazy man
i'm scared by how many people agree with
me that's usually a sign that i'm in the
wrong
i'm trying to find some good ones what
time is it 12 30 okay no problem
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting my
husband to work from home i believe that
this will be good
they're eating too many damn bottomless
fries
okay
some background i worked minimum wage
jobs all through his schooling and the
agreement that down the road he would
get a higher paying job and i could live
my housewife dreams of spending my days
baking gardening and cooking delicious
meals look
you're all you need to
you gotta
speak to your audience you gotta read
the room this is not the way you should
write this sentence on reddit
reddit predominantly
15 to 45 year old
men who look like me
militant atheists like myself
when you write a sentence that basically
could be misinterpreted as
i worked minimum wage jobs for a little
bit and then my husband is going to do
all the work while i sit at home and do
nothing except for all the domestic
stuff which is actually still very hard
as i found out since we've had a baby
this is you've already put yourself so
far on the back foot hello josh by the
way hello
recently he got a job he really wanted
but he was nervous because they weren't
willing to pay him much i was in full
support because i want him to work for a
company he feels good about and i'm
content to live a low-cost life we were
both under the impression he would go
into the office most days for the first
six months and then two days a week
after that on his first day they sent
him home after three hours with all his
equipment and told him he could work
completely from home i'm struggling
because we live in a tiny studio
apartment and now i have to tiptoe well
he's in virtual meetings all day i was
excited to have the house to myself and
now i feel like the rug has been pulled
from under me but i know it's a real
privilege to not have to work so i'm
conflicted i've expressed to him that i
need space for my sanity but he says
it's selfish to ask him to commute and
work in an empty building for several
days a week this is a weird one for me
okay
i don't think anybody involved in this
situation is an [ __ ] and that doesn't
happen too much on reddit
i think it's okay
for her to be annoyed that in a small
space
she doesn't get to feel like she's
actually at home because basically her
husband is also there working so she has
to change her activities
i think that's a reasonable thing to be
frustrated about now you can be
frustrated about something but still
you know be like this isn't the best
part of my life but everything else is
still good and i'm content
if she was like if if she is pushing him
and maybe there's some inference here in
this paragraph if there's if she's like
please go into the office then maybe
she's an [ __ ] if he is
happier at home
um but i think this is a no [ __ ]
here man i actually don't think this is
as spicy as i thought it would be
i thought this was gonna be like i
realized i hate my husband so instead
i'm gonna um
i want him to go back into the office to
save our marriage instead she's like you
know
this dude's in virtual meetings
eight hours a day so i don't really feel
like i'm at home but i recognize that i
have a good life anyway
couldn't need a bigger place don't get
me wrong i i don't i this is no [ __ ]
here this strikes me as a
a v and s this strikes me as a very
normal situation
okay this one's deleted but man i wish
that it wasn't because
um am i the [ __ ] for telling a girl
to stop pretending to be a mermaid
am i the [ __ ] for telling my sperm
donated nephew he's not part of our
family
what
i don't even i i just want to know more
i'm not making a judgment yet i just
want to know how this happened
i have an older brother who i've been
estranged with for a long time not even
sure where if he lives at this point
don't really care apparently when he was
in his mid-20s he sold some sperm to a
clinic for easy cash we know this
because his spawn
why
like this just why write it like that
like i was so i was going along for the
journey with you
and then you you self-reported as like
an anti-natalist
or you just say his son
spawn what it's just so condescending
tr recently tracked my family down after
taking one of those dna tests he was
unable to contact my brother no shock
there but found me on linkedin reached
out and we met for lunch
based on his messages originally i
thought
my brother knocked someone up and
abandoned her but at lunch i found out
he was conceived using donor sperm he
does look a lot like my brother did when
we were younger but based on his
origination i don't feel any sort of
familial bond if i'm being honest i have
my own family that i care about deeply
and i don't really need much more
all of that strikes me as fair quite
frankly maybe ridden a little
condescendingly but but fair i guess
i guess jake is feeling an identity
crisis not knowing where he came from so
he wanted to meet when i met him i told
him that by the way i would not have
done the lunch meeting that is one of
those messages i would have left on red
i think
but
maybe that makes me even more of an
[ __ ] but like i feel like if i'm
putting myself in the shoes of the
author here what did you expect to gain
from the meeting
because you already called him spawn
instead of like a human being or i could
have maybe like
well let's have a phone call before we
go out to lunch or something like that
like
you don't have to start with like a
meeting where he like knows your face
and like you know maybe follow you back
to your house or something like that
it's just
it's the same guy who blew up that nine
year old
no not yet i guess jake is feeling his
identity crisis from not knowing where
he came from when i met him i told him i
would though i feel weird about it i did
feel like i should at least meet him to
share the limited info i know about
family medical history okay sure
i told him but it was clear he wanted
more he asked about my weekend plans i
told him i was on easter duty and
hosting an event with friends and family
what at my park that my grandfather uh
gave to me in the inheritance there's
two houses on it
is it it maybe is the same guy
he asked if he could come meet my kids
and some other relatives i told him
sorry it's too weird
i have no ethical qualms about sperm
donation or any of that
but i feel like it makes a difference
that he was created that way so i told
him no and then i don't want to pursue
another meeting with him
you just get yourself into trouble the
more you talk i think that's a universal
truth the more
if you can say something in one sentence
and not elaborate until asked
you're going to be a lot better off than
if you say that second sentence i don't
have any ethical concerns with like
sperm donation ivf etc etc
you don't need to put the second part
which is that it makes too much of a
difference that you were created that
way so you're not part of my family
he seemed upset but left with no
incident
it's another like thing you commonly see
on reddit right
which is that like any time somebody is
upset you expect it to be a public
freakout moment
he didn't kill me but he was emotionally
affected by this moment
then lately he's reached out again
telling me i'm treating him like [ __ ]
when we're technically family i told him
no again he wouldn't stop pushing so i
told him i don't consider him family and
i'm blocking him and he reached out if
he reached out again i would speak to my
attorney my wife thinks i was too harsh
but agrees we shouldn't maintain contact
it'd be weird to have him meet our kids
my friend however thinks i'm being kind
of an a-hole because jake is clearly
having an identity crisis honestly
i after everything we've been through
i don't think he's really like an
[ __ ] i think he's
i think he kind of sucks
but i it within the specific
situation of like of the
the encapsulated issue on this one i
don't think he's the [ __ ] for being
you know cold called
by
his brother's child who was fathered by
us via sperm donation and being like
nice lunch but i don't really want you
in my life i don't think that's an issue
he just sounds like a guy everything
he's writing makes him sound like kind
of a jerk but that doesn't make him like
a
a bad dude in this it doesn't make him
wrong in this specific situation
he called him a spawn yeah but i think
he's like not wrong you know
like sure i don't think he's treating
him as a
a person
like with the respect that a person
should be treated with
but i also don't think the meat of the
issue is incorrect
you know what i mean
like i think he's being not i think he's
being fair but not nice
i don't think that makes him the [ __ ]
i think he's being harsh but fair
like when that guy told his stepmom he
only uh he only merely tolerates her
i'm being honest i think this is a
nobody sucks here
oh wait sorry yeah nobody sucks here i
can also understand
why you know jake would be going through
an identity crisis and we would be
trying to meet up with uh some people
that maybe could give him an anchor
point where he could reverse engineer
part of his identity
he's clearly rich though what does that
have to do with anything
why would he not help jake because he's
got his own freaking problems he doesn't
even know who this kid is
jake's
basically a 23 year old stranger it's
not this guy's responsibility to be like
i'm gonna fix him
he speaks got his own stuff man the
sprinklers are broken got to get the
winter tires taken off the car he's got
his own kids maybe like you know people
are busy
i can fix him
he's his uncle though
like kind of
like genetically speaking yeah
but like
doesn't jake have like some other
uncles that are like from the family
that he was raised from in the first
place via the sperm donation
like where's the where's the family that
he was with in the first place
for like the last 23 years
that raised him from from zero to 23.
see now you're filling in your head
canon
you're like maybe they're all dead well
we don't know that
maybe they're actually the nicest people
of all time but jake uh sold all their
appliances and fenced them to get drugs
to
buy guns
and now he's trying to find another
person to do the exact same scheme with
maybe they're all dead and jake killed
them he doesn't know because he's a
stranger which is why
you know you don't
i mean you're like you have sympathy but
at the same time you're like well
i hope that works out for you keep your
head up kid
plus if he doesn't like his brother jake
genetically is 50 his brother so
50 chance he's not gonna like this kid
either also people keep saying he
threatened to sue him he didn't threaten
to sue him he said he would speak to his
attorney about a restraining order
that's probably too far
[Laughter]
but he's not going to sue him he's just
going to say like he's like hey please i
don't want to meet up anymore and then
if the
if jake keeps going let's meet up then
he's like okay i'm going to legally get
this in writing that you have to stay
200 meters away from me he's not going
to sue him
but not the [ __ ]
i don't know chad i don't think you live
in the real world on this one
i think he could have been nicer but i
also don't think he has any obligation
to like
integrate this person into his life
which everybody at all times is always
busy because your busyness does not
change with the amount of work you're
doing it change it scales with the
perception of how much work you're
already doing so ev you're
you your
barometer for how much you're doing
is proportional to how much you're
already doing
i don't think that makes any sense but
what i'm trying to say is you're gonna
make excuses for why this guy
should help someone who's only like very
slightly uh you know related to him i
don't mean genetically but in terms of
like the fact that they've lived their
life but but why you can't do the same
thing even though you probably have a
similar situation in your life right now
you got cousins who were going through
some stuff you could give them a phone
call oh but that is a different
situation i'm busy this guy is rich
cause he has an attorney that he can
email
i think he was doing a fair thing
in a not nice way
that's that's my verdict you don't have
to agree with it
that's the beauty of of react court
so he's an [ __ ]
i don't think an [ __ ] is is just not
being nice
i mean now we're getting more into like
the dictionary definition of what an
[ __ ] is like i think you could be an
[ __ ] and be nice
here's your fentanyl honey like i think
that's an a nice [ __ ] right there i
think you've got to look at this
situation itself and like it's are they
off base
with the way that they're tackling the
situation
and i don't think they were off base i
think honestly i think this guy's just
from boston
and you're the [ __ ] if you're calling
him mean for having a bostonian sort of
dialect
when he meets his like kids he's
probably like hey you [ __ ] idiots i'm
here to pick you up from [ __ ] school
you [ __ ] uh do you why don't you get
it last one in the prius is derek jeter
you know like that's just how they talk
i'm from boston and he i think he's an
[ __ ] do you mean that like because if
you're actually from boston that would
mean like you guys would be great
friends right
that's just how we talk
i hate these like rug pulls man
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to walk my
stepdaughter down the aisle it's always
like am i the [ __ ] for doing [ __ ]
thing and then the body of the text is
like she shot me in the leg last year
okay how about i love these everybody
sucks those are the best
am i the [ __ ] for skipping family
togethers because my girlfriend doesn't
feel welcome
now this is the kind of post i love
because the headline screams not the
[ __ ]
but the reaction so far
says that they're the [ __ ] that's i
love that's a rug push
they have pushed a rug underneath me to
to cushion me and my entertainment
the rare rug push harder to do
yeah like screw that you know you ever
see like a waiter like
take the table cloth off but all the
dishes stay on
i would love to see them
do it in reverse if they could just
push the tablecloth on
without knocking any of the dishes over
that would be impressive man
my family and i used to be really close
i used to be close with my parents as
well as my three older sisters because
we all live close by my parents enjoyed
setting up either saturday or sunday
depending on everyone's schedule as a
day just for my siblings and i had to go
over to the parents house hang out and
have a meal this is very nice
i brought my girlfriend let's call her
morgan
over to one of these back in october
let's call her morgan let's let's dig
into that a little bit
you didn't have to pick a name you could
have just said my girlfriend
but you chose to pick a name why'd you
choose morgan
it's interesting of all the names you
could have chosen
possib possible that her name really is
morgan or
possible who knows
hello hello
because it is morgan you think it's a
dexter morgan situation maybe he was
watching the dexter remake on showtime
we gotta watch the dexter remake
i don't think i've i've seen dexter
since 2008.
i mean i also heard it was good to be
fair
that is a good point but you know what
is also good two-hour season finale of
survivor next wednesday
she's not excited
probably true
that is probably true
pog though
so morgan was going to one of these back
in october it was their first time
meeting her i'd been dating her since
late july
it seemed a perfect opportunity for her
to meet them in a casual environment
well they ended up just grilling her the
more they learned about her not grilling
her in like a yelling screaming like
grilling sort of manner but doing this
passive aggressive i'm gonna talk down
to you but in a calm tone okay
in the past i've dated girls who were
quiet and studious types all of them
went to college some got master's
degrees and my family hugely values
education
my dad is a doctor two sisters are
lawyers my other sister is a doctor i
have a master's
then my my parents loved my exes okay
morgan's a bit different she didn't like
school she admits her grades didn't
matter she was more focused on the
social aspects of high school doing the
whole where's the party friday i got so
drunk last weekend what outfit am i
gonna wear to school thing she didn't go
to college she was more focused on the
party which for my family was strikes
one two and three
at the family gathering in october once
they figured out she didn't go to
college that's when they jumped on and
made her feel inadequate about it it
seemed like everything they said to her
was a variation of where above you
you're a [ __ ] we're gonna let you know
that for example they said things like i
just can't imagine not caring about
school weren't you worried about your
future those classes aren't hard unless
you don't try they got her in one-on-one
conversations when i wasn't around and
said those things to her oh no it's you
what it is me
yeah but i would never say that to a
person's face
i would just let it serve as the
underpinning of my academic philosophy
which is that there's really no excuse
to not get anything under like at least
an a-minus
in middle school
like you're in class eight hours a day
anyway
like literally just write the answers on
the piece of paper that they gave you
and hand it in
i don't know if you were like cool in
high school maybe you had something
better to do and you're like okay i'm
gonna get like some c's
because these are the best years of my
life but like when you're in middle
school come on
it very much upset her that they would
rip her to shreds over her education and
her job she waitresses it pissed me off
hearing her tell me what they said she
decided she wasn't going to be attending
any more family stuff and strongly
encouraged me to as well
so i haven't seen them since october my
family thinks i'm the [ __ ] because to
them i'm being manipulated to hate them
by a pretty girl with a nice smile and
no goals i'm 26 she's 24 am i the
[ __ ]
i'm a little surprised that this is
on everybody sucks here but i'm i'm
because that's what the verdict was here
can i get um
can i get
the the everybody sucks here in chat
voters to tell me how the guy or the
girl sucks
is it as simple as she does sound like
she's not goal-oriented
she sounds annoying
yeah
well i don't know i don't think that's
really fair like the only thing i know
about her
is that she waitresses which is fine and
then she asked where the party was like
six times according to her boyfriend
which seems like that's probably an
oversimplification of who she is as a
human being
especially when why didn't they just
tell her where is the party
why didn't they just say it's over there
then she wouldn't asked it so much
it sounds like she asked him not to see
his family anymore
okay she she strongly encouraged me to
skip the get-togethers and not talk to
them very much so i haven't seen them
since october all right okay i could i
could see your point
sorry i got some i got some zucchini
stuck in my straw
i can't get it out man
i don't want to get courgette on my on
my pants
got it out i got it out
but i got a little on my shirt
i'm the [ __ ] i'm the [ __ ]
there we go
um
i don't know i mean
i don't i don't think that they suck i
mean look if i look
i know i said look 20 times i'm
formulating my thoughts behind the
curtain okay
if i was dating someone and i was in
love with them and then i went to see
their family and their family was like
uh shitty to me i would do the same
thing that she's doing because you're
building like a bubble where it's you
and your significant other
as like the the number one priority
and i understand that you know they've
only been dating for like four months
but i just don't know if that's how the
human brain works
i think you're like you know
we're we're testing we're running like a
test drive to see if we're going to um
be each other's number one heading into
final tribal council okay
so i i
don't think that she's really that
off base or out of line by
i mean if someone was [ __ ] me even
if they were related to my spouse
like if i went to kate's parents house
and you know they were like
you suck
[ __ ] you i would be like don't talk to
those people so much anymore
whether or not you know it would
actually would actually do it is that's
up to her that's all you could really do
in that situation but like
i don't i don't see her as doing
anything wrong
i feel like he should talk to his
parents and be like can you not
condescend to my girlfriend
and then they will probably have a
conversation well where they're going to
be like oh we're sorry that we we didn't
realize we were being so elitist we just
were surprised because normally you
bring home studious girls um but we
support your decision to date whoever
you want to date we just want to make
sure that um you know this is someone
who you see yourself with in the future
and then they'll like have a comment
they'll have like a meal
and when their belly's full they'll be
more amenable to having like a realistic
sort of negotiation where they'll come
to a solution at the end that that works
it's not perfect for everybody but a
compromise that works
or they would be like no you can't date
this girl she's a waitress and then you
would be like all right see you later
mom and dad or something like that and
then
so that's but even then i think they
made the mistake
like the parents could always reach out
and apologize i'm i'm inclined to give
my stamp on this one and my stamp is
only the parents suck in my opinion
i think that's it
i'm giving this a not the [ __ ]
based on my percep perspective
am i no am i the [ __ ] for no longer
playing a video game with my stepson
after my own son said it wasn't fair
this is a long one
oh no he's a youtuber
my am i the [ __ ] for no longer
playing a video game with my stepson
after my own son said it wasn't fair my
ex now moved my now 12 year old son to
another state against my wishes two
years ago i wasn't able to stop the move
legally so now i get my son all of
summer and breaks i'm not happy with his
schedule but there's not much i can do i
live with my wife thirteen-year-old
stepson and three-year-old daughter my
stepson is obsessed with minecraft and
has recently been making videos for
youtube
i love my stepson a lot and we have a
great relationship he asked me to play
minecraft with him a few times in online
multiplayer mode and the few times that
we have i've done unintentionally funny
things that went viral and got his
videos some tens of thousands of views
he now has around 12 000 subscribers yo
that's kind of sick
that's pretty cool
my son found out about this and also
wanted to have a youtube channel
apparently he'd just gotten into
minecraft as well so i spent under two
thousand dollars on a computer monitor
and recording equipment and had them
delivered to my son's home in the other
state
i felt this was only fair
because i could see where the problem
starts here
i felt this was only fair because my
stepson was using my computer and
recording equipment for my old job then
i also joined in on my son's videos but
i never managed to recreate those viral
moments and that made my son upset so i
tried harder to be funny only to be told
that i was obvious i was pretending i'm
dude
some days you got it some days you don't
some days you can't get the content to
come out
none of your jokes are landing and some
days chib just off the cuff says
something like wasn't denzel washington
that american president who died
you can't you can't have it every single
day
you got to be kinder to yourself
his videos were only getting like 50 to
100 views with no comments that's
there's still like he's 12
that's not that bad
for a 12 year old especially
been there dude
for real like that's still like 100
people watching the video that's pretty
good that's that's like an above average
youtube video i think
it was pretty stressful at this point
for me yeah i mean you're working like
six jobs you got like your own job then
you're a collaborator on two youtube
channels
what are you doing your
your domestic duties man
i think my son sensed this and basically
cut me off from playing with him he said
i ruined the game for him and then if i
play with my stepson then he'll know who
i love more which is ridiculous because
it's not even a contest
i acknowledged how he felt and told my
stepson maybe it's better if i just do
my own things in the evenings and not
play minecraft anymore
my stepson was disappointed but
understood i found out later for my wife
that he cried and felt i was mad at him
my wife was upset and said she didn't
care if i stopped playing the game she
understood why my son felt jealous but
she told me next time not to put her son
down to make mine feel better that it
would have been better if i never
offered a play to begin with i've been
feeling terrible ever since and
apologized sincerely but there's
emotional distance between both kids and
me am i the [ __ ]
um
this just sucks dude i'm sorry for you
seems like a guy who is just trying his
best
well i mean if he's an [ __ ] what
would i have done in this situation so i
feel like reddit is guilty of like
in a broad sense always trying to find
the objective king solomon approach i
would have told my 12 year old son who i
carry a lot of emotional baggage for
because me and my wife got separated and
it was toxic and he was in another state
and i only see him two months a year i
would have told him that he's being
unrealistic and unfair
and uh you know perhaps alienated him
for a little while to continue playing
with my stepson because that's only fair
i don't think that most people would do
that realistically
i think they would try to
find like a compromise i think what you
got to do
is you got to convince your birth son to
be funnier
i think you've got to maybe like instead
of spending 2k on the rig maybe you
could have spent 1500 and then you could
have spent like 500 on improv classes or
something like that so that he could
carry the content on his own and then he
wouldn't need you to come in and make
like viral moments for him
you need to set him up you bought him
the pc but he hasn't got the firmware
downloaded into his mind yet
do improv classes actually work
let me answer your question with another
question
can you please give me all your money
right now cause i'm robbing you
put the money in the bag
what do you mean that's not a bag it's
uh
it's uh it's a taco um oh wow this is
such a good taco
oh my tummy hurts but
i just vomited a rainbow
and scene
does that answer your question
holds up spork
i don't know i just feel like this i
just want to buy this guy
like a
an imperial stout
i feel like he's just he just needs a
hug really
i the [ __ ] for defending my friend
and saying my wife needs to work on her
insecurities
oh
man
these are always good
i've been married to jessica for 13
years we have two girls 12 and 5.
those are weird names man who are you
george costanza i have a female friend
madison who i've known since before i
was with jessica this has never caused
much of an issue because i met madison
through her ex-husband who is still one
of her best friends and we usually hang
out in a group so jessica has never felt
jealous or threatened
she doesn't like madison though by the
way due to clashing personalities she
feels madison and our mutual friend her
ex's wife
look down on her but she can't come up
with any examples and admits it's just a
gut feeling i don't know who to believe
there because other people have told me
they felt it was jessica who hated the
other two women
madison has a glamorous life she used to
work in fashion and married a guy with
[ __ ] you money so my 12 year old has
always been in awe of her there's too
many damn characters man this is like a
robert altman movie
we're on we're on like character nine
paragraph three i can't follow this
was there's so much damn context
she used to work in fashion and married
a guy with [ __ ] you money so my 12 year
old has always been in awe of her just
due to the clothes and the parties this
annoys jessica but we never thought much
of it jessica is more the girl next door
type and looks down on madison for some
of her glamour i just want to have like
a like a a writer's workshop for reddit
don't give
people that are related to you
names in your story
i'm trying to cross-reference who's
madison who's jessica
i thought for a second here she was
married to a woman but she's married to
a man with [ __ ] you money just right my
wife my friend
it's it's too much man
my five-year-old has been having
somebody oh now there's a five-year-old
okay the plot thickens
is there a glossary or something that i
can use like a a family tree to keep up
with this
my five-year-old has been having some
behavioral issues lately so we're
working on that but everyone's a little
tense
madison and her current husband stopped
by saturday after attending some sort of
gala fundraiser because he lent me
something and needed it back
madison was dressed up from the gala our
five-year-old hear the noise and it woke
her up we have been having a tough day
with her behavior my wife was burnt out
she saw madison and said you look like a
princess you are so pretty and your
dresses are so pretty i wish you were my
mom kids are ruthless okay we know this
madison laughed and was like aw thank
you which jessica thought was
insensitive when they left she went off
about what a [ __ ] madison was i thought
it would blow over but she's been
pressuring me to distance myself from
the friendship i argued madison didn't
do anything and it was about a dress not
my wife but jessica says it doesn't
matter what madison did she's my wife
and she's uncomfortable so that should
be my priority today she brought it up
and i snapped at her that she needs to
work on her insecurity
that's productive
was waiting for for the turn to when it
would be the guy is the [ __ ]
no one did anything wrong and i'm
entitled to a life and friendships which
don't get to be dictated by her
insecurities obviously that did not go
over well
oh man
okay
so
um
that this is a a tough family situation
madison did not do anything wrong
maybe
it would have been nice for her
to deflect the comment about i wish you
were my mom and say
no
i wish i was as pretty as your mom or
something like that because you out when
you get a compliment that shouldn't have
gone to you
you should
condo it in the direction of the person
that it should have been given to in the
first place okay but just because she
neglected to do that does not make her
the [ __ ]
it would have made her a saint
yts you're the saint
if she had managed to do that but she
just remains a
totally neutral party in this situation
the kid was the [ __ ] yeah but they're
five he's five years old they're gonna
say things all the time
you can't i mean again it's if you get
mad at something like a five-year-old
kid says that's more of a reflection on
you than it is on the kid now i'll
probably get mad at [ __ ] that my
five-year-old says all the time it will
be a reflection on me i'll be you know
stressed out or burned out or tired or
whatever and i'll be like man what she
said just really kind of pissed me off
but then the next day i'll be like right
she's five
i'm over it right
i know on reddit it's like everybody
should be just treated as an adult in
all situations but um
regardless
i mean this guy is just like
i mean he just he snapped at his wife is
really what it came down to
it doesn't make him like a big
[ __ ] to to snap at your wife
in this situation where everybody's
stressed out
but it does it and maybe this is a
fallacy but it makes you kind of an
[ __ ]
to a greater extent
to snap at your wife
have five minutes to calm down
or more
and then still think you're like so in
the right that you go to reddit to try
to get like an affirmation that you
didn't do anything wrong
that's where i'm like you should not go
to
anytime you find yourself having an
argument with someone close to you in
your life and your instinct is like i'm
going to post about it on social media
and then because what do you think is
going to happen or maybe he thinks he's
just going to feel better about it if
people say they agree with him but it's
not like he's going to print out the
comments and be like see 61 of redditors
are on my side when i told the story
exactly in a way to make it as
flattering for me as possible like
that's never going to happen
you should just try to get like you know
take a deep breath belly breathe a
little bit and then try to work it out
when you get a chance
i mean it's just not a helpful comment
to say work on your insecurity
it's like it's non-specific
both with respect to work on and with
respect to insecurity
it's not it's just not helpful yeah it's
just like when people say do better
like are you saying do better or you
just like you want me to feel bad
because you disagree with what i'm
saying so you're just trying to make me
feel like i'm doing badly
am i the [ __ ] for not dressing up for
my sister's harry potter wedding it's
deleted i would have loved to have read
it
i would have loved to have read it
i love the wedding ones man
because you know what it is every time
i
read um the
the wedding posts
it reaffirms for me
that
getting married with only very close
family
on the second floor of a nice restaurant
was exactly the right way to do it why
are you making this [ __ ] so complicated
i mean you can have a big wedding don't
get me wrong but like
i was at zero risk of this [ __ ] going
down
i'm getting married in my backyard next
weekend
yo meet the parents style
did owen wilson hand carve you a sick
altar i mean that's just cool
i got married at the corner of hastings
in maine
outside
with the lights off
plus mcdonald's has free refills so your
wedding was goaded don't act like you
were there
i wouldn't know if you were there though
because i had the lights off um
it's a good joke it's a good joke okay
hold on hold on
i love this
i didn't want to spend the whole time
typing this out so i'll try to keep it
brief that is a lie
you're here making the post
you can't it just
do you have no self-awareness
your first sentence is already
misleading
and let's not even bring up the fact
that this is long
but like i didn't want to waste any time
typing this out
so here's
my life story i just don't understand
you if you don't want to type it then
don't type it i wouldn't be reading this
if you didn't want to type it
my she's female 21
aunt got married last weekend pog clap
congratulations when i was invited to
the wedding i was told i could take a
plus one automatically decided i wanted
to take my girlfriend jay
chad's gonna love that
the invitations were set out an entire
six months before the actual wedding my
girlfriend was really exited because
this will have only been the second
wedding she's gone to in her whole life
good for her
i remember my second wedding
my family are not the most welcoming of
my girlfriend and i's relationship as
they are very traditional but after a
few years have learned to tolerate it my
whole family knew that i planned to take
jay
however the weekend before the wedding
my mom and i went out to lunch she told
me she wasn't supposed to tell me this
but my aunt had told her she was
uncomfortable with me bringing jay and
she wished i'd bring someone else so
that she could feel more comfortable i
basically told my mom that was bs and we
got into an argument
no bixby that one's not for you i don't
know why bixby went in on that
fast forward to the day of the wedding
and i bring
i bring jay just like i said i would my
aunt avoided me the whole time and i
kept getting dirty looks from family
members later at the reception i was
confronted by my aunt and mom who told
me it was disrespectful of me to bring
my girlfriend to the wedding when i knew
she wasn't wanted there and how i could
make my aunt uncomfortable at her own
wedding they said and i quote i was
supposed to do the right thing and not
bring jay once i knew she wasn't wanted
there right in front of jay okay now
everyone
we're all heavy and i'm not the [ __ ]
here all reasonable people are in on not
the [ __ ] there's still like five
paragraphs left and the verdict was
everybody sucks from the populace so
i'm waiting for the the turn of the
bloom on the rose
something's gonna she pisses in the
punch bowl
i don't know but something's going she's
crashing her car into like everybody
else in the parking lot or something
like there's gonna be a plot twist it
happens every time it should be soon
because she didn't want to spend a whole
lot of time typing this out
so from my understanding my aunt was
probably the one who asked my mom to
tell me she was uncomfortable with it as
it was some elaborate plan to give me to
not bring jay last minute i told him to
suck it and ended up leaving but jay
obviously very upset
i have been
since been shunned by my entire
immediate family circle which was very
hurtful but i'm tired of dealing with
their [ __ ] am i the [ __ ]
no there was no turn
what happened
why there's okay no no i'm looking at
the there's a table below
verdict 50 not the [ __ ] 25
pardon me 25 everyone sucks here
that seems more reasonable from reddit
to me
i mean i also don't think it should be
25 percent i mean here's the thing
i think
when you're hosting a wedding
for you
you have to be
reasonably accommodating to other people
if someone wants to come dressed as a
pirate and you don't want that
i think you could be like
don't be a pirate can you just wear like
some normie clothes
if someone's gonna come on stilts and
they love wearing stilts could you be
like just leave the stilts at home
but asking someone to
not bring
their
girlfriend because you're homophobic
to me is like a violation of your human
rights
[Laughter]
it's like asking someone to be like
when you come to my wedding can you
cover my cover your face because i don't
like how you look
um when you come to my wedding
please don't wear uh the cross around
your neck because it offends me like
it's too much
you've gone way too far
um
you have to live on this world with
other people you have to accommodate
things that may offend you or annoy you
but are within the human being's right
to to practice you know in the pursuit
of their own happiness
so i really can't understand the people
that are like you're the [ __ ]
i don't know if there's people out there
i guess that oversimplify it as like
well you knew it would make your aunt
angry so you should i guess they're
probably gonna say
you shouldn't have gone at all because
you subjected your girlfriend to that
level of homophobia and that is
irresponsible of you so that there's
probably some a little bit of fairness
to that interpretation of you're the
[ __ ]
but apart from that i mean
i mean this is like uh
this is like a gimme you're not the
[ __ ]
i was gonna say everybody sucks here
even if she started crashing her car
into the other cars in the parking lot
the reason i didn't want to not bring
jay is because i knew how excited she
was to go and i didn't want to
disappoint her and also no i did not
tell her what my mom said to me because
i didn't want to hurt her feelings that
seems justifiable to me
for the people asking why my family
doesn't like her it's because she's a
girl and not a boy yeah i think that's
uh
i gleaned that i suppose
all right i mean this seems true true
that's pretty true that's pretty
reasonable
anyway that's react court



the rumors of my death are not greatly
exaggerated i almost died but i'm back
and i'm doing react court i was gonna
say i'm playing react court but that's
not really
um
it's not really a game this is real life
right hello everybody by the way um
we're gonna get started here we it's
been probably close to a month since we
played it so i'm i'm ready to go i'm
looking at like most uh popular posts
from the past month
am i the [ __ ] for not tattooing my
stepson's name on my arm with my kids
names okay a little spicy a little spicy
to start no doubt about that
i'm 36 my wife is 35. rare um one year
age difference on reddit
doesn't happen that much he is older
though so already it's a little
problematic i have two kids with my
first marriage 9m and 7f i've been
married to my wife for four years we
have a one f daughter she has an eight
month son from her first marriage
that's gotta be eight years right
they've been married for four years and
she has an eight month old son from her
first marriage
eight main male eight male okay thank
you i don't necessarily that okay my
mistake that makes sense
the kids all live with us
my kid's mother has visitations one
weekend a month her son's dad isn't
involved at all
eight million sons
what is she like a damn spider
i have the names of my oldest two kids
tattooed on my arm i just recently added
the name of my youngest daughter my wife
and i were talking about the tattoo and
she asked me if i'll tattoo my stepson's
name in the same round as our daughters
i told her i have no intention of
tattooing his name shep was shocked
and asked me why i said i only have the
names of my children tattooed she said i
am excluding her son and he is part of
this family too i refused to tattoo his
name and proceeded to only tattoo my
daughter's name wife called me all sorts
of things am i the [ __ ]
this might surprise you i i love when i
have a take and then i look at chat and
it's the opposite take just scrolling
past
maybe this is like um i mean i don't
want this to spiral into a conversation
with higher order implications but like
i think a tattoo is very much
like a personal
take
it's it's your body
it's your
skin
i think you're not the [ __ ] for for
in any situation for choosing not to get
a tattoo
even like this is taking it to a logical
extreme maybe but if you had two kids
and you only got like one of your kids
names tattooed on you
that's probably
a little
messed up but also i mean it's your body
i think you you have the choice hello
she cried again oh that's okay and then
the
daycare lady was like is she sick
because like she cried yesterday and
then after i left she would be like not
crying and then she will cry and then
she will not cry and then she will cry
and there's like nothing happening yeah
it's okay she'll be fine
she's she's got to go through it in
order to break the
separation anxiety to begin with
she's like mommy and then she gets
distracted and she remembers mommy and
then she was like
oh it's sad for sure
then honestly like so my wife drops my
daughter off at our daughter off at
daycare she cries every single time when
i pick her up she's having the time of
her life
every time i pick her up she doesn't
notice i'm there for like 30 seconds and
she's just with the other kids and
they're like pee
and then they all like toddle over to
this bush and they're like they do the
baby squat where like their feet are
flat on the ground and they bend so deep
that like their butt is touching the
grass and they're all there together
going like
b
hello b
b
hi b
is crazy
like i honestly i think i got the easy
job picking her up
she's she is going sumo
ass to grass like it's crazy don't make
fun of my finger anyway
i mean here's the thing i think this is
one of those things
okay you know you jealous jealous
jealous
i think this is one of those things
where like
is it a little bit of an [ __ ] move
um
to not get your stepson's
name tattooed on your body yes i think
it's a little bit of an [ __ ] move for
sure
obviously from the perspective of the
stepson it does kind of feel like you're
a lesser
child than the others in the eyes of
your stepdad
however i think it's one of those
situations where like if i if you're the
stepdad
i'm kind of like
i mean i have to
take the bullet of being a little bit of
an [ __ ]
in order to
maintain
my own ability to
get the tattoos i choose to get
like at the end of the day
i think it's a very personal thing it's
not like he's not inviting the stepson
out for like you know family dinner or
something like that because he's not
really his son
he's like you know
he that tattoo is very personal it's
it's on your body forever
obviously this guy has been divorced
once so he may be in his head he's like
well
maybe in like 10 years we could uh
we could get it tattooed i don't know if
if i was asked would i get the tattoo i
would probably get the tattoo
i probably wouldn't have to be asked to
be honest to begin with but i also
completely understand like why he
wouldn't that seems reasonable to me
i mean like the most of the time
you should put your own self-interest
aside to
promote the interest of your family
especially your kids
and that includes your step kids but
like a tattoo is very
i mean it's a very personal thing
it's not like they're like hey can you
stop drinking for like one day so you
can drive your kid to softball practice
they're like can you put permanent ink
on your arm
i
i think it's a little prickly but i can
definitely understand their position i'm
gonna say not the [ __ ] to be honest
i know you can get it removed but like
that doesn't that it hurts right i think
it hurts
okay hold on i'm i'm going into the
comments i just want to see what the
comments look like here
all right some of these comments make a
pretty good point
that i didn't necessarily consider
you're the [ __ ] you've been a father
figure to him for half his life poor boy
will probably be shattered when he
realizes you don't actually see him as
yours uh you know uh true true that's
pretty true
have you considered though that
a man should have
the domain over his own bodily autonomy
maybe as the eight-year-old considered
that
a grown man should have the right to
choose what gets permanently etched into
his skin has the eight-year-old
considered that i don't know
same sadly as a step parent myself this
speaks volumes for his relationship with
the kid and how he views them
subconsciously not to sound like one of
those redditors i don't say this lightly
uh
the lie detector test determined that
was a damn lie this comment was probably
written on the toilet
if i was op's wife i'd be doing some
hard thinking about how i was going to
fix this and if i couldn't it would be
divorce i've been the one to question my
place in the family and it hurts and has
lasting repercussions on a person's
mental health so now like let's flip the
script all of a sudden you're the
stepdad in this situation uh your wife
comes to you and says hey get ours steps
get your stepson's name tattooed on your
forearm or we're getting a divorce the
most probably the most insane ultimatum
i've ever heard in my entire life that
being said i think i mean reading
between the lines on this post this is
like a hurt people hurt people sort of
thing right
this person obviously has experience
with this like as a child that created
some trauma and now that has become
something for them that is like a a
pressure point where if it happened to
them as an adult they would be like i'm
going to blow up my whole life because
of this so i i guess i understand
my husband's in his forties only
recently opened up about how it hurt
that his stepdad treated him differently
than his half br half brothers this
could cause a lifetime of pain this is
called parental differential treatment
there are studies about how harmful it
is please look this up and understand
you're the [ __ ] when you married your
wife you became that boy's that user
received gold for this post by the way
you became that boy's dad what you were
doing now is actively harming him so
allow me to play the devil's advocate
here
i think you could be
i understand the philosophy but i think
you could be a great
dad and stepdad and treat your step
child the exact same way
that you treat your other children
but just not get the tattoo on your body
like i don't think those are mutually
exclusive you know you don't have to get
a tattoo of your child's name biological
or otherwise to be like a good dad
the kid doesn't have to know that his
name's not tattooed on his stepdad okay
the dad could just wear long sleeve
shirts for like the next
i don't know like well not even that
long if he wears long sleeve shirts for
five years then his stepson will be 13
and then his stepson will be like
wow
it would be really cringe dad step dad
it's so cringe
that you got my name tattooed on you and
then you'd be like surprise
i didn't
get owned
we were playing the long con for a third
of your life i've been setting up this
own how does that feel
i don't know may i maybe i'm taking it
not seriously enough
but i just feel like you can just be
like a good
the problem is not that he's not getting
the tattoo the problem is that he's
gotten a tattoo with all of his other
children's names okay i do like i
understand that that's the way it's
perceived
but i think you could just be like a
great dad and also not get a tattoo
i don't know
it's not even about the kid yeah it's
more about like you know the
the family like
isn't there a stat on divorce that's
like okay 50 of marriages end in divorce
but like
that it's actually like
30
of people get divorced and then like
there's some people that get married and
divorced like eight times that blow up
the curve all i'm saying is this guy has
a
he has a predilection towards possibly
getting divorced again so i can
understand why he doesn't want to get
the tattoo
bad stats i don't know i feel like
most couples don't get divorced and then
some
like
a lot do but then the reason the divorce
rate is so high is because everyone
knows like
one of your uncles is a dentist who's
been married seven times you know
you're like really
like you met at a resort last month and
you're getting married again
this is the eighth new name this is this
is aunt linda number eight
and you expect me to buy you a toaster a
hamilton beach four-slice toaster at
your eighth wedding are you crazy
anyway
i don't know that's a prickly one that
was a good one to get started on
a lot of people disagree and you know
what i mean as long as you're
as long as we're all being reasonable
oh here we go
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to wear
quote-unquote protection at a family
gathering let me guess
let me guess what protection is in this
context
i'm going to guess that it's a
0.2 millimeter thick uh
cloth mask is my expectation maybe i
could be wrong i could be wrong
see update on my profile
my 18f family gets together every summer
in my grandparents cottage it's really
big house and can accommodate all slash
most of the family
this summer has been the first time
doing the get-together since kovid oh
but i thought you got together every
summer
all of it's all we're on sentence number
three and the whole thing's falling
apart already
your honor motion to dismiss
everyone has made a huge effort to come
as it's a very important tradition it's
my parents generation
with some as young as their early 30s
and then their kids one to eight and
finally me and my younger cousin in the
middle who i don't get along with as
she's a bit of a brat slash mean towards
me i usually don't mind playing
babysitter but this time i was asked to
too much and i'm afraid refusing might
cause permanent damage with my family i
can understand that you're 18 years old
you don't want to
i and i mean this sincerely you want to
look at your phone
for six hours and talk to your friends
you don't want to be babysitting a bunch
of one to eight-year-olds
all day well like the rest of your
family gets uh
hammered on like uh
white claws and you know hard topochico
and stuff like that
most of the children are at that age
where they're still potty training
or still wetting the bed this runs in my
family some of the older kids were
refusing to put on their nighttime
underwear because they were embarrassed
to do it with their cousins there not
all of them went to bed so my
grandmother decided to invite to avoid
any embarrassment for the children they
would all wear protection for a few days
so protection in this case is a diaper
like a nighttime diaper
and they would be able to stop wearing
it if they did not wet the bed this is
like a battle royale
last man standing
if you don't piss your pants you don't
have to wear the the diaper anymore
okay so we're at the part of the post
where it gets insane
um
this was all well until my cousin 15 who
sleeps with the kids because she's still
considered one was asked to wear the
protection too to set a good example for
the children i did not see anything
wrong with this okay
i'm gonna stop you right there
asking a 15 year old to wear a nighttime
diaper
to show solidarity with children who are
one to eight is is insane
this is legit a fetish scenario post
i don't know if something's wrong with
you or if something's wrong with the
internet
maybe i i want to believe that it's not
okay it's both
because i i do think there's a lot of
like false positives people will be like
i got my head on my dick hit with a
sledgehammer should i go to the hospital
people are like this is fake it's a
fetish post lots of people out there
love having the tip of their dick
smashed with a sledgehammer and i'm like
i don't think so
but i don't know this might be
this might not be a false positive i'm
going to continue reading it and we'll
pull the hit the eject button if it
turns into something
even more disgusting but
anyway
like this is just to where we're at in
the post yeah it's not good to force a
teenager to wear a diaper
to go to bed the thing with okay so one
to eight-year-old kids are like um oh i
don't want to wear the diaper unless our
cousin wears it okay sorry you're six so
you're gonna wear the diaper
i don't know what you want dude welcome
to real life like
when you're one to eight years old
you're not calling the shots if you were
calling the shots the world would be
even more [ __ ] up than it already is
sometimes you gotta do what you're told
yeah be mad okay cry it out who cares
anyway she did not like having to wear
the bed wedding diaper and thought she
was too old for that my grandmother
reminded her that i wet my bed until i
was 16 so she's not too old okay so now
because one of my other family members
wet the bed now i gotta wear a diaper
catching strays for no reason at all
she argued that if she who had not wet
the bed in over 10 in 10 years
she was not went to bed in over 10 years
had to wear the underwear
then so should i because i only stopped
bedwetting a couple of oh i'm out of
here man this just doesn't sound right
i'm not even suggesting it's a fetish
post it's just i don't know it just
doesn't sound right something's not
right
i'm glad that one weekend a year these
people are all hanging out together and
they're not in gen pop with the rest of
us i would love for you to tell me what
weekend that is so i feel more
comfortable going outside
i don't want to read anything else you
ever write for the rest of your entire
life
am i the [ __ ]
for pretending a movie trilogy is a tv
series to my girlfriend who hates movies
i don't even really understand this but
i'm it sounds so innocuous as to be
hilarious some
am i the [ __ ] are like i shot my
girlfriend in the leg
am i the [ __ ] and some of them are
like i
uh forgot to use my signal light once am
i the [ __ ] both could be make you the
[ __ ] but i i have a penchant for both
of them quite frankly
i like the innocuous ones like the one
where they uh they eat each other's
shredded cheese and they're like about
to break up over it i love those
so my girlfriend hates movies for some
reason but really loves to binge tv
shows like crazy she's a big fan of
sci-fi and even time travel holy cow
even time travel she's an advanced
sci-fi viewer
like doctor who for example big fan
however apparently she's never heard of
back to the future i mean this is like
the most
this is more fake than the last post
you've never never seen is one thing but
you've never heard of back to the future
your girlfriend is
older than
you know 18 years old presumably i just
i don't know
i'd be surprised
advanced sci-fi viewer never heard it
back to the future she loves time travel
by the way never heard of back i mean
it's possible but
i tried to watch looper with her but she
immediately dismissed it because it's a
movie
so since i'm a bit
it's just a very funny sentence so since
i'm a big fan of back to the future i
told her it's a tv series
i've got the trilogy digitally and spent
all night trimming it down to like 40
minute snippets with as reasonable
points to cut at like just after the
first travel back
holy cow that's so funny you think he
edited like the netflix
sting into the front of it like
that's actually amazing
i overlay to be continued and added
credits at the end she's used to netflix
skipping the intro to shows so i didn't
have to bother with that the credits
were cut short as well
we binge the entire thing in a day well
it's like it's two hours long
i gotta know dude like is this guy he's
got like a super computer in his house
or something too this seems like it
it seems like he was doing a lot of
rendering they watch all three movies
it okay that's crazy
we binged the entire thing in a day she
absolutely loved it although she
complained about some of the episode
endings because they felt off yeah i
wonder why afterwards i told her why it
felt off because it's actually three
movies and not a tv show but i'm glad
she liked it regardless she wasn't
having it after calling me a liar and
[ __ ] for betraying her like that she
stormed off to go home instead of
staying the night as was planned i mean
yeah i did lie to her but personally i
don't see it as that bad so am i the
[ __ ]
we talked over lunch break over lunch
break
what the hell
over a lunch break
how old are you
or do you are you co-workers
maybe they're co-workers
we talked over lunch break and
everything's fine i apologize to her
again for tricking her and said i didn't
mean to upset her i just wanted to share
this movie i love with her as some
comments said she felt belittled and
like i made fun of her she apologized
for overreacting as she realized it came
from a place of care and good intentions
even if they were selfish she wants more
communication in the future though she
didn't lose trust in me and she doesn't
think i'm having malicious intent with
her either we're gonna watch looper
tonight bad chest
bad chest
looper mom says we can watch looper
tonight i do i have to um how it's so
funny
how overblown the conversation to
reconcile was versus the actual offense
in the first place
she wants more communication in the
future though
bro you just
you edited back to the future into a tv
show you put a little splice in every 40
minutes and then told her it was a tv
show
it's not like uh
you don't have to blow up the whole
relationship
for that this is this is just funny it's
just a funny post
assuming it's real
i i don't even have like i don't have
anything else to say the thing that's
really funny is that
it's such a minor thing
to blow up into a real fight is
hilarious
he spliced looper in the
youtube shorts yeah dude if he wants
what he should actually do oh my
girlfriend uh she doesn't like tv shows
or movies because she only watches tik
tok well i really like the irishman so i
edited it down
to
uh 543
30 second chunks and edit it into
portrait style like it was taken from a
cell phone
and then i showed them all to her in a
playlist called um amazing
tick tock saga about old mobsters
hashtag lol anyway
maybe we lost our way
on the bit there a little bit that's
very funny though i like that
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting my
female best friend to move out once i
get married
this one has no verdict by the way no
never mind it's 65 you're the [ __ ]
[Laughter]
uh
it says not enough info but then the the
comments tell the real story
i love that you won't believe what brad
pitt found inside of the box think david
fincher is only known for the ultimate
girl boss movie gone girl you're wrong
75 years ago in 1995 he made a thriller
based on the bible called seven
at the end of the movie there's a
classic scene you may have seen meme
reaction images of a young brad pitt in
his first starring role saying what's in
the box turned out it was pepper potts's
head
thanks for tuning in i'll see you with
more movie spoilers tomorrow
don't bad chess seven seven's a good
movie
kevin spacey's in it but he plays he
plays a bad guy so it's okay because he
is a bad guy
if kevin spacey was playing a hero i
would be like this movie's [ __ ] up to
watch but kevin spacey is playing a
psychopath i'm like holy [ __ ]
he wasn't acting
am i the [ __ ] for not wanting my
female best friend to move out once i
get married i know this sounds a little
weird but i'm in such a strange position
right now and i genuinely have no idea
what to do
so me 32 male i unique i'm 33 so i got a
little extra wisdom but i can put myself
in your shoes and my best friend sam 32f
have been living together for five years
now originally it was supposed to be a
temporary situation because because of
some health issues she was having we we
decided she was permanently going to
move in with me when we found out her
health wasn't gonna get better okay now
is the inevitably is the part where now
i'm an [ __ ] because i thought it was
just gonna be uh we just like each
other's company but she's schizophrenic
and blind along with having a various
other medical issues so a lot of daily
tasks are difficult for her our
arrangement is
i cook clean and drive and do other
things while she pays for all of our
shared living expenses
he was right he's in a strange position
he does kind of have this is really like
a
he's kind of like a caretaker there i
mean they can still be friends but like
but he has like a job
this honestly has been a dream situation
for us
it allows me to do my dream job for
which pay is so you have a job and a job
you're two you're a two job andy
i don't know i got to keep reading i'm
getting sidetracked too easily
it allows me to do my dream job well she
lives a pretty normal independent life
and gets support with her house house
issue health issues plus she never asked
to do housework
plus two i met my girlfriend three years
ago sam and emma were never super close
but they were always friendly and emma
was super understanding of our living
situation and never mentioned having a
problem with it to me recently we
started talking about getting married
and moving in together while we were
discussing it i mentioned i didn't know
what would happen to sam once we got
married emma got kind of irritated and
said sam would just move out and get her
own place finally i reminded her it
wasn't that simple but we started
fighting and i asked to change the
subject it came up again when emma said
something about moving into my apartment
well i gotta scroll here
and i told her we couldn't because it
was sam's apartment not mine and i'd
never be able to afford the rent
okay
we started fighting again i said sam
could never live by herself and i wasn't
sure i could get married if it meant i
had to leave her alone
emma said she needed space to think and
drove away a couple hours later she
texts me and basically says i can keep
having an emotional affair with sam
affair with sam if i want but she won't
put up with it anymore she doesn't want
to talk to me for a week and then after
that we can talk about if we want to be
together
i'm seriously so lost and conflicted
emma never expressed these opinions
before
i want to be with emma and live with her
but i can't just kick sam out on the
side of the road either i'd absolutely
be willing to live sam if she found
another arrangement that worked for her
but i might be the [ __ ] for not being
willing to leave sam without a new
caretaker to marry emma
hey
buddy you are you are [ __ ]
your life is a damn
like powder keg right now i don't even
is there like a
uh uh like you have my sympathy
yhms why hms
i mean
i definitely think
it's not unreasonable for a person to
assume that once they got married they
would live together
um
like alone together alone you know what
i mean uh
that seems pretty pretty normal
kind of a normie take
assuming this post is real which we
gotta do to begin with i can also
understand being like you know hey i
can't just
leave my friend who is dependent on me
um
at the same i don't know like without
being
too much of an [ __ ] myself i guess
what did you think was gonna happen
like were you gonna
you're gonna keep this arrangement up
for like the next 50 years until one of
you dies
at some point you gotta like you know
i mean with again this is like a little
maybe forehead
at some point sam has to
be in charge of her own
caretaking right like or or
like i don't think you could reasonably
just be like oh my long term plan
is to just keep paying all of the living
expenses for this guy
and he'll be the caretaker for me that
doesn't seem like a stable long-term
plan
maybe he could marry both
i'm not saying get over you know your
blindness
i'm just saying at some point it's like
i mean like this guy is not like
he's not a caretaker maybe maybe i'm
oversimplifying
but i feel like he's just like a guy
he's not like a
you know like a a professional
nurse or uh
you know somebody who's equipped to
handle
these issues i i think he's just like a
friend
it seems like he this is a situation
that has a long-term chance for like
disequilibrium to begin with
is he the is he the [ __ ] i don't know
i don't think he's an [ __ ]
necessarily
i think he's being an [ __ ] to his uh
fiance a little bit by assuming that
nothing about their situation would ever
have to change
and they would just get married and live
as normal but i think he's being very
nice and concerned with the well-being
of his friend
so i don't know does that cancel out
or does it is he both is he existing in
like a quantum superposition of like
being the [ __ ] and being the not the
[ __ ] at the same time
read the edit okay you guys are right
it's dumb for me to try to hide this
from sam she'd probably want to know
what's going on lastly okay my pay isn't
great including my savings and emma's
job too we could get married and be
fined financially without sam's money
emma knew our financial arrangement this
whole time it's no surprise there lastly
i made it clear that while i'm hesitant
to leave sam it's not because i like the
money and the lifestyle she provides
this is 100
100
about what's best for sam
me and sam will talk about it in a few
hours and i'll update then
so that was a damn lie this post was 23
days ago
no update emma definitely killed him we
need to get the true crime community on
this one right now we need where is
user slash dangerous ad 5075
we need to find this information
i don't know this post this i don't know
i feel like this is
i i'm going to start doing this anytime
a post has a
controversy associated with it i'm just
gonna say that it feels fake anyway so i
don't need the way in i don't need the
weigh-in i don't know that's honestly
just reading this post and this is a
very selfish thing for me to say
reading this post made me exhausted it
sounds like your life is very exhausting
right now and i [ __ ] feel for you
because that's a horrible situation
i'm not even saying it's your fault
you're in the situation i'm just saying
like
you know it sounds like every day is a
damn minefield so i wish you the best
and i hope you get through it
what is you have what is yhms that's you
have my sympathy am i the [ __ ] for
getting upset at my sister after she
upstaged my bad news with good news
is this like how i keep saying i almost
died and then people are like hey
i had my job interview called me back i
got the job thanks nl and i'm like i
almost died
how dare you have good news when i
almost died
am i the [ __ ] for getting upset at my
sister after she upstaged my bad news
with her good news so to start off i'm
f21 my sister sabrina i noticed you did
not hesitate to
drop your sister's name immediately and
maintain your own anonymity
it's not that big of a deal you might
have made it up to begin with but
you didn't even give yourself a
pseudonym
we're not particularly close but we
always got along i was always closer to
my brothers rare semi-colon spotted in
the wild you are the [ __ ] she was
closer to our parents
however sabrina lives very close to my
college so we've hung out a bit more in
the past few months sabrina has a 10
year old son isaac from a previous
relationship he left after she told him
she was pregnant okay isaac is autistic
and non-verbal but a sweet kid a few
days ago it was his 10th birthday and my
sister
basically invited our whole family to
come myself included she is extremely
proud of isaac and documents describes
to us his every move everything is
another first
a few weeks before the party isaac said
his first word obviously my sister
documented and told everyone we were all
very excited he has said a couple more
leading up to the party even saying my
name when i was out to dinner with him
and his mother i was thrilled
okay and then this is the turn
i was thrilled
but
a few weeks ago as well i found that i
was pregnant with my long oh my god no
no no no i can't reason it's fake
fake post
get me out of here man
what happened am i the [ __ ]
it used to be like am i the [ __ ] for
eating all the fully loaded nachos now
every single one is like me
um i got hit with a
syphilitic cannonball back in the 1700s
and my
chest cavities caved in on itself
my girlfriend
uh
has been possessed by the ghost of an
angry demon
and we're trying to decide what
restaurant to go to like it's just
what happened to the now every single
one is like hey um
uh just so you know
um my sister has a lot of problems and i
told her to shut up by the way i also
have a lot of problems
what is
what happened to just
the we need to go back to the shredded
cheese pose you know what it is man i'm
not i'm not going to any more posts
where the username is like
adjective underscore verb
underscore four-digit number
you you [ __ ] liars you creative
writing andies
i'm not going to any more default
usernames look how about this one
rioting that's a real human being that
made this post okay
i can at least get i don't know if this
is going to be real but i can at least
look at it
am i the [ __ ] for confronting my
brother for pointing out my boyfriend
isn't actually my husband okay let's see
let's see it is a i expect people to
make throwaways okay i'm just saying not
default reddit username throwaways
this is not adjective verb thankfully
so i've been with my boyfriend for over
13 years but boyfriend sounds really
high school after everything we've been
through so i call him my husband and ask
that my family does too
as a married person i give you my
permission to do that because
who cares who gives a [ __ ] at all
i'm honestly just not that interested in
your life if you want to call your your
boyfriend of 13 years your husband
i honestly don't care
oh you didn't go through a day where you
stand in front of a bunch of people and
[ __ ] repeat after some guy at the
front nobody cares okay i mean some
people probably care also and this is an
aside
but like
i don't know how it is in in the rest of
the world but in canada common law is is
[ __ ] crazy
like
if you live with someone for like two
years you're legally married i think i
was legally married to like six people
simultaneously in college
just because i had roommates that that i
you know moved around with
i i think technically
oh you have to file for it i don't think
so because i i thought i i mean this is
like in 2004 or something like that when
i learned about it in like high school
but
like if i we were basically told like if
you live with
somebody
for two years
they can basically
hit you with like a divorce settlement
they could i mean i'm not saying that
like if you lived with your friend as a
roommate your roommate could like fake
divorce you but i think if you lived
with like a
a you know a partner a romantic partner
and then
you broke up
i think that your partner could go to a
lawyer and be like
we were common-law married because you
get common-law married by default in
canada like it just happens after two
years or three years
and you're entitled to some kind of uh
like benefits as a result at least in
ontario
it's one year in ontario that's crazy
oh three years one if you have a kid
together
no i didn't sleep with my
roommates they're all engineers
yuck
anyway
um
okay
so i'm i'm okay with with her saying
they're married for the record
as somebody who's who's married
i don't it's not like a we're not a
protected class
husbands and wives go ahead i i honestly
if you've been with someone for 13 years
you're [ __ ] married as far as i'm
concerned
like you're it's not like your
relationship is any less
legitimate than somebody who met their
spouse six months ago and then got
married in las vegas or something like
that who cares
all right so yesterday we had an early
fall i mean like i feel like sorry for
getting uh
stun locked over and over by myself but
like the only reason i feel like you
would get married after 13 years of
being in a relationship together is so
that you didn't have to have the
conversation every time you met new
people
you would just be like oh we should just
[ __ ] like
spend 35 grand on a wedding just so we
never have to be like well we just don't
believe in the institution so much you
know like at that point you would just
do it to to never have to have the the
talk again but anyway
so yesterday we had an early father's
day get-together at my mom's house and i
brought a father's day gift for each my
step-dad and my two brothers when we
were doing the gifts one of my brothers
casually handed my husband a gift and
everyone stopped their own convos
started paying attention to them my
husband looked confused because we don't
have any kids my brother says in front
of everyone every dude come on
my brother says in front of everyone i
know y'all miscarried so maybe you're
not celebrating it but i know how
excited you were and i think you would
have been awesome at it you might be an
illegitimate brother-in-law but you
would have made a great dad
there's abs this never happened
there is nobody on earth that would do
this
that would give you
a gift
for father's day after you went through
this traumatic experience and then while
giving you the gift was also like oh by
the way you're not really married to my
sister is this is idiotic man what
happened to this subreddit these are
these are the filtered posts this is an
embarrassment
am i that what is am i the [ __ ] for
not saving my girlfriend's son when he
was pinned under a bench press
what the hell
season season two
breaking bad all you have to do is lift
the damn bar man jesse
i don't care if this one's fake at least
there's probably not like a traumatic uh
experience in this
i hope
this is probably just physical injury



i'm a 36 year old man and my girlfriend
is 34. i'll call her jenny
she has a son who is 14 from a previous
relationship i'll call him george
jenny and i get along well in basically
all but one department george as bad as
this is going to make me sound i really
don't like this kid but jenny's rose
tinted glasses for him might as well be
painted with a coat of black at this
point
i don't know this kind of like mixed
metaphors at this point
you i don't think you can have rose
tinted glasses that are also painted
black
it doesn't make any sense she
legitimately can't stop enabling his bad
behavior let alone recognize it for what
it is the friction has only gotten worse
as she moved in with me two months ago
because they could no longer afford to
live alone i have a basement gym
i have poured over seven thousand
dollars into and this is where i'm
adding some
creative license
after
my divorce with my first wife
it has multiple types of high-end
barbells a power rack and various other
equipment in past days i was a
competitive power lifter and although
i've scaled back a lot on that front i
still trained very hard
when jenny and george moved in
george started to use my home gym
uninvited i first warned him not to
hey
without being too
judgmental right now
why not just help him you could have a
shared interest
with your stepson you could have a hobby
together he could channel what you seem
to think are you know
malevolent urges into something a little
bit more productive
but okay because you spent the money on
it you're not gonna let it's literally
just it's just iron bars going up and
down
like it's not that serious man
you're not gonna let your stepson use
your home gym like it's it just seems
insane to me
he's only 14.
you just like you teach him how to do it
right you could work you could lift
weights when you're 14.
you ever see kid tarzan
he's like a seven-year-old kid who had
like a 10 pack he was on tlc all the
time
15 years ago
just yeah like
just teach him how to work out safely
and then
it's there's nothing wrong with that
anyway
he lied through his teeth and has
consistently done it behind my back done
what oh worked out wow this kid he's
crazy i can tell because he leaves
barbells loaded and equipment moved okay
i mean that's again
without being an [ __ ] that's why you
should like work out with him that's bad
gym etiquette is to leave the barbell
loaded in like plates all strewn about
but people do that like in their 40s if
you've ever used a an actual gym
um
but you should supervise the kid and be
like hey put your barbell back you got
to you could you got to be a dad sorry
you're 37 years old
i then put a lock on the door very
mature which george broke down with a
hammer i then reinforced the door and
put a new lock on which george could not
penetrate
what the hell is going on man
you reinforce the door
jenny insists on having a spare key to
the basement and i recently learned
she's been loaning it to george she
tried cleaning up after him but i could
tell since he and she are home during
the day as he takes lessons online c
plays minecraft with the teacher muted i
can do nothing about it jenny won't
return my key either
a couple of days ago i got home from
work and decided to hit the gym noticing
the door open i walked down the stairs
only to find george in the middle of a
bench press set as i watched from the
stairs he went for one rep too many and
got pinned he was in no danger at any
point
because the barbell was low on his
sternum plus it was only like 80 pounds
after 30 seconds of panic mode he
finally got the bright idea to dump the
weight to which i gave him a slow clap
30s you let this kid
flounder for 30 seconds thinking he was
gonna like
crush his rib cage i know it's only 80
pounds but like
if this this post has to be fake
because otherwise this guy should be
minority reported he should be in prison
i don't know if it's a crime to let your
teenage stepson think that he's gonna
die from a bench press gone wrong but
like this guy
seems like i mean i'm just gonna say it
it seems like he drives a dodge ram
doesn't use his signal light and then
tries to
uh
antagonize people on the road so that he
can get into a road rage incident and
and have an opportunity to to kill you
he seems like an insane person
they're coming to take him away right
now i don't know if you can hear the
sirens
i started to tell him that's what
happens when you work out alone okay
we're we're almost on like this we're
parallel lines destined to never meet
why don't you just work out together man
it's crazy
he then shrieked at me red-faced
probably because he um
it literally was in like mortal fear and
and scared
um then he insulted my strength to which
i responded i'm not the one getting
pinned under an 80-pound bench he ran
upstairs basically in tears and told
jenny what i had said jenny's also
furious with me and they're both giving
me the silent treatment she says i
should have handled the situation better
but i say i kind of did when i installed
the heavy duty door and put a new lock
on it i'm gonna be changing the lock
tomorrow
least insane
divorced stepdad redditer
it
if this post is fake and there's a
chance that it is because it's on am i
the [ __ ] i commend the creative
writing because it's not so heavy-handed
as to be like immediately dismissible as
fake because i think we all know
somebody in our lives
that are you know like their masculinity
is so fragile that they're like no i
would never let my stepson work out in
my gym i paid for it
why should he be able to work out why
should a child that's part of my family
be able to share some of my property
when i'm the one who had to
scan my amex to get it like there's
people there's people like that
it's so obvious that like if this is
real all you have to do is start working
out with your stepson and then you like
it's like a movie you build like an
awesome bond with one another
your kid becomes young hercules he gets
his own tlc
you know special
he gets a million followers on instagram
you know it's like a path to to success
but instead what do you do it's like
rainbow six siege you're putting up like
a damn castle wall
he's using a sledgehammer to break it
down and then you got like a a frost
bear trap
just underneath it the cat i mean and
also like it's unconscionable to to
watch your stepson
even if he's not in physical risk like
of of injury to watch your stepson like
think that he's like just be scared and
panicked for 30 seconds and not help
like you should help a stranger in that
situation obviously not helping your own
stepson is truly madness
like that's i i mean again if this is
real i don't want to diagnose you but
because i'm not a psychiatrist uh i
can't be disbarred for doing so seems a
little like you might be like a
sociopath or something i don't know you
seem to only
uh consider how things affect you which
is particularly insane because you're 36
years old and this is literally just the
child
anyway i wanna i wanna take a look at
some of the comments to feel like
potentially validated on this
okay if you don't like her son i would
end the relationship to be honest
fairly reasonable take
but also maybe like
make an effort would also that would
probably be like my first thing is maybe
like make an effort
not the [ __ ]
no sorry i got stun like for a second
when i saw the guy because i'm like
they mean that you're the [ __ ] right
like i i just can't believe that the
second post that was awarded reddit
comet for this
i i actually did not
i it didn't hit the part of my brain
that allowed me to interpret it not the
[ __ ] i think you're the one viewing
things through rose tinted glasses it's
not just a matter of enabling him your
girlfriend is using you
she's refusing to give you the spare key
to your gym for the sole purpose of
using it to violate your wish to not
have your kid that kid in there sorry i
said your kid that's my mistake that kid
this is beyond disrespectful and now you
have to change the lock again you have
you have no choice but to change the
lock one more time because she will not
relinquish the key even better she's
punishing you with the silent treatment
question
what happens when she demands the new
key for the new lock you'll get will she
keep giving you the silent treatment
until you yield
this relationship isn't healthy edit
thanks for the awards and stuff kind
strangers holy cow
this is like and somebody said this in
the in the discord
yesterday and it it's completely true or
at least matches my preconceived notions
of am i the [ __ ] there is a a group
of people out there i don't even know
they might even be 51 plus of the
population that basically thinks
uh you have complete control over
everything in your own house at all
times and not only do you have control
but you should exercise that control at
all times
i can't imagine putting yourself in a
position
where
you forbid
your
14 year old stepson from using your home
gym it just why would you
like if at any point he said something
like i'm worried he's gonna get injured
then i would be like okay
that makes sense maybe like try i'm not
saying the kid is not gonna like go
around him but like maybe like hey only
work out when you're like with me
uh like supervised you know we're gonna
teach you safety rules and stuff like if
he ever said like it's dangerous that's
fine but he didn't
he's
it instead he mentioned the price tag
for how much the gym cost him which i
think you can read between the lines and
figure out why he doesn't want someone
else to use it you know he spent seven
thousand dollars not only to have his
own home gym but also because um it
allows him to exclude other people from
it even though this seems like a
no-brainer opportunity to like bond with
your child and or your your stepson
anyway
i came just the idea look
the idea that like
well if your your girlfriend was unable
to pay for her own living expenses and
now she has the audacity to defy your
orders in your own house this is
and then she's when she's mad at you for
potentially having letting her son think
that he's in mortal danger
she has the audacity to give you the
silent treatment in your own house like
what
it's a scary thought man that that this
has 8 000 upvotes just my personal take
the narwhal do be baconing at midnight
though for sure
i came here to say this her absolute
lack of respect for you and your
property shows how little she thinks of
your relationship
i i i'm not saying you can't break gym
equipment
but so much of it is literally like iron
bars
and solid
like metal plates
what's he gonna do
like this guy's power lifting he's got
barbells he's got plates
he has a squat rack
you know
it's not like he's a bowflex he's gonna
get the the
iron
peacock feathers like tangled or
something i just don't understand
they're so concerned about
the the
you might drop a plate on the ground or
something like that
what are you talking about i'm just like
i'm not i nobody's concerned about the
child hurting himself he was literally
trapped under the bar everybody's
concerned about the damage that he might
do to the seven thousand dollar home gym
that consists exclusively of like iron
circles it's crazy man
there's nothing here to salvage i think
you need to kick her out and find a new
person to date because there's no
repairing the lack of disregard for you
holy cow
this is
this is madness
here we go
also
why do people not talk and find
compromises like okay kid you really
want to use the gym you can do it two
times a week or however often with me no
sneaking no safety issues it could even
be bonding issues with the kid but no
one side entirely locks down a room
instead of finding a way to find safe
use and the other side violently
disrespects that just fully
dysfunctional the whole thing okay a
normal person that exists in the real
world
384 upvotes
how dare your girlfriend give you the
silent treatment 7.8 000 upvotes and
they gave it a someone spent real
american dollars to give it a shooting
star that shows up when you scroll past
it
like i don't know why so many uh
relationships in am i the [ __ ] end up
being like nobody's gonna ever like if
you relinquish control over even the
smallest issue of all time you lose
like
at one point don't you just
realize like this [ __ ] isn't [ __ ]
worth it and be like okay
sorry
let's move on like let's let's get back
to our lives that like the important
parts instead of getting sidetracked by
like a a stupid like pride prideful
argument for like a month
it's this is there's no way to live man
i know the most normal redditors of all
time hey why wouldn't you just bond with
him hey why he's a 14 year old boy who
wants to work out you clearly like
working out why wouldn't you just bond
with him jenny's the worst the worst
jennies are always the worst so true
most sane redditor in the comments
spotted
what the hell are you even talking about
not the [ __ ] and it's a good idea for
george and jenny to move out as soon as
they can she is enabling his bad
behavior and showing zero respect for
you whatever you do don't marry this
woman unless you want to deal with
george for the rest of your life your
your girlfriend doesn't respect you
she has zero respect for you and enables
his bad behavior what's his bad behavior
again physically exercising no nl that's
not right
that's not right the disrespect is that
she didn't do exactly what you said
which as we all know is the basis for a
healthy relationship
all healthy relationships are
essentially just
sequences of
demand comply demand comply
do this i did it do this i did it blah
blah blah nobody ever exercises their
own autonomy at all especially not
teenagers but hey hey but nl have you
considered it's his house
have you considered it's his house his
rules
1.4 000 likes take her key away and kick
them out jesus no amount of sex is worth
this hassle
this this is the most insane thing i've
ever seen in my entire life it has 1.4
000 likes
are you actually like 15 years
old what a hassle that you know what
very good point what hassle
uh i had to make fun of my 14 year old
stepson after he almost died doing an
irresponsible bench press because i
refused to teach him gym safety
it's such a hassle man after like a long
day of work to have to spend time with
my family no amount of sex is worth the
hassle
friend of mine used to say they must be
a tornado between the sheets when we
heard this sort of story let me guess
your friend eventually grew up and was
not 21 years old anymore but you somehow
have just stayed locked into this
mindset for the rest of your life what
the hell are you talking about
over in under a minute and only leaving
destruction behind
is this the immortal bard william
shakespeare
to quote a very old joke it starts with
a lot of sucking and blowing and ends
with you losing your house oh
dude
truer things have never been said
whole cow
dude women are getting lit up in the
comments section holy cow
jeez jenny dude do not let jenny see
this she would be like
she'd be like
oh man
holy cow
she would be like monka giga featuring
robert downey jr
okay this is i would say this is
reasonably fair
i'm sorry i put a lock on the door which
george broke down with a hammer in a
home they only live in because they
couldn't afford to live alone with a
hammer okay that is pretty
that is pretty funny
assuming this is real i have to put that
in there because it probably isn't
oh man
i just don't get it man
every post is like not the [ __ ]
do i just live in a different world
where like i ex i
express my desires to other people and
don't expect them to just blindly comply
with whatever i want at all times
i accept that when i
express a desire i'm expressing it to
another autonomous person who may have a
conflicting desire or just a different
priority order of things that they want
to do like in their own lives
everybody else appears to be like well
what i say is the law
how's that working out for you
you got five thousand upvotes on redis
so maybe you're not complaining but
this is this is reddit craziness i'm i'm
kind of
i'm kind of losing it a little bit
now the little [ __ ] deserved it i mean
okay he did break the lock with a hammer
that's a little shitty but like
i'm just i'm it's so crazy to me that
you could see
your stepson
wriggling under a bench press
and he's literally 14 years old like
he's in the ninth grade and you watch it
with like shad and freud you're like ah
don't worry though he instantly analyzed
the amount of weight on the bar and also
he knows like the strength of uh of a
ninth grader's sternum
he's like i have at least 52 seconds
before this becomes a serious deal
he did an ocular pat-down
not the [ __ ] are you sure you want
the liability of these two in your home
honestly not much right now
jenny has been good to me generally
but she's a terrible mother for george
plus as you say a gigantic financial
risk for me
holy cow this is the funniest thing i've
ever read
you just called your girlfriend a
terrible mother
and a gigantic financial risk i mean
he's not saying like the gym is gonna
break and then he's gonna owe seven
thousand dollars to rebuild it he's
saying like if the stepson dies
in the gym
then he's gonna get sued
but like
that's why you should show him how to
work out safely man
you're the one who let him wriggle under
the bar you [ __ ]
what are you talking about
if he got hurt
he could jenny could take me to the
cleaners by the way am i the [ __ ] for
letting him think that he was gonna have
his thoracic cavity [ __ ] cave in for
30 seconds just to teach him a lesson
he's so like
like
self-pitying she generally just is this
way with anything with regards to george
i wonder why maybe because it was her
son and he was he's because he shouldn't
have broken the lock but he broke the
lock to work out man
it's not he's not he didn't steal your
car and go on a joy ride he's just he's
doing a bench press
i thought it was something she may get
better with
but i'm gradually losing hope as time
goes on that must be hard for you uh to
balance that
along with your uh alter ego living as
the punisher
that's a lot to put on one man's plate i
got a lot of sympathy for that
anyway i think that's i'm like i'm upset
with this post but i'm also feeling
powerful as a result of how upset i am
so it it feels good to be honest
how about it oh my oh dude i can't even
so
sorry to be millennial there with my i
can't even but i i can't
even resist i added another word i can't
even resist this one am i the [ __ ]
for refusing to pay my babysitter it's
the intersection of all of my current
interests being mad at people in our
slash [ __ ] mom groups say
okay am i the [ __ ] for refusing to
pay my babysitter
i 32f of my husband 30 male
i'm inclined to think she's not the
[ __ ] because this is the rare reddit
post where the wife is older than the
husband
she's girl bossing honest i'm happy for
her i'm proud of her
i think she's doing great work keep it
up i don't even need to read the rest
just kidding
um we plan to go on a date to see a
movie at a theater near us since the
movie was two hours long and it's 30
minutes to go there and 30 minutes to go
back the movie was starting at six and
the kids go to bed at seven or eight we
hired a babysitter for three hours
totally reasonable
i understand
i posted an ad on a facebook group for
babysitters and a girl who i'll just
called call b message me saying she
would take the job i have two kids caleb
and todd
six male and four male hopefully not six
months and four months otherwise like
jeez who the heck is her uh
her obstetrician
she's a damn miracle worker i agreed to
pay the amount she requested
which inclu which was about 25 per hour
per kid okay
i mean that's
i would honestly that seems like a
competitive wage to me
so it's 150 bucks for three hours of
babysitting see that seems
if if i may say so that seems more than
reasonable
maybe not much more but but but
reasonable for sure
when bee got there i gave her a list of
things i wanted her to do which included
keep them entertained i'm fine with them
just watching tv for a bit but not over
30 minutes can i tell you something
this is this is a nice to have not a
need to have i know how this sounds but
i don't think you should hire a
babysitter and expect them to be a
parent
sorry
maybe when you're when you're at the
movies
you don't know what's going on in your
house i think the only reasonable
expectation i think you can have of a
babysitter is that they're gonna
supervise your children and keep them
safe and they're going to eat maybe if
they haven't eaten yet and they're going
to go to bed at they're going to try to
go to bed at the right time the idea
that
you could you're basically
trying to get someone that you found on
facebook to also uphold all of your like
parenting standards for that three-hour
period seems a little unreasonable to me
but maybe other people would disagree
feed the kids okay
we have a play set outside and toys in
their room great news sandwiches are
fine they can have something sweet after
dinner before they brush their teeth
make sure they brush their teeth put
them to bed make sure you give them a
bit of time after they eat to use the
bathroom get caleb to bed around eight
and todd the bed around seven this kid's
going to bed at 7 p.m
my baby goes to bed at like 8 30. this
is
i mean i would love it if she went to
bed at seven but holy cow i'm at this
i'm not mad i'm actually jealous
kids going to bed at seven
holy cow man
my six-year-old goes to bed at 7 30.
does that invert like at some point
well i guess it's a flip side right
because right now my daughter wakes up
at like 8 a.m
but when she starts going to bed at like
7 she's gonna wake up at 5.
once the naps go away it starts to
invert okay that's honest i don't know
if i'm looking forward to i guess it's
just life anyway that's fine
and so my husband and i left and drove
off when returning i walked into the
house and my boys were playing on the
couch kids should have been asleep for
at least an hour or two by now this
already made me a bit angry hey i got we
got to hear why they're not
why they're not in bed okay
this already made me a bit angry since i
had put the times on the list of things
i needed from b
the kids had food stains all over their
mouth and hands and there were candy
wrappers and paper plates on the floor
in the couch they also had half their
toys on the floor and b wasn't watching
them i asked my husband to put the kids
to bed and i'd find and talk to bee i
went into my kitchen she had her phone
in her hand and was sitting at my dining
table when she noticed
me she looked up and asked if i needed a
minute to go get her money sorry one
second i'm getting lost in the paragraph
here or if i already had it on me
i told her she would not be getting paid
if she did not do any work and did not
take care of my children she yelled at
me that we agreed on me paying her and
that she tried to take care of my kids
but they weren't listening i yelled at
her to get out of my house and she left
without getting paid my kids aren't
perfectly behaved
and i can definitely imagine them giving
b a hard time i also feel bad now that
i've gotten some talking to's from other
moms and i don't think that any of the
babysitters will accept my sitting
requests now so read it am i the [ __ ]
okay
i was straight up hit you within
everybody sucks here
and i would also hit you with
maybe a suggestion that this is why you
don't hire a stranger from facebook to
babysit your children
the correct course of outcome or the
correct course of action i should say
is that
you had a nice date night
you pay her the 150 bucks and then you
never hire her again
and you tell everybody you know
that she was not a good babysitter you
undermine her business
in a sinister fashion from the outside
rather than just hit her with like one
data point that's gonna cause her a
little bit of pain
you dig out the foundation of her her
business from the outside that's taking
the high road okay write that down
at the end of the day i mean
i've
you got three hours of babysitting
the babysitting just [ __ ] sucked
like it sounds like she's a really bad
babysitter
you pay the 150 bucks
i mean like
you're not i without being unreasonable
you're not god this isn't like a home
renovation
this isn't like a a lawyer what are you
gonna you're really gonna be like oh
well actually the correct course of
action was to dock her pay by 50 bucks
what do you
like
just pay her what you said you were
gonna pay her and then never pay her
never hire her again
you're really gonna waste your time
being like well you only gave me 75
dollars worth of babysitting
to me that doesn't make any sense
i definitely still feel like she's the
[ __ ]
i i
like she's the [ __ ] but also the
babysitter is really bad she's not a
good babysitter
i do legal work and i charge less per
hour than the babysitter
you do legal work you charge less than
25 dollars per hour
fifty dollars well it's two kids
you charge twenty five dollars per hour
per client
per per uh
signee on the class actually lost
sorry i'm just you've you've said the
statement that now has me asking more
questions you know
i'm just scared like
i don't know like not to be rude but i
think if i had the lawyer and he was
like i worked on this file for four
hours you owe me a hundred bucks i would
be like
i think i'm gonna seek new
representation how can you keep the
lights on that's like half a workday man
you we were you have an office in a big
glass building
it's just it just doesn't seem like this
is sustainable
anyway um i mean i don't know how much
more there is to mine here
i definitely think they're like both
[ __ ]
i mean i i think it's like an open and
dry case
for me you pay the price that you you
quoted them
and then you're unhappy with the service
and you never use them again
am i the [ __ ] for asking my wife to
use our last name on her doctorate i'm
not look the edit so many of the edits
people are like read the edit read the
edit the edit like never changes
anything they it's the op getting stun
locked because people are like i don't
know if you're the [ __ ] but 150 for
babysitting is too much and then they go
i know i quoted them a high rate but in
my area there's a high cost of living
like it's stuff that that makes no
difference whatsoever to the original
post most of the time
am i the [ __ ] for throwing my
mcdonald's bag back inside the
drive-through window post has been
deleted
am i the [ __ ] for throwing my phone
my wife's phone out the window because
she wouldn't stop texting her friend
when we're at the cottage oh man
this [ __ ] always gets me man this is
oh come on
and then i'm not even gonna put it up on
the screen because it's like at first
you're like you should never throw your
wife's phone and then here we go she
couldn't stop messaging her writing
friend all they talk about are
characters and role-playing them with
each other my wife is looking for a
serious career in writing but this is
literally just for fun she's never gonna
publish this dark academia borderline
fan fiction okay [ __ ] stop making
stuff up
[ __ ]
get like a real hobby
it's madness
am i the [ __ ] for expecting this one
seems real even though it has a
throwaway account name with four numbers
at the end of it
am i the [ __ ] for expecting my
boyfriend to help fix the house we live
in
i don't think it's real
i'm looking at it and i'm saying i don't
think it's real
i'm sorry to t i'm
i'm i i don't know if this is the end of
react court or what but so many of these
posts are just
they're just bait man
yeah i'm protecting you from the bait by
not putting it up on the screen because
i don't want you to waste your good
judgment juice on on fake posts
and so many of these are fake posts
how about this one
this seems the more mundane
the happier i am because i think it's
more likely to be realistic like so many
of the fake posts are like me 75 male
and my girlfriend 19 f female
who is blind um were
in an ambulance on the way to the moon
whereas this one is it i mean this seems
pedestrian and i i'm more likely to
believe it as a result maybe i have a
bias towards that am i the [ __ ] for
leaving the house while my girlfriend is
still sleeping
let's find out
so i made plans for us to get up go to
work at a
go get up go work at a coffee shop not
as a barista but on your laptop okay
then meet my family for lunch then go to
the market very nice day honestly
sounds like a very nice day
so that sounds delightful my girlfriend
likes to sleep in and i get up super
early 5 30 to 6 a.m i told her i wanted
to leave
early like 7 00 a.m because i had a ton
of work to do before seeing my family
this is tough because everybody's got
their own standards
but leaving the house at 7 00 a.m
when you're not go like i get that he's
getting work done but you're not going
to like a shift that starts at eight
that's too early in my opinion
if she doesn't have to be there like
leaving the house at seven a.m
bro i'm at work at seven
yeah but this she's not working
like she doesn't have to be there you
know what i'm not saying seven is like
too early to open your eyes and be awake
i'm just saying like you know you're
starting a he planned for a very nice
day
she has to be up at 6 15 so she can take
a shower so she could dry her hair to
leave the house at 7am
why does i mean if he's got to get some
work done why doesn't he just get some
work done from seven to nine
in his apartment
and then when she wakes up and she's
ready to go they could go to the coffee
shop and do some more i mean it's just
these are very normal hours
i'm telling you i'm i'm out of the house
at like 7 30 sometimes there's [ __ ]
nobody on the sidewalk and i live in a
big city
at 4pm it's rush hour you're getting
electric scooters are crashing into you
uber eats cyclists with like big
backpacks full of soups that are half
spilled are jostling right next to you
not that many people are leaving the
house at 7 00 a.m for a day of leisure
if they are they're going to the damn
mountain or something like that they're
not going to starbucks but anyway
she expressed how exhausted and tired
she was yesterday so this morning when i
woke up at six considering we went to
bed at 11 30 pm i didn't wake her up and
let her sleep
i got ready to leave and went to give
her a kiss goodbye while telling her
take all the time you need meet me at
the coffee shop i don't want to rush you
i know you're tired she all of a sudden
said go gets all cold with me saying omg
why didn't you wake me up
i thought we were going to go together
dare roll
she said we're leaving at 6 15. tell me
my ass isn't sitting in the car until 6
45 i come inside she's stepping out the
damn shower like can i help you
i look this woman in her optic stems
and i said
honestly this is this is relatable
i don't think i've ever had a situation
like this
to be honest
i think i would just be chilling in the
liv i'll be getting my work done in the
living room you got wi-fi like i don't
understand
i expressed i wanted to let her sleep
because i know how tired she was and she
can just meet me later later being an
hour later so she can get ready while i
get a head start on my work like are you
the barista
i
then you gotta go i understand
i i just i don't know i just don't
understand why you gotta be at the
coffee shop to start your work
it just seems like you could do like a
split shift and do half of it in the
living room and half of it at the
starbucks
i finally leave the house she texts me
basically saying she doesn't understand
why i was able to wake her up to say
goodbye but not able to wake her up when
i woke up she later texts me arguing
saying that it isn't fair that we made
plans and i'm going off on my own
without her all i wanted to do was make
her sleep in more because i know how
tired she was
she starts with the name calling etc
what
and i told her instead of arguing with
me since you're already up get ready and
come the coffee place is 10 minutes from
our house she says she doesn't want to
drive there and pay for parking and pay
for gas relatable in the in with the
current prices for sure
i don't know if she expected me to drive
back and pick her up i really think
she's being a baby i would to be honest
with you i would agree with that
as much as i think that this dude's a
little
he's a little too early pilled for my
standards
i do think she's being a little bit of a
baby about it
unreliable narrator yeah it's kind of
like this is like the 2022's house of
leaves
my i think she's being a baby my
solution would be get in your car drive
over it's not that difficult i apologize
for not waking her up but i genuinely
just wanted her to sleep she finally
basically cancels all our daily plans
and says have a nice day
i'm sitting in the coffee shop alone now
it's been two hours she isn't coming
so am i the [ __ ] for leaving while
she's sleeping no she's the [ __ ] even
though i kind of sorry i need to scroll
down a little bit sorry sorry um
she's the [ __ ] for sure i don't think
this is everybody sucks at all
at at some point i mean i guess i can't
say in every relationship but have i had
situations where my wife said hey i want
to get up early tomorrow
wake me up when you get up at 6 30
and then she comes to bed at like 12 and
i'm like well this is uh
this is a damn poison pill man
you want you want me to be the first
thing you see when you when you open
your eyes after not getting a good
night's sleep
i seems like i'm kind of accepting a
suicide pass on that one
the alternative is that and and i kate
would say the same thing it doesn't
happen all the time but it happens now
and then you know
you get up and you're faced with the
decision
am i gonna wake up my wife because she
told me to wake her up and risk that
she's gonna be um
annoyed with me because she's not gonna
feel like she had a good night's sleep
or am i gonna let her sleep a little bit
not because i'm protecting her feelings
but because i know that how important a
good night's sleep is to her
everybody's gonna find themselves in
that position from time to time and can
i be honest with you
i've done both
there's been times where i was like you
know
she needs to do something in the am
and then you just take the you take the
bullet you wake her up at 6 30 and say
you told me to do this
and then there's some times where she's
like i would like to get up earlier
tomorrow can you wake me up
and then i leave like i i get up from my
side of the bed and she looks like she's
deep in rem sleep and i'm like i'm not
gonna wake her up are you insane
you gotta you gotta be out of your mind
if you think i'm gonna like if someone
looks like they're dead while they're
sleeping i'm like if they're like
rolling around and like you know then
you can shake them a little bit but if
they look like they're dead
i'm not going to wake you up unless it's
urgent
any i don't even think we need to look
at the comments you're not the [ __ ]
obviously your girlfriend is a little
insane
it is funny that you had so much work to
do in the damn coffee shop and yet
you're
spending all this time typing up the
damn reddit posts
no wonder you got to get to the coffee
shop you got two hours of work you're
stretching it out to six hours
i mean i'm not saying he shouldn't have
woken her up i guess all i'm saying is
like she should understand that she
didn't get woken up because he wanted
her to sleep more
you know there's not that there's no
reason to blow up a a a parenthetical
very nice day over over a judgment call
like that
okay let me let me guess am i the
[ __ ] for being upset that my sister
made me a birthday cake
my sister has a purple heart she was
shot in the peace corps
trying to deliver medicine
in mali in 2009.
just give me a second here let me let me
find it
let let me find the part where like you
go in on somebody for being an [ __ ]
and then there's actually like a
condition that means they have to be an
[ __ ] and you can't judge them
i'm not reading this this is this is
teenage drama
this this post boils down to
my sister made me a birthday cake but
the cursive writing on the cake looked
really bad
okay
god i miss being 17.
this [ __ ] would ruin your night the
cursive on my cake
like the lady on uh
on kitchen nightmares on that one
episode where they ran out of buns so
they have to serve her a burger on
sourdough bread and she's like
i just i've never been in a restaurant
where they ran out of
buns before like it's just really it's
just really hard
oh man
i think we got one more in us
oh
am i the [ __ ] for not making my son's
friend breakfast i just it's so
oh okay so this is it here you go it's i
was gonna be like you just chose not to
then at the end of it
i'm a single mom and groceries are
expensive okay fine
you you got me no you're not an [ __ ]
fair enough also sweden detected
this post is brought to you by sweden
am i the [ __ ] for not telling my
boyfriend how i dude i i it's only
because i respect the eu's right to be
forgotten laws for internet privacy that
i don't go in the the internet archive
and go to this am i the [ __ ] for the
strict schedule i have my kids on post
has been deleted
oh
that [ __ ] would have been so good
i could have chewed on that bone for
like 20 minutes man
you deleted it come on okay
am i the [ __ ] for not telling my
boyfriend how much money i make
that's how we know it was real that's
true
the that we need the [ __ ] we need to go
to our slash am i the [ __ ] deleted
because no throwaway would ever delete
something they'd be like look at how mad
people are i'm an amazing creative
writer
it's only when people start to get blow
back on a real story that they're like i
gotta remove i gotta get this [ __ ] out
of here immediately
okay
am i the [ __ ] for not telling my
boyfriend how much money i make
i'm baffled by this situation i'm 24 i
finished college last year and i've been
working since then in my current job i
do not make a huge amount of money but i
make enough to take care of myself and
afford some nice things my boyfriend is
29 he works in tech and he makes a lot
more than me i've never asked him he
volunteered this info many times
he does work in
tech he told me that by the way
amazing sentence this is actually a
great writer
because what she could have said to to
get people to in her head she would have
been like this would get more people on
my side she could have said my boyfriend
always volunteers how much he makes and
it makes me feel belittled but she
didn't have to write that she just wrote
what happened and then is letting normal
people interpret that and i'm like i
already have a preconceived notion about
her boyfriend as a result that's great
writing that's showing not telling i
don't need to know how you feel you said
how you feel just by saying what
happened
he told me he was planning to propose
soon but he actually can't do it without
knowing his stance on some important
things about me
not unreasonable
those important things are my financial
situation
you you should not get married without
knowing that
that seems fair to me that doesn't seem
like an unreasonable thing if you're
gonna
you know
if you're gonna marry somebody how my
family would react to his proposal
because we come from different cultures
okay whether we would move in together
after we're engaged again it's a culture
thing
okay i told him my financial situation i
don't have any debt and i'm in the
process of saving up and building an
emergency fund before i can think of
what i'll do with my money
now again now you've done the same thing
you did in the first paragraph but
you've done it in a different way
it's the it's the and they're not
married
but it's the my money part of that
that just to me is doing a lot of the
heavy lifting at least in my own brain
right now
you're talking about getting married
it is your money
but also
if you get married it's
kind of your money i guess everybody's
got a different
arrangement for that sort of stuff but
anyway
he needs to know how much i make exactly
i don't want to tell him but i give him
a range
still not enough he's so mad about it he
says finances are important for a couple
and he needs to know i'm financially
responsible but if he needs a specific
amount to know that i say he doesn't
actually know me and maybe he should use
his critical thinking skills and look at
all the time we spent together and
conclude whether i'm actually
responsible with my money or not
he accused me of not trusting him and
hiding things
and he told me he can't be around me
right now and left actual
sanest uh
fiance or boyfriend in uh in reddit
history
rare sane
man on reddit in a post
i'm actually baffled that it's creating
such a fight am i wrong i don't want to
share that
but listen
you don't have to share your salary
but you kind of have to share it with
your if you want to get married to
somebody
you don't have to like tell somebody on
the bus the exact dollar amount that you
make annually but like i think you kind
of it's a reasonable standard to to tell
your spouse
i also don't understand why you would
give a range but then be like i'm not
gonna give you the exact number
also like
so when you gave him a range
your actual salary was just the exact
midpoint right like nobody in the middle
of an argument is gonna be like i'm
gonna give a range and i'm gonna be near
the bottom end right like nobody they're
they're just gonna be like okay i make
65 000 a year i make between 60 and 70.
so like just the first thing i would say
is read between the lines
i just don't understand though why you
would be like here's a range what i
don't know was the range like a million
dollar range like i make between one and
a million dollars otherwise like why
would you be so concerned about the
specific number it just doesn't make
sense to me
like if i i would assume depending on
her salary that a reasonable range might
be like 10 to 20 000 you couldn't just
bite the bullet and be like
it's in the middle of those that number
that i gave you
one to ten more billion
i mean if she's making a more billion
dollars a year
be careful because she works for sony
pictures
i don't necessarily think she's hiding
something i just think she's being kind
of a weirdo
it just seems like a weird thing to be
like i refuse to give you an exact
number instead i'm going to give you an
estimate
and then draw a line in the sand and be
like that's too much
all no debt is is great don't get me
wrong
maybe look i've got too many plus twos
let's farm some minus twos i don't like
the way the husband said tell me about
your financial situation and part of her
reply is i'm still considering what to
do with my money
i feel like if
a
potential wife asked her husband that
question
and the husband said i'm still figuring
out what to do with my money
people would be like
well
if we get married
we'll talk about what to do with that
money i wouldn't even say our money i'll
just say we'll talk about because like
i know they're not engaged yet but like
two people that are like in a
relationship together not married maybe
she's saving up some money to buy a jet
ski but if they're going to get married
you might want to start talking about
hey that jet ski fund that you're
working on
you know depending on how we're going to
do the marriage you know they need a
deposit for the wedding planner and the
venue and maybe we're going to work on
getting a down payment or something like
that and
so like you might have to be like
you know put the jet ski off to the side
although he is also very boastful about
his salary so maybe he's that's going to
come back to bite him in the ass maybe
he's going to pay for a jet ski and the
wedding and the down payment but i don't
know
but i don't know not everybody is the
same with their their married financials
for sure like some people are like
everything's in a pool and then some
people are like
we have separate finances but like a
shared household account that we both
put uh
money into in order to cover shared
living expenses and stuff like not
everybody's on the same page
but i do think it's
reasonable to know your spouse's salary
that's i mean i get that they're not
married yet
but i could also understand like i don't
think the guy overreacted
i think he asked for what should be open
information between
a married couple and she said i refuse
to give it to you and he's like okay
weirdos see you in like two days that
seems totally normal to me
i don't know i made i don't see a lot of
disagreement but
hold up i do want i'm a glutton for
punishment let's go find the first not
the [ __ ] comment
it's probably the top comment
imo if you're not willing to share that
information with him i suspect you have
other concerns okay
saying read it or spotted in my opinion
everybody sucks here okay but like
how does the boyfriend suck is just
that's my only question she sucks i'm
not debating that
i have okay just one second
bf has told op he won't propose unless
she discloses income op has decided she
won't disclose income until after he
proposes chicken or the egg just because
two people
have a condition like this does not mean
it's an unsolvable chicken or the egg
that's not how chicken in the egg works
chicken in the egg is like we don't know
what came first because one came from
the other
this is somebody trying to create a
chicken in the egg situation when
actually one person has a reasonable
request and then the other person is
like i will not fulfill your reasonable
request
it's like you know
if what if he was like
hey do you have a criminal record and
she was like well i'm not going to tell
you that until you propose that's not a
chicken in the egg situation you're
about to marry a felon
it's not a catch-22 it's just one person
having an
one person creating deadlock for no
reason
yo aaron thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
she's yeah she's holding information
ransom
i'll give you a range of felonies i've
committed
oh my god
hi i know you're getting some rough
comments in this thread so i wanted to
shed some perspective
i've been in your shoes coming from a
different cultural background with
certain subjects only come to light
post-engagement or post-marriage i am a
1.5 gen immigrant in a relationship with
a much less conservative partner
you are currently 24 and still learning
your own footing in the world with your
career your salary and your role in this
relationship
you have likely your whole life
considered and set milestones of well
okay without being rude blah blah blah i
believe this is a soft you're the
[ __ ]
not because of what people are saying
but because you are saying
that you are comfortable being in a
relationship with someone with these
guards up i don't believe you are ready
to be serious enough for an engagement
and that is fine but it's there's no
like
you gotta i i don't think this is right
i think she just needs to disclose the
information
so now you're taking it a step further
that's like oh because she's unwilling
to
disclose this information she's too like
she's not emotionally prepared for
marriage
people are insane everybody's insane in
their own way if you waited until
everything in your life was like exactly
lined up to hit major milestones you
would never go anywhere
it's just you know you've gone too far
you've gone too far in the other
direction of like you're not mature
enough to get married right now
good luck in your journey what the
what are you good luck at your journey
it's just an argument man
don't understand good luck in your
journey
your journey to text your husband your
salary
you better pack a granola bar
if you're not ready to share then you
aren't ready to get married and your
boyfriend needs to move on
if you're not ready to get married right
away you guys should just break up
you're 24.
you're the [ __ ] with engagement in
the cards i'll assume you guys are in a
long-term relationship so he deserves to
know yeah i mean okay reasonable very
reasonable
finances are a key okay it's too
reasonable these are too reasonable
too reasonable
where's my where's my insane redditors
at
where where's all the redditors that
were posting in the the seven thousand
dollar home gym where a guy almost
watched his stepson die
that were like he disrespected you you
should throw her [ __ ] on the sidewalk
outside and change the locks
you're the [ __ ] why are you dying on
this hill why are you unwilling to share
the exact amount
why not tell him forgot to tell you
you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] lol holy cow
she's getting lit up man
you're the [ __ ] i don't know if
you're a troll or not because you keep
arguing and repeating yourself you're
the [ __ ] not ready to get married
soft you're the [ __ ] you're the oh my
god
holy cow
you're the [ __ ] you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] yeah i'm not starting
to feel bad for this lady man she's
getting damn rolled
this is crazy
there's not as like a single dissenting
opinion here
oh my god i'm scrolling i'm down in the
freaking 49 upvotes
anyway well
that was fun
they're beating their ass in the quote
retweets you're not wrong i'm going to
slash



pencil
am i the [ __ ] for giving my
mother-in-law a gift with strings
attached and then refusing to let her to
pay me back
i don't
fully understand the post
the all the in-law am i the [ __ ] end
up being classics too there's always
something ridiculous like am i the
[ __ ] for uh
exiling my mother-in-law from the family
because she wore the dress i wanted to
wear
uh to the spring semi-formal to our
cocktail garden party like it's always
like
nine-figure net worth problems
that don't make any sense to normal
people
mother-in-law and i got off to a rough
start but i'm currently pregnant and
would love to put that behind us i heard
mother-in-law talking about wanting to
see a touring musical that was going to
be in town but she didn't find out until
the last minute and couldn't get tickets
my friend's dad
manages the theater and i figured i
could get her two tickets they have some
reserved vip and handicapped seats and
if they aren't sold out the night of he
will sometimes let me know sometimes let
someone he knows use them okay very
reasonable preamble
i got her two seats but i asked that
she'd not bring her boyfriend okay now
you've crossed over in one in less than
one sentence you've crossed over into
insane territory
why do so many people online do this
there's like a cultural sickness man
that people are like they can't just do
something nice they're like if i do
something nice for you
you gotta
do something for me in receiving the
gift
keep reading he's terrible okay sure
maybe i'll i'll hear her out hear her
out okay okay okay
he's been a huge [ __ ] to me he makes
fun of my husband and i constantly he's
videotaped us fighting and showing
people
and he at one point had a group chat
where he was telling his friends about
our issues he claims he can't help
himself because it is so funny and he is
addicted at this point i don't even want
to be around the man he smirks when we
speak and i couldn't stand the thought
of my gift going to him anyway holy cow
it's so funny
is this is kind of hilarious though
like not good but kind of hilarious but
this is a situation where you don't give
your mother-in-law a gift you can't
reconcile with just one half of a couple
especially in a in a marriage situation
i'm not saying they have to do
everything together but in terms of like
their diplomacy they're a unit they
probably tell each other everything
even the things they said that were
between you know just the person that
told them in the first place and them
you there's no way you can't cleave it
it's uncleavable
at least in this context
it gets even more crazy
even more crazy than the guy filming
them fighting and sharing the video and
saying he can't stop because it's so
funny
mother-in-law said that was kind of
weird but he doesn't like musicals so
it's fine well my friend works at the
theater as an usher and mentions seeing
mother-in-law's boyfriend my friend
didn't know about the deal but just
wanted to mention how hot this guy was
and i immediately felt betrayed i called
mother-in-law and asked her about it
mother-in-law told me that i was being
weirdly controlling that she doesn't
have friends she kind of does but her
only close friend recently confessed
being in love with her so i get that she
didn't want to hang out one-on-one with
him
and that she thought her boyfriend would
actually like it because it wasn't as
girly as most shows
they definitely saw hamilton man there's
no doubt
i tried telling her how hurt i was but
she snapped at me that it was a rude
gift anyway
at this point i was done and just didn't
want to talk to her i needed space
because i was so hurt but she recently
approached me at a family dinner got all
pissy she said she calculated what
tickets cost and wanted to pay me back
so i would shut up lol i wasn't even
talking to her
but i refused to take the money so she
ended up throwing it on the floor and
leaving it there i left the money when i
left so hey her parents made a profit
off family dinner
the family is really torn about who's in
the wrong here
okay i did i mean
maybe this is the controversial one
i don't think this is everybody sucks
here
and
give me a moment here to plead my case
okay
the mother-in-law sounds like
she's married to
a total [ __ ]
but you can't expect
her
to be receptive to a comment like hey
your husband's a [ __ ] don't i'm
sorry boyfriend okay your boyfriend's a
[ __ ]
don't bring him to the play
you can't like you can't
do that's a ridiculous statement
you need like i'm trying to figure out
how to elucidate it further but it's
like it's like a parent thing you know
you can have opinions about
your friends parents your spouse's
parents
but you only go to the level
of
vitriol that they go to because they're
so much more closely related
so like if your mother-in-law's
boyfriend is an [ __ ] you can only
with her
go to the level of
shade that she goes to in fact you might
even have to go one step back from that
you can never be the person that is the
aggressor in
like admonishing the partner of a friend
or a family member
you you always have to be like at their
level or slightly below
that's all i'm saying so you can't i
don't think you can give someone a gift
and then add a string attached that's
like hey we both know your boyfriend's
an [ __ ] so please don't bring him
because i hate him that's so i i think
in that situation you either don't give
the gift or
you
accept that she's probably gonna take
her boyfriend and you just say that's
fine because i'm doing a nice thing for
you anyway and i'm just gonna you know
suck it up you you can't you can't
separate the two
or just give one ticket i mean now we're
getting into like
i mean these are first world problems
at this point if someone gave me like a
ticket well let me put it if someone
gave kate one ticket to a play
i would be like what the [ __ ]
like i would i would
maybe not take immediate offense but i
would be like what's going on with that
like i know this person and they said
hey my my dad works at the theater sorry
he could only get you one ticket
with an empty seat next to you
yes so i know it's weird
it's a violation of
standard op operating procedure for
relationships
yeah married couples count as one person
like how corporations count as people
now
common n l bad take i don't i'm just
like it's it just doesn't seem
i know they're not married i'm just
saying they're old
when you're old and you have a boyfriend
you're married
okay you're in your 20s you're gonna
have a boyfriend or you can have a
husband if you're 45 i'm sorry the
person you're dating is your husband
that's just the way it works okay it's
like how all cats are girls and all dogs
are boys
my grandma's like 75
if she was like this is my boyfriend
sven i would be like in my head i'd be
like that's my new step granddad
come on you're like you're old i'm not
saying you couldn't break up at some
point but you're basically married
you're so old that anybody you date
you're married to by default
that's how it works man
they're not married i know mary by the
fall cause they're old okay
unless she's got two boyfriends then
she's got
then she's got two boyfriends
and maybe one husband but i don't know
that's her business
quite frankly
anyway i don't know i don't i mean i in
the situ the mother-in-law might suck
for dating a huge [ __ ]
but i don't think anything she did in
this situation
points to her having done anything wrong
i mean she did lie to the person who
gave her the ticket but i don't think
it's
an [ __ ] move to disobey a ridiculous
command
i think if somebody gives you a gift
with a string attached and it sounds
like you know
if i was being arrested and the police
officer said put your hands behind your
back i would do it if he said
you know
sing your favorite song from sesame
street i would be like over my dead body
you don't have the right
there's no there's no lack of morality
in disobeying uh
an insane request
that shouldn't have been offered in the
first place
i also i don't think she's the ass over
throwing the money on the ground i mean
i think honestly the
the op is mad that the mother-in-law got
one over on her she wanted a a gift in
the gift bank but she didn't want to pay
the true cost which was giving joy to
somebody that she didn't like
justifiably so so then she refused to
take the payment back because she's like
no no no we can't be even i want you to
forever be in my debt so i can like
resent you or call it back later and
then the mother-in-law said [ __ ] that
she threw the money and then rather than
pick up the money
which is your prerogative not just
because you bought her the gift in the
first place but because it's on someone
else's floor you said no i'm not owned
i'm not owned and you left the money
there
for the family to clean up and now be in
possession of like maybe a couple
hundred bucks that they don't know what
to do they're not gonna feel comfortable
spending it now they probably just got
like a little pile of cash on their
on their end table or something like
that where they're like i don't know if
i'm supposed to spend it because it
belongs to like two different people and
nobody simultaneously like it's just a
just a horrible situation
it's just idiotic and petty
anyway i don't know i feel like op's the
[ __ ]
i also feel like the mother-in-law is an
[ __ ] probably but not for anything in
this post which is which is how we judge
that
that's my two cents
firm you're the [ __ ] you gave your
mother-in-law two tickets if you didn't
want it to invite her bf you should have
just given her one ticket based in chat
pill
yeah why do you know what what about two
tickets but you go with your
mother-in-law or two tickets and her son
goes with his mother like that's that's
a much more sensible solution than one
ticket or two tickets you can choose
whoever you want to go with but it can't
be this one person that you're closest
to
be like hey i got you and my husband
tickets to see this musical
and what's your husband going to say
when it's his mother that introduced it
to you
anyway
you're the [ __ ] if you were giving
the gift to improve the relationship
this wasn't the way to go about it
probably something she understands now
if i had to guess
you're the [ __ ] you can't give
someone two tickets for themselves and
demand them to not give it to someone a
gift is a gift why do you even care you
should expect them to take their partner
if you didn't want her to bring her
boyfriend you shouldn't have gotten them
the tickets even later when she
understood you didn't want your money
and she wanted to pay you back you
refused you are being exhausting to be
honest just an incredible it being told
that you're exhausting is actually like
the adult version of hearing from your
parents that they're not mad they're
just disappointed in you
like if i was having an argument with
somebody and they said you're being
exhausting i would be like oh i just
lost the argument instantly
that hurts
hello
what was that
she said hey and hi at the same time
am i the [ __ ] for making fun of how
my wife said hi to me
me
71 m and my wife
19f
by the way i don't know if this is
relevant but sometimes she eats food
with their hands i only eat food with
the designated
uh fork that i'm
am i the [ __ ] for making fun of my
wife for using her salad fork to eat her
entree
wow this is a thorny one okay honestly
this is exhausting
get hit
you're the [ __ ]
oh whoa whoa whoa dude look at this info
this you
oh
damn nice work
mother-in-law troll
good job collecting so many of the
mother-in-law troll posts
i don't even want to read am i the
[ __ ] because they're almost always
made up yo get audited dude
i love that
well anyway i'm glad we wasted a bunch
of our time on that fake creative
writing prompt but hey even here's the
thing just because it's fiction
i still feel like you can get something
out of it i mean i only read nonfiction
books and watch documentaries because
there's just so much beauty in the real
world that i'm curious about but
after that happened i'm like you know
what i realized the value of fiction
because we still discuss things that are
relevant to the real world even if this
unique situation didn't actually happen
in vivo
am i the [ __ ] for saying i told you
so
at my sister-in-law and brother's
wedding
i see an edit i see that the edit says
facebook in it i'm good to go
it's perfect
man who enjoys every mcu film only
watches documentaries excuse me i did
not enjoy
black widow okay
don't slander me
no one did
yeah
seven out of ten come on don't be
it's better than the gray man but like
anyway let's get going here
i i-27f have known for sister-in-law for
three years she's the type of person
that always needs to be right and needs
to be in charge of everything she's very
demanding as well can i tell you just
from this sentence i actually already
like her more than the op
my sister-in-law's family members are
very disrespectful and rude they don't
clean up after themselves
expect everyone to act like maids or
servants around them and they think very
highly of themselves they can never be
wrong and think that they can do no
wrong because of this my sister-in-law's
family doesn't really punish their kids
like they have no consequences they
aren't even the gentle parenting type
either my sister-in-law's sister
okay i understand
that's that's a genuine relationship
sister-in-law's sister
but wait isn't your sister-in-law's
sister your wife's sister
or your husband's sister
not always
it's just some lady
we got to come up with better names for
these man
no that would be another sister-in-law
but yeah isn't his sister-in-law's
okay oh no no no
no
no because your
if you
your wife's sister
is your sister-in-law
wait yeah it totally would be okay i'm
sorry
i need to i need to see the the
mendelian punnett square for this one to
understand
your brother's wife's sister
ah
okay i got it all right yeah see this is
what happens when you don't grow up with
siblings all this stuff that's probably
like
common knowledge it's part of the
vernacular
for for people that grew up with
siblings this is my 18th cousin twice
removed oh i know exactly what that
means
i don't know any of that i know you know
the furthest down the family tree that i
understand is actually cousin my cousin
had a child i have no idea what that
child is in relation to me
i
genuinely have no is that a second
cousin
that's a second cousin
how do they get removed
is it when that baby marries someone
their spouse would be
my second cousin once removed
that person would be a stranger
well like my cousin is basically a
stranger to me her child is a complete
stranger
i mean at what point did this like i
don't think there should be a second
cousin i think that's just a guy
that's no longer part of my family i'm
sorry to say and i don't me i'm not
harboring any ill will towards them but
that's just a person
my cousin's child is not part of my
family that's just uh that's a stranger
man
what do we share like point two five
percent of our dna or something like
that that's i probably share more dna
with the average like
cavendish banana
isn't that like eighty percent
i'm comparing two different ironically
i'm comparing apples to oranges i guess
pun intended
anyway
i'm not like they're literally part of
my family
but they're also literally a stranger
it's actually 6.25 i know
i have an undergrad in biology
i'm very uh
i'm very well versed in doing back of
the napkin math where you uh divide 100
by two x number of times
that's basically i mean that's they make
you do that on stage before they give
you your degree sorry i'm being
exhausting okay okay here we go sorry
sorry sorry
my okay
he throws tantrums this is my
sister-in-law's son he throws tantrums
if he doesn't get something and he has
to be the center of attention 24 7. when
they're when they're our birthdays he
needs a gift or opens the gifts and
needs to blow out candles it's
frustrating which is why i'm not usually
around at family gatherings and other
stuff okay so this little kid lives
rent-free in your brain and you don't
see your family because he's annoying to
you and somehow he's in the wrong here
even though you're the adult i was my
sister-in-law
i was at my sister-in-law's presumably
since her friend canceled on her and i
was helping make invitations i saw one
of the names was sister-in-law's nephew
i asked if she wanted him to go and she
said yeah she then asked why so i told
her why
i talked about the tantrums and how
he'll probably throw a fit during the
reception and other stuff she got mad
and said she didn't know what i was
talking about she told my family and her
sister which caused her sister to write
me a message saying how i was wrong and
other stuff like that
well the day of the wedding comes
everyone comes in happy except my nephew
he's crying and is about to throw a fit
when my sister-in-law came out he
literally started screaming the poor
pastor had to stop and wait for the
parents to leave during the after party
he was back again and crying
when they were cutting the cake he
screamed extremely loud he pushed my
sister-in-law
who was holding a glass of wine and
spilled on her he she started crying she
turned around to leave and i looked at
her and said i told you so she started
crying even more now oh
man yes
there there's never a good time for i
told you so
there's like
it feels great
so maybe it's worth doing sometimes but
you do have to accept that you pay a
cost you pay a social cost and you
probably gain some adrenaline sometimes
that's a fair trade
when i got home my mom called me
extremely immature and wants me to
apologize so am i the [ __ ] when i
went on facebook i saw a long post from
sister-in-law's sister basically saying
that sister-in-law knew how her nephew
was and how she didn't want him to throw
a tantrum she should have never invited
them she also called sister-in-law
selfish saying she should have offered
nephew to cut the cake with her
sister-in-law's family also agreed and
called sister-in-law selfish i went over
to his sister so she told me i was right
and now i should never have invited him
i still apologize though because i did
kick him kick her while she was down i
offered to pay to get her wedding dress
clean but she said that was fine
can i
i'm going to hit you with my once a day
who cares it's just not that big of a
deal
so it's like someone who
a nine-year-old in your extended family
who you're probably gonna see like four
more times over the course of your
entire life is annoying okay
that's your alarm going off time to get
ready for work again like it doesn't
affect anything just get a
it's not that big of a deal
it just doesn't i mean i yeah i'm just
gonna go ahead and say it it's
exhausting
this post is a little exhausting also
there were so many sister-in-law sisters
nephews that i don't even know
how far out we are here
like who the hell is your
sister-in-law's sister's nephew i could
not tell you who that kid's parents are
are you the child's parents of your
sister-in-law's sister's nephew like it
doesn't make sense to me
i just don't think it's that big of a
deal silence
it's a sister-in-law's nephew
it's your kid your sister-in-law's
nephew is your kid
is this a is this like the
his mom was the doctor
is it one of those is it like a is it a
prank
it's the son of the sister-in-law's
sister
what the hell
are they even related to this kid at all
i don't understand
am i the [ __ ] okay we're not touching
that one
am i the [ __ ] for wanting to spend
time with my daughter
flair [ __ ] okay let's check that out
two edits good start
oh man
sister-in-law's sister's
nephew
sister-in-law's sister's nephew i'm
still trying to puzzle this out in my
head
sister-in-law's sister's nephew
husband's brother's wife's sister's kid
what the hell
husband's brother's sister's wife's kid
the husband's brother's sister's wife is
your husband's sister
i don't get it man i gotta see the
punnett square it just i can't do this
math in my head
i gotta i gotta open up ms paint man
make it stop
my daughter was asked to move out of the
house
at 18 due to some conflict between her
and her dad i had no say in the decision
okay what
what what are you talking about
this is a little tragic but at the same
time i'm like what do you mean you had
no say in the situation you had no say
in whether or not your daughter got
kicked out of the house
is your husband a redditor
my husband felt like we raised her well
enough so she could take care of herself
and he also didn't pay her college
tuition like he was supposed to she
ended up postponing going to school for
a year so she can save some money
but you're
is it is okay maybe this is a an
ex-husband situation if there's still
but then i don't let's
i'm not touching this yeah i get stun
locked too easily she went to school on
the other side of the country and never
reached out to any of us and when she
does it's because she wants something
from us okay this very this standard
operating procedure for an 18 year old
that's been kicked out of the house
what do you think six months later she's
gonna call you and be like hey guys just
wanted to check in how's that house you
kicked me out of doing
her dad was very upset and turned her
away every time she asked us for
something a few months ago she reached
out about how she can't make rent and
she really needed a place to stay for
the summer i talked to my husband and
practically begged him so they're not
divorced
so i'm like i'm a little mad at the mom
like because it sounds like the husband
is an [ __ ] a little bit but like why
does she keep saying she has no control
in the situation
you got to put some pressure on it
you gotta
you know if he starts playing hardball
like that you got to start subtly
undermining the household
keep reading keep keep going i'm just
like i mean she's not playing
she if her husband's going to be a
little frank underwood
she's got to be a little claire
underwood you know they got to be like
on the same team but maybe they both
have some secret objectives you know
like you gotta especially when it comes
to your child you got to promote their
interest
she's yeah she's not playing game of
thrones
she's catering the red wedding
she's like there's nothing i could do i
knew about the plan in advance well
there's nothing i could do by the way
here's some uh
poison
pheasant
it's been a while since i've seen it
regardless
we i talked to my husband begged him we
found out later she lied to us about not
being able to afford a place to live and
she was living with her boyfriend who's
more than twice her age and he kicked
her out her dad was very furious about
the situation but we decided we're not
oh we are going to let her stay with us
for the summer that's big of you um
let me just say
maybe why you would not kick your child
out of the house at 18
if you were going to get mad they made
mistakes their their brain's not fully
developed yet they're there a child
still
they're not like 11.
you know i expect them to look both ways
when they cross the street but they're
still like a kid
i'm like
i don't know if it's a cultural thing
which is me saying i'm not american but
i don't think in 2022 you can kick your
kid out of the house at 18.
in 1950 sure
i guess it's kind of like the way it
went down back then but
with the way the world is now just
economically it just seems like you're
setting your kid up for
like a really hard road
if you have the means at least like
it just seems like you're you're not
setting them up for success
like how is an 18 year old supposed to
afford to live alone
they're supposed to be like a senior
software developer so they can afford a
a one-bedroom apartment in kansas city i
don't get it
and pay for college as well
largest plus two you've ever received
love it i'll take it
he said my city name he said my city
name he knows my city's name
anyway what she's since been back home
she got a job but she's barely in the
house i've been trying so hard to start
conversations with her but she always
finds a way to end them before we even
start with i don't know or i have a
headache i try my best to get her
involved in activities she used to enjoy
when she used to live with us but she
always turned them down
a few days ago i asked her to go
somewhere with me
she ended up screaming at me she asked
me if i'm not catching the hint that she
doesn't want to be around me and she's
only here because she has nowhere else
to go she said i should carry on with my
life like i did when she wasn't around
and that i'm an [ __ ] for invading her
personal space all i wanted to do was
for us to have some mother-daughter time
so am i the [ __ ]
i want to make it clear she's not
missing the opportunity to have an
education she took out some student
loans and she's going to school i also
failed to mention her dad is helping her
out with tuition next semester allegedly
speaking a source
dr manhattan image source i made it up
source because i said so
and she's still being indifferent
towards us even when we're making an
effort to help her after that you know
one year period where we didn't make an
effort to help her at all
after reading some of the comments i
realized i made a mistake and didn't
realize the pain that i caused to my
daughter i will be apologizing and talk
to her dad about how we can help her
with her student loans um
uh
bad parents
sorry
i think you know
i'm not the parent of a 18 year old i'm
sure you know
it's tough you know it's different but
like there's a fine line between
teaching your kids personal
responsibility by allowing them to face
consequences for their actions and
forcing them out into a world that
they're woefully unprepared for without
you know the protective infrastructure
that allows them to make mistakes
without having catastrophic consequences
so like
i mean i don't know honestly it sounds
like your dad idolizes uh cold war
america in the 1950s and has this weird
idea in his head uh like michael douglas
and falling down where you know when
kids on their 18th birthday they get
kicked out of the house and then they
get like a job as a cashier working 20
hours a week and they get an apartment
and then after like 18 months of living
in that apartment they get the money for
a down payment on a house and then they
get out and then by the time they're 22
they got four kids but i don't think we
live in that world anymore
um
i think your your dad
his favorite movie without a doubt is
greece and he's living in a fictional
world right now and he made it a very
large parenting mistake
that's how it sounds to me it sounds
like i i completely understand why your
daughter resents you and uh
i think you should work to repair the
relationship that's my two cents as as
someone who's ignorant at least she
recognizes like that she did something
wrong i don't think we need to read the
comments they're just gonna make us feel
bad
am i the [ __ ] for not letting my mom
use my computer when she needs to do an
assignment for her master's degree
come on man
like
[Laughter]
i just i'm trying to see like what why
it's only a seven upvotes right it's not
like it's a big
post but like i just need to see what
like this is crazy man
she needs to use a certain software and
her current computer doesn't let her
download the software i see okay the kid
is 16. still i gotta read it
i 16 told her she could use my brother's
computer he's 12. not mine because i
have a ton of tabs open for stuff i'm
working on
your mom's getting a master's degree kid
i don't know if that line's gonna work
she said he she doesn't want to because
he'd get mad at her and i wouldn't she's
not the one who bought me the computer
my dad did and when i asked her to get
me a computer four years ago she said
she wouldn't however my brother who was
12 has broken three computers in the
past two years and she gets him a
replacement every time i just really
don't want her using my computer because
she doesn't wash her hands when she does
anything and her workplace is really
gross not to mention whatever software
she's gonna download will probably lag
my computer
why i could be the [ __ ] my brother is
actively playing games whereas i'm not
actively using my computer at the moment
and she needs a computer at some point
in the next three days
or i'll fail my or she'll fail her
assignment am i the [ __ ] it's my
property and when i told her no she kept
saying how i'm a bad person it's so
funny
it's actually just really hilarious
i have a ton of tabs open for stuff i'm
working on i'm not actively using my
computer at the moment so which is it
you're the [ __ ] just let her use the
computer this is where i wish i had the
the sound board
hit the one that's like oh
oh
i'm not reading the update apparently
it's on instagram i think this kid's
trying to kick-start his
uh his influencer career
he can put the update in the reddit if
he wants me to read it okay
i know you're young but you're the
[ __ ] i mean dude i don't know like
again i i do understand the kid's point
of view to some extent and i've been on
the other side of that but as the parent
i'm like well you know i paid for
everything in your life for 16 years and
you're not going to let me use your
computer for two hours so i can get a
master's degree and make our life better
all right like i would
maybe you shouldn't call your kid like a
bad person but like
i think you should be like sorry i'm
taking possession of
of your uh of your computer
please read the update it's not on
instagram okay hold on i'm i'm getting
the update
kind of
i don't understand
the up when i clicked on the update
it took me to uh the only comment in the
thread
where someone agreed with him
that's it
like that's the
i don't understand
that's the only one he read i don't i
just don't understand how there's an
update it's not update
read it was just saying like instead of
like hey let your mom use the laptop the
the post just says uh
hey if your brother won't let your mom
use his laptop then your mom needs to be
a better mom to him and you're like okay
[ __ ] maybe that's true
as we all know if you were just a good
parent your 12 year old wouldn't be an
[ __ ]
you know 12 year olds notoriously very
empathetic to the people around them um
also how does that help me get my
master's assignment done
that's a there's a very long-term
solution to a very acute problem
i guess i'll get in my time machine
and uh
raise the child a little differently so
that in 10 years i can
ask him to use his computer to type up
an assignment for 90 minutes
some of these man i don't know
am i the [ __ ] for not following the
school supply standards for my children
okay
let's see we got 20 minutes left
probably automatic yes
i don't even know the the premise what
what are the school supply standards
like they were only supposed to get
their kid
like pens and pencils and then their kid
shows up with an ipad or something
i gotta read it i gotta know
they got the number one pencils that but
the scantron won't won't be able to read
it man if they use a number one pencil
how are the standardized tests for the
kindergarteners supposed to get uh
graded if the scantron can't figure it
out hold on our screen region's a little
bit messed up here
oh and now i've actually i am a boomer
now i've accidentally clicked to the
left of the screen which apparently on
reddit is uh you meant to use the back
button right and i'm like what the hell
boomer boomer
i 35 male have two children 9m and 5m my
littlest one is going into kindergarten
i was so excited to properly include him
in our school shopping routine he's
always tagged along with his brother and
gotten his own arts and crafts stuff to
use at home of course but there's a new
layer of excitement this year all right
cute and wholesome
we always allow independence and choices
as long as it doesn't become
inconvenient for example if my kid picks
out the 120 count crayons we might
redirect him to the 96 count instead
since it's easier to carry around in his
backpack
good five-year-old doesn't need 96
crayons man that's too much
that's ridiculous he like 16 crayons at
most that covers like
like the rainbow and all the semitones
you know you got the whole thing
anyway other than practicality we don't
try to persuade them in any way this is
not
smart
like i
i'm re
i understand what the
dad is
the dad if you're not a parent the dad
is hitting you with some subtext early
he's hitting you with a signal and the
signaling is
he's montessori pilled which is fine but
he lets his kids do whatever they want
and if they suggest something really
dumb he's like no what if we do the
second dumbest thing instead
i'm not saying you should be like no you
get four crayons like that's it i'm just
saying
you know i think you could you could
provide a little bit more guidance than
that that but that's it there's a large
difference in philosophy there
other than practically we read it it's
always a fun experience and a great way
to kick off the school year and to
relive some of those oh god my baby's
leaving me fierce for my husband and i
with our five-year-old i can i say
something else as a value judgment
i think it's
it's just a little and it's not
a big problem
he's devoted a lot of text to how much
he loves
shopping for school supplies that just
seems like a little bit
like more than i would expect for an
adult
doesn't have to be a chore but like the
fact that he's getting so much enjoyment
out of it because you know what and i'm
going back in time now
i show up to school with the buffalo
pencil case i got like the little pencil
sharpener i got uh you know some lined
paper and i got the the binders where
you have to go
and then the [ __ ] rings snap open and
obviously if you if you pinch your
finger when you close the ring you're
gonna lose it but they open with so much
force that just the ring popping open
can actually draw blood if your hand is
in the wrong spot and then you look to
the person next to you and it's probably
uh
somebody named elizabeth
who is
you know six inches taller than you in
the seventh grade
and she's got a five-star
binder for every single school subject
even though you're in middle school and
then she's got her pencils like this is
the number two pencil this is my pen
this is my gel pen this is my and i'm
like
this is this is that kid growing up
who i've got to ask for a pencil because
i forgot to bring one
and then they go just make sure i you
give it back i'm gonna give it back
i'm not out here in the in the habit of
stealing pencils from my classmates like
i don't i don't get any value out of
that
anyway
we usually grab quite a few items on the
teacher's wish list as well and make a
point to wrap it up nicely as a little
thank you present from our children to
the educator that will be spending the
year with them
this year upon receiving the school
supplies list there is a note made at
the top that all supplies should be
exactly as listed on the sh on the sheet
such as a 24 pack of crayons excuse me
what are is is this alaska cave painting
how am i supposed to weave a fresco with
a mere 24 crayons
it doesn't seem possible
but 96 crayons for a five-year-old is
actually so funny too have you ever seen
a five-year-old draw
like they could accomplish the same
thing with two crayons
i had 96 of 5 stfu i'm sorry i'm sorry
exhausting hello cobalt by the way hello
cobalt welcome welcome
cobalt how many crayons do you think is
too many for a five-year-old to go to
kindergarten with would you say the
number is over or under 96.
if you had to pick a number out of thin
air
an adequate amount of crayons for a
five-year-old to take to school without
being you know ridiculous
would your number be over or under 120
anyway this was confusing for me as i
buy the items specifically for my
children i decided i was going through
with our supply shopping tradition as
normal never getting anything less than
what was required of course and send a
note with both of my boys that their
items would be their own and could be
kept in their backpacks as usual when i
expressed this sentiment to those around
me aside from my husband they weren't
very receptive to the idea am i the
[ __ ] for not following the rules
listed
it's just
why are you getting in your own way i
guess
it's just kind of weird i agree
i mean
as i'm straddling two lines here because
i'm
a parent but i've also been a teacher
and when you're like a teacher if you
have to manage a class of 35 year olds
i'm sure you devise the system that
makes it as convenient as possible so
you don't have to focus on minutia like
who's got the always the right crayon
box in their backpack you probably just
want to keep it on the damn shelf so
when it's arts and crafts time you can
just you know drag them all out and
nobody's gonna cry because they didn't
get the right box right instead you got
one dad who's like i know that you
designed this system but i think i know
how it should work better than that and
now is even more exhausting because you
got to deal with the dad as well so yeah
i think you're kind of the [ __ ]
honestly like why don't you just buy the
list like the teacher's job is already
hard you really think that they designed
the
school supply list to like antagonize
you
you think they don't have bigger
problems in their lives it's just a
this is kind of just like a a weird
battle to pick quite frankly
i just i don't understand
i mean like if you bought
more supplies than necessary and said
that the whole class can share them sure
i don't think they would say there's
anything wrong with that
if you buy more supplies than necessary
and say we're opting out of the communal
school supplies what are you doing
i don't understand
you got pre-red okay well let's check it
out i'm 100 open and now intend to buy
extra school supplies the same with each
of my children for those whose families
can't afford to purchase them my kiddos
also yeah okay so like i understand also
that maybe there was like a a a cap on
the school of supplies to not make
uh people with less money feel like they
have to overspend in order to keep up
with the joneses that makes a lot of
sense but also like why are you i don't
just i just don't understand why you're
picking the battle in the first place
like why don't you just adhere to the
the letter that they gave you because
it's kindergarten like who cares
it just doesn't make any sense to me
like why like do you have no problems in
your life
i get that this is four petty grievances
but at the same time like how did here's
what i want i want you to make a
follow-up post it's like how i got to be
35 years old with two kids and the
biggest thing going on in my life right
now is like i'm having a feud with a
kindergarten teacher over school
supplies
you haven't had simultaneous salmonella
and campylobacter infections recently
clearly you'd haven't done colonoscopy
prep recently
am i the [ __ ] for um helping my wife
take her father to the emergency room
and then rolling my eyes when he told me
that they said wait anywhere so he went
home and missed his appointment you know
like i feel like i got i'm just
wondering what's going on in your life
that this is taking up so much space
you're the [ __ ] for the reasons
others have mentioned 14 years in public
schools you don't want to start the year
being that parent you just don't most
classrooms i was in extra items were
simply sent home or not used
may i suggest you could set up a
homework a homework station at home with
some of the office items your kiddos
would like i know who
this parent is not really like i don't
know who they are but i
every class had three of this person
you know the kind of like kid that's
unreasonably organized for a 12 year old
i didn't realize that that carried
through into adulthood as well it was me
i was i was unreasonably messy as a 12
year old or i don't know maybe
reasonably messy honestly
omg he does i've been loving the daddy
pig photoshops by the way
there finally
it's a number two post so maybe it's not
finally from a teacher you're the
[ __ ] especially if items are going to
be shared you're trying to individualize
supplies for your kids it makes it
harder on the teacher when they have 25
plus more kids like yours to manage in
the classroom shared supplies also
create a sense of accountability what
you're doing is teaching your kids it's
okay to not follow directions following
directions is one of the biggest
problems with kids in school right now
yes good
bernie sanders.png yes
i couldn't like here it's the thing it
and i apologies i already talked about
the campylobacter the colonoscopy let's
bring it back to the crews it's the same
thing except with adults that we went
through we were disembarking from the
damn cruise ship there's 3 500 people
trying to get off of this damn you know
floating apartment building
one in 10 people was like i know that
they've designed the system to maximize
throughput but i was gonna [ __ ] around
and break the rules cause i think i know
better than the staff and that makes it
take longer not only for them but for
absolutely everybody that is behind them
in the line as well hey we only called
people with pluto luggage tags oh i'd
like to get off the boat what's your
luggage tag uh mickey mouse
uh well we only called pluto i don't
understand why i can't get off the boat
excuse to cut the the luggage is coming
off in a specific order so they let the
people go and then they can pick up
their luggage and then they got more
space with the luggage which will then
they can put out the new tags and then
every like it's actually faster for
everybody to just follow the system but
instead this guy's like oh the system's
not perfect for me yeah that's because
it's a compromise because you got 30
kids in your damn kindergarten classroom
you gotta
they did
you know how exhausted you are after
looking after like two kids all day okay
look after 25 strangers kids
in a big room where they're all running
around with each other for eight hours
for nine months a year and then oh it's
tuesday time to do finger painting
try to get 25 damn kids to wash their
hands oh uh
jeremy's dad sends him with the special
toms of maine soap
because he doesn't use dial they're not
a dial household okay like
honestly you have to live with other
people in society just get over it
like you're not that special
sorry to say
you're not that cool
like everybody's gotta wipe their ass
with the one ply toilet paper for 15
years okay
it's a shared trauma that allows us to
bond as generations
we could probably do one more
what the hell is this am i the [ __ ]
for not wanting a med school student to
watch my doctor perform a recto scope on
me can somebody tell me is a rectoscope
a real thing or is this a rare
colonoscopy post
you would know
this is my is my uh my alt account by
user slash deleted five days ago five
days ago
ah i'm safe no i'm not my colonoscopy
was six days ago
oh [ __ ]
i had opportunity what do i need now i
need motive and intent
holy cow this is like it's perfect
timing man
we got him
boys rectoscope
pardon me
long story short my doctor told me i
don't live in the u.s
i don't live in the u.s man
i don't remember making this post but
this doesn't seem like the kind of post
my wife would make
so it must be for me
long story short my doctor told me 29 m
ah
i'm 29 am
in many ways
that she will perform a rectoscope to
see if i really have hemorrhoids or
something else it was already
embarrassing to discuss my medical issue
in front of a bunch of medical students
and ask questions too i pro look it's
your prerogative it's your right i i
promise you that they do not care
every single one of these students is
going to watch like 12 people die
in their career they they don't care
about your butthole
they're probably just really tired like
they're probably just like man i hope
this guy stops being so weird about his
[ __ ] so we can get lunch on time
today so i don't have to eat a ham
sandwich over the bathroom garbage can
on the way to my next assignment
anyway i didn't mind it so much until
the next part
she got me into the exam room and with
her there was a student medical training
with her my doctor told me to get in the
position get my pants off and literally
show her my [ __ ] to insert the thing
i was like in front of her and she said
yes it threw me off because i never
expected this to happen i told her i'm
not going to do this until she gets out
of the room the student told me she's
just here to observe and ask questions
so she learns i told her that it's cute
what
nice try sweetheart i know you're just
trying to get a glance at his sweet
juicy peach i got here
cute excuse honey
where i come from we call this sexual
harassment
what is he that's cute
but i'm not going to do it in front of
her she needs to get out i got in a
small fight with the doctor and the
student both insisting it's okay for her
to be there and trying to convince me
but eventually the doctor gave up and
agreed after finishing my visit the
student confronted me and made me know
she didn't like the way i spoke to her
that seems totally fair
if you said it's cute
there's i spoke i spoke to her and that
there's no shame in medicine she's only
there for learning i told her off and
that i don't want her to see me naked
she called me an [ __ ] and left am i
the [ __ ] okay
um
this might surprise you i don't think
you're the [ __ ] for not wanting the
medical student to be in there i think
that's you're right as a patient
i
and you probably could guess this based
on the amount that i talked about this
but like
i'm open about my medical procedure
i mean if if they want to have the room
packed for the colonoscopy what do i
care
six people are seeing a camera be shoved
up my [ __ ] why not make it 20. why
not make it a hundred what do i care
but i think it's your right to be like
no only the doctor but the way he talked
about it was like
i was was very rude i think that makes
him an [ __ ]
edit i want to say that i went to a
medical school hospital not a normal
hospital this might be relevant okay
you're the [ __ ]
are you stupid are you is this the same
guy who made the he ate his girlfriend's
overnight oats
because he thought she didn't make them
and thus he must have
yeah that's that's dumb
if you go to like a barber
college you can't be mad that like a
student might want to watch you get your
hair cut it doesn't make any sense
like it's actually it is nonsensical
i retract my not the [ __ ] again oh
here's the thing i think you should have
the right to be like no the medical
student can't watch you shove a camera
up my butt
i'm not comfortable with that i'm
comfortable with that because at that
point i'm like i got bigger problems
like the camera going up my butt
i'm not going to let like a
a little speed bump screw up the whole
road trip right if you and you know what
maybe they'll become a better
gastroenterologist as a result
but the way he talked to the medical
student
seemed very rude which makes him an
[ __ ]
i'm finding it hard to believe that a
doctor wouldn't ask
and that any medical staff wouldn't take
obvious patient discomfort into a factor
and to so this is what's called the
straw man argument they've chosen uh the
weakest argument of someone that
disagrees with them and then they're
gonna argue against it in order to make
their own point seem stronger
i'm so sorry you found that unbelievable
but i unfortunately i can assure you it
did happen to me yesterday and it was
unbelievable to me too
i thought i was the [ __ ] because
maybe i prevented her a chance to learn
maybe i don't know
i mean i find it hard to believe as well
but simultaneously like
i also find it hard to believe that you
went to a
medical university hospital and then
we're like no medical students please
update thank you for the kind words
i know that this post is tagged as
[ __ ] but it seems most comments are
saying not the [ __ ] so don't worry i
know now that
we won we won big
j beasman
thank you for the gifted subscriptions
thank you thank you
it's looking like i'm not the [ __ ] as
far as i'm concerned i'm not the [ __ ]
i'm also gonna tell you i only went to
the hospital because my doctor works
there now and told me to go there for a
checkup every thursday
once a week
i also live in egypt sorry for not
answering these questions early i didn't
open my account until now i will also
try to report the student
forward
i lost my place i will also try to
report this student like many people
here are telling me to it will be a
disaster if somebody like this becomes a
doctor what the hell are you talking
about
you kind of like based on your own
verbiage in the post you kind of
verbally abused her
which means you in real life you were
probably way more rude than even your
post would make you seem to be
and she didn't say hey i really want to
see your butthole she said hey i didn't
like the way you talked to me which is
completely valid
oh my god
literal they're just i mean
i'm sorry
they're just looking at your butt why
are you being so weird it doesn't make
you any less of a man again i think he's
within his rights to say i only want the
doctor to be in the room i just don't
know why he's making it such a big deal
that like he was a he was being kind of
a [ __ ] about it and then the
student was like you're being a [ __ ]
and then he's like i'm about to ruin
this girl's whole career
also
the post says [ __ ] but he's like
thank you for telling me i'm not the
[ __ ]
uh you're the [ __ ] because of your
edit
everybody sucks here
in light of the edit
not the [ __ ] okay well i'm not gonna
read this because it makes my point
weaker
med student here not the [ __ ] trader
not the [ __ ] edit everybody sucks
here edit not the [ __ ]
i don't respect the flip-flopper
all right
anyway
he better never go to talladaga
absolutely true
am i the [ __ ] for suing the talladega
audience for constantly yelling show me
your butthole
we got scatty we got beer
we're getting [ __ ] nuts



all right check this out last time we
did react court we realized that every
single post was horrible um they were
all creative writing exercises and every
single one is like first paragraph i'm
the [ __ ] second paragraph oh my god
am i the [ __ ] third paragraph uh
horrible
medical or psychological trauma that
completely justifies the insane actions
that they took in the first two
paragraphs and you get and you don't
even feel good reading it because you're
like i feel bad and this is fake so
now
i'm on the real am i the [ __ ]
subreddit i'm not on the filtered one
which is like the best writing prompts
that 11th graders made when they should
have been doing their calculus homework
unfortunately
calculus is no longer look we're not
going to get into that we could talk
about the education system later now
we're on am i the [ __ ] and i'm
sorting by
[ __ ] like top
this week
only with the [ __ ] flare because if
you're not the [ __ ] i don't really
care
i've realized also i realized that am i
the [ __ ] subreddit is designed badly
and i don't mean that to be rude but
it's not designed for what i want
because when you sort by like top posts
the top posts are
the people who are not the [ __ ]
because they get more upvotes because
people are like sympathetic
the
people who are the [ __ ] get down
voted to oblivion because they're
[ __ ]
and as a result they don't get sorted to
the top
that's not what i want to see on this
subreddit the top posts are all like am
i the [ __ ] for uh you know my husband
67 m and me 19f uh he yelled at me at
dinner
and called me a racial slur and then
that's like 50 000 upvotes you don't
need that
i don't i know who the [ __ ] is there
you can't get any kind of
you know banter there
you need something like this you need
i'm sorting by spicy
i don't like sorting by controversial
though because like controversial my
limited experience with sorting by
controversial
on reddit is that
you just get the highly downvoted
comments to the top which usually ends
up giving you like you know
horrible stuff like people who are like
just constantly talking about um vaccine
mandates
downvoted to like minus 70 even though
the post has nothing to do with vaccines
in the first place so like that's i'd
rather those comments stay near the
bottom
if possible
i love those people that's fine
me too in like a human we're all in this
same boat together sort of way
like in a love your fellow man sort of
way absolutely
anyway this first one i mean we sorted
by spicy take a look we found our unique
spicy formula
am i the [ __ ] for making my daughter
give up her dog that's that's a pretty
spicy title throw away because a few of
my family members browser at it and i
would rather the situation stay
contained
my m45 daughter f-16 has a dog she
bought a couple months ago her mother
and i said she could get one as long as
she took care of him paid for everything
he needed and spent time with him okay
like this is already like
i don't want to say is not okay
her his daughter's a fighter pilot a
fighter jet
his daughter is a damn f-16 hornet
i don't know if it's a hornet all i know
is the sr-71 is the blackbird
i feel like and maybe this is
like perfect world situation okay
i feel like you can get like your
eight-year-old or your 10 year old or
your 12 year old a dog
when you're buying your 16 year old or
you're allowing your 16 year old
daughter to get a dog
that's your dog
there's a lot of upheaval in a young
person's life from
16 to like 25. you're moving a lot you
might go to college you might spend a
year abroad like
you you you might spend 10 years abroad
so like that's your pet
that's
this already is like
that i'm not saying that dad should have
disallowed it i'm simply saying
he should at least recognize that like
in forward-looking context
it's his dog which is fine you know
isn't that the way it always works as a
grumpy guy maybe played by a jack
nicholson type i hate dogs i hate dogs
then all of a sudden he gets saddled
with a dog maybe it's a dog of someone
played by maybe greg kinnear or
something like that and then he's like
oh i'm so grumpy i hate this animal but
then he bonds with the animal and he's
like actually i love dogs like that's
the way it's supposed to go
anyway she held up her end of the
bargain for a while everything was
working out the way it was supposed to
she potty trained him took him on plenty
of walks paid for his vet bills and food
the whole nine yards oh that's the other
thing
dogs kind of expensive i mean pets are
expensive in general
it seems unrealistic to ask your 16 year
old to pay for every
expense for the dog
like not just
apparently purchasing the dog in the
first place but then also the vet bills
and like the food and the
like
you could have like a part-time job just
to
pay for the dog especially the vet
no wonder she doesn't have time for the
dog she's gotta she's driving for uber
eats man
she works 20 oh there you go okay
however after a couple of months she got
busier at school and work she's a
sophomore in high school and works part
time at a fast food chain she works 25
to 30 hours a week and spends at least
two hours on homework every night holy
cow man
i gotta be honest this girl's busier
than i am that's like
that's almost a full work week plus
school plus two hours of homework a
night my god
it's she's busy
even though her dog never went in the
house and seemed okay i felt bad for him
since she wasn't home as much as she she
used to be unfortunately there's
absolutely nothing that you could do to
rectify the situation
i talked to her at first telling her
that he needed more attention i was like
i'm the dad is 45 i get he's probably
busy he's a busy time in a person's life
i do love that he like he sees a a sad
dog
and he's like well there's absolutely
nothing i could do to rectify the
situation
15-minute walk play play with the dog a
little bit no
it's not my dog it's my house my rules
we signed the contract it's like my 16
year old doesn't know anything about
tort law
i've raised countless dogs in my life
and i know what is needed for a healthy
obedient dog i'm just unwilling to even
put in the slightest effort for that
right now i was also worried she
wouldn't be his alpha which is
absolutely necessary if she expected to
take him with her when she moved out i
don't know what that means
can somebody
can a dog pills pet cell explain to me
what
your dog being someone's alpha is
it's a myth yeah but like what's the
myth
it's
it's an old-fashioned thing that
i mean i know what an alpha dog is i've
seen the movie with emil hersh and
justin timberlake and ben foster
but
like
the dog needs to be seen as the pack
leader
but like how can he be the alpha to his
owner
like he's not pouring his own food into
the bowl i don't
i don't understand
that's the other way oh he's worried the
dog won't respect his daughter
okay
you know i not to be uh the guy who saw
james aka a caster specials and then
referenced them but it reminds me of
that james a caster bit
where he's like i was at the club do you
guys know what negging is it's when you
uh
subtly insult someone to undermine your
self-esteem and get them interested in
you and i don't want to brag but
these girls were nagging me all night
the old reddit switcheroo
plus two don't plus two me you just
watch the specials they're they're good
okay anyway things got better for a bit
until the summer came and they were
giving her more hours at work enough was
enough and i put my foot down insisting
she give him up since she couldn't be
bothered to make more time for him she
argued with me for a long time about it
eventually giving in and finding him a
new owner she goes straight to her room
after work and refuses to talk to me my
wife is upset but hasn't really picked
the side
so am i the [ __ ] for making my
daughter give her dog a new home edit 30
hours of work a week is not that much
especially in the summer i'm rich look
she's 16 years old man like
sorry you you can't see the the post i
apologize
i mean
it's like yes and no
like 30 hours a week is not
that much but it's a lot for a
sophomore in high school
when probably like
i don't know 75 percent of her friends
have like
just
two or three months off for summer
vacation like that's pretty
it's pretty serious i'm not gonna
pretend like there's
look i had the easiest job in the world
before we had the baby you know maybe
like six seven years ago i could work 60
hours a week i'm recording isaac
episodes you know it's not hard
i'm not going to act like 30 hours a
week is not a lot though when you're
slinging like a hot chicken sandwiches
out of the damn grill and you're when i
was 16 i didn't even get
uh my first job until i was 17 i worked
10 hours a week i had two shifts a week
like this is all 30 hours is a lot man
even when i had summer jobs in
university i only worked
35 hours a week
i was like 1920
not in 1920. i know you're gonna think
it was 1920 because i'm bald but like i
was 19 to 20 years old
but
even still that i was like you know
exhausted on friday
anyway i'm raising my daughter to be a
responsible adult she pays for the
things she wants and needs and if she
needs help with money i provide it for
it's the summer she isn't in school she
has no excuse not to spend more time
with him edit too the dog was allowed in
the house i was saying it never went to
the bathroom in the house i did not
abuse the dog and i do not neglect my
daughter i am teaching her to be a
responsible adult
okay i believe that he believes that
he's teaching his daughter to be a
responsible adult at the same time i
think he also well i mean just to be
honest i don't use this word lightly and
also i'm not a psychologist or a
psychiatrist but it seems like you
traumatized your daughter
by being like a hard-line boomer about
the idea that like she went back on her
word very slightly for
justifiable reasons because she got
insanely busy
as a 16 year old kid you know who's in
the damn 10th grade
like there's
this is a very common recurring element
in uh
am i the [ __ ] and i apologize i don't
want to be sexist but it's to my own
gender so i can do it
so a lot of am i the [ __ ] posts that
are like
25 to 65 year old men who are like well
i under i understand the situation
changed in a way that's completely
understandable and was not predictable
in the first place but we had a deal and
uh the mail code means that we shook on
it so we have like a rigid set of
standards we've already agreed to and if
we don't adhere to it i'm sorry but you
got to give up your best friend like
it's
there's no
and and it's not an all men thing but
like some people just in general have no
ability to compromise or to realize that
like a deal that you made in january
might not make as much sense in august
when this when the world is changed but
anyway
let's let's see don't downvote [ __ ]
okay i'm gonna say that that's a mission
failed from reddit here
you're the [ __ ] you can't have it
both ways making her take full
responsibility for the dog then forcing
her to get rid of him it's her dog or
it's not and from your own admission it
doesn't sound
i like this post
because
they used his own objectivism against
him
if it's her dog how can he make her give
it up you can't have your cake and eat
it too
that's her dog from now on
you can't get create like a
states rights situation and then also
put a federal law on top of it when you
don't like what the state does
as intellectually inconsistent
you gotta adhere to the terms of your
own deal
the alpha stuff is also nonsense okay
that's chad told me that as well she's
gonna resent you forever for this yeah
okay
absolutely true
in my opinion
what the hell is am i the cloaca by the
way
am i the [ __ ] am i the [ __ ]
filtered am i the butt face am i the
cloaka
i'm not gonna have a look on camera like
i know what it is anatomically speaking
i just don't know what it is
[Laughter]
with in the reddit context
you're the [ __ ] a teenager who's in
school full time and working 25 to 30
hours a week part-time does not have the
bandwidth to care for an animal
like i'm just
let's
look at it mathematically
so school
is
let's say
eight to two
five days a week
but also
i mean it's not really eight to two
because you gotta get up at 6 15 to take
a shower to then
uh get on the bus
to and then you get on the bus at the
way on the way home and
it's another hour and then you got two
hours of homework tonight so she's
probably like realistically
you know she's on the clock from like
seven until
five so it's ten hours it says 50 hours
a week of school if you factor in the
homework and the travel as well
plus
30 to 35 hours a week
of work
i mean
she's at like
like a 75 80 hour work week man there's
it's getting a little crazy
and i'm like running the numbers what
there's 168 hours in a week or something
like that
so half of that has already gone to
school and work a third of of the total
is gone
due to sleep realistically and then
you're like well she's only got like
what eight minutes a week to take care
of the the damn dog
and she's 16 years old it's madness man
this is the american dream
okay anyway i think this one is just i i
like starting with a cut and dry one
like this it makes it a little easier
you know
usually we save the controversy for like
you know
50 minutes in
okay and then like even the sorting is
not right man it's like why is reddit so
bad top post of the week 2.4 000 upvotes
second most popular post
19 upvotes third most popular post 330
of votes here we go
i i only want to see ones like 450 plus
okay am i the [ __ ] for demanding my
fiancee stop teaching our kids bad
manners
probably i mean i want to say no but
demanding is a very strong word so i'm
not totally sure
um hi everyone using a throwaway yeah we
know okay this subreddit has been around
for like 10 years
it's not uh
you
everybody expects you to use a throwaway
at this point nobody expects you to tie
it to your default identity like in meat
space that's crazy
my fiance lola and i have been together
for five years engaged for a little over
a year and we have twins our wedding is
in two months
lola usually takes care of feeding the
kids in the morning since i work early
so i never noticed this until recently i
took a week vacation from work just to
spend time at home with my kids
and lola and started to notice something
that bothered me
lola has been teaching our kids bad
table manners and sees nothing wrong
with it i hadn't noticed as they don't
eat this type of food for lunch dinner
or snacks or eat it all the time so i
guess i missed it okay so here's that
it's a good preamble
what
constitutes bad table manners i think
there's a lot first off your kids are
two and a half which is good like
you got bigger fish to fry i think
i think here's
bad bad table manners picking your nose
at the table
chewing with your mouth open or like
making a lot of noise when you when
you're chewing deliberately basically
some people get a little crazy and
they're like i i honestly i can't fathom
how small the problems in your life
would have to be to be worried about
having your elbows on the table
i don't understand
why that's a thing
but can i tell you by the way one of the
reasons i never joined the school band
in high school is like in ninth grade
i went on a
one day like music retreat where we went
to like a campsite
and played a concert at like a nursing
home and a concert at the campsite okay
we ate dinner at the campsite i'm in the
ninth grade everybody else more or less
that's there
was uh they were already part of the
school band i'm eating i'm enjoying the
company of my friends i have my elbows
on the table
everybody simultaneously breaks into
like i forget the the way that it starts
but it's like
something ryan ryan if you're able get
your elbows off the table this is not a
a
livestock table this is it's a first
class dining table
walk your butt walk walk your butt
walk and then i was like what does that
mean
and then they're like oh you have to get
up in front of everybody and spell your
name out with your ass
like you have to go to the front of the
room and then spell your name like
facing the opposite direction by moving
your butt
and i was like everybody was having a
great time and i was like are you crazy
i'm not giving up nights and weekends
for this [ __ ] this is the most psychotic
thing i've ever been a part of in my
whole life
it was it was like the start of
mid-summer man
i was clearly in a different like
a different culture and i was fully
immersed in it without having any sort
of orientation whatsoever
anyway so that's why i never joined the
band
one of the one of the reasons regardless
this morning i was helping make lola
breakfast i was helping lola make
breakfast and then i got the kids ready
well she brought their food out for them
as they were getting ready to eat i
noticed they didn't have forks or spoons
so i told lola i would get them she said
there's no need okay
lots of foods you eat with your hands
i watched instead and she gave the kids
tortillas that she ripped into pieces
they were using their bare hands to grab
the food using pieces of the tortilla i
asked her what she was doing we should
be giving them utensils but she seemed
shocked that i was concerned and said
that's how they always eat it
yeah
i
i don't even want to stop reading
because i don't understand
what's wrong with it
how are you supposed to use a fork
or like a spoon
or a combination to use a tortilla
i guess
you could but like why
like could you cut a piece off the
tortilla
use the knife to put some filling on top
of it and then eat it yeah but why
i don't understand
it's just i mean i don't
it just seems like a tortilla is the
wrong hill to die on here this is a very
hand-based food
i told her she was teaching them bad
manners and making them think it was
okay to just grab food with their hands
she told me they do that anyway when
they have chips or grapes or tacos or
pizza and listed a bunch of other snacks
and fast food you eat without utensils
okay so my wife owned me am i the
[ __ ]
when i complained about something
idiotic my wife brought up 17 examples
of foods we eat all the time that i
don't have a problem with but those hey
those foods though are american
like a burger dude a burger you want me
to use a fork and a knife to grab a
burger are you crazy
it's a burger a taco yeah that's fork
and knife man
you don't want to touch the tortilla
with your bare hands
i pointed out those things are usually
made to be eaten quickly or on the road
so utensils aren't needed
i this is just an insane goal post move
to me she said i was being offensive by
calling her way of eating gross and
saying it was bad manners but i do think
it's gross to see someone grabbing at
food with their bare hands like that on
the other hand uh eating a hamburger
while driving even though you're still
touching the food with your hands not
gross even though you probably haven't
washed your your hands in two hours no
big deal
is only gross when you do it at home
right after you've washed your hands in
your bathroom sink
she said she grew up eating like that
and would always use tortillas to eat
things like eggs or meat bean meat rice
beans and that it wasn't gross because
she always made the kids wash their
hands i ended up giving my kids forks
for them to eat okay healthiest
relationship spotted
they didn't want to use which made me
even more frustrated with her because
now they're used to this
lola has been really annoyed the rest of
the day and wouldn't let me help with
lunch and earlier she was walking around
the house speaking to someone probably
her sister in spanish about me and i'm
starting to feel a bit annoyed
it's so good man
he doesn't speak spanish because then he
would probably know who she's talking to
but she's talking about him you i can
relate to that
usually it's not uh
bad stuff but sometimes i'll be like you
know looking at my phone while i'm
eating dinner with my in-laws because i
mean like i'm on year 10 of this stuff
right like
some point you just gotta tap out and
and do the doom scroll and i'll hear
like korean speaking and then ryan and
then korean speaking and then ryan and
then i'm like but then i know i can pick
up enough korean that i can usually
figure out what she's talking about and
then
i like i laugh when the punchline comes
in at least
i don't pretend to know the whole thing
but i i'm like i get the gist of it
wow lots of replies quickly they seem to
be mixed so far but i will add the kids
can use utensils and use them on foods
like soups pastas etc what is it
it's not like even that the kids are
young so they have to use their hands i
mean i have a two-year-old essentially
she's not quite two but she's close
enough
but like
she uses her hands to eat
pasta sometimes because she's young but
at the same time i recognize that
ideally in the future she'll use
a fork
or a spoon you know she'll use
appropriate utensils just so her hands
and face don't get so messy
but like
the this is a food that's designed for
hand-based
consumption
like the only thing you gain out of
using
a fork and a knife or a spoon to do it
is that
you've got more dishes and it's probably
going to take you longer to eat like
it's just it's just bad
it's not a sensible uh
opinion to have
yeah i think you know this is a good
point the tortilla is the utensil
it's basically like uh
it's a corn glove
well maybe that's not the maybe glove is
not the way you think of it but
all the dude's replies are super racist
by the way okay well let's go take a
look at that then um so yeah you're the
[ __ ]
he's probably heavily downvoted if i had
to guess so we probably won't even see
them
you're the [ __ ] it's very common to
use a tortilla as the utensil you're
being insensitive to her culture not
just insensitive but like
i don't know like
it just doesn't make any sense
i fundamentally i'm mostly just like
you're the [ __ ] and i'm confused why
you want your kids to use a fork to eat
something with a tortilla it doesn't
it doesn't make any sense
like i've i've actually fully don't
understand
i think he's just mad and he's trying to
find a source for his madness but
actually he's just mad
i think he has some built up resentment
and it bubbled to the surface at the the
most frictionless
possible moment which was this where he
felt like he had a leg to stand on but
actually doesn't you're the [ __ ] yes
okay absolutely sure
i'm kind of sad you have kids yet you
know so little about them and how they
develop
they are not ten but two all
two-year-olds eat with their hands
hold on that didn't scroll down enough
for you
also like there's like a simple rule of
parenting i think
if you got like a good routine with your
kids or if what if your spouse has a
good routine with the kids why [ __ ] it
up
like it's already
i'm not saying it's the hardest job in
the world but it's like it's hard enough
probably took like months to get to the
point you got a stable eating routine
and you're like hey let me let me get in
here and
cause some problems for no reason
show his replies i don't want to
validate him also i don't know how to do
that that's the main reason
you're the [ __ ] this is how
two-year-olds eat you don't need a fork
for a tortilla very true
it's at the top of the comment section
elsa voice i can hear you but i won't
it is i it's just i don't want to click
on his replies and have him had like a
racial slur pop up or something like
that i'll let the down votes hide it so
that i already know i don't like the guy
i don't need to you ever hear the
expression two's better to appear a fool
than to open one's mouth and remove all
doubt
that's kind of where i'm at with this
guy except replace fool with i don't
know
possibly i don't know bad person
you're the [ __ ] your casual racism
towards your wife is going to affect
your kids yeah i mean okay
i'm i understand why everybody's calling
him a little racist however
i wish more people would also focus on
the fact that his argument just doesn't
make sense to begin with
i understand why the racism thing is is
bubble into the surface
but i wish more people would talk about
how it doesn't make sense to eat a
tortilla with a with a fork and a knife
to begin with
maybe he's a germaphobe
yeah but he said he doesn't mind eating
fast food in his car
am i the [ __ ] for telling my
girlfriend to stop meal planning oh no
that is edit at the top man
this though the whole post is just edits
there's an edit at the top there's
three edits at the bottom and the whole
thing is only two paragraphs no this is
a new one this is this i swear to you
this is a new one it's posted two days
ago
we had we did have one similar but that
was i believe that was the boyfriend was
mad because it took
five minutes to plan their meals for the
week but he's not the kind of person on
a sunday who knows what he wants to eat
on a thursday because mommy's special
little boy gets to pick at 5 45 what
he's gonna eat at six every day of the
week even though he's 28 years old i
remember that one that one
still lives in my brain
that's like somehow you got to be an
adult but you're like my day is ruined
if i don't get to choose what to eat for
dinner on the exact like time of dinner
every day
oh man sorry i had to let the blood
pressure come down a little bit
what about the classic i let my stepson
almost die
so that he could learn his lesson yes
the most sensible um home gin home gym
owner
who let his uh stepson think that he was
going to die
because he didn't want his stepson using
his gym
see that's what could happen to you if
you use the gym without my supervision
that's also what could happen to you if
you use the gym with my supervision as
demonstrated by my behavior right now
the other one do there there's been a
lot of classics like uh
the the i borrowed three daughters or
three daughters three dollars from my
sister to order pizza and then paid her
back before she got home and she won't
talk to me anymore
and i'm like it's three dollars or they
paid it back but then the
some people were like it's the principal
that's my property
explain the pizza one they needed uh
they needed three dollars to tip the
pizza delivery guy
nobody had any cash except there was a
little cash in his sister's room so he
took the three dollars from his sister's
room
then paid her back the next day and she
was like
pissed
she would not talk to him because it was
a violation of like her privacy for him
to take the three bucks
okay
turkish santa vs greek santa was also
good
anyway all right am i the [ __ ] for
telling my girlfriend to stop meal
planning we'll start with the edit edit
please stop commenting that my
girlfriend has an eating disorder she
does not if you do it i will probably
block you
but i'm not a hundred percent confident
that depends on the contents of your
message
i don't care if you've had an eating
disorder
this is one situation it's not possible
to say someone has an eating disorder
over one situation you weren't even
there to witness my dumb assery sent her
to a high-intensity practice with no
food in her body i don't know what is
going on
is written like a johnny truant passage
from house of leaves like what's
happening
it's we're starting at the damn end
that's not cool and i'm sure all of you
would be upset as well
she is not rigid with her food she
doesn't have time to cook so meal
prepping makes sure she can eat to meet
her caloric goals and nutritional needs
to stay healthy
her team meets with a dietitian to make
sure they're eating the calories they
need to well then why are you telling
her to stop
meal prepping i don't understand
she needs to meal prep to get her
nutritional needs but the title is am i
the iso for getting there to stop meal
prepping
i know it sounds bad but hear me out my
girlfriend charlotte is really big into
fitness she always played sports as a
kid and is now playing volleyball in
college she also goes to the gym six
days a week because of this she likes to
meal prep
[Laughter]
for the week to make sure she gets her
macros i don't know if you've heard
about this stuff
just a couple hours ago she went into
the fridge and suddenly became very
frantic because i'd eaten her overnight
oats
i think that's what they are called i
didn't realize they were part of her
meal prep i thought the oatmeal
fairy just blessed us and put some food
in the fridge that was for me to eat
without asking for it
i thought just some benevolent donator
came by and put some food in the fridge
that was for me because i live here
so blessed
lebron james uh instagram photo can't
believe this my life
i didn't realize they were a part of her
meal prep because she'd never made them
before and didn't say anything
what was she thinking usually her meal
preps are several of the same meal but
there was only one oatmeal container so
i thought it was in hers
but like
okay
i think i'm missing some context whose
was it that do you have like roommates
if it's not hers then who's would it be
if you didn't make it
like you didn't make it
so it's not yours either
i don't understand
can you just admit like what instead of
writing this insane sentence that falls
apart under the slightest bit of
scrutiny why not just be like i'm an
adult
i made a mistake and ate her food cause
it looked good and it was a moment of
weakness or whatever
that doesn't make you a bad person it
happens
i don't understand why you like
like trying to come up with some form of
justification that's like oh normally
when she makes food there's a lot of it
but there wasn't that much here so i
just ate it even though i didn't make it
it doesn't it just doesn't make any
sense i'm trying to put myself in this
guy's
in this guy's shoes
like it's not ingredients it's food
it's not like there was some
strawberries in the fridge and he ate a
couple like this is like a meal
you ate a meal out of the fridge
this is the guy that is in your office
so they had to make those bags that have
like a mold pattern on them
so that it looks like it's a moldy
sandwich but actually the sandwich
inside is good you just had to put some
form of deterrence on it so that people
didn't steal it from you
maybe he thought he made it and forgot
maybe that that's the only thing hey did
i make these overnight outs i don't know
maybe it doesn't seem like a thing that
my fiance would do or my girlfriend so
yeah it was probably me even though i
have no memory of doing it that just
doesn't seem like something she would do
this is crazy
she went off about how inconsiderate i
was being because she didn't have time
to cook in the morning because of her
schedule that seems completely fair i
immediately apologize for eating it even
though clearly based on this post he
doesn't really see that that he did that
much wrong i mean you think he knows
that he did it wrong but he's like hey
there's justification for it
have you considered that the container
was not as big as the normal meal prep
containers you make and thus i didn't
think it was for you i thought it was
for anybody it was a first come first
serve situation
i know that it was super crappy and i
genuinely had no idea
i just want to i just want to
talk to him for a second
and be like what do you mean you had no
idea
it how did you think the food got in the
fridge
i don't understand
i'm much like the last this is the last
post but like on steroids where i'm like
i didn't understand why that guy wanted
to use a fork to eat a tortilla this one
i'm like i just don't understand
it doesn't make any sense
after apologizing i said maybe she
should stop meal prepping if not getting
one of her meals throws her off that
much
this is
i'm sorry to say this is rude
this is some of the dumbest [ __ ] i've
ever read in my life
do you apply this to anything oh if you
need
insulin so bad maybe you should stop
taking it
it doesn't make any sense
maybe you should stop meal prepping if
uh me stealing your food makes it so you
can't eat your meal
she got angry and said that i wouldn't
understand since i don't play a sport
here's the thing i don't think it has
anything to do with a sport but i do
think that she's right that he wouldn't
understand based on
the reasoning skills that were on
display throughout the rest of the post
then she left she usually usually texts
me when she gets to her location safely
but hasn't said anything since our
argument am i the [ __ ]
she just texted me she wants to talk
after practice she just got home from
practice and we talked she apologized at
snapping at me over an accident but like
it's like
she's not in the wrong like at all you
should always try to be nice to people
but like
but she didn't
she didn't do anything wrong it's not an
accident
i mean i'm not naive enough to think
that like you could never eat someone's
food that they wanted to eat
you know
you get hungry you're tired you're like
uh you know maybe she forgot about it or
something like that i'm not saying
there's any good reasons but like you
and you should just ask in the first
place but then to like be offended that
you got called out
and thus go
maybe you should stop meal prepping if
you need food so bad like she
he should apologize
she just got pissed in the heat of the
moment but asked me not to touch any of
her meal prep food without asking
especially before practice because her
foods are important to keeping her
physically fit and her energy high yeah
no [ __ ]
like
i don't know what to say
like why is he typing this like
everybody reading this has to know this
right
she said that not keeping to her
nutritional goals can cause potential
injuries she said if i want the food she
preps i need to ask her to make some
make me some while she's prepping on
sundays i feel like i should include
this in my post because many people
don't read all the comments yes i
apologize profusely i ordered pink
lidded containers on amazon to make sure
this doesn't happen again
you just it doesn't are you what are you
talking about
you don't need a new system
if you didn't make the food
you know it's not for you to eat without
asking at least like
what's wrong you know the system didn't
fail you
you just ate someone else's food
i don't understand what why is this a
debate
i'm not even look
i get why you're focusing on the the
pink stuff okay
i'm just saying like it much like the
last one i'm like the the central
problem here is so insane to me that i
just don't get it if you didn't make the
food you don't need a special container
can't you look into your memory and be
like did i make this paella
if you didn't make the paella then don't
eat the paella
also the man's eating like overnight
oats at night
they're called overnight oats
and that's only like a minor slice of
the problem but
anyway we're both laughing over it now
she started calling me the oatmeal
bandit i love her she's so crazy you're
insane this is the most insane post i've
ever read
on on am i the [ __ ]
you you stole her food tried to gaslight
the internet into thinking that there
was any plausible reason to do it
it doesn't it not only it makes you a
bad person necessarily it's just
it doesn't make any sense
he must be so hot
of course you're the [ __ ]
you knew for sure you hadn't prepared it
and it wasn't yours
instead of saying my bad your solution
is to tell her to stop meal prepping
what
just don't eat things you didn't cook
holy cow it's like
literally
what i took 3 000 words to say in like
50 words
then they go too far and they say other
things about how we would steal stuff
from the work fridge i'm not comfortable
saying that again but
you're the [ __ ] i thought it wasn't
hers did you make it then whose did you
think it was if not hers it's so good
i love it
you're the [ __ ] did you think the oat
fairy prep the overnight oats okay i'm
learning i'm not as clever as i thought
i was
er i'm glad that for once everybody is
like baffled by the fact that this guy
is trying to argue like he didn't know
it was hers so he thought it was his
info how is the solution for this to
stop meal prepping and not for you to
just ask before you eat something
usually info is like how old is the
poster this one is lit this the info is
an own
you're the [ __ ]
you knew it wasn't yours i'd say the
reasonable next step is to ask her to
label her meals but asking her to stop
entirely why i don't i mean labeling the
meals i think is even too far but like
like they're implicitly labeled because
he didn't make them
i don't underst i just don't get it
the label is you didn't make that [ __ ]
that's the label
there was only one oatmeal i i will read
25 of these
there's one oatmeal container so i
thought it wasn't hers what the [ __ ] you
knew it wasn't yours
you're the [ __ ]
maybe a ghost left it there
i love this man
usually your meal preps are several of
the same meal but there was only one
container so i thought it wasn't hers um
whose food did you think you ate and
left without a meal instead and why
would that have been okay
oh man
that's fun
i'm not saying bullying is fun but i'm
not bullying i'm simply asking this
person questions
to figure out how
stupid they are
i'm simply using the socratic method
to
to figure out how stupid they are
it's called a debate
i don't even i i love the mother-in-law
post the the start of this is
unparsable it's incompete



am i the [ __ ] for telling my friend
that i think his girlfriend is about to
leave him
not 16 years old by the way

some consistency
30 f f30

and the sex in the same order every time
sorry i gotta hide i'm stumbling too
early
and my truck f150 i'm gonna plus two
that one chad that was a good one plus
two to you
we met at uni and we're part of the same
group of friends they got together in
our final year after uni tom and i
started work
ruby did masters while working
jason odin died what the hell is going
on the coolest dream
after masters ruby landed a very good
job and tom decided to quit his
apparently she wasn't happy but let it
go
ruby and i were very best friends
but after graduation she became boring
while me and tom would have a drink or
two in their garden she would study or
work and drift it apart that's so good
recently ruby has become more distanced
when i come over and tom and i sit in
the garden she doesn't even join us she
does her own stuff she barely
acknowledges us well tom doesn't see an
issue i tried to tell him but he said
it's fine at least she doesn't bother
him while gaming anymore she's lost a
lot of weight lately she's gained it
because of her thyroid and has just been
focusing on herself i tried inviting her
to have a drink with us but she always
refuses frankly i think she's taking
adulting way too seriously
psychic damage psychic damage

friends and we were doing a pub crawl at
one i noticed ruby having a drink with
her friends i didn't know she had any
and she was her old self laughing having
fun cracking jokes she was the life of
the party i didn't know any of those
people and i suspected tom didn't either
i texted tom and he said he's busy with
the game and we'll talk later
i couldn't let it go she went outside
with her friend and i followed them it
was crowded so she didn't notice me and
i kind of eavesdropped on them i was
lucky because of their because they're
talking about her plans and it seems
she's planning on leaving tom she's sick
of him not working and ignoring her but
been stuck because he doesn't work she
saved money for herself and saved a few
months money for him so when she leaves
he can have money to live off i couldn't
believe my ears what a b
tch
let me scroll down just a little bit
here
she said
she's got her ticket and house sorted
but she saw me before saying more she
looked at me with disgust didn't even
acknowledge me and she switched to
another language with her friend
oh man
i'm let's read the whole post let's not
get stun locked immediately i got a taxi
and went straight to tom's telling him
what i hear he told me to stop being
silly plus i'm playing a game we'll talk
later i told him he should consider what
to do so she stays and he said she has
no reason to leave we played some games
that got a bit more drunk
i stayed on their sofa and didn't know
when ruby came home i was woken up by
ruby at 2pm and she called me an [ __ ]
amongst other names kicked me out of the
house telling me to never come again she
was pissed because tom confronted her
about leaving she told me not to meddle
and i told her he has a right to know if
she's going to leave and has a chance to
make things right
was i really in the wrong for telling
him i mean we used to be
friends but i don't think i have any
obligation to her but i am not sure am i
really the [ __ ] for warning him i
thought he deserved that update [ __ ] has
hit the fun last night tom knocked on my
door crying she kicked him out they were
talking and he was beginning he was
begging for her to stay he offered to
find a part-time job and do more around
the house
but she wouldn't listen to him and
didn't care that he wanted to try okay
i know i said i wasn't going to get stun
locked
your girlfriend works provides all the
finances for the home
and there's
it's not gonna be a popular statement
okay
but there's more for you to do around
the house
you got 40 hours a week chilling
and then also the evenings
and there's still stuff you're not doing
like everything around the house or like
85 percent
you know i say you don't know how lucky
you got it
during eight hours of work if you did
like
two hours of chores daily that place
would be [ __ ]
sparkling
it can unless you live in a palatial
manner or something like that but like
you know look you do the dishes
maybe you vacuum once every two days
clean the bathrooms like once a week
do some laundry what else you [ __ ]
gotta do
he's on rumble versus a hundred percent
there's no doubt he's he's probably the
guy
javelin tackling me in the final circle
vacuum every two days i'm just saying
you got to justify your role
like you don't you don't have to vacuum
every two days but
if your partner is out there grinding
you should at least you know
i mean
keep up appearances right
like here's what i would do
if i was in this situation first off
there's no doubt the house would be
clean as hell every day
but
100 of the time
whenever it like if she comes home at
like 5 30
5 25 i'm plugging in the vacuum cleaner
so that when i open the door
she always sees me do
doing something
so she gets the subconscious impression
that like oh he's been working all day
he couldn't even finish the housework
by the time i got home
or i'd be like
i would just open the door wearing like
rubber gloves and be like oh sorry i
just finished cleaning the bathroom or
something like that meanwhile i would
you know have a leisurely breakfast to
probably go for a nice walk play some
pokemon go come back eat a leisurely
lunch and then i would do some chores
and then i would probably like watch a
movie or something like that and then i
would plug in the vacuum at 5 25 and be
like
anyway
and then if she people are like well
what if she came home early one day i
would just as if she came home before 5
30 and i was looking like i was just
gaming i would be like
i'm sick
i don't feel well
you can only pull that card like once
every few years though so you gotta most
of the time you gotta be on the on the
ball
but you can't if the if your
girlfriend's making all the money for
the house you can't let the home be in
disarray
because then your girlfriend is just
your mom
like you're supposed to be equals in the
relationship you're in in theory you're
supposed to be making an effort to put
in you know equal effort
if she's doing all the breadwinning and
50 of the housework you gotta you're
like stop being such a loser
i'm sorry i didn't know
how else to phrase it
you should do a hundred but you should
at least do like 85 or something like
that
like what are you doing
sorry sorry
now if the rolls were reversed i would
say she's girl bossing leave her alone
but i i can put myself in his shoes more
easily okay
she said she's leaving in two weeks
she's she's so serious about adulting
she gave two weeks notice to her
boyfriend he asked where if they could
meet and work on things while living
separately but she's moving abroad
she asked him to go and stay someplace
else while she's packing
she's packing
everybody get down she's got a gun
and he can move back in once she leaves
she told him she had money saved up for
him so he'll have time to find job
he asked her if he could get them now
since he has to go someplace else to
stay and she said absolutely not them is
the money in this case she asked her he
asked her if she could get them if he
could get them have you ever had a dream
that she also said that because of that
him asking her she wasn't going to give
him money for six months as she
originally planned but only for three
months because he only cares about money
so he is not staying at mine because he
doesn't have money so he is not staying
at mine because he doesn't have money to
stay elsewhere for two weeks and she
wouldn't even give him a penny she has
his debit card they had a joined account
and she had a separate one but she's
transferred all but 100 pounds that's
all he has for two weeks as you can see
she's not the saint you guys make her
out to be
tom is heartbroken and all she cares is
money and her move she doesn't care how
he feels or if he has a place to stay
for the two weeks the last the edit i
don't understand at all
she doesn't have any he doesn't have any
money so she
he can't stay with her because she
doesn't have any money but he's staying
with me
i i don't fully get what's happening
here um but
i feel like
both op and the guy are are bozos
i'm giving a verdict of bozo here
you're entitled for the record
you know within reasonability to live
your life however you want
you want to be a 31 year old
guy
who
just plays video games all day well you
could become a streamer
but also
um
you're entitled to do that but that
doesn't mean that you know your
girlfriend who is
crushing it in all aspects and doesn't
want to get drunk on the weekends with
her university friends and sleep until 2
p.m
that doesn't mean that
she has to stay with you it actually
seems like i i mean i don't know if the
last paragraph is implying that she
stole some money but like she he doesn't
make any money so how could he how could
she steal her own money
it actually sounds like she gave him
a hundred pounds
by leaving a hundred pounds in the
checking account that she filled up
i mean it's not a lot of money
for an adult to survive but it is her
money
so like i don't see that being
i mean like they're supposed to be
equals right
oh my girlfriend broke up with me but
she didn't even give me any money that's
just like a weird
statement
i don't know i mean again i'm not
getting into the the legalities of like
is this a common law situation i don't
know
british
you know domestic law
but that's not what we're here for it's
not like give me a you know a legally
binding verdict it's like who's a bozo
well like i don't know i feel like
it honestly sounds like tom and the
posters should be in a relationship
together they both don't take adult life
seriously which again is completely fine
as long as they're not trying to fit a
round peg into a square hole and be like
uh married to a a career woman like it's
that those are incompatible lifestyles
so
if you want to have a couple of
ciders and and play fifa all day then
sure you guys you would get along great
what's the problem also i don't
understand why he feels like he should
get more money it doesn't make any sense
to me
my girlfriend broke up with me she only
left me a hundred pounds of her money
she you realize how bad of a boyfriend
you have to be for your girlfriend to
pay you severance
she actually paid you like a [ __ ] off
fee
it's ricky from trailer park boys she
did say i'll pay you 100 pounds to [ __ ]
off
that's an indictment of your character
and two weeks notice
that's crazy
she reduced the severance twice yeah
because you kept asking for more
i would be annoyed too
she told him she had some money saved up
so he'll have time to find a job he
asked her if he could get the money now
since he has to go someplace else and
find someplace else to stay
it's crazy
anyway
i'm still flabbergasted that he said he
would put in an effort to do more around
the house
doesn't make any damn sense to me
hold on i gotta read some comments here
they're gonna dunk on this guy
hold on
hey everybody's dunking on the op but i
want them to dunk on tom more because
i'm just what is he doing man
hold on i'm scrolling you're the [ __ ]
she's too adult she's a [ __ ] for giving
him money he plays video games and gets
drunk while she works i hope she leaves
leaves quickly to go live her adult life
okay almost insulted tom i don't believe
a 30 year old wrote this okay that's
pretty fair everybody sucks here except
ruby okay that's true but go off on tom
please
you're the [ __ ] okay that's true
anyway hold on
you're oh this one's got bullet points
okay i'm
leaving that one behind
oh grow up stay out of other people's
relationships and guess what of course
your friend was super happy i'd be happy
too if someone paid all my bills and did
everything while i sat on my ass and
wasted my own college degree doing
nothing and he said the only problem
they had was her nagging him translation
she was telling him point blank the
things that made her unhappy and the
change she wanted to see and he made
zero effort to accommodate her ruby
deserves her freedom her life will be
much better with both of you gone and in
10 years
you'll have no one to blame but
yourselves you aren't in your 20s
anymore now is the time to build the
life you want which is what smart little
ruby is doing i don't know why she
phrased it like that but she went off
smart little ruby
hold on i'm i'm scrolling until i see
more [ __ ] posts
smart little ruby
whether she's working her job that pays
her too much money
doing all of the financial
responsibilities of the household or
building equity that
skyrockets their net worth if tom came
to me and begged for greater severance
i would have said no
top posts
this week
that was only top poster today holy cow
that's a one that's 24 hours of am i the
[ __ ] [ __ ] posts
am i the [ __ ] for telling my sister
that she overreacted when she screamed
at me for entering her and her husband's
room
what
oh
it's fake
[Laughter]
just looked at it i had no idea they
were doing it
especially since claire told me thomas
has been feeling sick for the past two
days
okay i
believe that one
scrolling am i the [ __ ] for missing
my daughter's birth
[Laughter]
always i think about it like once a week
that episode of unexpected on uh on tlc
which is all it's exploitative don't get
me wrong it's all about teenage
pregnancies
this like 17 year old girl and the 17
year old father are having their second
kid and they're packing the baby bag for
the hospital and the dude packs his ps4
and then she's like why are you packing
that and he's like
there's a lot of down time at the
hospital
is he
not for her
anyway
oh man it's so good just sneak in like a
quick game of 2k while the doctors are
testing my baby's hearing
yeah you're right that's why you need a
switch just play it in handheld mode
okay react core reel here we go
for a little background information i 28
male have a beautiful wife we've been
trying for a baby for about three years
that have known each other since we were
in high school when my wife found out we
were pregnant she was thrilled that
we've been getting prepared for months
now she's nine months pregnant my dad is
a real [ __ ] but he keeps me employed
he owns a pretty nice italian restaurant
that's been run by my family for decades
i've worked there since i was 15 and i
am now the head chef the problem is he
treats his employees pretty bad
including me and if you miss even one
shift you get demoted or even worse
fired i was in the middle of a very
hectic shift on the busiest day of the
week when my mother-in-law called saying
my wife went into labor and i needed to
get to the hospital right away when i
asked my dad if i could go he said you
can go if you're okay with being
unemployed which i couldn't risk because
after the baby was born my wife would be
off work for quite a while to be a
stay-at-home mom the reason my dad was
so mad was because he was understaffed
and really needed my help
fake fake fake
you think this is you really think
that a dad wouldn't say on the birth of
his first grandchild he wouldn't say
you can go if you're okay with being
unemployed
fake fake
when i tried calling my mother-in-law
she wouldn't pick up so i just kept
working and i thought that i could
explain myself later later when it was
time to go home i drove to the hospital
my mother my mother-in-law and her
sisters refused to let me in the room
and call me names like bad husband bad
father when it was finally time to leave
the hospital my wife and newborn baby
went home with my mother-in-law they
haven't spoken to me in days even when i
try to apologize and explain myself i
thought i was doing the right thing but
i need to know if yes
i thought i was doing the right thing i
don't think this i am with you i don't
think this is real but
oh man
that's bad you need to
you need to get a new job
tootsuite if this is real you need a new
job
you never know where grand cherokee's
4x4 capability will take you thankfully
its 360 degree camera will help keep an
eye on things
you never know where grand cherokee's

are they the [ __ ]
for injecting an in-stream ad
to my own content
no
they're the [ __ ] because they're
driving a jeep grand cherokee
owned
am i the [ __ ] for as sorry am i the
[ __ ] for asking my wife rhetorically
if she wants our son to get hurt i'm
gonna need more information on this one
please
i male 28 live with my wife macy
there's a rule that i have you can't
share other people's names if you don't
share your own name
so you got your son's name an infant son
named leo you got a wife macy what's the
husband's name quirky addendum 2779
leo is our first and only child and is
five months old macy works part time and
i work full time macy works on tuesdays
but i don't if macy gets a call to work
on the day that's three days after
tuesday
and i get a call to work on the day
that's four days before wednesday who's
looking after the baby
macy works on tuesdays but i don't macy
normally leaves the house at around 8am
to get to work on time but i like to
take the opportunity to sleep in where i
can get it you are the [ __ ]
you should have thought of that before
you conceived [ __ ] what are you
thinking
are you dumb
you had you had 28 years to take the
opportunity to sleep in and then you
made a decision that gave up that right
okay
whenever macy gets ready for work leo
will usually start crying in his crib
even after he's had his first feet of
the day this doesn't wake me up unless
he's been crying for a little while
because i'm a heavy sleeper it's my my
child cries a little bit but it's
usually easy to ignore for the past two
tuesdays macy has decided to take leo
out of his crib and put him in our bed
with me right before she leaves her work
even though i'm sound asleep she doesn't
do anything to wake me up because she's
leaving for work and leo stops crying
when she puts him in our bed okay that's
also really bad
i'm not trying to judge anybody but
if you don't have a kid you you might
not know there's best practices for a
newborn sleep
and
putting a child in your bed as an adult
is already bad but then putting it in
the bed with someone who may not even
know it's there is way worse
like that's very dangerous
when i say i'm not trying to judge what
i mean you know because there's people
out there that
they they co-sleep with their children
and everything turns out fine but
whenever they say that i'm like that's
like saying you know you rolled the dice
and like snake eyes didn't come up it's
like that doesn't mean that the dice
doesn't have a one on it you know what i
mean
so i'm look if you if you've made it
through that period of your life and
everything's fine then that's great
i i for the i'm less paranoid about it
now but especially for like the first
year of our daughter's life i was like
i would like put her in the crib i would
leave the room and then i'd be like oh
[ __ ] what if um there's a
mild earthquake and a book falls off the
bookshelf and lands on a stuffed animal
and pushes the stuffed animal
onto her face and she suffocates right
like that that's where my head was at
now that she's basically two i've
relaxed a little bit but like this
there are a lot of days where i woke up
and i was like oh she should be crying
by now
i guess she died i guess she died in the
night and then you just sort of like sit
there for a bit and be like
well i'm just going to enjoy this little
period before i have to
face that
and then you wait like you maybe like
brush your teeth and then you go into
the room and she's just chilling and
you're like oh never mind
good morning
[Laughter]
it messes up your your amygdala man
having a kid like you your amygdala
permanently expands to like five times
his normal size
it's not rational
the human brain is is not is not okay
yeah people are saying my brain works
the same way i'm telling you
yes kate has a there's a baby cam video
of me waking her up one day and i like
went in and was like hi and she didn't
react at all
and i was like that's fairly normal so i
like put my hand like on her chest and
started to do like a circular rub and
she didn't react and you can see on the
baby cam it was like a i got hit by a
lightning bolt i was like
and then i just kept i did it for like
another five seconds and she was like
[Laughter]
good morning
anyway
she was just chilling honestly
anyway um nothing bad has happened yet
but i know the risks of putting a baby
in a normal bed with an adult sleeping
in it leo calls it i'm worried he could
fall out of the bed and hurt himself
okay i don't even know you could crawl
it's already bad enough
that he could just be hurt
or worse
but the fact that he can crawl means
that yes he cannot be in the as assuming
that you're responsible enough to have a
box spring
because you have a child you please tell
me you don't just have the the mattress
on the ground like you're living in a
college flop house or something so you
gotta that's dangerous the baby could
crawl off the bed and like hit their
head on the floor
i told her i talked to macy and told her
to leave leo in his crib when she's
getting ready for work macy got annoyed
and said she can't just leave him to cry
and said i'm a bad father for not
noticing and waking up when leo's in the
bed saying that if it was her she'd
notice and wake up i got angry and told
macy that she's being unreasonable
and asked her what she thought would
happen if leo fell out of the bed i
asked her if she wanted leo to get
injured macy got really mad and has gone
to stay with her sister for a couple of
days and took leo with her well now you
can sleep in be careful what you wish
for
hasn't been answering my calls or texts
and still hasn't come home
i've never seen macy this angry with me
before
so i'm wondering if i was the [ __ ]
for now
eta
i don't know what eta means but
i get off work four to five a.m on
weekdays so i'm getting around three
hours of sleep when macy goes to work
macy only works one day a week we don't
need her income and i make more money
but she likes her job and i respect her
choice to work i work 70 hours a week
and do my fair share of housework and
cooking when i'm home so i sleep like
the deceased when i'm in bed okay eta
means edited the ad thank you
okay honestly it's a self-serving edit
but at the same point i am like i mean
it does provide some context
i was gonna say well just wake up but
waking up after three hours of sleep i
mean that's like a forehead moment i'm
not saying you can't do it but it's it's
like setting yourself up for failure
it's like when people say i'm just my oh
my weight loss plan i'm never gonna eat
another carbohydrate i'm like okay i'll
talk to you in two weeks
we'll see how this plan is holding up
regardless
i mean this is
the situation is really bad
but the
resolution is not that bad you just need
to figure out what the hell you're gonna
do on tuesdays man
sounds like six days a week everything's
going okay
just tuesdays
you just gotta you gotta figure it out i
i mean i have more sympathy for this guy
if he's working 70 hours a week and the
time that he's not working he's also
helping
to take care of a five-month-old infant
again you do it to yourself don't get me
wrong but like
i'm
i'm sympathetic at least to this
i have a much easier job i work less
hours and my child is older and at the
same time at the end of the day at the
end of the week especially i'm a little
beat so i i do get it
but your your wife cannot put the baby
in the bed
with you when you don't know that the
babies especially if the baby can crawl
that that's just something you you just
can't do it
why it's like why don't you just leave
him like a swimming pool or something
like that it's it's a recipe for
disaster so i don't know what you're
gonna do honestly is
i do think it's kind of like in
everybody sucks here
that's about it including the child come
on
why are you crying so damn much
get a nanny on tuesdays
i i'll be honest with you
king george the third voice i wasn't
aware that's a thing you can do i think
because my only knowledge of nannies
comes from the show the nanny and the
trailer for nanny mcphee
i thought nannies were kind of like an
all or nothing sort of thing
i thought like if you get a nanny they
like live in your house
or at least they're there like five days
a week
like nine to five or something like that
you can just get in you can get a nanny
for one day that's the thing you can do
there's nannies out there that are like
i'm looking to add another like three
hours a week onto my schedule
yeah tuesday morning is seven that's
great
so that's that's really that works
perfectly for my schedule i'll be there
at 6 45.
yeah i don't really understand i don't
understand the whole nanny system
i i can understand the temptation don't
get me wrong i just don't understand the
i didn't know there was a way you could
just like book a nanny for a little bit
like uber a nanny
it's called a babysitter no
if a babysitter is under the age of
if a baby is if a babysitter is over the
age of 20 they become a nanny right
isn't it like a it's a life cycle thing
like a tadpole becomes a frog becomes a
crocodile
it's like or when pikachu evolves into
raichu like
gotcha
we gotcha
um
you're right i know
everything i said is all true
anyway i mean
i can i be honest with you
i think she's overreacting a little bit
there's probably never a situation where
you should say do you want your daughter
to or do you want your son to get
hurt
that's like not a fair argument tactic
but she did also call him a bad father
you shouldn't be saying that either
this is it's like if you ever go to

r slash which is like the the the dad
group on reddit instead of the mom group
the mom group is basically like 90 posts
that are like how can my
husband do so little and expect so much
and then our slash dad it is all posts
that are like
everybody only asked me what am i doing
nobody ever asked me how am i doing
it's a it's a glimpse into this the soul
it's so true
like you shouldn't call him a bad father
he's working 70 hours a week
he's he's working his tail off you know
anyway
take me back
i love it am i am i the [ __ ] for
asking my wife rhetorically
rhetorically if she would like our child
to be hurt i wouldn't ask her
literally because i think i know the
answer i was simply asking rhetorically
if she would be okay with our daughter
being hurt
hey why can somebody tell me why my
reddit endless scroll does not work
why why is my endless scroll not working
on reddit
i get down to a post i can't go any
further down but there's no like page
numbers or anything
because reddit is ass
it is like the worst website on the
planet
no like it's got to be one of the top 20
websites on the internet by traffic and
it's like the only one of them that goes
down
is there like a tag i can add to the end
of the url
right now the the tag is
question mark t equals weak okay so
we've indicated that there is a tag
and the tag is or the timeline is weekly
end don't crash equals true
can i can i put like another parameter
on this and and put like ampersand
uh
scroll equals infinite or something like
that
yes
ampersand in scroll
let's see
let's see
let's see
hold on i'm scrolling
if i get worked
you genius
you princess of maine
you kings of new england
bro that's all they had to do
i thought you had to get reddit premium
to get the doom scroll
that's amazing
it's probably because you reloaded
yeah yeah even a blind nut gets a
squirrel every now and then am i the
[ __ ] for blatantly pretending my
roommate doesn't exist because of her
quote unquote robbing prank
i live in a very safe city one of the
safest cities in the nation due to this
and lack of parental regulation as a kid
i've never locked my doors i hate this
[ __ ] hold on once that first off i got
to go full screen
secondly i hate that [ __ ]
because that was what we as canadians
have have had to deal with forever is
that because of the damn bowling for
columbine michael moore interviews like
the 20 dumbest torontonians
and goes hey the the people of canada
lock their doors and they're like no
nobody in canada locks their doors cause
crime doesn't exist
everybody that i know in canada locks
their doors
because it takes half of a second and at
least provides like some barrier to
crimes of opportunities also the other
reason i lock my door is not just so
that like someone doesn't break into my
house is also so people that are like
hammered drunk
don't just like
come home to the wrong house or
something like that and go to sleep on
my couch it's just like just like i do i
do that i save myself a lot of potential
headaches that's the that's the big
thing
if someone wants to kill specifically me
i don't think a locked door is going to
stop him
but if someone is just going around
wiggling doorknobs
then i think that you make yourself less
of a target it's the same reason that in
front of our house we have one of those
stickers that's like this is protected
by the xyz security company and then
when our neighbor gets one that's like
we're protected by xyz security company
then we
next to the sticker we put a little sign
in the lawn that says we're really
protected by xyz
security company so that if if
somebody's going to rob a place they
look at the they're like which of these
two houses am i going to go to
of course you're going to go to the one
that has less stickers and signs i told
beware of guard dog trespassers will be
shot on site uh
my other house is a gun you know you get
the idea it's it's an arms race
anyway this why i just don't understand
like you what do people think they're
gaining by not locking their doors
because you're saving no time at all
like literally an amount of time that is
impossible to harvest on a daily basis
it's not like well if you add up the
second that you're saving every day for
your whole life you get 10 minutes no
you don't because you can't you can't
add that [ __ ] up
this [ __ ] is gone it's ether it's like
trying to hold sand in your hand like
it's slipping between your fingers
regardless i just don't understand
understand why they wouldn't
like lock their door it just it's it
seems like
you know what it becomes like a uh
it's like a flex for them it's like look
at how awesome my neighborhood is i
don't have to lock my door
well yeah they still smash your car
window or something like that
regardless i drive a wrangler and take
the top and doors off and i've never had
a problem with stealing okay so this
person is just
they're in love with the fact that they
feel like crime can't happen to them
i've never locked the doors to my houses
or apartments this has never been an
issue with my old roommates or family
it's just the way i've developed
my roommate since moving in has become
increasingly more paranoid and anxious
i've known her for years and have never
seen her like this she thinks there are
cameras in her sink if she gets a bug
bite she assumes she has bugs living in
her bed when she sleeps she has
paralysis where someone comes in to kill
her she locks her bedroom door and front
door for safety okay
she has a genuine mental illness
and like needs some help
[Laughter]
and locking her her room door and her
front door has nothing to do with that
room door is maybe further than i would
go but at the same time is completely
reasonable behavior within the normal
spectrum
the camera's in the sink and the bugs
under his skin not so much
knowing this i've tried to lock the door
however i don't sometimes it's a habit
i'm trying to break fair enough
i came home a week ago there was [ __ ]
everywhere it looked like
a mini tornado whirled through my
apartment i went in my room and my tv
was gone my mini boba fridge was gone
all my vintage playboys were good
this is fake
this is fake
all my apes all my apes are gone
nobody
my vintage playboys
it's not worth anything probably
nobody's breaking into your house and
stealing your vintage magazines you're
using that [ __ ] to like line their bird
cage
quick steal the
bro
i'll take it a step further i don't
think in the in the year 2022 anyone's
stealing your damn tv either
that's an antiquated meme
nobody's going to take your damn tv
they're giving that [ __ ] away at best
buy they're like 75 bucks for a inch
flat screen
that definitely nobody's taking your
damn magazine
they just take your wallet and like sell
your identity on the dark web or
something like that they're not going to
haul out a a tv and try to fence that
[ __ ] on the black market for 20 bucks
okay let's let's continue
it was clear through my eyes that i had
been robbed i sat on my bed and just sat
there in shock on the verge of tears how
could this happen i called my father who
didn't pick up and i was left defeated
practically i jumped up because i was
worried for my roommate's room she was
sitting there waiting for me she had all
my things in there pranked me to try to
teach me a lesson about locking the door
my problem is that she never even talked
to me i had no idea this was an issue
with her before she said i should have
assumed that i need to lock the door out
of respect for a shared living space
actually very true
like if you have roommates your front
door is not your front door that's
there's a shared front door
true but also psycho oh yeah i mean
that's just a given like a medical level
i think
after a trivial arguing i went mute
grabbed all my stuff and put it in my
room and i have completely ignored her
since i'm upset and not over it i find
her thought process alarming and
delusional a mutual friend says i'm
overreacting nope and being rude to her
when she's going through a hard time as
much as i understand that she's having
problems i have received zero empathy or
question of my feelings i don't think
i'm an [ __ ] i think everyone's out of
their minds and i need some time away
from the crazies edit oh boy look oh
jeez
i'm just naive i honestly didn't know
thank you to people who understand i
wasn't being malicious by forgetting to
lock the door also no my roommate is not
insane she's a close friend of mine
and we get along well in every other
situation we do most things together
she's not insane we're friends
doctor
that's my biggest confusion about this
is she's never had a problem with
communication before so i am not finding
another roommate law the one solution
that's obvious to this problem sorry it
wouldn't work uniquely in this one
she's going to the doctor for her
symptoms and help is on the way and yes
my instinct was to sit on my bed when
you enter that level of shock it's hard
to think clearly my perspective at the
moment was that she was not home yet
because her car wasn't there i wasn't
wasn't meaning to be selfish by being
sad about my collections and not
thinking about my potentially dead
roommate
oh man
anyway
um
yeah your roommate is out of her mind
i don't really i don't know if you need
to say anything else about the
subject op is also out of her mind i
think that she's a little naive i think
naive was a good way to describe it
i mean like
i just we've talked about it once every
six months for
five years
you get nothing out of not locking your
doors and you risk something you don't
risk a lot but at the same time like
to to not lock your doors as a flex to
be like i'm not afraid i mean i think
you can draw an obvious comparison that
is unfavorable that i'm gonna be the
bigger man and not even touch upon
you don't have to be afraid you just
have to be sensible if i can go like
this
and minimize my odds of being a victim
of a crime of opportunity why wouldn't i
doesn't mean i'm scared like oh no i
locked the door
i hope nobody takes an ax to it and like
takes it down
it's just uh
you know you just do it because it's
insane and sensible
it's like when i feel
a rumbling in my tumbly i go to the
bathroom and sit on the toilet
it's not because i'm scared i'm gonna
[ __ ] my pants it's just cause you know
if the flow starts i wanna take the
appropriate action i wanna i wanna give
myself every possible chance for success
instead of catastrophic failure
it's literally like it's it's so little
effort to just do this
do you lock your door when you're at
home yes absolutely
i mean because i would rather someone
comes to my house and goes
and then walks away then walks inside of
my house and then i go um hello and i'm
face to face with like a robber
[Laughter]
i don't need to stop them like that's
what the lock is for
yeah you're right i would rather lock it
when i'm home than when i'm away you're
absolutely right
i don't really care if you like i mean i
care but i care less if you rob me
than if you like you know break and
enter my home while i'm asleep or
something like that you can go ahead i
don't know what you're gonna steal in
here
you just steal some assets okay
steal my damn lululemon abc's one of the
pairs already has a rip crotch anyway
my my one million youtube subscriber
plaque go ahead if you can lift the
peloton go ahead honestly
we'll cancel the subscription
my vintage playboys those are in the
safety deposit box okay they're not
getting into that they're in the panic
room
if someone breaks into my house and
takes my fridge i'm sorry to tell you
that i think they need it more than i do
normally you have to call like
professionals to come and take that [ __ ]
so you need like a dolly like a hand
truck or a really strong guy with one of
those
like canvas belts wrapped around his
midsection
am i the [ __ ] for thinking it's fair
that i get a larger portion of food than
my sister oh
man
dude
it might be fair thermodynamically but
let's just look at this
my sister and i recently had an argument
that got very heated about whether or
not i deserve a larva larger serving
size when we have dinner we were both
having salmon and she put hers in the
oven before i did when i put mine in i
noticed the pieces were quite small
however she said she was entitled to
half of it since it wouldn't be fair
that we have different amounts if we're
both hungry for reference i'm around six
one and she's around five four
i tried to explain that we have
different dietary requirements because
i'm bigger and the degree to which i
would be hungry would be greater than
the degree to which she would be hungry
if we had the same portion size though
she insists it's only fair because she
shouldn't have to sacrifice her half for
me though i think i'm sacrificing by
letting her have i think i'm sacrificing
by letting her have half in the first
place
she says that i should supplement my
food with something else if i need more
food but i don't see why i can't say the
same thing to her
we both think each other as being
selfish and don't it doesn't really seem
like we can resolve this disagreement so
am i the [ __ ]
uh m
m i the [ __ ] okay i've been convinced
that i was wrong
the main thing that convinced me is it
isn't her responsibility to make sure
i'm full which is true it's my
responsibility i think i'll start buying
my own groceries
this is the problem with proper
nutrition
you get
people that are adult height with the
child's brain
is this person is three inches taller
than me
and at least
two percent dumber
you shouldn't be this tall if you're
still kind of stupid i'm sorry okay i'm
you should have to give up a little
height
like temporarily
also i never meant to say she should
have no salmon it seems like some people
interpreted that way i just meant to say
i should get a bit more just so you guys
know she did get the salmon not me so
don't worry about that here's the thing
if you want to be this hyper literal
well i'm bigger than you so i have
greater caloric needs then you got to
take it to his logical extreme young
sheldon instead of being like i get more
food in every situation you have to find
your basal metabolic rate plus augmented
by a factor based on your activity find
your sister's basal metabolic rate
augmented based on her activity then you
need to look at the calorie count of the
meal because if you guys are eating a 2
000 calorie dinner and it's split evenly
you don't need half of her dinner to
supplement because you're both eating
too [ __ ] much similarly speaking if
it's a 200 calorie meal you should each
be getting half of it because you're at
like starvation rations okay so there's
only a very narrow subset of meals where
it would actually be relevant that the
taller person needs to get more food
because you're living in a country where
you're posted on reddit and this is
what's bothering you in your life
instead of like i need medicine or food
or water or like a house or something
like that i'm going to assume that you
live in a world of relative abundance
where meeting your caloric daily
requirements is not an issue in which
case why are you getting in your own
[ __ ] way by starting arguments with
family over who gets the bigger piece of
salmon
doesn't make any damn sense
we how stupid do you have what is this
caveman
philosophy
i'm bigger than you so i get more food
at every sitting
oh i had a light lunch today and you
went to mcdonald's yeah but i'm taller
i'm taller than you so like i have
greater caloric needs yeah but you've
eaten more than me today but i'm i'm
taller
i'm taller than you
i'm bigger than you
give me half give me 61 of your ice
cream bar
just stupid
it's like you're
you're not ready for this discussion yet
okay
i am big this is food robbery
i will say it's kind of it's
hypocritical of me because my wife
always gives me the bigger portion and
then i eat it all and then she's like do
you want some of mine i'm done
and then i go yeah maybe i'll nibble a
little bit and then i eat all of hers
too
so i don't have to worry about this
problem in my life because i'm not i i'm
a stud i don't have to hide my hunger
unlike you
but it's not because i'm taller it's
just because i love eating
am i the [ __ ] for telling my niece
she had potential and everything could
have worked out for her too
[Laughter]
am i the [ __ ] for telling my son to
get over it okay
i like that one
exercise wait sorry english is not my
first language my wife and i tried for a
baby for a long time we couldn't have
one we finally decided to adopt and we
adopted a 12 year old boy jared fake
name of all the fake names you could
choose you've chosen one
it's heavily bloated
[Laughter]
could i just get you not
okay kevin let's call him kevin s
okay my our adopted son jeffrey e
my wife and i tried to have a baby but
eventually we decided to adopt we'll use
a fake name to protect the innocent
let's call him oj
let's call him t bundy
um sorry we weren't in a good financial
situation but we tried to do our best
four years after that we had a daughter
jada
a few years after that i got a very good
job we were able to provide a very
comfortable life for jada also i admit
that as jared was our first child we
have no idea how to be parents we were
more strict like early curfews being a
little overprotective and things like
that okay
like honestly
to go from not having a kid to getting a
12 year old is like a nathan fielder
experiment like you
you're supposed to ramp up like every
day
the parenting changes a little bit and
you change in response to the growing
demands and the changing restrictions
right to just get a 12 year old like
handed to you that's that's tough man
i don't think any parents out there are
like um the ideal age when when did i
have the best relationship with my child
uh probably like right when they started
being a teenager essentially
right when puberty hit they really
mellowed out
and then
that's uh so i have some sympathy for
that i'm not just trying to poke fun on
that i'm just saying so there's a
certain amount of sympathy that you
gotta have for that
with jada we had more experience and
didn't make those mistakes wrong you had
no experience from zero to twelve
you don't have to give uh
the parameters you need for a 12 year
old is much different than the
parameters you need for a newborn
oh jada um don't swear so much you know
it doesn't
they i don't think you can just transfer
that
i don't have a 12 year old i know but
i'm assuming it's different
i mean if i'm still changing my 12 year
old's diapers then
we're going to tell them to get over it
now jared is 30 and jada is 14.
time skip
jared keeps complaining about how unfair
it is that jada has a better life we
apologized and told him we wish we could
give him a better life but things were
different back then today he was at our
home and jada was telling him about her
boyfriend and he said you have a
boyfriend i wasn't allowed to have a
girlfriend when i was your age
16 years ago
get over it yeah you know why you should
say get over it
wait a minute wait we're just waiting
for it
then she told him about our trip and he
told me you take her to trips you never
treated me like this guess we know who
your favorite is i just got mad and told
them can't you just be happy for your
sister stop acting like a kid you're 30.
yes i couldn't afford to go to trips
back then just get over it he called me
an [ __ ] and left jada's on my side
and thinks we are being thinks he was
being childish but my wife said i'm the
[ __ ] and should apologize
edit i called jared and told him we'd
love it if he would come on a trip with
us he said i don't want to come i can go
to trips by myself
i don't want to come on your trip mom
and dad i can go on my own trips like a
big boy
i asked him
what
he wants me to do now because i can't
change his childhood and he said he
wants me he wants me to let him live
alone so i'll be doing that he's my son
but he is an adult i can't do anything
to help him if he doesn't want to be
helped why is it why is he the [ __ ]
why is the dad the [ __ ]
i've got to know because the flare said
[ __ ]
like what is he supposed to do get a
time machine and
don't please don't tell me that this is
gonna be like the top post is gonna be
you've gotta make the situation
financially whole
anytime you take your 14 year old
daughter if you but if you buy your 14
year old daughter back to school
supplies your 30 year old son should get
a dividend paid out from the family to
the exact same amount of the value of
the school supplies you purchased
you're the [ __ ] why didn't you
include him in the trip you need to be
more sensitive to your older son's
feelings instead of calling him names
and telling him to get over it sounds
like you definitely favor your bio
daughter over your adopted son and he
knows it he's does he's doesn't he have
other [ __ ] going on
i'm sorry like he's
he's 30 years old if one kid was 14 and
the other one was like 17 then i'd be
like yeah that's a dick move but like
i'm just putting myself in the mindset
like if my parents had a kid after i
went to college
and they were like hey we're taking
we're taking jada
to tuscany do you want to come i would
be like
i gotta knock out the damn
rent you know i mean i would love to i
would love to but
jada has summer vacation
i gotta actually like book the time off
i got isaac videos to make exactly gotta
play rumble verse
i don't know i mean like
i don't think he's the [ __ ]
hi i'm 30
and my mom just took me on a trip this
summer we have a big family and couldn't
afford trips when she was raising all of
us so now that she can afford it she
does you're the [ __ ]
i still i don't know
i mean i guess maybe there's a
just a cultural or a personality
difference here
i can't imagine resenting your parents
because they took
your younger sibling who is basically
part of it who's a child
you're an adult
your sibling is a child
and you're like oh you're the [ __ ]
for not taking me on this trip
it doesn't make any sense to me
also yeah he asked if he wanted to come
on trips and he said no i'm a big boy i
could buy my own trips
soft you're the [ __ ] just get over it
has man up vibes
look here's the thing
99 of the time you should not tell
somebody to man up but there's like a
one percent situation where you gotta
like man up
it's just because it's almost always
wrong doesn't mean it's wrong in all
situations
like you remember the kitchen nightmares
episode
where the lady ordered a hamburger but
they ran out of buns so they served her
the hamburger patty on sourdough bread
and then she started to cry because she
was like they don't have any
they don't have any buns that's a man-up
situation
you're like an adult
your burger's got the wrong kind of
bread
you gotta i'm i'm sorry you've got to be
able to weather the storm there
i'm giving you a soft you're the [ __ ]
for toxic masculinity that's fine
but he didn't say man up he said get
over it
and then they so it's like first off
it's he didn't even you're the [ __ ]
for this thing that you didn't say but
it's kind of similar to this thing that
you said based on uh the vibes
remind him that you chose him maybe
arrange some stuff for you to do with
him
and when he says no you're still the
[ __ ] yes your circumstances have
changed yes you can give your daughter
the life you want to it doesn't stop
your son from feeling the way he feels
okay
that's sure
but he's 30 years old i'm not saying you
have to be like an emotionless husk but
you could like be sympathetic to the
fact that your parents
you know your adopted parents raised you
when they had lower means and then now
they have greater means and be like
happy for the greater success of the
family
and the people who who chose you and and
reared you instead of resenting the fact
that like
your sister is getting to go to like a
you know a holiday in express
you're the [ __ ] you shouldn't have
adopted a kid when you were in a bad
financial position you should have
thought about stuff like this
before you adopted a child you should
have been like what if we're poor now
but we get rich later and we're able to
provide for another child and this child
resents us for it
you got to think about stuff like this
before you adopt
you don't get to just adopt a kid and
toss him out like a practice pancake
what the hell are you talking about i'm
sorry but i'm gonna have to steal
practice pancake that's great user
received gold for this post
practice pancake
it's not a practice pancake situation
this is like the next 20 comments this
reminds me of when you throw out a
practice pancake that one of these days
is gonna hit
so much this
people feel like they're entitled to
children no matter what and don't think
about if they're capable of raising them
he raised them
he just did he couldn't take him on a
trip
when he was 14.
i don't understand
he he's raised
very much this
did the process of adoption create this
financial hardship or failed rounds of
ivf it's funny how much you try to buy
your way into children the less
qualified to support those children you
become is that funny
do i need to bust out the dictionary
this has 143 upvotes
definitely they said english wasn't
their first language maybe they live in
a place with less scrutiny over
adoptions or [ __ ] maybe they don't
dummy
i don't do who knows as long as we're
making [ __ ] up that could be true or
could be false what the hell are you
talking about
you need to man up
i'm not adopted but i'm the oldest
sibling and i'm taking the tossed out
like a practice pancake into therapy
with me next session please don't
your therapist is going to lose respect
for you
i'm sorry
that's the that i was joking about that
one normally say
normally i say i'm not joking that time
i was joking i just thought it would be
funny
therapist is gonna be like jesus christ
this is like the eighth time he brought
up the practice pancake
please
but we the spongebob typing but we
deserve to be parents they wanted to
call to themselves parents of course
they didn't care about the life they
could give to the child they had to stay
in a la quinta in sweets instead of the
marriott
jared was old enough to last them just a
few years till they could have their
miracle jada they would give her
everything they could right after jared
was out o.p don't forget you're still a
parent even after your kid is 18 if you
were regretful about not being able to
give him a better life as a child you
should include him now that you can do
it you're the [ __ ] it's a trip
is this crazy am i crazy
did they did they toss him little bread
crusts hey jared come over for dinner
here's some gruel oh jada how do you
like your beef wellington cooked
it's a it's a trip 16 years later
this game was 14 in like
i can't do the math 2006.
this [ __ ] didn't even have like a
motorola razor back then the world has
changed
it's driving me crazy
okay
did you invite your son on the trip or
perhaps save up to send him on one of
his own you're the [ __ ] regardless
okay well did i choose not to answer the
question crazy187
you're throwing me a suicide pass here
if you ask me a question and no matter
what the answer is you're going to
indict me then i choose to not answer
you're the [ __ ] regardless for
dismissing his frustration because he's
30. you caused the feelings of
inadequacy just because you didn't have
the money then doesn't mean you
shouldn't make an attempt to treat him
equally now i completely understand
where he's coming from seeing the
younger sibling get spoiled after being
raised by strict financially struggling
parents sucks it's not his fault you
weren't ready to be parents you do owe
him an apology though and probably a lot
of money for the therapy he needs
it's crazy man
look i'm not saying you shouldn't
you sh
you're
a 14 year old kid has different
needs than a 30 year old man and
different means to meet those needs
like i feel like if my parents like i'm
33 if my parents had a 14 year old
daughter or son for that matter
i would almost be like
and i guess this doesn't mean that this
person is wrong
but
i would be patronized
if they were like we took your sister
out to red lobster so we sent you like a
a gift certificate to the keg
i'll be like mom that's not
necessary maybe i feel that way because
i'm an only child it's hard to put
myself in those shoes maybe i feel that
way because i was parented very well
that being said i didn't go on any fancy
trips i lived in kingston ontario every
year we went to belleville or ottawa she
was a two-hour drive
we stayed in a holiday inn and then we
ate at chain restaurants that they
didn't have in my hometown
now it's still it was nice though i i
had a good time
maybe i'm just not as a child i wasn't
as into trips as they were but still
but i mean i do maybe it was not so nice
of me to have the opportunity to go to
uh sneaky pizza and eat pizza rolls in
the quinte mall that was 45 minutes away
from the cataract way town center the
mall that i normally go to
but still it just seems it it really
sounds like
they're interpreting this from like the
perspective that like they raised the
first child and we're like [ __ ] you [ __ ]
you here's some dirt for dinner eat [ __ ]
uh 18 years old boom get out of the
house wait look at our precious angel
well well oh oh you know how i'm gonna
[ __ ] over my adopted son i'm gonna get
like a great job and really elevate my
station in life and then uh use my
newfound salary of financial liquidity
to provide them the kind of life that i
wish i could have provided my first
child with
like we're one
dial on the satire meter away from them
being like like the the top comments
being like you should also
uh under provide for your current
daughter
if you really want things to be fair you
should start
uh
putting them on like poverty wages again
you should start feeding them maybe like
a little cabbage cabbage and hot water
for dinner every single night so think
of the 30 year old man okay
he's incapable of making himself
emotionally whole in this situation
i'm not i'm not trying to harp on the
guy
who
whatever he can be like upset like the
30 year old man could be upset
i think it's a little juvenile but i
also haven't been through it myself i'm
harping on the redditors who are trying
to get this dad to like [ __ ]
kill himself in minecraft or something
they're going off on saying he's a bad
dad
it actually seems like he's he's
doing pretty well honestly
i mean he wrote the post so who knows
but still
i don't know
i don't think that not letting your son
date at the same age that you're letting
your daughter date now has anything to
do with how much money you're making
that [ __ ] was [ __ ]
16 years ago
it was 16 years ago
people change
i'm not saying it's a different time i'm
saying is the dad is a different man
he's he's become the second ship of
theseus he might even be like the fifth
ship of theseus
you have a favorite child a do-over
child if you'd rather call her that i'm
sure that he wouldn't
you would rather call her
to make the op look worse
of course that's permanently impacted
how jared sees you
the number of people arguing that it's
not wrong to do better on the second kid
is interesting
the number of people
calling me fools calling me a fool and
an [ __ ] for my [ __ ] comment really
makes me think i didn't call op an
[ __ ] i was very careful not to do
that i said how they've treated their
two children
is the way that an [ __ ] would do that
the way that they're acting now where
they're explaining all the bad decisions
they made with jared as justified
because it's over and can't be fixed
yeah that makes them a huge [ __ ]
sure you can't fix what's in the past
but there's not some magic number of
times you have to apologize that lets
you sweep what you did under the rug
jared does not have to get over the fact
that he had a shitty childhood because
of op
because of opinion he was adopted at age
12.
this shit's driving me crazy man
i don't know what to say
i'm losing my mind there's not even a
single you're not the [ __ ] or like
everybody sucks here
you're the [ __ ] wow op everything
about this screams an attempt to conceal
favorite child vibes he's not happy for
his sister because he was never treated
like this all this early curfew and over
protection sounds like you became a
parent with no prior knowledge which is
very irresponsible
[Laughter]
how could you become a parent with prior
knowledge
that doesn't make any sense it's a
necessary condition
and now you've acted extremely
dismissive of your son okay he's
doubling down to justify his comment his
actions in his comments too he's an
[ __ ] bordering on worse
he came here to have his point backed up
but it backfired because he's a
d-o-u-c-h-e
a douchey
holy cow this is
i feel like i've
everyone on twitch is agreeing with me
right now which is frightening because
it means the youtube comments are gonna
be scary as hell
you're the [ __ ] and it seems like you
raised your daughter into a brat what
the did she she didn't even play a role
in the story she literally just exists
and rocks
she didn't do anything at all
and call the dad an [ __ ] with this
if jada's catching strays she didn't
even do anything she just went on the
trip with her parents
holy cow
i'm losing it man that's you're right
this is a third party you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] at no point your
poster comments do you mention that you
love care or anything
the way you talk it's we made a good
deed adopting a teenager he should be
grateful but looks like when jada came
into the picture she became the golden
child and you pass everything he you
pass her everything he never had i but
he how what can he do what can he do
i don't know what you want
i don't understand i'm sorry
and it's real i'm not filtering this
necessarily through the idea that this
guy is
30 so he must be like a fortune 500 ceo
by now
it's just like i he's 30 so i expect him
to like not openly resent his 14 year
old sister you openly resent your
parents that seems fairly normal but
like
you know you're a grown man
being jealous of a of a teenage girl is
like just [ __ ] weirdo energy
just very strange
can i get one not the [ __ ]
oh let's go he shouldn't take his
resentment out on his sister based on
this post in your comments seems like
you minimized his feelings pretty often
everybody sucks here let's go
one per i couldn't i mean i don't even
think he sucks that bad based on what he
said but still
holy cow
sane redditer shane
redditer not the [ __ ] because you
didn't have money back then you and your
wife adopted him and gave him love and a
stable home you're the [ __ ] he scared
them scared the crap out of me
i got jump scared by the door opening
oh my god
okay have fun love you
you're the [ __ ] for dismissing his
feelings of course jade is on your side
she gets all the benefit of the trial
run with you first jade is 14 years old
you just chill out she's 14.
you're so biased because you're a parent
yeah but i'm also a kid
you know i'm not a child but i'm
somebody's child
i can put i can relate to this like in
abstract not literally though
i don't i mean this is just
this is something i can't relate to i i
don't understand the um
the middle child youngest child like
older child
dynamic
younger children the youngest child is
always the one that is treated as the
baby or oh they tried really hard on the
oldest child by the younger child they
were tired of being parents so they just
sent me out in the yard with no
supervision and the middle child i'm the
middle child oh the older one's being
disciplined and the younger one is being
showered with attention nobody's paying
attention to me they had another kid now
there's two middle children and the one
they used to be
the baby is now also a middle child with
me but i'm also like their older sibling
and i'm gonna and then
then i don't but and i used to be the
baby for a while but i don't remember
being the baby so when i was getting
that resentment from my older siblings
were resenting me for getting the
attention i was getting the attention i
got the benefit but i don't remember
that so i resent my parents for that too
like i don't it just
i don't know it strikes me as kind of
like brady bunch astrology but
i'm not
a psychiatrist or an astrologer so i'm
not sure if i fully am qualified to give
my
diagnosis on that one
or with sibling that's true i'm not with
sibling
anyway regardless let's see let's react
court slash marker



okay the rumors of react court's demise
are uh greatly exaggerated oh thank you
for the raid
from the botes sisters okay your
community is is not ready for what we do
here
we basically argue a lot you know how
like you might be watching a chess
stream and you'll be like what move
would be good here and some people are
like oh queen b3 and some people are
like queen b3 is an inaccuracy you got
to play h6 um
that is basically what we do but it's
with real
people who write fake posts on reddit so
we read a post maybe the headline looks
like this am i the [ __ ] for literally
showing my father how he behaves every
day when he gets home from work we read
the post and and we give our personal
opinion on it as one of the most normal
streamers on this website um which also
makes me
one of the weirdest [ __ ]
when i'm outside in in public in the
city in which i live but anyway thank
you for the raid
appreciate it
it's oh you're on the big stage now it's
scary okay
am i the [ __ ] for literally showing
my dad
how he behaves every day when he gets
home from work what's also great about
this if you've never seen react court or
has been a while
it's always fun
because the title makes it seem like who
knows what how does he behave when he
gets home from work put takes his uh
takes a beer out of the fridge puts his
feet up and then inevitably it's like he
runs around
naked and tries to whip me on the bottom
with a wet towel
so
it you never know just from the
thumbnail what you're going to get
my
so the op is 16. my father is the
breadwinner while mom is assam that's a
stay-at-home mom
in case you're unfamiliar with the
acronym she handles everything around
the house like cooking mopping this is
sorry i get also i get stun locked every
two seconds
to think that
the mind of a child is so funny you
think the second
highest priority chore in the household
is mopping
that's like uh
i mean that's a sometimes chore washing
laundry cooking those are big ones but
mopping
mopping
just get a swiffer wetjet
i'm the oldest and try to help but
really there's only so much i can do
well my dad gets home at the end of the
day and literally complains about
everything like how the carpet isn't
clean or how the food is cold okay so
this is from this is a man from 1956.
as a result i'd have to listen to a huge
argument daily between him and mom it's
exhausting but honestly i think my dad
is in the wrong here i tried talking to
him to get him to see how his behavior
is but to no avail so what i did was
pick a day off for him and pretend to
act like him i put together an outfit
that looked like a suit and put black
tape over my lips to look like a
mustache at 6 pm i went inside the house
shouted i'm home then sat next to him in
the living room and started kicking my
shoes while complaining about the state
of the house at the top of my lungs he
glanced at me confused asking what i was
doing i ignored him then started yelling
about the carpet being dirty the shower
not ready the shower not ready
the kids needing to be quiet and so on
he kept staring while
mom and my siblings laughed my youngest
brother kept pointing me towards
pointing towards me saying this is daddy
i then proceeded to yell about dinner
and berated my mom for not preparing it
before time
my dad stopped me and in a serious tone
asked what i was doing i turned to him
and said what can a man effing rest
after working long hours in the most
macho voice i could muster my dad got
the hint because this was a common
phrase he uses daily the tape on the on
the lips
didn't
tip him off
he went quiet and avoided looking at me
later he went on about how i mocked and
invalidated him that he does work hard
and blah blah blah mom said it was funny
thought i heard my dad's feelings okay
it's a great start this is the fakest
post of all time also can i just say
that you this is if we're assuming this
post is real which is not this isn't
everybody sucks here
okay because you can't
you don't just go out and embarrass
people this is like a revenge fantasy
if you got a problem with someone's
behavior and they're a loved one you
gotta you talk with them it takes time
to modify someone's behavior the dad is
definitely the hypothetical fake dad in
this
certainly
is an [ __ ] as well but at the same
time you don't just can you imagine if
like you had a problem with your spouse
and you did this
if your wife came home and she was
wearing like your clothes and she was
like
uh
what are you complaining about it only
stinks if you breathe you'd be like
what's
like are you okay
we have to get you
imprisoned that like an insane asylum or
something like that anyway
also if this is i hope this is not real
i hope it's not real for this kid's sake
although the story is kind of funny um
i'm i'm worried about what the future
holds true for you if you're
this theatric in in every dispute that
you have but regardless
second post
the king returns make your death night
today and prepare for wrath of the lich
king classic launching september 26th is
the lich king the [ __ ]
or is uh is garrus
valkarian
the [ __ ]
who's the ass not the [ __ ] i've never
played wow
am i the [ __ ] for refusing to take my
daughter to my ex-husband's wedding
you know what i forgot if you want to
really do this you got to sort by flare
you have to sort by
[ __ ]
in order to get the most insane posts
and then you go top posts of this week
why is the top post of this week
six upvotes
top post
this week
filter by [ __ ] phrasing
sort by seabed
it's a slow week
we could just scroll that's fine um how
about this one am i the [ __ ] for
refusing to share my business profit
with my husband well
well well
you never want to go in too hard because
it always starts with something um
that's like you are like
i i can't believe that somebody would
possibly stoop to this level and then
you read it and they're like
i've been going through a very hard time
lately and you're like okay i'm sorry i
shouldn't have judged you so quickly but
that's kind of what this is about
i female32 have a leg disability that
got worse to the point where i could no
longer work so i stayed home with the
kids for four years i had plenty of free
time after the kids became more
independent and i found myself sitting
around all day long i have a sewing
hobby i learned while living with my
grandmother since i was 13. so i started
spending my time sewing my husband made
a laughing stock out of me calling me
grandma or granny and running with the
jokes and teasing it was unbearable but
i ignored him okay i don't look i'm not
taking the husband's side in this at the
slightest
but if you can ignore it it's not
unbearable
but it definitely sounds like your
husband is a real piece of work
it it can't be unbearable and beared
simultaneously
i understand that it's uh
that it might have been annoying also
like listen
your husband calls you grandma when you
sew that's not unbearable
if you're annoyed by it you gotta talk
to at least maybe she did you know then
maybe it's just not included in the post
but that's
might be very annoying and then you go
hey can you cut it out with that [ __ ]
anyway sorry
anyway a friend of mine saw some of my
works and suggested i open a website and
sell what i make i was hesitant about it
and my husband's opinion was meh who
would want to buy grandma's junk okay
why did you marry
uh
bugs bunny
mixed with andrew dice clay
but i asked my friend to help me and
people really liked my works they
started buying them off of me which was
shockingly amazing y'all i started
really investing into this and in one
month i was able to make over two
hundred to three hundred dollars it's
been three months now into the business
when money started coming my husband
would ask me to buy something or make a
restaurant reservation or even fix his
car for him when i refuse he'd say i
have money for my sewing business and
should really pay i decline every single
time he asks
this is
not let's assume it's real because i'd
like to
there's some there's some crazy
family situations out there you know if
you ever watch 90 day fiance i couldn't
believe this being real
i'm not saying it is i'm just saying it
you know it could be
this does not sound like a a couple
this sounds like two
adults that live in the same home
you know once you get married and
different people like they handle their
finances differently after they get
married but at the same time
when
you know the bugs bunny meme where it's
like your sandwich
our sandwich that's what happens
when you get married it's no longer your
husband's car
it's your family's car when it comes to
bearing the burden of like
fixing it
if he uses the car to get to work some
of the proceeds from work fund the
household that allows you to have your
life then that's
your
plural car
if his car breaks down
he doesn't have the money then i'm not
saying you have a legal obligation to
help but you might
do him a solid because you're a partner
you know you're tackling the earth
together
especially if he does i mean it also
depends does he not have money because
uh you know he's been blowing it at the
racetrack or does he not have money
because he's been blowing it on the
mortgage you know what i mean
i'm not again i'm not saying that this
is
oh imagine if the rolls were reversed
i'm not saying that
all i'm saying is if he has no money to
fix the car because he's been supporting
the household
then
you should help him fix the car if you
get a little extra money that's that's
my two cents on this issue but it also
does sound like he's a horrible person
and very annoying to be around but
you did also marry him so i i'm not
again i don't know it's hard to navigate
this without it seeming like victim
blaming but
i think a lot of people here have made
mistakes based on the limited
information so far yesterday he showed
me a wristwatch online that he really
liked and asked if i could pay for it i
said no because i have no money he
pointed out once again this is his
problem i i see now he can't fix his car
because he's been spending all his money
on wrist watches
like it it actually is the 1950s did i
travel through a time machine last night
oh thank you for saying wristwatch i
thought you were talking about a pocket
watch
the fashion choice du jour for the
modern mid-20th century man
he blew up saying
i was being selfish and mean and the
business profit should be split equally
between both of us i use caps because he
yelled those words not just me
i told him he not only mocked me for
sowing he even doubted my potentials
besides that i do all the work so why
should he expect the profit he said that
he is my husband gets half and i should
really consider it or stop sewing
altogether i laughed thinking he was
just messing around but he left the
house and came back looking pissed his
friend called to scold me
reminding me my husband already does
enough for me to be able to find time to
sew and so he deserves a percentage but
i still refused
his friend called you
sorry i scroll scroll me scroll me
he's a grown man he got his friend to
call you and tell you that
wait what's next get like his uh
get his mom the call
anyway now his family are oh okay yes
now his family are pressuring me to
share the money but i'm still refusing
yeah i mean
i'm not just saying this to add
legitimacy
i actually think if you put a gun to my
head and said is this story real or fake
i actually think it's uh real and i'm
not messing with you
it's unbelievable
but it's so close to the realm of
believability
the the the ones that are clearly fake
you know like the ones where they made a
15 year old kid wear a diaper
and it just got increasingly weird like
that's uh
that one you could sniff it a mile away
this one um it does i agree it strikes
me as like a truth is stranger than
fiction
anyway
um
i this one was voted as everybody sucks
here i think it's kind of hard to not
it's kind of hard to disagree with that
even though
and i'm always scared
or wary of a situation where you only
get it from one person's side and they
still look bad
and she does look bad in this situation
you don't have to buy your husband a
watch with the proceeds from your
business you don't have to you know
i don't know make restaurant
reservations that only you pay for and
your husband does sound insufferable
uh also like
maybe there should be like a new flare
this one should just be like
i know the meme on reddit is like any
time you have a disagreement with your
spouse it's like get a divorce hit the
gym get a tan
but at the same time like these people
should not be married
they don't
nothing in the tone here
indicates that they
have like a a good relationship
like even the husband first off is just
insulting his wife and every time he has
dialogue here but also he talks to her
like they're having a business dispute
like i don't think there should ever be
a point in a healthy relationship where
you say uh you owe me something because
according to the eyes of the law
my assets are your assets like that's
you're going down a bad path
in principle sure it may be like the way
you behave
you should do things for one another and
like work on shared goals together and
stuff like that but
i mean this is i don't even understand
what this is this is two people who are
actually just treating the marriage as a
contract instead of as like a spiritual
union so
i mean this is just doomed i guess
these people are destined to
either
get divorced or to have a terrible life
i'm sorry
also you have oh stayed home with the
kids i thought you had four kids i don't
know you might have six kids
i will and here's here's the part
go ahead go cancel me if you must okay
but actually i think most people are
going to agree with this because it's a
base take
if
you were not
working
and your husband was making
the money to support the household
that doesn't mean you were doing nothing
we've said it many times before
that it's actually i i
love the argument because i find it
funny
that like oh
women had it easier in like the 1950s
because the they just got to stay at
home and raise the kids while the men
went to work well i don't know i'm not a
historian i didn't live in the 1950s
believe it or not but from mad men seems
like going to work was a lot of sexually
harassing your secretary smoking cigars
and like drinking in your office and
staying at home with the kids you know i
spend a lot of time with my daughter
she's crazy it's very exhausting
like
admittedly i have the easiest job on the
planet but like
seven hours of doing this job i leave i
feel like more refreshed than when i
started like two hours of looking after
my toddler and i'm like holy cow i'm
beat
but at the same time
there's that reciprocity you know
if he was the bread winner kept the like
that you still got to pay the rent you
still got to pay the mortgage you still
got to buy groceries if he was doing the
financial contributions to the help
to the house and you were doing the
domestic contributions to the house and
now the domestic contributions to the
house are they have less requirements
because the children are older her
word's not mine and you're starting to
make some money i think you should also
feed back into the financial well-being
of the household which probably doesn't
include buying your husband a wristwatch
just because he wants one but it
definitely does include like you know
fixing up the family
uh oldsmobile when it goes down so that
your husband can also get to work
but also it sounds like you guys just
don't have an arrangement um
based on
love or even mutual respect so i don't
know yeah everybody sucks here
i mean every like sucks a lot this is
not just a mildly sucks everyone
involved with this i
i
disrespect you on a human level
sorry
yeah even the lady i'm sorry i
definitely think the husband is worse
maybe they're perfect for each other
uh oh am i the [ __ ] for installing a
gps tracker in my 15 year old daughter's
car
uh update slash answers to questions at
the bottom of the post holy cow
you guys ever read the epic of gilgamesh
because uh wake up honey new
new epic of gilgamesh just dropped
i have a daughter who's 15 years old she
recently got her instruction learner's
permit after she took a summer driver's
ed course and passed a written exam in
my state the learner's permit has a
driving restriction this is heavy people
talk just get ready for it
that the child must have a licensed
adult in the front passenger seat with
them at all times no exception she has
to hold this learner's permit for one
year before she can move up to a
restricted license at 16 years old okay
now after that
exhaustive course in west virginian
driving law
we bought her a car during the summer so
she can have a familiar car to practice
in with us while having her learner's
permit this will be the same car she
will use when she gets her license i'm
trying not to get stun locked
every car is a familiar car
they
you're not going to get behind the wheel
of one and be like what the hell is this
almost everything is in a pretty similar
position the pedals are there the
steering wheels the signal lights
there's a center console
not true not what are you driving
oh i don't know how to do the launch
controls on the bugatti
i'm i'm too used to my lamborghini
murcielago
oh okay honestly if this is manual sure
okay
but
this is north america i doubt it is
it could be
it could be
but i doubt it is
because she said state
and don't you know anything europe
doesn't have states they have duchies
the problem is she's been driving this
car by herself without our permission or
even informing us sometimes we leave her
home alone for a few hours so we can go
to the store or on a date she's been
secretly driving when we are not home i
found out after noticing the discrepancy
in the miles on her on her car this is
the plot of fairest um bueller's day off
this is ferris bueller's day off
don't they know that you have to drive
the car in reverse to take the miles off
the odometer
i found out after noticing the
discrepancy in the miles we scolded her
and told her it was illegal we started
outlining the tires with chalk so we
know if she uses the car or not however
the car did not the shock did not stop
her from taking the car out
wait a minute she got past the
the chalk wall
i don't buy it
you got the the impregnable chalk line
has been breached
i don't want her breaking the law and
i'm terrified of her driving on her own
with so little experience although she
seems to be doing fine as the car has no
damage so i secretly installed the gps
tracking device in the car we then
secretly pretended to leave and waited
until we noticed the car's location
changed i immediately called my daughter
and yelled at her telling her we need to
come home now she came back we got into
a huge screaming fight that ended in
tears she screamed that i was a
controlling mother invading her privacy
and this was her car since we bought it
for us since we had no right to secretly
install the tracker without her
permission
it's everybody sucks day
this is like time machine technology
but this is why you don't buy your kid
with a learner's permit their own car
i never was tempted to
drive my parents cars
when i had my learner's permit because
i mean they were using them i would have
to i would have there's there's a an
extra step i would have to either steal
my parents car keys or i would have to
ask my parents excuse me mom and dad can
i break the law and go driving myself at
which point i assumed they would be like
no and i'd be like i'll go back into my
room and play some halo 2 or something
like that
if someone's not allowed to drive
legally on their own yet why did you
give them their own car it doesn't make
any sense
and then i mean
and just
looking at it from the daughter's side
i don't know if it's illegal but i would
definitely say is like a little
unethical to instead of taking the keys
away just
install a gps tracking device like james
bond
it's like the the worst way to approach
the situation followed by the worst way
to address the situation
it's just it's it's you're doubling down
oh as we're already on the edits holy
cow
or we're close at least
am i the [ __ ] for secretly installing
a gps tracker in my daughter's car edit
i do plan to remove this tracker once
she gets her full license it's only
while she has her learner's permit okay
i mean that's
the minimum
possible baseline for nobility
uh
or for uh for dignity at least update we
drove the car to a local walmart because
i saw they're pretty friendly with
truckers and van dwellers so i figured
they wouldn't mind a car left overnight
we don't have anyone who lives nearby
that we can keep the car at i called an
auto locksmith and they said the
earliest they can come out is to
tomorrow afternoon so we're waiting on
that there's a lot of people who ask the
same questions and i can't respond to
everyone so i'm just going to answer
them here an auto locksmith
it makes sense that that's a thing but i
had never thought about
someone changing the locks on their car
oh you missed the paragraph about the
keys sorry sorry
i would have taken the key back but she
refuses to give it to me and i don't
know where she keeps it oh okay i guess
that's an unsolvable problem
hey thiago thanks for the gifted
subscriptions
by the way
look i'm not saying as easy to parent a
teenager i'm just saying you know
it's
it sounds like you you shouldn't have
bought her own car at 15. i mean that's
just
you made you made a big mistake
to begin with
if your only problem with them is that
they're driving illegally why would you
buy them their own car when they can
only drive it
illegally and then i i do understand
that they could also like why would you
give them the freedom to break the law
when instead you could just wait a year
and they could share the family vehicle
it just i'm not saying that you
entrapped them into breaking the law but
you made it like as easy as possible for
them and then you're like please stop
breaking the law
anyway
why'd you buy her a car in the first
place here we go i wanted her to be able
to practice driving for her license in a
car that would be familiar even after
she got her license that way she would
feel more confident that she knows the
car where everything is driving is scary
so i wanted it to be a really smooth
transition from her to her learners to
her license this is why we didn't think
to sell the car either because we wanted
to keep it for this reason
i told my husband about selling the car
and he said he would think about it he's
the one who paid for it i don't find
this reasonable i know like
i don't know it's
it i mean i guess
i'm wary of this being a boomer take
but i actually is isn't it good that
while you're learning how to drive you
actually get to experience driving a
variety of vehicles
i mean she's 15 years old
it's that your brain is still plastic
you know it's not like mine slowly um
breaking down every single day
due to old age and lifestyle choices i
made in college like you're you're still
growing and learning you're adaptable
uh
when i was learning to drive i first car
i drove
was uh
my driving instructors
honda civic
i also drove my grandfather's ford f-150
my mom had a ford explorer i drove
when i took my driving test i used the
car that the driving test had in order
to take
uh
take the test for people that didn't
have a car because i didn't own a car
and both of my parents were at work and
i like it's just
i'm not saying that every single car is
like exactly the same but i think you're
you're making the problem like too large
the idea that she has to have like a
consistent automobile for like
two years in order to wrap i guess it's
like it simplifies the situation but
also like cars are expensive man
it just seems like you you basically
created a problem in response to
something that you imagined was a
problem which was not an issue
whatsoever
why'd you give her a key in the first
place my parents bought me a car when i
was 14 and had my learners permit they
immediately gave me a key to it and i
never once drove the car without their
permission despite always having the key
i thought my daughter would do the same
thing i've raised her almost exactly how
my parents raised me so i thought she'd
act the same way as i did in the same
situation
we're going maybe again a little too far
you don't
do something like this
be just based on the way that you like
you have to look at your child's
behavior
not the way that you raise them because
people are different
you know like if
two people in the exact same situation
have different personalities or indeed
in the closest possible situation you
could imagine they could still have
different personalities
you know oh my parents raised me like
this in 1975
i raised someone with the exact same
principles in the 2010s and they're
behaving differently in response to this
new environment
also what's the almost
regardless like it's just your parents
shouldn't have bought you a car
at 14 regardless
it just
it just doesn't make any sense to me i
guess i'm still i'm trying to just wrap
my head around it if basically so you
need a chaperone in the car for someone
with a learner's permit to drive which
means the parents have to be home
in order to be the chaperone for their
kid when they're driving which means
that they're not at work or otherwise
outside of the home which means that
their vehicle should be in the garage so
why do you need to get one more you
already have the vehicle
it doesn't make any sense
i look at look and i will say that the
teenager is the one breaking the law in
the first place so they're definitely an
[ __ ] here but they're also you know
15.
i said their brain is growing but like
it's not fully grown yet you
they're going to make mistakes they're
going to not think about long-term
consequences as much as like short-term
enjoyment sometimes let's not cross this
one off the list windows
let's remind me tomorrow let's keep
kicking that can down the road
so i do i i'm of course i blame the
child like
to the extent like not a legal sense i
suppose but to the extent that they are
the ones causing the issue to begin with
but at the same time is like you know
you kind of dared your child to break
the law you made it too easy for them
they're not going to really be like uh
their brain is not at like peak
executive reasoning until like 10 years
from now hey giago thank you as well for
the gifted subscriptions
if if those were incentivized to get me
to do the windows update
i'm sorry to tell you it's gonna be a
it's gonna be a 20
29 hour wait
then it'll happen i've got it on my
calendar and everything
anyway
sorry bring me back bring me back let's
cross this one off your list
why haven't you taken the key i've told
her to give it back to me but she
refuses and even when i searched her
room i was unable to find it
you
sorry
you have other tools at your disposal as
the parent you have you control
all of the economic flow
into and out of the household
you have like legal rights that that
your daughter doesn't have
like why don't you just slash your tires
or something like that
and by the way there's no spare key
you bought her a car but it has one key
even if i was dumb enough to buy my 15
year old child
their own vehicle that it was illegal
for them to drive
like
i would at least be like i've got a
spare key
and then if they kept
taking the car out illegally i would be
like guess what
is my car now
they do have a spare key what are they
that's how they took it to the walmart
okay so that's how they're trying to
solve the situation i understand
they've parked it up they've abandoned
it at the walmart
yeah kids you like i don't know remove
the license plate with a screwdriver
uh you know refuse to put gas in the car
i mean i guess i don't know if the kids
got done
or i could take the gas out of her car
and refuse to buy more but at the same
time she'd just buy more with her
egregious allowance anyway
it just seems like there would be
there's other things at your disposal
you can't be like give me the key no
okay i guess you got me
why haven't you done anything to punish
her i already told her she was grounded
long ago and she does not get to use a
smartphone she still has a flip phone i
don't want to completely take away a
phone because i still want her to be
able to contact me in case of emergency
but has unrestricted access to her
laptop because her homework is posted
and submitted online
i mean
i will this is maybe the one time where
i'm like
this is fair
you want in the modern era i'm sure you
want your kid to be able to have an
instant lifeline to contact you
and access to the internet to do your
homework but at the same time
i mean
if you have access to the internet you
can live like a whole life
online you know what would be a great
punishment though is uh she can use her
laptop unrestricted but she has to do it
in the living room in view of the
parents
that i would be on my best behavior if
my mom was looking over my shoulder to
see what was on my laptop screen at all
times
i would rethink my behavior very quickly
not even just you know adult content i
would just be like
i would just be embarrassed by some of
the [ __ ] that i was laughing at
are you watching that video again ryan
the one piece and remember eat some more
cake eat some more pie doesn't matter if
it's boiled or fried
the one piece is real
are you watching that chibly guy again
why are you [ __ ] posting so much do your
homework
why haven't you disabled the car to be
honest my husband and i don't know much
about cars so this didn't even occur to
us to try
we've tried nothing and we're all out of
ideas man
i've never even heard of a steering
wheel club before
are you serious
[Laughter]
that that's like something you it's
you should have heard of
because it was a huge thing like 20
years ago and is almost i mean you see
him now and then but not very often
these days
we're the type of people who bring our
car into the shop for any maintenance so
i didn't know how to disable the car so
the idea of removing parts of the car or
such never occurred to us
i don't know much about cars i could
still probably come up with some
fairly non-destructive ways um to to
disable a car oh no i would probably
would not cut the brakes
that would the sugar in the gas tank the
ernie mccracken special
take a dump in the driver's seat take
the spark plugs
surely you could just you know why don't
you just lift the engine out or
something like that
why did you think the chalk and tracker
would work
just because it would have worked on me
when i was a teen i didn't like
upsetting my parents okay then that [ __ ]
is irrelevant obviously she is not the
same person as you
i'm just
i'm losing it to these parents that are
like mike the law didn't stop my child
from taking the car out the threat of
like potentially being arrested didn't
stop them you know what i'm gonna do
i'm gonna a little piece of chalk
next to the wheels i've already
discovered you're driving the car
without my permission so here's what i'm
going to do
i'm going to
change functionally absolutely nothing
i'm not even going to make it any harder
for you to break the law
i'm going to do the the bare minimum
effort i mean this is horrible this is
just this is just terrible parenting man
and let's be clear
again
like the child is in the wrong for
breaking the law i also would not well i
don't know like he was a i was a
i was a very well-behaved teenager but
maybe part of that well-behavedness is
just i didn't have opportunities to
misbehave that much you know
i had friends who were
also not breaking the law
i didn't have access to a vehicle that i
could drive illegally like unfettered
unsupervised access to
to get in trouble like that
if i was 15 and my parents gave me
you know more
room
to cause problems and my friends were a
little bit more troublemakers maybe i'd
be in this exact same situation because
you're a kid you know you're just
that's part of growing up is realizing
that you know there were probably only
like that the person you sat next to in
like second grade has a
disproportionate
uh effect on where you go in your life
from that point onwards maybe you're
sitting next to a future valedictorian
you become friends because you're in
close proximity you go to their house
they've got a stable home life uh and
everything's great there and you guys
grow up together and you you achieve
great success maybe you sit next to a
kid who's like seven years old and he's
like hey a recess you want to smoke a
cigarette and then your whole life goes
down
at least it gets pulled down a different
path you know
they're not adults they're kids
they're not they're not fully in charge
of their own actions in the same way
that an adult is so the the kid is wrong
but the adult is the one that has the
responsibility
i mean that the parents are are
actually the the flanders parents we've
tried nothing and we're all out of ideas
man
like they're doing
they're doing nothing
and they
bought their child the thing that is
allowing them to break the law in the
first place so
um
yeah like everybody sucks here but
definitely like the parents
in a legal sense suck more
you should not have bought your i mean
this again it's time machine technology
you should not have bought your child a
car
only
at least until they get their actual
license you don't need to buy them a car
for their learner's permit there's
madness
it's like wearing a
a suit to school on the first day of
undergrad like you dress for the job you
want but at the same time like are you
trying to get wedgied i don't understand
okay the metaphor fell apart but
anyway
am i the [ __ ] for calling my husband
an awful father because he wanted to
leave the house to his biological
daughter only
oh
man
the headline is easy to judge let's
start there
my husband and i have been married for
13 years he has a daughter alyssa from a
previous relationship and i have a
daughter mariah from a previous one too
my husband is the only father my
daughter has ever known and up until now
he has made no distinction about our
children alyssa's mother is still very
involved in her life and spends half the
month with us while my daughter lives
with us full time
not a typical situation for your
husband's ex-wife to live with the
family fifty percent of the year but
okay
i would probably not be okay with it i
think
no it's the daughter oh the the daughter
lives with alyssa's mother is okay it's
ambiguous phrasing okay
alyssa's mother is still very involved
in her life and she spends half the
month with us alyssa spends half the
month with us okay
well my daughter lives with us full-time
my father-in-law recently passed away
and left him their house a very nice
house it's all commas man it's all
commas i can't keep the [ __ ] straight in
my head
i'm just i'm they use one
generic pronoun like at the start of the
sentence an hour eight commas deep
they've introduced like six new
characters okay
her my father-in-law
recently passed away
this is your husband's dad recently
passed away
and left your husband a very nice house
we're actually so excited about this
because we were saving to buy a home for
us for
okay now that we're making plans to move
i told my husband we could use that
money to make some renovations
for when the kids inherited it so they
can sell it and split the money
you've inherited okay
situation aside you've inherited a house
you were also saving to buy a home
and now that we're making plans to move
i told my husband we could use the money
we were saving
to do some renovations
on the house you inherited so that when
the kids inherited it
you they can sell it and split the money
does that sound correct can i just
and this is now like from a financially
financial judgment standpoint
okay that sounds correct
if you've inherited
i guess there's a few things here one is
why
are you talking about your kids
inheriting the house when you die
when they're
16 and 15 years old which means that
you're probably in your 40s or like
early 50s
you probably got a little bit more
runway
the oth on the old house
told my husband we could use the money
to make some renovations when they
it's like they paid by the word but they
got a refund by the comma you know what
i mean
there's nothing wrong with good estate
planning
this is not estate planning this is hgtv
estate planning you know maybe you'd be
talking about setting up
like a trust or something like that or i
don't know buying some insurance but
i'm just confused i guess i mean i'm not
a i'm not a chartered accountant or a
state planning lawyer or whatever it
just is a little
confusing to me i mean if you if you're
planning to probably
realistically die in like 30 years
why are you renovating the house now
like imagine if you got if your parents
died in 2020 and you inherited a house
that was renovated in like 1985 you
would be like
you know i'm in mourning and also i got
to change this pink bathtub
and all the green tile that's in my
kitchen you know
this things change over time
it just doesn't make
like if you're going to renovate it to
raise the value of a home in 30 years
you should renovate it like in 30 years
because you could when you sell it
you're going to be like it's newly
renovated
you don't want to be like hey just so
you guys know this place got
new cabinets 30 years ago because this
[ __ ] is old cabinets
unless yeah maybe they're going to rent
it out now but what kind of [ __ ] hole
are you living in right like i got to
see pictures for they put it there's
only three paragraphs and they wrote
them so i'm assuming that it's relevant
to the situation but it doesn't make any
sense yet
anyway and and also you don't you have
money
why are you spending the money in the
hopes of creating
more money in 30 years there's so many
variables
like you could just use the money
you could put the money in like your own
retirement fund or something like that
so you're not a burden when you retire
which should be before you die possibly
depending on what you're doing like it's
just
i'm just saying that i think this
strikes me as a family that watches too
much hgtv
that's all i'm saying
he said no that the house will be his
daughters the house that
you're not dead yet
there's a long way to go before you in
all in all hopefulness before you need
to worry about this you're you're
getting into an argument now about
what's going to happen with this house
in like 20 years plus
like it's crazy
he said no the house will be his
daughters he doesn't feel comfortable
leaving it to mariah too when she's not
his legal kid and that we could set the
money aside for her because the house
doesn't need that much work anyway which
is true but it felt like a low blow
[Laughter]
he's right but that wasn't my idea so i
took offense to it okay
i said it was unfair to leave alyssa a
full house and remarked how he was
willing to leave it to both when we were
gonna buy one and he said that's because
we would have bought it together so it
was only fair i said he was being an
awful father and asked if he was willing
to leave one of his children homeless
but he said i was overreacting yes
you're the [ __ ]
maybe the husband's being a little bit
of a stickler
but what this sounds like from paragraph
two is that you were having a a
reasonable discussion about something
sensitive not that you know the
well-being of your children which is
also after your death plus money you
know there's a lot of sensitive stuff
going on there it sounds like you're
having a reasonable discussion
and he triumphed in the marketplace of
ideas then you got offended
and you said you're a terrible father
and you want my child to be homeless
despite the fact that it seems based on
the sentences so far that he's been
like a reliable father for the past 13
years plus
i pointed out how alyssa was getting
this house with some of the money her
grandparents already left her plus my
husband's inheritance and her mother's
well mariah only had us
my father-in-law didn't leave her
anything which is okay sorry i'm still
trying to parse this
okay so she's saying it's not fair
it's not fair
alyssa's parents got a divorce which
means she might get more of an
inheritance
because three people are involved in
raising her
it's not fair that her parents got
divorced
okay
he admitted it wasn't fair but that's
just how it is and we could work to make
it as even as possible
i was flabbergasted
i was flabbergasted by this perfectly
reasonable take that
equal
you're a terrible father
he admitted it wasn't fair but that's
just how it is we could try to make it
as even as possible i was flabbergasted
so i just took mariah and came to stay
with my sister he called asking to talk
but i'm not ready my sister said i was
an [ __ ] by
most normal person in the whole post so
far
we love
a family member
who is biased to be sympathetic towards
the person in the post and still calls
out their bad behavior
my sister said i was an [ __ ] because
mariah's not entitled to my husband's
childhood home and it made me think am i
the [ __ ]
yeah
um like
i just i mean first off
i guess my
the origin point of my reasoning is that
this is not a problem
why are you talking ab like inheritance
okay i guess here's the way i'm i'm
trying to phrase this
in the eyes of
the big banks
you're you're not a man and a house and
a savings account and an ira
and you know a
deposit cd and stuff like that you're
just a number okay so when you die your
body gets liquidated you return to the
loan that spawned you and you just
become
that number
why are we getting involved with with
trying to and like approximating it 20
30 40 years in the future you don't know
what the value of the house is going to
be
you don't know what the the value of the
of the money would be if you just gave
like i just i'm i'm just confused i
guess
and why this is a problem to begin with
hey thiago
thanks for the gifted subscriptions by
the way thank you
they're avoiding a problem by handling
it now
they're not avoiding a problem she's
staying at her sister's house right now
that's like that's very close to being a
problem so here's maybe this is king
solomon okay
but here's the way i look at it now
you've you've just inherited a house
you've also got money that you were
already using
to purchase a house okay
let's talk about some some situations
you could do here
wait okay can i go a step further
you're
presumably i i even want to walk it back
one step further than i was going to
walk it back you're presumably like 40
something years old you need the money
you're in like the prime of your
financial
earning power and also the prime of your
financial obligations and it's it's his
parents that died
you should use the money
you can write a will
that's like here's how we're going to
divvy it up in the unlikely event that
we both pass away suddenly or something
like that
but you don't need to
like
solve the issue right like you don't
need to sell the house and then split
the money from that house between your
two teenage kids and then
uh
take the money that you were using for
to buy a new house and like
worry about how that's gonna get split
right now you just
like you're the adults
maybe this sounds like boomer pill but
like you you should be making the
decisions right now
it'll feel like a slap in the face for
the stepdaughter
listen there is a chance that they could
die okay
like accidents happen illness etc etc
but you don't need to
like
tell her what the will looks like right
now
i know that sounds but like it doesn't
need to be a slap in the face
like she's 15 years old she's in high
school she's got she's figuring out like
her own way in life after this you're i
think that it's much more of a danger
that the family drama from the
hypothetical
conflict that could happen with the will
is going to screw up her family life way
more
than
like
i don't even know feeling slighted
because she like she
at this present point probably doesn't
even care about the house it just seems
like a she probably cares about you know
getting tickets for the harry styles
tour date in the city that's three hours
away from their suburban home okay
it just doesn't
it just doesn't seem like an issue
that's germane to their well-being right
now
your
husband's father died and left him a
house why are you getting complicated
with
like we're gonna
renovate that house so in 30 years when
we die the house that we sell
will give more money to both kids like
that's you you have
you have the money
why don't you just
move the money that you're gonna use for
the renter the renovations
like into your
retirement fund
use that money to retire earlier or more
comfortably
thus lessening a potential financial
burden on your children to begin with
and then if you die and you still have
money in your retirement fund then you
split the retirement fund between your
kids
it just it seems like they're working
too hard to create uh
a problem that has no reason to exist
yet
what if i die in the middle of writing
my will i don't know man it just seems
stupid
it just like i don't i don't see look
though the reason i'm stunlocked for the
most part is because it doesn't make
sense to me if you were saving money to
use for a house
to then
if you get a house move to uh that house
that you just got and use the
renovations
use the money that you were saving for a
new house on renovations on a house that
you're not gonna live in anymore it that
doesn't make sense to me
am i missing something there
why wouldn't you renovate the house that
you're going to live in so you can enjoy
the renovations
they're not getting a different house
okay i sentence you first
to
a remedial
english writing class i know that sounds
harsh but it is germane to the
proceedings of the court today because
we cannot accurately rule on the case
with the ambiguity present
in your diction i'm sorry
there's too many variables at play that
have no reason to be at play here
i also i i do think i don't even think
this is in everybody sucks here i have a
problem with the wife in this situation
because
the husband said
we'll make it as even as possible and
then she said i'm taking the kids and
going to my sister's house that's not a
reasonable approach
i think you have to i mean the real life
can be messy sometimes i don't if you're
making it as even as possible then the
good faith take there is that one of the
kids gets a house and then the other kid
gets a an equivalent amount of assets
and cash to the value of the home
you really think your kid is going to be
so stupid that they're going to be like
oh i got all this money but my
stepsister got a house
it doesn't make any damn sense
i don't think i mean i think that it's
an unfavorable interpretation of your
future daughter's intelligence quite
frankly
he's got two daughters he needs to take
care of him both
dan carlin voice and i quote
he admitted it wasn't fair but that's
just how it is and we could work to make
it as even as possible
as even as possible end quote sorry as
even as possible is 50 50.
i don't get it i doubt his statement
okay that's not admissible in this court
of law
i also i mean maybe i'm guilty of being
avoidant i suppose
but like
i still don't understand why this is
such an issue right now
if she wrote in the start of this we're
writing our wills right now and here's
why it's complicated
well then you shouldn't be on am i maybe
that you know what that's a good thought
experiment because if that's the case
you shouldn't be on reddit you should be
talking to like a lawyer
that's what
legal disputes are for i'm not saying
like to litigate against your husband i
mean like just getting advice
for how you should handle it in the
future he doesn't sound like an
unreasonable man
maybe the lawyer would be like hey just
so you know uh
sure you could give one kid the house
but if you wanted to give half of the
house's value to a kid you could uh use
the house as collateral to take out a uh
an asset from the bank that would allow
you to get
you know the half of the house's value
to pass to the other child and then they
would slowly pay it back over time with
an interest rate lower than prime or
something like that it just doesn't
like i'm this is just a hypothetical but
like why are you trying to work out what
the future is going to be like in in
2050 and and getting mad about it now
anyway
what if they're not nerds of course
they're nerds they're on reddit okay
you're the [ __ ]
i mean reddit is going to be like worse
to this woman than i was to be honest
so like get ready
[Laughter]
you're the [ __ ] your daughter is not
entitled to his childhood home and your
husband was definitely making
concessions to make it more fair for her
by offering to save up money for her
it's really narcissistic and actually
selfish of you to expect your husband to
leave his stepdaughter your daughter his
childhood home from his father when
usually stuff like that goes down the
bloodline i could see being upset if he
was trying to exclude her from anything
but he's not you need to
re-evaluate your attitude and your
thinking before you lose a good man
i honestly kind of agree
maybe not the good man part that this is
something about that smells a little i
don't know like they've got an ulterior
motive and down the bloodline but still
i think there's a point to be made here
you're the [ __ ] why would he leave
his father's house to someone not
related to his father his daughter is
your father-in-law's actual
granddaughter it makes sense for her to
inherit it over the daughter from the
previous relationship he's not a bad
father he's a logical one
you're the [ __ ] hugely he's keeping
his the house in the family
it's not like he's kicking her to the
curb presumably y'all are gonna give
money and more to your daughter like he
said okay yes
you're the [ __ ] you are okay this one
i don't i don't respect the list i'm
sorry to say
info is he leaving you with the right to
stay in the house after he passes if not
do not spend one penny of your own money
on that house i too live in a fantasy
world
info
if he passed away uh on a in a plane
crash 31 years from now
would you legally be able to stay in
that domicile otherwise i would
contribute nothing financially to the
operation of that household for the
intervening three decades
i don't know if it was right to call
your husband names but i think there's
some serious concerns here
okay here this
i want to not read this because it
disagrees with me which is why we should
read it
presumably you have been working
together to pro to provide a joint
household for these 13 years and your
assets and time and energy have been
poured into this family it's great that
a house essentially fell into your laps
while you're working to buy one but what
do you have to show for your 13 plus
years of effort and security
what do you have to show for your 13
plus years of effort and what security
do you have in this marriage if this is
his house and he plans to give it to his
daughter once he passes and you might
still be alive
i feel like
i'm taking crazy pills
to some extent
well okay maybe i'm not or maybe i am
taking too many crazy pills
legally speaking
the husband
inheriting a house
means that the family has inherited the
house that's i understand that okay
i have been interpreting this perhaps a
bit too charitably to the father
that he is choosing to let's say the
house is worth five hundred thousand
dollars that he's choosing
to give five hundred thousand dollars
worth of house
to his biological daughter
and then if they have an equivalent
amount of assets 500 000 worth of assets
would go to the step-daughter i'm that
essentially i'm i'm choosing to believe
that for sentimental reasons
he's giving his daughter
the house which he has family mem
memories attached to and then the not
house equivalent value to the
step-daughter because she has no
memories attached to it
maybe that's too favorable i also
understand that people don't think about
houses that way
like if i if i gave people the option i
said would you rather have five hundred
thousand dollars or a five hundred
thousand dollar house people would be
like i'd rather have a five hundred
thousand dollar house that's worth a
million dollars
you know they have like it's uh
they a lot of people look at it as if
it's more valuable than the
value of it at the present
sorry i'm just basking in the plus twos
anyway
i think the opposite i know thank you
every time i do i visit my
brother-in-law he's always talking to me
about how oh man you ever considered
like starting a bodega in vancouver i
think bodegas would really pop off and
i'm like man i think i'd rather just i'd
rather just buy some stocks
i don't really want to manage a
convenience store or something like that
i don't know first off it sounds like it
takes a lot of money secondly it sounds
like it takes a lot of effort couldn't i
just give that money to jack bogle
instead he gives it to you know market
cap weighted index fund of the top
countries in the world or something like
that and then they just do what they do
and i just kind of get to live my life
anyway
so i'm like you gave me the choice
between the house or the
money i would rather have the money but
as i also do have a house to be fair
although i guess i would use the money
to help pay off my mortgage
so i guess i would be buying house with
it to begin with but we're getting too
you know into the fine grain details
it's great that a house fell into your
lab what do you have to show for 13 plus
years of effort and what security do you
have in this marriage if this is his
house and he plans to give it to his
daughter what kind of equity have you
it's too many question marks what kind
of equity have you built for yourself if
this house is all his
why this why does she have equity in the
house that
his parents
bought
i
she has equity in her house that
presumably she's been helping to
pay the mortgage in why does she have
equity in in the house that his parents
bought
because they're married
yeah but okay and that's i on a legal
level i accept that but
what do you have to show for your 13
plus years of effort and what kind of
equity have you built for yourself
you've built the equity that you built
i don't think he's heard of of double
equity pippin
they don't have a house
i think maybe i'm i'm guilty of looking
at this from too much of like an
economic standpoint
it's like if you've been paying rent for
13 years
of course you have no equity to show for
it
i don't understand i'm just confused
i'm i i i get this is why they need to
talk to a lawyer
because the [ __ ] doesn't make any damn
sense
like they need more information
whose money is going to cover repair
will you be paying taxes on it or
insurance
are you going to put money and energy
into this house for 20 years and have
nothing to show for it whose money is
going to cover repairs it seems like it
makes the most sense to sell this house
and use the original money you save to
buy one together
you seen the real estate market lately
man you see you see what the the the the
expected
mortgage rates are going up too soon
this would be if the house is paid off
here's what you should do you should get
a divorce you guys don't respect each
other but you you would save so much
money if you just moved in as a divorced
family to this house and had no mortgage
holy cow
and then instead of paying six percent
on a new mortgage in the house that you
were gonna buy you should just take the
money that you were going to spend on
the house and put it in like a gic and
earn five or six percent on it
and your your and then when the the
whole subprime mortgage crisis 2.0 comes
back then you're going to use that to
jump into the housing and you could be
the new wolf of wall street
just make yourself miserable to get some
arbitrage
however you decide to split that home
for future inheritance between the two
girls will be tricky
but staying in this home that was given
to you without giving you any security
in it is not wise
you're being exhausting i mean i'm just
saying i don't understand i guess
someone said put yourself in the in
this situation and see how you would
feel i mean that's what i do for this
that you like to give my opinion on it
to begin with but like do you know how
many steps you got to go through to do
that
okay i gotta now imagine i have not one
teenage not one child but that child is
a teenager and then also another teenage
step child and then my parents died and
no kate's parents died and left her a
house and they were like only her
biological child is entitled to the
house we'll try to give your
child an equivalent amount of assets i
think it's just i can't you're right i
gotta go on the rehearsal
this is these people should talk to a
lawyer they should not talk to reddit
this is the realest post of all time
because it's not entertaining it's just
frustrating that's real life



towards demise are greatly exaggerated
here we are we're back again with the
top post of the week on our slash Mi the
[ __ ] filtered exclusively by insane
people let's go see what's going on in
the world today
we're living on the edge
I love you I can't watch this is Rage
inducing yeah I was not everybody some
people don't have a tolerance for like
cringe humor like they can't watch the
office because Michael Scott's too
awkward some people can't handle like
rage humor as well and I honestly I
respect that I can totally understand
that
I don't blame you by the way am I the
[ __ ] for telling the new neighbors
they got what they paid for including
being shunned by the neighborhood where
I live real estate developers have
started snatching up family homes
bulldozing them and building enormous
two million dollar houses on the plots
of land these houses stick out
horrendously in terms of Aesthetics
think single level brick homes with a
gigantic three-level gigantic I can't
read
with a three-level gigantic white and
black box in the middle okay I
understand so it's a modern home
they've made it in the Scandinavian
style it's a Scandinavian mcmansion my
home's been in my family for several
Generations we have always been known
for having a large beautiful garden we
invited our over kids to help with
gardening we gave away so many veggies
we'd hold parties it's been a
neighborhood treasure for years a
neighborhood treasure until developers
snatched the lot next door bulldoze and
erected an enormous out that house that
blocked out the light to most of our
garden many of us tried to fight it with
the city but everything was denied it
was heartbreaking our neighborhood has
been changed forever this was a link to
my family and I almost had to go through
a grieving process for it okay so far
that sucks so far I would say
I I understand why you would be upset
okay I'm not saying you have a great
case
but I can understand why you would be
upset the new owners moved in and were
not welcomed warmly by the people in the
neighborhood I avoided them for as long
as I could other than politely waving or
nodding it was a young couple in their
early 20s we finally came face to face
and the woman asked if we could chat she
said she felt like maybe they'd done
something wrong when they moved in or
they aren't pulling in their trash bins
or something being too loud because
people have not been friendly the guy
says he's surprised considering it felt
like a nice and affluent neighbor
neighborhood and given the price he was
expecting friendly Neighbors
um
sorry I need to scroll a little bit I
apologize I asked if they'd done their
research about the area they said they
moved from California so no I said maybe
that was your mistake
oh you thought you could just move
places you thought you could just move
to a small town without talking to the
local archivist to figure out if you're
gonna if your house is gonna block the
East sunlight for my garden
they said they didn't know what I meant
so I asked if they'd ever looked in our
backyard they said yes and they think
our garden is cute I said yes the garden
that now has half less sunlight than
before that house was built it was a
neighborhood treasure the guy said well
it's not our fault you built the garden
there is it I said well you guys got
what you paid for a two million dollar
house in the neighborhood that everyone
hates I said I hoped it was worth it and
wish them a nice day when I told another
neighbor about the exchange she told me
she does feel bad for them moving in
without having any idea what they're
getting themselves into am I the [ __ ]
for telling them they got what they paid
for you're not the ass over telling them
they got what they paid for
that doesn't like what you're kind of
the [ __ ] for thinking that's an own
what's the OWN
they have a two million dollar house
and then like they're next door
neighbors who they'd probably very
rarely have to actually interact with
they resent them because they blocked
they created a shadow they resent them
because their house casts a shadow
it's just weird
I I don't know how much meat is on this
bone I don't know what to say
foreign
you don't get it this is a different
neighborhood
people always say stuff like that
they'll live in a town of like 5 000
people and they'll be like you don't
know what it's like on cantaloupe Avenue
cantaloupe Avenue cul-de-sac hits
different we got a different culture
over here on Spruce Avenue than they do
on First Street and Oak Lane okay
if you wanna you you go you go to Maple
Crescent if you want to try that stuff
on ash alley we don't do that kind of
stuff okay
I I just don't understand like this is
such a nothing situation for me I can't
believe it's one of the top posts on the
subreddit this week I guess because it's
so cut and dry
I can sympathize with the person it
sucks that you had this sick garden and
then now a shadow has been cast and it's
uh
it's ruining your garden I get that you
can't just like dig it up and move it
easily like you can do it but it's
probably going to cost some money it's
probably gonna like be a lot of work but
at the same time it's like also people
are living there
I don't understand I don't I guess I
don't understand the problem
everybody's bored by this myself
included yeah I know if this is fake
it's not even like
I don't understand
I feel like if if this was fake this is
this is like
someone is writing a fantasy about how
much they hate that Californians are
moving to their city and raising the
cost of living which I can understand
but you don't reply by being like a
[ __ ] and also how did you get there
in the first place this is that like the
subtext of all this
because we go through it in Vancouver
all the time people are like oh I'm so
sick of people moving to Vancouver uh
from other parts of the country in the
U.S and raising the cost of living I on
the other hand moved here 20 years ago
raised the cost of living for the locals
like in the early 2000s but that's not
as big of a problem now because I
benefited it from it back then like it's
just it's a matrushka doll of like
moving to nicer places and making them
more expensive as a result you know
just because you did it first it doesn't
mean that if someone does it after then
you gotta like they're the problem
yeah they don't even take it back to
like it's logical the starting point
where all the land was stolen anyway but
it's just like you know
I mean I'm not I I just don't understand
I get that they're young and they have a
two million dollar house we're supposed
to hate them but also like you inherited
your house so [ __ ] you too
it's not even in everybody sucks here I
don't think that the couple did anything
what are they supposed to do not build
the house because it's going to cast a
shadow on someone's yard it doesn't make
any damn sense
none of this makes any sense
like even the top comment is like this
your your anger makes no sense
whatsoever
you're the [ __ ] they just bought a
house so true did you research the
neighborhood is your garden a big thing
so well known it's in the papers the
people could know about it without it
couldn't know about it without having
talks with the neighbors before moving
in even then they did not design the
house they just bought it and you are
being angry at them as if it is yes this
is it's insane
you can fix this pretty easily make a
pie or buy a small housewarming gift
bring it to your neighbor tell them you
know we fought against the Builder who
built your home it broke my heart with
my garden lost his sunlight but neither
of those things are your fault I should
have been a better neighbor and I'd like
to fix that going forward nope that's
never going to happen
instead they will be on neighborhood
Wars on TLC
sorry so I'm zooming down zooming down
scrolling down zooming out
I'm zooming out I'm breathing in the
copium oh whoa
yeah what is this the 1940s we don't do
that [ __ ] anymore you just passive
aggressively like post on next door
um I think there's a strange Vapor
emanating from my neighbor's home I
think they're cooking crystal
methamphetamine in there officer
you're the [ __ ] okay I mean this is
just there's there's nothing here man
there's nothing here
I I take it back we find a new post
am I the [ __ ] for telling my former
friend turned sister-in-law that I'm
never gonna be her Comfort person ever
again oh dude this is a [ __ ] essay oh
my God
holy cow this is a saga
I had 25 male used to have the biggest
crush on my childhood friend Emily as a
teen I wasn't very assertive and a
little awkward so I never made a move
and just hoped that one day Emily would
realize that I was the guy for her
everybody's been there the only person
who I openly admitted my crush to
although it was kind of obvious was to
my brother Liam 28 male he was much more
assertive and confident than I was and
when run through girls like water
notoriously uh great medium to run
through
water but anyway I went to him for
advice about Emily Mystic tacos thanks
for the gifted subscriptions thank you
given the situation at the time you can
imagine my surprise when I caught Liam
and Emily hooking up this can't be real
this is this is fiction
I know that she was technically never my
girlfriend but it still sucked and I did
feel betrayed turned out they hooked up
at a party once and liked the encounter
so much they kept meeting up to do it
when no one was around yeah that's
probably like the most common way to do
it I would say
it would be they would be the [ __ ]
if they'd waited until people were
around and then they started to do it
that would be that would be a public
display of affection beyond the bounds
of normalcy
I felt sick and distanced myself from
Emily after that which could be really
awkward because we had a lot of classes
together and had the same shift at the
part-time job we had a job that Emily
frequently depended on me to give her
rides to so she was in high school this
is like 10 years ago okay
I just wanted to remove Emily from my
life completely but during the summer of
our senior year
she and Liam sat me and my parents down
and explained that Emily had gotten
pregnant and were planning on keeping
the baby my parents weren't Happy Well I
got up and locked myself in my room all
I could think of was well crap now she's
never gonna go away I purposefully
transferred to an out of state college
so I wouldn't be home as much and lied
about getting stuck in traffic when I
missed Emily and Liam's wedding and I
showed no interest in my niece Daisy
although I still make the effort to be
polite when I'm around them that's big
of you that's big of you that you don't
take out your resentment of your high
school crush on her child who is also
your niece
the history just dropped
recently Emily's father passed away and
she's really going through it which is
hard on me because she needs a lot of
support because despite him not being
around she always desired a relationship
when we were kids I remember all those
times I was a shoulder for Emily to cry
on when she felt sad about her dad and I
guess she was longing for that type of
comfort for me and kept reaching out one
day I relented and let her vent but I
maintained a silent and formal demeanor
on the matter after spending about an
hour crying I offered Emily some water
oh man then she asked me why I was being
so cold how I know how much she needed a
friend right now
I calmly yet firmly told I calmly yet
firmly told her that we were just kids
then and if she wants that level of
emotional intimacy then she needs to go
to my brother her husband because I
stopped being her Comfort person a long
time ago
holy cow
did you put your name into the Goblet
what is this Dumbledore in Harry's stuff
is this uh
is this a fan fiction a Harry Potter fan
fiction
or is it just Harry Potter
it might not even be fan fiction look it
up on YouTube what is it though the book
says calmly but in the movie he shouts
okay okay
fair enough
Emily cried more left and has managed to
send Liam my parents Emily's Mom and for
mutual friends to call me up and tell me
I'm heartless and sad for being so
spiteful I can honestly say I'm now over
Emily but that doesn't mean I'm willing
to be as close to her as I used to so am
I the [ __ ] yes you are the [ __ ]
like sure there's a way we'll read the
edits or whatever
because like the way this reads here's
what actually happened
okay you as look so a high schooler you
had a crush on a girl
you didn't know the stones to ask her
out happens to everybody most most
people at least we have a story like
that now she's still in your life
assuming this is real which is probably
not 10 years later you're not 15 years
old anymore you don't so like you're
still harboring some resentment for it
whether you have a crush on her or not
you're still harboring resentment for
the fact that she's part of your family
but not with you you got to get over
that even if you're not over that the
time to bring it up is not like when
you're comforting her and she needs some
emotional support after her father died
you gotta like and I understand it's
human nature when a situation is not at
a flash point you're like I don't need
to deal with this right now I can delay
it I can delay it we don't need to talk
about it right now but that is when you
need to talk about it so that when
you're at a flash point and you're
bubbling over you don't start a house
fire you know you gotta talk to her and
be like hey just so you know like I was
I I have to distance myself a little bit
from this situation or like we we can't
have the same kind of relationship we
used to have because I feel awkward
because I'm like half on your side
because we're great friends and half on
my brother's side because we're family
so it's a little awkward for me to do
this you can't you can't do it and be
like well actually I can't give you
sympathy for your father dying because
of the fact that I had a crush on you 10
years ago like that's you've made it
about you when you're like a a tertiary
character in her story right now anyway
that's why you're the [ __ ] you don't
wait until she's in a vulnerable place
and then hit her with a Kill Shot you
know
like like she's downed in Pub G and
you're just finishing the job you gotta
you gotta handle that you got to discuss
that at the time of the drop where you
whether you're going to rosehawk or CDOT
had to step away and after looking at
the comments and DMs I just wanted to be
clear about some things not an incel did
I exhibit some nice guy traits as a
teenager yes as an adult now I realize
that Emily doesn't owe me a romantic
relationship I was more angry at my
brother than I was Emily because he was
my brother and new I mean that's there's
fairness there there's kind of an
[ __ ] move from the Big Brother
I don't see how me not taking an active
role in the life of a child I didn't
make is me punishing someone I say hello
and give gifts on Christmas and holidays
so so defensive
you don't need to be a father to your
niece but the way you phrased it was
like uh I'm the bigger man because I'm
polite to a child even though I resent
their existence like that's the
that's why people think you're being
weird about it
nobody's suggesting that you don't get a
gift certificate to the mall or whatever
or get her a hatchimal every December
but at the same time the way you phrase
it would you didn't even really have to
bring up the niece except you wanted
some good guy points for like I don't
hate this child even though they had
nothing to do in their own creation
again Emily is married so I find it odd
she would seek out someone who isn't her
husband for emotional support yes I did
give my condolences because it's the
polite thing to do not because I wanted
to
not out of a sense of human empathy
because I wanted to not because I wanted
to because it's the polite thing to do
according to the bro code
Emily and I haven't had meaningful
contacts since high school partly
because she was busy getting ready to be
a mom and I was hurt and trying to get
over her
men and women mature at different rates
okay that's just
that's this is emblematic of that
things I didn't include because of the
word count yes I have a girlfriend and
from what I can tell we're both very
happy people are going to be like yeah
sure but like you know you never know
I gotta take him at face value
I got my doubts but I'm I'm treating it
as if you've sworn an oath of honesty
for this yes my girlfriend knows about
my former crush on Emily yes I have
friends who are women
yes I do believe people of the opposite
sex can be just friends when they're
adults also in spite of everything I did
learn to be more forthcoming with my
feelings which is why I told Emily I
can't be your comfort person although I
will admit there could have been a
better way in timing no it's not that
there could have been a better way in
timing there almost couldn't be a worse
timing
it's a huge understatement to say there
could be better timing the timing is
almost as bad that's a once in a
lifetime
event like losing one of your parents
it's possibly the worst timing you could
even muster in fiction
update okay I've stepped away he's
always stepping away
I know it's not that he it this is I'm
focusing on semantics here
the way he keeps phrasing it like I had
to I had to cut myself off in this
situation briefly
like it's just it's just weird
because I've come back with a cooler
head and I've decided to argue my case
even more in spite of uh you know the
comments that I'm reading
I can accept the way I told Emily I
couldn't be her Comfort person anymore
was wrong the timing especially I do not
feel bad about being honest with where I
stand with her I am not sorry about
keeping my distance and I've yet to
regret not pursuing a relationship with
my brother's daughter you're so weird
man
she's eight years old
I whoa I mean if my niece wants an uncle
she's got my phone number like why is
why are you so freaky about it
it's just strange I've never regretted
not being friends with my eight-year-old
niece
that's because you're [ __ ] weird dude
you're being really weird about it
I don't know if Emily ever found out
about my feelings for her because it was
never discussed but I don't see how
telling her now would change anything
I'm truly over her and happy with my
girlfriend I would never pick Emily over
my girlfriend I yet to see a reason why
I need to rekindle a friendship with her
in order to prove it to anyone my
brother betrayed me he knew I felt and
still went after Emily and I refuse to
ever be close to him ever again over it
this is my boundary and so far it's been
working out well for me and the day our
parents die is the day I cut Liam out of
my life completely okay sanest
redditor spotted
um yes you are the [ __ ]
obviously I mean just at the the
principal level for picking the the
worst time you could ever imagine to
take out the resentment you had on an
unrequited Crush from high school as a
man in his mid-20s that's just that's
just juvenile that's some that's some
baby stuff
I'm sorry to tell you but part of like
being an adult with friends and family
is like some days you're going to be
like oh I can't wait to get home from
work and like you know play Tetris 99
and then you get a message from somebody
that's like can I call you and then you
gotta Comfort them a little bit because
that's what you know today you tomorrow
me
that's what being an adult that's not
what it's all about but that's part of
it most of the rest of it is just paying
bills
am I the [ __ ] for feeding my dog
table scraps from a dinner my boyfriend
made for us this one's weird because
it's like so far not really
it depends on the situation the problem
with feeding table scraps to a dog I'm
not a dog owner
but as I understand it the problem with
feeding table scraps to a dog is not so
much that it's insulting to the chef but
that dog shouldn't be eating human
leftovers because it's not the dog body
is not meant to break it down
that's correct I always thought it was
like an insult to the cook but actually
it's because dogs are like allergic to
stuff and also get diarrhea
I've been dating Jay for four months
he's handsome smart funny well-educated
has an awesome job and is a sweetheart
Sunday he had a whole day planned for us
we were going to walk a nature trail
don't go back to his place for a dinner
he was making I was so excited because
it was going to be the first time I'd be
at his house
since we were hiking he said I could
bring my dog Shelby with us
he made us a roast and some vegetables I
finished my plate before Jay did and
took it to the kitchen there was still
about half the roast left and it was
close to Shelby's dinner time so I took
half the roast and some still raw
vegetables from the fridge to put on a
plate for Shelby
you took half of you took a quarter of
the roast feed it to your dog
half of the half he took a quarter a
quarter of the roast
that's a okay I'm mad I'm mad
that could have been leftovers
because that could have been his dinner
tomorrow night and the night after the
night after that that he could have been
slicing that up for sandwiches and
taking them to work or something like
that
like a little piece of the table scrap
sure like I thought she'd give them like
you know a little like a piece of meat
did she put the
the
demi-glaze on top of it did she do a
balsamic reduction
anyway sorry yeah that's not table
scraps that [ __ ] came from the kitchen
that's a plate house
they're not scraps if they if you have
to slice them off the damn filet
that's how they serve you in a
restaurant
anyway I was carrying the plate to the
back door with Shelby the feeder outside
Jay asked me what I was doing I told
them I'm feeding Shelby Jay said
something like well that's not dog food
Jay knows I mainly feed Shelby a raw
diet yeah roast is not raw so I don't
see how that's relevant
I mean it's named after the manner of
cooking
keep reading okay I trust you
Jay knows I mainly feed Shelby a raw
diet I open the door to put the plate
down for Shelby and Jay got up took the
plate away from her went to the kitchen
came back with it wrapped up in tin foil
and told me to leave his excuse was he
made dinner for me and him not me him
and my dog and that I should have asked
him before I helped myself since he
would have used his leftovers
I did leave but not before telling him
he made the meal for us so I could do
with some of it as I pleased and he knew
damn well how I feed shell would he was
not raw food
I don't I mean he's kind of crazy for
being like you gotta go but also they've
only been dating for four months so I
feel like you know if you've only been
dating for four months maybe you see
like one red flag and you're like
you hit the emergency eject button
you're like I'm out this
and he's like I'm you know get out of my
our apartment or something like that
sure but they've been dating for four
months maybe he's like I'm I see where
this is going and I honestly I'm gonna
have to hit the next button
maybe assuming this is real
I did leave but not before telling him
he made the meal for us so I could do
with some of it as I please he knew damn
well how I feed Shelby I tried talking
to my friend about it later that night
she said Jay was right to be upset but
this friend has never really approved of
how I treat my own dog I asked a friend
about it then they told me the answer
um and it wasn't an answer I was looking
to hear so I just discounted what they
said because they never agree with me
anyway
um so why did I come talk to them in the
first place I don't know
I feel like she was probably a bit
biased and the wrong person to ask am I
the [ __ ] for just feeding my dog like
I normally would clarification many
people are calling me one of History's
Greatest monsters I would like to come
back and defend myself a little bit she
does not get restaurant Food daily I eat
out maybe four times a month if what I
eat is dog safe or if the restaurant
makes food for dogs on request then I
bring some home for her
is there anything you can do
it's just it's an honest question
you can be at a restaurant and be like I
have a request do you make dog food here
it's next to the kids menu
some restaurants I'm not I told you I'm
not a dog person I don't know
it does sound like an insult
yes I'll have the um I'll have the
tenderloin cooked
medium please and also if you bring out
a side of dog food
no no it's not for me to eat it's for my
dog
that's what my dog to consume
sorry
Shelby's daily meals are a bit of brown
rice raw vegetables ground chicken
hearts and beef livers the hearts and
livers are boiled just enough to kill
bacteria and that is all with the
approval of Shelby's vet I asked Jay how
he prepared the roast so I couldn't know
if it's safe to give her that's also why
I got her fresh unused vegetables from
the fridge
update I accept on the [ __ ] for what
I said and did to Jay some of the
responses were harsh but I see now why I
was entitled thanks to people who
responded to others going on about her
diet thanks for the concern but I came
here to ask about Jay not to get into a
debate about dog foods Shelby's been on
a diet for six years and is a healthy
and active pupo that's all in my vet
need to know
as for Jay I apologize he did accept my
apology but he broke it off he said that
was the last straw for him over me doing
things without asking first he's talked
to me about taking things off his plate
or his drink without asking before I've
tried to do better but kept slipping up
that's hard
that's one it's like quitting smoking
trying to stop
taking someone's drink or taking food
off their plate without asking for it
first it's just one of those things it's
tough to
it's a tough nut to crack honestly
I I didn't realize I was this bad so I'm
gonna work on myself for the next guy
for people that said not going to his
place for four months it's a red flag
that was my decision that he respected I
don't want to go to someone's house or
them know where I live the first few
months of dating and getting to know
each other I mean that's fine but
young people are so funny
sorry this is really insulting through
tears I guess I just need to work on
myself a little bit I really got to stop
stealing food off of his plate without
having the decency to ask first
it's just so hard I've just I've really
got some soul searching to do I've I've
got to figure out what's so wrong with
me that I will take sips of someone's
drink without asking
what's am I so broken
anyway I mean
this is like pretty minor
in the whole scheme of things but very
funny maybe because it's minor
you know what you're right we should
read the comments on this one because
the situation is so minor that I bet the
comments are insane
it's the way it tends to go
if op is not insane and the person the
post is about is not insane the comments
pick up the mantle
the real problem with this lady she you
know overstepped her bounds a little bit
needs to learn to ask first no big deal
I don't care what she feeds her dog I'm
not a veterinarian
yes you're the [ __ ]
you're now ex-boyfriend why you got to
put the own in there come on
she's already hurting you don't have to
add like a little salt-based sprinkle on
top of it your now ex-boyfriend made a
special meal for you you took a large
hunk of that special meal and gave it to
your dog not only that but you did so
knowing it would upset your now
ex-boyfriend you should have brought dog
food to feed Shelby okay that's true you
should have not failed fed Shelby with
people food and you should not have fed
your dog with a special dinner you're
now egg your triple you triple down
boyfriend prepared for you it is wholly
irrelevant that Jane knows you mainly
feed Shelby a raw diet I mean that is
true
also the title of your post is
misleading table scraps are what's left
over on your plate after you finish
eating they are not a quarter of the
roast your boyfriend prepared this is
this is all very true but it's given
with a certain sheldonian cooperesque
air
let's just say it's maybe a little bit
too harsh
anyway I don't know why it became an
argument about inflation right after I
guess you haven't been grocery shopping
lately roasts are expensive groceries in
general are expensive you didn't even
bother to ask if you minded you are
entitled to food you didn't pay for or
make that's not correct she is entitled
to food she didn't pay for if this
dude's like come over to my house I
cooked you dinner she's entitled to that
food she's probably not entitled to take
a quarter of it and feed it to her dog
but at the same time like this is just
insane so now you've gone too far now
ever can I have another bite can I have
another bite and do it in his head 35
cents 70 cents
Buckle five buck 40.
he's like what am I getting out of this
deal holy cow she's eating like six
bucks worth of Chuck
the chicanery yes op also helped herself
to the veggies in his fridge even
veggies have gone up in price
no [ __ ]
it's just like what are is am I on r
slash stocks r slash uh Frugal like
I just don't understand
yeah and you're sitting in a chair in
his apartment and you didn't even
contribute to the rent and do you know
how much rent has gone up owner
equivalent rent no less like it's just
anyway sorry
at my boyfriend's place it's completely
normal for me to eat snacks and stuff
without asking but the first time I was
there I hesitated to even get a glass of
water
come on
oh so snacks are okay
veggies cross the line but you're
telling me that the price of potato
chips has not gone up uh nine percent
year over year
enjoying his air conditioning yeah
sleeping on his bed with the sheets that
he washed with the Tide Pods he paid for
it like it's just you're right but
you're going way too far like you're
going you're going too granular for no
reason
like you can be in the wrong without
having to drag economics into it
I love the chicanery by the way you're
the [ __ ] a quarter of a roast is not
table scraps how was the fact that you
mainly feed your feed your dog a raw
diet relevant also holy entitlement
Batman user received gold for this post
you made dinner for me so I can do with
it as I please by that logic it would
have been perfectly acceptable to flush
it down the toilet okay see that's
that's better and then this is
what second poster always takes it too
far yeah and use the dude's plate
he wrapped up the whole plate and gave
it to her yeah and he's doing the food
is one thing but he also had the food on
a dish
he's crazy man and he used his own
energy that he paid for food to feed
into himself so it could be metabolized
in the ATP to provide energy to hold the
plate and she didn't even contribute
you're the [ __ ] half the roast
let me introduce you to this New Concept
called leftovers it's this amazing thing
where you eat some food later
or the next day holy [ __ ]
ten times redditers
blew out the op of an am I the [ __ ]
post
why are you just you're fishing for
cheap owns here
when op said table scraps I thought it
was food they left unfinished on the
table not half a pot roast in the fridge
that's so many new meals from that half
pot roast sandwiches tortilla Pizza
tacos Etc
tortilla Pizza
this is the second thing on the list
tortilla Pizza
um huh
it sounds like a chimney meal
I'm not saying it's not real
you're the [ __ ] veggies are
chickpeanor imagine spending a couple
hours making a nice meal they've raid
your fridge take a bunch of food for a
little doggy bag op should post this
dude's phone number are you crazy
it's a crime you're the [ __ ] that's
not a raw diet you're pumping your dog
full of salt and harmful chemicals by
feeding her a roast
oh man
bra a quarter of the roast isn't table
scraps I thought you were going to let
the dog lick your plate or something
okay so this sounds crazy
I think I would rather she took a
quarter of the if I was in this
situation I would rather she lets the
dog take a quarter of the roast than let
the dog lick her plate I gotta wash that
with my hands man
just like some dog saliva on top I don't
know I guess if they eat it off the
plate they're going to get the dog
saliva on it to begin with I don't know
I just feel weird about it I know the
vegetables are expensive or whatever but
I would
just feel weird about it
I don't know I don't support we'd love
to know your thoughts on this
okay here's one that this is coming up
after this one am I the [ __ ] for
refusing to pay my gay son's tuition
after he came out to his family
I'd love to see how you're going to
bring that one back I think that's
pretty the title itself is pretty cut
and dry
anyway sorry
let me I'm I'm gonna guess before we
read it that it's like I'm not
homophobic but my parents are a little
old-fashioned they have Traditional
Values and really support small
government so I would have just
preferred if he kept his true self a
secret but then he went against my words
while having the audacity to do it in a
house that I pay for so I cut him off he
turns 18 in six months am I the [ __ ]
that's what I'm ex that's what I'm
expecting and I could be wrong but
I could be wrong
am I the [ __ ] for making my husband
fly coach well I flew first class I'm
gonna my initial judgment and I'm glad
that this is not how the legal system
works is that you can't be an [ __ ] in
this situation because it's very funny
this is this is a humorous situation I
would have a sense of humor about it
if honestly
if we were flying somewhere and Kate was
like I want to fly first class
there's a genuine chance that I might be
like you know what
to save like 1500 bucks you fly first
class I'll be hanging up I'll be hanging
out on coach
doesn't bother me
we're watching the same movies you'll be
you're renting a nicer chair I've flown
first class
two times it was on the same trip
they were short flights it was nice to
get unlimited wine and and snacks and A
light meal but
it's like this isn't worth a thousand
dollars are you crazy
I'm watching X-Men apocalypse on a on a
3.2 inch screen it's not that big of a
deal you enjoy the first class on this
and with no resentment you enjoy the
first class
I'll be in coach I'll be wedged in the
middle seat for six hours I'll be
watching some six out of ten Jason
Siegel movie and we'll arrive at the
same location fifteen hundred dollars
richer
yeah plus we can still text we could
play chess over the in-flight
Entertainment System
anyway sorry
my husband's company recently chose him
to attend the conference in Miami they
chose him in a few of his co-workers out
of a ton of candidates so it was quite
the honor the company told them they
were allowed to bring their spouses but
they wouldn't be springing for plane
tickets so if they wanted to bring us
they'd have to buy tickets out of their
own Pockets my husband asked me if I
wanted to go and I told him that I did
I'd never been to Florida in my life and
I thought it would be a fun trip he told
me great when we went to the website he
asked if I'd be okay flying coach even
though he'd be flying first class on the
way there coach on the way home I asked
him why we couldn't just fly together he
replied first class is so expensive I
feel bad but we just can't afford it
especially if we want to go out and have
fun in Miami the flight's only a few
hours this really really bothered me I
understood a first class ticket for me
would strain our budget a bit but what
kind of a man lives it up lives It Up In
First Class
well his wife sits in coach I asked him
just that and he responded come on I'm
taking you along with my work trip I
earned my first class seat by working
hard it's my reward but I insisted if we
truly couldn't afford a first class seat
for me
that he is a gentleman should give up
his seat for me we argued But ultimately
he agreed to give me his seat of course
he did
clearly he's an educated guy he's a good
earner he's not an idiot of course he
lost that argument
we had a good time in Miami but he's
been a little mad at me since saying
that I earned his first class seat that
it was free and cost us nothing unlike
my plane ticket and that I should have
just let him enjoy what he'd earned
instead of guilting him out of it I
think he's being a baby he should have
put his wife's Comfort above his own
especially since he made the choice to
be cheap we're very close to his parents
so we've taken the argument to them for
mediation but they are split his father
agrees with me that he wasn't being a
gentleman well his mother thinks he
earned his first class seed and that I
should have let him have it I'll ask all
of you am I the [ __ ] bro who [ __ ]
cares
it was like a two hour flight in a
comfier chair you guys got problems get
over it this is not that big of a deal
dude honestly I'm she is my King Solomon
instinct is that obviously on a
principal level she's wrong
he earned the first class ticket by
working
the the ticket was given to him if she
wants to come along and they can't
afford a second first class ticket she
should fly coach because he earned the
free ticket okay on as a as a human
being who you know is in a relationship
who's married
this husband has got to get his head out
of his ass
you should be sitting and coaching
you're like holy cow I get like
especially if they had kids this this
would never come up because he would be
like holy [ __ ] three hours to myself
no I want to sit in first class no
please no okay fine you take I guess
I'll be the bigger man you take it I'll
be back there
can I have some more pretzels and hummus
please can I be uh
can I watch two in-flight movies at the
same time can I take a little bit of a
nap I would be
I would be pogging
I'd be living a life I don't care if I'm
I'd be making friends in the middle seat
it just doesn't seem like this is that
big of a deal and maybe maybe you could
I mean there's so many obvious
situations here
that could their Solutions
maybe she takes first class on the way
down you take first class on the way
back that's like a literal King solemn
and you're completely fair or maybe you
just [ __ ] nut up and take the coach
seat even though you're in the wrong
because it's the easiest way to solve
the problem and then you get back at her
by ordering more in-flight beverages
judgment free
and then when you get off she'll be like
how many Heinekens did you have and you
just [ __ ] lie you just be like two
she could be like seven who knows I
don't know how long the flight is
this is a secret
to a happy life
I'm just doing so many different ways
that you could get through this without
it now you've dragged in the older
generation to have theirs say this is
not going to end well this is not like a
real problem
then I'm like I'm mad at the husband
because there's so many different ways
you could play this
you like if he was like this is how you
know he's never seen Game of Thrones
because if he if he knew who
Littlefinger was he would have he would
have said so I offered to take the coach
seat knowing that if they ever got in a
dispute over it anyway she's gonna win
the argument and he's gonna end up
taking the coach seat he should have
offered it to begin with this gives him
some soft power that he's used to
improve perception around him which
allows him to then exert his will in a
different context maybe he gets to
choose some restaurants you know as a
result of that and not even like in a
contractual swap but just because you've
created an environment where you know
he's more respected as a result because
he made a concession willfully instead
of having to fight for it even though
he's in the right
foreign
I also I don't know if I can leave if I
can read the comments on this one
because I think that I'm going to lose
my mind because I know people are going
to get lost in the damn weeds
people are going to be like well he
earned it so technically he should be
sitting up there that's true but at the
same time the [ __ ] husband should be
like you know what you're right enjoy
yours giving your wife a first class
ticket
is uh it's going to have knock-on
effects that are going to make your life
better as well
and the knock-on effects are probably
going to be better for you than sitting
in a more comfortable chair and drinking
like three bottomless mimosas or
something like that I know that the
principal is she's wrong on principle
but something if you never read
diplomacy by Henry Kissinger have you
listen dragon out of whiteboard this is
Nicolo Machiavelli Nickelodeon Valley
wrote a novel in the 15th century called
the prince with the prince they said
never let a good crisis go to waste and
then you gotta you don't understand okay
mm-hmm
okay sorry I'm scrolling down here
you're the [ __ ] his company copped
the first class ticket for him what kind
of wife insists her husband give up the
ticket while his company
but give up the ticket his company paid
for on his behalf so she could live it
up a little why don't you cover the cost
difference of first class yourself okay
again like right
but see see how far you get in life
being right all the time and and railing
for it
see how far you get with this attitude
simple she is selfish entitled
manipulative greedy a meme person this
post is like 500 Words man you don't
know what the hell you're talking about
if you are she's spelled the things
they're wrong [ __ ] your dude
it's got 20 000 upvotes user received
gold and deleted their post
for this
um uh if you're going to be financially
strapped by buying a first class ticket
then the reality is you cannot afford it
and are trying to live above your means
okay
so what
I mean like I I don't know what the
point like what does it have to do with
who cares who asked well you did in
order to rule on this you need to know
their exact monthly budget
I hate to then just you see here's the
thing for some reason we've been raised
in this culture to believe that saving
money is is a moral good in spending
money is a moral evil is if there's some
kind of ethical concern and then we got
it on it
get me out of here
next post you're the [ __ ] what kind
of wife puts her Comfort above that of
her husband's
this is not a husband wife thing
I think a lot of people put their own
Comfort above the comfort of almost
anybody else a child
different a child sure your own kid
I think a lot of people put their their
own Comfort above the comfort of someone
else
this whiteboard bit is fire okay let's
go you're a hypocrite and you cheated
him out of something he earned and
deserved for have you do you realize
that we got the [ __ ] there's like 10
people in the United States of America
that are that are holding everybody else
down
you'd see they got us fighting over the
damn scraps
first class flight for three hours
everybody's in here like you cost him a
once in a lifetime experience you see
that we're we're all out here in the
rabble
punching each other in the face for just
uh just things they're casting off from
the high table
sitting in a slightly more comfortable
chair in the sky
while they feed you like a meal of sous
vide salmon or something like that
because you know they're not sauteing
that [ __ ] God there's no there's no open
the heat on the airplane
[ __ ] is all microwaved in like an
aluminum bag back at the terminal
they got you turning on each other
when you should be turning on the people
that make the first class tickets so
expensive in the first place
offer a hand they'll take an arm why are
you bringing like the
Acts of Apostles into this what are you
talking about
you're not you're the [ __ ] not so
much for this seat situation more for
your whole outlook on this Venture this
was his moment his trip he wanted to
share that with you but it seems like
that in and of itself wasn't good enough
for you
he offered to take you
to the real estate notary public
convention 2022
in Sarasota Springs
his moment
and you took your pants off and took a
[ __ ] on his Mo look she's in the wrong I
I just need to keep coming back to that
because on a principle like a
pseudo-legal level is if I was an
independent arbiter
the first thing I would say is are you
sure you want to do this [ __ ] over this
then the second thing is I would say he
gets the seat
because he it's his comp ticket from his
work but then I would we I'm just
zipping up in the bathroom urinal and
then he comes in I would be like brother
just one more time are you sure you want
to be here is it really worth it
and then it's his it's his choice from
that point onwards but
if if he doesn't respond to the men's
room arbitration then then I've got to
issue a legally binding decision but
still
you're the [ __ ] I'm surprised you
think you're not here if you're sticking
to outdated gender Norms of a gentleman
who gives up a seat for his lady then do
you also fetch him his slippers and a
stiff drink when you get home wearing
your when he gets home wearing your best
lipstick why is he am I
losing the ability to read am I losing
comprehension where does he work he's
wearing his wife's lipstick
what's going on here I'm confused
he's 100 right he earned that seat his
work gifted in first class because of
his work not yours the fact that he even
agreed to allow you to do this shows
what a good person he is but it's the is
that the least you could do but it's
like
he did he didn't really do anything
go honestly
I I don't know I feel a little crazy
because I've flown first class and it's
better
but it's not like
flying first class is like you're on
Soul Plane and then flying in coach is
like you know you're on like uh the
Trans-Siberian Express in the 1800s or
something like that like it's
there's a difference I'm just saying
it's not that big of a deal
so I would promptly apologize for acting
spoiled if I was in your position and
perhaps you could give up something you
love for his benefit sometime and you
think I'm the King Solomon here
now she's got a you if you want to make
this whole
put your Blu-ray of Sex in the City
season two in the paper shredder
oh you don't love me
no
that was the season they introduced
you're the [ __ ] he earned that you
sound entitled that's true
me and my girlfriend would be the same
excuse me
getting her to get the better half of
something is frustratingly difficult
sometimes okay keep bragging you sound
like Patton Oswald hey that reminds me
of a joke my wife is so hot
[Laughter]
sorry
okay op disappeared after posting I'd
love to hear an update well of course
after seeing all these you're the
[ __ ] responses
op realized her ploy to gather support
has been foiled so it's time to
disappear now
this [ __ ] sounds like a Batman script
I'd love for the update to say something
like my husband met his true love and
Coach who's not a greedy jerk and now
I'm divorced saneest redditor of all
time
I wonder if they if they actually made
that post am I the [ __ ] for leaving
my wife or someone I met on a two-hour
flight to Miami
I think people would be like you're the
[ __ ] she chose to build her life
around you and then you just go and
throw it away for a cheap fling oh but
she made me sit and Coach oh oh delete
the gym tan the Facebook and uh do your
laundry
this one's a little spicy this one's
from earlier
am I the [ __ ] for refusing to pay my
gay son's tuition after he came out to
his family
we'll see if my prediction is correct my
son came out to my husband when he was
14 years old my husband and I are both
atheists and support the lgbtq plus
community in all ways except the
financial and we're both proud of our
son for coming out however my son here
we go my husband's mother is a devout
Catholic and is extremely intolerant of
gay people she is wealthy and my
children were told from a young age
their college would be paid for as long
as they attended a private Christian or
Catholic school she believes this will
keep them from partying having
premarital sex
well yeah but they'll get married when
they're like 18. so it's kind of like a
loophole right
like that's I don't know if that's I
think you like contractually speaking I
think they fulfill the obligations but
I'm not trying to judge I'm just saying
I'm not flaming I'm just saying
I don't agree with this and I've argued
my children getting the best education
possible regardless of the school's
religious affiliation should be your top
priority wait this is the grandparents
that are trying to exert their will well
that's tough luck for them because
they're not the parents or the kid in
the first place
this is like that that image that's like
I consent I consent
didn't wasn't there someone you forgot
to ask and then it's like Jesus Christ
except it's like a picture of their
their grandpa or something like that
I love memes well me too bad memes
they're just the more efficient means of
information transferred than words
sometimes
anyway he graduated with a lot of
college
I'm going backwards
um she refuses to change her mind my son
chose a Christian College one state over
to attend he graduated with a lot of
college credit from taking many AP
classes and will be done in three years
as opposed to four he's currently just
began year two which has already been
paid for during Labor Day weekend he
came home to celebrate his grandma's
birthday he told one of his cousins he
was talking to a boy at his college and
thought he could trust him he seemed
supportive according to my son but he
told
his mom and dad and my husband's sister
and her husband are just real as
religious as my mother-in-law and outed
my son to her okay so the family has a
has a narc they got a snitch she's livid
and called me and informed me she will
not be making any future payments
towards his tuition and told me to relay
the message to him and she will no
longer be speaking to him uh world's
worst grandma in history
excuse me grandma I believe there's a
mug you should be returning to me right
now
I'm gonna need to go back I need to take
that mug back to Sears what's the refund
window like
she's livid okay I've told him many
times not to come out to his grandma
cousins aunt or Uncle until he was
through with college I hate that he
can't be himself with my husband and I
can't afford his college I don't like my
mother-in-law and we'll be going no
contact once my other two children get
their chance to have their tuition paid
for it as well
it's pragmatic
it's very economical
there's two ways to look at it she's uh
one way the unfavorable way is that
she's casting her principles aside in
order to suckle on the tip of hatred the
other way is that she's draining money
out of the coffers of a
of a position she doesn't agree with and
then as soon as it no longer benefits
her she's out no either way you could
frame it either way I think
my son is okay with me wanting to do
this for the sake of his siblings he
will unfortunately have to take out
student loans and eat the cost of his
final Year my son is obviously
devastated he both will not have his
final year of college paid for and that
his cousin is not someone he can trust
he now wants me and my husband to foot
the bill next year we have 25k saved up
currently that we plan on using for
much-needed kitchen renovations our oven
barely works our dishwasher doesn't work
at all and the kitchen itself is worn
down and outdated my son is calling me
an [ __ ] for prioritizing a remodel
over his education we've explained to
him our kitchen is falling apart it's
much needed and is nowhere near the cost
of his tuition so even if we postponed
it we would still be short as his
private school is very expensive I feel
like he's an adult and he needs to be
the one to deal with the consequences
not us
what are the hell are you talking about
the consequences you gotta hey you're
old enough to deal with the consequences
of you realizing that your grandma is a
homophobe
it's time you take responsibility for
your role in this situation
am I the [ __ ] for not using our
families savings to cover his remaining
tuition I feel like I should clear up
the kitchen remodel obviously appliances
alone aren't going to cost 25 000 the
majority of the money is going to
necessary infrastructure repairs I live
in an expensive area and yes this is
what it costs to fix fix just the
Necessities my kitchen will in no way be
fancy I should have been more clear in
the original post that I'm not doing a
remodel for Aesthetics
um
this is a tough one because like
you're not the biggest [ __ ] in the
story that's for sure
the Grandma's definitely like the
biggest [ __ ]
I don't think there's any doubt about
that
I don't know man I'm like
listen
it's not a situation you want to be in
we got it
kitchen remodel versus one year of
student loans it sounds like their
kitchen doesn't really work that well
I it doesn't seem like they're getting
their redone for an HGTV shoot or
something like that just to flex some
kind of domestic opulence
it's an unfortunate situation I wouldn't
I mean I feel like
the Sun
should be mad at the grandma not the mom
that's my take on it
we had a whole
engagement set up here it fell apart for
horrible reasons that's not the mom
didn't play any role and for the record
neither did the sun sun shouldn't have
to hide who he is in order to uh get
free college right
the grandma is the big [ __ ] there's
no doubt about that
it's just a bad situation I don't know I
say [ __ ] get the
to do the remodel
student loans are [ __ ] up though
do you believe that student loans were
like eight percent when the FED fund
rate was a quarter of a single percent
that [ __ ] doesn't make any sense at all
how did they get that's like uh
that's like a rent to own
furniture store I didn't even I can't
believe that it's legal in the first
place
you should see it now I guess that's a
good point
I don't know it's just a messed up
situation
shouldn't it be like tied to the FED
funds rate or like
there dare I say if if you feel like
it's a good thing for your
country both economically from a
tax-based standpoint but also from like
a we have to live here standpoint it's a
good thing for society to be as educated
as possible and maybe offer it
interest-free
in Europe they're like interest-free how
about like tuition free but listen we
got to take it like one step at a time
okay
interest free is not a free loan it's
just a cheap loan that you you borrow X
and you pay back X
sorry I said borrow funny
I don't even think I need to read the
comments on this one the comments on
this one are just gonna make me mad
have you considered a new kitchen look
if she was like my kitchen's functional
but I wanna I want new cabinets I would
be like you got to pay the tuition you
gotta own that but if if she's like none
of my [ __ ] works I'm like okay you need
a dishwasher like live a little
read them evil Kermit
you're the [ __ ] but not for not being
able to afford it but for saying it was
his fault he lost the money yes okay
that is true
I would agree with that and I don't
think we need to read it anymore
not the [ __ ] in truth the problem is
your bigoted mother-in-law so true
info how are you going to deal with
future holidays I'm just going to be
honest with you I don't care
your title is high key BS he didn't come
out to his family he came out to the one
person he thought he could trust that
that person outed him
to everyone else overall I have to say
no [ __ ] here okay except for the
grandma okay it's understandable you
didn't want to dump your savings and
it's understandable that he's upset
about losing out on his college what the
hell actual sane redditors in the in the
comments for this one
hold on I need the F5 to get endless
scroll back
I am scrolling I am scrolling I am

am I the [ __ ]
for telling my fiance he embarrassed me
when he started singing happy birthday
to his five-year-old son at the
restaurant
what the hell
now ex-grandma
anyway let's check it why not if the
title got me I can't deny it
I have been with my fiance Ned for a
year and a half he has a five-year-old
son with his ex-girlfriend they don't
have a custody Arrangement but he has
him most of the week because the mom is
currently sick his son is lovely but I
notice Ned takes him everywhere he goes
including places that aren't child
friendly we have an issue with that
because we're working on it but we're
working on it his son's fifth birthday
was days ago Ned took us out to a
restaurant to celebrate the place was
nice and looked a bit unfitting for the
occasion because it was a somewhat
expensive place okay it's understandable
you take your five-year-old kid to a
fancy restaurant
it's a little atypical
anyways we ordered food then got the
birthday cake which was a surprise
because I thought we were going to
celebrate at home so we could be free to
sing and play however we wanted I still
had no issue until Ned started singing
Happy Birthday why why are they calling
it the Happy Birthday song
it's not the hap it's happy birthday
I know it's like there's a legal
distinction but we're not in court right
now like it's just
the way they keep saying the Happy
Birthday song is throwing me for a loop
we are okay react court it's like Judge
Judy okay it's non-binding arbitration
we say it's real people real cases what
we don't say is real judgments okay
I was stunned I was so stunned I almost
dropped my plate he was singing it at
the top of his lungs not even looking
around or paying attention to how many
people staring at us awkwardly I felt so
embarrassed I kept Whispering for him to
stop but he ignored me of course my
future stepson was hyped and a little
too active which isn't good when we're
in a public place I expected the staff
the manager anyone involved to stop him
but no one did in fact someone came up
to us and offered that she'd help us
take a video recording I wasn't in it at
all I froze in my seat looking stunned
and a little angry
like I understand where she's coming
from from the perspective of like um you
know if you're at a semi fancy
restaurant or fancier than that there's
not this kind of situation where people
come out and go like
happy birthday little Olive Garden you
know like it's not typical but at the
same time I think that the restaurant is
still full of human beings
and they would see someone singing happy
birthday and they wouldn't like be like
what they would be like oh it's a kid's
birthday party they're just gonna sing
happy birthday for five seconds and then
we'll get back to eating like the steak
tartar or whatever like it's not that
anyone that comes up to the manager and
is like you need to comp our meal
because we were disturbed by that
five-year-old's birthday party song
you're like you gotta chill out that
person's the [ __ ]
anyway he looked at me later asking what
was wrong I didn't say anything except
for thanks for finally noticing he
didn't understand what I meant and I
didn't explain until we were in the car
I flat out told him he was in he
embarrassed me the second he started
singing in the restaurant
his greatest communication skills yes
thanks for finally noticing
I told him we could have done this at
home and we'd be more comfortable and
free he took it as in I was ashamed of
him and his son but I denied it and said
that it just felt awkward and
embarrassing because I've never been in
this situation and also judging from the
restaurant we were at he said his son's
mom is sick he's trying to do all he can
to cheer him up and that all families do
that and no one had an issue except me
and when I tried to explain he got mad
when I tried to explain why I was mad he
had the audacity to experience the
equivalent emotion
and said he no longer felt like talking
when I gave him the silent treatment
without telling him how I felt in the
first place that was okay but after he
told me how he felt and then he didn't
want to talk anymore that's too far
we haven't been speaking since then it
appears he's still salty about me oh man
he's still salty about me saying what I
said and inciating that I see him and
his son as an embarrassment am I the
[ __ ] I think he's being too harsh on
the whole thing would love to know your
thoughts on this oh man
yeah what
welcome to like having a child
you're gonna be like embarrassed in
public you just gotta get over it
you're carrying like a a little person
around it's like crap in their pants and
drooling touching stuff they're not
supposed to touch saying stuff they're
not supposed to say hearing stuff
they're not supposed to hear and then
repeat it and then you know
most sane people would look at a
situation like this and be like oh
five-year-old birthday party that's cute
they might even clap along with the song
or clap when the song is over
um
you on the other hand are a crazy person
um like what's wrong with you
I think it's okay like
it's okay to be awkward that they're
singing happy birthday at the restaurant
but who asked people feel awkward every
day
just because you experience an emotion
it doesn't need to be like a big fight
just be like I felt awkward at the
restaurant Yum Yum Cake go home that was
fun
good night I love you like what's the
what's the problem I don't understand
the issue
like why why is there a little worm in
your brain turning around this this
issue over and over
doesn't make any sense
so I say that you are the [ __ ] not
your your emotional reaction to the
Happy Birthday song is whatever you know
it happens but then like being a
being a an a-hole to your husband
afterwards saying things like thanks for
finally noticing and then being mad
after he tries to pull the same thing on
you is insanity you're the [ __ ] for
sure
he gleefully I see this person in every
thread man this is getting scary
he gleefully sang Happy Birthday to his
child whose mother is sick well you sat
there sulking in your anger
are you applying to be an evil
stepmother by any chance you prioritize
not being embarrassed over a fun moment
between a father and a son the
restaurant staff didn't think it was
inappropriate it doesn't seem like
you're a good match for someone with
kids you're the [ __ ] user received
Reddit comment for this post
true though
it's not embarrassing they sing Happy
Birthday to a child it is however super
embarrassing to look pissed off at a
person singing happy birthday to a child
at the same table as you you're the
[ __ ] like I'm lose I'm a fairly
reserved person
I'll be in the grocery store with my
kids crying we're singing Love is an
open door it's not necessary I mean like
in the worst possible interpretation
you're like oh this is disturbing the
people around me but I'm like yeah but
I'm like placating uh toddler so like
you're an adult you've got the emotional
toolbox to like get over it you've even
got earbuds in right now
like it's just it's the way it goes
sometimes kids are going to do like some
stuff in public that is disturbing to
other people I know not disturbing you
know like hereditary but disturbing like
ah and then you just you know
you don't see a parent like
comforting their child and go like could
you do that quieter you go okay I have
some sympathy for that situation and I'm
you know an adult I'm just gonna go get
my
my crispy Minis and get in line you know
it's just weird
like if I could get her to stop I would
have done it by now if
if it was that easy if I could just be
like oh sorry can you stop freaking out
but in this environment that you're
completely unfamiliar with
if I just ah can you can you just like
delay this
temper tantrum until we get home she'd
be like oh okay sure no problem why
didn't I think of that
anyway
I agree with with cool Lama you're the
[ __ ] the kid is five actually true
it sounds like if you if it were up to
you you'd leave him in a car and crack a
window okay I don't know if I go that
far necessarily
this is maybe a little too far at least
they cracked the window
I was stunned I almost dropped my plate
why were you holding a plate Aloft it's
the small details that make me question
the veracity of a story
it's like a
film Noir private eye
the streets of Reddit are crawling with
calamari
you can't even shake a stick without
hitting the fake post that has 20 000
comments on it
I can't do a saxophone sound but you get
the idea
somebody's got to sniff this out
what does this even say
am I the [ __ ] for telling my husband
I was inviting my brother for dinner and
telling my brother my husband wouldn't
be home
am I the [ __ ] for telling my husband
that I was inviting my brother for
dinner
and telling my brother
my husband wouldn't be home
am I the [ __ ] for not telling my
husband I was inviting my brother to
dinner
and telling my brother my husband
wouldn't be home uh
uh me
husband
brother
dinner
home question mark question mark
question mark
it does sound like she's gonna blank her
brother's blank doesn't it she's gonna
cook her brother's dinner
I don't know why you're being so weird
about it
hold on I'm trying to find a good one to
send us here
am I the [ __ ] for suggesting my
stepdaughter is overreacting over her
milk
it's a lot of not the [ __ ] I don't
know why you would ever comment on a not
the [ __ ] post like time is
time is more valuable than that here we
go here we go would I be the [ __ ] if
I kick my daughter out of the house for
not turning appliances off
it's got everything
parental negligence teenage entitlement
real estate castle doctrine
it might be the [ __ ] if I kick my
daughter out for not turning appliances
off throw away a little background
information I had my daughter while I
was still in college my parents felt I
was too young to and two broke the razor
so they raised her they took on the
roles of her parents and
her father has never been in the picture
so I was grateful and although she knows
I'm her mother she sees me as a sister
I try my best to make sure she lives
comfortably and has everything she needs
but really there's only so much I can do
since my parents are capable enough and
I appreciate them
okay
who establishes a complicated start
the conflict started when she came to
stay over at my place two weeks ago to
try to bond his mother and daughter I'll
be honest I've always wanted this but
she didn't what a [ __ ] my daughter
my daughter who uh I didn't really raise
and the grandparents raised her who is
also uh 16 didn't want a relationship
with me yet
not my fault what could I do I did
everything I conceived I delivered
I've held up my end of the bargain
she only came because my parents asked
her to she's a darling for the most part
but she leaves every Appliance she uses
on if she enters a room and turns on the
lights she'll leave it on too
we need more info is she like leaving
the fridge open is she leaving the stove
on if she's leaving because your example
is the lights it's like the most
innocuous
Appliance to leave on
it would be better if they weren't left
on but at the same time like that's
that's not that big of a deal
it's quite irritating but we welcome to
living with other people like much less
a teenager and I tried to talk to her
about it she laughed it off every time
and told stories about her bad memory
and what she forgot to turn off at
so-and-so's House part of me thinks
she's doing it to vex me
I honestly have no problem turning
lights off when she leaves rooms but my
house is never lacking in kids
I have none myself apart from my
daughter
oh man what a great sentence
she's like I shouldn't be responsible
for these kids I don't have any except
for this one but
um except for my daughter but my friends
and neighbors often drop theirs over for
me to watch them and I love them
yesterday my daughter went out with
friends and left the electric iron on
and I only found out when my neighbor's
kid told me the iron is hot okay that's
bad
for sure
that's a bad one
I went off on my daughter when she came
back and reminded her that kids like to
poke at sockets and the iron could have
caused an injury besides it's a fire
hazard she said okay sorry she'd try to
remember only to leave it on again this
morning
she needs to speak with a neurologist
your daughter needs medical attention
this does not sound right
insane take what the iron is a dead I
could the lights are nothing
I leave the lights on sometimes probably
like all the time but I don't want to
say all the time because it makes me
seem like I don't care about planet
Earth okay but I leave the lights on
sometimes sometimes every once in a
while I'll be like click but sometimes I
leave them on
but she this is the iron is serious
business
the plan was to stay for two months it's
only been two weeks but I'm
reconsidering it okay so she's not
kicking her daughter out of her
living situation kind of she's
kicking her daughter out of like a
Airbnb sort of type deal
my friend thinks sending her back will
blow up because this is our only chance
at bonding yeah
so will I be the [ __ ] if I send her
back to my parents and banned her from
my house regardless well you're maybe
the [ __ ] if you kick her out of your
house you're definitely the [ __ ] if
you ban her from your abode
I mean that's like uh that's a step too
far maybe you could just take the iron
away
[Laughter]
kind of 16 year old is ironing two times
in one day to begin with it just doesn't
seem
do you operate like a home laundromat or
something
I don't oh it's oh the hair iron okay
the hair iron I understand
all right I get it
makes more sense to me I wouldn't you're
right I wouldn't get it
ETA info for all those calling me a bad
mother for giving her away this always
happens and I blame Reddit they get lost
in the semantics you know they're like
you're a bad mother for giving her away
20 years ago okay we don't have a
[ __ ] time machine
insolent underscore gamer 1979 like we
gotta do like we're dealing with this
situation at hand we can't go back
in the Tesseract and affect that stuff
okay
now op reads messages that are like
you're a bad person and of course
they're gonna respond to those you know
it's the content creator thing nine
people are like grade stream one person
is like you're a heinous individual you
you light up the person that said you're
a heinous individual even if it's true
you shouldn't say it it's impolite
anyway
it was a whole court case that ruled in
my parents favor because they had money
and I was still in college they've been
great grandparents and they have the
right to decide whether or not I get to
see her and they only allowed me to meet
her when she was 11 and stay with her
recently this is not a good family
situation
you had a bitter court case with your
parents they didn't let you meet your
own daughter until she was 11 years old
something doesn't sound right here
she also doesn't forget anywhere else
just at my place but you're an insane
person as well
you should both see a neurologist you
really think she's she's leaving her
curling iron on to own you I gotta burn
down my mom's house
are you crazy
it's like me being deluded into thinking
that people only run red lights to stop
only me from turning left like it's just
insane you gotta at least acknowledge
that it's insane
everybody's got insane thoughts in their
head I'm sure you just got to be like oh
that was a weird one and then let's get
back to thinking about normal stuff
update thank you for all the comments I
totally see the mistake I was about to
make I also accept my judgment and I'm
going to take responsibility for my
thoughts which I'm glad did not become
actions I spoke to my daughter a while
ago I told her how I genuinely feel
about her and all this and she listened
she didn't say much but she admitted she
doesn't really see me as a mother since
she knew me as a distant sister first so
she didn't know what to do when my
grandparents asked her to come over she
says she's not ready to call me Mom yet
she doesn't think she ever will and she
assumed I would expect her to she's also
upset about me having kids over most of
the time and she feels they shouldn't
get the right to be so close and clingy
to me when she doesn't have that kind of
freedom because again I'm more of a
sister she sees once in a lifetime to
her this all seems fairly Fair
the 16 year I think there's only one
solution the 16 year old is now the mom
and the mom is now the dependent and
we're going to let that ride for a
little bit we're gonna see how that
works out if we have to make some
adjustments we can do that you know on
the Fly
long story short I realized it's going
to be much harder than I ever imagined
but I'll try my best going forth to make
her feel loved and welcome I understand
I should keep my boundaries but in her
words I should stop walking on eggshells
around there too when I will try which I
will try to she didn't promise to do the
same but she did promise to stop doing
things that could cause harm
she promised to stop
forgetting something
no she was doing it on purpose I don't
think that just seems no one no she
wouldn't leave it on on purpose I don't
think so
Burn Down The House on purpose
I just think it's a it's you're setting
yourself up for failure when you say
something like I promise not to forget
something I can't I'll do my best
I don't have control over that it's all
it's meat up here it's wet meat and
electricity
I don't know if I had 100 control over
it I you know I'd be in a different
position in my life
I'd have a I have an eight pack
sometimes you wake up and you're like I
got good intentions and it's like 9 p.m
and you're like I just feel like eating
two kitkats
I'm not saying you shouldn't be held
responsible for your mistakes I'm just
saying you can't promise
that like you will remember something
you could promise to try harder at least
anyway sorry
well on that note I'd like to point out
it's mean of commenters to make
assumptions on something they know
nothing about yes okay it's true but you
don't get to be like I'm not an [ __ ]
because people were rude to me because I
was an [ __ ] in the original post this
is the way this is the way of the world
welcome to the internet
buy a t-shirt
you know what really grinds my gears
anyway slash marker



rumors of Records demise are I've been
greatly over exaggerated check it out
baby instantly into it am I the [ __ ]
for doing the same thing to my
sister-in-law that she does to my son I
guess I would have to say it depends
what the thing is
so background i-32f have a brother Dave
who's married to Sarah they don't have
children yet I have a son who just
turned four and a three-month-old
daughter with my husband 39 M who who
apparently does not get a name my
husband and I live in Belgium most of
the time quit bragging but we travel
back to visit family about once a month
in England at home we speak both English
and French to our children my husband is
Belgian
this [ __ ] is like it's it's too
complicated already the context is out
of control I can't keep this straight
it's like the first episode of rings of
power like come on why don't you why
don't you introduce Gollum
stop talking in in your Hobbit language
about how many wheels of cheese you need
to make it through the winter this year
can I can we get can we get into the
meat of potatoes of the of the social
assassination here
my son is in a very sweet phrase where
sometimes he'll mix up the two languages
and say a couple of words in English in
a French sentence or vice versa
this has never posed a problem to us and
even the staff at his Nursery have
reassured us that it's very common and
they tend to grow out of it yeah he's
he's three years old he's four okay
of course oh what do you mean nobody has
a problem with it oh my child is not
perfectly bilingual at age four of
course no one has a problem with it
nobody cares
my sister-in-law's decided this is a
problem so when we're visiting my
parents she notices my son doing this
she'll correct him but she does she does
so really rudely whereas my husband and
I will just gently correct him anyway
we're visiting at the moment and she's
now decided instead of correcting him
she's just gonna start ignoring him when
he does this I sort of noticed her doing
it when we arrived and I thought it was
odd but assumes maybe she was stressed
because her job is quite intense
but it only really became an issue
yesterday my husband was talking to my
dad outside I was feeding my daughter in
the other room I'd left Lewis with Sarah
and Dave when I came downstairs Louis
was crying and I managed to understand
that he tried to ask Sarah for a drink
he has a special cup he uses that he was
holding so it was obvious what he meant
but that she just ignored him I asked
her why and she explained she wasn't
going to reply to him unless he said the
sentence correctly and then I shouldn't
be ignoring my son's obvious speech
issues for context it's not that she
didn't know what he wanted she told me
that she understood exactly what he was
asking for but that she was deliberately
refusing because he hadn't asked
correctly
this really pissed me off which is very
fair for the record
seems extremely Fair
um
luckily my husband came inside at that
moment and pulled me away so we could
calm down and settle Lewis that night at
the dinner table Sarah asked me to pass
her something but she said it in Bad
English she is English I just mean she
asked for it in slang think pass us the
peas will you I had a bit of an epiphany
and I just decided to totally ignore her
she asked it again and I did the same
thing my brother asked why I was
ignoring his wife I said I'm not able to
reply if she can't speak English
correctly and that it's wrong of him to
ignore her obvious issues with grammar
everyone's pretty pissed off today and I
admit it was incredibly childish but she
was needlessly being a [ __ ] to my
baby should I just apologize no your
base this is the most it's it's so cut
and dry it's boring your sister-in-law
is a real jerk if this is real
why can't people again we're assuming
this is normal or this is real I should
say it's definitely not normal why can't
people just be normal you're having a
family dinner
there's a four-year-old just treat the
four-year-old like a like a part of your
family
I don't understand the
why you would Stonewall a four-year-old
kid because they're not speaking 100
correctly doesn't make any sense
um most real am I the [ __ ] post of
all time
I'm out of here it's too easy
hold on I gotta find something that's uh
I gotta find something that's got some
meat on it so that was just a little
warm up it's a little warm up
how about this one
am I the [ __ ] for dropping my
sister's kids at the child free wedding
that she was at
I'm gonna guess that it's probably uh a
no because it says not the [ __ ] but I
this always starts with like am I the
[ __ ] for violating uh a tenant that
somebody asked me to follow and then
you're like yes and then later they're
like my sister is addicted to crack
cocaine and left her kids with me for 17
days straight and you're like okay you
know what not the [ __ ]
not the [ __ ] do you see the tweet
that was like um
people will write posts that are like am
I the [ __ ] for poisoning my spouse
and then when you read it you're like no
you're not the [ __ ] then if somebody
makes a post that's like am I the
[ __ ] for cooking my wife her favorite
dinner you know you're about to read
some serial killer [ __ ]
it's actually true
if you ever see an MI the [ __ ] post
that's like am I the [ __ ] for doing
an incredibly nice thing you know you're
about to see something written from the
perspective of Jeffrey Dahmer
am I the [ __ ] for dropping my
sister's kids at the child free wedding
she was at
to make a long story short
let's go
sane is most insane redditor to make a
long story short thank you thank you
to make a long story short I am a
medical student my free time is very
limited I have lots of commitments my
sister is three kids all under 10 she
often expects me to babysit for her
which isn't the main problem
but she drops them off at random times
with short notice or no notice at all
okay that is the that's bad the other
day she called saying she was on her way
to drop the kids off at my place because
she was attending her friend's
child-free wedding and couldn't take the
kids with her I had a huge argument with
her on the phone because I had to study
for my upcoming exam next thing I knew
the kids were at my doorstep she was
already back in the car and then drove
off with her husband
I was so pissed I couldn't handle it I
decided to get dressed 30 minutes later
and take the kids right where their mom
and dad were I drove them to the wedding
which was at her friend's house and had
them go in the men there tried to stop
the kids till my sister and her husband
came rushing my sister was shocked she
started shouting at me but I quickly got
in the car and drove off I went home and
she started calling me after she
realized I wasn't going to pick up she
sent a few texts calling me unhinged and
a a [ __ ]
a [ __ ]
you you censored the b word but you
didn't censor the the f word
B asterisk dollar sign
for putting her in the situation and
embarrassing her in front of her friends
she mentioned that by bringing the kids
to the child free wedding I disrespected
her friend which affected their
relationship and caused her and her
husband to go home and miss out on the
rest of the wedding her husband calls
later and I pick up thinking he'd speak
to me rationally like he always does but
he scolded me saying it wouldn't hurt if
I kept the kids for a few hours then
expressed how disappointed he was and
how salvish and Petty I was to do this
okay it's too easy obviously your sister
uh is in the wrong in this situation
we got to start sorting by controversial
everybody sucks here no I disagree
I side with the 25 year old uh med
student who had three her three nieces
and nephews dropped off on her doorstep
without her sister ever asking in the
first place
I side with the student on this one
let me find some [ __ ] ones how about
this one I love the neighbor conflicts
because they're so petty but they seem
so serious when you're in them am I the
[ __ ]
is there a way to hide this thing that
says similar to this post
get get out of here Naruto AFV from 2007
thank you for the gifted subscription
subscriptions by the way thank you you
have to use old Reddit for that
fair enough okay this is a great
username
like I don't want to see the news on on
Reddit man
I've been living in uh am I the [ __ ]
for wanting my neighbor to remove her
ring doorbell I've been living in my
apartment complex for two years and it's
been wonderful recently a young woman
moved in across from my apartment we
introduced briefly and apart from the
noise made when she was having movers
bring in her things she's very quiet and
polite hey why mention that it was loud
when the movers uh moved her in of
course it was loud when the movers moved
you in too dummy
that's what happens this is one day
maybe like at most it takes like a week
and then it's over with that does not
strengthen your point it makes it makes
it seem like you're holding a grudge
over something you yourself admit is
understandable however there's one thing
that bothers me she has a ring doorbell
on her door recently I saw her leaving
and I asked why she had it and then I
was worried she could see me in my
apartment
sanest individual of all time
she she said she out of her packages and
due to no peepholes on the door and just
extra security she showed me that yes
she can see my door a bit but assured me
she's not on her phone all day checking
it I expect expressed my
uncomfortableness and asked her to
remove it she told me she's sorry I was
uncomfortable but she's not spying on me
and she had a right to have one up she
wasn't breaking her lease and she's seen
other people in the complex have one I
told her I don't care about other people
I want a gun or I'll be reporting her
for what
she told me not to bother and call their
property manager regarding it because I
got a visit from her later asking me to
leave her in the doorbell alone am I
really out of line for this yes you're
insane
you've lost your mind
I don't know what to do
I don't know what else to say
um
there's I I can't mine anything off of
this are you yeah are you on the FBI's
uh
most wanted criminals list um this is
not like if you don't have anything to
hide you wouldn't need privacy okay it's
just it's a doorbell camera
I guarantee you're not doing anything
and you okay you know because a person
that was doing something
they would just rip it off and then say
oh sorry I saw the movers bump into it
with a box or something like that
they would they would if they were
already in for a penny it's in for a
pound with some crimes right maybe not
every crime but I just don't understand
you know it's and I talk about this now
and then when you live in an apartment
it's a it's a knife that cuts both ways
you have to
be saner
then you have to be if you live in a
single family home okay you don't uh you
can't play music as loud as you want at
all times of the day you can't make as
much of a mess in like the shared areas
and stuff like that but at the same time
you also have to be understandable when
you're slightly inconvenienced in a
reasonable fashion by other people so I
get so annoyed whenever there's like a
HOA meeting or something like that and
people are like should we ban dogs from
the apartment complex because sometimes
they piss on the ground and I'm like I'm
sorry to tell you
well you're living with people the
people who have a right to have pets
sometimes you're going to see some dog
[ __ ] okay sometimes you're gonna see
some dog pee so and sometimes people are
gonna take their bike through a hallway
and you're gonna see like a little trail
of dirt on the hallway the the solution
to this is not banned bikes from the
building the solution to this is like
you get get a life you get a life and
you get something like more important to
care about than the exact height of
someone's grass on their lawn or
something like that right similar
situation first off it seems like this
lady is like in the wrong to begin with
because of the fact that the property
manager told her to f off but even if it
was against the the tenants of the
apartment building itself who cares man
it's just it's a doorbell
the I my verdict here is get a life
that's the and honestly my sentence is
imposed immediately this is gal get a
life
ring doorbells violate privacy laws
according to data protection statutes
okay but listen she didn't say that
she did not say it's an Amazon camera
that sells his data to the police she
said I'm worried that she can see inside
of my apartment door with her ring
camera that's crazy she's still she's
still on get a life for sure
once again get a life you know what
maybe that's to get a life hold on
okay we're going back one I'm not
standing the ring Corporation
but if you gave me the opportunity to if
I have to choose one either the the
extra judicial ring Corporation or that
lady I'm going to dinner with the extra
judicial Corporation I'm sorry to say
maybe that makes me a bad person
but I'm choosing who I have to spend
time with you can catch me reading a
magazine in the waiting room I'm not
going to her house
you should pray it seems like the kind
of person you wear like nice clothes
like just clean casual clothes you go
into her house she says something
sarcastic like you didn't have to dress
up
am I the [ __ ] for not wanting my
husband to walk his sister down the
aisle
probably I mean I I deliberately picked
it because it says [ __ ] I'm not gonna
lie
my husband Mike is the eldest in his
family he's pretty close with his sister
Beth and they spend almost all week
together Beth had issues with her father
growing up she went no contact with him
after he took her first car and damaged
it she only remained in contact with
Mike since everybody else judged her for
going no contact
she's getting married to her fiance of
three years from what I understand she
and her dad are slowly getting
reconciled but she made it clear she
wants him to take no part in the wedding
she asked Mike if he could walk her down
the aisle and he agreed and I took that
personally wait where's the problem I
have to say I was taken aback and I've
it felt a bit odd for me someone who's
not involved at all because her dad is
alive in their on-speaking terms again
he's going to be there at the wedding so
the logical thing to do is have him walk
her down the aisle the role isn't for
her older brother but her father not to
mention how the father-in-law will feel
about it I brought this up with Beth and
she had an attitude and implied I was
just saying this because of how I feel
about the situation not our traditions
and how they should be practiced we got
into an argument and she went home
I went home Mike thinks I'm being
unreasonable and possibly causing him to
miss something so sentimental and that
if anything he feels honored
to be asked to do this for and said I
should stop worrying about what others
might say now we're having this conflict
three of us and cannot seem to reach a
solution here's the solution
you why why are you part it's this
sentence right here now we're having
this conflict three of us
the wife
like the bride
the person she asked to do something for
her and then you someone with whom it
has you don't your opinion on this is
weightless it means nothing but you
shouldn't be involved
now we're having this conflict and
cannot seem to reach a solution you need
this is I'm sentencing you to get a life
as well
I'm sorry
but this is not there's some situations
where I'm like this is the right thing
to be concerned about but you're still
the [ __ ] this is like even worse than
the ring doorbell situation you've
manufactured a problem out of thin air
let your husband walk his sister down
the aisle sit politely through the
ceremony take advantage of the open bar
at the reception
go home
wake up at 9 30 a.m on Sunday morning
get some chores done live your life like
what's the issue I don't I don't
understand why you're
why are you making it so complicated
it's not even your wedding
there the the you're absolutely right
there was no problem the problem was
solved by the two people involved
and then you said no there's a problem
here there's no reason for this
it I don't even know what else to read
into this like there's no uh
I I've got to find like the first not
the [ __ ] because I need to see what
the other side thinks here there was no
conflict except for your unwanted
opinion

supportive role in her wedding make you

man I don't sort by controversial that's
how you end up
here's my impression of somebody in the
controversial most controversial Post in
every am I the [ __ ] thread not
related to Public Health something
something something the vaccines uh
can you add like a sane filter to to
controversial as well
that would be nice
I'm scrolling
am I the [ __ ] for making my son walk
the wall hold on hold on am I the
[ __ ] for using a spray bottle to
train my nephew
hold on hold on
before I get started here this is a
genuine question the first sentence my
nephew is a rainbow baby I need I need
to inform myself
at first I thought a rainbow baby was
one of those kids that the parents are
convinced they have psychic powers
but I think that means that's an indigo
child it's two different things
okay it's a baby born after a
complication from a previous pregnancy
okay
mm-hmm
well I'm glad I looked it up
but they could also have psychic powers
I don't know how it's relevant to using
a spray bottle to train them but anyway
let's see
my nephew is a rainbow baby my sister
had trouble conceiving he was kind of a
miracle she was 42 when she finally
managed to give birth she was on bed
rest for the last three months of her
pregnancy my nephew's now six and while
I love him he's a monster he throws
tantrums when things don't go his way he
screams if he loses playing a game he
refuses to understand why he can't ride
my seven-year-old Saint Bernard you have
okay
both this two things can be true at the
same time
a six-year-old can be a little crazy and
you can be frustrated by it and it can
also still be normal behavior
for sure
just because it's just because it's a
kid doesn't mean you don't get
frustrated by it but it does mean like
it it doesn't make your case as strong
as it would be if it was an adult
and he thinks any food is his my husband
is diabetic and he loves cookies I found
a bakery that makes amazing sugar-free
cookies but they are expensive I budget
for them because my husband deserves his
treats when he gets home from work I'm
sorry to tell you that your husband does
not matter anymore
give the kid the cookies I like he'll
understand
if he comes home and you're like sorry I
fed the six-year-old the the sugar-free
cookies just to calm him down he would
be like a little disappointed but he'd
be like you know what I get it
what else is new I think
unless her husband is a dog in which
case he might be inconsolable let's see
my sister was visiting and my nephew was
running around like a squirrel he
tripped and also can you just like hide
them or something I don't understand
is the kid like seven feet tall why
don't you just put him in like a
overhead cabin or something man I don't
know I don't get it my sister was
visiting my nephew was running around
like a little squirrel he tripped and
started crying so my sister picked him
up he saw the cookie container on the
counter and started asking for some I
said no they're special cookies for his
uncle I offered him a regular cookie or
some fruit but he got got all upset that
he was being denied my sister asked if
he could please have a cookie okay bad
parenting in my opinion bad parenting
it's a it's a little micro example but
if you're in somebody else's house and
they say they can't have my property and
then the parents should respect that and
not be like no please give it to them
my sister asked if you could please have
a cookie I relented and gave him one he
took a bite and said it was yucky and
threw it on the ground I was a little
upset a little while later he came and
asked for another cookie I said no my
sister said to just give him one I told
her no he wasted the last one he started
screaming that he wanted a cookie I
stood my ground my ground he eventually
went away you're a better parent than
the actual Mom I'm sorry to tell you at
least in this micro example you look
like a better example you look like a
better parent than the actual mom here
next time he came he didn't ask he just
went for the container I grabbed the
spray bottle I used to keep the cat off
the counter I gave him a couple of
Squirts and said no he got startled and
ran away my sister said her son isn't an
animal to be reprimanded with water the
next time he came into my kitchen I put
my hand on the spray bottle he didn't
even look at the counter and went away
my sister called my parents to tell on
me wait aren't you like in your 40s
to tell on me for treating her kid like
that they are mad at me for not giving
in to her poor baby okay
I'm just gonna be honest
it's like
not the [ __ ] and also hilarious
for a multitude of different reasons
okay and this is just my model for it
okay
but if you are if you and your kid are
in somebody else's house
the person whose house it is gets to be
the good cop
and you as the parent has to be the bad
cop
you can't be a parent and child United
against the host to get what you want
you have to be
like you have to say no my kid can't
have a cookie
and then if the host is like well he can
have one cookie then you're like okay
but make sure to say thank you you know
Aunt Vivian who
a good this is the first ant name that
popped into my head
because I grew up watching The Fresh
Prince of Bel Air at least a little bit
but
and that's the way the cycle goes around
now you got cool and you've established
boundaries as a parent the kid
understands that you know they don't
just get a choice they don't get
complete control of what they're doing
in all situations and then it goes
around and around and around if the
parent is unwilling to do that and you
force the ants to be the mom well then
she gets to choose the discipline within
reason
you know it's it using a spray bottle on
the kid I think the kid at six listen
people will say like they're just a kid
and that's true but six is old enough to
understand that actions have
consequences
you know not I wouldn't expect a
six-year-old to be like oh I don't want
to eat candy because long term it might
contribute to like insulin sensitivity I
don't expect them to have that kind of
long-term planning but like someone told
me not to eat a cookie I'm gonna go eat
it then sure
give them a little spray with the spray
bottle why not and plus apparently it
worked
honestly I'm the only thing I want to
criticize the the ant for in this
situation is that I feel like most
six-year-olds would just power through
like they got they got sprayed in the
face with a little bit of water they'd
be like okay my face gets wet and I get
unlimited cookies like that's a that's a
sweet trade but it worked so I'm not
gonna be a hater I'm just I'm surprised
that the punishment was that effective
but I I don't think she's the [ __ ] I
think the mom needs to
you know I'm not sure what word I want
to use
she needs to be a little firmer in
establishing boundaries for her child
also what kind of you got offered like a
real cookie and you want to eat the
sugar-free one like just relax
you know red is going to call her an
[ __ ]
I don't know it's tough because the
stereotype on Reddit is that they hate
women
but they also hate kids and I think they
might hate kids more than they hate
women
and they I think they and again this
sounds like out of context it sounds bad
I think on Reddit people like
women when they're being like good
parents and family members they hate
women when they stop uh their partner
from doing something that he wants to do
am I the [ __ ] for punching a hole in
my wall after my girlfriend said she
doesn't want me to ride a motorcycle
without my helmet on that's always like
it's uh it's your house where does she
think she can get off using you for your
refrigerator and your sweet Dolby setup
and then tell you how to live your life
you better kick her to the curb and make
sure you film the whole thing so she
doesn't try to accuse you of something
you know
I think if it was like am I the [ __ ]
for
um telling my nephew he's a little
fricker
they would be like no kids suck you're
based let's see
I mean not the [ __ ] obviously does
the spray bottle work on your sister
I cackled I can't read this man I'm
sorry I legitimate I can't read your
comment if it starts with I literally
cackled
ah let's do it I legitimately cackled
because my ADHD brain would immediately
go listen I don't know what else to do
but there's a squirt bottle in my
current perception and it works on pets
that's fair I totally get it so let's
break this down before some weirdo comes
in and tries to make you feel guilty no
I want the weirdo to come in I want to
read the weirdo
your husband has specific needs that can
get pricey as a person who has dietary
limitations and who lives with others
who do as well I know how unfair the
Celiac and diabetic tax is on a budget
strained house this kid's going to get
hit so hard by the world I'm going to
kick that son of a [ __ ] bison's ass so
hard
that the next bison wannabe is going to
feel it
I'm gonna kick that son of a [ __ ]
bison's ass so hard
I am
the next bison Hornady is going to feel
it
this kid is going to get hit so hard by
the world and I legitimately bet this is
the first time anyone said this so I
have two things for you a golden not the
[ __ ] that I will vigorously and
aggressively defend and advice if your
sister can't get her kid to understand
your house has rules for a reason and
that you're unable to afford financially
or from a stress perspective her
excessive spoiling of that kid simply
ban them from coming over you have every
right to protect your home your sanity
and quite frankly I hope it right pisses
her off if you do it so she's forced to
realize the way she's raising or not
raising her child harms others actually
a very sensible comment until it always
takes a Reddit swerve at the end which
is we have a minor disagreement in a
situation that in a week we'll all laugh
about cut them off never see him again
issue a psychotic ultimatum as soon as
possible
I regret that I have only the one updoot
to give same
not the [ __ ] yeah not the [ __ ]
okay I mean this is fair we're starting
to get into it a little bit here
I'm gonna kick that son of a [ __ ]
bison's ass so hard
am I the [ __ ] for making my son walk
the dog [ __ ] this should be good
throw away account and fake names
because my wife is also on Reddit
brother if you don't want your wife to
find your Mi the [ __ ] post you should
make up a fake story
what kind of person is going to read a
story that Echoes their real life one
for one and then be like well the names
are changed though this can't be
this exact thing happened to me and uh
all of our children are exactly the same
age and yet
the names are different
you know what I think you're right the
the best comments are not the ones that
are like you're the [ __ ] there's
never an excuse to spray a six-year-old
with a spray bottle the best comments
are the ones that are like not the
[ __ ] and also you didn't go far
enough
your sister should be in prison for
child neglect
my uncle would never have let me get
away with that when I was six
except he couldn't because he uh died
saving me from the train tracks as a and
uh so on and such as and uh and the and
the in the gym and the face and the in
the banks yeah the pigs
sorry
sorry
moving on
throwaway count of fake names because my
wife is also on Reddit and sorry for the
long post don't be sorry just trim it
down like 40 my wife and I have three
sons Alex Dylan and Jake when I was a
kid I always wanted a dog but my parents
said no I never got the chance to get
one during my 20s but recently my
interest in owning one was sparked again
so I asked my family what they thought
about getting a dog my wife wasn't
enthusiastic about it but she relented
after a few weeks of me asking
Alex and Jake were excited to get one
but Dylan's immediately opposed to this
idea you're you're 42 years old why are
you writing like this
I'm not saying you should just go out
and buy a dog if you want a dog because
you're 42. I'm just saying like why are
you writing like
when I was a kid I always wanted a dog
okay like
but you're not a kid anymore you're 42.
it's not to say that you can't have a
dog at age 42 but like why are you using
your childhood ambition
as like a as a cudgel here I don't
understand
hey Setra 13. thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
I'm not shaming him for having childhood
dreams
okay it's just that
I mean does it have bigger problems
like
listen I don't know where this is going
so maybe I shouldn't jump in and judge
it
but like if you want a dog
you could just get okay let's read it
you're right let's not go in too far
it's just the first sentence sorry I
primed myself with re look he's the
[ __ ] based on the flare let me go in
okay
Dylan was always different than my other
Sons he never had an interest in sports
and was always more subdued than his
brothers which always made it hard for
me to connect with him right yep he's
not into football
like it's hard it's hard for two men to
connect over something that's not like a
round ball trying to go through a net he
remained opposed to the idea of getting
a dog but me and my other Sons managed
to wear him down until he finally
relented hey hey hey Dylan's 11 years
old why don't you just get a dog
and then take care of it and if he's
he's 11.
who cares
you don't need the whole house to
like be on exactly the same page on
every decision it's crazy
is he if he are you afraid of dogs sure
if he's got a dog phobia otherwise why
don't you just buy a dog and Dylan might
be like I'm not gonna walk it okay then
I'll walk it it was my childhood dream
to have a dog
I think Dylan just wants his dad to
start with like a gerbil first and then
be like hey Dad I know you've always
wanted a dog but let's try a gerbil for
like three months and if you take care
of the gerbil and you still love it then
we can talk about the dog
okay
problem is he hasn't changed his mind
yet
wait however however he said if we did
get a dog he wasn't going to be
interacting with it or taking care of it
that it would be completely on me and on
his brothers I found this ridiculous as
it seems very sensible that seems like
something an 11 year old would say and
also is completely fine because it's the
dad who wants the dog I don't understand
what's going on here
of course he's not going to stick with
it no no 11 year old kid is going to be
like I'm going to ignore this dog for
his whole life he's probably gonna pet
him like on day two and be like and that
was my best friend but like the dad's
got the responsibility to take care of
the dog
he the problem is he hasn't changed his
mind we've had Zeus for seven months now
and Dylan has not warmed up to us to him
in the scientist he doesn't play with
the dog he doesn't cuddle with him
he doesn't let Zeus into his room
because he destroys stuff whenever he is
near the dog he just ignores him I find
this completely ridiculous Zeus loves
Dylan and he follows him around whenever
he sees him and jumps up on him to get
his attention but Dylan just isn't
receptive to it to change this I told
Dylan last week he would be in charge of
walking the dog every day after school
wake up honey dumbest idiot on the earth
just dropped
psychotic [ __ ]
just uh
popped up from the ground like a little
prairie dog
Dylan straight up refused and he shut
down the conversation every time I bring
it up it's been a week and he hasn't
walked the dog once in my frustration I
told him if he didn't start listening I
wouldn't allow him to go to the comic
book store anymore he freaked out and
told my wife
Dylan you freaking narc
how dare you
my son's a damn snitch man he told Mom
now my wife is upset with me claiming I
knew what I was getting into with this
and I knew Dylan wouldn't be playing
with the dog but his intolerance of the
dog was weird and I can't entertain her
any longer my wife has been short with
me ever since that conversation and
Dylan is cold with me as well Alex is
now agreeing with his mother which is
making me have second thoughts Rizzo
ready am I the [ __ ] this one is going
to have some insane
comments like insane that are like
you're the [ __ ] but you should leave
your family and let them get like a
benevolent stepdad there's 100 gonna be
comments that are like
you should let your fan if you can't
respect your family's happiness you
should just leave them let's see so
obviously he's an [ __ ] like there's
nothing is is cut and dry
it's not even up like there's not no
gray area whatsoever
I don't need there's nothing to mine
except let's see what some see the
madness that goes on in the peanut
gallery
oh my God the bullet points man
so you are three people who want a dog
and could take care of a dog but your
son who didn't want the dog has to even
though you told him he wouldn't have to
what you've taught your son you are a
liar it's okay to not take care of your
own responsibilities and you punish him
intentionally because he isn't you edit
thank you for the awards I appreciate it
but please stop this comment is
ingenious or anything great stop stop
with uh and heroes not a word we use
lightly you know what it's the
firefighters that are the real he stop
I mean it's a sane comment
Dylan I won't interact with the dog op
buys the dog Dylan doesn't interact with
the dog op
by the way you're the [ __ ]
that's it's a meme I like it okay let me
get this straight your son doesn't like
sports so it's hard for you to connect
with him he didn't want a dog but you
got one anyway and when he didn't change
his mind you punished him the one hobby
you say he does like Comics you want to
ban him from until he shows interest in
your hobby okay you know what when you
put it that way I'm starting to think
this guy might be a little bit of an
[ __ ] I just you're the [ __ ] Big
Time poor Dylan seven years and counting
wanna bet
what is them oh until he can move out
okay
Alex The Heir the pride and joy with the
same lengths as you Dylan despair can't
click with you because you do not
understand him Jake the baby again
someone you can click with holy cow man
Dylan situated Dylan's situation sounds
like the typical overlooked middle child
here's my impression of middle children
this is classic middle child stuff
this reminds me so much of being a
middle child
sorry
middle children mouthing I'm a middle
child I'm also the oldest and the
youngest
riddle me this
he is his own person is has not to be
your carbon copy to show the world your
manliness your prowess betwixt the
sheets you wore your wife down with
weeks of nagging then you set your
sights on your defenseless child he said
no you pressured him you used your
Authority person your position as an
authority person to wear him down saying
yes to a dog he warned you your dog not
his problem and what are you doing now
again stomping over him
trampling his boundaries into the dust
just because again he isn't a carbon
copy of you is his own person with his
own wants and his own needs in future
years when you browse through social
media and see a post that he is engaged
but he didn't tell you when you see
wedding photos for a wedding you got no
invitation to the birth the baptism of a
grandchildren you will never see then
search for this post read it and maybe
then you will understand that no is a
full sentence
but until then the Lord of The Manor
wants a dog Lord of The Manor gets a dog
after nagging cajoling pressuring wife
and middle child into agreeing but now
the Lord is pissed that a forced yes is
still a no and again abuses his
authority as a parent to pressure said
child in the behavior the Lord deems
acceptable
there are people out there who let
dislike dirt
there are people out there who dislike
dogs who want a gerbil a cat a snake
there are people out there who are so
against getting a pet since they know
exactly who will have to care for them
not the owner no
the care will be placed onto their
shoulders if they want it or not as you
are doing now but guess what
there are people out there who know how
to help themselves to stand up for
themselves
how often do you think you can force
Dylan to try to bond with Zeus by
walking him to play with him to care for
him how fast comes the day when you come
home from work and get informed that
Dylan walked Zeus as the Lord ordered
but sadly Zeus got away and is nowhere
to be found and all this just because
you can't accept that Dylan is not you
Dylan's gonna kill the dog
edit thank you for the redditors for the
kind Awards I finally figured out how to
get a notice for them and say thank you
via the chat I hope in case this doesn't
work again thank you and please say a
prayer for Dylan will ya
holy
saying his comment on the internet just
dropped why is it is written like uh
this comment was brought to you by Peter
Baelish
Lord of The Manor wanted a dog but that
didn't matter Peter did not want one but
that didn't matter did it Ned did it
what the Lord wants the Lord gets and
who had to look after the dog who had to
feed it and water the dog and find an
off-leash park because in a normal Park
you can't take your dog off the leash or
someone might yell at you because
there's kids running around
not to mention it wasn't until the
eldest child started imagine reading
this insane comment and then being like
you know what
not to mention it wasn't until the
eldest child started siding with the
mother and brother that op started
second guessing himself the words of his
wife and son were not enough this is the
vibe at like packs when somebody in in
like uh Shepherd cosplay goes up and
gets a hot dog uh it's my favorite hot
dog on the Citadel
yeah that'll be um 697 there
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank you thank you
did you want a side salad with that or
or are you good with the fries
when someone Googles total [ __ ]
I'm guessing your photo pops up first
you're a manipulative husband and a
crappy father who doesn't like it when
he can't get his own way
well
I'm
it's a little much
bless I've Googled it and that is not
what comes up by the way
okay so sane sane sane
sane it's all it's a lot of sanity
one that's written like uh
you know like an essay where every line
is its own paragraph nope nope okay
all right fair enough
nothing's ever going to compare to the
second best comment for sure
am I the [ __ ] for refusing to pay to
fix the babysitter's laptop
let me guess oh wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait am I the [ __ ] for
begging my boyfriend not to bring Heinz
Ketchup to Omakase
I I'm sorry I gotta know
okay one sec
mm-hmm
sorry this all seems ridiculous but I
need to sanity check I consider myself a
foodie but my boyfriend Jay is the exact
opposite like he'll literally eat but
it's more than that he always starts
things with me when I try to take him
out for good food for example last year
I got us reservations at a steakhouse
and he made a point of ordering his
steak well done with ketchup the thing
is he doesn't even like eating his food
he does it this way to make a point that
no one not even I can tell him how to
make his food or eat his food well his
birthday is coming up and he likes sushi
so I wanted to treat him to a nice
Omakase experience it's where you sit
with the chef and eat the food in front
of them it's more than I spend on food
in two weeks but I thought it could be
fun for both of us today he told me he's
only going to go if he can bring a
bottle of Heinz ketchup and put it on
the table I thought he was joking but he
was did like uh did did Heston
Blumenthal steal your girlfriend in high
school or something like what happened
why does he have such a chip on his
shoulder about fine dining I don't
understand
did Nancy Silverton like hit you with
her car what's the
what's the issue
please read the comments okay well just
I haven't even finished the post yet
okay
I told him I've literally never seen him
or anyone else enjoy sushi with ketchup
he actually got mad at me saying no one
gets to decide for him how he eats his
food he went on to yell at me that it's
a shitty birthday gift because I'm the
foodie and he isn't I think he's being
obnoxious with the ketchup thing but
maybe he's just making a point about me
forcing my hobbies on him I don't know
am I the [ __ ] no not in the slightest
you know what though why don't you give
him what he's always wanted why don't
you give him why don't you take a trip
to the Heinz Ketchup Museum
in Allentown Pennsylvania
for his birthday that's if he loves
ketchup so much then why hey if you love
ketchup so much then why don't you go
why don't you go to the Heinz Museum and
[ __ ] your ketchup bottle
why don't you why don't you [ __ ] your
bong
you know what
I will [ __ ] my bong doggy style for once
it's from Knocked Up
anyway
info
okay hold on
info your boyfriend opposes fine dining
why is that your birthday gift to him
exactly if I was an avid camper and my
significant other hated it
and always insisted on bringing
ridiculous stuff and making a scene to
prove a point I would not be planning a
camping trip for her maybe they need to
have a deeper conversation about putting
up with activities the other person
doesn't enjoy for the sake of their
relationship or maybe they're just not
compatible Counterpoint why is your
boyfriend so [ __ ] weird
also yeah she said her boyfriend likes
sushi
so she's taking him to a nice sushi
restaurant what does he like sushi but
only if it [ __ ] sucks or it's like
out of a styrofoam container I don't
understand
also count info why is your boyfriend so
weird
I don't get it
why would you take him to Omakase for
his birthday if he isn't a foodie sounds
like a gift for you op does say he likes
Sushi though okay here we go person who
has had sushi two times in their life I
feel like there's a big range of what
people might mean when they say they
like sushi like if someone likes
California rolls and all those
Americanized rolls with avocados and
jalapenos they could say they like sushi
is a traditional Japanese sushi no but
it's still a type of sushi or maybe they
like sushi boats where you pick little
dishes off of a conveyor belt Omakase is
a pretty specific type of sushi served
in a specific way according to Wikipedia
speaking of someone who does like a good
Omakase I can see how someone who claims
to like sushi might not necessarily like
Omakase
hey thanks for the birthday gift
girlfriend but this isn't exactly the
kind of sushi that I like and I'm an
adult man which means apparently I don't
know how to have a conversation instead
I have to just escalate the bit like
it's some kind of improv sketch
it actually is pretty
Reef for an adult man to throw a temper
tantrum because he said he likes Sushi
and you take him to nice Sushi instead
of cheap sushi what's wrong with you
you're the [ __ ]
why are you taking them out to nice
restaurants for his birthday do
something else either he finds you
controlling or he's messing with you in
a way you don't find funny either way
there's no good reason to try to force
the experience you want for his birthday
oh and if he did bring ketchup in to
make a point he'd be an [ __ ] as well
and possibly not allowed by staff yeah
you can tell him at it you can't tell
him how to eat but is still rude
here's the thing he's the [ __ ] but
you're the [ __ ]
taking he I find it hard to believe Opie
wouldn't know this would be how the plan
would go so why even bother take him to
McDonald's he'd probably be happier you
got to break up with your boyfriend if
he says like take me to McDonald's for
my birthday
he's a grown man I I eat McDonald's two
times this week but you gotta like
there's a time and a place man
come on
boyfriend needs to get a life bro your
girlfriend's taking you out for nice
Sushi why don't you just eat the sushi I
don't understand just
like so many of these posts I'm like why
you're gonna run into enough bumps in
your life without getting in your own
way you know
it's your birthday your girlfriend says
I want to take you out for a nice meal
okay
go out for a nice meal and eat it like I
don't understand
or have a conversation and be like hey I
appreciate that you were thinking of me
and I do like sushi but only the gas
station kind at the same time could you
instead take that money and buy me
um
a yearly subscription to Maxim magazine
or something like that I just don't
understand like why you or yeah like
seven pairs of shoes from winners or TJ
Maxx like I don't understand the problem
like
well you got to be you catch up with a
month club sure even better
I also think it the fact that he doesn't
like eating out I don't buy it everybody
likes eating their restaurants it's like
a universal truth
who doesn't like eating good food
not me what if someone else is paying
I don't
yeah but this guy's in a relationship
you've got that's like one of the a lot
of being in a relationship is just like
two people going to a restaurant with
each other you know
if he doesn't like going to restaurants
maybe you should just stay single for
the rest of his life that's like at
least 30 percent of the damn deal
I just I just don't understand why he's
getting in his own his own damn way man
just doesn't make sense
the nuclear take
them to an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet
listen okay it's it's a little snobby
it's a little judgmental
you two adults
she has the means apparently to at least
with some budgeting afford the nice
Sushi meal
can't take him to it all on all you can
eat sushi buffet is where you take like
a 12 year old or a 55 year old for their
birthday it's not where two people in
like a romantic relationship with each
other go in their mid-20s
that's when you go to a nice place
before you got to get in the the night
by the way yo hey Aaron thank you thank
you appreciate the gifted subscriptions
that's when you go to the nice places
and then it later if you choose if you
choose you have a kid and you're like
man I'm really glad I went to all those
nice places because now I absolutely I
can only go to restaurants that have a
lot of parking a lot of seating high
chairs available french fries and
quesadillas on the menu for like the
next 12 years that's my life right
just enjoy the experience it's not going
to last forever
yes you start eating
you're all your family dinners are the
damn Old Spaghetti Factory man
everybody sucks here
you don't bring your own condiments but
I'm guessing you're a pain in the ass
about food to which he reacts by
ordering food that will annoy you both
are absurd behaviors also you don't
bring someone to restaurants you want to
go to for their birthday you go to their
favorite yeah but he's 10. I don't know
I'm sorry listen I think in principle
yes
but in practice
grow up
you can't just go to a great restaurant
for your birthday it has to be your
favorite restaurant like how old are you
it's like how the six-year-old who got
hit with a spray bottle react I know
it's your special day I just get one day
I just get one special day can I okay
well then offer this suggestion don't
just threaten the the ketchup uh the
football you know you got to turn two
keys at the same time in a Heinz Bottle
Pops out and ruins your relationship
like just relax why don't you just be
like I don't want to go to the sushi
restaurant doesn't make any damn sense
she'll be like fine where do you want to
go and he'll suggest a place that has 5
out of 10 food but like 92 beers on tap
she'll be like okay fine for one night
for one night I'll get um rigatoni
Bolognese at a pub for you because it's
your favorite restaurant because you're
a little kid
that's the spirit of a relationship okay
he needs to learn how to compromise yes
even on his birthday
or I don't know maybe he could take the
sauce
am I in the [ __ ] for refusing to I
got a lot of minus twos on that it's
like the most minus twos I've ever
gotten and I'm living for it
I I wear those minus twos proudly
am I the [ __ ] for refusing to pay to
fix the baby but as you know that he'd
be like as soon as he sat down for the
Omakase he'd be like you gotta need
sushi that isn't too fishy don't even
give me I don't want to be on the right
side of history in that one
am I the [ __ ] for refusing to pay to
fix the babysitter's laptop
I single mom of two hired a babysitter
after I started working a new job used
to do work from home for two years
join the club my kids are eight and six
the babysitter's 17. if my two kids each
want an Apple for every two years
they've been alive the babysitter only
has 94 cents for every year that she's
been alive what grocery store should she
buy the apples from in order to ensure
that everybody has a good snack time
she brings her laptop with her to study
which is perfectly okay with me as long
as she keeps an eye on the kids okay
sane person spotted so far yesterday I
came home and the babysitter showed me
your laptop that got broken by my
youngest I was shocked and asked how
this happened she said she left the
laptop in the living room and went to
make the kids lunch but my youngest
grabbed it and ran with it till he
dropped it and broke the screen I said
that was horrible and apologized but
stated it was her fault for leaving the
laptop within reach of children she said
she thought my kids were old enough to
know not to touch other stuff I
explained they might have thought it
belonged to us since it was in our house
she asked if I could pay to get it fixed
but I refused and insisted it was her
problem not mine she ranted about having
exams soon she did some [ __ ] about
that I'm a student I got a test I got
that I gotta take some tests I wasn't
listening or whatever because I was
already seeing red
she ranted and about having not having
enough money to get it fixed we argued I
had to tell her to go home after she
persisted later on I got a call from her
dad basically blaming the whole thing on
me and demanding I pay to get the laptop
fixed but I still refused now she's
refusing to come again unless I pay for
her laptop repair even though I paid her
in advance to watch the kids
everybody sucks here I'm not just taking
the side of the parent
foreign
the parent definitely sucks they have a
responsibility the child broke something
that didn't belong to them at the same
time
like when you're the just just relax for
a second just before you get the minus
two just relax a second what do the
babysitter do the kids are in her care
and you gotta understand that like a
six-year-old you gotta watch him like
I'm not saying she was negligent
but you you if you have like valuable
fragile stuff in the house that's why
you have to keep an eye on them so when
they pick it up you say put that [ __ ]
down you're gonna break it
I feel like they both played a role I
think they got to cut the laptop in half
she's 17 though
yes and
if she was six months older she'd be
like legally culpable I don't buy it
I'm not saying the parent doesn't suck
I'm simply saying that well suck is not
the right answer I think they're being
an [ __ ] in this situation but I do
think everybody I I think both parties
are morally
morally both parties I think are
culpable
I don't know I might I might say 70
parent responsibility 30 babysitter
responsibility
what's my basis for that I [ __ ] made
it up
okay
there's nothing there's nothing I'm sure
in the criminal code that allows you to
hand down a judgment like that but
I I made it the [ __ ] up
you should have sprayed her with a spray
bottle true not the babysitter the kid
just to be clear
I don't know there's nothing else to say
I guess I don't even want to read the
comments on this because you already
know what everybody's going to be saying
it's because red is very anti-child
but like if you have this all I'm saying
this is just me arguing the 30 I'm not
arguing the 70 okay
if you're the babysitter and you're like
you're you're in charge of the kids
during the time that you're watching
them
if she said like oh
one of the kids like threw up on my
keyboard and it broke I would be like
that's a hundred percent my fault as the
parent if they were like I wasn't
watching them and they picked it up and
ran with it and then fell over and
smashed it I'd be like well why didn't
you [ __ ]
say put that [ __ ] down
seems like that's something that you
could have had a role in preventing she
was making them lunch
so [ __ ] to have the kids come into
the kitchen while you're making them
lunch move the laptop to the kitchen
while you're making them lunch put the
laptop in your laptop bag while you're
making them lunch or something like that
like
there's we tried nothing and we're all
out of ideas man
she's 17 though I'm not saying put her
in the freaking chokey I'm just saying
it's partly her responsibility as well
let's say it's send her to prison I'm
just saying yeah she's 17 she made a
mistake that maybe an adult that's older
who has more experience in these
situations wouldn't have made
what if the kid what if she was uh I was
changing one of the kids diapers the
other one grabbed the knife
and put it into the electrical socket
can you pay for my laptop my I you I
didn't have it plugged into a surge
protector and now it's broken
well the parent shouldn't what was the
parent doing having an electrical socket
with the babysitter she was
she was she was changing a diaper
I'm still fighting you know what I'm
just for that 65-35
60 40.
60 40. I'm getting close to now that
being said I can definitely understand
why the babysitter would not come back
to the house it seems like they have a
very acrimonious relationship right now
it and it seems a little bit brain dead
to be like I don't understand why she's
holding a grudge well she she doesn't
have any money to fix her laptop and she
she thinks it's your fault or at least
that you should uh
that you should pay for the laptop
I'll send this to your future babysitter
bro this happened to me I would pay for
her laptop
obviously this is a single mom working a
job she's got two kids I understand but
funds are tight
I'm not going to ruin a relationship
with a reliable babysitter over what
like [ __ ] 300 bucks or something like
that I'm not still unlike most of the
people that make these posts I'm not
that stupid at least
my wife wants to take me out to a nice
restaurant oh I'd rather go to Nando's
no thanks like it's not me I'm like yeah
sure let's get to Omakase that sounds
like fun sure sure I'll have I'll have
one cocktail
I don't I don't get in the I try to get
out of my own way as much as possible
instead of getting into my own way
can't forget the Heinz yo can we occupy
that Omakase
how much is a laptop I don't know I mean
it runs the gamut somewhere between
three hundred and two thousand dollars
I mean when I so I learned the program
on a MacBook because Kate had a Macbook
then I took a C sharp class and I was
like I need a Windows laptop I went to
Best Buy I got a laptop for like 350
Canadian dollars it's a piece of [ __ ]
don't you get like 6 000 viewers well
yes at the time
but I just you know
that broke stay rich
Walter
they cost more than that now she was in
like 2017. everything cost more than
that
old where were you in 2017 if you were
still in middle school that's a cell
phone anyway not the kind of cell phone
that uh you grew up on and went to
school on for two years between 2020 and
2022.
all right that was a low blow sorry I
was I got a little heated there
that was probably an iPad anyway
probably wasn't your cell phone
I was in grad school then I was still
suckling off the teeth of the public
sector
I was busy keeping the churn of the
economy running

hold on I'm scrolling you were just
playing Isaac that's pretty true
Hero's not a word I use lightly hey am I
the [ __ ] for telling my pregnant wife
to stop acting like a child
the the post is written like a comment
and I love it it's written like every
paragraph is one sentence
i-35m and my wife 33 off are currently
expecting our first child in December I
live in chronic plane
that would be weird I live in chronic
pain due to a slew of health issues I
also work a job where I'm on my feet
constantly that [ __ ] sucks
that's that's like two bad things that
make each other worse
but I I can't get a new job right now
due to personal reasons but I plan to as
soon as possible listen throw away to
protect my privacy here's my life story
but some things are too personal even
for Reddit okay I don't want to tell you
why I can't get another job but I plan
to as soon as possible my wife quit her
job right after we found out we were
expecting we'd always plan this
problem is she's gotten really lazy
oh
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no
I understand pregnancy is hard but it's
kind of the point she won't even make
food or clean the house sometimes she's
been whining and complaining constantly
since the moment she took the test she
sounds like a child I hungry eyesore I
hungry eyesore my head hurts I'm sick I
can't [ __ ] Etc I understood these things
are normal during pregnancy so as much
as it annoyed me I bit my tongue you
hold up brother she's saying I hungry
eyesore
can I add info
I I have many questions I want to ask
I just want to put info on everything
the second I'd get home every night
she'd want me to do something for her
she expected me to cook and clean as
soon as I got home every night the straw
that broke the camel's back happened a
couple days ago I just gotten home from
a 10 hour shift and I was having a
flare-up I just wanted to have a bath
and relax because I was in so much pain
I told her I had a terrible day and to
just doordash something I rarely let her
do this because those fees are freaking
ridiculous so true so true so I thought
it would be a treat but she said she can
only eat home-cooked meals and that
everything else just makes her sick
this is where I might be the [ __ ] I
yelled at her and told her I had the
worst day she needs to stop complaining
and be an adult for once so she started
crying I immediately apologized over and
over but she left anyway a couple of
hours later my mother-in-law called me
and called me a misogynist they go what
and a slew of other names I hung up
because I don't need that now the beans
are spilled and all the women in my
family are mad at me my wife still won't
speak to me so am I the [ __ ]
um
well like here's the thing
okay careful Ned
I don't
subscribe 100 to the idea
that
a pregnant woman is above criticism
she can be pregnant
I saw I hungry
hormonal and still be an [ __ ] to you
whether it's understandable given the
circumstances or even Beyond you know it
could be not understandable because she
could just be like having it out for you
that being said
the start of the post where you said
she's gotten really late I mean here can
I ask you a question your wife as soon
as she got a a positive pregnancy test
she quit her job that was your plan the
whole time
what the hell do you want her to do of
course she's going to be lazy she's got
like
a she's pregnant so like you basically
said her job is
growing the baby
and like B
I mean I I maybe there is no B
you basically told her like just rest
you need nine months or you know eight
months from the positive test
to to focus on yourself and then it's
like you know she's bringing you
complaints the way that it seems like
you asked for and then you're going what
the hell I'm sore
which is true
I understand it's like
I don't know I I I'm I'm being honest
with you for me this isn't everybody
sucks here
the Lord of The Manor needs a clean
house the Lord of The Manor says the
doordash fees are too freaking High
like a definite when you're pregnant
look I've only I didn't I was not
pregnant I've only even observed one
pregnancy
unless you count me being born I suppose
which I I observed but thankfully has
been white for my memory
there's some parts of it that suck
really bad first trimester Kate had
horrible motion sickness or not motion
sickness morning sickness and also for
like three months was like
please don't eat anything the smell of
what you're eating makes me want to
throw up and also don't come near me
because the smell of you makes me want
to throw up and I was like okay honey uh
I love you I'll be down here in my
office I guess
uh and then the second trimester was
like the Garden of Eden everything was
fine you start doing stuff to prepare
for like the baby you're like building a
family unit and then the third trimester
is just a lot of like
Alicia's baby would get out of me I wish
this baby would get out of me
like
combined with like the
Ridley Scott H.R Geiger type stuff where
she'd be like check this out and she
like show me your stomach and there's
like a foot going like
laughs
so I can understand like why
why she's hungry and sore
oh
does it hurt a lot I don't know I was
mostly just
putting on like 25 pounds of sympathy
weight out of pure laziness for the most
I'm playing a lot of Fall Guys
well there's
like that you know you're just sort of
chilling waiting for the waiting for the
baby to show up
anyway well yeah I mean there don't even
know what else is they're both like bad
here they're both bad I mean I'm not
saying he needs he's bad because he
doesn't wait on his wife's every need
like he's his own person as well he's
got to like work hard harder than usual
right now but there's still a limit like
if he's had a hard day I just
I mean honestly it's very reasonable you
come back from a 10 hour work day and
she's like cook some food for me and
he's like can we just door National
night and she's like no I have to eat
home-cooked food well then [ __ ] cook
a food lady sorry but like
every human being has their limits they
just let it give them can you wait like
you have a snack and wait like a couple
hours you'll have a bath and decompress
a little bit and then he can make some
food
he's still a human being as well
but he should not call his pregnant wife
lazy
even if it is true
that's too far you can't win that
argument like
it's like calling a little kid like an
[ __ ]
like you can think it and in private you
could be like am I good like that kid
who pushed my daughter at the park and
she fell down in my head I'm like that
kid's a [ __ ] [ __ ] but he's three
you can't get you can't you can't be the
guy in the park we'll be gonna be like
this [ __ ] pushed my kid you know you
know you've already lost the argument as
soon as it starts
and in my head I'm also like it's
probably just that his mother is the
[ __ ] and the kid is just like an
extension right now anyway sorry
but let's see this one there's some
I mean there's some conversations to be
had here there's some controversy
everybody sucks here I lived with
chronic pain and I've been pregnant so
my opinion is above criticism it sounds
like neither one of you want to be
supportive it's more of a competition of
who has it worse
I don't totally agree with this comment
but I do think it's fairly reasonable
I don't think that in the at least in
this post I don't think he's saying
I have it harder than her I think he
just wanted to take a damn bath
wait but then why hold on what did he
say to her again
oh yeah you told her to stop being a
child uh be an adult for once okay well
I could yeah I mean he's look you're an
[ __ ] for snapping
but it happens to everybody
he lashed out he was in an emotional
stressed out moment he lashed out I'm
not excusing it I'm simply saying you
know
he's in chronic pain but has no choice
but to work a 10 hour shift and then
come home into cooking clean in those 10
hours she can't pull up a chair do some
dishes throw pasta in a pot throw some
clothes in a machine maybe scrub the
floors a little bit maybe do the taxes
really maybe
dust do a little dusting maybe she could
take some of those heavy boxes down to
the garage
[Laughter]
do the responsible thing do the adult
thing boring
not the [ __ ] I'm going to try to say
this as gently as possible it doesn't
sound like you two should be having a
kid all right
um that's the problem ocean spice that's
the kind of you don't really have to
type that at this point they're in the
third trimester it's uh
kind of in it for the the Long Haul at
this point
not the [ __ ] I don't understand why
anyone would quit their job when they
find out they're pregnant unless she's
on doctor's ordered bed rest this is a
bad plan she should be saving her
paycheck for everything the baby will
need
kind of kind of a hot take I sort of
agree although
listen
I'm a man I shouldn't be saying this
stuff
I think you can work in the second
trimester
the first even the first trimester
if if we stopped people from working
during the first trimester we'd lose all
those great sitcom moments where ladies
at work and she throws up and then her
co-worker who's like a little snarky but
everyone loves her even though she
drinks a little too much would be like
you know you might be pregnant and then
she'd be like no that's not and then she
thinks back to win her and Mr Sheffield
the plane was gonna crash and then they
and and so and then she's like my God
maybe I am pregnant
you know I and we can't lose those
moments those are the Hallmarks of
Western media
what are you talking about listen I did
I also read a post on our slash [ __ ] mom
group say last night that made me laugh
where a woman said that her and her
husband
both quit their job because their kid
was teething
it's like
what the hell
they're like our kid has really been
having a hard time with teething so my
husband and I both quit our jobs I was
like
teething's not easy but can I tell you
that is not if you were looking at like
a graph of even only with like a
two-year-old right now the hardest parts
of being a two-year-old teething doesn't
even register you wouldn't even get like
a like a push alert on your phone on
that day
good for them well but then in their
post they were like we were thinking
about starting a restaurant or a cafe or
something like that so we have more time
um and I was like oh no they're stupid
haven't you ever seen Kitchen Nightmares
okay everybody sucks here everything's
hard yeah yeah come on come on come on
come on
come on give me something crazy give me
something crazy
everybody sucks here this isn't the Pain
Olympics
come on give me some of the cold hit me
hit me I want you to hear me come on
all right whatever
couldn't get it
there's not enough craziness
a pretty spicy reactor today though am I
the [ __ ] for lying about a food
allergy oh no they're vegan
if the if they're a nine-year-old vegan
woman red is going to eviscerate them
man
um the Reddit hierarchy of [ __ ] rolling
downhill is like it's got to be like
old maybe
vegan
teenagers
landlord I don't know but on am I the
[ __ ] I don't know
am I the [ __ ] people really respect
homeowners they like they're they're big
about like you know it's you you're
you're it's your home you are the king
of the castle you are the you're the
lord of the Fife you make the rules
the [ __ ] for lying about a food
allergy I'm vegan have been for over
five years I'm lucky to live in a major
city okay Reddit is like they're gear
they're gearing up for one of these it
lives in a major city vegan for five
years let me guess good job
two supportive parents check one of
those
with a plethora of entirely or partially
vegan restaurants but when I visit my
family in rural Pennsylvania my options
become non-existent attitudes towards
veganism here range from ignorance to
outright hostility I try to avoid eating
out with my family when I'm home at all
costs but sometimes it simply isn't
avoidable for example my sister's
wedding rehearsal dinner
my sister had her dinner at the foremost
fine dining establishment in the town
it's a big old Tavern that builds itself
as a French influenced Steakhouse
menu fair is every imaginable cut of
steak drowned in butter with some
chicken and fish drowned butter plus
sides of veggies and mashed potatoes
that are yes smothered in butter the one
or two vegetarian dishes are buttered
and drowned in creamy sauce
given that my little brother used to
weigh tables here I know they frowned
upon substitutions and don't use much
veggie oil for the sake of quality okay
I've had two negative experiences here I
tried to explain my vegan diet my first
time here in depth yet my sad little
plate of steamed broccoli was drizzled
with butter and my iceberg lettuce salad
came with ranch the second time a chef
came out personally and promised me his
tomato pasta dish was vegan only tomato
only for me to find out they swirled
parmesan cheese into the red sauce to
disguise they accidentally sprinkled it
on top
that incident broke my trust completely
sounds kind of good with it though like
I can understand why you would be
concerned it sounds kind of tasty with
it to be honest it would it sucks for
you but it wouldn't suck for me I think
is what I'm gonna say
for my sister's dinner I called ahead
told the chef I have life-threatening
food allergies to meat proteins Dairy
and egg
they were like uh-huh sure you do
why don't you just say you're vegan
because
I was served a dish of plain pasta with
salt and pepper with fruit which sucked
but I appreciated the consideration for
those allergies though they had to scrub
down the whole kitchen clean the fryers
check the ingredients list of their
products that prep apparently costs them
an extra two hours and I didn't realize
this they charged my parents who are
paying for the rehearsal an extra
several hundred dollars for their time
my sister and parents are livid I
already sent my mom to several hundred
needed to cover the extra cost but
they're upset at me for lying and
humiliating the chef in the restaurant
whom they have close ties to my sister's
wedding is this weekend and something
tells me is going to be tense personally
I think if this restaurant is going to
continue with their ignorance and
inconsideration they're getting what
they deserve am I the [ __ ] for
ensuring my needs are met okay
um
not not the [ __ ] in some ways listen
you should never lie sometimes
everybody knows this
rather than lie to the restaurant
they could have been like
I'm just not gonna have a meal at the
rehearsal I'm just gonna have wine
oh I'm gonna eat before or maybe I'm
gonna bring like a vegan protein bar in
my pocket or something like that right
it's not a huge deal
that would have been the right way
to solve it that being said I can also
see
why she would lie about it since her
trust was betrayed a couple of times
couldn't she have just lied and said she
gets like horrendous early onset like
diarrhea or something like that
shouldn't have to say is lethal
like that puts a lot of onus on the
restaurant
she couldn't be like if I eat any of
these things I will instantly poop my
pants in your expensive boots
then they probably would have just they
wouldn't have done the cleaning maybe
but they would have respected their
dietary concerns I think
but I don't think she's an [ __ ] in
this situation
especially because she paid for the
extra cleaning like most people at least
on Reddit it would have been like my
parents paid for it I told them I don't
think it's my fault that they paid for
it when I would never have paid for it
if the restaurant had asked me to do
that you know like I
also I is this really this can't be like
a common practice right that
oh sure you want to have some plain
pasta at the restaurant that's no
problem that'll just be the cost of the
pasta it's around 23 bucks uh and also
400 bucks for the cleaning fee like that
I don't think that that makes any sense
that doesn't pass the sauce detection
but she paid it anyway
Joe kangaroo 27 thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
she should have just not eaten Eden
before eaten after
but I do understand why she lied and I
think post-lie situation and and
consequences
I think they handled it well so I would
like to say not the [ __ ] apparently
they're the [ __ ] though because on
Reddit
we don't like vegans for one and then
nobody should ever under any
circumstances lie unless Del ball and
chain asked you if her ass looks fat in
that dress in which case you say of
course you did not know it would never
and that's it yeah okay let's see let's
see if the prediction is right here
you're the [ __ ]
hi someone with oh here we go someone
with the moral High Ground
hi someone with an actual food allergy
lactose and potentially gluten please
don't use unconditioned that Canon is
life-threatening to make your life
easier also you their job 10x harder
holy crap this is my most liked comment
yay edit two my allergies are not
life-threatening but they are a pain in
the assets
hi someone with one point question mark
food allergies here please don't pretend
to have food allergies that are
life-threatening I mine aren't but some
peoples are thanks for the Reddit
comment or Reddit comment
100 this proud 20-year vegan here and
the parent of a child with
life-threatening butt allergies what
excuse me
your child is a life-threatening butt
allergy
I don't understand oh no
oh man
people who lie about this to get their
way literally make my blood boil
no they don't but I get that it makes
you angry which is also fine I
understand bring your own food this is
not a vegan restaurant you can't expect
the steakhouse to cater to your vegan
requirements I think that's definitely
fair I mean this is not an unfair
comment in my opinion
you're the [ __ ] and this really got
me
personally I think that if this
restaurant is going to continue with
their ignorance and inconsideration they
got what they deserved this sort of
attitude is what makes many people hate
vegans okay I mean that's also not
unfair I'm sorry to say I donate vegans
at all and I as someone who was it was
12 years ago I was a vegetarian myself
for like six months mouth and I did it
because we both bet each other that we
couldn't and then I was introduced to a
lot of great cuisine as a result to this
day I I would eat less meat if we could
get the whole household on the same page
there also with the baby sometimes it's
just beef he's beefing chicken are kind
of like a Wonder food when you're
actually like growing
it like one little piece of meat has got
lots of vitamins and minerals anyway the
point is
that's not the point when I was a
vegetarian I realized shoot was it's
actually like really annoying because
sometimes you'll just be like minding
your own business you'll like go to a
barbecue you'll bring a salad people be
like why do you have that salad you'd be
like Oh I'm a vegetarian then they would
get on your ass because they have a
preconceived notion that you get on
their ass like they would almost be like
threatened by your dietary Choice like
you think you're better than them or
something and you're like I'm really
just trying to like eat my salad oh does
this make you jealous
steak is so juicy
like when you actually don't care
so I think people have this idea
sometimes that like all vegetarians and
vegans have a position of moral
superiority and like turn up their nose
and people who eat meat when I think in
reality that's a very small percentage
of people like that especially as it's
kind of grown as a as a habit most of
the people are just like normal people
who want to you know they just make
their own dietary choices for whatever
reason environmental health or ethical
or whatever and then they just want to
be like kind of like left alone
without having people be like you know
well you're going to get a garden salad
I'm gonna order two steaks just to make
okay well then [ __ ] fine who cares I
don't know die of heart disease I don't
like I actually don't care I'm just here
to eat something
owned I'm so owned
clogging my arteries to own you because
you're eating a a salad it doesn't make
any sense it's very weird
anyway
anti-vegan rhetoric is like is is a very
cringe like 2010s era bit
maybe even late 2000s
you're the [ __ ] for lying and saying
they got what they deserved that being
said I do think
[Laughter]
yep oh no a bullet list we skip those
you're the [ __ ] people like you are
white people with real life-threatening
food allergies aren't taken seriously is
that true or do you just want them to
feel bad because that doesn't seem right
it seems like they took her food allergy
seriously
and I don't see read anything in her
post that is like an indication that
they're not going to take it seriously
next time especially if they get paid
like a few hundred extra bucks to clean
their kitchen
that seems like a win-win
who doesn't take life-threatening
allergies seriously I don't even want to
go here okay but there are people
like people I I hate and a lot of
stand-up comedians have a joke like this
that's like you know
I was on an airplane and I was eating a
peanut butter sandwich and the
stewardess came over and told me that I
can't eat peanut butter because someone
on the plane has a nut allergy and I
said well that's too bad for them you
know sometimes something if your genes
are this bad maybe you shouldn't even
like just telling people that like their
kids should be dead because they can't
eat peanuts meanwhile being like 40
pounds overweight themselves like it's
it's just a a bit of a double standard
for a long time I've been like I may
enjoy the rest of the special but that
bit itself is like it to me it's kind of
a bad look that you're like I should be
allowed to eat peanut butter wherever I
want even if it does kill somebody's kid
so I I think people do take food
allergies seriously but maybe even still
not as seriously as they uh as they
could
like we actually had a situation at our
daycare where we got a text from one of
the parents because we brought in like
cookies one day and then the parent was
like hey can you send me a screenshot of
like the ingredient list of those
cookies we need to see if they have
hazelnuts or walnuts in them luckily
they didn't but it was like a nice
wake-up call because I was like man I
didn't even think about that
like I didn't even think about looking
at the ingredient list before we I was
just like we're doing a nice thing
sending cookies to the daycare
now uh I'm like I'm sending [ __ ]
nothing
nobody's getting anything nice anymore
and that's fair I they would probably
rather not get anything nice than be
killed by a food allergy but
peanuts I'm like we gotta watch out for
peanuts I didn't even think about the
hazelnuts and the walnuts and the
almonds and the and the so ons and the
so forth but anyway
you could have just asked for a garden
salad with the dressing on the side
Jesus Christ you give us vegans
vegetarians or bad name and not
and not be
but they tried to do that a couple of
times at the restaurant and the
restaurant didn't respect their dietary
concerns they put butter on her like
parmesan cheese or something like that
so that's why she thought she would then
go to the next level
oh no
oh no this is okay
as a former server in both casual and
fine dining restaurants in a major U.S
Metropolis that restaurant is absurd
they give you pasta and fruit what did
they heck why the heck did they need to
clean multiple fryers it makes no sense
they called it in the kitchen deep clean
but they didn't have the foresight to
play in a single dish and no which
extremely limited items it appears to be
an establishment run by freaking idiots
is fair
all right
I mean I don't think they really I I
soft you're the [ __ ] soft you're the
[ __ ] okay
that's it's like a Curb Your Enthusiasm
episode Larry uh is talking to Larry's
dating someone way out of his League
let's say
um
Cameron Diaz returns to acting on their
Date Cameron Diaz says oh I love that
place but like Larry's like why don't we
go to aritzia and then Cameron Diaz is
like I love that place but I can't go
back ever since I turned vegan they have
animal products and all their food even
when I ask for them to not have any
animal products Larry goes why don't you
just lie and tell them that if you eat
any butter it'll kill you and then
Cameron hi
don't talk to me Larry what did I do you
know your your little bright idea with
telling them I'm deathly allergic to
butter well they had to close down the
restaurant because uh they had to do
three hours of deep cleaning and then
they put it on my bill at the end
Cameron how could I have known that
could that I mean that's not like a
season four Golden Age curve bit
[ __ ] you Larry
but that's like a season 12 that could
be a season 12.
[ __ ] you you bald prick
and hey Larry don't call me
anyway
um scrolling just just coming down from
that one for a second I'm just scrolling
just scrolling
am I the [ __ ] for asking my husband's
friend if he was going to bring his
wife's ashes when he moves in with us
what the hell is
what
I guess I shouldn't laugh but
kind of a it's a very bold statement
my husband's friend lost his wife four
months ago he had cremated and used to
keep her ashes in their home he
unfortunately had to lose his home to
medical debts and asked me and my
husband to let him move in with us and
stay for a few weeks till he figures it
out
I'd like to go back to the home page now
I'm not having any fun
he told us this during dinner my husband
said of course we'd welcome him to move
in and stay in our house I for some
reason kept thinking about his wife's
ashes now I'm not a I'm not a fan
cremation but obviously I can't control
how others choose to honor their
deceased loved ones as much as I would
like to
but still seeing ashes or being around
them gives off weird Vibes that I cannot
control I decided TJ speech up and asked
his friend if he was going to bring his
wife's ashes as well his friend got
quiet and my husband gave him a death
stare my friend left and then my HUD
band blew up asking what the hell
possessed me to ask such question I told
him I was just inquiring about the ashes
since he knows how I feel about it he
said this came across as insensitive and
unwelcoming towards not just his friend
but his deceased wife as well we had an
argument and he called me cruel and
Reckless to speak to his friend the way
I did he said I should never have
brought it up he told me to get over
myself and not expect his friend to part
with his wife just because I'm
uncomfortable
we argued some more and he told me to
apologize next time I see his friend for
the disrespect that displayed but in my
opinion he made a big deal out of a
question
um
yeah you're the [ __ ]
for sure
this this feels like another Curb Your
Enthusiasm bit honestly
you're gonna bring the ashes
yes Larry
I'm gonna bring the ashes you know
that's my wife
I'm picturing like an Albert Brooks type
maybe in that role playing himself
um
dude honestly my mom was talking to me
when she was here she was like and she
was I felt bad because she was like she
thought it was a great idea and maybe it
is maybe I have no vision
but she was saying you know instead of
being cremated these days a lot of
people are choosing to and I don't know
what the word is I think she called it
wet cremation
where they basically just kind of get
put in like a sous-vide
until they get sort of like like all
their
all their flesh gets yeah aquamated
that's it you can put in like a a warm
bath
and sous vide until like all of your
flesh disintegrates and then they just
sort of like grind up your bones
and she was like it's great because
there's like less emissions from like
the cremator and stuff like that and I I
swear to you that what I said was
I don't care about the emissions from
the cremator because I'm dead that's
like one even in death
I can't be a little laissez-faire about
my carbon footprint
like people are driving gas cars they're
taking huge road trips you're gonna
guilt-trip me for being cremated
once sorry maybe we cremated like I'm
not gonna make a habit of it
what percentage of a person's lifetime
CO2 emissions come from cremation it's
got to be like one one
millionth probably
plus I'm dead like isn't that like the
greatest deal of all time I emit a
little carbon dioxide and then no more
ever again
it's insanely good for the environment
now I'm my my personal belief is like
also I didn't use the incinerator the
person running the incinerator used it
all I did was die I'm not going to take
responsibility for the pollution from
the incinerator
they're the one who shoveled all the
coal into it or whatever I just had the
audacity to die in their jurisdiction
regardless you know I I
I'm not really that fussed about what
happens to my body after I die but like
if you're giving me the choice between
cremation or uh being slow boiled in an
aluminum vat I really would choose the
cremation that's I'm gonna be I'm gonna
be a little stick because I I I don't
know it was just in my head like in the
furnace I'm already dead
I'm sitting there and it's kind of like
a viking funeral right and then I'm like
turning into Ash but like me like my
body like slow boiling and like my skin
slowly like sloughing off and stuff like
that and like my eyeballs falling out
I'm like what if the they didn't hinge
the door properly and it like opens up
and then I kind of like I'm half soupy
and I spill out of the front door or
something like that just just put me in
the you could do like a pizza at the
same time or something
you can put me next to the pizza
you can multi you could do some batch
tasking but like
don't put me in the don't put me in the
slow boiler man
I don't want it's just I don't know I'm
maybe I'm maybe I'm old-fashioned but
it's just like a little gross you don't
have to bury me I'm not worried about
that I don't think I'm ever busting out
of the casket or whatever but like I
don't want to I Don't Wanna Be sous vide
and reverse seared okay it's just I I'm
pretty open-minded but that one's just
you could do it it doesn't bother me
that it's being done I just personally
don't want it done to myself
anyway what were you talking about
oh yeah no obviously this person is
insane
it's not like that he's not gonna spread
the ashes like all over your house it's
just gonna sit in like an urn on the
fireplace mantle until jigsy jigsy the
Mario and knocks it over and then is it
is that from Meet the Parents
that is from Meet the Parents right
yeah okay anyway there's not much left
of Mind there moving on

you donkey it's disgusting
he's licking it
it tastes as bad as it looks
am I the [ __ ] for telling my sister I
didn't appreciate her leaving her baby
with us when we were about to leave to
go to the bathroom I can't even
understand what the [ __ ] you're saying
what there's like 27 commas in the in
the sentence that changed the meaning
depending on how you interpret them
who's going to the bathroom you or the
baby or the sister
am I the [ __ ] for telling my sister I
didn't appreciate her leaving her baby
with us when we were about to leave to
go to the bathroom
when we were about to leave to go to the
bathroom
me and my sister Sarah are on good terms
but we aren't close by any means
we see each other during family events
and things like that and text
occasionally but that's about it one of
my cousin's kids turned one so a few
days ago they had a birthday party and
invited friends and family I'm like oh
[ __ ] is this about us are they changing
the name
hahaha
but they've changed the names it
couldn't possibly be us
so every okay well done Sarah had a
three-month-old daughter and Sarah was
at the party she came later and we
chatted a little bit so everyone was
starting to leave
me and my husband Alex were also about
to leave when Sarah came up to me and
asked if I could keep an eye on my niece
for a few minutes while she ran to the
bathroom now I want to add I don't have
an issue with this specifically
an award for uh selfless citizen of the
year goes to
I don't have a problem with looking
after my niece for two minutes so my
sister can take a dump
my problem was that she saw we were
about to go yet she left without waiting
for our answer yeah because if you said
no she's gonna have to hold in her her
dookie for like two hours
why don't you just delay going for it's
just gotta run to the bathroom real
quick there's no she's it's let me keep
reading
after she came back I told her I didn't
really appreciate her leaving like that
without even waiting for an answer I
said there were still a few other people
around she could have asked who weren't
leaving you're her sister though like
that's the it's the way obligation flows
it flows from closest relationship to
closest relationship
when asked like your your co-worker's
husband to look after your kid for like
a minute
if it flows in the other direction
Sarah replied she didn't really think of
think it through and saw me so she came
to me this isn't the first time Sarah's
pulled things like this not with me
particularly then why are you bringing
it up
this isn't the first time my sister's
been completely normal
not with me but with our parents who
bend over backwards to do favors for her
shout this sounds exactly like a middle
child situation
I do understand the situation under
circumstances you want you understand
I'm sorry to get so stunlocked you
understand that people have to go to the
bathroom on occasion
I do understand the situation and her
circumstances Now with an infant but
there's a limit man and the limit is
zero because of one
I'm gonna kick up a damn fuss
I get it but maybe she should think
things through for once she started
crying and said she's very overwhelmed
we ended up leaving after that and I do
feel kind of bad for what I said to her
but I don't think it warranted crying
Alex agrees with me that Sarah was
overreacting a little bit so am I the
[ __ ] oh wow
you're crazy
you do not like your sister this is
turning me into a redditor
is literally like the biggest not a deal
of all time
hey uh honey you want to leave the party
yeah sure let me just talk to my sister
for a second hey uh I gotta take a I
gotta I gotta take a number one can you
look after your niece for 45 seconds
[Laughter]
this is what happens when you get
um socially maladjusted loner with a
society who just shits on them over and
over like did nothing happen you just
gotta look after a kid for like
for like less than the length of time of
a Guided by Voices song it's nothing
it's it's nothing at all like it's a
completely mundane situation
I sentence you to get a life
find God you're the [ __ ] it took
longer for you to write this out than it
did to just wait for her to pee yes
that's correct
find God
autocorrect I'm so crazy she did not ask
you to eat her niece
I don't need to read the rest are you
serious bro yes you're the [ __ ]
she went to use the bathroom for a few
minutes she didn't even leave the house
and staying a few extra minutes actually
heard you just admit you don't like your
sister and everything she does annoys
you man this is crazy
you're the [ __ ] do you have a habit
of making big deals out of little
inconveniences oh man she's in trouble
you really had to criticize her for
asking her sister for a quick favor then
you had a go at her your sister with a
three-month-old likely sleep deprived
crying and you criticized her are you
serious hard you're the [ __ ]
how dare she
okay well hold on
I understand you two aren't close and
it's not her fault you sound cold and
jealous yes this
I got that jealous and bitter vibe from
this post too look listen
you don't need well excuse me maybe you
do need edit I read from your comment
that your sister's husband passed away
while she was pregnant and you were
bitter her parents were helping her
through her grief you were salty because
your mom canceled your lunch date
because her grief therapy was
rescheduled uh I now believe that this
is a a fictional post I now believe that
this is a fictional post
I believe that this was a creative
writing assignment
designed to create the worst person in
the world
one of the
dumbest legal Minds I've ever known
so are all of them yeah but I know all
the posts on am I the [ __ ] are fake
but what about what if this one was real
am I the [ __ ] for getting upset
because my wife wants two days off a
week
I'm very frustrated as I write this
I've been with my wife
for 15 years we're both 33 years old and
have two wonderful children both very
young we are both Professionals in our
community and earn good wages but like
many people money is often tighter than
I would like
when we had our first child my wife
decided to take a part-time job at her
workplace
we had extensive conversations and had
agreed that two days off a week would be
beneficial for getting things done
otherwise we would struggle we both work
eight to four okay it's very reasonable
except okay part-time wait that's me
foreign
I would classify her as full-time what
would I say is full-time work I would
say anything over
um
9 A.M
anything over 901 am to 2 P.M Monday to
Friday
that would be full time and should be
considered equivalent to any other
full-time job in terms of
output and Merit personally
yeah I would say as long as you're over
like
20
24 hours and 55 minutes a week of course
we're not counting federal holidays like
for example at Thanksgiving in that
so I would say
I would say she's like a I would say
she's full I would say she's working
time and a half honestly quite frankly
with both of our children she has taken
18 month maternity leave so we are
nearing the end of her last leave as
such money is especially tight and some
things have fallen off like household
tasks because having two kids is a bit
of a lifestyle change so true so true
we both agree it would be great for her
to return to work part-time but got into
an argument today today she told me she
volunteered for the PTA starting in
January so she can go into my son's
school on her off days this was a bit
triggering for me because I feel the
day's offer for her to complete tasks
that we often don't have time for
um
that's not a great sentence
but honey haven't you considered that
your days off are to do the housework
that's gonna I'm I think it's possible
that she did not consider uh
that the same way that that you did
sorry
moving on
I told her that much and I feel I'm very
polite in what I said I did reference
household chores like laundry dishes
vacuuming and whatnot it was not to be
misogynistic but our family does happen
to follow the stereotypical archaic
family structure where we have a
partially stay-at-home mom and me
working full-time plus overtime
occasionally
as your
PR representative before you put this
one out there I'm going to advise you to
just put a strike through the last
couple of sentences there I don't
believe that this person is a misogynist
that nothing about what they're saying
is misogynistic as far as I can tell
but just the way that they wrote I don't
mean this misogynistically but we do
happen to embody the lifestyle from a
very misogynistic time
it it makes your case a little weaker
it invites the appearance of you to be a
misogynist which is is not necessary
given the content of the post so far
anytime you say I'm not this but you may
not be that you have to see what comes
after the next part of the sentence but
people are predisposed to think that
everything that comes after the bud
nullifies the thing that you said first
like I'm not a serial killer but
I do enjoy watching Ted Bundy
documentaries
I'm not a serial killer
the thing that came after it doesn't
make me a serial killer but people are
like oh [ __ ] investigate him
I just like it because he's I'm not
going to say because he's such a hottie
have I done the bit yet where in every
Ted Bundy documentary they're like a
disarmingly handsome man asked me if I
could help him with his bag and then
they show a photo of Ted Bundy and he's
like
you just had a certain animal magnetism
he wasn't like other serial killers like
he was he was approachable he was nice
he was a hottie
sorry
I'm moving on
the climax of this argument was my wife
getting irate and telling me that I
couldn't tell her what she could do on
her days off I reminded her they were
not days off but rather an agreement
where she works part-time but gets our
family tasks done what
hey this is so now like all right listen
listen
why you think you guys so much control
over your wife's time
like I can understand where he's coming
from he's like my wife's been on
maternity leave so there's like a reason
that things are kind of in disarray
right now it's a lot of work to raise
kids you know money's tight we're going
back to a previous Arrangement before
but why I just don't understand why he
thinks that he's in control of his
wife's free time
that he's like yeah you can take as many
days off as you want as long as you
clean the entire house the whole time
he might not be a misogynist he might
just hate his wife
there's nothing in here that says he
hates all women he might just hate the
one that he chose to spend the rest of
his life with and have two kids
we got to give him the benefit of the
doubt okay
no that's even too far but
I reminded her that your days off are
not days off but rather an agreement
between myself and myself where you work
part-time but get our family tasked on
she feels I'm being overbearing she
doesn't want to sign up for that but she
doesn't want to return to full-time work
either
I'm not trying to be rude or ignorant
but I'm frustrated I feel if she wants
to volunteer at my son's school and make
a commitment she should be taking extra
shifts and making more money for the
family first also if she's going to stay
part-time she needs to accept that
family responsibility comes first
am I being an [ __ ] I feel like she's
being selfish by wanting full control of
her days off while not working full-time
I don't know if I'm right or wrong here
I'm struggling to understand her
perspective
okay well let's let's read the
the edits first
info sorry I didn't use PTA properly
it's volunteering throughout the week of
school I know PTA is one hour a month
it's not the meeting is the assignments
volunteering and commitments she's
making throughout the week roughly four
hours a day on her days off
that's a lot but at the same time
it means she's also got like 12 hours of
other time
I don't mean that to say like she should
that's what that seems like has plenty
of time to make the place spotless I'm
just saying like you know she could
still I don't understand why that seems
like
he thinks that she's unable to maintain
the standards of the household then
I mean it seems like it's a lot of time
for
volunteering but like it's for a good
cause
it looks like I'm the [ __ ] I need to
reevaluate priorities and apologize to
my wife I appreciate the feedback edit
too apparently I don't articulate myself
well she works Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday she has Friday Saturday Sunday
Monday off four days off I guess but we
work on things together on the weekend
which is why I said too
this guy really the kind of it's a kind
of [ __ ] to be like um it wasn't
a real day off because I did the dishes
what the hell are you talking about
welcome to being an adult and having
some kids you know especially
it's Sunday
put on your work boots you're doing
family work today
you're still it's still labored
in many ways you're just not wearing a
uniform unless you're tucking your uh
your genes into your new balances like I
do
I'm not a part-time dad I do every chore
she does just as she does every chore I
do this sounds like you're doing twice
as many chores as is necessary
we work together and have a great
marriage this was just a disagreement I
wasn't trying to divorce her or murder
her
for the decision not everything is a
major thing well you're the one who made
the posts
Poindexter
nobody nobody broke into your house and
and posted on Reddit under a throwaway
so here's what I'll say first
we start out reasonable and get brought
to the extremes by the comments
I'm not saying he has a point
but
well no I don't really have a I'm not
saying he has a point at all
because like
what I was going to say is you don't
really get to have a two as many you
don't it's hard to have if after you've
made the adult decision to have kids you
don't get to necessarily have
as many pre-planned 100 don't get inside
of my leisure bubble days off
you can plan it as much as you want
things come up sometimes you need help
sometimes you need to hey can you watch
it for two minutes while I go to the
bathroom sister you know etc etc but it
doesn't seem like she's doing this at
all
it seems like her husband is mad that
the house is in like perfectly tidy
and then
she's like I'm gonna volunteer at our
son's school
and then he's like
but when are you gonna have time to
vacuum like that seems like an argument
that you can't win
unless I'm misreading the post
oh I guess he's also saying
if you have this kind of time to
volunteer you could also be working more
which is a fair statement I just don't
know why it's also filtered through
our house is a little bit dirty like I'm
it's just weird right like
I think it's fair that if they have
money problems he's like I would rather
you work more than volunteer
I'm not saying it means that he's right
but I think it's a it's a fair thing to
bring up I guess
but I also I don't know I think
especially like
when you have a spouse I think you have
to sort of trust them that you're doing
right by them and they're doing right by
you
instead of what he seems to be doing
which is like he's keeping a ledger in
his head of like all the stuff that he's
doing and then he's comparing it to The
Ledger of what he sees his spouse doing
and he's like well there's an imbalance
here I'm doing more I think he needs to
you you would do better in most
circumstances if you looked at it and
you went well I think that we're both
trying our best and occasionally getting
overwhelmed and doing less for a day or
two days because we need to recover a
little bit and then recovering from that
and then getting back to that standard
in like a couple days
that makes that makes more sense to me
than this this weird vibe that he's
giving off
but maybe I don't know maybe I'm the
crazy one but it's kind of a crazy world
these days
also I know you've said this before I do
think that maybe it depends on the job
but like
my job is definitely easier than looking
after a toddler much less a baby
I mean like a a newborn baby is a and
here's a little secret for you a newborn
baby is actually like pretty easy to
look after if you're the father
or that if you're not the mother let me
put it that way
mom's got a nurse all the time it's a
whole production I don't really get it
as a dad sure you gotta wake up in the
middle of the night sometimes and do
like a bottle feed but when the baby is
not hungry or upset they just sit in
like a little like baby chair and they
just sort of go like this
and you'd be like oh I looked after the
baby for like six hours today mostly I
was just playing like a [ __ ] ton of
Rocket League
that's about it
then they get a little older than that
especially when they start crawling and
walking then it becomes like tough
tougher at least
but my job is definitely easier than
looking after my kid like five hours of
streaming I'm like I'm a little hungry
five hours like looking after my
daughter's solo I'm like I need a damn
nap
and I'm not a the kind of guy that naps
to begin with
but regardless all I'm trying to say is
that it seems like he's like I'm busting
my ass at work and sure maybe he works
at like the fire Factory where he's got
to grab fire out of a out of a a raging
Inferno with his bare hands and like I
don't know what he does but she's on Mad
leave with two kids she's probably also
working herself to the damn bone
so he he probably comes home he's like
why isn't the house clean I was at work
all day and she he probably comes home
and she's like why don't you have a damn
better job that gives you more time off
why didn't you apply yourself more in
your younger years when you have more
energy and then you could have had more
flexibility at work it could be helping
me out at home right now
like they're they're both they're both
probably putting in good effort is what
I'm trying to say
so the argument that's like
you know while I was working when you
were just at home looking after the kids
is like you're not gonna you're not
gonna get too far with that I think
I don't know or maybe she just sucks I
suppose
there is a caveat she might just be like
a little lazy but I don't assume that
about her that's what her husband's
saying which is pretty rude
why am I a bigger fan of your wife than
you are you're the one who married her
dummy anyway let's see some comments
you're the [ __ ] kids don't raise
themselves your wife's getting involved
with their schooling in the parenting
Community she's not having bottomless
mimosas during this time how do you know
do you have like a like a a nanny cam
you don't Maybe
now and then maybe
one day a week maybe
It's Five O'Clock Somewhere glass of
white zinfandel at 11 A.M kids are down
for nap time
you never know and you know what good
for her I love that for her
listen your kids are small one day
they'll be grown do you think they'll
remember whether the floor was vacuums
and the windows were washed
or do you think they'll remember their
mom was there for them some of my best
times were volunteering at my kids
schools and they'd tell you the same
don't take that away from your wife and
kids if you can try to carve more time
for yourself to be there for them too
you won't regret it even if the
baseboards are dirty they'll remember
that you showed up so true
Jesus you didn't have to go right for my
emotions LOL it's him well spoken thank
you for taking the time to write that
it's an awesome perspective I'd never
consider that before I might be focusing
on the wrong aspects of my life I'll go
for the Sucker Punch then all right
here we go
laugh
you have two types of currency to manage
the monetary and the emotional please
take care to balance them now obviously
you have to work and cover the bills and
stuff but in my experience fathers they
lose sight of what they're working for
they work and work and work to give
their kids everything and the best and
that's not flawed but I promise
sometimes you can do their best without
everything from my personal experiences
we had a great childhood big Christmases
family trips to Disney a couple times
cable
cables
the first house on the block with a
dedicated landline for the internet we
had a lot no what we didn't have my dad
home much at all we could have gone with
you're absolutely right you could have
gone with less to have more if your
father had been less successful at his
job you would have gotten the internet
later and then you wouldn't be here
making this crazy dude 500 word essay
that when the guy apologized
he already apologized
I did thank you for the awards I
actually just talked to my dad and I
told him about this post saying his
redditor just dropped Hey Dad I just
wanted to tell you about a post I made
on Reddit this morning
oh it really son that's cool
he was working under the wrong devotion
and at the time he thought he was making
the best choices but looking back he
sees a lot of regrets and missed chances
of opportunities he sees all the things
that didn't see as important then and
wishes he'd done things differently and
made more time for the things that
mattered such as being home with the
kids we also both teared up over some of
the memories mentioned here so his his
with a capital H is God your father is
God this message is from Jesus Christ
himself
I had no idea I take back all that
[ __ ] up [ __ ] I said about you getting
the internet too early
don't be him waiting until he's don't
don't be like my dad waiting until he's
retired and looking back and wishing you
could do it all over the right way
listen listen listen listen listen
listen listen
true but also like people gotta [ __ ]
like
they gotta work like I don't mean you
could all okay like pull it back a
little like this is saying like you
never get that time back when you're
when your kid is little so make the most
of it yeah but like you can still also
like
work
I mean like I'm in a different situation
because I have so much flexibility but
I'm just like
one I I just think that it's maybe a
they're going a little bit too far to
the extreme this is hey when you're home
on a at nights and on the weekends be
active in your child's life don't be
looking at your phone going that's great
honey
of course but
you don't have to like I don't know move
down to part-time work
to spend more time with your child just
so like I think you're going to have
that quality time in a in a normal
balance as well
anyway regardless
I saved this to read to my husband in
the morning him working so much has been
an issue of contention for the past
several years I'm going to pour one out
for this guy's husband
or for this this person's husband
because I think I would can you imagine
you have a child with someone and then
you wake up in the morning you're like
five and a half hours of sleep you're
stressed out I got all this [ __ ] to do
today
honey I just want to read you something
real quick it's
um a 1500 word essay from Reddit about
how you're a bad father
that was
ah yeah uh-huh uh-huh no you know what
they make some good yeah they make some
good points I'll think about that
this is a sad story man
I I'm putting myself in this I don't
even know if this person is real and I'm
putting myself in their shoes and I'm
I'm now I'm sad
good luck all of this is emotional to
read just as a bystander what the [ __ ]
are you talking about
as an empath this stuff is hard to read
no it's not
I'm hitting like uh like empathy fatigue
on these posts what do you mean is if
this is uh no I'm because you're turning
me into a boomer if this [ __ ] is hard to
read get ready to go through live
closing your damn eyes man because it's
just like a relatively normal situation
I mean not typical but like pretty
common
like I'm sorry if you gotta go like a
bit of a damn spine okay
it doesn't have to be made out of
animantium
but you've got to be able to at least
read a second hand story of a dad
spending a little too little time with
his kid without it withering you to the
damn core
makes me sick
comment deleted by user welcome to
American [ __ ] laws
info I know what this is is this really
considered part-time work
anyway you know what I think we made it
we made it through
oh man
there's a good
CEO so much I honestly thought we would
uh do like an hour and then go back and
play uh
go back and play some Dome



you know I I I'm not saying that Austin
Powers one is the best comedy ever made
it's not even the best comedy of the 90s
it's probably not even the best comedy
of 1997.
but I was thinking about how so many of
the quotes live in my head completely
rent free like I was thinking last night
um I put the baby to sleep half an hour
later she woke up uh and she was crying
I checked out her room she'd thrown up a
little marinara sauce on her sleep sack
and on her mattress cover so I had to
strip the whole mattress down change the
Sleep sack I woke up Kade where's the
new mattress cover she's like the
mattress cover it was in the washing
machine so we had to get like a
swaddling blanket from when she was a
newborn and then we had to like
make it like a like a makeshift match
anyway long story short we got her back
in the in the crib and then uh she was
laying down and I kept trying like she'd
fall asleep and I would try to like get
my hand out of her hand
so I could escape and go to sleep myself
because I don't want to sleep on the
floor and uh she would always like just
give me the death grip even when she's
asleep
it was crazy and I kept thinking Austin
needs his hand back you know when he's
getting a call from basil exposition to
go visit a lot of vagina after his night
with Vanessa
and and the the phone goes
and then obvious so that's one Austin
Powers thing that lives in my head rent
free
um
whenever you take a long P that's like
Austin Powers when he's uh woken up from
the unfreezing process whenever
um you're you're trying to parallel park
but you can't get it quite right that's
Austin powersing like when he was in the
the golf cart and he can't seem to do
the three-point turn there's so much
stuff from that movie that like is has
seeped deep into the cultural Foundation
and that's only like three things I'm
thinking of right like one million
dollars there's so many
anyway we're doing react Court sorry we
I just thought it would be funny to
start by talking about Austin Powers
because I was thinking about it
it's a German bit excuse me germa gets
to most of his bits before me okay
however you can go back the um Dark
Souls 2
I'm trying to fight the Old Iron King
the run-up is the biggest nightmare of
all time I'm playing the Quincy Jones
Quincy Jones Bossa Nova Thriller
whatever the theme song's called
that's from like 2018 okay
that one's at the Austin Powers
infatuation is mine please Seoul Bossa
Nova that's what it's called
anyway it's react Court let's find the
most insane people on the internet one
of the least fine legal Minds the world
has ever known
you ready for this
it's probably this one full squid react
chord reel is probably this one
if I had the guess
that looks right am I the [ __ ] for
telling my husband to get over himself
when he started berating me for not
picking up his brother's son from school
so you're
first off
why are you putting on airs is the first
thing that I say here
your husband's brother's son is your
nephew
why are you trying to make it seem like
you're not related to this person
like whenever I talk about my nieces I
don't say my wife's sister's kids
they're my nieces it's like you're
trying to trick people into thinking
that like you don't have a relationship
with this kid but you do
you're you're their aunt
or their aunt as I like to say and then
I got over corrected by Korean children
when I was teaching ESL so now I'm
self-conscious about saying Aunt so I
say aunts and then people are like why
are you trying to be British and I'm
like I'm not the kids I taught in South
Korea had an Australian teacher and now
for the rest of my life I gotta say Aunt
because I'm sick of getting corrected by
nine-year-olds anyway
my husband 37 took his nephew in after
his dad my husband's brother was
diagnosed with cancer he told me that
his nephew would be staying with us till
his dad completes his chemo treatment I
agreed although he did not consult me
about it at first but I told him that
he'll be his responsibility not mine
sanest
um sanist spouse on Earth
are you crazy
talk about like main character syndrome
this is a 12 year old kid who is again
your nephew dealing with uh you know a
serious illness for his father and
you're like okay fine we can get it we
can get a kid but it'll be your
responsibility you're gonna have to walk
it you're gonna have to uh to clean its
poop up you're gonna have to take it to
the the kid vet or whatever they're
called
like this is crazy
he asked me to explain why and I told
him because he didn't consult me before
taking his nephew in and I'm not
equipped nor experienced in taking care
slash being committed to child care I
still have to cook and clean obviously
he said it was fine and he'd be taken
care of him on his own
the other day he called me in the
afternoon saying he was stuck in a
two-hour meeting and asked if I could go
pick up his nephew his nephew
that's your nephew lady what do you do
why are you writing it like this do you
think we're stupid like we could read
between the lines his nephew is your
nephew is is our nephew I said I was
having lunch with my mom and discussing
family issues he insisted I would remind
him
he was he insisted but I reminded him
that he said he'd be taking care of his
nephew including School pickup drop-off
I suggested he tried to get off work or
call some family member to go pick him
up
some family member like uh like maybe
like his uh spouse like the person who's
supposed to be on his team and all but
the most extreme issues possible uh he
tried to argue but I hung up okay so it
seems like an appropriate and adult
response to it I went home at three and
surprisingly found my husband there he
was angry he started yelling at me
calling me selfish and unfeeling I told
him his lack of management wasn't my
fault he yelled at me saying my lunch
with my mom could have [ __ ] waited
here's the thing I was on her husband's
side for a while I thought his wife was
acting
a little selfish a little juvenile
um but then apparently he said the f
word
and it's not even her nephew anyway so
now
it's a toss-up I mean sure this is a
serious issue I understand it's a
serious adult issue with adult
consequences
that's no reason to to use a word as
loaded as the f word I don't even want
to say it myself personally
like that's that that word it carries a
lot of power I would only use that in
serious situations like maybe like a
stand-up comedy routine or when my uh
when my favorite NHL team has set a new
NHL record by uh blowing a multiple goal
lead in four consecutive games to start
the season
but I chose to be effing Petty just to
prove a point I said that wasn't true
and told him to get over himself and
stop acting like he's the victim when he
put himself in this situation knowing he
wouldn't commit he wouldn't commit
he yelled that he was trying to do all
he can to help his brother out but it's
me who's playing the victim after I
refuse to help out we argued some more I
ended up going to stay with my mom for
the night he texted me some Choice words
that's when I turned my phone off I
can't uh can't help but notice every
single situation uh would you start to
have an argument you just disconnect
from it completely but maybe that's
something you could work on after the
the issue to begin with but
he'd I said my case he tried to argue
with me and I just closed my eyes and
covered my ears and said I can't hear
you
this threat is now locked due to an
excess of rule violations okay I mean
this is like a this is a warm-up you
know this is 20 to 40 resistance
80 to 100 Cadence like this is a gimme
obviously you're the [ __ ]
um
you know part of be you listen okay
I'm I'm kid pilled I have a child myself
so I sometimes I get accused of being a
little bit biased here but the beauty of
family is that you have support you have
stability you've always got people
around you help them they help you you
know and then two three times a year you
get together you have a nice meal of
either ham or turkey together
um you go out to a restaurant you argue
with the other family about who's going
to pay the bill it starts an arms race
they grab the bill out of your hands
when you're about to pay for it next
time you go out you say I'm gonna go to
the bathroom instead you go to the front
counter and say Hey I want to pay for
table seven over there when you get back
they're like thanks for paying next time
as soon as you sit down they're like
just so you know this gentleman already
called the restaurant and said he's
paying for everything I don't know what
happens after that I'm currently living
it you might have to purchase the
restaurant after that in order to ensure
that they can't steal the bill from you
it never ends but
regardless
that that's the beauty of family and
then the penalty is that you also have
to you know like John Lennon said the in
the end the love you make is equal to
the love you take so if you're or vice
versa so you've got to be there when
members of your family even if you know
they haven't scratched your back
recently need help like for example when
a a 12 year old child needs some support
because his dad is going through an
unfortunate illness you know so
unfortunately just the fact that you
don't feel like taking care of your
nephew is not really like a good reason
to be extremely derelict in your duties
to begin with and then on top of that
you don't even have to be like the aunt
of the century in this situation you
just have to be like sorry Mom lunch is
uh I gotta cut lunch a little early
today because I gotta go pick up my
nephew from school instead of letting
him sit there like in tears for two
hours or something or causing my husband
to get a reprimanded at his job like you
really just need to just drive your car
to the school and pick him up and then
you wouldn't have a problem
and you can like be a little upset you
can be like oh I had this I had this
lunch planned with my mom for a while
but you also again this is just my
personal the lens through which I've
consider a lot of things like in my life
sometimes being an adult is being like
hey I'm gonna feel like a bad emotion
from doing this thing but it's the right
thing to do like for example when I
spent uh an hour and a half putting the
baby to sleep last night and then I was
like oh finally I'm gonna like do some
YouTube work and 20 minutes later I
heard her crying I wasn't like oh well I
already spent 90 minutes trying to put
her to sleep like I'm just gonna let her
go
even like I've got a good reason I got
stuff to do hey hey baby I've got my own
work to do maybe you can handle your own
stuff for for now
I just went up and uh you know I I dealt
with it because that's kind of what you
sign up for you know my wife's daughter
is crying again I'll plus to you on that
one
uh excuse me Kate your baby is crying
anyway I'm I gotta make some toast
but you know I understand that's my kid
and this is only her nephew but still
it's just an analogy
you know part of being a mature adult
and especially you know like
as a as a an aunt or an uncle you don't
have the same responsibility that like
the parents have but you do kind of
whether you signed up for it or not
there is kind of like an unspoken like
eye contact that's like if if we [ __ ]
go down on a plane crash you got these
two Rugrats right
if we go down if if we get in like some
horrific accident or something like that
you got us covered and you're like yeah
but please like put your seat belts on
because I don't want to
I'd rather not
anyway
yeah if we get gunned down by Joe chill
after the Opera you got you got this kid
right
anyway it's like you gotta whether you
signed up for it or not that's what it
means to being uh that's what it means
to be like a responsible adult if it's
another adult like I hate to say it if
their nephew was like literally 18 years
old in one day he can take the bus okay
well your nephew's in
Middle School you gotta nut up and be a
sensible adult and be like okay I'm
gonna sacrifice a little bit of my
emotional well-being in order to ensure
that a child has a safe environment like
that's just what it means to be a sane
adult who's not a bad person
disrespect intended anyway
um user received just a staggering
amount of uh
Reddit awards for this post I suggested
he calls some family members to go pick
him up that's exactly what he did his
wife who should be a partner in the
relationship you uh you're displaying
zero empathy to a family suffering
through the effects of cancer this is
true
you better hope you never get cancer
because I'm not sure you'll have a
support system okay you went for the
throat that's one of many reasons I
think that you should hope that you
don't get a bad disease
um it's just I mean you know what go in
I'm not sure that I like this op I'm
gonna give you my license to make uh
glib personal attacks okay just kidding
in Minecraft you're the [ __ ] cold
heartless and Petty also weird that
you're married yeah you choose to call
this child your husband's nephew never
once do you say our nephew
um
there's got to be like a Bugs Bunny joke
here right when my nephew
needs something my husband's nephew
when I need something from my nephew our
nephew you could you could make it work
I can't uh like come up with it on the
Fly I'm not exactly like a meme Wizard
or anything but
um wow this is the most cold-hearted
[ __ ] I've ever read
that's a little much but I can
understand maybe they're not maybe they
haven't read that many great works of
literature or history or whatever but
um
well I mean they're going to be right so
let's pass this one
everybody sucks here your husband should
not have sprung an entire child on you
without consultation listen it's not uh
like he picked up a a a dog from the pet
store right like this isn't like he had
a lifelong dream of always wanting a
nephew
this is uh
it's like a serious
you can't King solemn in this you know
this is like a it came out of nowhere he
he can't yeah he can't say no like what
is his brother that play yourself in the
husband's shoes right the your brother
gets cancer and is like can you take
after my kid and you're like no
I I don't say this very much in react
Court you know usually I I come at this
from the lens of like you and your
spouse are 100 in in 99.99 of situations
you got to be on the same team you know
even within reason you're unified
against the world you're unified against
your HOA together you're unified
sometimes against each other's families
together you you build that that wall
around yourselves you try to you know
live copacetically with everybody but at
the end of the day you're like we we got
each other right this is like the only
situation that we've had so far where
I'm like this is not the case I feel
like if your brother gets cancer and is
like please take care of my child for us
and then your spouse says no then that's
a situation where like you're like well
I gotta like leave you then
this is like one order of magnitude more
important than than the one and
one-on-one relationship with the spouse
so I feel like consultation is good but
she literally if she says no it's an
insane deal breaker
anyway
so I I disagree with this
he should have asked but it's a
temporary Arrangement during an illness
there's an order of magnitude difference
in the assholery here
doing an [ __ ] thing with good
intentions is still doing an [ __ ]
thing and bringing a child into the home
for whatever reason without any notice
to your partner is an [ __ ] move sorry
that
um cancer exists so you talk about
dealing in absolutes
my spouse got into a car accident and
died I needed that car to get to brunch
tomorrow now I've got to take an Uber
well everybody sucks here you suck here
because you don't have any empathy for
um your spouse or the person that your
spouse hit with their car on the other
hand your spouse really left you out to
dry by getting into a lethal car
accident and stranding you without a
vehicle so I would say this is a 50 50
situation I would say everybody sucks
here
if he was going to get into an accident
he should have gotten into an accident
uh on his bicycle or maybe like in a
taxi or something like that he shouldn't
have taken the only vehicle that your
household had available and then had the
audacity to crash it
I am this this every this everybody
sucks here this all caps me me when I'm
agreeing with the worst take I've seen
in weeks this so much this
finally
everybody sucks here op could have more
empathy for the child but it's a dick
move to Spring an entire child on your
spouse without consulting them at all
beforehand and giving them no say and
then berating them and calling them
names when they don't uh show the bare
minimum amount of humanity to a child
that is part of their family literally
all they had to do was pick them up from
school and cut their lunch a little
short uh recognize that they could even
go through like the McDonald's
drive-through on the way home or
something like that
oh I can understand why op is pissed all
right you guys sound perfect for each
other why don't you like uh get married
and live in the same house and then just
look at your phones all the time and
never have a conversation okay anyway
let's let's see what else we got here
am I the [ __ ] for making my younger
sisters fly home early
after they followed my husband
I don't understand the it's kind of like
a a a thumb not a thumbnail a title that
I don't fully understand the
implications of
I have two younger sisters who are 15
and 17. they came to visit my husband
and I on what was supposed to be a
five-week trip okay Congratulations by
the way you're the [ __ ] what's your
job what's your job title a five-week
vacation
people these days lucky enough to get a
damn a three-hour tour a three-hour tour
you're getting a five-week vacation oh
wait they're European okay well thank
you for your service never mind
congratulations next you're going to
tell me you get more than two weeks for
maternity leave too
okay they came to visit my husband and I
on what was supposed to be a five-week
trip unfortunately it had to end early
after they were caught following my
husband after he was having dinner with
a client I told them they had to leave
immediately because I was could tell my
husband was close to exploding
and even though they kept begging me to
hear them out and to let them stay I
wouldn't I called our dad to let I
called our dad
to let him know they would be coming
home early and why which didn't go over
well
my stepmother wanted me my stepmother
wanted me to let them stay until the
morning so they would fly back in the
daytime but I told her it wasn't
possible and they had to leave
immediately
I'm supposed to be visiting soon but my
sisters have told our dad they don't
want to see me and my stepmother and my
and my stepmother said I wasn't well
what are you talking about
I just asked you to proofread it one
time
there's not enough information here I
can't read it it's it does it's like AI
generated man
I'm supposed to be visiting soon but my
sisters have told our dad they don't
want to see me and my stepmother said I
wasn't welcome in her house after what I
did to them maybe it was my own fault
maybe I was having a stroke there I'd
like to apologize am I the [ __ ] for
blaming someone else for me not being
able to read
the reason my husband was so angry is
because the client was the one who
noticed them taking pictures of them and
when he confronted them they were rude
to her and to him am I the [ __ ]
okay so your
sisters are 15 and 17 years old they
thought they were in a cheeky little
like a like an Olsen twins movie
they they were like hey let's they they
thought maybe your husband works for the
CIA or something like that they were
gonna go they they thought that maybe
he's going to meet someone and he's
going to cheat on you but actually if
they spy on him they realize oh my God
he's actually meeting with like a
foreign dignitary and something's go oh
dude like something bad's gonna happen
and then they got to figure out how to
tell the news but no one will believe
them because they're 15 and 17 years old
and then so they they were just having a
little Adventure okay
and that's fine
I don't know is it am I the [ __ ] for
thinking this one's just not that
interesting the the actual meat and
potatoes of this is who cares that a 15
and 17 year old were spying on your
husband eating dinner that and taking
photos is maybe like a step too far is a
little weird at least the actual like
[ __ ] move is that you
not only said you guys have to leave but
you put them on like the first flight
back uh even though it was a red eye
instead of just allowing them to sleep
and then leave in the morning
it's just weird I don't know I don't
know if anybody's the [ __ ] here I
think this is just a strange situation
I don't
I don't know maybe maybe I'm offensive I
don't take it that seriously
also why is your husband meeting a
client on vacation you can't have it
both ways you can't be like you're
you listen I don't know this one I just
don't know if there's enough meat on the
bone honestly
I don't know what's that I don't
understand why you're so mad
only the sisters were on vacation
oh okay so it's like the kids summer
vacation
trip and they I listen I don't know
everybody sucks here just because I
can't read that's my uh
that's my take on it
I forgot how to read as a result I
cannot appropriately interpret this I
declare a react Court mistrial and uh
why don't you rewrite your post and
we'll get another judge on this one and
we'll figure it out okay
how about that because this we I don't
think in good I must recuse myself okay
we're going to send this to a different
Court
am I the [ __ ] for not letting my
daughter buy clothes listen you got to
learn how to write a title that's this
is one of the most insane titles I've
ever heard in my entire life let's see
what's going on here
my wife and I have four kids
14 F and 14m 12 male and 11f okay so
here's the thing
some people out there are just built
different
you had your first kids at age 23 they
were twins
about a year later you said yeah I'll
re-up on that are you crazy
what's wrong with you
you didn't want to just get
a handle
on on things you were like
roughly 12 months after having twins
you're like yeah I could you know what
I'll buy into this I'll re-up no doubt
about it sign me up and then a year at
like listen four and one one set of them
is is twins fair enough but four kids
within three years of each other is
crazy man you can do it like I'm not
saying it should be illegal I'm just
saying like
you know have some self-care like that's
uh
that is crazy
I am saying it should be illegal I mean
this is a lot man
this you're right this is you asked for
a difficulty
isn't that just sips no these sip says
like
Simpsons three kids right his oldest is
like 10 and his youngest is one
that's pretty sensible
I could understand that
four kids within three years of each
other I mean just get ready because like
and again you know you could do whatever
you want with your life maybe some
people want big families it's weird to
me to have four kids within three years
and then not have 20 kids total hello
oh thank you welcome back
oh I have my uh have my fan stuck to it
because it's a magnet I get it you look
nice
hello
the um
I I'm just surprised that having four
kids in three years and then not going
like completely to the John and Kate
Plus Eight level
like you were in such a rush and then
you did it's like uh Tabata
you did like four years on four years
off did you I would have thought listen
I guess maybe you want them all to be
roughly the same age my my parents they
only have one kid that they know of
I was uh I was born when my mom was like
22. I'm sure they were young like they
felt young at the time but now they're
like peers you know now they're in their
mid to late 50s I'm in my mid-30s
early to mid 30s
and it's like we can hang out so I can
understand like trying to like having
your kids at a young age has some
advantages overall
I don't know I'm just surprised also
like you're gonna have two 18 year old
twins a 16 year old boy and a 15 year
old girl in your house
you're asking for like the worst
middle aged of you like your entire life
but I guess like then it's over in four
years or something also yeah all four of
your kids possibly going to be in
college at the same time that's a long
listen I'm I guess I'm saying you're not
the [ __ ] because I think you just
gotta treat yourself anyway
sorry it's unlocked by the first
sentence you still haven't read the post
yeah I haven't even gotten to the first
comment yet
um we generally agree on parenting them
but a recent incident had me and my wife
disagreeing and I want to see if I was
in the wrong a few weeks ago I was at
home with our 12 year old because he was
how do you have time to write this post
shouldn't your ass be like ground down
in the in the bone meal right now how do
you have time to write eight paragraph
am I the [ __ ] threads on red like it
doesn't seem
because it's fake but if it's not but if
it's not
I was at home with our 12 year old
because he was sick with a stomach bug
okay again I'm getting stun locked again
do you have to
I think if your kid is 12
they can stay home from school by
themselves
they don't you don't need to be a home
just because your kid is homeless I mean
when they're like five for sure when
they're 12
come on
you just have them lock the door don't
open it for anybody and then like you
know here's like there's bread and meat
in the fridge you can make yourself a
sandwich
you can't be with four kids I'm sorry
you can't be taking time off from work
every time one of them gets a stomach
bug it's too you you gave up that right
when you had four kids in three years
they're puking all over
they're 12. like I wouldn't let them
drive a car but I trust him to go to the
bathroom and throw up in the toilet
you can get themselves like a glass of
water I'm not I didn't even grow up old
school I grew up like insanely sheltered
I could still uh like if I was home if I
was sick in the like sixth or seventh
grade my parents would just be like okay
don't do anything I wouldn't do
or just play like you know N64 all day
okay there's so many minus twos where do
we go where did we get so soft as a
society
it's driving me crazy
they're 12 man
a hundred years well no no okay a
thousand years ago they could be elected
like the consul of Rome and now we can't
even trust them to throw up in the
toilet
there's nobody else see how messed up
this is
anyway
while I was making him soup he you
telling me this 12 year old kid can't
use a can opener
I'm not asking him to you know
chiffonade his own uh bay leaf and and
make a mirepoix or something like that
like it's just oh sorry sorry sorry
I just think it's so
it's what do you get when you cross a
society that doesn't care about people
with a
I got a call from my twins High School
telling me they wanted to speak with me
and that my daughter had received three
days of in-school suspension for a
bullying incident because of my son's
sickness I spoke through them
via the phone
you spoke through them
like the the way that the Lord speaks
through
a minister
like the way a poltergeist speaks
through your television set
and told them told me everything that
had happened my daughter and a group of
friends were picking on a boy for
wearing a crop top the boy told the
teacher she asked them to stop when they
didn't stop she sent them to the office
after talking to the boy he admitted The
Bullying was going on for a few days and
that they kept bothering him when he
asked them to stop
my daughter and son came home and my
son's face was bright red I told my
daughter to go to a room that sat down
with my son to see if he was okay
apparently I I'm already so confused
apparently the boy
she bullied was a close friend of his
one of his football teammates the boy
was talking to my son and their other
friends and said something about how he
thought it was cool that some men used
to wear sports crop tops the boys told
him if he thought it was cool he should
try it the boys went out and bought some
jerseys from the thrift store and made
them into crop tops just boys being
dudes
just me and my uh my my high school
friends uh going out to the thrift store
buying some sports jerseys turning them
into crop tops wearing them to school
Misha went off uh my uh being the only
10th grader in the whole school who has
hair on his belly button
I then spoke to my daughter she didn't
show much remorse and was dismissive of
me last year she also got in trouble for
bullying someone because of clothing
she's also gotten in trouble for racism
at school what the hell man that's like
all the crop top stuff is pretty bad but
like you were really burying the lead on
this one
when my wife got home we discussed the
punishment and agreed on her not buying
new clothes for a while she has plenty
of new of good clothes already the worst
punishment of all time
you you were racist at school We're not
gonna let you buy new clothes
this weekend we went to visit my brother
my brother lives around three hours away
in a small town we don't see him often
this week was the town's annual Fair
listen
it's called an annual fare okay
only comes once a year can we not just
act like a happy family for the sacred
event that is my brother's Town's annual
affair
if we can't hold it together for the
annual fair I don't think this family's
got a chance man it's a sacred day of
observance at the fair they had booths
from local businesses our oldest son
went to the booth with antique sports
stuff and then the book Booth to get
books on Sports history son loves
reading about those our 12 year old got
some plushies and toys and our youngest
was looking at video games so a word
problem
our oldest daughter went to the close I
stopped her told her the rule was still
in place I said Hey listen don't you
remember how you were so racist I won't
let you buy clothes that being said if
you want books a video game candy or Etc
that's totally fine that's completely
acceptable but clothes are the one thing
you cannot get she was bugging my wife
and my wife eventually told her she
would reconsider it she then talked to
me and I told her that I wasn't changing
my stance because I'm letting her buy
other stuff and I thought she was being
entitled my daughter didn't buy anything
and my wife thinks I was too tough on
her
are you crazy
I love this is framed as if like I'm I'm
kind of a hard ass I don't let anything
go in my house we have standards of
decorum that we have to live with am I
the [ __ ] for being a a Marine Corps
sergeant of a dad I and I guarantee all
the comments are like you're you're too
soft you're not even close to being
Tough Enough
this is is madness
when I called my mom for advice she also
agreed with my wife am I the [ __ ]
um
I mean I think I've said what I need to
say and a 14 year old is racist and a
bully and her only punishment is not
getting close for a while holy cow the
user received a Reddit uh lithium light
bulb for this post
edit day two thank you so much for the
awards I accept it with humility for I
am but a humble sheep
ladies and Gentlemen We Struck gold
everybody sucks here except your other
kids
that we know of
your response to your daughter's
continued Behavior as a bully is that
you can't use italics two times in the
same paragraph because the second
italics undermines the strength that was
implied with the first italics okay
you can't use italics two times in the
same paragraph they have to be used
sparingly
your response to your daughter's
continued Behavior as a bully or is
simply restricted from buying clothes so
candy and toys are okay how is that a
punishment and your wife can't even
manage that no wonder your daughter has
a problem you guys need to implement
consistent and actual consequences for
our actions and teacher why bullying is
unacceptable she's more than old enough
to learn compassion
also living in a predominantly white
neighborhood does not excuse you for
failing a teacher to be aware of other
races and cultures you only have a few
years left with her get on it okay this
is all pretty reasonable
perhaps it's time to delve further into
why your daughter has such an easy time
getting into the white supremacist
rhetoric and why you and your wife have
such a Cavalry response to it start
these conversations at home same
redditor I can't believe it
I'm sure with the thanks for the gold
kind stranger primed me to believe that
we were going to read something insane
but uh
instead there but a but a humble sheep
okay everybody sucks here you're uh bad
at being a dad
other than buying clothes how are you
handling the fact that your child is a
racist bully uh
chose to ignore that one
everybody sucks here okay here we go I
commend you for sticking to your guns
the bare minimum level of commendation
however that is the weakest punishment
I've ever heard of
no he could have had a worse punishment
if his daughter was being racist he
could have said hey no racism for one
week
I think that would have taught her the
wrong lesson
instead he he said no buying new clothes
for an indeterminate length of time
if she's like really into fashion that
that could be very very slightly like
inconvenient
not the [ __ ] wait hold on this is
above red it's a pay grade that's where
you're wrong this is where I get all of
my hot takes on uh parenting
uh foreign policy the economy this is
pretty much a One-Stop shop for things
that are above the internet's pay grade
and I I'm glad it's not changing anytime
soon
well anyway it sounds like uh yeah
everybody sucks here it seems like um
obviously your daughter is by being 14.
is uh not a nice person it seems like
um
you should
um grow a spine how do you like honestly
how do you parent four kids that have
made it from like zero to 14 and like
not have the ability to stick to your
guns even a little bit like that's crazy
I don't think I'm a harsh parent and
honestly at the same time like I haven't
had like any serious issues because my
daughter's like two years old
but even then sometimes like I give my
kid a chocolate egg and then she's like
I want another chocolate egg and I'm
like are you crazy
I'm not going to be the guy who's going
to give you two chocolate eggs
you're I'm not that guy pal I'm not that
guy you get one chocolate egg
I'm not gonna give her two chocolate
eggs it's not good for her
one chocolate egg is in good for her I
compromise by giving her one chocolate
egg
you're the [ __ ] I accept that
I don't want her to be 20 years old and
she has like a rough day at work she
comes home and slams like a six pack of
Kinder Surprises okay
I gotta build that scaffolding for her
to be able to
fill in the rest of her life with with
as many good and healthy habits as
possible as an adult
am I the [ __ ] for telling my friends
my my am I am I the um am I am I the uh
am I the [ __ ] for telling my f26
friend f-26 that hurt am I being
awakened am I a sleeper agent is this
The Manchurian Candidate
am I the [ __ ] for telling my f-26
friend f-26 that her degree is useless
if she has to leave the country to find
work
I have a high school friend Diana who
whom recently got her Master's Degree
she lived in another city and we barely
ever saw each other and she was always
too busy for long phone calls uh so we
only talked briefly now and then 26 year
olds these days are having long phone
calls
this doesn't sound it sounds like fan
fiction written by a gen xer
I'm a millennial we we as our generation
hates the phone
I would have thought maybe like FaceTime
or something like that group chat Diana
doesn't show up in the group chat that
often
people still do long phone calls all the
time
all right I mean I'm asking out of a
sense of genuine ignorance quite frankly
but
so we only talk briefly now and then
during the time she spent on her degrees
I managed to get married and start my
own family it's not that hard like I we
people say congratulations but it is not
like a feat you could literally you
could do it in like a month if you were
crazy you don't like I I don't know if
you want a pat on the back or whatever
but
it's just the way that you phrased it it
you've invited the comparison that it's
like I while she was just farting around
getting her master's degree I was
actually building a life for myself and
that's not a dilemma you want to invite
jury Diana was visiting her family and
we met up for lunch I asked about her
degree work prospects Etc she did her
Masters in Translation or interpreting
or something like that and she said she
got the job but she will have to move to
Brussels I told her that's crazy
if you can't find a job locally as a
foreign language translator then your
degree is a waste of time if you have to
move to another country she said it's an
amazing opportunity that she couldn't
get anywhere around here apparently the
job is related to the EU Parliament or
whatever I admit it I lost her with all
the abbreviations she was using
it's got to be Reddit bait man it's got
to be bait
she again said it's an amazing
opportunity and she's excited I asked
her about the pay and she told me I said
my husband earns that without a degree
so I was right about the Easter of time
and money I'm going to assume that's
waste of time and money but it does tell
me something that your first autocorrect
option is Easter with a capital e
and she's she said it's the starting
salary and it'll grow because the first
year is pretty much training and being
in a junior position I said a junior
position I again said she could have
gotten a similar job here and she
wouldn't have wasted six years Andy
instead could have already worked Andy
start a family family and he's in the in
the chat and here's where she was rude
she said that if she was to be as
unhappy as I was she didn't want a
families she threw in my face that
apparently I'm always complaining about
my husband but I'm criticizing her he's
the best husband in the world I told her
she's ridiculous and mean and she called
me an [ __ ] paid and left the
restaurant I told my friends about this
and they're split in who's the [ __ ]
here so tell me am I the [ __ ] for
telling her the truth is this an insane
post
it's one of the craziest posts I've ever
read
what kind of person thinks that
if you get a degree that forces you to
move for your job
that the degree is a waste
the best degrees force you to move sorry
this may be a little judgmental
[Laughter]
if you grew up in Dayton Ohio and you
get like a computer science degree your
ass is out of there
you're going to you know the you're
going to the Bay Area you're going to
Austin Texas you're going to even you're
going to you're going to Milwaukee or
something like that you're getting out
of there is some of the best degrees are
are vessels to get you out of the place
in which you started you know
I just don't understand the idea like
why would you work that I don't know
where they live to begin with I just
don't understand the the idea that like
oh you worked too hard to leave you
gotta if you're gonna work that hard you
might as well have just stayed
I'm not insulting Dayton okay
I mean it's not even the worst city in
Ohio plus it's where Guided by Voices is
from
it's no Buffalo at least also it is
pretty uh stupid
assuming this post is real and we try to
take it on good faith that it is even
though it's obviously not however
like if anything
if any job was going to force you to
move it would definitely be being as a
translator right like I don't know where
they're from to begin with
but like if you got a degree in a
foreign language and also you speak
fluent English let's say it doesn't
really make sense that you're going to
stay in
ogdenburg you know I don't there's
probably not of a lot of like Flemish
translation work there you gotta go
where the where the
the Sun is up and then make some hay you
know it's just it's crazy
also you haven't even talked to this
person in years and then you're like
basically just insulting them nobody
cares that your husband you know does
well as a drywall hanging LLC okay you
know like the the world needs both kinds
of work why are you being weird about it
lady
my husband's in the NFL
he doesn't have a degree and he makes 11
million dollars a year why do you just
do that I don't know what you do I I
because I my 40 time is not even close
man
it's not even in the ballpark
anyway
I too love concussions
you could just be Patrick Mahomes you
could just never get sacked I don't even
want to read the comments because I know
that the comments are going to be like I
mean what what are the comments going to
tell me that I haven't already learned
myself
hold on I have to close this uh rocket

psionics has released a Halloween event
for Rocket League

album sting take us away

unpopular opinion Sharpshooter is a
blight on the game
what did this the algorithm is all
messed up man
a couple of weeks ago I accidentally
left my car keys in my uniform pants at
work
and left my pants in my locker I don't
wear my uniform home for multiple
reasons I just bring it home to wash I
have two why does that it sounds like
Tim Robinson wrote that line I don't
wear my uniform home from work for
multiple reasons I have two
I realized when I got to the subway
station where I'd parked that I left my
keys back at work a half hour train ride
and no guarantee I'd be able to get back
into the building because it was after
midnight I called my husband to ask him
to bring me the spare key 22 times I
tried my son but he was asleep he's 19
and has a car and didn't wake up when I
called a second time and I tried a
friend I didn't want to call too many
people because again it was after
midnight I kept calling my husband
hoping eventually he'd hear his phone I
wound up taking an Uber home
okay I see
she left her car keys at work this is
what there's too many details she left
her car keys at work
she takes she drives her car to a subway
station takes the subway to work so when
on her way home she realized that she
forgot her car keys when she got to her
car so rather than drive home she needed
to be able to take an Uber okay fair
enough
I needed to get my car because they took
it after 2 A.M usually so when I got
home so when I got home and I was pretty
upset that I'd called 22 times and he
hadn't answered I continued trying to
call him the whole way home in the Uber
when I got home I went inside to the
bedroom and woke him up I was pissed
that this had become a serious emergency
I had this been I'm pissed that it had
this been a serious emergency I wouldn't
have been able to get through to him hey
it's not a serious emergency but if it
had been your behavior would not have
been acceptable
also I know how this sounds but like
this sounds like a great reason to do
the classic
Pat all your pockets to make sure you
got your keys before you leave the
office building like these sound like a
lot of problems that you have with your
husband that would have been prevented
by you not forgetting your car keys now
like stuff happens
people forget you know they make
mistakes they've misplaced their wallet
they misplaced their keys it happens but
at the same time like your husband
didn't do anything he literally was just
at home and then he went to bed he
didn't do anything
my man like he literally just fell
asleep and then woke up to you being
insanely mad at him and having like like
50 missed calls talk about a shot of
adrenaline to like start your day off
wrong
women don't have pockets and L she's got
a bag or something she could look in the
bag for the car keys
even if even if she does have a bag it's
not her like her husband is Levi Strauss
her husband did not invent women's jeans
he's getting all the all the fire and
and he'd create he had none of the
Tinder it doesn't make any sense
it's misplaced anger man tell me she
couldn't add a jacket or something
apparently she made it work every other
day so don't give me the pocket excuse
370 consecutive times remembering her
keys then one time she forgets and she's
like women's genes are the problem just
like take some personal responsibility
he kept saying he had my number in his
favorites so if I called twice the
second time it would go through but he
had his phone on silent and then put it
on top of something soft so he didn't
hear it vibrating he complained I was
mad at him for something I did I replied
that no I was mad at me for forgetting
my keys I'm just taking it out on you
I'm mad at him for not having his phone
on and that he's unreliable in an
emergency which thankfully this wasn't a
huge one so am I the [ __ ] for waking
him up and being pissed I couldn't reach
him in what wasn't a big emergency but
what if it had been yes
you don't sound that like insane but
obviously yes
I mean like
I you here's here's what I think
happened okay and I do this myself and I
think everybody does
you're mad at yourself I'm so stupid
your emotions kick up you're panicking a
little bit as soon as you start
panicking the adrenaline starts pumping
you're not thinking clearly your your
brain is looking for something else to
blame oh why won't iron Galaxy just
release uh more Bots into the hopper so
I could actually win a game oh why won't
they de-rank me so I can actually have
fun playing this game without having to
take any personal responsibility for my
own actions right so like I get it when
you're you're not thinking like being
angry being panicked being scared is
it's like being drunk like your
decisions are not rational anymore
you're flooded with
neurotransmitters that cause you to
behave in irrational ways okay and then
like an hour later you're like I'm sorry
I was being very stupid I was just I was
in an emotional I was in a high end
State okay
that being said
I definitely don't think you can you
don't have a leg to stand on if you're
like hey
you didn't react to my fake emergency
as if it was a real emergency because
that makes you sound that's like a
doubling down it makes you sound like
you're being like even crazier
instead of being like hey
just so you know
never do that again don't put your phone
on silent uh make sure like the Ringer's
on for at least for me and then he would
be like oh yeah sure my mistake instead
you make it sound like you were giving
him a completely invalid Tech test
that was like I'm not having an
emergency but I'm it's like a fire drill
and you failed and that's why I'm mad at
you like that is
you're approaching the situation in in
the wrong way
is is my take on it at the very least
in an actual emergency you would just
call 9-1-1 too
you know what that's the sort of thing
that you and I can look at each other
and make eye contact and Nod
but at the same time you couldn't bring
that up in the argument
is one of those times where like it's
it's such a silver bullet you can't use
it
you have to you have to hold that in
your head as like your your trump card
in the argument but then like you can't
it's too powerful to use it would it
would blow out the other side it
wouldn't be fair
it's true that's that's the way the
camera pans to you and you go
Michael if it's a real emergency just
call 9-1-1
what if 9-1-1
was on silent Jan what if 9-1-1 was on
silent
what if it's busy Jim
you really think I wouldn't push you up
against the wall
anyway like she he can't be and
everybody sucks here he actually like
didn't do anything
like he did nothing this if you look at
this from her perspective you hear like
The Bourne Identity music she's it's
like the tension is amping up if you
look at it from his perspective he's
just like eating dinner watching TV
doing the dishes and then like brushing
his teeth and going to bed and then
waking up in the middle of a a firestorm
dudes actually just going he's like a
cartoon rabbit going like
and then he's waking up to like Jesse
what happened what happened is
everything okay your phone was on silent
I left my keys at work and your phone
was on silent
like he's just uh he's just living his
life man
oh man
you're the [ __ ] he's right you're mad
at him
for something you did him having his
phone in silent was an accident just
like you forgetting your Keys No One
except you did anything to you here yes
true yeah by the way I'm not saying she
can't be like a little
because again when you're emotional
you're like oh I'm mad and like
it's your fault and then like half an
hour later you're like actually I was
just hungry you know like it's you I
understand you got to have an
understanding that flows in two ways
right like I understand that you made a
mistake and yet at the same time like I
also understand why you made the mistake
I could have done something I if my
phone hadn't been on silent I could have
helped out but it's like the response is
disproportionate to the slight in the
first place
say that you say that you've never been
able to reach someone in them in an
emergency without saying you've never
been able to reach someone in an
emergency you will understand why op is
not the [ __ ] if you have never been
through the experience for me it was
having food poisoning while six months
pregnant while my husband was off
gallivanting on a mountain and didn't
leave his route and having to have the
sheriff go look for him in hopes they
might find him fortunately he did and it
was a very awkward 30-minute snowmobile
ride down the mountain for my husband
because the sheriff drove the point home
just how much of an idiot he was by not
telling him
that I was recovering from food
poisoning until they got to the parking
lot and would be okay
he made sure my husband suffered from
the worry women go missing at the park
and ride locations late at night for a
husband to not be reachable to that
extent is beyond ridiculous what
and that's why you never fall asleep or
go on a hike ever I don't even
understand that the user received Reddit
Galaxy for this post I don't understand
the
I don't understand the the the problem
I she had food poisoning while six
months pregnant while the husband was on
a hike and didn't leave his route
or did he leave his route and then the
sheriff had to go look for him
but why
why did the sheriff have to go look for
him
did was the husband the only person he
had the last supply of
antibiotics in his pocket he's the only
person who knows the 12 secret herbs and
spices to make ciprofloxacin I don't
understand why specifically
she goes on in the okay Ben asked why I
was searching for my husband I was in
the ER they contacted the sheriff's
department to look for my husband not
just because I was dealing with food
poisoning but because I also had our two
young kids with me as for limited
resources it was a very large County
with two mountain passes and the largest
city in the state I also knew which pass
he in his mountaineering group was on
since it was June there were limited
ways so much detail
there were limited places that they
could be for practicing snow camping
techniques he forgot to leave his
itinerary when he left early this
morning in the 15 years since he's never
forgotten to leave his itinerary for
either mountaineering or work trips
what the hell are you taught
okay your husband like you're six months
pregnant your husband went for a hike
probably did not 15 years ago
did not what did he that this guy didn't
do anything wrong either
is this exactly the same post as the
original the guy was probably like hey
can I go for a hike today and you were
probably like yeah sure
and then he went on a hike and like some
completely unpredictable [ __ ] happened
and now he's the [ __ ] for some
reason because he didn't leave his
itinerary
he didn't leave a map with his
point-to-point location when he went out
with his mountaineering group 15 years
ago
when you if you ever do your hobby when
I have a problem you're gallivanting if
I ever do my hobby and you have a
problem that's self-care
this is just I I don't understand what's
going on here
you ever wonder why your taxes are so
damn high but it seems like you don't
get anything for them these are the this
insane person is sending the sheriff out
to go to the to to find one single dude
on top of one of two mountain ranges so
that he can provide daycare to two
children like it's not he's not gonna
cure the food poisoning I don't
understand the
I don't understand what the problem is
here
15 000 people read this and said [ __ ]
that dude for hiking it's true I know
I don't I is this like uh I don't know
if the it's like there's a two kinds of
people in the world sort of dilemma here
I think there's some people that are
like unexpected bad [ __ ] happens and you
go like [ __ ] the universe and then
there's some people that go unexpected
bad [ __ ] happened and you're like who
could I plausibly blame if if my husband
was psychic this [ __ ] would not have
happened
so [ __ ] him like this is madness man
I don't understand
he left her with the two kids he no he
didn't okay because that's not like how
reality works
I I'm sure that they in all likelihood
he didn't wake up early and go like I'm
gonna sneak off on a little on a little
hiking trip I'm gonna go I'm gonna go on
a quick 15-hour hike without asking my
wife
he they brought out an arrangement hey
I'll take Saturdays you take Sundays are
you sure you're good are you sure are
you sure okay love you let me know if
you need anything and then he went for a
hike and now despite doing all the
necessary Preparatory work he's getting
raked over the coals for it
and she's she's still holding The Grudge
15 years 15 years down the this [ __ ]
happened in in the Bush Administration
man
second term but still
this [ __ ] is older than the Dark Knight
and we're still hearing about it
it's crazy if they already knew you were
going to be okay why use the resources
of the sheriff to bring him back
the sheriff let the husband sweat it out
for 30 minutes then once the sheriff and
husband got to the parking lot the
sheriff told the husband the wife was
going to be okay let the husband Panic
for a half hour three thousand
sociopaths hey your wife is is really
ill here's the town sheriff on a
snowmobile all the way up the mountain
to come get you it's an emergency is she
going to be okay
why don't you just hop on [ __ ] bag
that you're really happy you went
gallivanting on the mountain today
you just had the gold mountaineering
didn't you
just had to go Mountaineering
well do you you ever know what happens
to kids when they lose their mother
oh yeah she's gonna be fine anyway she's
in room 36B
it's like this if this actually happened
this is crazy
right the sending the sheriff out to
fetch the husband of a woman who isn't
in critical condition sound like a good
use of resources have you ever truly had
food poisoning
it's my time it's my time
at six months pregnant it's a big deal
and op was likely in the hospital the
husband needed to be there in case it
took a turn for the worst to make
medical decisions Okay Internet make up
your mind
is food poisoning not serious at all or
do you need to have 24-hour medical
Supervision in case we need to figure
out if you're going to do a do not
resuscitate order
make up your mind because when I'm like
hey if I didn't get that I had to fight
tooth and nail to get 12 antibiotic
capsules and if I didn't have them I
probably would have been dead by now due
to sepsis or something people are like
yeah sure what I stubbed my toe once I
know what it's like
or is it the sort of thing where it's an
immediate emergency at all times
I get that she's pregnant oh so if I
have been pregnant you guys would have
more sympathy
it's a bit of a double standard don't
you think refusing to elaborate and
moving on
I'm just saying if the rose if the rose
were reversed when did Society Get So
Soft man
anyway I still don't see it regardless I
don't understand like the husband's
fault in this
he just went on a hike
and then the whole town including his
spouse conspired to make him feel like
he was like negligent he didn't do
anything
he unless he gave her the chicken
Sashimi I don't understand the problem
and yeah this isn't even the post I
don't even remember the post now
who's the post oh yeah she forgot her
car keys and it's his fault okay
I don't get that you're the [ __ ] not
the [ __ ] I get what you're saying my
dad went through a very serious
emergency a few years ago and I live out
of state
I
that didn't happen to her
are you stupid
I know you're like well if it did but it
didn't
this is fiction you need a fantasy world
my dad went through a very serious
emergency a few years ago and I live out
of state my mom kept trying to call my
sister who lives 20 minutes from them
but her phone was dead even though she
was at home so she all she was able to
get was the daughter a plane ride away
who could do very little to help until I
flew out where the distance a 9-1-1 not
exist
what's happening
is this a crazy world like is this a
clown world what's happening
I I like okay her phone died like it
happens it doesn't make her a bad person
because her phone died
I don't understand like why they're
raking people over the coals man
both of the sisters are the top heart
surgeons in the world it's the only
thing that that makes sense
or that you need them both like the only
thing that could save him is dropping a
nuclear bomb and they had the only two
keys to turn simultaneously to open the
nuclear football like I I can't even
concoct a a reasonably realistic
scenario in my head where where these
are problems that like genuinely reflect
negatively on the person that is
supposed to have caused them but had
actually nothing to do with it at all
there are settings on phones for this
exact purpose which allow families to
get in touch with you in an emergency
and while yours was not a true emergency
this time dot dot dot I understand why
you're worried about what you would do
if you had a true emergency in the
future okay I thought it was going to be
insane but actually that's fair so what
you should do in the sober light of
mourning is recognized like hey I
shouldn't have been so mad at you last
night about something that literally was
not within your control at all
can you please for the future make sure
that your phone is not on silent when
you go to bed and I'm working
yes honey sorry my bad are you okay can
I drive you to work today blah blah blah
and then you problem solved
I don't understand why we're going
through all these uh
we're going through the Socratic method
here's some [ __ ] that happened to me in
1975 problem that was within my grasp it
just gets blamed on somebody who had the
audience he was out gallivanting at the
grocery store
buying food for our family he had the
audacity to be trying to parallel park
in a spot that was really tight
and also let's be honest waiting for an
Uber alone late at night as a woman is a
little uncomfortable I would have wanted
my partner to at least know what was
going on stay on the phone with me for
while waiting for the Uber sure okay
fair enough
anyways he needs to figure out a better
system especially since it sounds like
you work late nights often you know what
I don't hear what I don't see a single
[ __ ] time in this post you know what
I don't see a single [ __ ] time in
this post at the risk of sounding like a
bad person how about like you triple
check when you leave work to make sure
you got your [ __ ] keys on you I guess
the husband's got to do seven we got to
develop a whole new system to make sure
your husband never has his phone on
silent but at the same time mistakes
happen you leave you know people forget
things all the time so you shouldn't
feel bad about leaving your keys at work
but your husband who didn't have his
phone on uh on three volume and instead
he had it on a soft surface with vibrate
on like
it at least apply it both ways like I I
want to type a post in here and be like
consider hey you ever consider learning
the two tap method where when you're
leaving uh any place or when you're
walking around you just tap one pocket
and you're like wallet and you tap
another pocket and you're like there's
my phone you tap another pocket and
there's your keys I understand women's
pants don't always have big pockets for
all that stuff but you can at least look
in your in your purse or at least
wherever you're keeping your keys you
could have some sort of visual
confirmation or tactile confirmation
that you got the the device that you
need in order to get home and get into
your house
we need to teach people about the Taps
man
the testicle spectacles wallet and watch
they're both [ __ ] but he didn't he
didn't do anything he didn't he didn't
do anything
his phone just happened to be on silent
he was just asleep
by the way have you reversed the roles
of this one the interpretation is
exactly the same
he was the people would I I hope that
they would be like your wife should you
know have your phone uh she should have
her phone with a ringer on just in case
you have a problem but I now I'm
thinking about it a little more and I'm
like no I bet they would be like
literally your wife was just trying to
sleep
man up idiot you really woke up your
sleeping wife
you woke up your sleeping wife because
you forgot your keys you sound like a
selfish [ __ ] I hope she leaves you
and finds somebody that will actually
take her seriously
you better check yourself before she
leaves someone who will show her the
respect she deserves
with his phone on silent it's okay
nobody should be mad but she definitely
should not be mad
if anything he should be mad that she
left her keys okay now maybe it's going
too far if this happened to me I and and
my spouse was mad at me I would be
disproportionately mad at her because I
would be like that's really
irresponsible of you to leave your keys
at your office and put yourself in a
situation that could be dangerous
like I'm not not to potentially victim
blame I'm just saying at the same time
like we gotta both
insulate ourselves from this kind of
like nightmare in the future
that's why do you see the kind of
problems that a three tap solves
if you've got if you've got one
important possession in each pocket and
you just go tap tap tap you're good to
go I think my my sentence here is just
could she just buy
a really small pair of men's jeans to
wear to work so they've got big pockets
and then one pocket is your phone one
pocket has your keys in one pocket has
your wallet
and I also want to say and I'm sure that
men do this too but I I so often see it
from women we got to stop this iPhone in
the back pocket thing you're asking for
trouble I'm not even talking about
pickpockets although it's a juicy Target
with 75 percent of your iPhone sticking
out of your back pocket but one day
you're gonna sit down you're gonna sit
down on your iPhone you're gonna crack
the screen okay
and maybe we need to completely
revolutionize women's fashion to get
deeper front pockets or something like
that but
we come on it's just you're you're
asking for you're setting yourself up
for failure
when you got a smartphone in your back
pocket
that's where your wallet goes and it
just causes like a gradually like a
asymmetry in your spine that leads to
lifelong back pain okay
is not where you put your your iPhone
though
anyway
I
she
I just I'm why does everybody have a
story of somebody else being the [ __ ]
for not being a slave to their cell
phone like it's driving me crazy you're
the [ __ ] okay yeah I agree with you
but let's pass
not the [ __ ] this is a weird one I
didn't realize so many people would be
okay with their spouse being Out Of
Reach unless it was something you both
knew about ahead of time
unless you both knew that an unexpected
emergency was definitely not going to
happen
are you listening to yourself
unless you both agreed in advance to not
have anything
urgent pop up
redditors be like imagine sleeping not
me
the reason am I the [ __ ] about the
dude whose fiance was M.I.A for nine
hours he was quite right to flip because
he couldn't get in touch but this person
shouldn't be mad because I don't know
I'm sorry I haven't done the required
reading on that one so I I can't uh
agree or disagree if I were stranded
somewhere and tried to call my partner
and they ignored me I'd be upset too I'd
also point out to them that if I had
been calling for an emergency say I was
hospitalized and trying to get a hold of
them they would have missed my calling
that going forward they need to be
responsible that's an expectation for me
not you if your spouse didn't know you
expected support okay well um that's
fine that's fine hey just so you know
you wouldn't have had to give me 50
missed calls if you didn't forget your
keys at work as long as we're playing
that nobody's ever allowed to make a
mistake game uh whose mistake caused
this whole situation in the first place
just so you know you wouldn't have had
to call me 50 times if you just did the
three type and made sure you didn't
leave your keys at work NL people forget
things all the time it's a hap it's a
human's mistake and then people forget
to leave their ringer on all the time
why is it that there's a double standard
on the ringer but leaving your keys at
home and also it's like how is she able
to get into her house without having
their keys to begin with it's like
that's also a bigger problem that she
could have been stranded outside of her
house that's why you gotta check the
keys man
redditors be like
if I had a spouse and this was an
emergency this would be a deal breaker
for me
no [ __ ] here people here responding
telling op to call 9-1-1 if it was an
emergency don't get the point because
that completely blows out her argument
and undermines her position the point is
op's partner was unable to be contacted
if there had been an emergency just
restating The Point again
you're missing the point the point is
that if you believe what she's saying
and agree with it then she's right
he still wouldn't have answered that is
what op means when they worry about him
not responding during an emergency op
was not saying their partner should act
as Emergency Services No but like
what they're saying you're missing the
point they're not saying that like your
husband would be the cops and the
paramedics in the fire department
they're saying at least you wouldn't
like [ __ ] die
you would you would be able to get some
help and then when your husband woke up
he would be like holy [ __ ] 60 missed
calls let's like get ahead of this
problem now even though I've got you've
got a head start on me
is about like
that like I understand that you're like
I would like to be able to reach my
spouse at all times but at the same time
like this is about your personal safety
if it was an actual emergency
police should have driven a snowmobile
to his house
let him stew for a little bit hey
hmm
not so good on the cell phone there are
you Andy well remember how you used to
have a wife
you better hop on the snowmobile just
kind of putter around for 30 minutes and
be like oh no she's actually she came
home while we were on the ride she just
forgot her car keys and was mad at you
I don't understand the the the fiction
here
on the other side her husband didn't do
it intentionally there wasn't malice
here
not from not from his side
not from his side
is crazy man
you're the [ __ ] you took one moment
where everything was stacked against
your husband that he didn't hear his
phone go off ignored his reasonable
explanation and jumped to you're
unreliable in an emergency that's not a
reasonable way to talk through a
conflict so true so true after 12 a.m he
wasn't available mind you such a
reasonable time of day to not be
reachable LOL
um no if your wife regularly commutes
home after midnight you should
absolutely absolutely be available in
case of emergency hell if you have any
family at all you should absolutely
always be available okay
he probably agrees but he had his he he
happened to put his phone on a soft
surface once again
it's completely reasonable to leave uh
the thing that allows you to get into
your car in your house in your locker at
work it's completely unreasonable to uh
have your phone on silent and then fall
asleep
I am I am a human being by the way
you're the [ __ ] this was I I can't do
I honestly I have to have to move on
from this one otherwise we're never
going to get to another post this is
insane to me
again he should be reachable
but at the same time like
he you made a mistake that revealed his
mistake that is not even on the same
magnitude as your mistake
it's like if you skipped lunch
and didn't tell your husband you skipped
lunch then he came home from work and
you expected him to have brought home
takeout without asking him
and then you're blaming him for the fact
that you're hungry you didn't need lunch
and he didn't text me saying get some to
get some uh you know quesadillas on your
way home
you gotta you gotta eat a snack
super people Early Access now live on
Steam how about that
okay hold on
am I the [ __ ] for putting my husband



fancy knives through the dishwasher
am I the [ __ ] for putting my
husband's Le Creuset cast iron saute pan
in the washing machine
so i28f have on occasion put my
husband's dirty knives through the
dishwasher despite him asking me not to
these knives are extra sharp for cooking
and apparently the dishwasher will blunt
them I am terrified it's always I'm
sorry it's not funny but it is funny
it's always like I did something
unacceptable and the reason is I have a
genuine like medical psychological issue
I have I have a diagnosable phobia of
Dijon mustard if I even see a butter
knife with a the residue of Dijon on it
I enter into involuntary shock
I don't know she might it might be
genuine trauma okay
I'm not trying to make fun of it I'm
just trying to get you to laugh at what
I said without considering the
ethical and moral considerations of
making fun of a stranger online is that
so much to ask
so i-28f these knives are extra shot for
cooking apparently the dishwasher will
blunt them I am terrified of knives to
the point where if I see them on the
work surfaces I will begin to panic my
husband is aware of this and I never use
these particular knives as I know as I
know I'm not allowed to dishwasher them
if you like and this is just an info
question it's not an accusation
you're terrified of knives but you can
use knives you just can't use those
knives
you're terrified specifically of those
knives
some other knives are at least
maybe scary but like you can still deal
with it
I'm just asking
I can't face cleaning a Knife by hand if
I have to use one I will use one of my
old knives that I put through the
dishwasher now
by the way that makes it very hard to
cook I'm sorry that I'm sorry to tell
this to you but if you have the
inability to use a knife you might want
to just maybe work on like some kind of
chore wheel or something like that where
your husband does all the cooking
because it's going to be almost it's a
foundational skill you can make a
quesadilla like no because you got to
cut the quesadilla afterwards I don't
know what you're going to cook honestly
maybe you could just do scissors I guess
but what is a scissor except for two
knives uh persevering
now my husband will use his fancy knives
and leave them dirty either in the sink
or on the worktop they can be there for
days okay it's a little there's a little
everybody sucks here
just the thought of them being out
terrifies me I can't face cleaning them
by hand so I will put them in the
dishwasher to get them out of my sight
he is free at any point prior to the
wash cycle to remove and clean them by
hand
I think that's a little ridiculous you
ever hear of out of sight out of mind
if I didn't see the knife in the sink I
would not assume that it's like oh I
gotta get it out of the dishwasher
is that where you store dirty dishes to
then be removed and cleaned in the sink
I don't think so that's that strikes me
as invalid
he thinks I'm the [ __ ] for putting
them in despite him asking me not to I
think he's the [ __ ] for leaving out
dirty knives despite him being aware of
my fear two things can be true at the
same time we're actually a really good
team and barely disagree on anything but
this seems to be an obstacle we cannot
agree on
I need internet strangers to tell me
who's in the wrong if anyone please and
thank you yes I am getting therapy I get
that my behavior and fear are abnormal I
also have OCD and general anxiety that
will be negatively contributing also my
husband isn't a dirty Gremlin or
anything he's genuinely so supporting
loving so supportive loving and great
around the house it's just some sort of
weird blind spot we both have he does
all the cooking now that we have a baby
so In fairness I feel that I should do
the cleaning up okay this is not a real
problem
you should he should clean the knives
like you're the [ __ ] for putting them
in the dishwasher
not to be like if if there's dishwasher
if if the knives cannot go into the
dishwasher without being ruined you
should not put them in the dishwasher
you should put them like anywhere else
even like in the I I don't even know
like in the garbage can
put them dirty back in the drawer or
something like that like I understand
the problem but uh
but the dishwasher is like the one place
they shouldn't go
I don't say this lightly can't you just
yell at him
can't you just be like hey you know I
have a phobia can you just clean your
knives real quick
why do you have to put them in the
dishwasher like what's the what's the
issue there
can't you just be like hey it's like I
just this is like the one thing I'm kind
of irrational about can you clean your
knives it's like I think that he's kind
of the [ __ ] for not for knowing this
about her and then not making an effort
to clean them especially if they're like
there for days I do think she's the
[ __ ] for putting them like in the one
place that they probably shouldn't go so
this is like a weird everybody sucks
here but I do also acknowledge that
everybody has like uh
everybody has stuff like this you know
weird little uh quibbles over stuff that
doesn't actually matter and then for an
outside Observer it's so easy you're
like why don't you just like say how you
feel and you're like you don't get it
you don't understand that's too easy
so this is not even like that big of a
problem I can't believe this has ten
thousand upvotes this is these people
are going to be fine in my opinion
I think they're going to be okay
am I the [ __ ] for not going out to
get a special Pizza
I don't even understand is this like uh
how special is the pizza is this a drug
thing
my brother brings over his girlfriend to
a pizza in movie night
I get the 10 Costco pizza for everybody
the only toppings they have is pepperoni
or cheese I get one of each we also have
some wine in a can
foreign
I respect that I I'm not making fun of
them I'm laughing at the fact that they
could have ridden Just Wine but they
said no I'm gonna divulge
that it is in a can it is canned wine
they could have made it seem a little
bit classier but they they said I'm not
gonna put on airs it's in a can it's not
in a Tetra pack it's in a can
Coke and bottled water other than that
it's a BYOB or wine the girlfriend gets
there and acts like the pizza is
disgusting and asks if we can order
anything else I said no she asked my
brother to get a pizza she likes a
medium cost 24 dollars who doesn't like
Costco pizza
I'm a bit of a snob and Costco pizza is
delicious
it might not be the best pizza in the
world but it's like it's fine
it's not horrible I've eaten worse
pizzas for sure I mean anybody here from
BC anybody here ever eaten at Fresh
Slice
it's like the pizza is like sous vide
it's made of old leftover Lunchables
I used to eat there a lot because on
Tuesdays a slice was like a dollar 25
but
bro I love fresh slice
we have it in Toronto also Fresh Slice
is like the craziest franchise to me I
can't believe that it ever expanded past
one location
it actually makes no sense that that
there was a situation where like
somebody ate at a fresh slice and was
like I want to open one of these it
doesn't make sense to me
the crust is like um it's not crispy
it's not firm the crust is like
untoasted bread
anyway sorry I'm I got stun locked again
I told my brother
if he goes to take her with you and you
are not coming back with the I told my
brother if he goes to take her if he
goes take her with you and you're not
coming back with a special Pizza just
for her she makes him leave before 10
minutes into the movie because she was
offended that we didn't go out of our
way to make her welcome am I the [ __ ]
for alienating my brother and his
girlfriend over over Pizza preferences
come on
like that's too far
my brother has been calling me all sorts
of names and calling me cheap I don't
think it was my responsibility to cater
to one person at the party and it's rude
to just get a pizza for yourself he
called me trashy and said and I said the
only trash you wanted to party was his
girlfriend and don't bring her around
again until she learns some manners well
like this is
she is the [ __ ] for not just
well because it's so weird to me to be
like yeah I like pizza but I'm not
eating Costco pizza you have to order a
different pizza for me like that's crazy
pizza's Pizza there's you could not
bring a pizza design to be eaten to a
party and have me refuse
it's not like it wouldn't happen maybe
it's not my preferred toppings that's
okay I'll still eat like one to four
slices
but then also like what's the problem if
she wants to get her own pizza and eat
it at your house who cares
if if she paid for it and and she and
her boyfriend got it and brought it back
are you worried that it's gonna like
is gonna emasculate your Costco pizza
like I don't understand the problem
even 7-Eleven Pizza okay maybe not
7-Eleven Pizza
I have to think about it
I I don't that might be the only Pizza
worse than Fresh Slice but
I just I it has to be in everybody's
sucks here also why are people getting
into these arguments over something so
small you imagine like ripping your
family apart over Pizza
it isn't even like somebody wants uh
pizza and somebody wants hamburgers is
somebody wants pizza and somebody wants
a different pizza and they can't find a
middle ground
they just go like uh like Armageddon
as soon as there's even the slightest
bit of disagreement like it's crazy
you're both the [ __ ] and they see I
don't even want to read the comments
what's the point of reading the comments
you're both insane you're having an
argument over Pizza like you're in the
the sixth grade or something like that
am I the [ __ ] for sometimes hanging
out in states of undress with my
boyfriend's roommate
come on come on
with your boyfriend's roommate
I'm pretty much a practical nudist you
know what that seems like a pretty
impractical thing to be
in the adult world
like on the weekends sure but like uh
the rest of the time I think you've
gotta I would say you're an impractical
nudist if it leads to situations like
this a practical nudist maybe at home
alone with other nudists at a beach that
uh you know is uh facilitating that kind
of stuff you are an impractical nudist
you're doing it in situations that
people have problems with it's clearly
having an effect on your life because
you had to make a post about it online
meaning that I love to wear as few
clothes as practical
naturally in Social settings I try to be
more careful that must be hard
my boyfriend and his roommate have a
pretty sweet apartment downtown so we
spend most of the time there he's a
really nice and chill guy and on days my
BF and I don't want to get intimate we
just hang out in the living room
drinking smoking and watching movies
so these they're clearly in their 30s
sometimes I end up just hanging out in
the towel after a shower I explicitly
checked with the roommate that this was
okay and he didn't mind unfortunately
now he has a new jealous girlfriend who
doesn't hang out with us sometimes but
she still feels like she needs to police
what I'm wearing in the apartment of my
boyfriend we got into a bit of a stupid
text message exchange when she found out
and she's clearly jealous and insecure
it doesn't help her self-esteem I guess
that nine out of ten times nine times
out of ten people at nine times out of
10 people are gonna say I'm the hotter
person beauty is in the eye of the
beholder and all that
I'm not self-centered it's purely a
comfort thing it's not remotely sexual
for me so I think I'm in the right
holding my stance here am I the [ __ ]
edit I would cover up if she was around
for sure I don't intend to make anyone
uncomfortable that was said in the
beginning well but you are making her
uncomfortable
intentionally
and then you're suggesting it's because
you're more attractive than she is
you're really just the editor is just a
lie
I get that like you wish it was true
but at the same time
I don't understand
um
I don't yes you're the [ __ ]
again I kind of feel like we don't need
to read the comments on this because
it's like cut and dry
I hate to say this okay I'm not a nudist
I'm if anything I'm a I'm a never nude
at the same time though if you're a
nudist don't you sort of have to it's
like smoking right it's one of those
things where if one person in a room is
like
please don't then you have to respect
that and go outside
it's not like a it's not a democracy
thing where it's like oh seven people
said it's fine if I'm naked three people
have a problem so I'm just gonna send it
I think it's one of those ones that like
if even a single person has a problem
with it you've gotta you've gotta say
okay fine I'll wear clothes
I'm not judging your lifestyle by the
way I'm just and and honestly I I
genuinely don't care
if if I was in a room and someone was
like hey would you mind if I take off
all my clothes I would be like you gotta
you gotta do right by you brother sister
whatever
doesn't matter to me I'm going to be
looking at my phone 90 of the time
anyway
but I do think it's one of those things
where like if if even if one person has
a problem with it then you're like
okay I gotta I'm just gonna wear like
not not to be judgmental I'm just gonna
dress like a normal person
I'm just gonna put on clothes like uh
like everybody else on planet Earth
you know
I don't understand I don't understand
you're the [ __ ] it's a shared
apartment if your boyfriend's roommate
is paying rent and he says that you
shouldn't be practically nude in shared
spaces you should respect his wishes as
a paying member of the household true
his house his rules I will go further to
say I've yet to meet a young woman who
considers herself hotter who wears
little clothes around other men who does
not secretly thrive on the attention I
know this is something I'm going to get
downvoted into Oblivion for 39
400 of votes use it user received three
Reddit Golds a Reddit shooting star a
Reddit lithium light bulb and a Reddit
so true clapping award for this post
and I was pretty oblivious to it until
my fiance pointed it out but ever since
having it pointed out I'm hyper aware of
it I'm hyper I'm hyper aware of it
scientists uh adult on planet Earth ever
since my fiance pointed it out I am
hypersensitive to uh hot women craving
attention
even if it's subconscious you're likely
doing the same all right
user received every award Under the Sun
for this you're the [ __ ] yes okay
true
you're the [ __ ]
yes
come on why bother posting in this sub
if you've already made up the mind that
you're not the [ __ ] okay very true
you know what I'm hot I'm also
chronically hot all the time and have
been my whole life I too love to be
comfortable if it was just a comfort
thing I would be most comfortable going
everywhere in a tank top and some
panties you know why I don't because
it's so damn weird
for me to prance around in front of
other people like this Oh you mean not
in public godded
when I go over to other people's houses
I don't strip down to just the tank top
and panties I'm also not about to ask
the other people I'm visiting hey mind
if I take off my clothes and lounge
around in your furniture like a cat I
promise I'm not vain it's just the
comfort thing I hope your boyfriend's
roomie gets a girlfriend that's hotter
than you and she likes to walk around
naked I'm far from a prude if I if you
were at a nude beach go for it but you
seem to be really into the idea that
you're so much hotter than this dude's
girlfriend and she's obviously super
jealous of you meanwhile she likes to
think that you're a strange little
creature with no social skills who likes
to parade about in a small cloth much
like Gollum you're the [ __ ]
I love when people use you're the
[ __ ] like uh like an easy clap emoji
much like Gollum so true
anyway the person they're 100 right in
their comment in my opinion but but
still
it is it's the QED the QED of Reddit
again I'm not anti-nudist
but this is why like if you're a nudist
you have to if that's the foundational
element of your personality
nobody's like running solo as a nudist
right you're all they're living in
nudist colonies that's why they call
them that
you have to find other people who are
like okay I'm all right with
you being new to 100 of the time and
then you go you know just live your life
together in nakedly which is completely
fine by the way
Ricky

I would say it's not even close Steely

loaded God complex [ __ ] it and pull it
what was that squirt noise oh are you
jealous Daniel this is my um Peloton
branded water bottle it has a digitally
embossed signature of every single

favorite instructor
it's hard to tell I don't read cursive
writing that well
um
I'm really I'm looking
I'm looking
I I don't know if you can see this one's
that's Sam yo right there that's Sam yo
you can tell because it says s-a-m-e-o
um
but I gotta be honest I'm I'm having a
hard time well you know what here's Ben
Aldis I don't know if you've taken any
any EDM rides there's been all this
right there
um I I'm having a hard time finding Ali
love and I apologize for that oh
no I don't think that I don't know
I I you know what I'm gonna have to get
back to you on that one
Ali love is goaded hey Ali love uh she's
got the 30-minute Alanis Morissette ride
that's only from only songs from Jagged
Little Pill I would definitely uh I
would recommend that one if you've never
taken it
or if you've never taken it twice if it
would the climb to you live you learn
gets me every time it's Chicken Soup for
the millennial the bald Millennial soul
am I the [ __ ] for telling my friend's
girlfriend I thought she was a little
fat
uh you you're starting in a hole I gotta
see if you can dig yourself out of this
one
he said a little
bit my best friend Nick his girlfriend
Martha and I were hanging out in his
basement after smoking a bowl together
she asked him I'm prompted babe do you
think I'm fat Nick being the dutiful
boyfriend responded of course not of
course not babe
she then turned to me and said op do you
think I'm fat
I I turned to Derpina
and I looked at her in the windows of
her soul and I said
now here's the thing I strive to be a
very candid person I will not hesitate
to speak my truth because I believe it's
most uh the the 21 year oldest redditor
has just logged on
lying is immoral Ergo it's always moral
to tell the truth okay I live my life
according to a series of principles I
live a principled life Susie
I will not hesitate to speak my truth
because I believe it is always better to
be frank with people than to tiptoe
around what you actually feel
in my experience avoiding the truth
often leads to confusion and or pain
wait till you see the damage that
telling the truth can do
of course I don't want to be an [ __ ]
so if I'm going to say something I think
could be taken poorly I try to be as
nice as possible while also remaining
candid back in back to the basement I
don't find MARTA very fat I wouldn't
call her obese or anything but a little
chubby yeah I knew if I told her this
directly she'd probably get upset so I
asked her in response do you want my
honest opinion
she said she did so I gave it my exact
words were I'd like to preface this by
saying that this in no way affects how I
view you as a person I don't think that
weight is a good measure of who someone
is that being said a little bit yes
oh no
[Laughter]
no
no that's so much worse
when you ask do you think I'm fat and
they replied just so you know uh what
I'm about to say doesn't mean I think
any less of you as a person
you could have just said yes
that wouldn't have been as bad as as
prefacing it with this bizarre
disclaimer
that's Madness man
you want to talk about radical honesty
my God
my God Niles
hey what's the name of that ice cream
but it's like Neapolitan but it has a
pistachio in it what's it called again
just someone's gonna know this it's the
ice cream they serve at the Old
Spaghetti Factory
spamoni
my God Niles you're nuttier than the
green part of this bomoni ice cream my
Frasier you're as nutty as the green
part of spamoni ice cream
don't worry about her for Asia this is
Daphne don't worry about her Frasier
she's not even that green powder spumoni
ice cream
so I'm trying to I can get it to work
this is how Fringe this is Raz
come on Frasier she's nuttier than the
green part of spamoni ice cream
um sorry she got really quiet and it was
kind of awkward I was about to leave
anyway so I went home soon after
later Nick texted me and says I really
upset martai or an apology for what I
said I don't think I did anything wrong
the way I see it she asked for my honest
opinion and I gave her just because she
didn't like what my opinion was doesn't
mean I was wrong to give it fishing for
compliments doesn't always go the way
you want it to
why couldn't you just
like why couldn't you just lie
I don't understand
like are you stupid
like literally just tell a a fib what's
the issue
lying is immoral yeah but sometimes it
could save you from a situation like
this
obviously by the way it does bother him
like this is the is the foundation of of
being a young man at least in my
experience having gone through it myself
you're like
I'm a pillar of individualism I live
according to a set of principles that I
design and then immediately after doing
it you feel bad and you run to the
internet for validation and you're just
like hey anyone else in as insane as me
can anyone else validate my insane
Behavior
and yet still let me feel as if I'm a
paragon of individualistic virtue like
it's just
just lie man
I don't understand
you still do it today I know
plus do me
I've gone to other impartial friends to
get their opinions and they've been
pretty split so I'm asking Reddit am I
the [ __ ] yes obviously
with like I just don't understand like
why were you trying to like what are you
trying to do I guess
if you think that she's a little bit out
of shape she probably thinks she's
extremely out of shape
she just you're not the first person to
plant the idea in her head that maybe
she's not you know in the kind of
condition that she wants to be in okay
so then you did you didn't just answer
her honestly as if like oh nobody else
sees I have unique access to information
that nobody else is aware of you went
over the top and said just so you know
yeah I think you're fat but I don't
think that makes you like a bad person
or anything nobody's she didn't ask do
you think I'm a bad person
she just asked do you think I'm a little
bit fat and you like when you wrote like
an end user license agreement about
Insanity I just don't understand why you
would preface it with that and if it
makes the the honesty ten times worse
it's like when you need the you know you
need to feed like a cat a pill so you
wrap it in like Mead or or like coated
in butter or something like that and
then by the time the Cat knows that it's
actually a pill it's already swallowed
it you did that but you put it like in
in
hot sauce or like you know super glue or
something like that like you took
something bad an uncomfortable truth and
then you rolled it in something even
worse and then said take some of this
tubby
it's the the worst way possible to give
someone criticism
yeah you just gotta filibuster true
you gotta you gotta talk around the
question
there's worse ways to answer this maybe
like if she said do you think I'm fat
you could have said something like ah
who cares about my opinion anyway
you could have said eh not really like
these are all bad answers but like
I don't understand like just nut up and
lie a little bit it's not it keeps the
world Running Man
tell me telling the truth in every
situation is something you can only get
away with when you have no
responsibilities I'm sorry to say
as soon as you got [ __ ] to do
you're gonna lie just as just to
lubricate the gears of Industry sorry
I'm late there was traffic okay maybe
there was traffic but maybe you could
also left like 10 minutes early
oh sorry I didn't see this until just
now now you saw it and then you said I'm
gonna reply and then you procrastinated
on it and then you forgot about it and
then you replied two days later like
it's just it happens all the time
McDonald's Sprite exactly
sorry they're out of Sprite
out of Sprite
congratulations
oh man they're going off congratulations
you're attempting to use a radical
honesty ideology to pretend you don't
understand subtext or social norms this
is a newer groundbreaking or insightful
it's just you pretending you don't know
what it is to be rude
if you want to call Marta out for
seeking reassurance or answer she
doesn't actually want to hear then
figure out a way to do that honestly and
kindly but don't act like you didn't
perfectly know what you were doing
that didn't perfectly know that you were
pulling her up for compliment fishing
and develop a lies or pain thing to
justify it everybody sucks here what did
she do
she didn't well I mean I don't know I
mean I guess in principle you shouldn't
ask questions that you don't want honest
answers to
you know what she should have said is
tell me I'm pretty
then we'd be having a whole different
discussion here
she shouldn't have said do you think I'm
fat
you should have said
I'm not gonna go there
you're the [ __ ] I strive to be a very
candid person I will not hesitate to
speak my truth re-examine that
philosophy it's not the virtue you think
yes okay I would agree with that
everybody sucks here because tact is a
third option besides lying and telling
radical truth but also don't ask if you
don't want to hear the answer also edit
thanks for all the updates and my Awards
ask me no questions I'll tell you no
lies I love this one bad bad it's so
true
I'm going to put myself in the firing
line here and say as a person who's
chubby my BMI says I'm obese because I'm
4 10 and nine and a half Stone
a stone is 16 pounds is this correct in
16 pounds is around
7.5 kilograms 7.5 times
9.5 times
16.5 divided by 2.5 she's 30 pounds
look I don't need to know the numbers
here that me fishing for the numbers is
actually more problematic than the
original post
like I'm gonna without even seeing this
person I'm gonna be like let me see if
you're let me see if you're big enough
for me to take your post seriously
listen let's just take them at face
value here okay
and if I ask you a question I want an
answer I don't really understand the
whole thing of fishing for weird
compliments with lies type of thing it's
a whole Minefield if I ask my friends if
I'm fat and they tell me I'm goddamn
well fed and to get my ass on a bloody
bike
I don't think it's really fair for you
to say you're the [ __ ] when you don't
know whether the person is like me and
would deride you horribly for lying we'd
take the piss for weeks in my friend
group most British redditor found of all
time
or the girls social Minefield or
prancing around the [ __ ] lavender
field hoping to not step on a mine I'm
not like other girls okay I'm a cool
girl I'm mostly I honestly I'm just like
one of the guys
a lot of the other guys they the other
guys
they can't really talk about this kind
of stuff with their girlfriends you know
they have to always have like good
manners and stuff like that I'll put up
with crass humor and being verbally
abused a little bit I'm not like the
other girls you want to invite someone
out to uh to Pub night watch a little
bit of the footy and complain about your
partners I'm the girl you want to call
I'm not like other girls
Jesus Jesus tapped dancing Christ it was
early and I was high when I wrote this
comment cheers for the awards Lads holy
cow
that's kind of an incredible post
I said
not the [ __ ] you asked and she said
yes people need to really stop asking
questions they don't want the answer to
now she's hurt her own feelings
people will really be like
um
I never tell a lie until they get asked
like why didn't you do something you
were supposed to do and then what they
what they should say if they're into
radical honesty is I didn't really make
it a priority I didn't really want to do
it instead they start spinning excuses
oh well yesterday I did this instead and
uh uh I didn't honestly I don't even
think that we should have to do the
dishes I think we should just start
eating off of disposable plates and
Cutlery all the time I'm radical honesty
by the way
radical honesty for you
Sweet Little Lies to protect the ego of
Mommy's special little boy for me and
that's actually the standards by which I
want to live by
so I I'm not judging too much lest I be
judged but at the same time
like I acknowledge the double standard I
try to sometimes I I wither chat with
something someone said if you take a
poop and your toilet can't flush it is
that the toilet's fault and I said is it
your is it society's fault that you're
unhappy that was a disproportionate
response compared to the thing that led
to the response in the first place
I acknowledge my own my own bias in
hypocrisy
in the uh
in this argument
but I always wrap all these in an
envelope of uh I'm also insane
everybody's a little bit insane I might
just be better than average at
acknowledging my own insanity
whereas other people for some reason
like to believe that we're all in the
quest to live a perfectly rational life
that is uh it's a Fool's errand that
could never come to pass
stop doing that with your hands the Jedi

so sometimes you're gonna do [ __ ] I I
did something selfless for another
person even though I didn't get that
much enjoyment out of it just go to the
concert and like
you know it's 90 minutes of listening to
music you'll survive
she was elated when I told her I bought
the VIP package meet and greet pictures
with the band etc etc last week my
girlfriend began asking if we had to get
to The Venue early being the thorough
honest detailed person that she is I
assured her I would check instead I was
too busy with work honestly it was
getting a bit annoying that every few
days she would ask so I told her I
didn't see anything while deleting a
bunch of emails from the venue for
concerts I don't even care about on
Friday afternoon she told me she looked
she tried looking things up and was only
finding the doors opened at seven with
that I picked her up at six and arrived
at the venue for seven world's stupidest
man on planet Earth
who deletes their emails in 2022. don't
put Dan on blast like this okay
Dan is a noted email deleter but I don't
think he would make this post
because it's self-reporting I don't
think he would do it in the first place
but he definitely wouldn't make the post
he's smarter than that
once inside she showed security our
tickets and asked about the meet and
greet the bouncer informed us the VIP
was at six I froze now my girlfriend
turns to me asking if I received any
kind of emails because the tickets were
in my name
I told her I deleted the emails and she
seemed to understand I actually really
enjoyed the whole time so once her band
set ended we decided to not stay for the
last band and this is where the trouble
began
everything was completely fine
until she suggested we leave early and
then started laying into me for some
reason
it's 10 p.m we're outside of the venue
she suggests we go to a bar a block away
and either walk or ride share
immediately I said not a chance
immediately yes
she suggested we continue having a good
time by having a drink or two I said no
shot says you
she mentioned that my car was in a
secured lot and we wouldn't be far but I
lost my cool
which I admit was not the best way to go
about things and told her you don't go
out in the city there is crime all over
the place she responded that we were in
the city I went off about how I can't
stand it here so she said that we'll
just leave no raising of her voice she
just said she was fine with leaving she
was silent on the way back and I suggest
that we go back to my place to finish
out the night
and she refused this also pissed me off
because I asked what was wrong with the
bar next to my apartment and she shut
that down with her short responses
overall the night costume saying is uh
saying his boyfriend overall the night
cost me 300 and while she's saying more
to me now as opposed to Friday night
she's still being very distant she told
me she could live with not going to the
meet and greet except for how things
turned out afterwards and that is when
the disappointment truly set in my
response was that I was only bringing
her to the concert nowhere else and
thinking of her safety she continued
that I shouldn't have bought the tickets
if I was only tolerating doing so uh
info where what city do you live in
is it under siege by zombies right now
Gotham okay and Gotham then maybe he has
a point of going back to the suburbs
or if the concert was in
Gastown in Vancouver
and she was like hey take me to the this
place looks nice it's called the Cobalt
Hotel then no no no then you hey we got
to get back to Port Coquitlam okay
there's an Earls uh two blocks away from
my apartment we'll go to we'll go to
Earl's
we can get a 17 Moscow Mule there okay
my response was that I was bringing her
to the concert nowhere else and thinking
of her safety she continued that I
shouldn't have bought the tickets if I
was only tolerating doing so very true
very true I do accept I've made some
mistakes chiefly with us missing the
meet and greet the timing of the concert
should have made this an unforgettable
experience Mr grandma just died in my
ears
oh oh man
directed by M Night Shyamalan
yeah yeah you're the [ __ ] oh like it
honestly you sound like you wrote the
post and it sounds like your girlfriend
is a saint
because like you messed up a concert and
missed the meet and greet
for the dumbest reason of all time that
you were deleting a bunch of emails from
the concert venue is that you have like
a 16 megabyte storage cap on your Gmail
account or something like that
um she still seemed okay with that she
even suggested hey we're in the big city
Let's uh let's go out for a drink
world's dumbest man of all time said
no it's not safe here I'm not saying
that crime doesn't exist in this city
trust me you know I live in a city where
there is some at the same time you know
you're kind of you're rolling like a
d1000.
and 999 of the options
are gonna be okay
plus if your car was going to get broken
into it probably would have happened
during the concert anyway it's like uh
you don't leave like an open can of soda
out next to a beehive on a July
afternoon you know there's going to be a
stinger in there you know it if it was
going to happen you're probably not
changing your odds that much by going
out for a drink now you probably
shouldn't go out to a bar and then drive
home but it's like nobody's talking
about that for some reason but maybe I
maybe would have simply had like a low
ABV Rattler or something like that and
then but it's just
oh she said ride share home okay maybe
they are talking about that regardless
maybe he's scared that the ghost of her
Grandma's gonna haunt him well he should
be his grandma here grandma should be
haunting him he's not taking
her granddaughters well-being that
seriously
also I hate to
fabricate subtexts where it may not
exist but the last like paragraph of
this last two paragraphs it basically
seems like
he's like I spent 300 on this and I
didn't even get
to have sexual intercourse with my
girlfriend that's what like
when you're in a it's a weird line that
says I bought a gift for someone and
then at the end of the line you
resentfully say the night cost me over
300 like it seems like you it's kind of
just a creepy way to to frame the whole
thing
also I feel like if you had just gone
out for a drink in the city and then
taking an Uber home
and gotten out of your own way you might
not have had to write the post to begin
with it seems like she honestly forgave
you for missing the meet and greet even
though it was completely your fault and
she was still trying to have a good
evening and then
um when when she suggested it you were
like absolutely not under no
circumstance no discussion and she was
like why is my boyfriend like 17 years
old and so stubborn like why is he so
juvenile right
anyway but yeah I'd say you're the
[ __ ]
stop feeding the trolls it's a fake post
I don't know man maybe maybe not
you're the [ __ ]
you deliberately deleted the emails
because you found it annoying that she
asked as a result you missed what was
the main part of the gift for her then
you patronizingly told her there wasn't
a chance you'd do something else when
she was trying to salvage some measure
of specialness out of a ruin night you
acted like a petulant child when she
said she didn't want to go to the bar
near your apartment which isn't exactly
a special or memorable thing to do if
you go there all the time
and finally you misrepresented the whole
thing is is now about you not being
sufficiently enthusiastic about the band
info was it Imagine Dragons
because if so not the [ __ ] if it was
another band
almost anybody even if it was broke
inside you should just tolerate it if it
was Imagine Dragons I can understand
your hesitancy
satsune Miku
listen I that's why I feel like I'm so
able to comment on stuff like this I
took my wife to a Hatsune Miku concert
it was a three-hour drive in an
international border away we had to get
a hotel room
and I was surrounded by other tsune Miku
fans the whole time I was at the the
whole time I was at the arena
I ate this I'm not insulting Miku she
put on a great performance despite
having a sore throat okay
but it was like the most impolite series
of patrons I've ever seen at a concert
in my life the merch line was like
longer than the amount of people that
were actually going to see the concert
and people were like constantly trying
to cut in line they were cutting in line
but they weren't even being subtle about
it they were going like who cares who
cares who cares do just push in front of
these people and then when they would
like push in front we'd just be like oh
we're standing here and they'd go and
then they'd just walk behind us like
it's it was really
the concert itself was was great
everything the atmosphere surrounding
the concert gave me a very bad Vibe it
did not pass the vibe check okay
it's awful I'm not trying to go in that
hard but you know Josh it was like
you know how it packs
there will be people who have like their
camping backpack that is like bigger
than Norman Reedus's backpack in death
stranding and they'll they walk like
this and then without even checking
they're like doing a shoulder check they
just see something and they go whoa what
is dead Far Cry 6 trailer I've seen 70
times hey where do you guys and they're
like hidden people in the face with
their backpack
that was
not every Patron at the Hatsune Miku
concert okay
but it was more than the average concert
that's all I'm gonna say
I'm not gonna say we're the only
considerate people there because there
were other considerate people there
there were people that brought their
kids there and stuff like that but there
were also a lot of
a lot of young people with huge
backpacks going
anyway what songs did they sing
she did the one that was like
[Laughter]
you know that one
seabed
certified Banger That's a classic
you know the one where she starts going
off like Twista in slow jams
[Laughter]
that one
yes it's on my sex playlist
[Laughter]
it was an istuard I believe
anyway
oh
this guy's crazy
foreign
I'm just seeing what we got here okay
I'm just seeing if there's any more to
mine it has been two and a half hours
already almost at least oh man am I the
[ __ ] for putting dirty dishes away oh
come on
oh man
so i-16f can admit when it comes to
chores I've never had too many
responsibilities that's fine you're 16.
I have to take the dog out for a minimum
of 15 minutes a day keep my room clean
and put away the dishes understandable
my mom always does the dishes recently
my stepdad fixed our dishwasher and we
have been using it instead to make
things easier the first time we use the
dishwasher I started putting things away
and found a glass had broken no big deal
second time some of the things had
visible food and such still on them I
put them in the sink assuming they would
just get redone
assuming they would just get redone
by by whom the dish fairy
I had the same attitude to chores when I
was a kid you make a mess you're like
it'll get cleaned up
now I'm I'm the one doing some of the
cleaning up I won't say most because my
wife definitely does most but anytime
like my kid throws her spoon on the
ground when she's eating their dinner
I'm like this is a Betrayal on levels
never before seen
I've been doing this for about a week
putting a few utensils maybe a cup that
had visible food when my mom finally
talked to me she said I need to do my
chores right stop putting things in the
sink so I can just go back to my phone
quicker I said the only time I ever put
things in the sink was because they were
still dirty she said that was garbage
and I needed to stop her she would take
my phone for a bit
that's garbage
the next day as I was putting away the
dishes I saw some forks and spatulas
were still somewhat dirty and that a mug
had some dishwasher Gunk inside doing as
my mom told me I put everything away
when she came to the kitchen I sat at
the dinner table why should she grab the
spatula noticed it was dirty but just
sighed and put it in the sink and she
went to grab her mug she saw it was full
of dishwasher Gunk she looked over at me
and asked what I thought I was doing I
kindly said that I had put away all the
dishes you know this
it's not what she met
when she said don't put dirty dishes
from don't unload stuff from the
dishwasher into the sink she didn't mean
put dirty dishes where the clean dishes
go this is malicious compliance
you're not supposed to malicious
compliance your parents over petty stuff
like this you're supposed to like
malicious compliance your boss
your boss says don't bother coming in
tomorrow then you wake up at 9 00 a.m
you've got 20 texts that are like hey
where are you hey hey a bunch of people
called in sick hey oh we really need you
to open this door you're really letting
us down that's when you say oh my boss
told me not to come in this morning by
the way consider this my two weeks
notice you're not supposed to do it to
your to your parents over something as
Petty as as the dishwasher
it's too much
I don't know why she's feigning
ignorance that is like the my only two
choices were to put dirty dishes in the
sink or to put them where the clean
dishes go
anyway sorry she blew up and said that
if something was obviously dirty I I
should put it in the sink and not put it
away okay no wait maybe she's not wrong
now that I think about it
I pointed out the flaws in her argument
after that she took away my phone for
the day I don't think I did anything
really wrong but I want to know am I the
[ __ ] edit I would like to start off
by saying thank you for everyone's input
I do see how most of you see that I'm
the [ __ ] so I'm talking to my
tomorrow one thing I will also be doing
is telling her that sometimes I would
like her to listen to what I'm going to
say even if I am in the wrong
she's well on her way to being one of
the finest am I the [ __ ] posters of
all time
even if I'm wrong I would like you to
listen and agree with me please one last
thing I'd like to mention I saw a lot of
people saying I was a brat and I'll be
in for a rude awakening when I move out
that sounds like Reddit
you are wrong sorry between the ages of
7 and 11 my dad had a hella abusive
girlfriend and I was doing everything in
the house for myself my dad and his ex
along with his ex's kids I know how to
do these things they are not just my
responsibilities anymore or they're just
not my responsibilities anymore I am
also at the top of classes and on track
for some great universities and jobs I'm
also fully done writing a novel I plan
to publish before I'm 19. thank you for
listening no offense but I would love to
read that
edit number two so there was certain
comment that you have apparently been
downvoting which I think is terrible as
this person has made me think of the
situation and really my whole life in
another light someone mentioned okay
someone mentioned how they're autistic
and sometimes don't understand things
right away I relate to that a lot okay
I'm not I've taken away my shouting
voice and I brought it down to a
reasonable level of the volume and
decorum again
I honestly don't care if you guys think
I'm the [ __ ] or not anymore as I'm
already sorting out the situation with
my mom and everyone calling me
horrendous things is just making me very
upset those of you calling me things an
absolutely terrorizing me as a human
need to grow up you are an adult who got
so annoyed with a teenager having an
argument with their mom that you decide
to bully her grow up so true so true
user received Reddit Gold for this post
now mind you I'm not the one who wrote
The Post in the first place but also I
get it you're a teenager I don't I sort
of I know I've said this a lot today I
sort of don't understand the problem
with this
the mom did not give clear instructions
if a dish comes out of if the dishwasher
runs and a dish comes out that's still
dirty
what did the mom want her to do she got
mad at her for putting it in the sink
what I would do is when something's
dirty and it's in the dishwasher
I run it if it is still dirty I leave it
in the dishwasher and run it one more
time on the next cycle if it's still
dirty I throw it in the garbage can that
shit's never getting clean
it had two chances it led me down twice
happy birthday to the ground
maybe clean it by hand well the thing is
I've done it enough that now everything
all the other dishes are on notice so
they get clean in the dishwasher
they're like look at what happened to
Forkey
Forkey had the audacity to have some
marinara stuck to him for two dishwasher
cycles and we never saw him again
and now they're all in the dishwasher
going
so it hasn't been a problem but not
everybody runs their house the same kind
of Marine Corps standards that I do
that really hurt my neck it really hurt
my neck
also it sounds like your stepdad did a
really shitty job of fishing fixing the
dishwasher it's if multiple dishes are
coming out of the dishwasher still dirty
consistently something's not right with
the dishwasher a hose is blocked you
need to put some like uh like pre-washed
solution in it or something are you are
you putting soap in it I don't
understand like it sounds like you might
need to have like a plumber actually
come look at it maybe you got to clean
the filters or you gotta you gotta
pre-rinse some particularly Saucy dishes
and stuff like that like
you can't just throw gunked up stuff in
the dishwasher and expect it to come out
spotless I mean sometimes you'll get
lucky but
anyway
yeah I don't I listen I don't understand
the problem with this
I honestly I'm going to say not the
[ __ ] I didn't say it sounds like your
mom did not give you clear instructions
and I know this is an inversion of what
I said earlier
I thought the child was just being
needlessly petulant but it actually
seems like they were confused about what
to do with the dirty dishes as they came
out of the dishwasher
putting them in the sink to be hand
washed makes the most sense even though
it does seem like you're offloading your
job of doing the
of unloading the dishwasher you are kind
of shuffling a task around to another
person but within the silo of of your
chore
partitioning it seems to make sense to
me it doesn't seem it doesn't seem
malicious
the mom should be the one who says you
would okay if something comes out of the
dishwasher dirty maybe there's like two
forks why don't you just hand wash them
that seems like the only thing you gotta
like she should have just said that
also her novel is probably sick
you think there's a chance that it's a
100 science based Dragon MMO
would I be the [ __ ] for saying the
way I want my fiance to split the down
payment is unfair
I love talking about real estate on
Twitch
it always gets chat riled up it always
gets me riled up
reveals a lot about our society
my fiance and I have been looking to buy
our first house let me first say great
timing
we recently had an offer accepted on a
house yes because you were the only ones
offering no like I'm not trying to be
rude I'm just they were probably like oh
my God
we'll take it
she was given 25 from a parent to go
towards the down payment the remaining
down payment amount is twenty thousand I
perhaps unfairly assumed we would put
down the 25
000 and then both put ten thousand
dollars from our own savings she wants
to split the 45
000 so she puts 22.5 000 from her dad's
gift and nothing from her personal
savings and I put 22.5
000 which is almost a hundred percent of
my savings I can see both sides but
can't help but feel it's unfair to put
me in that position so would I be the
[ __ ] for asking to put the 25 down
and split the remaining 20K in half
I just want to add some clarity to my
point of view it's not that I don't want
to pay my share it's just a bit
suffocating when it's 95 percent of my
savings perhaps agreeing on a payment
plan between us could be an option how
how to know without being rude how to
know your relationship is in trouble is
it possible we could come up with some
sort of payment plan where I could give
my fiance a stipend every month
that's
what kind of uh interest rate do you
think your fiance is going to give you
on that loan do you think she's going to
give you like Prime minus two that would
be that's a sweetheart rate
a lot of people would say zero I don't
think that's realistic in today's
environment honestly I think I think
Prime minus two prime plus one
we see the mafia
edit sorry I guess I unfairly took it to
mean that this was exciting to some
extent a gift to help us both it seems a
lot of people think I am talking about
the entire payments I'm not we would pay
the monthly mortgage 50 50. so out of
450 000 total we are talking about forty
five thousand dollar down payment and
have that a difference of ten versus
22.5 k
answering some common questions yes
dates set for wedding next summer 10
possible as first-time home buyers loan
we earn very similarly no debts for
either of us perhaps lack of clarity is
true regarding gift but I was given the
impression it was more for us to buy our
first home okay I'm
I yes I was I did want to know where
they live
that's that was the question for me
um but I don't think we're going to get
that info but I'm just interested in the
specifics
because I feel like when I've been
walking around Vancouver and like a year
ago two years ago
um anytime there was a a placard that
said like it's an open house uh there
was always like 50 people huddling next
to the sign uh being led into the house
in in groups of like six now when I this
is genuinely I swear to you as an honest
story I walked by one of the the the
stands and I just looked at the listing
because I was like oh I'm curious to see
if prices have gone down because
obviously rates have come so far up I
didn't realize it was the realtor
standing in front of the house with
their arms crossed she said don't be shy
you should check it out and I said oh no
I'm just browsing uh and then she said
it's a new build it's really nice and I
said it's okay we bought in 2019 and she
said oh okay have a nice day like
they're actually now
having to do like they're having they
need to start offering like free samples
of stuff to get people to come to the
open houses like nobody's biting
yeah I didn't know people like window
shop for a house apparently they would
just like walk by a sign and be like I
guess I'll buy it
but regardless
I'm like
I mean I guess I'm just talking around
the issue right here I don't know this
is a complicated one that's not fun
that's a complicated
question
I personally now this is not me saying
this is the objective way to handle the
situation
if we were buying a house and my parents
gave me a gift and said this is like
for you and the subtext was it was to
help you know get you onto the property
ladder I would think that that would
represent my
like
all of that would be in addition to what
I was also I'm trying to think about the
way that I'm phrasing this
I would not think that that gift was
like now I don't have to use my savings
for the down payment instead I would
think that it's like now we can make our
down payment like a little higher so the
principal level on our mortgage is a
little lower I would think of that as
being in addition to
the amount that we had saved to purchase
the house in the first place if we could
make the the numbers work
but I also completely understand being
like it's my dad that gave me the gift
so like why doesn't your dad if you want
to be treated equally then maybe your
dad should give you an equivalent gift
and then we could both have the same
amount in our savings account or
something like that like I can at least
understand it
so
I uh I mean I'm not saying that nobody's
the [ __ ] but I do kind of feel like
this is like a nobody sucks here this is
like just an actual
I don't want to say conflict but it's a
it's a point of contention for sure
I don't know I don't know what the
resolution is
[Laughter]
I gotta see the con I the fact that this
is so like 50 50 for me means there must
be some insane comments because this one
is you're the [ __ ]
let's see
you want to own 50 of the house but you
expect your fiancee to contribute 35 000
and you only ten thousand I honestly
can't completely follow the logic about
how that's fair in your eyes what are
your plans for the future children find
okay the second it's always they always
take it one step too far
also like in the whole scheme of things
sure there's it's a disproportionate
amount for the
down payment
but that doesn't mean that she's paying
for 75 percent of the house and then
he's paying for 25 of the house it's
just it's this is like a 52-48 sort of
situation by the time you finish the
mortgage
I don't understand the
I don't understand the problem
also what does it have to do with her
kids if they have kids in the future I
should say
but the fiance is not using any of her
own money well she is because the gift
was given to her
I don't like you know I I think that to
some extent it depends on the
on the the the
origin of the gift
did the dad say hey you guys are buying
a house here's twenty five thousand
dollars for the down payment
or did the dad say you know you guys are
starting a life together here's twenty
five thousand dollars to help out
because if he just said
life's expensive here's 25 Grand that's
her money as far as I'm concerned
if he said it's for the house then
but even
I'm like I still don't feel like
I don't know man again the way that I
would handle this in in my own household
is I would go oh sick 25 extra grand for
the down payment that'll lower our
mortgage payments especially with you
know interest rates hovering around like
six percent right now that's actually
going to save us like an appreciable
amount of money in the long term but the
way that they're handling it here I also
don't think it's that crazy that she's
like I am using the gift for my portion
and you should use your savings for the
other portion but then like eight months
legally speaking they're all tied up
together all your finances are tied up
together anyway
so it seems like you I don't know who's
in the wrong and who should just bite
the bullet on this one but still
I don't it's complicated okay
I got nothing for this one I just want
to see some crazy comments okay
okay this comment deleted by a user that
received gold for this post
you need to have a serious talk about
how you're going to handle money as a
couple yes but can we talk
of this issue
issue and solved the issue without
telling me you can't solve the issue as
soon as you start saying you guys need
to have a serious yeah but can we take
this to the can we take this to a
fiduciary and get it untangled a little
bit
I need I need help
there are a lot of [ __ ] here but
they're mostly in the comments not the
[ __ ] what is this weird Obsession
that couples have to split the down
payment exactly 50 50. we have no idea
what the finances of this couple are who
earns more who has more debt who has
more savings are they in similar
positions financially I think it's
shitty of the fiance can we not use
harsh language please
to not only take nothing out of her
personal savings but profit 2500 off the
gift from a parent that seems like it
was clearly intended to go 100 towards
the home while leaving the person she
loves with basically zero savings to
take care of emergencies or or squeeze a
little bit of enjoyment out of life I
paid 100 of the down payment on our home
my husband and I just weren't at the
same place financially we'd either have
to wait years for him to catch up or
leave him with zero savings for the
first several years of our marriage we
paid her paid into shared expenses in
proportion to our earnings and yes that
means I often played two paid two thirds
of our expenses and he picked up the
remaining one-third we've readjusted
over the years as his income has started
to catch up with mine I never wanted to
have him feeling like he doesn't have
the wiggle room to grab a beer with
friends or enjoy a new video game
especially when I have funds for large
indulgences like girls weekends
my credit card statement looks like this
sixty dollars steam FIFA 23 so hers can
look like this first class flight Newark
to Las Vegas four days stay at the Paris
Hotel and Resort uh 350 bottle service
at the at uh Cosmopolitan Hotel Las
Vegas uh the Uber Uber Uber sorry
true but also based she's girl bossing
it was nice that she still left them
with enough money to buy some video
games okay
it's nice that she still let him but get
the damn battle pass okay
what you need to do is have a
conversation with your fiance about big
picture finances it might be reasonable
to contribute in proportion to your
savings it might be reasonable to have
you contribute all of your savings
except for a small cushion there's a
bunch of reasonable ways to handle it
what's important is that you both talk
about it and come to an agreement oh I
mean it's not wrong
it's not written in fact it's it's right
it's more than not wrong it's like very
right
but I still don't wait I want like a cut
and dry solution though I want to cut
and dry solution
to a complicated scenario and I'm not
getting one you're the [ __ ] you said
it yourself she was given 25k by her
father that money is hers not a joint
asset
yeah but he's not gonna have any savings
left but also it was a gift from her
father
I need the we need to interview the
father okay
we need I think we can't solve this
until we we need to have the father set
up with a polygraph and then ask him if
he thought the gift was going to go
exclusively to the down payment
I think the only solution for this one
is that she gives the gift back to her
father
and then they take out a worse Mortgage
in order for them both to feel like they
were treated equally
I'm really conflicted by this one maybe
because my partner started when my
partner and I started living together we
shared everything I went on vacation
with my grandma to visit other family on
the other side of the country the other
family gave me 200 cash for whatever you
want to use it on my accommodations were
paid and I had my trip spending money
the 200 was a gift you know what I did
with it I wired it to my boyfriend to
put towards our bills
okay when I was the breadwinner it was
our money when he became the head of
household it was our money my
grandfather is a farmer grandkids got
crop checks for Christmas ranging from
2K to 8K you know what I did with those
checks I put it towards our future can I
get somebody that actually works a real
job to tell me what a crop check is
are these subsidies from the from the
United States government
yes okay
is that why the housing Market's so
[ __ ]
U.S governments paying Farmers to plant
corn the farmers are passing it on to
their 17 kids to juice their down
payments
tell my shit's so damn expensive
not to mention they're buying
mortgage-backed Securities in March 2021
with the housing markets up 40 annually
year over year and rates are at 25 basis
points and your fed is still buying
mortgage-backed Securities in March 2021
the prop up a market that's overheating
what are you doing man
sorry my did I did my vein pop out
a little lion sauce for you
and the banks
you guys don't sound like you're on the
same team but that's just my opinion
from experience lots of people don't
combine finances but still manage to be
a team it's not about me it's about us
and I'm getting that vibe from the info
here
you're the [ __ ] it doesn't matter
where she got them okay sure whatever
fair enough I'm done with this one
have you considered wearing a heart rate
monitor when you do this okay hold on I
I'm gonna be honest with you okay let's
let's check can I get a stopwatch I'm
gonna do a stopwatch on my phone
for 15 seconds okay and then I'm gonna
do a multiply by four I'm not gonna lie
to you okay
three two one start
okay I had 16 Beats
times four
sixty heart rate 64.
when I was amped up
I'm feeling like Pierce Brosnan from Die
Another Day
holy cow dude it's
that's not bad
that's not bad at all
because that's the way the heart works
right it's like you only get a certain
number of Beats like for your life
like how your Logitech mouse only had
it's good for like 10 million clicks or
something like that
so if you lower your resting heart rate
you've extended the the life
span of your planned obsolescence
all right one more quick one one more
quick one one more quick just a nice
round three hours react Court
am I the [ __ ] for insulting my
brother's fiance the same way she
insults others
why is my screen region wrong
doesn't seem right
hello am I the [ __ ] for insulting my
brother's fiancee the same way she
insults others
so this drama revolves around my
brother's fiance Sarah is dramatic and
gossipy it always has to be something
with her she's always talking about how
someone else is in a negative light
behind their backs and I can't stand it
to tell you the truth however you're
doing the same [ __ ] right now
double stand literally you're gossiping
about Sarah right now behind her back to
strangers
you're not even getting any like human
bonds out of it
heart rate
still low still low still low
however I put it aside because she's my
future sister-in-law and I just want to
keep the peace I and my sisters always
have a girls night out once a month when
my other brother married his wife Angie
we started to invite her out with us as
well because we all like her when Sarah
learned about these nights she has to
join us once she was engaged and we
agreed even though most of us don't like
her
she has never liked Angie which has
always made the nights harder to deal
with because Sarah will just ignore her
Angie is an angel and puts up with it
though okay
last week Angie was sick and missed the
night Sarah took it as an opportunity to
trash talk her all night Angie does not
have a college degree and only has her
GED
O.J no Pope trash
the dish
done I get you a little buzz on because
I know your roommates have been on your
last nerve
so I have to tell you my entire
educational history has been something
of a fraud
cheap cheap chick in the city
sorry it's too far bad chest bad chest
Sarah has her Masters in biology and
intelligence is one of her favorite
things to insult people on well after I
got a bit drunk I had enough of it
Angie's one of the sweetest people I've
ever met and has never once said a bad
thing about Sarah after Sarah finished
one of her insults about Angie being the
farthest from traditionally intelligent
I said
is the reason you're insulting Angie
here like a coward because she's
traditionally beautiful and you're the
furthest from it
Sarah is about uh info Sarah is about
300 pounds and by all regards quite ugly
all right well that's like
you went in a little hard
this is a massive trigger point for her
as well as I know she has emotional
issues surrounding her weight we got
into a fight and I ended up tearing her
appearance apart Point by point until
she was visibly near tears in the end I
told her I'm only doing exactly what she
does when she gossips about people I
only talked about her like this the way
she talks about others just to her face
unlike her that night was pretty much
ruined by this and we all went home
separately well now all hell has broken
loose Sarah's demanding an apology I
will not give it to her my sisters agree
that what I said is directly in line
with what Sarah says about others yeah
they're your sisters
but disagree with me and said I should
have not lowered myself to her level
last night I got a call from my brother
and now Sarah is threatening to postpone
their marriage if I don't apologize
which in my opinion says more about her
than anything I could have said but
actually I feel bad now that I've had
time to think about it okay that's human
emotions doing the what they're supposed
to do that's called remorse or guilt
uh you're supposed to
you're supposed to Stew in that feeling
for a little bit decide you don't like
it
um apologize even if you don't think
you're 100 in the wrong and remember
that in the future when you feel like
going thermonuclear over something like
this that's that's the way that that's
supposed to go
I think that's a sign that you're a
relatively good person who made a
mistake that you feel bad about it
afterwards so that's okay
but you did not insult Sarah the way she
insults others just to be clear that's a
you've drawn a false equivalence
Sarah insults others behind their back
you insulted her to her face and I'm
just being straight up with you I know a
lot of people are like I would rather
get insulted to my face
nah
I'd rather you keep it to your your
private Discord chats and your and your
group chats and your DMs and your little
getting like a little boozy brunch
together and like I didn't know oh wow
and L's been looking a little tubby
lately I'd rather you do that than say
it to my face I don't want to hear that
[ __ ]
absolutely not
I'd rather you place it somewhere that I
don't uh that I don't see it quite
frankly
[Laughter]
put it on our slash Super Auto pets yeah
exactly
so I think you actually you went a
little bit higher on the
the aggression you you went you she was
going like five minutes from Midnight
you were going Two Minutes to Midnight
okay
I hate that because of what Kanye West
said I can no longer say Defcon I used
to say Defcon all the time and people
knew what I meant except sometimes you
had to explain that as the Defcon
numbers get lower you get closer to
Danger
so you would say like oh she went def
con too
and it would be like that doesn't sound
that bad I'm like brother that's almost
the damn worse but now you can't even
say it anymore he he ruined an analogy
I've been using for like 10 years
now I gotta use the Doomsday Clock and
so you can't even say two minutes to
midnight it's already been taken by Iron
Maiden
anyway I don't know sure everybody sucks
here that seems fair although I don't
know like honestly
listen
this is not going to make me sound like
a good person
if someone's gossiping about another
person that you like
you don't need to like go off on them to
their face and like tear them down
what would a cool guy do in that
situation he would say hey
we all love Angie here let's not talk
about her behind her back and then try
to have a good night
and maybe like don't invite her out ever
again
foreign
let's not talk about our friend like
that she's not here to defend herself
that's the way that should be at least
step one
but like
at the same time I guess I can't say
that uh
everybody doesn't suck here
she did call her the farthest thing from
traditionally intelligent
was that wrong
was it wrong for her to
was it wrong for her to call their
mutual friend the the
dictionary definition of stupid
emblematic of the exact meaning of the
phrase
dumb as a rock was that was that bad
was that over the line
Counterpoint how dumb is Angie this is
an info request
is she like Jessica Simpson in the
newlyweds dumb
or is she like uh Charlie Day and It's
Always Sunny in Philadelphia dumb
she got a head like a box of rocks I I
mean it's just it matters I need to know
maybe she is
I don't know man
anyway that was fun
it's react cord okay slash marker
react Court that's



a little just the slightest bit of
mucosal
that's all you get you don't got nothing
to worry about anymore I'm feeling
fantastic we're doing react chord okay
react chord is where we look at some of
the most insane creative writing prompts
that have ever been written one of the
finest fiction Minds the world has ever
known
and we check it out here's one for
example am I the [ __ ] for missing my
father-in-law's funeral I have my mother
after my mother-in-law booked my husband
first class but me economy that can't
conceivably be a true story but at the
same time I want to check it out when
you say great title are you talking
about my title the pistachio disguise of
twitch or are you talking about the
title of the am I the [ __ ] post I got
really happy that you were complimenting
me and then I realized it's almost
certainly the the title of the am I the
[ __ ] post but we can pretend
hold on let me hydrate I know you guys
like you'd love the water bottle you
missed the water bottle
um
it's back
that's what happens when you uh when you
ride the Peloton in the morning I got I
got a liter of pure H2O left over
only a slight bit of backwash in it okay
this is react chord real do not get it
twisted
am I the [ __ ] for missing my
father-in-law's funeral after my
mother-in-law booked my husband first
class but me economy me and my
mother-in-law don't have a close
relationship sorry they don't have a
close Rel
seitan ship she's civil towards me but
can be a bit passive aggressive at times
and we tend to disagree often times
describes
um your relationship with
and I don't mean yours in op I mean this
is everybody's relationship with about
99 of the human population it's not that
bad
I mean it's not it would be nice if you
guys were closer but it's not that big
of a deal we live in a different state
father-in-law passed away suddenly
mother-in-law told me and my husband to
come attend the funeral she booked our
tickets to fly to her state with the
issue started when my husband told me we
couldn't sit together in the plane
because his mom had booked him a first
class ticket well I got economy I was
flabbergasted by this I tried asking him
why but he urged me to suck it up and
we'll talk about it later in that moment
that particular moment I felt so in in
that why is it written like a musical in
that moment that particular moment
I felt so much humiliation and contempt
I felt like she was treating me even
less as less than even in her hard times
I decided to not go and just go back
home my husband was shocked by my
decision to go home and tried to
convince me to go but I declined
he went alone and I ended up missing the
funeral he was livid just calling M3
he was calling his car
texting nasty things calling me Petty
and spoiled he said I should be grateful
his mom paid for my ticket to begin with
then said that she doesn't owe me a
goddamn thing I argued about how she
could have just booked us both an
economy if money is an issue but he
called me pathetic for thinking about it
when his dad just died he said it was
cruel what I did and that his mom and
family will never forget that I missed
the funeral over ridiculous reasons am I
the [ __ ] for going home over this
um
you know what I realized and and I I've
realized this a long time ago but it's
it's nice for this to be put into a more
coalescable form if that makes sense
okay
some people don't see their life as a
comedy
some people take life very very very
seriously
now I'm kind of a serious guy in some
ways I try to you know
um I live my life according to a series
of values a code if you will Jonathan at
the Continental you do not shoot anybody
in the head at the continental
restaurant Jonathan or you'll be
disbarred we will confiscate all your
gold pirate coins Jonathan
but if this happened to me
hypothetically
I think I would instantly
switch into
Ben Stiller in Meet the Parents mode
I would feel like I'm in a um early
2000s like romantic comedy I think I
would find it a little humorous if if my
wife's parents bought my wife a first
class ticket and they bought me an
economy ticket
I'll admit that it's not really fair
because I have like a I have a an outlet
for absurdity like when something that
might annoy other people happens to me
in public it's less annoying sometimes
because I know I get to farm it for
content on Twitch but I think I would
laugh at it both at the time and like
also probably like a hundred times as I
told the story over and over again until
people listening to me got sick of it
it would have been I mean it's almost
like you gave me a gift
rather than have a first class ticket
you gave me you gave me a story that I
can tell for like hopefully the next 50
years or something like that
I also like I don't know people
so you gotta consider your phrasing here
but
people are really
blowing up if this is a true story which
is probably not but people are really
blowing up their families
over like the slightest Injustice right
it's not that I I get that you would be
offended that your mother-in-law did
this but is it really worth blowing up
like your relationship with your husband
and and your husband's family just
because you feel disrespected
you're gonna get disrespected from time
to time I don't know if this is good
advice
but like there's some situations where
you say hey knock that [ __ ] off treat me
better than that and then there's some
situations where you say all right I'm
gonna eat that one up
that's just one like to be honest with
you got to tank that one assuming this
is a real story
it's your husband's dad's funeral
you're on an airplane for you know what
the what's the longest flight between
two states in the United States
JFK to Honolulu or something like that
what's that like six hours but in all
likelihood this is probably like a three
hour flight
suck it up for three hours and then you
laugh with your husband about how your
mother-in-law treats you differently or
I mean like to be honest and I'm being
straight up with you I know this hero is
not a word that we use lightly okay but
if this happened to me if my parents
which they wouldn't because they'd love
my wife but if my parents bought me a
first class ticket
and Kate an economy ticket
I would let her take the first class
ticket
even if I was grieving I would let her
take the first class ticket
so I do think that the husband could
have nipped this one in the bud
his dad died though so what you're
grieving in first class versus grieving
in economy
he's going to be like bawling his eyes
out he's like nothing
nothing could bring my dad back but it
would be really nice to have a a chair
that converts into a lie down bed
it's not that big of a deal like you got
you got bigger problems right
um
if anything if you're truly suffering
you might as well sit in coach
because it's a proper environment for it
and let your wife like
I I look I can't really put myself in
their shoes okay
but I might be like hey you know my my
dad died I'm just gonna like you know
put my head up against the window and
like try to take a nap or like close my
eyes or something like that why don't
you go in first class and have like a
few mimosas I'm not saying like you
should party it up but like you know
that's the right environment I don't
really feel like celebrating in first
class with uh
with the the creme de La Creme of
society here you know
who knows here's the thing she could be
doing some networking up there too
you're not in a position to network I've
always said your network is your net
worth so she could be she could be
schmoozing a little bit up there well
you're a little out of commission
I'm just saying that's what I would do
okay
um but really all I'm trying to do is
illustrate that there's like
many different solutions that could have
come along the way to prevent this from
getting to the point where like you and
your husband might get a divorce just
because like you didn't want to sit in a
slightly less comfortable chair I get
that it's not about the chair but it is
about the chair because you could have
made it about the chair if you just sat
down in the chair you're actually
annoyed because the mother-in-law is
respecting you less than she respects
her own son which of course like you
expected you know if push came to shove
your parents would have your back and be
in your corner instead of you know the
corner of your spouse but you know we
all got to pretend that it's like yeah
yes yeah Kate's parents love me as much
as they love their own daughter of
course like no doubt about it anyway but
the point is you don't have to let it
get to that point to begin someone's got
a tank someone's got to take the role of
Ben Stiller and meet the parents that
takes all the abuse and just puts a
smile on their face and then lets it all
out later and says can you deal with
that
although to be fair Ben Stiller in Meet
the Parents
most of the time he's the good guy but
he does do some unredeemable stuff
for example
he loses Robert De Niro's prized cat
and then gets another cat from the
animal shelter and paints like a stripe
on it so that it looks like the cat and
then anyway long story that's the big
one
jinxy
so yeah I mean I think
I mean it's no doubt that it's like
everyone sucks here
like the Mother-in-law should have
bought them tickets both on the same
level but I also think that the hey when
whether that's too first class or two
economy they should be sitting together
because it's the emotional support
between them that's the most important
part but
the wife here also sucks because she
didn't have to throw like a nail bomb
into her family over this she could have
just sat in coach and like watched
a movie
and you know eating some pita chips or
something like that and then like then
it's no big deal you just eat it for a
few hours and then you know
do your job no offense but
you know your job is to just be it's not
your
family's funeral you know you're
supposed to be there and you're like
emotional support okay you're thanking
and support which doesn't seem fair but
it's not worth blowing up the whole
Squad okay
anyway
This Thread is now locked doing it due
to an excess of rule violations
this is a picture of my dog sleeping
okay
that's fine read the edit I read it what
do you want me to say like this doesn't
change anything one of the reasons I
didn't settle for the economy ticket is
because I wanted to sit next to my
husband and support him he sobbed the
whole ride of the airport and I didn't
want to leave his side okay and the
other reason is that I felt disrespected
by
um the uh I felt disrespected by my
mother-in-law and then the other reason
is that economy is not as nice as first
class
that is true as well I didn't want to
leave his side until he told me we
couldn't sit together at which point I
left his side for the entire weekend
rather than leave it for three hours
entirely
everybody sucks here the seat issue was
more important than supporting your
husband after the death of his father
that is exactly the point obviously
mother-in-law is an [ __ ] interactions
were uncalled for but you made your
husband go to his father's funeral
without the support of his spouse and he
did this over a first class seat you may
have caused irreparable damage to your
marriage
I don't think that's uh I don't think
that's false I'm going to say no
falsehoods detected
you're the [ __ ] yes it was very
shitty user received Reddit shooting
star for this post by the way it was
very shitty from your mother-in-law to
book you an economy class while your
husband was in first class but you let a
petty I love the Bold text man I love
the BB code
but you let a petty quarrel with your
mother-in-law prevent your from
supporting your husband when he needed
you the most I won't know I won't say
everybody sucks here the husband doesn't
suck and the Mother-in-law just lost her
lifelong partner have to pay for plane
tickets for two persons and she wanted
to pay a little treat to her son
I am giving her the benefit of the doubt
that she did this to spoil her son not
to piss off her Dill
I still think that makes her an [ __ ]
I mean not like is died in the wool like
every action she takes is an [ __ ] but
like it's an [ __ ] move
I don't think it's like when your spouse
dies I don't think you get like a one
month long period where you're in like a
mini Purge where you can do whatever you
want free of judgment you consider the
actions within the context of the
emotional situation that the person's in
but
maybe you should
this would be a lawless Society man
people are dying all the time
you're crazy
when you get a cold you do I couldn't
commit crimes I could just say some
messed up and problematic stuff and then
immediately do my impression of uh Colin
Farrell from the Batman and say I'm
literally just a guy what are you doing
at me okay
anyway
I mean I agree with this
point one to the Mother-in-law she will
now forever be able to say she didn't
even come to the funeral look how she
didn't support my son in his time of
need and don't get me wrong the
mother-in-law is a complete [ __ ] for
this but no one in the family will care
about the plane seats they'll just
remember op wasn't there okay I mean I
agree with a lot of this but
this is actually how some people see
their familial relationships and that's
very that's very sad to me
you literally just had an unforced error
to your mother-in-law your mother-in-law
she has an advantage over you she's
about to break your serve okay
you had service
you got a single fault
and then an unforced error
you blundered your queen in the fifth
set not to mix metaphors
you gave your mother-in-law an end one
in a tie game in the fourth quarter
everybody sucks here your mother-in-law
won
well it can get crazier apparently I
apologize for getting stun locked by the
relatively sane comment
it was most likely her intention to
cause a fight and she won because you
didn't go now she gets to bash you for
not attending you didn't support your
hubs when he needed it so now all the
nasty things she Whispers in his ear
while he's there he's going to agree
re-u
H you were put in a losing situation
either way this whole thing sucks sorry
this happened to you hey you [ __ ] up
really bad sorry this happened you would
love to know your thoughts on this
listen can I say that like
we're gonna this is gonna cause some
disagreement in chat everybody sucks
here also includes the husband
he could have solved the issue the same
way that the the wife could have been
stillered it the husband could have been
stillarded now I understand in context
he's grieving obviously so he's a not
thinking straight and B emotionally
vulnerable that being said at any moment
he could have stepped in and said can
you can I get a downgrade
can uh uh will trade seats like I'm
gonna text my mom and tell her like when
we got the tickets I'm gonna text my mom
and tell her like that's not cool why
don't you just put us both in economy
and save your money instead like there's
so many different opportunities for him
to have completely it's like listen if
you're walking and you're walking on the
train tracks you shouldn't be doing that
to begin with you definitely shouldn't
go into the tunnel
he must have gotten the uh an email that
was like hey honey here's your flights
home and then he looked at it and said
well I'm in seat 1A and she's in seat
like 35 J
and then emailed his mom and been like
hey you know this is three I understand
what you're trying to do here but like I
want to be sit with my wife throughout
the entirety of the flight okay
so I either get us two first class
tickets or you can downgrade mine and
and save your money and spend it on
yourself because you're grieving as well
but I will like the the core of this
issue for me is so common on am I the
[ __ ] which is I refuse to ever ever
be even slightly disrespected and not
like some of them are like my wife
slightly disrespected me um what should
I do and all the comments are like it
could literally be some [ __ ] like she
ate my shredded cheese out of the bag in
the fridge when I told her not to Once
even though she was really hungry
everyone in the comments is like she
doesn't respect you get a divorce before
she does which is crazy but then some of
them are like my wife's
nephew said something to me at a family
gathering and my wife didn't tell him to
knock it off what should we do and
everybody's like literally you got to
get out of this family they're crazy
this [ __ ] happens all the time
like if you're if your spouse is doing
something disrespectful to you
consistently and you tell them to knock
it off and they keep doing it that's one
thing but like you know your your spouse
is relative
doing something once that's like a mild
slight and then blowing up your whole
life over it is is idiocy
this pride comes before the fall
there are no sane people on Reddit
though that's true that's fair enough
we'll see what else we got
I I only want to see the the [ __ ]
ones but I can read the the titles of
the not the [ __ ] ones
am I the [ __ ] for yelling at my
husband when he ate some of my chocolate
and make making him drive across the
city to replace it
I would say that I'm not surprised that
that's not the [ __ ] am I the [ __ ]
for calling out my husband's co-worker's
wife for trying to flush a maxi pad down
the toilet
people are crazy about Plumbing
this one's just it seems Petty but
people take the plumbing very seriously
you should have seen the way my mom
reacted when I told her I like cleaned
up some cat vomit
with a single square of paper towel
and then I went to throw it in the
garbage and she said don't throw it in
the garbage it'll smell and I said okay
I'll just flush it down the toilet she
looked at me like I just told her like I
had two days to live
flush it down the toilet
you can't flush
paper towel down the toilet it'll clog
up the sewer system for the whole city
millions of people's pipes
I'm gonna get
clogged as a result of that have you no
sympathy for the people in the I was
like okay fine I'll throw it in the
garbage then I'll deal with the smell
and my sense of smell hasn't been the
same since I was like 15 for some reason
so I graduated high school went to
college and then like a week later I was
like
I can't smell anything
can't smell anything at all
anybody else in the same boat same
what's up with that
you know what I think it was I think it
was
um
when I had my first beer my body just
took all the blood that was going to my
nose and said go to the liver instead
you know we had a good run keep
breathing of course
but we need that we need this material
elsewhere
I can still smell food
and like cat
poop which is helpful that's about it
though
am I the [ __ ] my boyfriend found my
clean Period Panties and made me feel
crappy about it
your boyfriend found clean underwear and
made fun of you for it of course you're
not the [ __ ] okay here the insanity
am I the [ __ ] for telling my sister
to stop taking showers with her oh okay
maybe not Insanity I thought this was am
I the [ __ ] for telling my sister to
top stop taking showers with my husband
in my house
am I the [ __ ] for telling
my sister to stop taking showers with
her husband in my house
what
this feels like a yes for sure
my my sister and her husband
moved in with us two days ago after they
lost their apartment to medical debts
for their child my nephew my husband and
I are more than happy to have them stay
for a few weeks till they get this
resolved except
here we go
I'm ready
yesterday at 7 pm I was in the kitchen
when my husband rushed in and said that
he saw both my sister and her husband
walk out of the bathroom they'd most
likely taken a shower together my
husband said that it irked him and I
agreed what they did was somewhat
inappropriate he asked me to speak to my
sister on the matter and I did she got
defensive asking how this is affecting
me or my husband in any way
I told her it made my husband feel
uncomfortable and would rather they just
took their showers separately she
started ranting about being overwhelmed
by their son's health problems and not
having some alone time together as a
married couple and found this activity
as a bonding time to spend together I
apologize for how she felt
but requested that she just do as asked
hey all that [ __ ] that you said makes a
lot of sense
I get it you're going through a hard
time you're a married couple who should
care to begin with i i i i at the same
time can you just do what you're told as
long as you're under my roof uh I don't
know if you're familiar with the my
house my rules Act
it became law uh never but we all
somehow agree that that's the way that
the the system should be run
she got mad at me and said I was being
inconsiderate she didn't understand my
husband's hang up on what she and her
husband do we started arguing and she
stormed off to the guest room where my
nephew and brother-in-law were she's not
speaking to me but my husband said I did
the right thing by speaking to her and
setting this boundary am I the [ __ ]
some info
my husband did not mention hearing
anything
just that he saw them get out of the
bathroom and yes they were clothed
that doesn't mean what does that have to
do with anything
you could be close I'm clothed when I go
into the bathroom I'm clothed when I
come out of the bathroom I'm naked when
I'm in there
I don't understand like what's the
problem
this is just like irrelevant info
it's the only bathroom in the house they
spent approximately 10 plus in the
shower according to my husband
approximately 10 plus minutes
for two people to shower
are they not aware that we're in drought
level four conditions right now
I'm going to bring my husband to look at
the responses and help me answer some
questions down here okay just give me a
few minutes
I'm sorry I can't respond to every
single comment but my husband says he's
uncomfortable and doesn't want to expand
on this situation
this is madness even ignoring the
mitigating scenarios of your sister and
her husband being forced to live with
you because they lost their apartment
because their child is ill
like even if you because which makes
their situation that much more
sympathetic even if you remove that this
is insane
I don't know if people are listen again
Hero's not a word we use lightly
if I had a house with a guest room and I
invited a married couple to stay with us
for a night for a weekend for a couple
days
if they
you have sexual intercourse with each
other that's kind of the cost of doing
business
I don't understand what the I'm not
saying they have to because that's like
equally weird but like
they can if they want to
it's not like abnormal I don't
understand the problem
I'm not going to invite like a a couple
that's romantically linked into my house
and be like under no circumstances is
that allowed because maybe because I'm
like a normal human being
it's just weird it's just strange to me
I will say the one thing that I'll say
is them
doing it in the only shower in the house
I wouldn't be that grossed out but I
could understand why
someone would be
because I'm like a rat is I wouldn't be
into it but I would be like yeah they
[ __ ] in the shower who cares like it's
self-cleaning it's like a it's like an
oven you know the shower cleans itself
every time you get in
but like if if someone was like if you
just do that can you clean the shower
afterwards I would be like yeah okay
that makes sense I can understand why
you would feel that way
they also might have just been showering
together which is true but the point is
that that's irrelevant it doesn't matter
if they're showering together or they're
in the shower together getting it on
that I respect the fact that they're a
couple they can do whatever they want
I will say maybe and this might make me
a bit of a prude that's about as far as
it goes though the the guest bed or the
shower
if I like went out to run an errand and
then like a second later I was like oh
actually I forgot my reusable bags and I
see that you're like bent over the
kitchen island or something like that
I'd be like that's disrespectful
I understand the appeal I suppose
there's a bit of a thrill but could you
well you're staying in my house could
you just do it in the in the bed or the
shower
I walk around the on the kitchen floor
Barefoot sometimes I don't want to step
in anything I just like
that's all I'm asking for okay I think
that's a reasonable standard but like in
the shower who cares
I know there's going to be a lot of like
moralizing in here that in the comments
that's like you don't you they're going
through an emotionally hard time right
now and that's true but like it's also
completely like irrelevant
like you should just not care even if
they're just like there for the weekend
to play some board games or something
like that why do you care
I think it's a plumbing issue there's no
way it's a plumbing issued like the
because then the husband would be like
it's a plumbing issue husbands love
talking about that kind of stuff it's a
plumbing issue
there you're wasting water somehow by
taking a shower that's as long as one
person's normal shower but getting two
people clean
I know the people are also going to be
like
oh your husband is is jealous he feels
threatened because he's not getting what
they have and he feels slighted look
that might be true but they also for all
I know the husband and wife might be
doing it all the time and he might just
be like kind of a freak that's like no I
don't pay a mortgage so other people can
[ __ ] in my house I pay a mortgage so
that I can [ __ ] up my house
so like I don't think you can infer that
the husband is like just
not getting any and he's like upset by
that I think he's just a the base case
here is that he's just a weird guy why
do you I just don't understand why do
you care
oh here we go
your husband came rushing in to tell you
that your sister and her husband took a
shower together this is so dumb you're
the [ __ ] get a life bro leave them
alone they're stressed enough as it is
so true
but yeah I had me until this edit that
says obligatory wow I didn't expect all
the updates and awards thank you thanks
more importantly
I was a bit a bit flippant in my
original comment so I want to use my
newfound Fame and Glory LOL to say
something to everyone saying your house
your rules what the heck is this it's a
viewer
or they need to get a hotel
that's all fine and good we're here to
give our opinions on the situation but
can we remember this couple just lost
their home they're in serious medical
debt they have a sick child the
likelihood of their marriage surviving
the immense stress and hardship they're
experiencing is statistically low I'm
I'm not a marriage counselor
I think if they're going through a very
stressful situation
they're staying in somebody else's house
and they're [ __ ] in the damn shower
they're doing fine it seems like they've
built an incredible Bond I don't think
you need to say the the likelihood of
their marriage surviving is
statistically low like that's like
serious Source I made it the hell up
it seems like like they got dealt a bad
hand but they're actually like their the
bond between husband and wife is doing
okay
can we get some compassion for these
people can you leave your personal
Hang-Ups and give behind and give them
some support can you find happiness
they're making time and effort to spend
together what's really important here
well like I agree but I hate the way you
you said
thanks for the updates
info unless they were loudly banging why
do you care there's nothing weird or
untowards by a shower a couple showering
together my husband and I often shower
together 99 of the time it's completely
non-sexual we find it to be a nice time
to chat without fear of interruption
from our kids dead ass you're you're a
freak that's one of the weirdest things
I've ever heard in my entire life
your shower in
non-intimentally with your spouse and
just having a conversation in the shower
that seems I look it's not my life it's
it's cute actually but it sounds [ __ ]
weird to me man I can't do that the
shower is my time
I can't be in the shower at talking
about how uh oh how was your day
yesterday meanwhile I'm
like lathering up my sensitive regions
and stuff like this I'm doing anything
that's not okay in there I would just be
it's a me problem I'm just I'd be very
uncomfortable
also I don't want to be like
when I'm in the shower like I want the
water
I work for a living I pay my mortgage I
pay my taxes when I'm in the shower I
want the water okay
again I'm not saying this is
it's weird to me but that it could be
because maybe I'm weird
but I will say if if Kate was like
do you want to take a shower together
and talk about our day I'd be like
why don't we why don't you take a shower
then when you get out we can have like
some tea and talk about our day or
something like that I don't want to I
don't want to talk about our day in the
shower it's just I don't know it just
seems like it's
but they're too non-related activities
I don't know it's just weird to me
it's just strange
you could do whatever you want to say in
your like at my house I don't care
if you if you were in my I genuinely I I
don't care in the slightest if you're in
my guest room and you're doing some
stuff like this doesn't bother me at all
just don't ask me to do it don't try to
convert me into one of those
non-sexual couples showering having a
casual conversation holding hands and
giving each other side hugs only spent
50 percent of the time when you're in
the shower in the water
come on
makes me sick
you're the [ __ ] as long as the shower
is clean when they're done which it will
be because it's self-cleaning
you shouldn't care I was in the kitchen
area this is a strange hang up for him
to have was he raised in an environment
with unhealthy views about sex and
intimacy
well yeah this story takes place in the
United States of America so I'm going to
guess that the answer is like probably
yes but we can't infer that from the
amount of
text in the original post
you're the [ __ ] and so is your
husband why is he so pressed about what
a married couple does what makes them
taking a shower together inappropriate
I don't even like the phrasing of the
like I don't like the word inappropriate
here
it's not inappropriate for
married adults to have sex
especially I mean you gotta it's weird
phrasing but like
especially when they're like part of
your family
not like in the help me step brother I'm
stuck sort of way but like
when they're when you have your
relatives and their spouses in your
house like that's
it's me mikasai sukasa it's not
inappropriate it's as appropriate as
almost anything could be
it's like the second most okay it's the
third most appropriate it's the fourth
most appropriate
you the first most appropriate is your
own house
second is probably a hotel third is
probably your card fourth is at your
relative's house
but still
yeah your car is more appropriate than
your relative's house
because it's your car your rules
I'm not saying it's more convenient I'm
just saying on a scale of like
you know there's some very we're not
going to go down to the depths there's
some inappropriate places for sure
but the car is is like no one no one
would be like am I the [ __ ] for
[ __ ] in my car people would be like
nah dude is your car do whatever you
want as long as like it's it's private
and there's at least a discussion here
if someone's like am I the [ __ ] for
having sex with my husband in my
sister's house some nut jobs would be
like yes it's their house
the car would be 100 not the [ __ ]
unless info is it a BMW anyway
or you're double parked
their child is ill their child is so ill
they've lost their home to cover his
treatment and you freak out because they
walked into the bathroom together you're
the [ __ ] doesn't even come close edit
thank you for all the upvotes and awards
yeah
oh man
your husband is upset because your grown
married sister might have been what
showering together or showering together
BB code either way that's kind of weird
especially if you felt the need to go
tattle to you about it does he expect
them not to sleep together too because
you might be shocked by the things that
happen in a bed they're going through a
rough time they need a bit of time
without you guys or the kid around and
unless there's enough rooms they don't
have to Bunk with the kid that's not
happening softer the [ __ ] for you
your husband's the [ __ ] for making a
big deal out of this 100 percent
I'm sorry for the Frog voice okay I'm
sorry for the Frog voice one moment
please one moment
I gotta mute as well I almost didn't
mute
is that better
chills chills
still it's not Steve gorgatron it's my
real voice yeah okay anyway
the sea Reed is always greener than
somebody else's lake
hold on I did want to see this
your house your rules in the bathroom is
a communal space so you're not wrong to
set this boundary however I also do
understand the need for privacy for a
little intimacy even if I've never
experienced it myself which I'm guessing
they aren't getting while staying in
your guest room if you feel
uncomfortable about them sharing a
shower maybe as a peace offering to your
sister you can ask if they'd like a few
hours of alone time together and you can
take your nephew out of the house to
spend time with you
this will show your sister that you care
about her feelings we're also keeping
your boundaries about the bathroom
actually you know what this is this is
stealth like a great point
because she's asking how far you're
willing to go for
your principles
if the choice is let them go shower
together
or all of a sudden I've got a
babysitting job
enjoy your shower
I got stuff to I'm not saying I wouldn't
help out when it was appropriate
but I think I would get over my hang up
very fast and I would if they were like
hey can you look after uh Billy for a
little bit so me and my husband can have
some alone time I would be like
enjoy your showers from this point
forward enjoy your showers one of the
finest negotiating Minds I've ever known
so that's why I think this comment is a
little genius it's because they're
basically they're they're King
solomoning it in my opinion at least
they're saying yeah and then if if the
husband is like yes and then the wife is
like no then I don't know they gotta cut
the shower in half or something I don't
know I gotta figure it out anyway I
think we're all pretty much on the same
page on this one
I do that I do hate how people say your
house your rules
that doesn't excuse you for being like
insane obviously like you can set
whatever rule you want in your house but
it doesn't make you like morally clean
for it
also like obviously it doesn't preclude
you from following like the letter of
the law but like you you could still be
like a [ __ ]
why don't you just own being a [ __ ]
it always has to be like hey I've got
like an ins I it might be a little
insane of me to have this uh clause for
behavior in my house can you uh wash my
hands of any moral culpability here
people got some complicated lives man
like am I the [ __ ] for canceling the
family vacation because my husband gave
our kids tickets to his widowed cousins
his widowed cousins kids am I the
[ __ ]
for canceling the family vacation
because my husband gave our kids tickets
to his widowed cousins kids
you you got to listen Okay Cicero has a
great quote a little hypocritical
considering his net worth according to
the internet at least Cicero said all a
man needs to be happy is a garden and a
library okay
am I the [ __ ] for canceling the
family vacation because my husband gave
our kids tickets to his widowed cousins
kids sister wrote If you showed this
post to Cicero his head would explode
he would suffer a cardiac a myocardial
infarction and pass away on the spot
there's just too much stuff going on in
the post you got to simplify your life
you gotta your life is a is a fraction
but you're not at the lowest common
denominator right now this is crazy
so my my cousin
I'm the oldest of my cousins
which you believe but it's hard for me
to believe because I had a November
birthday which means that in all of my
classes I was like the youngest or
second youngest but anyway long story
listen this is not relevant it's just my
own hang up I'm the oldest of my cousins
okay
we had our the rest of my cousins all
live in my hometown five hour flight
away
I live over here Coastal Elite
passing out Pearls of Wisdom why don't
you just drink some kombucha
Starbucks that's cute
um is there a JJ Bean around here anyway
we had our kid end of September 2020.
one of my cousins had her daughter
middle of October 2020. so she's like
two weeks younger than my daughter
everyone in the family keeps trying to
like organize this stuff to get them to
meet oh she's got him she's gotta meet
her second cousin she's gotta meet her
dad's
dads Brothers kids kid we gotta get them
to out to like an event so they we just
got to get a picture of them together
and finally I just said to my mom I was
like why
and then she she thought about it for a
second and she was like
you know what it's kind of like fair
enough like it's just because they're
like me and my cousin Are Family
and we both had kids at roughly the same
time but those kids are not family
unless they want to be
like your cousin at least in my family
your cousin is about as far out as you
go on the family tree
and my my cousin's child is part of
she's lumped in with my cousin as a unit
but as soon as that kid turns 18 they're
a stranger to me they just happen that's
just some lady now
if if the dominoes fell something
happened to my cousin and her husband
and like all of their family and somehow
was like Hey can you take care of her I
would be like of course she's family but
otherwise if she makes it 18 and they're
like oh you know Jennifer graduated from
high school today I'll be like who the
[ __ ] is Jennifer as of today I don't
know her
she's literally just
she's just a person she's she's an
unrelated individual I'm not getting
that they never say by the way we're
gonna come out to Vancouver
they never said you want to take a
picture how about you hop on a damn
plane
you come out here and come to our house
we'll take a photo and then you can
leave it's always you gotta come back so
that we could take a photo
it's a double standard man
anyway sorry sorry I'm mostly just
joking she's a very cute baby okay she's
very cute
am I the [ __ ] for not helping a child
when they fell over
I'm joking I'm joking
hold on let's see
you might be but it's still going to be
funny either way
what the hell is this subreddit
r slash hit manimals
revenge shot is this animals knocking
over kids r slash hitting animals
I do love America's Funniest Home Videos
when like a dog knocks over a toddler
it's a great subreddit okay all right
well just keep that in mind
am I the [ __ ] for not helping a child
when they fell over
today I was waiting for my girlfriend at
our local park I was waiting on a bench
looking at ducks in the pond when a
child right in front of me fell off of
his scooter he's probably six I laughed
not out loud
what
the child was crying being dramatic when
its mother came rushing in to check if
he's bleeding he was not he wasn't even
scratched
the woman looked up to me seeing me
slightly grin asking why I didn't help
him I responded he isn't hurt so why do
I need to help him she got pissy and
said if he was bleeding from his head
would you help I said no probably not
she started having a go with me acting
like I should have helped a random
dramatic child up from the floor when he
wasn't even injured I walked away and
from a distance you could hear her
yelling I can't tell if I was in the
[ __ ] or I was because he and my kid
he ain't my responsibility listen the
you're like the way you're writing the
post makes you like an [ __ ]
but like you're not the [ __ ] in the
sense that like
there was no reason for you to help the
kid
like when my kid falls over at the
playground I don't expect any other
parent to like
pick them up
even like their parents similarly when
I'm at the park with my kid and I see a
kid fall down I don't pick up the other
kid I'm like your parents are here
it's just not my place the only reason
you're like kind of an [ __ ] is
because you keep
I mean you're kind of like doubling down
every single time someone's like could
you have a little empathy you're like no
I refuse so it's weird because you're
like you're in the right to have not
helped the kid
which sounds like a bit of an [ __ ]
thing to say but as long as their
parents are there
like if a six-year-old kid's riding a
scooter and then they'd brick it right
in front of you and they're bleeding or
something and then you look around and
their parents aren't there sorry you
just inherited like a bad situation
if you're in that kid's line of sight
you got to help them
because otherwise he's going to be like
this guy didn't help me and then you
yeah they're good people are going to
get their pitchforks and their torches
and stuff like that but
until I had a kid I basically did not I
was just annoyed by children in public
for sure
I don't think this guy did anything
wrong except though he was kind of a
[ __ ] with the way he interacted with
the mom like before we had our kid if
there was sometimes kids in public would
just like talk to you
they'll be like
and you're like
oh yeah
and then you just like walk away now I'm
like whoa POG really
and they're like yeah look at my
dinosaur and I'm like wow
what kind of dinosaur is that
and then they go above asaurus and I go
with the bulbasaurus
but I don't expect like someone without
a kid to
to act like that like that's that if you
act like that and you don't have a child
you're like clinically insane or you
have like a sibling that has a kid or
you're good with kids or whatever but
it takes time to learn how to interact
with a child you can't just be like oh I
was one I know how to do it
you forget about it man
I just don't know why this guy like I'm
I have to say I have to stick to my
principles he didn't do anything wrong
it seems like the mom look I'm not
projecting but I guess inferring
I feel like the mom
was in an emotional state because her
kid got hurt and she said some stuff
that crossed the line like hey stranger
why didn't you touch my child when they
fell over which is like batshit crazy
and then he was probably like why is
this lady getting on my case I didn't
buy her kid the scooter so he's just out
trying to look he's fishing for like an
own but he's not in the wrong in any
aspect here
the only reason he's in the wrong is
because it the reason he would would be
the [ __ ] is not for not helping the
kid it's for
not like I don't know
fake apologizing or pretending to have
some concern
like he
is clearly very impressed with himself
that he didn't help this kid and stuck
to his guns despite someone asking why
he couldn't have some empathy but I
don't think he's the [ __ ] at all for
not helping a kid when they fell over
if anything he would be like more of an
[ __ ] if he didn't help an adult if
they fell over
like if you're sitting on a park bench
and like somebody crumbles to the ground
in front of you and they're like 35 I
think you have an obligation as a member
of like the human race to be like are
you okay do you need me to call a doctor
like are you having a heart attack but
if it's a kid that's like you know
there's a caretaker there at least there
should be a caretaker around
um
like it's it's not that it's not your
responsibility so you get to like not do
anything it's a it's not your
responsibility you shouldn't do
something
that's what the parents the parents want
to do it and they don't want a stranger
to do it or at least they shouldn't
anyway
I don't understand what he's saying yeah
what he says I laughed but not out loud
but anyway
although to be honest I don't if someone
was walking by me and they fell over I
would have real concern I would perform
CPR whether they wanted it or not but if
someone was on one of those like
uni-wheel electric scooters and they
bricked it in front of me and slid like
a meter on the sidewalk
I would I would probably just turn to
the other direction and be like
it finally happened
it finally I knew is it I see you with
these [ __ ] every day riding
those uh those weird una Wheels they've
always got full like motorcycle Leathers
on but they got their hands in their
pockets I'm just waiting for the day
when I'm they're just going Z and they
hit a rock and they're like oh
foreign
something like that with your hands in
your pockets man
I tell you I'm sure I have but I tell
you one time I was just sitting on our
uh patio
just minding my own business and then
one of those uh bikes that had a trailer
on the back that uh like a toddler can
sit in it's like a covered little tent
with wheels on it so you can bike but
your kid is in the back uh being towed
along
and they were they were riding and then
they'd signaled and then they turned
left but they turned left way too fast
or way too sharply so the trailer on the
back jackknifed and then the tent like
slid along the road into the bike lane
with the kid in it
everybody everybody was like oh my God
and then the dad was like really freaked
out but he just got out and like put the
trailer up on his side and then was like
are you okay and the kid was like yeah
yeah I'm okay I'm okay
uh
anyway
did you laugh once I knew the kid was
okay absolutely like the first the
moment of it was like very scary
as soon as the kid was like I'm fine I
was like yeah that's just hilarious
that kid probably thought it was wicked
you're absolutely right
all right let me go check out the
comments
you wouldn't necessarily be an [ __ ]
for not helping but you're the [ __ ]
for your whole attitude I agree with a
redditor
it's true
you're the [ __ ] for laughing at an
injured kid and grinning at this
spectacle who does that lots of people
you can still be a good person and and
harbor a Dark Passenger within your
within your brain
calm down Edge Lord You're the [ __ ]
but like listen he didn't do anything
plus you have a hexagonal Avatar he
didn't do anything
you're the [ __ ] to bare minimum when
you see anyone fall right in front of
you is to ask are you okay listen it's
not the bare minimum the bare minimum is
to do nothing but like sure it would
have he could have been nicer but having
space having niceness capacity above
your
actual Behavior does not make you an
[ __ ]
you definitely shouldn't touch the child
but it would be nice to say where's your
grown-up do you want me to get their
attention this is not in the this is not
something that happens in the real world
this is why we can't have like an AI
driven court system
no way dude if my kid bricked it in
front of somebody and they said do you
want me to get your grown up I would be
like I'm right here
going somewhere jeric
that being said I would also be right
there
real voice reveal thought I was what
dead like my partner you just threw off
the cliff
yes you're the [ __ ] normal humans
react when a child hurt themselves get
up and ask the kid if he's okay I don't
know if this is something that is
actually like I I think parenting has
actually put me on the side of the child
list here in a weird way
because I'm like dude my kids too
when a six-year-old falls down in front
of me I'm like get up and go to work
you're old I'm just like obviously
that's insane
six-year-olds are in like what like
kindergarten maybe the first grade
but I'm hanging out with like a
two-year-old I'm taking her to parks
where she plays with like other
two-year-olds they fall down they don't
know what to do right they fall down
they're like ah what's going on a kid
was mean to me you gotta like you know
build the scaffolding of what the real
world is like when a six-year-old Falls
over I'm like
and
like if you're hurt sure but like
they they at least have the cave I'm not
saying they don't need to be supervised
I'm just saying like they have the
faculties to be like am I okay yes okay
I'm gonna get on my my scooter and go
away
no they don't they're six
I'm telling you I think it's just
because the because I have a
two-year-old six-year-olds look old to
me
like they they uh when I see a
six-year-old at the park I'm like oh
[ __ ] watch out
I don't wanna I don't want to get on
that guy's bad side whoa hold on
[Laughter]
and I see other adults I'm like we're
the same size that's fine I look at my
kid and I look at like a kid that's in
the second grade I'm like oh Jesus
jumping Mary and Joseph who brought the
beefcake
this kid is like eight feet tall what
the hell
this kid's wearing pants with a fly
what are you like a hundred years old
he said the thing
I just genuinely I you look
so much of my banter in the last two
years is like you guys wouldn't
understand unless you like have a child
this one I'm like I it's the first time
I can extend an olive branch to the r
slash anti-natalist community
I I don't think they did anything wrong
I think everyone else is being
needlessly self-righteous
also like kids fall down like all the
time
like it's actually like the least big
deal of all time the first time my kid
fell down it was a nightmare
I was like this is a disaster
she's probably gonna have a concussion
we can't let her go to sleep tonight
she's gonna have a permanent brain
injury after like two or three of them
they take some like Grievous injuries we
were walking with our kid one day
um she was like I don't want to hold
your hand we said okay be careful
immediately tripped on an uneven
sidewalk tile
Splat got up
like blood in her mouth she didn't crack
a tooth or anything like that but she
bit her lip leg on the way down blood
like like sputtering out of her mouth
all over her shirt all over my shirt
and I was like oh my God this is crazy
he pulled out some tissues dabbed it I
was like are you okay she's like no we
walked like half a block
I was like are you okay she's like yeah
Daddy I want to walk like it's kids are
built different man
I bit my lip this is true by the way I
bit my lip eating a piece of pizza too
fast on Tuesday and it's not only not
getting better the wound is still
getting worse
it's not bad but it like the wound
hasn't even peaked yet much less started
to regress
it's crazy
like like a kid falling down
you kind of have to know like you gotta
there's there's
Radiance of it
if a kid just is sort of like you know
they're on their scooter they brick it a
little bit they're gonna be fine
if they hit their head on like the
corner of a cobblestone or something
like that and they get up in there all
dazed and stuff like that then you're
like okay are you oh my God are you okay
that looked terrible
the kid just kind of like you know
crashes down onto the sidewalk and goes
like oof
oof is like little kid version of like
that wasn't a big deal at all
okay
you know like and this is not this is a
secondhand story a podcast I listen to
one of the podcasters has like a
five-year-old
the kids were running around on the
playground two of them crashed into each
other head on
the kid said Dad I think I broke my leg
and the dad didn't believe him which by
the way I completely
understand
I think people without kids would be
like how could you not believe your
five-year-old when they say something
like that as an adult with a toddler I'm
like how does how does this kid know
what a broken leg feels like anyway so
long story short he did break his uh
tibia but I could completely understand
the parents position that was like
I that at least is like let's go home
and put some ice on it and see if you
feel better before we go to the ER
anyway
moving on
I broke my arm as a kid my mom didn't
believe me at first
well you know I'm sure you don't want to
believe it for one reason one reason is
like
you know
kids are just wrong a lot of the time
and another reason is that it's gonna
like [ __ ] up your whole life like it's
definitely gonna [ __ ] up your night to
go to the ER
especially in the modern era but then
like you're like I don't want to believe
that my kid's going to be in a cast for
like the next six weeks
I'm gonna have to like go back to giving
them a bath like they're a little baby
again
it's very inconvenient say as as Al Gore
said it's An Inconvenient Truth
am I the [ __ ] for telling my husband
he can go on a trip with his sister on
his own
if he wants to cancel our trip to join
theirs I apologize for the for the burp
by the way
my mistake I apologize
huh
this feels like yet another



I'm willing to blow up my marriage over
nothing sort of joke here
am I the [ __ ] for telling my husband
he can go on a trip with his sister on
his own if he wants to cancel our trip
to join theirs
me and my husband have been married for
a year
that's cute
Rick's niece Anna is terminal
that means terminally ill right
okay yes
well then you're the [ __ ] I'm sorry
[Laughter]
there's no I don't even need to read it
the the rest of it like obviously like
if if there's a 50 50 decision and the
other person is literally going to die
you're in the wrong
if it's like 99 1 and they're dying you
can be in the right but if it's 50 50
like
if it's even close you gotta go with
them on that one
we're planning to go to France early
next year we've already decided on
flights Hotel
Etc nothing's been booked yet we've
already decided we haven't made any dude
we haven't uh made any commitments or
anything like that but we've already got
it all planned out and decided no
commitments that we're unable to break
or anything like that
nothing set in stone except in my brain
nothing has been booked yet though
because of what Rick wants and this is
causing issues between us my
sister-in-law
Anna's mom and her family are going to
Fairbanks around that time because Anna
wants to try to see the Northern Lights
sister-in-law asked if we want to join
them and in Rick's words we can go to
France another time I said no I
understand him but we pretty much
planned out our France trip Rick is
insisting that he needs to go I got a
little upset and replied he can go if he
wants but I won't be joining him and
I'll go to France with my family instead
he's been soaking in his mad at me I
think he's the one being unreasonable
here am I the [ __ ] yes obviously
there's like a 90 chance France will
still be there in like 2026 okay
I hope this is a fake post I don't even
wanna it just makes me feel bad to like
get into it okay
just this just you could still have fun
in Fairbanks Alaska probably
I wouldn't know personally but
this is you've got to be at least a
little bit reasonable in this one this
is crazy man
Ketchikan that's obviously that's the
Jewel of the Northwest but Fairbanks I'm
sure Fairbanks is fine anyway
I'm not I'm not reading the comments so
now and everyone knows what that one's
gonna say
am I the [ __ ] for not letting her
boyfriend sleep over okay all right
let's see this has got it's it's uh
intimacy uh your house your rules etc
etc
it's got everything
on mobile and throwaway because my
daughter uses Reddit well there's your
first red flag are you sure that her
boyfriend is real
sorry sorry
that was beneath me it was just it was
just a witty little loan okay
my 50 my I am 50 my daughter is in
college and stays at her boyfriend's a
lot which me and my wife do not like
very much okay tough we let her do what
she wants nonetheless
she pays for her own tuition and works
plus pays for all of her own things
minus we pay for rent we have a room for
her and she does live with us why are
you why are you writing like this
where did you learn how to write
sentences you got the main idea at the
back end of the sentence and all the
mitigating circumstances at the front
like a psycho
this [ __ ] is hard to read
it's driving me crazy
she asked if her boyfriend could come
sleep over too so she could feel more
comfortable staying at home more often
we said absolutely not she was upset
because she said it was her own room and
that she's been dating him for almost
three years we just will not allow it
under our roof and she threatened to
move in with him we really want her to
continue living here but do not want
them sleeping together under our roof we
do not like it with her there either but
she's an adult we have a pretty good
relationship so this has been hard for
us am I the [ __ ] yeah you're crazy
what's the
I I don't understand listen
here's what I'm going to say
I can understand at the very least
having negative feelings about the fact
that the child that you raised is now
old enough to have sleepovers with her
boyfriend okay
the problem you have is thinking that
the way that you deal with the negative
emotion in that case is to
do something about this stimulus that
led you to feeling the negative emotions
instead of looking within yourself
at what's causing those negative
emotions and learning how to deal with
it you you're a 50 year old man when a
situation comes like this comes up like
this and you're like I feel bad I need
to do something about the thing in the
real world that's making me feel bad you
gotta you gotta progress past that
sometimes yes I feel hungry I'll eat
some food I feel sleepy I'm going to
take a snooze but if you're like someone
is doing something that's well within
their own rights
um
and they're my child so even though
sometimes I have to like uh you know
support them even though it wouldn't be
something that I would do for myself
that's when you got to look within
yourself and be like well oh my
daughter's pissing me off so much with
her behavior why is her completely
normal behavior pissing me off so you
just gotta suck it up you gotta bend
still to it I'm sorry
why is this man talking and not reading
the edits because I'm making a good
point everybody else is just like read
the answers
read the edits he's crazy I'm trying to
have the slightest shred of sympathy for
this man at the very least
dude dude skip the third act get to the
part where gulp Shadow shows up in the
mid-credits scene
dude I don't care okay like dude he
kills the bad guy who's like just like
himself but in a different colored suit
dude okay whatever get to the part where
Adam Warlock pops out of the cryo
chamber so I can go on r slash uh Marvel
Studios and be like what does this mean
bro my dream cast for Adam Warlock oh
call me crazy I'm gonna say is Adam
Driver
anyway I'm just saying I mean this is
there's like a lesson in this for me I'm
not a perfect human being but
sometimes when you feel negative
emotions is because something is [ __ ]
up and you got to fix it but sometimes
the thing that's [ __ ] up is the way
you're looking at the situation like if
your kid is in their 20s and they're an
adult and they're doing adult things and
you feel bad the secret is not to put
them under lock and key the secret is to
be like
I don't know take up golf or something
like you're in your 50s you got to find
something to take your mind off it
because they're doing that's what adults
do
anyway so am I the [ __ ] my wife and I
discussed it a bit and we're currently
thinking we could put an air mattress
next to her bed if they leave the door a
bit cracked I understand where the
[ __ ] is just hard changing our
beliefs we love her and she has been
really disconnecting from us and not
coming around at all well that's like
you know I mean
that's just what happens when it so they
become an adult
you know I don't know if everybody's on
the same page here but definitely like
my relationship with my parents you know
they're like you're you spend like 90 of
your time with them when you're like a
child and then as a teenager you start
to spend like like less and less but
still a lot and then I went to college
and I was like it cratered
I saw them you know now and then
but at the same time
early 20s still like very low
I was like you know defining myself as
an adult and then in my you know mid-20s
when I when I was like I'm an adult now
we've started spending more time
together and then you know it's going to
continue to rise up to some point
the early 20s
pardon me
it's uh you know they're making their
own their way in the world
I don't under I don't understand the
problem I also think it's how naive are
you
to think that an air mattress and a
cracked door is gonna resolve what's
like why don't you just say it you don't
want your daughter having sex with her
boyfriend even though they're both
adults you don't want it to happen to
begin with which I think is by the way
not an atypical thing to not want
but you also have to acknowledge at some
point that you're like okay at this
point I'm the [ __ ] about it you can
still have the [ __ ] feeling but you
could be like
it's that's a good way to describe it
it's crazy but it is a little
understandable but like come on you're
not gonna
the air mattress and the crack door is
not going to stop you like what do you
think is that's going to accomplish
you're just
by trying to keep your daughter close
you're pushing her away I hate to put it
in the Hallmark
Lifetime movie sort of way but it's it's
the core of the issue the way I see it
at least
edit our son already moved out into an
apartment with his girlfriend he does
not come around often
edit my daughter texted she found the
post I will do an update once we talk
edit we spoke she says she's going to
stay with her boyfriend more and we'll
try to move out of the end of the
semester we said he could sleep on the
floor or couch but not her bed she said
she understood and left we are not on
bad terms she explained her point of
view but we are not willing to
compromise that far thank you all for
the words of advice this is like
I think this is fake
maybe they're all fake but like
I feel like this I I just don't see a 50
year old man writing this post and then
coming back and saying edit my daughter
texted she found the post I will do an
update once we talk
I don't see someone writing this line
like I don't I don't see the person who
they claim to be writing this line I do
see someone in OverWatch queue writing
this line and then playing three ranked
games and then coming back and writing
the last part of the edit
that's that's my conspiracy theory here
but like this is I this is the kind of
post that pisses me off a little bit
because like it's on why are we
obviously if this is real you're the
[ __ ] you don't have a leg to stand on
there's not even any point to
to the discussion there's no gray area
this reeks of Boomer that's why you have
to be skeptical of things that confirm
the biases that you hold
if you're saying something like no I
could totally see someone doing this
you've got to look within yourself and
figure out why it is that you're not
applying the same level of scrutiny to
this post because of your ageism that
you apply to every other post on the
website and the animals are leaving in
the
um
anyway
we'll find another one
we find a fake one that looks real
please
am I the [ __ ] for
threatening to leave my daughter's
wedding because of her rules
and he has over threatening to leave my
daughter's wedding because of her rules
similar to this post
our slash conservative Usual Suspects
cry foul as GOP make Squad the focus of
dot dot dot okay
thanks read it I appreciate the
based on your browsing history
Minnesota
my 48 male daughters 26f wedding was
yesterday she moved back to our home
state of Utah with her fiance after
living in Boston for college and dental
school she does not seem happy to be
back here and she only moved back
because her husband's company
transferred him here okay
she knows that in our family families
run large honestly seems like a great
place to open a dental practice
I think you're not the [ __ ] she's not
seeing the big picture here
High earning families with an average of
eight kids per household
that is a that is a beautiful place to
open a dental office that shares a
location with the Chuck E cheese
I'm just I'm looking at it from a
business case here okay
when she started planning her wedding
wait okay sorry she is one of three kids
only because my wife became sick after
our youngest but it is not uncommon to
have families of eight when she started
planning her wedding she started
worrying about venue capacity and having
to spend money on babysitters for
couples with small kids on her list she
made it clear she could not she could
not accommodate kids four and under at
this wedding I'm just gonna go ahead and
say it most of these posts that say like
you can't bring young kids to the
wedding I'm like that's unreasonable and
selfish there might be an asterisk
that says except in cases of Utah
I didn't consider the edge case
if everybody in your family also has
like six kids of their own on average
then I could understand being like we
gotta do something
if you got like two kids
and your sisters like they can't come to
the wedding
that's like too far but if you're like
if your cousin is like hey do you we
need a whole table just for me my kids
and my husband then I'm like you know
what I could understand writing like a
no kids Clause into your into your
wedding
that seems like a lot
also like and this sound I mean I don't
live in Utah okay
but when you have six kids and your mom
had six kids
and and your your grandparents had six
kids don't you have like 27 aunts or
something like that
doesn't just like one Aunt look after 40
kids for that day
they all get like one hard-boiled egg
for lunch and a slice of bread and then
like I it takes a village to raise a
child
but in this case doesn't it just take
one adult to handle the village while
the wedding's going I thought you had
like a support system
my parents live a five-hour flight away
we're handling all this [ __ ] ourselves
I feel like if I had like eight aunts I
would be like uh pardon me
I'm feeling a little under the weather
today Aunt Sally could you come over and
watch the baby for a bit oh and uh oh
sorry Aunt Sally's busy uh Aunt uh and
Judy could you come over and watch the
baby for a bit hey could we uh oh uh
Aunt uh Jennifer could I come could I
drive the baby over there I'm not
feeling well today
etc etc like
isn't the isn't that what they're there
for
I thought that was like the great thing
about having a big family
is that there's like something there's
like a virus in the human brain
where when you're like I can't deal with
this kid for like another five minutes
there
Aunt Grandma
etc etc is like I want nothing more in
my life than to look at this child and
smother them with affection right now
foreign
so true
they're like I was made for this
anyway still still going
um kids under four can't come to the
wedding okay fair enough
this caused a lot of iron we got phone
calls asking why my daughter's rationale
which she thought older kids would enjoy
a party more
my daughter's younger sister Ashley has
been married for two years and begged
her sister to an my daughters younger
sister Ashley
who is also your daughter
has been married for two years and
begged her sister
to invite her husband's brother and his
wife to the wedding too
Ashley's brother-in-law and his wife
have five kids four of which always lie
and one of which always tells the truth
four of whom are under the age of four
it's your life
when they are svp'd they indicated
they'd only be bringing their
eight-year-old daughter I know Ashley's
husband's brother well as he funded my
brother's new business and employs
Ashley's husband my son-in-law in a job
that allows Ashley and him to be
full-time parents to their kids what the
[ __ ] is happening here
your brother-in-law is also
his brother's boss
and also was the investor in your this
is like Fargo man
there's too much it's all wrapped up in
its it's it's melting down
however that side of the family took a
while to warm up to Ashley as they are
wary to newcomers so the day of the
wedding comes and everybody arrives with
the kids they rsvp'd for and then
Ashley's brother-in-law arrives early
with all five of their kids The Nanny
they have for their kids is not there my
daughter is angry when she hears of this
the explanation is that their younger
kids were upset and they wanted to be in
the wedding photos too an argument
ensues where my daughter says they had
on-call nannies
and just for whatever reason decided
this was the event they didn't want to
leave their kids for
on-call nannies
you could do that
you get Uber a nanny
on called Yanni's
some on-call Laurels Maybe
I look over Ashley is getting upset
Ashley's getting upset
the brother-in-law and sister-in-law
won't budge the toddlers are getting
anxious and starting to loudly cry I
finally tell my daughter just to let
them in or we'd be here forever she
asked why I was taking their side I
finally say that she either lifts this
child-free policy for family or just
canceled the wedding because I'm done
with her rules and leaving
my daughter says really Dad way to take
sides she then stormed off and there was
a minute where she considered walking
down the aisle with her future
father-in-law she ended up relenting but
says her wedding is marred by this event
am I the [ __ ] I was afraid this would
become the standoff and Ashley would
face Iyer from her in-laws
got a couple of different things here
okay
first one is you're the [ __ ] because
your life is too complicated
and I'm sure that you're probably doing
some self-reflection on that right now
your life is too complicated you're you
got too many kids and cousins and
sisters and brothers and all of their
they're not just relatives they're
they're all wrapped up in your personal
businesses and and the fairs and stuff
like that
you have too much
coupling and not enough cohesion okay
you need the
you need to refactor your life a little
bit
why is our conservative similar to this
post probably because AI is bad and they
say the word Utah in the op I think
that's the main reason that this is
drawing the the the two halves together
here
that's my reverse engineering
I don't really like you can have eight
kids if you want to have eight kids like
that doesn't really bother me
it's not a life I would choose for
myself but if you're like am I the
[ __ ] because my family life's really
complicated I'm like
what'd you expect
I have seven brothers and sisters every
single one of them has six kids as well
am I the [ __ ] for like not keeping
their names straight I'm like well you
better get a [ __ ] dossier dude it's
the life you chose for yourself
thank you
I don't even know how to like
like it it is just like a Robert Altman
film there's too many characters man I
don't know
how to
tease this apart what I do know is you
if this story is real you should not
have
taken
anybody but your daughter's side on the
day of her wedding for having what
appears to be a fairly reasonable Clause
that was violated if you're going to
violate a clause you got to give
advanced notice you can't just spring it
on him and then ask for permission that
that's the [ __ ] move so like the the
core of the issue is yes you're the
[ __ ] because you got like I don't
know you're a people pleaser and it's
even though it's your daughter's special
day and she made a reasonable request
you're like why can't we all just get
along anyway
but like it's more like
man
I hate kids I know the dad only has
three
he only has more than average
four kids under four
like
I just want to say like rip to you
my brother
that's crazy also like a rip to your
wife for sure
I mean like that is
I'm sure there's people in that
situation in this chat which is again is
fine it's your life
but man
four in four years
it takes like point eight years just to
make one
and you did four in four years
they were all singles too
there wasn't any any two-piece combos in
there
twins basil
wrong 9 out of 12 is 0.75 hey guess what
world's uh smartest redditor
the average uh gestation period is
actually 40 weeks
can I get a 40 divided by 52 check real
quick
it's actually going to end up being like
0.78 please don't be 0.77 that means
they're right
please please 0.78 0.769 son of a [ __ ]
all right you you win this one
you win this I'm not reading the rest of
this it's just annoying
I'm mad at you for having such a large
family and that's not fair I need to
examine Within Myself
why that makes me so mad it's not
jealousy
and it's not sympathy I don't know it's
a different emotion
I'm still trying to figure it out
it is fair they're destroying the Earth
not really though like
listen
if you're going to be mad at someone
with eight kids for taking up too many
resources don't take hour-long showers
just because you like the way the water
feels okay don't close your eyes and sit
down in the shower I'm not gonna judge
anybody on an environmental level for
having children okay
I don't know maybe maybe they live off
of the land
maybe their carbon footprint is lower
than mine when you got eight kids you're
not taking too many like trans-pacific
flights this [ __ ] would be like a
hundred thousand dollars
mostly just sitting at home you're
driving you're when you have eight kids
you carpool every day
if they have an electric vehicle they
probably have like a smaller footprint
than I do okay I'm just annoyed that
like
I don't know I'm annoyed I guess that
the that the dad strikes me as naive and
he's like hey my family is huge and it's
causing problems and I'm like yeah
obviously
the more people you add into an
ecosystem the more likely there's going
to be some conflict
if you didn't want to fight so much you
shouldn't that you should have thought
of that before you had like [ __ ] 12
kids
but that's my own
it's my own cross to bear okay that's my
own cross to bear if they drive
um a GMC Suburban then yes you're the
[ __ ] but not as much of an [ __ ] as
somebody who drives a GMC Suburban but
is like just them and their spouse
and then they're like where do I park
yeah you [ __ ] park anywhere as long
as you don't own a GMC Suburban that's
like uh [ __ ] 45 feet long for no
reason
you got to go park in one of those like
side parking spots that they reserved
for school buses
sorry sorry
it's like he's carpilled he's carpilled
am I the [ __ ] for making my wife walk
to her 200 foot to her if you ever had a
dream that you that you wanted you to do
used so bad you could do anything am I
in the [ __ ] for making my wife walk
to her 200 foot to her parking spot
look at these edits man we live in a
townhouse with one garage parking spot I
park my Eevee in the garage so I can
charge it overnight and keep it out of
the elements there are guest parking
spots right next to the garage but when
those are unavailable I request that my
wife Parks her car a beat up 2006 Prius
on the street which is 200 feet from the
garage down an asphalt driveway she
leaves for work at 6am well I don't work
until 8 A.M am I the [ __ ] for not
letting her park in the garage yes
I'm I'm also I'm trying to figure out
the
I'm trying to figure out the the
kinematics of the situation you have a
townhouse
that's separated from the street by a
200 foot driveway
like what's the
what's the driveway doing
you know what I mean like why is why is
the driveway there
is just chilling
but I mean like what's it wait 200 foot
long driveway look it's not insanely
long but I would expect that that means
that there's like a palatial estate on
the other end maybe there's like a huge
fountain in the lawn or something like
that
edit seven explains this oh thank you
thank you the driveway is shared amongst
my neighbors and no one is allowed to
park there no this doesn't it doesn't
explain it I'm trying to picture in my
house or in my head how this works so
I've put a townhouse
so there's like I don't know there's a
complex maybe there's like eight little
townhouses closely in the same area then
there's a 200 foot driveway
that goes from the garage near the
townhouses 200 feet a 70 meter long
driveway
hey green Erv thanks for the gifted
subscriptions by the way
oh no okay now you got me thinking about
about East Vancouver okay
you're driving you turn right there's an
alley that could be 200 feet long if you
lived on one end of it I guess and you
parked on the other and then there's
garages that line the side of the alley
that are in the vicinity of the
townhouses okay I can picture that at
least
I'm solely Financial response
financially responsible for both cars
I this is the last this is how you know
you've lost the argument no disrespect
I know how that sounds but as soon as
you're like I'm my bad behavior might be
justified by the fact that I paid for
this like that is how you you don't have
a leg to stand on especially when that's
edit number one hey Corp slime thank you
for the gifted subscriptions as well
thank you
thank you my wife has broken the side
mirror and scraped the Prius backing out
of the garage on two separate occasions
okay
number one don't care number two like no
offense accidents happen she's driving a
car from 2006. I'm not gonna say she's
been driving every like 16 years but
like at the same time
this is like this is not unreasonable
Bay Area so lows are still in the low
50s
safe neighborhood with well-lit streets
and sidewalks she agreed to the parking
Arrangement before the car was ordered
I'm not trying to flex nor being a Tesla
bro I figured you all wanted more
specificity
the driveway is shared amongst my
neighbors and no one is allowed to park
there yeah you don't park on a driveway
a shared driveway at least you don't I
was like Devin you heard the Jerry
Seinfeld joke
what's next we're gonna drive on a
Parkway
I've driven the Prius for 11 years
before passing it on to my wife who
drove an even crappier 90s car she
sentimentally attached to the Prius and
won't trade it in until it kicks the can
what the [ __ ] is the problem with the
nobody's mad she's driving a Prius
what's the problem
I don't understand the issue
nobody's saying buy your wife a car that
doesn't have to be parked I mean what do
you
I refer to the Prius as beat up because
it has dense chipping paint on the roof
and hood and paint transfer from
previous run-ins I walk her out to her
car when the distance is not within view
of our bedroom her commute is 10 minutes
in her streets versus my 40-minute
Highway commute
this [ __ ] is like irrelevant
I don't understand like the
I don't understand like the problem
I believe this is a real post though
just due to like the insane way that
it's written I actually listen I don't
think he's like that much of an [ __ ]
it's just like a weird thing to go to
the internet to try to fix
or to try to get their verdict on like I
understand listen the EV has to be
charged with an 80-minute commute
surely it doesn't have to be charged
every day right
there's no way that it's not like a cell
phone from 1993
isn't that like an every other day sort
of thing
every three days or something like that
it just can't be no it can't be right
it doesn't pass the the the the smell
test
so you're telling me if he had like a 90
minute commute he would not be able to
he would have to swap batteries halfway
through
it doesn't make sense people are going
on like road trips I get they have to
charge like through the road trip
but at the same time like it doesn't it
just doesn't seem right to me
you don't want to run it down to zero
yeah but you don't have to keep it at
like you know a hundred
all these things have ranges of like you
know
like 400 kilometers or something like
that
depends okay well just give me a yes or
no
that's too complicated for me either way
like it doesn't matter that much I guess
here's the thing I think he's kind of
the [ __ ] for the way that he phrased
it saying he's making his wife walk 200
feet he's not really making his wife
walk 200 feet it's like the
circumstances making the making the wife
walk 200 feet
I think she should maybe like chill out
about it I just don't his desire to
breathlessly defend himself and be like
uh I I'm not doing anything wrong is
weird to me like isn't this a situation
where maybe like your wife is like I
wish I didn't have to walk so far to get
to my car and rather than present her
with 11 bullet points of why it's not
your fault you just say yeah I know it
does suck sorry like you just show like
some sympathy instead
I think it is what it is I also I mean I
I do think that like
you know why can't he drive the Prius
some days and her drive the
what we have to assume here is a Tesla
some days and they I mean they could
alternate if you're if you're
100 concerned about like fairness then
you could alternate
but it seems like the only way that he's
concerned about fairness is because he
wrote the contract up and she signed it
before they bought the car
and nothing is more fair than tort law
because she's attached to the car it's
fair then well honestly like I hate to
say it because I don't like the I don't
like this guy from his post but like at
the same time
sounds like she should just kind of suck
it up then
if she's sentimentally attached to the
Prius and then
his Tesla needs to be charged every
night in order to make it which I don't
buy for the record but if we're assuming
that that's real and it has to be
charged every night uh in order to
actually allow him to get to and from
work the next day then like welcome to
life
sometimes you want to eat like you know
chicken fingers and fries for dinner
every night but you're like I should
have some green leafy vegetables so I
don't die in my 40s like you just they
did sometimes you got circumstances
dictate you got to do some stuff that
you don't necessarily want to do
foreign
everybody sucks here what in the
American is this
first of all it seems like your car is
more important to you than your wife
which makes you the [ __ ] but I can't
understand how anyone would bother to
complain about walking 200 feet the
entire thing being such an issue you
feel they need to post it on the
Internet is astounding to me
I agree one of the finest legal Minds
I've ever known
you're the [ __ ] for being an annoying
Tesla bro
first thing I thought of too instead of
using my vehicle he says it's my Tesla
Model why did he edit that out of the
post originally
I was on his side until I maybe there
was a stealth edit there
if I wasn't 100 sure from the post
your defensiveness in the comments and
inability to take criticism makes me
think you're the [ __ ]
if you want to brag about owning a Tesla
try a car related subreddit instead of
inventing a story to post on am I the
[ __ ] it's it's a model why
is he bragging
that's the
that's the Lesser priced of the two SUV
skus yeah we had a roadster from like
2011 or whatever I would be like that's
rare I'm driving past Tesla Model wise
like uh 15 20 times a day just on the
way to daycare
you live in Vancouver though yeah I know
so what
I'm not saying it's a cheap car I'm just
saying like
is he really out here trying to brag
about owning
the less expensive Tesla SUV
when he lives in the Bay Area you pieces
of crap
you princess of Maine you Kings of New
England he's the one who they don't give
me this you don't understand life you
live in Vancouver this guy lives in the
damn bay area
it's where the ship was like invented
you're the [ __ ] I assume since your
wife goes to work at 6am she's the first
one home as well so you expect her to
ignore the empty garage and park on the
street so you can park your precious
Tesla out of the elements it would be
one thing if you needed it to charge but
it shouldn't be an every night thing you
just expecting that you automatically
get the garage because you drive a Tesla
makes you the [ __ ] okay
this fair enough
California the elements you're the
[ __ ] get a rain cover
it's good
this is too far though you're the
[ __ ] bragging about your car all the
while talking crap about your wife's car
start saving for the divorce now because
you're gonna need it listen you don't
know she could be as [ __ ] up as he is
people are all they always read these
one-sided posts and they go I can't wait
for your wife to divorce you she married
him in the first place [ __ ] she
might be crazy too
she might be worse for all we know
why don't you just assume that the
world's worst man married like an angel
she might be [ __ ] up you don't know
that
if her concern is being attacked at six
a.m any good husband would get his ass
out of the bed and walk her to her car
is that what she's scared of
this is a tough one for me I'm not
saying I wouldn't do it
I wouldn't be thrilled about it though
but I would also probably I don't know I
feel like I would just be like why don't
you just take the other car today and
I'll drive the Prius
this is also um
maybe this is like hater Tech maybe I
well I don't know we were victims of
crimes not just a week ago not but a
week ago
our barbecue cover got stolen right off
our patio we got that son of a [ __ ] on
the damn security camera
VPD is like please stop calling us we
have more serious problems but I'm like
is it 6 a.m doesn't strike me as like
Prime
getting jumped territory 5 a.m yeah man
100 percent
if you're still up at 5am
that's like you're in the ESPN Red Zone
but 6 a.m that's when the normies start
to like reclaim the Earth
like
say from around like 1am to 5 a.m is
when like
that's when I would be like I need uh
OnStar or something like that at six a.m
you're seeing people like walk out of
their house in bathrobes and pick up the
newspaper from their front step
so true at six a.m the normies Assemble
Diana
559 ah six we good listen I don't claim
to know how the mind of a violent
criminal works I just know what I
observe or what I think that I observe
in my imagination at least
I think I'm done with react Court mostly
just because I got to go to the bathroom
though okay that was react Court slash
marker react chord



bluntstones thanks for asking they're
amazing
first couple of times I wore them I mean
they're they're boots you know you got
to break them in
well I broke them in and now they're
like they're they're waterproof they're
tough but they also feel like a like a
slipper
like when you slide them on it doesn't
feel like you're wearing like a like a
Timberland hard boot or anything like
that it feels like it's it's like it
it's molded to your foot
feels amazing I'm not a sponsor they
don't have to sponsor everyone's buying
them without any kind of Kickback here
anyway
they're good they're good they're good
shoes Braun
am I the [ __ ] for asking my friend to
move a picture of him and his wife
because it made my wife uncomfortable me
and my wife Dahlia lost our apartment
two months ago and moved in with Mom
okay issues began to arise with Dahlia
and Mom and I had to ask my friend to
let us move in till I get enough money
to rent out his wife was away visiting
family and he agreed but even there some
issues started to arise I just want to
say I wonder what the common element is
here
FYI dolly is very shy around Anthony she
grew up in conservative home and so it's
understandable but sometimes it can be a
bit much I admit that I admit that
for example she freaked out when she
accidentally drank from his glass she
also made a fuss when he passed by the
guest room when she was lying down and
the door was open thankfully Anthony was
super understanding and we were able to
talk some of these issues out
let me say the obvious close the door
and don't steal his glass and then it
sounds like you don't have anything to
worry about
last night Dahlia was passing the hall
and noticed a framed picture of Anthony
and his wife kissing hanging in the hall
she told me about it and said it made
her uncomfortable she asked if I could
speak to Anthony about it but he didn't
take it well he gave me a look when I
spoke to him and said this was Bonkers
because first of all his wife put it
there second of all the picture holds
sentimental meaning to him and his wife
and his wife and argued that it wasn't
an explicit photo just a norm a normal
wedding kiss
we started arguing and he said that it
wasn't like it was hanging in the living
room wall which would also be perfectly
fine or a perfectly lit room
I asked him to be a little more
considerate because it's not like I
asked him to remove it completely just
move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't
reach or keep it off the wall till we
leave he said he was sorry but he
refused I explained how Dahlia was
feeling yeah I think I listen
I feel for the guy like the the op in
this post
because he's doing a great job of
explaining his feelings but he's missing
the next element which is just because
you explain how something makes you feel
doesn't mean you're right
or doesn't mean um that the other person
has an obligation to like do something
unreasonable in order to cause those
feelings to go away you're doing a
fantastic job of communicating your your
wants and desires you're just failing to
recognize that the wants and desires are
insane
he said he was sorry but he would not
move the picture we argued some more he
said it's his house and I was being
pushy and and kind of too comfortable to
make such demands and be pushy still
this morning Dalia refused to even come
out of the room until the picture is
moved Anthony's refusing which makes it
worse
now I feel like I'm getting stuck
between a rock and a hard place yes she
might just be overreacting but I feel
like this isn't such a big ask for
Anthony to decline sorry I need to
scroll scroll scroll through Anthony to
decline and turn down for what it's
worth if it were me I'd go the extra
mile to make sure my guests are
comfortable yeah well it's not you and
you lost your apartment so like I'm not
trying to
own like drop an own on you or whatever
I'm not trying to Simply burn you but
like you're the guest
I mean it's like a Beggars can't be
choosers at its base principles right
here
Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10
years I wouldn't have asked to move in
with him if I didn't have such a strong
bond with him he constantly he himself
constantly talks about all the things
and situations I helped him out with and
we are considered Brothers well it's
like you're just like your wife is um
no I don't say this to be glib your wife
is like a little crazy
like what's the problem
I mean and also can I tell you I I feel
like the the host guest thing I feel
like it goes both ways
both the host and the guests are
supposed to be magnanimous not just the
host
the host has an obligation to be like
let me know if I can get you anything if
I can make your life easier you need an
extra blanket you need an extra pillow
eat some food out of my fridge you know
you need a drink whatever but the guest
also anytime I've been a guest
especially like if I'm staying in a
friend's house for a couple days
I do my best to like use the bathroom as
little as possible which is insane but
that's my version of
magnemeninity magnamine in this that's
my version of being a nice guy is like
listen I'm not going to take like a
recreational poop in your toilet
I'll do if I have to go then I'm gonna
go
because I'm not crazy
but I'm not gonna if if it's like I
could go but I could also just wait an
hour and then I'd be home then I'm gonna
I'll wait an hour because that's what
being a good guest is all about I think
hey Tom all
do you want to leave buddy
he's he got freaked out by the fire
alarm I think
anyway I mean I can't I I don't even
know what I'm gonna be looking for in
the comments here it's obviously insane
to go into somebody's house and be
offended by a photo of them kissing
their spouse
I don't know it it sounds like your wife
needs to
so I'm not a psychiatrist
I it doesn't sound like your wife needs
therapy
it sounds like she needs to
like be she used to do like a 30 day
like intensive
retreat
of therapy and maybe then do like
therapy like once a week for the rest of
her life
she needs like a therapy like boot camp
and then like
the 30-day grants touching session sure
if you want to if you want to put it
that way
learn some yoga and meditate well I mean
like just don't be so weird why are you
so weird
I I mean I guess it's not like that easy
to be like normal but
but like it's easy okay maybe it's not
okay but I'm saying like I feel like
it's easy to not be this weird
like can't you just
like you could be weird but not act
weird in your friend's house when he let
you stay with him
you know what I mean
you could have weird thoughts you could
have weird behaviors in private
but then like to be
like you have to know at what she's 28
you gotta know that this is like not an
acceptable ask
for somebody who's letting you stay in
their house
like what are you trying to like
terraform this guy's house and turn it
into your house like it doesn't make any
sense
this either it does feel like there's
something missing here
anyway
you're the [ __ ] and so is your wife
you're in their home I will say by the
way people might think that this is like
rude to call the husband the [ __ ] but
he is the [ __ ] like he's the he's
society's first line of defense against
his wife I know how that sounds but at
the same time like he's got
and it works both ways my wife is
society's first line of defense against
me
when I get annoyed by something and I'm
like you know what I'm never gonna go
back to that store ever again she's like
why are you acting like a weirdo and I'm
like I don't know good point and then I
like chill out a little bit so you gotta
you have an obligation to yourselves and
each other but also the world to like
keep each other in line not just to be
like oh you want me to ask my friends
something insane
like you at least gotta push back a
little bit you got to be like
I'm not gonna do that that's crazy
and then you gotta take the bullet of
like having the argument and then if
she's still like well I'm not gonna
compromise then you're like all right I
guess I'm gonna go
that's my friend this insane thing and
then relay to her
what I already told her was going to
happen but
so he's kind of at least I'm not saying
he has to stop her but he has to at
least try seems like he's letting her
run like buck wild with insane requests
this is too much
you can do this in your own house
you are guests in their home because you
are currently homeless your wife is the
problem here get a grip you're the
[ __ ]
also like your wife couldn't handle
living with I don't know how long she
lived with his mom but like
hey Tom Mall hey buddy
colorectal surgeon yeah I don't know how
that happens I don't know how you get
that tag but I gotta send him a DM real
quick
I just don't like it if your own mom is
like you can't stay with us anymore
because your wife is a little too crazy
you're like
I think that's a bad sign I just don't
know why you're being so weird about it
there's not that much to mine here I
think but I just like
there's some I I need some more info
like does your wife go to the movies
what's your wife's favorite movie
obviously it's not going to have even a
single kiss in it I have to imagine
she's not okay with cussing is it God's
not dead three
I just need to know
probably Veggie Tales dude don't drag
VeggieTales into this okay
there's nothing wrong with VeggieTales
so you're right it's Apocalypto I just
love the way Mel Gibson uh the way he
makes the camera float so true
great reference
hold on someone said read the girls
night one next I'm just looking okay
just I'm looking to see if it's sad
or if it's funny because if it or both
I don't think this is funny I think this
is just sad
quite frankly
I can't read that one
just seems like a sad guy
am I the [ __ ] for returning my
husband's birthday gift to pay for the
birthday cake my daughter baked after he
refused to pay her
you know again I have not read this yet
but one thing that comes up all the time
in react court is why do people make
their lives so complicated
how much could a birthday cake possibly
cost
like and I'm going a high end here well
I don't know maybe if it was a Cake Boss
type thing I could be more money but
like
even if it's like 50 bucks you're really
gonna you're gonna let your your family
have a dispute over fifty dollars
as an adult
but you know what I could be wrong
because apparently they're the [ __ ]
so never mind
maybe maybe be careful what you wish for
basically the title my daughter has a
thing for baking she bakes cakes and
some I said not all I said some not all
sweets my daughter has a thing for
baking she bakes cakes and some I said
some not all sweets
I I guess she's worried that people are
going to read this and they're going to
be like hey can you make me like a
Napoleon
I don't understand the the the caveat
but anyway and makes money out of it by
selling her work to relatives friends
and supposedly us
absolute nightmare first sentence where
I don't really so okay basically the
title my daughter bakes and sells her
food to relatives and maybe us
my husband's her stepdad 45th birthday
took place days ago he asked my daughter
to bake him the birthday cake and she
agreed I told him about paying her to
which he responded with pay her get out
of here I'm her dad I insisted she's a
yes person and a people pleaser so won't
outright demand the money from him he
said he'd pay but days went by and he
didn't pay her a cent I decided to go
ahead and sell the wristwatch I bought
him as his as his birthday cake and pay
her for her
he okay hold on all righty you can't be
trusted to write it okay
I'm running this [ __ ] through the linter
I decided to go ahead and sell the
wristwatch I bought him as his birthday
gift and then used that money to pay her
he found out and went off on me I told
him he had enough time and should have
paid her even before he received the
cake he said I was teaching her to treat
familial relationships as transactional
and making her be materialistic
this is so hard to read I explained the
time effort and money she put towards
making the cake but he lashed out
verbally calling me an [ __ ] for
making this move and for enabling my
daughter to expect so much from family
that she's supposed to help with nothing
in return he's Furious and told almost
the whole family about how I took back
his birthday gift and returned it I got
enough shame from family members to
begin to think that I might be an
[ __ ] for how I dealt with this am I
the [ __ ] y'all my daughter did want
and expect to be paid if she intended
for it to be free then I would have kept
my mouth shut
also the wristwatch is inexpensive I
kept the rest of the money after giving
my daughter her share
um
it's just kind of crazy
[Laughter]
I mean
okay I'm just I'm I'm digesting a little
bit here okay
if he is
I got I I hate to say it okay I gotta
see a photo of the cake
because if this is some Cake Boss
[ __ ] and it's like three towers and it's
got fondant and it looks like grogu or
something like that
then that makes sense to me that
he should at least pay for the
ingredients
that's like a I don't think he should
have to pay parts and labor for a
birthday cake I I don't think it's
necessarily like a bad thing
to you know allow your daughter to kind
of treat it like a a business
it's his birthday though yeah when you
buy a cake like from the grocery store
on your birthday
you don't go hey can I get that birthday
cake and they're like sure that'll be
19.99 and you're like uh it's my
birthday
so I think that'll actually be on the
house the birthday cake business would
not be doing so hot if everybody got
free cakes on their birthday
from your own family yeah but she's 16.
like I mean we're getting lost in the
weeds here
I I think that as a 16 year old we don't
know if she has like an actual job
is she supposed to sell sweets to buy
the food to make her stepdad a birthday
cake like out of her own pocket I feel
like he could have offered to at the
very least bought the ingredients you
don't have to pay her like you know 20
bucks an hour or something like that to
to make the cake in the first place
but you should have bought like the eggs
and the and the flower I think at the
very least
anyway
but then like that notwithstanding I
mean there's just a lot of this that's
like strange to me
look what how much was this wristwatch
let's assume she bought him a 100 watch
she sold
the watch or returned it to the watch
store
paid her daughter
like
maybe 20 bucks
maybe 50 bucks pocketed the other 50.
it's just weird to me like I know that
there's probably like an easy answer for
this okay
why didn't she just pay her daughter
like the 20 bucks and then give her
husband The Watch
like you're in this why why does why
does the the burden of paying for the
birthday cake exclusively fall to the
stepfather that doesn't make sense like
you're 45 years old
you don't do things as a team
the poster has a minus 1800 comment in
this thread oh my god oh no foreign
it's just weird I mean it's just a very
uh I know it happens a lot in react
Court these are just it's a very weird
situation
like why do this to yourself is it I you
I I say on this one my verdict is
gsrp you got to get some real problems
because you I I do believe and I think
that this is one of the curses of
humanity
I think that mankind is wired
to always seek conflict
in order to have something to overcome
this seems like a situation where you
could have just the situation could have
been very amenable if you just produced
a twenty dollar bill gave it to your
daughter and then now that you could
have avoided a fight with your husband
you would have avoided a a fight between
your husband and your daughter it would
have been completely okay but instead
maybe maybe you didn't have it maybe you
were bored and you're like let's throw a
nail bomb into the family just uh you
know just to Define our October or
whatever so anyway
um
it's just it just seems like this is not
as an as a middle-aged adult you have to
like be smarter than this if you want to
enjoy your life as much as possible in
my opinion if this is the kind of thing
that can that can blow up in your
family's face you gotta learn that a
prevention an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure
like what's yeah you're right the
daughter was just chilling she's just
making a cake now she got dragged into
this
she's the third person into a fight that
doesn't involve her at all like this is
It's Madness
it's just weird
info did he think that cake was her gift
to him who pays for the supplies do you
pay for your own birthday cake I find it
strange that you'd make him pay for his
own birthday cake rather than pay for
yourself who has someone to pay for
their own birthday cake you're the
[ __ ] edit daughter doesn't pay for
supplies op does okay
who asked I asked I guess I've never in
my life heard of a person expecting to
get paid for making a close relative's
birthday cake I mean if your daughter
owned a bakery and your husband went in
and put it in an order then yes and
seriously as his wife it would be normal
that you provide the birthday cake
whether you make it yourself or buy one
at the local bakery that is that is true
I agree this is weird
I mean that's true a 16 year old making
you a birthday cake is a a more than
acceptable gift from your 16 year old
child
it's better than getting like a you know
a 50 Amazon gift card or something like
that
it should like it doesn't need to be
transactional the transaction is already
like implied
this is one of the most bizarre posts
I've ever seen I'm not going to call
anyone an [ __ ] because I think you're
in the wrong subreddit buddy
you are in the wrong subreddit I think a
lot of this comes down to gory details
about time frames and who directly asked
what of whom but this is an extremely
strange thing to litigate this hard who
expects a family member to pay them for
a birthday cake on their birthday who
wages a proxy war about it on behalf of
someone who apparently doesn't want
payment enough to advocate for it
themselves and then returns a president
as Revenge instead of just reminding him
but also who puts their wife on blast to
the entire family over a birthday
present I diagnose you all with weird
and Petty disease your sentence is to
drink a glass of water and count to ten
okay honestly
the the rare Reddit post that I'm like
that's actually pretty funny in my
opinion I I could see myself saying that
just doesn't seem like they should have
uh
it shouldn't blow up in their face this
much hold on I'm finding the comment
info have you talked to your daughter
did she want to be paid
yes of course she did she said it
herself but did not say it to him
directly minus eighteen hundred I mean
that's like uh that comment is not that
insane it's just a conduit for people
who disagree with her which is fair
because what she's saying is crazy but
anyway
I diagnose you weird weird
am I the [ __ ] for refusing to take
down a video of my kid's father dancing
in my brother's wedding
my children's dad and I got separated
and divorced two years ago we're on good
terms regarding co-parenting and since
he's close to my brother my brother had
invited him to his wedding perfectly
okay with me since the kids were
thrilled to get extra time with their
dad
I was taking a video of mom and my kids
at the wedding and posted it on my insta
hours later I get a call from my ex
yelling about my camera catching him
dancing drunkenly in the background I
said so what he tells me he's getting
engaged to his conservative girlfriend
soon and if her or her conservative
family saw him in the video then there's
going to be trouble
I thought that was silly he demanded I
take it down but I declined he insisted
saying he was technically recorded via
my
recordered via my camera and he did not
consent I called him ridiculous and
Confused to take him take it down he's
gotten the kids involved now which got
me mad and made the argument escalate
Mom is saying I should take it down but
I feel like he's trying to console
control my social media activity am I
the [ __ ] for refusing he said that
his girlfriend Kenan will see it via the
kids since they're with me on social
media why wouldn't you just take it down
I don't understand
why would she because she posted a video
that he's in that he's not comfortable
with being on the internet
can't you just crop it like it's a it's
20 22.
I mean she can be mad she can think it's
like unreasonable but
current Paul well
[Laughter]
everyone gets drunk at weddings yeah but
like I just don't understand like it
almost doesn't matter
what the video is of like if they have a
problem with it they should take it down
I don't understand the
I just don't understand why she wouldn't
take it down
I agree by the way I think he's being
like overly anal about it
but at the same time like you know
I mean I I feel like it's almost it's
probably not an absolute situation like
I'm sure there's some situations where
you would be like I'm not taking this
down just out of principle this one just
seems like you should just take it down
for sure like
and this is the the potential problem
with social media right it's like
hey I was just enjoying myself at a
wedding now the video's online
my spouse side she she thinks that I'm
sloppy she's lost respect for me my my
boss saw it and now I'm gonna be uh
passed over for a promotion at work
because they think I you know can't be
trusted or something like it's just
there should be a right to like more
privacy than this
he's in the background well yeah but
he's in the video I don't understand the
problem
people that need to get over being
recorded
I don't know I mean like I get that it's
getting worse but I don't necessarily
think it should be normalized that like
I mean my personally
I don't really well I don't know I'm
trying to figure out where to approach
this one from
I don't think you should have an
expectation that you're not going to be
filmed like I I think you should be on
acceptable behavior pretty much anywhere
just in principle
like not just because you think you
might be being recorded but at the same
time like it is annoying like sometimes
may it might be maybe it's a
generational thing but like you ever go
out to karaoke and then like you start
singing a song at karaoke and somebody
pulls out their phone and starts filming
it you're like well it was my wife I'm
like I'm not gonna say anything but it
was just like a friend that said karaoke
I'm like yo can you put your phone away
like I'm I thought we were all having
like a just a night out here where we
could like have some fun and we could
keep this stuff like in memory we don't
necessarily need to be like oh film this
look I'm at karaoke posted to like my
seven Instagram followers so that like
two of them can click the hard button
and be like so fun like I don't
understand
like I think you could if you're at
karaoke
and you film yourself dancing or someone
films you dancing or something like that
and then you post it on your Instagram
that's not a big deal
but like as soon as you start catching
random people that might not want that
stuff to be posted
I find that uh I mean I'm not saying
that
I mean here's what I think the situation
should do
uh here's what I think the situation
should be I think you should be able to
post it without asking permission from
everybody in the venue but I do think if
somebody happened to be recorded in the
video is like oh I don't want that to be
posted on social media you should be
like understandable I'll take it down
and edit it
that seems like the way that the normal
Loop of behavior
every wedding is filmed yeah but like
most you know again maybe it's
generational but like
the weddings were filmed you know 20
years ago the video was like trotted out
at family gatherings and like 10 family
members would see the video Once at
Christmas and you know blah blah blah
now it's like hey check out this wedding
that I'm at and look at this [ __ ] in
the background
either way just generally just if you
want to be not the [ __ ] then I think
if somebody is like
hey I'm in your video could you take it
down and edit me out then not being the
[ __ ] means you have to say yes okay
no problem
you probably I don't know if you have a
legal right to keep it up
or a legal to keep it up if you want to
I should say but like to be a nice
person then yeah you gotta you gotta
take it down
hi Tomo do you want to leave
mm-hmm
anyway
listen I'm not even getting into the
idea
that like
she's only doing it because she it
resents him or something maybe there's a
chance of that
even I think we're getting into like
this is too legal
I know that some people you know they
like to live their their lives according
to the Illinois Appellate Court but
regardless of the law which is a
dangerous sentence to say I feel like
even if you're within your legal rights
to like post a video if someone that you
have to interact with like uh you know
every weekend for the rest of your life
your lives is like hey I'm uncomfortable
with that being posted you just take
that [ __ ] down and then you like
complain in your group chat you go I
can't believe that [ __ ] wanted me to
take the video down and then no matter
how the people in the group chat feel
about it because some of them might
agree with him
the people in the group chat go oh I
know it's on it's unreasonable I mean
come on it's a wedding just lighten up a
little bit
that's the way that you have to
communicate and and behave in the real
world
pardon me anyway
yeah plus what about gdpr I don't really
know what gdpr is
but I feel like this is a gdpr issue
I feel like that he did not accept all
the cookies okay
ask yourself this is this silly video
worth destroying your co-parenting
relationship with him because he is
absolutely right to demand you take it
down if he's featured in it no one says
you have to delete it off your phone so
the memory isn't gone but it's Petty of
you to insist it should remain online
um baster editor received the Reddit
shooting star and golden update for this
post
he's not taking responsibility for his
actions though I mean what he didn't do
anything wrong
he just doesn't want it to be in public
nothing wrong with getting a little too
drunk at a wedding and dancing but like
you might not want it to be filmed
you know if you're swimming in a in a
pool
you you might
not have a reasonable expectation of
privacy but if someone took a video and
was like check out this dude's
midsection you might be like hey yeah
I'm uncomfortable with that can you take
that [ __ ] down
you just put like a like a gaussian blur
on them or something like that
you're not expecting to be filmed at a
pool why not it's a public pool there's
no expectation of privacy
I just don't understand why she wouldn't
solve the problem by taking the video
down she doesn't even have to edit it
and like repost it
if you could just have the video on her
phone she probably got like six
followers on Instagram anyway she could
just get like a a big brunch going and
show more people like literally on her
device
I don't understand
it just it seems like she wants to fight
everybody sucks here he had no
expectation of privacy at a wedding
where between guests and I hired
photographer cameras are all over the
place on the other hand it's one video
would it really be so terrible for you
to remove it or make it private I think
this is a great response
ignore this part
because honestly I mean again I'm not
sure if this is if this makes any
rhetorical sense
it's none of our business what his
relationship with his spouse is I think
I think that's like or his fiance I
think that that's literally like we're
getting into hearsay hearsay it's like
two arms length away from the situation
the situation is pretty much regardless
of the reason if he doesn't want that
video of him being filmed to be on there
it would be a nice thing to do to take
it down
like I think the catch is if there was
like a road rage incident
and you caught it on dash cam
and then the person who did the road
rage was like can you take that video
down it's embarrassing I would be like
absolutely not like this is evidence
but like the fact that he's he doesn't
want his fiance to see that he was a
little sloppy at the wedding is like it
it doesn't seem like that's information
that we should have access to like
you've declared a a public VAR that
should be private I don't it's
you're not we we have access to more
data than is relevant in order to make
the actual judgment here
you're the [ __ ] I don't think he
needs a reason if someone asks you to
take down a pic or video you should
unless you have a good reason to keep it
up
I honestly this is a I felt like I was
so uh by the way Kitty exorcism thanks
for the gifted subscriptions thank you
thank you I felt like I was crazy
everybody was like they have no legal
right to privacy then I scroll down and
there's but you realize this is a
situation where Reddit is like more
normal than twitch
I can't believe it
or you're as weird as the average
redditor
I think red is right in this situation
honestly it's a scary thought but I
you put me on on Reddit or twitch then I
am a
I guess I'm on Reddit for this one I
hate to say it not because I I mean I
think that he should not necessarily
expect that people should not be filming
him in public but she should just take
it down
I mean you gotta like you gotta
co-parent with this person
you really want them to like resent you
more than they already do probably
again it seems like a situation where
like the path of least resistance seems
like
I don't know like why do you want to
fight you could just do two Taps and be
like okay that done then you don't have
to write out the Reddit post to read a
thousand um
a thousand replies like just okay sorry
deleted
anyway it's just weird
just weird
to me at least am I the [ __ ] for
taking my daughter's phone away
I have a daughter who recently turned
11. she has a different dad from the
rest of my children whenever one of my
kids turns 12 I buy them their first
phone which is usually a cheap phone
because I don't think a kid needs an
expensive phone
fairly reasonable so far
she's been complaining recently and
asking me to buy her a phone because all
her friends have one I told her she has
to wait like her siblings did so imagine
my surprise when she comes home from her
dad's and has a phone with her and not
just a cheap phone I don't know much
about phones but it looked expensive I
was Furious so I took her phone away and
told her she's not getting it back till
she turns 12. she started to cry and
called her dad wait a second the plot
thickens
how did she call her dad I'm not I'm
going to assume that maybe they have a
cordless still maybe they have one of
those like hey if you pay for the
internet we'll give you the home phone
for free or something like that
maybe they maybe they got Microsoft
teams I don't know
I told him he had no right to buy that
for she should have gotten a cheap phone
at her 12th birthday like the rest of
her siblings this is just like I mean
I know that this one says [ __ ]
I feel like you can't take your kid's
phone away when they've been given it as
a gift by the other parent
but I definitely feel like the dad from
what we know in this situation is
definitely the [ __ ] like
the kid didn't do anything wrong so for
the kid to be punished makes no sense I
think but you should really like
lay into the dad
like you had a
an arrangement you're so again I think
you know what I'm realizing from like
these posts here is like it seems like
being divorced is like really [ __ ] up
things that would normally be like a a
relatively easy situation they got this
complex layer of like resentment and
revenge built on top of it
like I feel like it's almost like the
inverse of the last situation where I'm
like wouldn't the dad couldn't the dad
just be like a little smarter no
disrespect to him because we don't know
anything about him except what he bought
for his daughter
but like if your 11 year old daughter is
like can you give me a phone
don't you just shoot like a quick text
to your ex-wife and be like hey she said
like she wants a phone what do you think
and then like even if you don't like
each other you gotta like you're
co-parenting you gotta
you gotta come to a decision you don't
have to text your
ex-wife and be like is it okay if we go
to Chipotle for lunch but like of the
first phone is like that's kind of a big
deal
I don't mean like it's a milestone like
getting your driver's license but I mean
it changes your lifestyle in in a way
that means that both parents should at
least like have a have a say in it
so I don't know it's this is everybody
sucks here except the kid I don't think
the kid did anything wrong
it's just stupid it's it I I mean I
don't know I diagnosed the dad as stupid
you just got to send a text
I don't
know I like a lot of people are laying
into him saying like oh he's trying to
be the daughter's preferred parent by
buying her a phone when his ma her mom
wouldn't let her get a phone we don't
know that but like he should just like I
mean it could be true for the record but
like
we don't we can't just assume that I
think it's also easy to assume that he's
just like you know at a bit of a brain
fart and was like you know he may be
stressed out or hungry or something and
then his daughter's like can you buy me
a phone and he's like yeah whatever
whatever gets me like an extra
90 minutes of like quiet time sure like
that there's a lot of there's Myriad
possible options here but I definitely
think that whether there was ill intent
or not that the dad dropped the ball but
you also I mean I feel like the mom's
just kind of gotta eat it and be like
okay I guess I guess you're getting your
phone before your 12th birthday then
Joe Biden would never buy his kid a
phone he would ask first absolutely true
and that's why he's my president
Joe Biden would text first
Joe Biden before he made a decision like
this would send a text and then write is
that okay
and then if he didn't get a reply in
like an hour he would be like hey I know
like we're not together anymore but we
really need to be on the same page with
co-parenting it's not for us we have to
put our differences aside it's for the
well-being of our daughter I'm not going
to get her a phone today but you guys
can talk about it when you pick her up
and then he would put like seven emojis
of like crossed eyes tongue sticking out
because that's how everybody over the
age of the 60 seems to text
anyway
just don't understand like um again like
it's just it's just making it so
complicated man
I'm also kind of amazed genuinely
because this is something we're going to
have to deal with at some point
I feel like 12 is almost a little old in
the modern era to give your kid a phone
I'm not saying that you should let your
kid have unfettered access to a
smartphone when they're single digits
but like
to have like a a phone that just has
like calling and texting
for your kid when they go to school that
seems pretty sensible
I mean yeah I didn't get a I didn't get
a smartphone until I was like 23 or
something but at the same time the [ __ ]
didn't exist until I was 21. like the
world has changed
I can't really put myself in the shoes
of uh of a modern 12 year old because
my eight-year-old niece has a flip phone
I mean I think that's it makes sense to
me
when I taught in Korea it was 2011.
and like first graders had smartphones
but then also they were like
riding the Subway by themselves and like
walking 20 minutes to go to school so
that seems I mean there's just they're a
little bit more independent at it at a
younger age over there
mostly I mean they live in like
the public transit some more walkable
cities but anyway
maybe yeah maybe a flip phone or
something I don't know we'll have to
deal with it at some point
am I the [ __ ] for going to a
restaurant she likes but I don't order
food
please tell me this doesn't end with
it's my girlfriend's uh birthday she
wanted to go to a fancy restaurant I
don't feel like paying 23 for an entree
that's one bite of food I said I'll it's
fine I'll just go through the McDonald's
drive-through afterwards
okay let's see
let's I'm just guessing I'm just
guessing
we were deciding what to eat and she
really wanted to go to this restaurant I
was on board with it but I'm super picky
I had no idea what this restaurant had
we get there I look at the menu nothing
looks even semi-good for example all of
the sandwiches had wheat bread and I
hate wheat oh you hate wheat but you
love bread make it make sense just
impression Dash 1843
make it make sense
I only eat flour that's been bleached
before it's been pounded into a dough
and baked
anyway I let her order her food and when
the lady asked what I want I told her I
wasn't eating I told my girlfriend I
wanted her to enjoy the meal and I was
happy to be there okay the world's most
naive man on the planet not naive man I
guess a naive person really but they say
I know we're only on the first paragraph
but like
you can't you also when you're enjoying
a meal together you can't be like let
them order and then hit them with the
like this says you when it comes turn
for you to order you have to at least be
like hey just so you know I'm not like
that into anything on this menu so you
can eat but I'm not gonna have something
it'll still be uncomfortable
but I think you should also recognize
that
like that's the better possible
situation if you refuse to eat wheat
bread but we'll only eat white bread
like you did it to yourself
I don't know what to tell you
like you you create you're if you're
like that sounded like it'd be awkward
yeah the whole thing is awkward you went
to an adult restaurant but you have the
palette of a child apparently with with
no disrespect I'm just calling it like I
see it
I told her I wasn't eating I told my
girlfriend I wanted her to enjoy the
meal I was happy to be there my
girlfriend got so mad she got up and
left I left with her and asked what the
big deal was she insists I need to be
there eating with her we ended up going
somewhere else together it irritated me
and I am am I in the wrong here oh no
here we go
it was some French cafe I've never been
to a French restaurant but I was willing
to check it out their menu wasn't very
big I just wanted her to enjoy a nice
meal I let the first update
means you don't understand the situation
regardless of the kind of restaurant it
was it that that's very much like on the
side of the actual issue
I'm not saying you have to be like uh
you have to be an adventurous eater but
can I and I know we go into picky eating
a lot okay
when I was like until I was about 17 I
was like the pickiest Eater of all time
I didn't like soup
they didn't like rice it's like it just
seems like a lot of I know it's a Mitch
Hedberg joke it just seems like a lot of
work to eat rice look at the way there's
so many of these
I mouth will tell you we used to go to
Subway I would get a foot long turkey
sandwich on whole wheat bread cheese
yellow mustard no toppings at all ooh
lettuce ooh onions don't even get me
started on tomatoes then when I got to
University I was like you know what it's
a good time to take stock nobody here
knows you
you can reinvent yourself if you want so
one thing I did is like it's a at age 17
is a great time for me to get over being
a picky eater Endeavor to eat some new
foods try some cream based sauces and
stuff like that because in my head I
could see in the future
and I was like I don't want this [ __ ]
happening to me I don't want to go out
you know it's my 30th wedding
anniversary and I'm like can I have a
I'll I'll take the House Pub burger with
no toppings and no condiments and french
fries hold the ketchup on the side like
I just wanted I wanted a wider breadth
of experience later in life
so I said you know let's just start
eating some stir fries wow that's tasty
wow who knew red peppers were so
delicious mushrooms not really my scene
but maybe in 15 years you know what I
mean that's why you got to do it so you
don't end up in the you he created the
conflict here
anyway sorry
I'm it's one of the best gifts I ever
gave to myself
if you eat something and you don't like
it that's fine but to not eat something
new because you don't think it would you
would like it and your palate stays like
this small forever
if you got a wide array of foods that
are acceptable
and then you're like I don't feel like
trying caviar then okay
but if you if you're like I only eat
chicken fingers and someone's like do
you want to try like a grilled cheese
and you're like I don't know then you
like I think you can meet them in the
middle okay
I think you could you could take a bite
at least what's the worst that could
happen you take a bite and you're like
oh this isn't the best food I've ever
eaten
like just get over it
anyway sorry
[Laughter]
moving on
there was no waitress we ordered at the
counter and they put the food on our
tray what it wasn't even uh
like a fancy restaurant is like a
cafeteria
I thought it was like a like a sit-down
restaurant it was going to be like
escargot uh Frog's legs and stuff like
that but that is it's they're at like a
Panera
it's Predator mange
also we've been together for 10 months
so I don't think there's much to feel
awkward about
I have no listen Okay this is like way
too close to the Bone
you know how like there's some crazy men
online that are like I never lose an
argument with my girlfriend because if I
did she would lose respect for me those
people are insane but there is a little
voice in my head that's like if you
don't get over your aversion to whole
wheat bread as somebody that eats white
bread
she's gonna lose respect for you it's
not about being like an alpha male it's
just about like not being like
like a little kid with no I I don't I'm
just
if you have a a narrow palette but it's
not crazy like that's one thing
but like to be like ooh whole wheat
bread on my sandwich like
we gotta
you gotta nut up a little bit I think or
take it to the extreme and be like I
don't eat any bread because they're like
the same thing
they're all in this I don't know where
they live but especially like in North
America
whole wheat bread like that you buy it
at a grocery store is just like
like if you closed your eyes you almost
wouldn't be able to tell the difference
in taste there's like a two percent
taste difference
and if you think that there's like a 50
taste difference then I think you're the
op
I'm sorry for constructing this box
which makes it hard for you to argue
it's it's rhetorically dishonest
but it made my point feel stronger so
I'm glad I said it
anyway
I have no allergies for the most part I
can usually find something to eat at a
restaurant but I couldn't find something
to eat this was a lunch not a dinner
update I didn't Google the menu
beforehand because we've never gone to a
restaurant and find something to eat
this was a lunch not a dinner can I say
something
I'm losing my mind okay
the fact that every single one of the
updates is just about like some magic
bullet solution where like why didn't
you Google the menu beforehand why don't
you just take some responsibility
I know people were like why didn't you
Google the menu beforehand you don't
have to respond to that
that's like
it's just why don't you I don't even
know where to go with this one
like I mean if you're
all other things being equal
if you can't find something at a
predator mange that you think you could
eat I don't mean that you would love
necessarily
but if there's like 10 things on a menu
designed to be served to a general
population if you can't find like a
single thing
you gotta like that's your to-do list
for like the next month is to have like
learn
another food that you like so that this
doesn't happen again
maybe learn you could there's foods you
can get almost anywhere you can get a
Caesar salad almost anywhere you can get
like a soup almost anywhere you just
gotta add like what you can get maybe
like even just a croissant or something
like that that's like that's bread you
just gotta just
learn like one or two things that could
get you out of this situation okay
soup isn't a meal yeah but he literally
ate nothing
hey nothing
that's not a meal either
could at least like sit down have a nice
uh dining experience with your with your
partner and then when you go home and
she's like I gotta go to the bathroom
real quick you open up your
fridge and you know shove like four
cheese strings in your mouth or
something like that
anyway
so I just learned that all Bread is made
of wheat which is not technically true
but I I understand your point it was
some type of whole grain or sourdough
what I meant to say is I only like white
bread but brioche buns are good too see
he's not that picky of an eater he likes
both white bread and brioche
so white bread and white bread plus
um
like triple the eggs and butter in the
recipe
don't say he doesn't have exotic tastes
update 10 months into the relationship
and we never went to a place where I
couldn't find something to eat this was
the first time that it happened also I
do try new things I'm not stubborn with
it but
I'm
on your side
I'm not looking for stuff to get mad at
I want to preface this I'm on your side
you are stubborn if you won't eat a
whole grain bread
or a sourdough bread sandwich
it's not like they're asking you to eat
like
like a whole oyster if someone's like I
don't want to eat an oyster I get it
you're eating a whole slimy salty kind
of like weirdly metallic tasting
organism but if you're like I want a ham
sandwich on white bread and they're like
we only have whole grain and you're like
that's too much for me then you are
being stubborn
you're not that's not a reasonable
refusal to have The High Ground
to be in the right in this situation
now if he said no to Italian herbs and
cheese we would lock him up we'd put him
in prison
also I do try new things I'm not
stubborn with it but usually it's me
trying her food because I only order
things I know I'll like I don't like
wasting food nor my money I listen I
know how this sounds okay and if you're
a picky eater you're not going to want
to hear this and maybe I'm maybe this is
a straw man maybe I'm making it up you
might be like a good partner
but I feel like there is a chance that
she's just gonna leave you for the
convenience of being able to eat at a
normal restaurant with a another person
like you it just it sounds like this is
you you ever see the Tweet that's like
being in a relationship is just asking
the other person what you want to eat
for dinner every day before you die
like there's some truth to that like
food is it's a ritual that you do every
day or at least several times a week for
every meal to be like I gotta step on
these eggshells because his palette is
so narrow
like there's there's gonna it's gonna
great on you it might be okay 10 months
in the relationship because you got like
blinders on to some extent but at the
same time like you know in 10 years
maybe you're gonna have like a bad day
and then she's gonna be plus I can't
take this [ __ ] to any restaurant that
doesn't have uh
dinosaur chicken nuggets on the menu and
she might snap that might be like the
straw that that broke the the camel's
back you know
so I think like it it rather than just
constantly be like here's my reasons for
this
I just want to see an update that's like
okay I'm going to work on expanding my
palette
so or or at least like just pretend
you know
can't you just get the sandwich eat half
of it and and then you know struggle
through it and then if she's like oh you
you don't want the rest of your sandwich
you'll be like no it's really good I'm
just full
you know just tell like a little white
lie like that because it's not about the
meal it's about the experience it's
about you and your partner doing
something together
would you try a 7-Eleven Pizza
yeah if Kate was like I really want a
7-Eleven Pizza I would go pick one up
I mean there have been restaurants that
I've gone to with Kate where I look at
the menu and I'm like I'm not sure
anything here is like
like it seems like it would be up my
alley but I was still like okay let's
I'll take the I'll take the maze soba
and then it comes out and I'm like oh at
least eat it I'll give it a try
but we went to Japan we went to the the
konyaku restaurant
I said we looked at a a menu consisting
exclusively of
kanji
and I said what is any of this and she
said I don't really know what any of
this is but all of it's konyaku and I
said
send this sister just get whatever you
think makes sense and then like you know
these weird like jelly triangles came
out with some hot mustard on the side
and I uh
I mean I ate them and then she said what
do you think about this and I said with
all honesty it's the worst Food I've
ever eaten in my entire life
it's probably the most disgusting thing
I've ever but I still I'm glad I did it
because like not just because like
I know now that I don't want them but
also because it's like a
you know we had a story together that
we're like hey remember those trying you
know it's like seven years later I can
be like this isn't great but at least
it's better than those triangles we had
in Japan and you've got like a legacy
together
and it's a good anecdote
did Kate not like them either I think
she she didn't detest them as much as I
did I don't think she would order it
again
I I actively detested the the food I
hated everything about it but I still
ate like
like half of the dish
just to be like let's just see you know
maybe the first bite just took me
unawares and and now that I'm used to it
it tastes familiar but no the whole
thing was like
I mean it was cursed from the get-go
I mean like listen I'm not saying you
can't be a picky eater All I'm gonna say
is like again this is why if possible it
would be nice to Endeavor not to be a
picky eater because it's just gonna make
your life harder
like if you're like oh it's so hard to
be a picky eater I can't find any food
that I like I'm like yeah I know
like that's why
like I'm not anymore
like I know it's not that easy and
you know some people have genuine
reasons for being a picky eater but like
it does me if if people around you like
close to you get annoyed by how picky of
an eater you are
I think it's you can't be annoyed that
they're annoyed
I guess is what I'm trying to say
because it's annoying
to not it's the same thing and and this
is like not necessarily related to pick
eating but it's the same reason like you
know the first few packages we went to
would be like everyone we know let's go
to a restaurant and then you realize
like you know oh one person has been
walking all day they have to go to a
sit-down restaurant one person uh
refuses to pay more than seven dollars
for their meal one person's vegetarian
one person uh only eats meat never eats
vegetables one person has never tried uh
Asian food in their life and will never
one person has heard of this restaurant
called PF Changs and absolutely has to
go there before they die
and you're like we can't find a place
that that couldn't fit all of the
everybody's got one condition they're
like it's reasonable it's just one
condition you add up all of those 12
conditions and you're like we're going
to McDonald's because that's the only
thing that's available to to this you
know widely diverse group of interests
so instead now when we go to Pax we run
[ __ ] lean
I'll get a table for two at whatever
restaurant it feels like my wife and I
would like to eat at the most and then
you guys can spend three hours debating
where you're gonna go for dinner
eventually go to Jimmy John's and then
we'll meet up for board games afterwards
it's just easier to dine in smaller
groups like it because it just opens up
a wider array of options okay
I mean there's picky and then there's
adult who only eats white bread picky
the place had sandwiches for crying out
loud how much of a surprise could it be
that you didn't like anything if you're
that picky I think the burden is on you
to do some research ahead of time
someone like someone with a food allergy
or dietary restrictions would
you're the [ __ ] for showing up
unprepared and almost making your
girlfriend eat solo no one likes doing
that and it's kind of rude to the
restaurant and wait staff as well
immediately Vindicated
I love it Jeepers Creepers 74 the prime
ministered
you're the [ __ ] picky eaters are so
exhausting
sharing a dining experience with them is
so limiting and seems like half the time
they will want to go to the same limited
choices over and over
it's different if someone has dietary
restrictions because of medical issues
religion or their vegetarian vegan
restrictions like this are easy to
understand and there's reasoning behind
it someone just wanting nuggies and
hitting on wheat bread is a nightmare go
try something new
this is not what I said
I said you're welcome to be a picky
eater just don't be surprised when
your girlfriend leaves you for someone
who isn't afraid of Dijon mustard that's
what I what I said was way more
offensive
plus they're not just in the chicken
nuggets that's intellectually dishonest
they like both white bread and brioche
bread brioche it's a French word it's
Continental cuisine
you're the [ __ ] seems like a
passive-aggressive protest I mean that's
where I'm at like to let your partner
order something and then be like
actually I'm fine when you talked about
going to
lunch together
like that that is like you you prank to
them you sprung something on them
now I gotta sit there and eat my meal
while you're sitting there just like
looking at your phone the whole time
like I'm gonna feel self-conscious like
the whole time
that one felt good
that felt like a good one
am I the [ __ ] for not clamping when
my sister sang in her voice class
well is it because she was bad
are you really gonna be okay I should
probably read the post before I get
upset but like
you I hate when people are like being
principled is good if your principles
are sane but just like the post where
it's like you know the guy's girlfriend
was like do I look fat and then the guy
was like I think it's immoral to ever
tell a lie
so I said yes before I before I answer
this I just want you to know I don't
think any less of you as a person I
think you're a great friend and a great
partner I love spending time with you
that being said yes yes you do look a
little fat
but like
being
what what's the word that they they uh
Silicon Valley CEOs use uh radical
honesty this is like this people were
like well we're only supposed to clap
and we enjoyed a performance
you realize you're talking about
hitting your hands together in a
rhythmic fashion to produce noise like a
caveman get over yourself
just just do the bare minimum to like
make them feel better
just to not get yourself in trouble so
this post doesn't have to exist anyway
like just get over yourself you're
literally just a guy



my sister and I are taking the same
voice class at a community college a
requirement of the classes that you sing
five times over the course of the
semester my sister is incredibly shy and
has sang five times but it's always been
on Zoom for the professor why is that so
much more
anxiety-inducing to me
to to stream
you singing on Zoom seems like 10 times
more Awkward than singing in public
a couple things are nobody knows I'm her
sister
me uh Pepe in the corner of the party
nobody knows I'm her sister we all know
we saw you make the am I the [ __ ]
post
you guys eat lunch together every day
and our four years apart in age we all
you got the same names
they don't I saw that uh yesterday it's
blade in the corner
but uh the sprinklers are on at the
party and they're shooting out blood and
blade is saying they don't know it's
open season on all suck heads I think
I'm in my blade posting Arc honestly
the thing is some [ __ ] really
are trying to UPS ice skate uphill
no not not drain gang I'm talking about
blade
you know the the day Walker
he's like a half vampire half normal guy
the shitty Marvel snap card hey he's not
that bad a 1-3 that is a discard engine
as long as it discards apocalypse is
okay anyway
a couple things nobody knows I'm her
sister and she's by far the youngest in
the class so everyone babies her a
little my mom's friend's daughter Anna
is also in the class and my mom asked
Anna to watch my sister make sure she's
doing okay Anna also drives my sister
to and from class because I go with my
friends Anna babies her a lot she also
gives her candy and takes her out to eat
before class and she makes sure
everyone's really nice there I mean
she's literally 15 years old so this
does not seem crazy it sounds like
you're you resent the fact that you're
a teenage sister is being treated like a
child when she is a child
my sister sang on Tuesday when she was
in a practice room Anna went around and
told everyone to clap for her no matter
how she does and to only give nice
comments because she's terrified then my
sister sang and she sucked she was
looking down the whole time and had her
arms around her chest they had to
restart the song twice for her she was
ahead of the music and didn't get half
the notes right everyone clap for her
except for me
why
why do this to yourself
is it a self-inflicted wound it's like
Matthew Perry saying how come River
Phoenix is dead but Keanu Reeves is
still alive when Keanu Reeves was just
living his life like you just have no
reason to create this problem for
yourselves you could have just gone you
could have just clapped great job gone
home watched Netflix make a grilled
cheese whatever like who cares
I don't think I was rude I just told her
the song needs a lot more work she
should probably pick a different song
and she needs to calm down before she
sings again bro you're in a community
college voice class [ __ ] relax
like it's not you're not a Juilliard
you're not uh the cast of Hamilton or
something like that what's the problem
you're in a voice a voice class
at Community College
you're in a class with a with a 15 year
old kid how serious could it be
why would why go in so hard
Anna ended up taking her home this is
kind of like
okay so again this is not meant to be
punching down
but like in 2015 I was like I feel like
getting some night classes in okay
so I I was like maybe I'll I'll learn
some computer programming so the first
place I looked was Vancouver Community
College
I thought I've never been to Community
College before in my life I thought that
I could go learn computer programming
there maybe that was naive of me I I
opened up the course calendar
figure out what was going to happen you
know September or I think it was like
spring semester 2015 and the [ __ ] was
like
get a diploma in Food Service learn how
to paint bird houses learn and I was
like wait like no disrespect but this is
clearly not the institution that I that
I should be angling towards in order to
get the education that I'm looking for
in this particular domain that's not to
say like I think it would be cool now
that I've given up on on having any
ambition in life to go to a community
college and be like you know what maybe
I'll take a class on like sports
broadcasting or something like that
maybe I'll take a class on uh it would
be nice to take a class on on carpentry
or something like that to learn how to
I'm not going to be a carpenter but to
be a little bit more handy or something
like that for sure
instead I went to you know a a technical
institute
and then you know the rest is history
I'm here before you today
but like you don't need to be this
extreme in your criticism you're in a
community college voice class you're not
Simon Cowell on American Idol like I
don't understand the
I don't understand where you get off
trying to be like the the bad cop
do your own family especially
Anna ended up taking her home early when
she got back to class she pulled me
aside and asked me if I really had to
make those comments and if it was
absolutely necessary I'm mad at
op not just for being a [ __ ] but for
making Anna's life harder
like Anna's now she's pretty oh now I
have to pay the cost of being nice
I have become The Bodyguard for the 15
year old so now out of nowhere someone
chose violence and now I've gotta
mediate like what's the
you're just you're making things hard
for everyone around you like is life not
hard enough
I said I would have said that to
everybody she doesn't get special
treatment just because she's afraid to
talk or sing in front of people when I
got home my mom yelled at me for being
mean to my sister said she cried in a
room for a half hour because of how her
performance went I don't think it was a
big deal but okay like who asked
everybody else does so I want to know if
I'm the [ __ ] yes
I mean is there even any point to read
the comments
I don't know there is a certain
proportion of people are like
every Endeavor anyone ever does needs to
be met with this constructive criticism
but very very harsh constructive
criticism otherwise if they're not
subjected to The Crucible of mockery how
will they ever find the motivation to
get better bro
it's a community college voice class
okay they're not
they're not going straight from
Saint Lawrence College to Broadway okay
it's not this is not necessary in this
domain they're just having fun
I don't understand why
there's a place for that yeah there's a
people who think JK Simmons is the good
guy in Whiplash JK Simmons is the good
guy in Whiplash if you were needing
motivation to become the world's best
jazz drummer okay
it's a matter of perspective who the
good guy in Whiplash is
Miles Teller is also not the good guy in
Whiplash he chooses to make the deal
with the devil in order to get he
chooses to make the drumming more
important than anything else in his life
yeah the good guy is like the dude's Dad
I think I can't remember anyway
but it's like you know what it did not
to bring it back to this every stream
but it it always reminds me of like
imagine the Gathering it's like Friday
Night Magic you get your ass beat 2-0 in
the first round and then somebody's like
hey do you want to do a post-mortem of
what went wrong in the game and you're
like no that's okay
I'm just here to have fun not to be like
condescended to like I don't think it's
a rude thing to like show someone the
errors that they made but at the same
time it's like let's not pretend that
I'm here at Friday Night Magic to
eventually like get on the pro tour I'm
literally just playing
I'm just playing on curve I'm just
trying to pass some time if if
everything goes right maybe I'll go two
and two and I might win a pack or
something like that it's no big deal I
don't need the don't don't bother me
with the post mortem put the slide ruler
away exactly it's okay
if you enjoy it that's fine
I would rather like just talk not about
that I would rather be like hey what
brings you to Friday Night Magic because
it's pretty abnormal for like a 24 year
old single guy
to spend this Friday night at a card
shop and then I will learn about each
other as a
as a result of that and who knows maybe
we could find some common ground but I
don't need to just I'm also like I it it
was the post-mortems where I realized
that not everybody was playing the game
like me like as soon as I take a turn I
don't remember
what the turn was
and then um
when you you play against someone who's
actually good at Magic they're like here
let me reconstitute the exact board
State on turn three and you're like what
the you remember that that's taking up
space in your brain
and then when you tapped your Mountain
it gave you free Mana but that [ __ ] I'm
like I don't even remember doing that I
don't remember that in the slightest
I just remember scooping
you're the [ __ ] I teach theater at
the college level rule number one in my
class
you applaud everyone unless you're
explicitly meant to withhold Applause
correct
I mean I just obviously
you're the [ __ ] in the manner in
which you gave feedback also I feel like
sing better and don't be so nervous is
like not
that's not good feedback
like constructive feedback is like oh
make sure you like flex your diaphragm
for those high notes
be better is not that like people that
suck ass at giving criticism
if it's not actionable like what are you
supposed to what are you supposed to say
thank you for telling me like I suck
just be better
you're the ass I mean I don't really
need to look at this obviously she's the
[ __ ]
am I the answer [ __ ] for financially
contributing more to one child's life
this is like
the 50th post like this we've read and
it's always a little spicy
I love dude the
the similar to this post always makes me
laugh
like I I gotta figure out I've got to
reverse engineer how the number one most
similar post to this one is r slash
Volkswagen Golf GTI just hit 200 000
miles
maybe you bought his one of his kids
like a a car and not the other one
congratulations to you though no
disrespect
that is kind of sick though from two
years ago from dude February 25th 2020.
holy cow
they didn't know if you've seen the the
Tick Tock that's the guy sorry he's
running the other way he's running like
this
there's no other way we have to fix the
timeline
so I gotta do that one more time that
was looking kind of that was looking
like exactly the way I wanted it to look
there's no other way we have to fix the
timeline anyway
it's a great uh it's a great tweet
great tick tock
nice rear delts thanks I've been doing
absolutely no lifting except for lifting
up my child
but I do think like if you
um you know that old fable about the guy
who's like the cow was born and he holds
the cow
and then just over time he gets stronger
because the cow gets bigger a little bit
every day so he has to get a little
stronger to be able to lift the new way
to the I feel like if I just never put
my daughter down I could eventually
compete in like the world's strongest
man she's two so she's like I don't know
she's probably like 30 pounds or
something like that
and you don't just like lift you know
you like lift and then you hold and you
walk you're doing like a farmer's carry
and you're not doing it like 10 meters
you're doing it like for for two or
three kilometers sometimes
you're like let's go to the park you
take she's you're like do you want to go
in the stroller she's like no I want to
walk then you take two steps and she's
like Daddy pick me up make it make sense
make it make sense okay we could have
just got the stroller and had a nice
leisurely push to the park here but now
I gotta carry you the whole way
baited skill difference anyway sorry
sorry anyway I could be maybe I'll be
really strong
we have two kids Ava and Heather
so your kids are 30 they're in their 30s
you're old this better be a serious
problem
if this is an unforced error I'm going
to be very upset you're old you should
know better
about 12 years ago Ava got engaged to
her now husband we bought them a house
in our neighborhood and the next year
paid for their wedding
Heather has lived in a few different
cities taking different College Programs
she seems content to keep exploring
where her happy is and I think that's
great but
but
about 10 years ago different plots of
land came for sale in our neighborhood
we asked Heather which one she wanted
she thanked us for the thought but said
she didn't know where she wanted to be
and that we shouldn't buy land for her
we ended up buying a plot of land near
us we told her she again thanked us but
never made use of the land fast forward
and now Heather approaches us nervous
and asked if we would be able to help
her with a down payment for a house in
the city where she lives she was clear
she understood if that was not possible
this has caused an argument between
myself and my wife I would love to help
Heather but honestly we're in a
different Financial circumstances now
than we were before we're hoping to
retire soon and do not have a lot of
excess money my wife thinks that Heather
does not answer much and we've clearly
helped one child significantly more than
the other
Ava's wedding cost ten tens of thousands
of dollars and the house was obviously
hundreds of thousands she thinks she we
should sacrifice whatever we can to help
Heather to be clear we have the fine we
have financially helped Heather over the
years helped her with decorations when
she's moved
decorations
like
like Furniture okay
for with Furniture Etc I mean
decorations I'm like a house versus
decorations
it's like saying you bought the pizza on
moving day and you bought a house for
your other kid like that it just seems
like there's an order of magnitude
difference
I know it's not the same but I want to
be clear we're involved in both kids
lives I also know that Heather would be
uncomfortable if she knew us
contributing to her house was impacting
our retirement I think if we talked to
Heather openly about the differences in
our financial circumstances now and then
she would understand my wife wants to
sell the piece of land in our
neighborhood to give Heather the money I
don't really want to do that for a few
reasons including that I think Heather
would regret in the future because she
mentioned once or twice over the years
that she will want to move back home
when she's older prices for land here
have gone up significantly to be frank
nobody in our family could ever afford
to buy here or now in the future they're
Vancouver posting
am I the [ __ ] for not being able to
give Heather the down payment
I have been told I can edit
to provide more clarity Mel and I are
both women that seemed to cause some
confusion in the comments
that's not going to save you from the
ire of Reddit okay
you might have thought that that when
they thought it was an old man they were
like okay Boomer but now that they find
out that you're a woman they're gonna be
like oh come here come here sweetie you
might have even just made it harder on
yourself I don't know I'm not saying it
should be I'm just saying we know how it
goes on Reddit
rip DMS my inbox is full
I am not comfortable getting too
specific but over the years there have
been some unexpected health issues okay
there have been so the the medical bills
okay listen I take it at face value that
they're not in the same financial
situation that they were in the year
2009 or whatever like that happens
yo that guy just hit uh 100 000 miles on
his Kia too let's go
see you later warranty
oh man
hmm
Heather is a person who's incredibly
sensitive and kind most often to her own
detriment to a point where I think she
knows we would prefer her to live near
us and may not accept the sale of the
land because of it to be clear I'm open
to the sale of the land or transferring
it to Heather now it's just how to best
approach it so Heather doesn't feel
guilt moving forwards I think that were
I in Heather's shoes I would take the
house and just learn to live with the
guilt
I think that's where I'm at
I can't pretend to know exactly what
they're going through
but if the option if is to like not get
help with the down payment
or alternatively to get help with the
down payment but it forces my parents to
sell like listen okay
these posts I'm in danger of getting
like two econ pills okay but like I need
to see your portfolio of assets because
like if you have a house that you're
going to live in in retirement and then
you're like oh our retirement is going
to be a little tight and you also got
like a [ __ ] plot of land that's
supposedly worth a lot of money and
you're not doing anything with it why
don't you just sell the land
and use the money
I don't see the point can you not just
sell if it's worth so much money can you
not just like sell the land
and and you could you either have cash
or you have um you know uh like you put
it into a fixed income portfolio or
something like that to generate some
cash flow for you in retirement like I
don't understand what the
like if you are gonna struggle in
retirement but you own land you're not
using you're struggling like for no
reason I think although Maybe
you think it would be worth it if your
daughter one day was going to move in on
that land that's the only thing I could
think of
I just don't understand
that's what they said well yeah but I
mean then do it
[Laughter]
I don't know
they understand why they don't just like
I mean it's like an am I the [ __ ]
post that's like and I'm hungry should I
eat something like yeah probably I don't
know
like don't eat like a a grenade
or like broken glass or something should
I eat this broken glass no you should go
like eat some food but like
it's just I don't know it's a weird post
you're not the [ __ ] for like I mean
they're not an [ __ ] at all
they're not an [ __ ] for
buying one kid a house I know we go
through this now and then like in the
post there are people out there who are
and maybe they're right or at least they
have a lot of people who agree with them
there's people out there who are are
very fairness pills in the extent that
like if person a needs X and they
receive X from my parents even if I
don't have a use for X I also need to
receive X otherwise that's unfair
treatment I'm not I don't think at least
I'm that kind of person I haven't had to
deal with this situation in my life but
I feel like if you know your kids are
roughly the same age and one of them is
like hey this is where I'm going to live
and we're settling down and starting a
family it makes and you have the means
and the desire to help them out there
with the down payment and I guess also
paying for their wedding
that's good that doesn't mean that the
other person immediately needs to be
given the equivalent amount of like cash
or assets but I do
think that maybe they had the
expectation that when they finally chose
to settle down that same offer would be
on the table but things have changed
economically and financially for the
parents which I I don't know if there's
like a you snooze you lose precedent in
um you know the in the rule of law but
like things change like I'm I get that
it sucks that 10 years ago your sister
got a down payment on her house because
your parents were like super rich but
now like that's not the case anymore but
you still feel like you're owed a down
payment but like the the wheel of fate
is turned I guess
things things change in good ways and in
bad ways but I I do feel like I mean it
sounds like they bought the land
um like for her
why do you own so much land
why do you sorry
it's just it's like a i
but like
I don't know it's just strange okay
2008 was 12 years ago
no 2008 was
14 years ago
12 years ago we were on the start of the
hockey stick brother
2008 we're closing in on like 20 years
ago
I mean so they are indicated uh by
voting
by the way to be the [ __ ]
I don't know if I necessarily think
that's fair
but I do think that the comments could
be a little bit spicy
dude what are these posts
in the in the sidebar am I the [ __ ]
for serving alcohol to a recovering
addict
um
there's a pretty good chance I was if
you were familiar with this with their
situation I would say yeah
if you didn't know then no obviously not
anyway
I don't know this is like I
this post doesn't seem it doesn't seem
that spicy to me
I think you're the [ __ ] for paying
tens of thousands for Ava's wedding and
hundreds of thousands for Ava's house
but not putting aside or saving anything
close to that amount for Heather
am I oh listen
I just feel like
this strikes me as a perfect world
solution
in order to help one of your kids with a
down payment you have to have enough
money to
basically afford two down payments and
just put the other one in a savings
account for an infinite amount of time
like an amount of time that we don't
we don't know she could want a house in
like two years she could want a house in
like 50 years she could never want a
house
that seems crazy to me
yes why so that like a
35 year old adults feelings don't get
hurt
don't you just like get a clue bozo
[Laughter]
I'm calling the hypothetical adult child
in this situation of Bozo okay I'm not
calling you a bozo
just put it into an index fund that's
the problem you can't put money into an
index fund if you don't know where your
time Horizon is
it's impossible to you I mean you can
put it into like a a GIC or a CD
and get like Prime minus one or
something
yes you can
you remind it reminds me of every post
on like investing subreddits in 2021
I uh hey I have a little bit of money
for a down payment should I pop it into
the market for a year no absolutely not
um one year is not expected returns over
one year are incredibly uh volatile and
range from like minus fifty percent to
plus 300 percent hmm that seems good
I'll try that how you feeling now
you need to know your time Horizon in
order to and in order to get a
justifiable uh risk assessment
if she was like I want a house in eight
years then you'd be like okay I don't
know well maybe we'll put away like a 50
50 portfolio or something like that if
she's like I don't know when I'm gonna
want a house then what are you gonna do
with it you got to put it in a recurring
uh Donald renewing GIC and make like
last year you would have been making
like a quarter of one percent
it's not even worth going to the bank to
sign the paper
I don't I don't think the parents did
anything wrong
if anything they did like too much right
but they should probably sell the land
I don't think they should just leave
Heather the high and dry but at the same
time like uh
I mean if you have land I mean it's not
even just like a housing policy thing
like if you have land you own that
you're literally not using and you're
like I need money to solve my problem
my personal advice to you is to sell the
land in exchange for money
and then use that money to solve your
problems
I know is a radical solution
but at the same time
yeah also I think you have an obligation
to tell your 32 year old daughter to not
sign a 30-year
fixed rate mortgage although you know
what I guess she could refi later if if
the FED pivot actually comes to If the
Fed pivot actually comes to pass but
anyway okay I don't know I don't know
the police are here they're like sir we
want to give you the key to the city for
having such sane takes
what the heck is going on here giraffe
spotted
I'm clicking
you're the [ __ ] you ignored Heather
telling you she didn't want the plot of
land and bought it anyway now you yeah
but you still like you have the land
you know what I mean
it's only they lit the money on fire
like she doesn't want the land okay
sometimes I'm like I'm going out for
some lunch Kate do you want anything and
she's like no
buy it anyway bring it back if she
decides she doesn't want the pizza
there's two extra slices for Daddy
maybe it's not a metaphor that that
makes for in like an apt comparison but
you know they still have the land it's
not like the land is like deprecated
I get your financial situation has
changed but you have the power to do
things do the one thing your child has
asked for and you're saying no because
of a plot of land she didn't want still
doesn't want and may never want that is
true that's fair enough
I don't know like I I'm kind of I know
this makes me like not the champion of
chat but I do agree with this person
ironically in chat who said all these
people telling a parent they're an
[ __ ] because they bought their kid a
house I know it's like I'm I'm
struggling with it on like a like an
aristotlean level
how could doing a nice thing make you an
[ __ ]
because you didn't do a nice thing for
another person you're an [ __ ]
in if you hadn't bought anything for
anybody you would have been a nice
person but because you helped someone
when they needed help and didn't help
someone else at that exact same time
when you had the means you're the
[ __ ]
it's it just I don't know I'm I'm
struggling with it on like a
philosophical level
imagine if you bought a house for mouth
but not for Josh
well but like what if what if Josh
didn't want a house when I bought one
for mouth
and then 15 years later
Josh was like I'll take my house now and
I'm like nah dude I'm like retired I'm
on a fixed income
that would make you the [ __ ] I don't
think so I think if how could he be an
[ __ ] for giving someone a house
it doesn't seems
doesn't seem right it's the land they
should I think that they should sell the
land and give that money to their
daughter if that's the reason if they
were gonna give her the land to build a
house on or something to live close to
the parents uh this it sounds like it's
hey you can have one land's worth of
assets for free but only if you live
near us and that's a weird ultimatum to
give your adult children so that is like
I agree that's unreasonable but that's
not really what they're doing they're
just
I mean subtextually maybe that's what
they're hoping happens but
I don't think they're an [ __ ] for the
treatment of the daughters
like I think they're an [ __ ]
maybe if they choose not to sell the
land to help their other daughter
but the people that are like here's the
solution you shouldn't have bought the
house for your first daughter I'm like
what she didn't even do anything she's
literally just vibing she's just living
her life
now she she loses one house because
people on the internet are like they're
King Solomon pilled
sorry honey we can't help you with your
down payment because the internet says
we would have to take an exactly
equivalent amount of money and put it
into a savings account held uh in escrow
until an indeterminate time in the
future when your sister decides that she
wants a down payment for a house if she
even wants a down payment for a house
not to mention when they bought the
house for the because the market is and
the animals are leaving us the down
payment might be like the price more
than the price of the house for the
because I don't know if they live in a
rural area or something like that the
house might have been like they say
hundreds of thousands let's assume it
was 250 000 if she wants to buy a house
in a city then she could be like oh it
wouldn't have million dollars it's like
the down payment might be equivalent to
the price of the house for the kid in
the first place
um
they need to sit down with a financial
planner in like a mediator or something
I think the internet's being too
absolutist about this
you're the [ __ ] you're basically
punishing Heather for not wanting to
settle down at the same time but let's
do it
if
the Messiah
and one of the kids is like I'm ready to
settle down then you would be punishing
that kid if you didn't give them the
thing that you had the means or the
desire to give them until the other
sister was ready to settle down
it doesn't make any sense
just sell the land then you don't have
to deal with these insane people in the
comments
edited two days ago thanks for the
updates
as you stated in your post you gave Ava
hundreds of thousands while withholding
no money for her sister well you were
not obligated to help your children
equally helping one to the tune of
hundreds of thousands and the other to
zero must sting for Heather zero
you said zero
did you never hear the expression no
good deed goes unpunished I'm not saying
by the way that like there's not
anything that they could do to make the
situation better I'm not saying that the
that if this if this post is even real
I'm not saying that the op is the moral
High Ground
this is why you can't do anything for
anybody man
they get expectations
if they refuse to sell the land they
would be [ __ ] who you know what
drives me I'm just giving you squirts
you know what drives me crazy
in the post and maybe it's two different
people chasing on a monolith okay or two
different groups of people you know what
drives me crazy in the post where the
lady filmed the dude at a wedding and he
was dancing drunk and he said deleted so
many people were like she has no legal
right no legal he has no legal right to
demand that she take it down she would
be well within her legal rights to leave
it up and then here people I don't know
if it's the same people but in my head
it's the same people because I feel like
that's how the human brain works because
I'm getting it from the same Source
people are like well they have no legal
right to sell the land they shouldn't be
forced to sell the land but yet at the
same time if they don't do it they're
the [ __ ] make up your [ __ ] make
up your [ __ ] mind okay make up your
[ __ ] mind
it's not about is this legal is this
illegal
you know you know what else is driving
me crazy people are like
you wouldn't know what it's like because
you don't have a sibling okay
you maybe you're too [ __ ] biased
because you do have a sibling
maybe you need an only child to look at
this situation and tell you actually
like younger kids being a little bit of
a baby like grow up
maybe you need the clarity that comes
from with an only child okay
also get a personality you wouldn't
understand what it's like you don't have
a brother okay
you wouldn't understand what it's like
to be allergic to Stone fruits Don't
Mess Lord hath no fury like a streamer
who has a stone fruit allergy who was
born in November
like don't you can't appeal to
familiarity you need to have like a
rhetorical
you need to build evidence and and a
point to be persuasive you can't just be
like if you had a brother you'd
understand or maybe I [ __ ] wouldn't
maybe I'd be like hey congrats on the
house bro
would be nice like I'm making mortgage
payments right now but congrats on your
house
maybe I'll be furious maybe I'd be happy
for him I don't know
like I'm I'm trying to construct like an
analogous situation
what if your parents said they would pay
for your college okay you have two
siblings let's even say they're twins
let's say one of them is Channing Tatum
in 21 Jump Street and the other one is
uh Jonah Hill in 21 Jump Street so one
of them's a dumb is a bag of hammers and
then the other one's pretty smart Okay
so they're both gonna go to college
they pay for Channing Tatum's College
okay
because he's not getting any
scholarships on his lessons for soccer
but Jonah Hill did so well in high
school he's got a full ride are the
parents the [ __ ] if they don't give
the cash value of what they spent on
Channing Tatum's education to Jonah Hill
is a gift
there's so many yeses and I'm like I'm I
don't know man I'm in like the no camp
I mean they worked for the money
they're punishing what are they
punishing him for he had a safe house to
live in warm the healthy meals every
night good uh parental role models a
scaffolding that allowed him to excel in
something that he was good at
I would be annoyed if I worked my ass
off for a full scholarship and then my
parents gave my underachieving sibling a
hundred thousand dollars for free
without giving him a hundred thousand
dollars they're giving an American
college a hundred thousand dollars
if they gave him a hundred thousand
dollars and then said please give this
to the university you'd never see the
money again
also I think if you were like oh I
worked so hard and all I got was a free
ride to a good school what a waste of my
time maybe you're not as smart as you
think you are maybe you shouldn't insert
yourself into this metaphor because I'm
not talking about you I'm talking about
Jonah Hill
he was valedictorian
I'm glad I clicked on this one I said
these are always spicy
I mean they have the right to feel yeah
I think that's fair I think the younger
sibling has the right to feel embittered
for sure
but I'm also like I don't know like
I don't know if it's because I am a
parent but I'm like I'm willing to pay
for this thing that you need
if they were like I don't need it
anymore can I still have the money
the answer might be yes but the all the
answer might also be like no because
then I could retire like eight months
earlier
I would be like congratulations that you
don't need this thing that I was willing
to pay for but now that you now that you
don't need it I'm going to keep that
money for myself because like I worked
for it and then I can use that to have a
slightly longer retirement and spend my
golden years in Comfort with my spouse
like I would be annoyed if I said I
would pay for my kids University and
then they got a full scholarship and
then they got mad at me for not giving
them like 80 grand
I would be like do you know how much
money I spent on raising your ass
are you crazy
where do you where do you get off
demanding that's I'm proud of you for
doing so well in high school don't get
me wrong but at the same time like
you're like oh it okay so next time I'll
just do worse in school and then make
you pay eighty thousand dollars to UBC
and I'll be like okay fine if you gotta
next time
okay go ahead yeah do you you go ahead
and get me next time
if we both get reincarnated into the
same familial relationship again
I took a 15-minute trip to the library
you're still on this one what'd you do
at the library for 15 minutes
you check in your email
was returning a book
ah that makes sense that's a good point
it's kind of a ridiculous question 15
minutes is pretty reasonable I guess now
that I think about it sorry I was I
started pre-tilted
[Laughter]
you know it's like I don't know at least
the metaphor it would be better to argue
the case rather than argue the metaphors
because the metaphors kind of fall apart
I guess that because what I was going to
say is it's like oh
um well it's oh
now they're doing student loan relief
where's my ten thousand dollars even
though I paid off my loans but then it's
more like hey
we're doing student loan relief right
now and then if you like three years
you're like yes student loan relief I
love it and then like three years later
you're like
can I get some now and the government
was like no absolutely not we have a
we're running a huge deficit we're in a
recession right now I guess you would be
like no you could at least be mad about
it
if you were happy for other people to
get the debt relief and then you get the
you have the same need later and then
you need the debt relief but they're not
going to give you the debt relief I
guess I could understand that
I could understand being annoyed that
doesn't mean that they're in the wrong
for doing a nice thing for the people
that came before you that doesn't
necessarily immediately benefit you
anyway I don't know we got we got lost
in the Weeds on this one I just need to
I need to see the the parents asset
breakdown
I feel like they might have like
like 17 plots of land and they're like
we're a little cash poor right now
sell some of your land
no please help me budget my family is
starving
hold on I'm scrolling
am I the [ __ ] for telling my kids to
borrow money from their sister not me
this is like the it's family money again
[Laughter]
it's another family money issue
okay
I can't believe it
I have four kids card and they're all
like adult kids again
four kids Carmen Eliza
Michael and Andrew Carmen and Michael
are both lower middle class Carmen is a
single mom of two and works as a nurse
Michael and his wife are teachers and
expecting their first child Carmen makes
one hundred thousand dollars Michael and
his wife make a little over one hundred
thousand combined and live in California
near the bay area where a hundred
thousand dollars is considered low
income okay fair enough
Eliza is a nanny for an extremely rich
family I don't know if she's considered
living because she lives in a separate
house but it's on the same property she
makes 250 000 a year plus bonuses
doesn't pay rent or utilities rarely
buys groceries because she always eats
with the family they bought her a brand
new car they pay for her gas maintenance
all of her medical dental vision at
first I was like it sounds like she's a
servant then I was like what the hell
I gotta go to Nanny school man this is
crazy
it's like
there's no the salary is great but then
the bennies are like you literally have
to pay for nothing
hell they even pay for her gym
membership and her vacations what is she
what does she spend money on
that's all of the things that you buy
your savings account is going out of
control man this is this is crazy
she's worked for them for two years two
years
I thought that [ __ ] would be like 15
year literally she's been there since
2020.
and recently bought a rental building in
cash needless to say she's doing very
well for herself and
she bought the building in cash
no seven percent mortgage holy cow
she's a landlord yeah but she's girl
bossing so it's okay
foreign
I think it's I'm willing listen she's
not really a landlord first off she's a
landlady
I think that makes it better secondly if
she is a landlord one rental building
maybe she's like a land Earl
on the on the scale of Lord she's not
like a a land Emperor you know she's not
like Lee kashing or something like that
she's just she's like a little Earl or
like a like a petty duke or something
like that
it's not that bad it starts with one
building
you don't know why anyway sorry
yeah Kick-Ass duke or something
Michael and Andrew just asked me for
money
Michael needs 30k for part of a down
payment for a townhouse and Andrew wants
10K so he can graduate with no debt
I told them to ask Eliza for money not
me and she could easily afford to help
them out
Eliza called me the other day asking
what I said to her brothers because now
they're both asking her for money I told
her what I told him and she yelled at me
for volunteering her to help her with
her brother's expenses
I told her that I never said she would
help them I just said that she easily
could she said she doesn't feel
comfortable loaning money to family
because she doesn't want to risk their
relationship if they don't pay her back
I told her it shouldn't be a big deal if
they don't pay her back because we know
her Christmas bonus will be close to
double what her brothers want okay yeah
you're the [ __ ] like you can't I get
that
Eliza
maybe has more means to loan money to
the family but you can't just volunteer
her her income like she's maybe her
Christmas bonus will be more than the
brothers asked for but like she worked
for her Christmas bonus even if it is
more than I don't want to say it's more
than she deserves but you know what I
mean
that you can't just be like oh you can
afford it yeah but I don't like want to
afford it
like with no disrespect
like of course you could just give them
like thirty thousand dollars but at the
same time like
what's in it for her she she did the
work
I don't understand
like they didn't without being super
disrespectful she didn't they didn't do
anything
I don't understand
being a good sibling how do you know
they're a good sibling they could have
hate they hated each other when they
were kids
who knows
what's Eliza's at I know man holy cow
she should be teaching like Instagram
classes on how to be a live-in nanny
although on the other hand why would she
ever do anything else when she's got the
greatest job of all time to a quarter
million dollars a year never have to pay
any bills all your vacations are paid
for oh so there's no job security though
it only lasts 18 consecutive years
foreign
anyway
um maybe it doesn't last 18 years maybe
people fire their nannies like when they
the kids become like adolescents or
whatever I don't know but
I told her it wouldn't be a big deal if
they don't pay her back because we know
where Christmas bonus will be close to
double what her brothers want plus if
she says no she could potentially risk
her relationship with her brothers
because she can afford it she hung up on
me it hasn't spoken to me since so I
want to know if I'm the [ __ ] yeah
you're the I get that you're a family
but like you can't just volunteer
someone else's money and then if someone
else if the person you volunteer says uh
I don't want to risk the relationship by
loaning family money you don't get to
say well yeah but you make that much
money at your job anyway so who cares
not to mention like I know this is again
it's obvious that she's the [ __ ] to
me to begin with but then without
getting too much into the weeds you know
she's got to like pay income tax on her
income and then loan the after-tax
income to her family so like
in order to because she's pulling down
like nearly top tax bracket money in
order to loan forty thousand dollars to
her family she's got to bring in like 70
something
it's a pretty substantial burden to just
impose on somebody because you think
they can handle it even when they're not
really involved in this situation
she has no expenses
yeah but it's her money
I don't understand what the
why are why are her siblings entitled to
her money
I don't get it
it depends on the urgency of the
situation well like
getting a ten thousand dollar loan so
you can graduate debt free
that's not debt-free you've just changed
who you owe the money to
like that doesn't make any sense to me I
get I mean honestly I would think that
if I was in Eliza's situation that would
be a gimme I'll tell you what I'll give
you the 10 grand so you don't have to
pay you know Fannie Mae eight percent
interest on your student loans or
whatever and then you just pay me the 10
grand back you know like
500 a month for however long it takes
maybe that's a little the the repayment
terms might be a little bit High there
but you know it's just not the top of my
head
zero interest that's pretty good
a zero interest debt is a zero interest
loan is incredible you know a seven
percent interest loan
uh the doubles every 10 years so if your
loan is for 10 years essentially you've
paid back double of what you took out in
the first place zero percent that's
that's merciful
I can understand not wanting
to loan family money but I mean like
here's the thing I think if she is
she's lucky in life
this I want to preface this by saying
she doesn't have to do this
if she doesn't want to loan
her family money
she could just give them the money with
the pretense that's like I I wouldn't
want to do alone with my family because
if you didn't pay it back it could screw
up our relationship but if you have the
means
here's the money as a one-time gift a
one-time gift no guilt no resentment
don't ever mention it again it's okay
it's the least I could do but it's also
the most I could do don't ask me for
anything ever again
but I also don't think she and moreover
I think it would be different if like
um if your sibling call and as an only
child here I can't put myself in their
shoes obviously but
if your sibling called you and was like
Hey I'm really embarrassed to ask you
this but could you help me with the down
payment for my house is 30 grand it
would really help us out a lot blah blah
blah
that I might be more amenable and be
like you know what like maybe we can
find a way to make it work but if they
were like hey mom told me that you would
loan me thirty thousand dollars I would
be like
like hang up the phone right now
because that's like you gotta present
things in a more acceptable package than
that like that's that's it it matters
like how you approach someone for an
interaction you know
but I mean like more than anything else
I'm like
like it's her money it's very rude
and maybe rudeness is not the top
priority here but it's I think it's very
rude to be like
your sister will give you the money she
can afford it like that's just I mean
she did the work
and she we should win the lottery of
jobs yeah but like
so what I guess
she didn't have the kids yeah they're
not her they're not her kids
I don't understand why she should feel
compelled to make sure that all of her
siblings are made equal
being a leech to a one percenter isn't a
job no is a damn dream
it's like heaven that's the streamer
like retirement plan
get one fan who is like the son of the
CEO of like some kind of
oil company and then just like ride off
into the sunset
why doesn't she share the dream a little
bit
honestly like I mean I'm we're all
projecting here I feel like it's kind of
because they came to where and said mom
said you'd give us some money don't be
like a b word about it
also like I don't know how close they
are either like
like if you're if you grew up with your
siblings and you were like tight and you
were like uh you know you're you're not
six individuals you're one family like
that's one thing
it doesn't sound like this is the case
there's some families where it's like
there's two parents and then every one
of the kids has like a one-to-one
relationship with the parental units and
they don't really talk to the siblings
at all like
I mean like if you're
sister won like a real Lottery
if she won
50 million dollars in the Powerball or
whatever
I would be like buy me a house
I wouldn't ask for the down payment I
would ask for the whole thing in cash
I would expect and and listen and maybe
I don't get a house I'll live with it
like I'm not gonna not gonna blow
everything up just so I don't get it but
like if you won 50 million dollars and
if if one of my very very close like if
my mom my dad
my wife or my daughter or a sibling
hypothetically won 50 million dollars in
the lottery I would say buy me a house I
would I would drop some hints at the
very least
if they were making 250 000 a year I
don't think I would feel entitled it's a
lot of money don't get me wrong but
and they're just asking for a down
payment but still
like it's a it's a lot of money but it's
not like hey so much money that I'm
gonna take care of like all of my
siblings and my parents in perpetuity
probably
if I won 50 million dollars in the
lottery
I'm trying to think here
well now it's like am I the [ __ ]
I won 50 million dollars in the lottery
and I bought a house for all of my
friends who don't have houses but now my
friends who bought houses think that
they're being punished by not getting a
free house oh if I'd known you were
going to win the lottery and give
everyone a free house I wouldn't have
paid for my house
you [ __ ]
can you just give me the cash value of a
house instead
you've made Seven other people's lives
better and yet you haven't made my life
better you're a bad person
on ironically yes give them the cash
you're an insane person listen that was
too far in Minecraft
I don't think adults should think like
that
you're you got your house
you're okay
you got a roof over your head you're
handling your bills why is it if
somebody else is struggling and they get
like a handout why should you get it why
should you stick your hand out as well
maybe I buy you like a car or something
buy you like like your favorite car like
a Dodge Charger or something like that
but
yes it was men as an insult
I don't know it just seems crazy to me
who says being in a house and negates
all their problems well who says like if
I buy a house for you know person X who
doesn't have a house that that is making
their life perfect as well
why do you feel like you oh you get your
own something
I mean I'm I'm trying hard to like
reconcile this with with my political
beliefs
because it sounds like a a huge Boomer
take but we're talking specifically
about a situation of like
if I won the lottery
and I have 10 friends three of them have
houses if I bought houses for the seven
friends who don't own a house and the
other three friends are like where's the
cash value of the house that you owe me
to be friends like to to have treated us
all fairly then like [ __ ] you're not
friends anymore
you did a nice thing for someone else
you didn't do anything for me
I'm being punished for for purchasing a
house in 2015. it's only gone up 70 in
value with me doing [ __ ] nothing
what are you talking about
yes but I'm Petty oh well that's fair I
think that's fine
it's a made-up scenario anyway
you're equating friends to children it's
a false equivalency what are you talking
about they're not children they're
they're siblings
I know we got stunmarked on the other
one for a reasonable length of time but
like I don't know
they're all adults
I mean I'm not I'm resisting the urge
to say why don't they just
get why don't they out competeer for her
job
it's a free market
why don't you show up an hour earlier
than she shows up why don't you stay an
hour later why don't you
cut the demand for your salary why don't
you say you're paying her 250 I'll take
200 and they'll pay for my own dentist
appointments
out compete her and then maybe see if
she likes to win the shoes on the other
foot but also why don't you then go
ahead and see when she asks you for
thirty thousand dollars how you feel
that she's already spent the money that
you worked for
you might find that when the thing in
the prestige is that Hugh Jackman never
knows when he gets into the tube if he's
going to be the one that's on the stage
or if he's going to be the one that's in
the tube okay
okay
anyway
Mo Money Sunday from the doordash
subreddit
I'm gonna go to the bathroom I gotta pee
really bad I'm not sure if that came
across Let Me Go slash marker react
Court



yeah we're back with react cord because
Rumble verse doesn't work anymore and
the world is a cold dead place or
whatever hey am I the [ __ ] for
telling my wife she can stay home this
Thanksgiving
the jury is spoken and they say you are
the [ __ ]
my wife is a grade A Plus
that wife guy spotted a grade A Plus
wife dude me too picky eater oh no oh he
he buried the lead it's bothersome to a
certain degree but on holidays basically
the [ __ ] show begins she refuses to eat
certain meals and mom would take it
personally which results in a series of
arguments between them as a compromise
this year my wife offered to bring her
own food to Thanksgiving dinner I was
stunned I asked if she thought this
through and she looked at me confused I
told her about how weird it would be to
bring her own food especially when she
wouldn't be sharing it with anybody else
and told her to think about how my mom
would react
she'd get very offended and upset my
wife said it's not her problem she was
just trying to make it work by bringing
her own meal I told her not again wait I
told her again that mom might not like
nor even allow this there is something
very and this is probably not the point
of the post but when a man who's
presumably an adult
calls his mom mom in the post instead of
my mom or my mother
that just feels wrong it feels like the
post is written by it's like a an email
written from one sibling to another
like she's not our mom stop calling her
mom I
even when I talk to my wife I never just
say mom even though she knows I'll be
talking about my mom I always say my mom
will be here you know blah blah blah
I don't just say Mommy's coming
it's just it's just strange
I told her again mom might not like this
nor even allow this she blew up at me
asking if I want her to either eat food
she doesn't like or go hungry I
suggested she give my mom's food a
chance but she says it wasn't about my
mom's cooking she just doesn't like
certain foods we had an argument I ended
up telling her she she could she could
stay home this Thanksgiving and have
whatever meal she likes she got quiet
then lashed out at me calling me
insensitive and negative to say this to
her I repeatedly asked her to calm down
oh
husband of the year
uh that that should do the trick
but she couldn't stop ranting about how
I was basically willing to exclude her
from a major event she started cold
shouldering dude women are always like
this
you have an argument things get personal
you know the husband says something over
the line and then she's like doesn't
want to talk to me for some reason
what's up with that
she started cold shouldering me about it
well at the same time guilting me saying
I'm treating her poorly after she
offered the perfect compromise
and so update by the way
my wife has decided to spend
Thanksgiving with her family who by the
way live hours away so this means
unnecessary travel expenses you know
seeing your family unnecessary seeing my
family a sacred event that you can't
even bring your own food to
instead it basically ditched me for a
whole week y'all happy now y'all happy
Reddit you did this to me though I
appreciate some insightful comments on
the situation some others not so much
especially with the assumptions claiming
my wife has allergies she does not stop
trying to take the side of my life
partner
you all get that from but anyway it's
all good now I guess though I'm not too
thrilled with her decision I feel like
she's doing it despite me or get me to
cave in bro she doesn't like care about
you like at all right now
she's not part of the fight anymore she
has sidestepped the fight and she's
living her best life
this is not the right way to handle this
situation at all am I the [ __ ] yeah
cause like it just why what's wrong with
her bringing her own food to
Thanksgiving
like it's it's a holiday but it's just a
meal like Thanksgiving is not like a
sacred religious feast or anything like
that it's just uh you eat some turkey
you there's some mashed potatoes you
watch football
I brought my own food to Thanksgiving I
was a vegetarian I went to Thanksgiving
I brought some frozen samosas and I ate
the frozen samosas
I mean I cooked them for I didn't eat
them straight out of the freezer but
like
I just don't understand
is rude to the host I don't think so
everybody hated you no the event they
kind of taunted me a little bit oh you
want some of this turkey and I was like
nah man this samosas are acceptable but
it's family
just can't he just like text his mom and
be like hey you know my wife's gonna
bring samosas this year I don't
understand the the problem she doesn't
want to share
like so what
listen like sharing is good but you
don't have to do it
like you don't have to bring enough food
for the rest of the class
if everybody else like I don't
understand why it's rude to anybody else
at the Thanksgiving dinner
I've never been at Thanksgiving and have
somebody bring their own food and been
like oh man I'm so unhappy I'm eating
turkey gravy mashed potatoes sweet
potatoes green beans corn dinner rolls
butter pumpkin pie sparkling apple cider
red wine uh like it's it's a it's a damn
Feast man
you're gonna you're gonna be the kind of
guy that shows up to a feast and you're
like oh she brought that baloney
sandwich looks freaking Choice man did
you bring 16 baloney sandwiches for the
rest of the people here
just doesn't make any sense to me
I I mean I just don't see what the wife
did wrong here at all
like okay she do I think it's a little
bit crazy that she's a picky eater and
can't eat anything at Thanksgiving which
is like I mean most people are not picky
eaters about like you know turkey or
mashed potatoes
or corn or like bread at least in the
U.S okay
I can't speak for the rest of the world
it is a little odd
but like if she's if her choices are you
know go-to Thanksgiving and be
um unhappy
and shove food that she doesn't like in
her face to placate this guy's mother I
guess what I'm trying to say and it all
it comes back to this a lot
when you marry someone
while you're married you got to be in
your spouse's camp
instead of your parents Camp except for
situations that are truly insane you
can't side with your mom by default over
your spouse like that's you had a whole
ceremony about it
you put rings on each other's fingers
like do you the husband
agreed to sever the relationship that
you have with your parents still keep it
but but sever the sacred tie and
transfer that tie to somebody else do
you are you putting are do you consent
to add a new number one to your Myspace
Circle okay
so like I don't understand why I mean I
feel like if I was in this situation I
would be and my mom was being weird
about it I'd be like hey Mom listen I
know it was [ __ ] weird that she
doesn't eat like turkey and mashed
potatoes but at the same time if you
wanted to come to Thanksgiving and not
be uncomfortable then uh you know she's
got to bring her own food and if my mom
was like no then I'd be like well I
can't come to Thanksgiving this year
maybe we'll try it again next November
because like it just seems like uh
I mean it's just it I my take is that
it's not a big deal for her to bring her
own food what would make her an [ __ ]
if she was like don't cook turkey and
mashed potatoes don't cook the food you
normally cook for Thanksgiving instead
cook something else for everybody to eat
that I that only I want
if she was like can't we just order four
pepperoni pizzas this year and put
mayonnaise on top of them then you would
be like holy cow she'd be like Reddit
Enemy Number One but like if she is like
I don't want to eat this and she brought
her own food then who cares
it's not that big of a deal
so I would say yes he's the [ __ ]
and it's I'm doubling down and going
like I'm going [ __ ] squared because
he made an update and I don't know how
like maybe this is a day later maybe six
hours later if like you're the [ __ ]
and then your emotions come down and
you're like I was the [ __ ] thanks
Reddit that's one thing but if you're
the [ __ ] and then like eight hours
later you're still you're like even more
mad about it than you were before then
like you you're [ __ ] squared and I
don't give out that verdict very often
you're like you're you got to give
yourself you got to take a deep breath
you got to count to ten and then you
gotta recognize you have some like a
look inside of you and say you know I'm
the problem with this situation I'm
going to apologize and even if I
apologize it might not make it right
straight away but we'll like work
towards it in the future I don't
understand that it's it seems crazy
you're the [ __ ] she offered a
compromise my wife's family does the
Feast of The Seven Fishes I have never
heard of this in my life but that I'm a
big fish guy I hate fish so since I
joined the family it's the Feast of the
seven fishes and the chicken we all get
a good laugh and my mother-in-law is
happy to make it for me
Feast of The Seven Fishes
is it seven different fishes or is it
just seven like of the same fish
there's seven different fish courses
that sounds kind of sick honestly
I love fish
I love and honestly
the fishier the better I know I've said
it before
one of the reasons my wife and I have
have a good relationship when we order
sushi you know sometimes you get the the
ones that are like fishy they're like
mackerel
she passes me her mackerel
Ladies Choice you want you give me two
pieces of macro you want my salmon you
want my tuna I'm kind of bored with the
tuna at this point I know everyone's
like oh you know the tuna is so good
oh my favorite Sushi Toro I love Toro
okay then you take my Toro
go ahead
and I'll take your mackerel I love that
fish oil man
you know what it listen we're going to
Sushi build Toro is fine it's not it's
not bad it's just I'm kind of over it
negatoro oh man when they mince the tuna
and then they mix it with the radish and
put some a little like sliced green
onions on top oh man
[Laughter]
now we're talking
anyway
I think he's the [ __ ]
um she offered yeah right we did this
one the Feast of the seven fishes and
the chicken you're the [ __ ] for not
standing up for your wife she's trying
very hard to make the holidays work for
your family but you only care about your
mommy's feelings capital M doing psychic
damage to the op for sure if your mother
is so thin-skinned she can't handle the
idea that people have different dietary
needs she doesn't get the host parties
well she does she just gets to only
invite insane people your update makes
you absolutely the [ __ ] hundreds of
people are telling you you need to
support your wife and you got angry that
she's going to go to her family who does
support you man you are a terrible
husband usually I'm like
you can't read that much into it but I
would say this might be a rare exception
I don't know if it's true but he's
definitely playing the role of a
terrible husband
she came up with a solution to endure
the hell that is being around your
mother okay now this did the mother do
anything in the post
except cook the Thanksgiving feast I get
the idea that like it seems like the
mother is uh you know what because the
sun is like oh mom might not like it but
the sun might just be like a big puss
honestly
okay I don't want to tell my mom
something that might disappoint her you
know the mom he might text his mom and
be like she's going to bring samosas to
Thanksgiving and Mom would be like let's
go you know
you told her you were too scared of
mommy to even allow your wife to suggest
finding a solution God mommy is so scary
when she told you you were insensitive
to her legitimate problem you told her
to calm down ugh women right come on
dude you should be thankful your wife
isn't picky about the man she marries oh
man
no that last sentence made me spit out
my coffee I can't op you're the [ __ ]
user received Reddit this for this post
info has your mother attempted to okay
listen we know this there's no
controversy here this this person is
they're out of line okay
am I the [ __ ] for kicking a girl I
didn't know out of my wedding hey
matters of Darkness thanks for the
gifted subscriptions thank you
thank you
I mean it depends on the situation if
they're like a plus one and you kick
them out because you don't know them
like that's the
that's the that's what a plus one is if
you knew who they were that their answer
would be like invited
if they broke into your reception and
were like stealing food out of the trays
or something like that this is a
different story but uh anyway
um
okay pop it down here my husband and I
both 27 got married a few weeks ago he's
obviously still upset about it but I
don't think I was listen we got to work
on our writing skills here he's not
upset about the wedding he's upset about
this incident that happened at the at
the wedding
we only gave plus ones to married
couples or if we knew this significant
other well why does this come up so
often you have so much to already worry
about like at your own wedding it's a
it's way too much work for some [ __ ]
that is like five to six hours long with
the ceremony plus the reception it takes
like months for most people to plan why
Complicated by being like I'm gonna draw
a delineating line on every single guest
I mean like yeah that's also valid I I
get that it's more expensive but like if
you you either got to give like no plus
ones or you got to give a plus one to
everyone that you invite
and if you [ __ ] worry about the price
just get married at City Hall and then
like go out to Coyote Ugly or something
afterwards like you can see I don't
understand I get that it's expect also
the husband and a wife is not plus one
that they're one unit when you send the
wedding invitation
to a person if they have a spouse and
it's not like a an incredibly small
intimate wedding that it's an implicit
plus one it always says like to Mr and
Mrs
Levinson Gould you know
anyway
I was a plus one at a wedding when I was
um
it was probably 19. I had never met the
the bride nor the groom in my entire
life I went to the ceremony
paid my Penance paid my dues sitting
there for 45 minutes watching two
strangers I've never seen and have never
seen again get married in a church I've
never been to
I have no idea what happened to their
marriage since but then I ate a pretty
nice meal in an outdoor heated tent and
ripped up the open bar
like it was going out of style
I and I think I have an obligation to
pay it forward okay if I'm gonna invite
if I'm gonna invite a single person or a
person that's in a casual relationship
to my wedding if I respect the person
enough to invite them to see me at my
most vulnerable and intimate then sure
they can bring someone along as well for
the ride I don't want them to have to be
the third wheel to married couples like
this [ __ ] is like just [ __ ] weird
anyway
we only gave plus ones to married
couples if we knew or if we knew the so
well my husband has one childhood friend
that was coming from out of state to
attend I met him a bunch but only his
girlfriend of three years a few times
because of the distance I didn't want to
give him a plus one but my husband he's
been dating this girl for three years
and you didn't want to give him a plus
one like that's
that's you're getting pretty serious
and you met her yeah like she's not a
stranger
please tell me this isn't the woman that
got kicked out of the of the party
I didn't want to give him a plus one but
my husband begged since he was traveling
and didn't know anyone else at the
wedding and he didn't want him to be
uncomfortable or have to travel alone I
said fine just to make him happy flash
forward to the reception I see him with
some girl I've never seen before I asked
husband what was up he told me his
friend and his girlfriend broke up a few
days before the wedding since he had
already rsvp'd us too he brought a
friend with him I was pissed since I
made an exception for him and didn't
want anyone random at my wedding I had
one of the Bridesmaids go to him and
tell him he could stay but can his date
please go back to the hotel this is a
private event you're crazy you've lost
your mind
you're out of control
you realize you know it sounds like
you're probably spending upwards of 10
grand on this wedding what is this one
extra guess going to cost they already
they already bought the food
I don't understand what the what's the
issue they're already there the damage
is if there's any damage and I wouldn't
consider it damage in the first place
the damage is already done
he said okay and didn't make a fuss but
he left with her and didn't come back I
thought on everything I thought
everything was fine and had a great
night my husband found out the next day
and we got in an argument he's mad
because his friend traveled and I kicked
him out without talking to him I didn't
kick him out just as they
is this what we call a bridezilla
now it's a few weeks later my husband
still brings it up from time to time and
his friend hasn't been answering his
texts I kind of feel bad because but but
it was my wedding I didn't want any
strangers there yes yes the [ __ ]
of course
I mean if somebody broke into your
wedding
and then um like was eating food out of
the cloche or something like that or are
you taking a handful of wedding cake
then yeah you can kick them out but like
kicking out your guess plus one is a
little crazy
I don't understand I just I also don't
understand why she did it I also don't
understand what the hell is going on in
this r slash
fuse box games
post on the sidebar but I'm very
uncomfortable well now you know how I
felt when you kissed Eddie and it's two
cartoon ladies
hanging out in like a cabana
I don't know
I don't know I've seen enough mobile
game advertisements to know uh I think
what happens next
I don't know
I'll go check it out and let you know
okay thank you thank you
you're the [ __ ] what is that what
yeah no I mean like I already gave my
verdict so we'll read the comments here
but
I mean I just don't understand like it's
not just like that's like something you
shouldn't do but like why are you
worried about that like it's your
wedding just chill out
it's like trying to like you're on a
train it's already left the station and
you're like oh no
like I wanted to actually upgrade my
seat it's like this [ __ ] is in motion
baby
you got to just sit back and and pull
out like the iPad or something like that
you just gotta relax as much as you can
and then later be like you know talk to
your husband and be like I can't believe
that he brought a new girl when we said
we weren't gonna have plus ones and then
your husband would be like yeah I know
I'll talk to him about it and he would
never text him but you would at least
feel like you guys are on each other's
team right like
just let them be at the wedding and then
save your insane complaint for after
when he can no longer tell you what he
really thinks about it because you're
joined you're joined in holy matrimony
and there's a there's a balance to all
this stuff
a spouse is somewhat you you don't do
Insane things
you think in saying things and then you
tell them to your spouse later
you know I don't hit people with my car
but sometimes I come home from driving
and I was like I should have hit them
with my car and she's like yeah well no
but and that's the way it goes that's
what keeps this Blue Marble spinning
okay
I tell you guys about it too that is
true
yeah okay well you're the [ __ ] what
is the actual harm of them being there
at that point he had a plus one it's
unlikely he knew you gave him a
dispensation on your special day this
comes off as power hungry I'm telling
you it's bridezilla you're a ginormous
[ __ ] you're the [ __ ]
man
you were so concerned about making the
wedding perfect for yourself that you
ruined it for your husband you're the
[ __ ]
science is all about Coulda not Shoulda
you were so concerned about whether or
not you could
forgot to consider whether or not you
should one of the most finest
microgeneticists the world has ever
known and he spared no expense Jimmy
you gave him a plus one and he used it
then you were rude and revoked it during
the reception his plus one also did
nothing wrong Sorry Brad zilliba you're
the [ __ ] it's non-controversial okay
it's non-controversial we move on let's
get into some some slight controversy

rudeness right there
hmm
how am I uh am I the [ __ ] for letting
my mother have a copy of the key to our
new home despite my wife's subjection
let's see
dude I hate this similar to this post
sidebar number one post blatant misogyny
like that's the name of the suburb I'm
assuming it's not glorifying it I'm
assuming it's making fun of it but still
just someone sends something horrible to
them on DM because I made a post about
how my husband ordered me a pizza
come on
I am I the [ __ ] for letting my mother
have a copy of the key to our new home
despite my wife's objections
I recently bought a one-story house note
that it was purchased solely by me my
wife did not help me save for it I
started saving for it before I even met
her and it's in my name we'll see how
the courts feel about that one
when my parents threw us a party for
this happy occasion
mom asked for a copy of the key in case
of an emergency I let her have it which
made my wife upset she didn't say
anything at the time but she waited till
we were alone and started arguing with
me saying I shouldn't have let my mother
have a copy of the key I said why since
my mother is known to respect privacy
and is a very trusted member of the
family she said she doesn't feel
comfortable with the idea of someone
else who's not a resident having a copy
of the key she also brought up how my
mother didn't pay a penny towards the
house oh here we go I can tell where
this is going already that the the male
urge to own someone in a conversation
against your own best interests I felt
it as soon as he wrote that his wife
said his mom didn't contribute to the
financial well where with all of the
house I was like here it comes she
didn't either it's just something in the
masculine brain that is like I can land
the shot here I can score some points
with the judges
so this should disqualify her from
getting the key I said it wasn't a big
deal but she kept persisting saying I
need to take oh well maybe it's just me
actually
um saying I need to take the key back
quite frankly this had me fuming I
pointed out that I'm the one who bought
the house and it's my decision to decide
who gets a copy of the key end of story
she screamed at me saying that
technically she did contribute to the
house savings back when she used to pay
for our rent and daily expenses while I
saved money bro
I saved all this money look you decided
to pay for all of our bills
and our rent out of the goodness of your
heart
that has nothing to do with my ability
to save money that's are you stupid
you're crazy
well look at the on the one hand shirt
maybe it doesn't matter if she didn't
pay for the house considering they're
married so like everything they own is
like basically I don't know it depends
legally on where they are I guess but at
least in Canada it's like whether you
paid for it or she paid for it it
belongs to both of you
thanks for the gifted subscriptions by
the way thank you but moreover this
dude's acting like he bought the house
with with he he's scrimped and saved but
the only reason he was able to script
and save was because of the fact that
she was paying for everything in the
first place while he was saving the
money
it's like those posts that are like
here's how I paid off my student loans
in one year and it's like uh I never
bought coffee outside uh I made lunch in
my house uh I canceled subscription
services that I didn't need and also my
parents paid for my rent the entire time
and also dropped off groceries two times
a month like it's like then the reason
you did it is because you [ __ ] idiot
you they gave you money
they didn't deliberately say here is
your student loans repaid but what they
did say is we're going to hold you up
well you knock that [ __ ] out for
yourself and then we're going to let
gravity take you back down to earth when
it's easier for you
I told her that she was acting as if I
put my mom's name on the title which is
ridiculous but she said I have no
respect for her opinions and kept
undermining her input
we've been going back and forth on it
since then she's now letting me know
that if I don't take the key back she'll
do it herself
based girl boss
she's now letting me know if I don't
think the key back she'll do it herself
I think she's being irrational and
unreasonable
and acting like that over a copy of the
house key the decision I made could save
us in case of an emergency but she kept
down playing it
ETA
I think it's crucial to mention there's
no conflict between my mother and my
wife they're on near perfect terms all
right I thought I already established
that above
um
well like
I think ETA it seems like edit to add
but I don't know if that's a a made-up
acronym I don't know if I've ever seen
it before
so I think it is a little weird I don't
think she's doing anything necessarily
sneaky I think it is a little weird to
be
this upset that your spouse's parent has
a house key
like I don't what what is she think's
gonna happen they're gonna like steal
her stuff I it does add like a liability
what if what if you're
what if your mother-in-law loses the
house key what if she opens the door and
you know lets your dogs out or something
like that but that's you just say hey
don't lose that hey don't
let my dogs out you know and stuff like
that so I think she's going like a
little
over the top but I do also think it's
like I mean it's her right because it is
I mean you can't be married to someone
and be like this is my house like that's
just not that's not how it works
just just saying it out loud is is
making me laugh
it's not your house like you live there
together
and you're married like it's a it's a
shared asset even if not legally but
usually legally because it's like
you know you're using it together
go find your own house I mean I was
surprised you didn't say like you know
maybe you could go buy your own house
and decide who doesn't doesn't get a key
but it's it's a little
I don't know it's just it's both of this
is just kind of weird to me
um
listen this is rare for me I I do think
it's in everybody's socks here I wanna I
do think that the wife has uh the the
right to say that person doesn't get a
key to the place where I also live
but I do also think is weird
and the husband is definitely a bit of
an [ __ ] in the situation for sure
mostly for not acknowledging that his
wife did contribute to the household by
paying the bills while he was saving
money
like if you're if she's paying your
bills and you're using the money that
you saved on the bills to save money
she's helping you she's paying half into
the savings fund like you you got to
understand that right just because it's
in your name this guy is just obsessed
with titles too he's obsessed with the
deed and the pink slip and the
who's got the routing number and what's
the what's the Bank's address like it's
he's all tied up in the legality and
he's missing obvious stuff that you're
going 50 50.
I mean you could do at your finances
when you're married however you want
it's just like
I don't know like don't let this happen
because this is not this is not real
it's not your house it's it's your house
it's not his house it's his and hers
anyway
I mean I I'm giving it everybody sucks
here he I think he sucks more but I
think that
um
she's I'm not even saying she's doing
anything wrong it just seems a little
crazy you wouldn't be okay with his mom
having a key because I just I just
wanted her to articulate what she's
worried about I guess she could be like
I'm just uneasy with it and that's fine
but you know
suck it up I guess because you know
I think you'll be sick you know to have
my in-laws have a a key wouldn't have to
pay for a cat sitter
come in water my water our plants and
stuff like that pick up our mail this
sounds nice to me
but I think he's worse because he I
don't know why he's so obsessed with the
with the with the deed
you mentioned the deed like you
mentioned the deed like five times yeah
because that's I forgot if I said it or
not it's not like I put my mom's name on
the deed my name's on the title I paid
for the house with the money she allowed
me to save
you're the [ __ ] and this is why you
can't trust no one when it comes to
money you played your wife you probably
told her you would what is this insane
post that is fan fiction
you probably told her you would save for
a shared home and that's why she should
support you and pay your share of the
rent now she didn't contribute a penny
to your house your house she gets no say
but your mom does LOL you're the [ __ ]
Supreme Court just asks user received
the Reddit Gold for this post
50 55 000 of votes
it's still there's a little bit of I'm
not going to say projection but the
little fantasy there
you're the [ __ ] she paid all your
expenses while you saved and she's not
even on the title
info she paid all the rent while you
were saving why isn't her name on the
deed
it's called Financial abuse and it's a
common tactic used by narcissistic
[ __ ] to maintain power in the
relationship
we don't know enough about this to start
uh I'm not saying that this doesn't
exist I'm just saying we don't know if
this is a situation or that where he's
doing this
I don't even know who's on the title to
our house Kate do you know is this
something we should be looking up I
think we're both on the title
we both had to be there and sign a bunch
of papers
that's for sure I remember that
but I don't have like a safe in my house
with uh with a bunch of documents in it
that's like here's the deed
bro actually the law is like kind of
silly
you know what I like
even if like let's say Kate wasn't on
the deed to our house
it seems like a stupid system where I
could be like well your honor we were
married
um and she lived in the house with me
for a decade but it's actually my house
because of this piece of paper right
here
and the judge is like well my hands are
tied the piece of paper does only have
your name on it so it I mean it's the
same
it just seems weird right it's like the
same way when people are like make sure
you read the contract which you should
always do but in the fine print it could
be like you owe me a million dollars
blah blah blah like you wouldn't just go
in the court and be like well your honor
I was signing like an end user license
agreement to download XCOM and uh all of
a sudden it says I owe 2K a million
dollars and they'd be like well did you
[ __ ] sign it
sorry sorry
it looks like you signed it so my hands
are tied
Finders Keepers
we should bring back Common Sense law
you know like the Code of Hammurabi I I
got to think about that one a little
more we'll lead us to
keep we'll freaking lead us to get but
do you ever think that maybe like the
law like needs to be rebuilt from the
ground up
because it's like when you write code
right you're like I'm gonna make an
elegant program and then you're like oh
there's an edge case okay I'll
compromise my ideals slightly to build
in something to handle that edge case
and then it's just Edge case Edge case
Edge case new framework Edge case Edge
case someone got fired we don't know how
to rebuild the method that they did so
we're gonna do it over here in like a
we're gonna just rig it up ourselves and
then you just at some point don't you go
like I gotta just tear this [ __ ] down
and start from the beginning I feel like
that's like the law
we got to bring this [ __ ] back to like
let's start with like law number one
don't kill people and then we'll just re
we'll build it from there but better
anyway I don't know what I'm talking
about I think this is just a crazy post
why is your analogy so accurate I have
an associate's diploma in software
engineering I know a little bit I can
Fizz Buzz with the best of them



oh am I the [ __ ] for asking for a
morning off from my baby on the weekends
I think I can already tell you how this
is gonna go
and I guess that this is something like
um my my wife watches the baby all week
and I work all week so I'm tired on
Saturday and let's see how the
conversation goes from here hey thank
you for the raid
hold on I saw it
Zeus Zeus 007 a Greek god and also a
secret agent is there anything they
can't do
enjoy some react Court we're going to be
here for a bit I think so oh my God it's
only 12 18.
it's been a high resistance stream today
don't don't say God of War don't say God
of War
my wife and I have a six-month-old baby
girl she's mostly a stay-at-home mom at
age six
it's ambitious
I ain't no listen I like to call in the
ambiguity of the English sentence
sometimes
she's mostly a stay-at-home mom she
works two half days a week and her
sister watches the baby I work full time
and go to school one day a week we've
always had an arrangement where she
takes care of the household duties well
I happily support her monetarily how
honestly we are both living our dream
life and my wife does an absolutely
spectacular job taking care of me and
our little one okay
okay
on the weekends we share baby Duty we
usually make sure each of us gets our
own alone time to do whatever we want
however our girl has hit a bit of a
sleep regression waking up every two
hours since my wife breastfeeds she's
always taking care of the baby full-time
overnight she's a light sleeper and
unfortunately has insomnia whereas I am
a deep sleeper and wouldn't wake up for
baby cries anyways okay I see that this
is getting worse
I'm scared about how this is going to go
recently my wife has been asking me to
wake up with the baby both days on the
weekend so she can get an extra hour of
sleep baby wakes up around 7 A.M I get
the baby dressed and take over for that
hour but sometimes I want to be the one
who gets to sleep in an extra hour I
brought this up to her and she says
while she's happy to let me nap during
the day she really needs that hour
because she can't nap like I can okay so
far this is a couple that is having a
disagreement and are handling it
amicably
we got into an argument about it saying
I'm being in very insensitive I know
she's exhausted and can't nap during the
day and she struggles getting back to
sleep every time the baby wakes up but
I'm exhausted too work wears me out and
school days are long sometimes want that
extra hour in the morning I don't want
to spend my time off napping I want to
play video games and chill out
I've gotten mixed opinions on who is in
the wrong here or if there is even
anyone in the wrong am I the [ __ ] for
asking us to share mornings off for
Sleep listen
you you guys were like you were like 45
55
until you said
I don't want to use my time off to sleep
I want to play video games it's not
because video games are not a worthwhile
hobby or Pursuit it's just that your
sleep and your your spouse's sleep take
precedent on it when you have a baby
if you want to stay up and play video
games as the dad and I don't do this
because I respect my body and my psyche
if you want to play video games as the
dad then when you put the baby to sleep
at night
maybe it's eight maybe it's nine
you played the [ __ ] games until 2 A.M
and then you wake up at 6 30 to go to
work in the morning you you sacrifice on
your own end to you you're you rob your
own Peter to pay your own Paul you don't
Rob anybody else's bucket to give
yourself the video game time you you rob
your own bucket wherever you can
if you think you you desperately need
the alone time for whatever it could be
reading a book it could be playing video
games it could be you know whatever
something leisurely
then you know if you guys are both under
control if you're both cool sure take an
hour here or there if you're both like
first six months is like is [ __ ]
[ __ ] it's Juno Beach right like you
gotta you gotta start with the
foundation of Maslow's hierarchy of
needs is everyone eating is everyone
drinking enough Waters everyone getting
sleep then you don't worry about
self-actualization until you know maybe
when she's like a year and a half you
can start to get back to that
so yeah like he is the [ __ ] though
like I mean I don't think he's a bad guy
here's a little secret about having kids
and I only have one right like that's
where I'm still in the tutorial but like
[ __ ] you're tired
she's tired guess what [ __ ]
everyone's tired
get up go to work
look after your kid while you're tired
cook them some do like a grilled cheese
while they're tired you cook uh can't
keep my eyes open any [ __ ] longer
give them the grilled cheese they throw
the [ __ ] grilled cheese across the
room you pick it up you're tired it left
a little grease on the floor go get a
paper towel and
buff it out when you're [ __ ] tired
like you're tired like a lot
so you should be handling you know you
and your spouse need to look
after each other
you're not Allied against the baby but
like you know you're
you have to make sure that like you're
you're like rock climbers one of you is
climbing and one of you is belaying you
know so like when one person's climbing
every once in a while the belayer should
be like hey you good up there you need
me to take some of the resistance for
you
it shouldn't be like like once you once
the person climbs the mountain and
they're like okay your turn you're like
actually I just want to eat a snack down
here sorry your ass was belaying
well I was climbing now your ass has got
to climb while I belay okay
it's a team game
so I don't think he's not like an
[ __ ] like he didn't threaten violence
against anybody but it's just like you
know
everybody's tired that's the he you
think it's I listen I have an easy job
especially physically speaking but like
it's I'm a little tired after work
sometimes looking after the baby is like
10 times more tiring I think most of the
times if you work a physical job it's
it's maybe different but if you work
like a white-collar job
the person doing the stay-at-home duties
whether it's a stay-at-home mom or a
stay-at-home dad is probably more
exhausted than you
because you get to talk to adults all
day and they have to debug like a
machine that only makes one noise uh and
if they make a mistake she could go real
wrong like real quick
so anyway I'm just saying
I'm not trying to make it a contest I'm
just saying like
you you have to make each other a higher
priority than playing the video games
now like you know our kid is too there's
some times where I go to Kate and I'm
like you know usually it would like me
would be like a Friday night or a
Saturday night I'll be like hey just so
you know I would really love to have
just like an hour off
if you could if you could handle her nap
tomorrow so I could just do whatever I
want for an hour that would be great and
she says okay and then like 45 minutes
into okay like the hour starts and I'm
like what am I gonna do with all this
free time and then I do nothing and
after like 35 minutes I'm like I guess
I'll just help out because I don't know
this to completely destroyed my
abilities to have any hobbies I might as
well just you know might as well just
fill up the family bucket a little bit
more and Kate will do the same thing to
me she'll be like you know I have this I
have this uh like a Japanese lesson can
you watch her for two hours and I'm like
absolutely no problem
but at six months you're in the [ __ ]
dude you're you're in
Charlie Company man
you don't get to take a a day off when
you're Behind Enemy Lines you gotta
kind of just gotta suck it up
I know you want to play God this is you
see the damage that God of War is doing
the families across North America right
now
uh on the one hand I have a
six-month-old infant and both me and my
spouse are like tired and stressed out
on the other hand it is a 94 meta score
right now and I don't want to be I don't
want to miss the discourse I don't want
to miss the discourse
you're the [ __ ] if she's taking all
the night Duty because you don't wake up
then you get the morning Duty when you
do wake up so she can catch up on her
lost sleep in the night you want a
morning off give her a night off if it's
it's so simple when you put it that way
you're the [ __ ] you don't think she
wants to just chill out and do something
on her own time she's working too by not
just going to work but also taking care
of the baby the least you could do is
give her some time to sleep in that's
the other thing like I I know I'm in
danger of being two based but like being
a stay-at-home parent is a job
and you get paid for it
the way you get paid is by not having to
pay for daycare
and that [ __ ] sometimes pays very well
like we have daycare four days a week
for a month
and that [ __ ] is like
1400 bucks a month something like that
and we live in a province and a country
where there's like rebates on that so
we're actually like paying below
market rate for daycare
so like if you're paying if if you're a
stay-at-home parent Even in our
situation
that you're making 1400 bucks a month
just by looking after the kid
and that's only for four days
[Laughter]
adding a fifth day I don't even be
looking at like almost two grand a month
and that's after the rebates so I don't
even know if if the government didn't
like subsidize it probably no kids would
be in daycare because the [ __ ] would be
like 3 500 bucks a month
hey vookie thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
don't even get me started on that sixth
day
Oh you mean the Arnold Schwarzenegger
movie
I haven't seen that one yet but I did
only see Total Recall
or I did just see Total Recall
2K is still only like a 35 000 salary
okay but like you don't understand you
got to evaluate versus your
counterfactuals somebody's got to look
after the kid
you're either getting daycare or you got
like a family member which would be
amazing
or you go or you leave the your six
month old at home and you go out to work
for you're like sorry
the opportunity cost of of doing this is
simply too great
I could save 35 Grand on daycare
this job pays me 80 000. what do you
think the odds are they'd be okay if I
just left them in the crib from 8 30 a.m
until 5.
they'd probably be fine right
yeah plus it's tax-free kind of I don't
listen we don't need to get into it
you're the ass okay yes unless you're
gonna offer to take over the feeding
through formula the only time she gets a
break if baby is sleeping or if she's
off to work that's definitely also I
didn't even mention that but like as a
dad
I don't want to say you got it easy in
the first year because like nobody's got
it easy but like the mom has no choice
if she's breastfeeding if the baby's
hungry she's on the damn clock so it's
kind of and it you know I didn't learn
this like day one but it's pretty much
your responsibility to do like
everything else
because there's like a a ton of stuff
that
is being done every day that you
literally can't do so like if you see
something that needs to be done that's
it kind of falls on you to do it
plus like don't give to listen your kid
is six months old
when when our kid was six months old
look there's a lot of work but when she
is like she's not even really like
crawling around that much you just put
her in like the the baby bouncer and
give her like a rattle you can play
rocket League or something like that
like just
just chill out
you wait wait and listen it's easier to
parent like a two-year-old than a six
month old don't get me wrong because I
can actually like ask my child what's
wrong
and like what it doesn't mean that it's
like a what's wrong I'm hungry here's
some food you like thank you Daddy like
it's it becomes more of like uh like a
Clarice versus Hannibal Lecter type
thing sometimes you know I was driving
my daughter home from daycare yesterday
she tried to get [ __ ] Scarlet Witch
into my brain just driving her home
yesterday she says Daddy
you are not a good driver
I was just
safely driving home minding my own
business
and I like just catching a heater for
absolutely no reason whatsoever I don't
know what you wanted me to do be like
there's some time you know what it is is
sometimes because we live in a city
there's traffic and when she wants to go
home and have like a chocolate egg she's
like Daddy drive faster and I'm like
look at the freaking [ __ ] Pride
faster there's cars in front of me
anyway
but if you think it's it's exhausting at
six months wait till she's uh two and I
don't even might even get harder from
then
wait till she's two and she's running
around and she's jumping and then you're
like don't do that you're gonna fall and
then she falls and she's like ah and
you're like I told you and then you're
like
uh here's a Band-Aid and she's like
thank you Daddy and you're like oh so
sweet and then she's like I want another
band-aid and I'm like I already put a
Band-Aid on your boo-boo and she's like
I got another Boo and I'm like okay
where's your other boo-boo and she's
like it's on my knee and I'm like I roll
up her pants and I'm like right here and
I'm like there's no [ __ ] boo-boo
there and she's like I want a Band-Aid
and I'm like okay it was like here's all
the band you're spending like 25 bucks a
month on Band-Aids just a placater
you think it's exhausting at six months
get ready like it doesn't uh
I'm not saying it doesn't get easier but
it should you're not you're not stopping
the hustle anytime soon
wait until uh you know instead of just
taking the baby for a walk while they're
in the stroller
you're you're outside baby duty is
taking them to the park and then being
in this position
squatted on on your on your heels in the
sandbox going
oh yeah
what are you doing
oh really oh you're making like a oh a
sand fish okay wow that's cool wait we
don't think you're doing that for two
hours every Saturday and Sunday
walking up to other parents
I think hey I think you're I think your
little one there has our shovel
can we can we get that back
anyway
but you leaning I'm not I'm not
resenting it I I love it and I volunteer
for it that being said I'm just saying
like welcome to the [ __ ] show brother
you want to play some video games
do you want to start building a list you
can pencil some in maybe 2026
something like that
better they're not closing up the Disney
Vault anytime soon or you could just
become a streamer I guess but anyway you
could just make it your job and then
just scroll Reddit all day
foreign
Marvel you can play like two games of
Marvel snap before she notices you're
neglecting her sure
it's called self-care
anyway just imagine the payoff when 2026
comes around no but then that's the
thing and I've seen this from dads of
older kids
they'll make posts that are like when I
had no free time all I wanted to do was
have free time now my kid is like 12 and
I don't know what to do with myself
that's why you end up with like dads who
are just like I'm just gonna like be on
the couch they don't even have the TV on
they're just sitting there like
you know my dad when he wants to buy
something it doesn't have to be like a
car he wants to buy like a chair he does
like a hundred hours of research
looks at every every morning he goes to
Wayfair Ikea Amazon driving around like
local hardware stores what are the
reviews on this chair what kind of what
kind of wood is this chair made out of
what's the oh but then there's a new
chair sale coming in August I just want
to wait and see what the chairs get like
that's what you got to do when you you
you go through this period where you
have like a a lot of free time as a
teenager and a young adult I had a
staggering amount of free time
you become like a no offense but like a
real adult more and more
responsibilities fall on you you know to
maintain your household and you know go
see family and stuff like when you're
like 20 and they're like oh can you
visit Grandma you're like no [ __ ] her
and then we're like 25 you're like okay
let's visit Grandma like you know I'm
part of the family you reintroduce
yourself into the fold in your free time
gradually the clients and then when you
become you know a parent it goes to like
zero but I'm not sure if you ever I
think it's it's probably a struggle on
the other side when your free time
starts coming back
to figure out how do before you know
when you had so much free time you're
like oh I'm so busy I think as your
responsibilities recede a little bit
you're probably like what the hell do I
do to fill this hole
I guess you volunteer or play golf or
something like that but anyway
sorry I got a little sidetracked there
Marvel snap yeah yeah Marvel snap
I needed nighttime support from my
partner when my child was a newborn he
didn't take it serious and it took more
effort for me to wake him up to help him
than it was to just do it myself I
stopped feeling like a human the
resentment never went away we divorced
when the kid is too
owned honestly
well our kid is not three yet but I'm
we're gonna beat you
[Laughter]
the difference
and we don't know this could be made up
it's all creative writing let me get the
humor in while it lasts okay
I also feel like you gotta know your
spouse
like Kate and I have uh uh not a dilemma
with a balance is actually the word I'm
looking for
Kate needs sleep
that's like the number one thing she
needs and everybody needs it but that's
like her highest tier requirement on
Maslow's hierarchy of needs for me it's
like number two
I mean as long as we're ignoring Like
Oxygen for me number one is food for
sure like if I'm hungry it's just a
countdown till like I say something I
regret which is why I eat all day pretty
much continuously
so we we have a balance in that
where like if the baby wakes up during
the night or if she's having a hard time
getting to sleep usually not always but
usually I am the person who volunteers
and is like oh she woke up crying two
times last night at like two and five
I'll go in I'll put her back to sleep
and then I'll like sleep on the ground
next to her for a little bit no problem
but then the caveat there
is if it's ever like
if I'm ever like it's time for lunch she
doesn't get to say no let's just wait 30
minutes that's
we we were waiting for 30 minutes for
the last 30 minutes you just didn't know
so we got to get that lunch
ASAP in order to keep it's like when
your car says it's running out of gas
you don't go just hold on a bit you say
Siri where's the closest gas station
right and it works that way
or it works for us that way
yeah I've been waiting for lunch since I
since before I had breakfast
right after I eat uh breakfast I'm like
man I started daydreaming about what I'm
gonna have for lunch even if I know I'm
just gonna have a ham sandwich it's the
it's the quantum superposition of lunch
that I maybe I'm not gonna have a ham
sandwich maybe I'm gonna have some pizza
maybe I'm gonna have some poke maybe I'm
gonna have a samosa I don't even know
maybe I'm gonna have some Dosa I don't
know and then I'm like I'll just make a
ham sandwich it's quick
but then I'm like oh for dinner maybe
I'll have some Korean Fried Chicken
maybe I'll have some Pho maybe I'll you
know you get the idea maybe I'll have
some crew today
rip op
you're going to be buried in the you're
the [ __ ] judgments here she works PT
takes care of the baby has to do all the
housework has to do all the night
feedings can't sleep but sure you'd like
an hour
you were out of the house all week and
you do what spend one hour a day helping
to take care of your kid and you would
like more time to play games you have no
idea what her day looks like do you take
three days off and send her on a mini
vacay to sleep somewhere and see all the
stuff that she does on a daily basis on
repeat true yeah yeah true for sure
I mean don't get me right it's
completely understand I can put myself
in the dude's shoes you know like a year
ago
you were playing video games like crazy
because your wife was pregnant and she
probably didn't like the way you smelled
even though you smelled the same way you
always smell it just does something to
the whole factory system in in some
women right so you were like man look at
all this time I look at all this free
time I got to play video games and then
like a year later that [ __ ] goes from
like 10 to zero and you're like I'd
really like to have some Recreation time
so would everybody is the thing you
gotta
you know it's not I don't think he's
doing like a bet it's human it's but
what you do is you go in the group chat
and you go oh I wish I had more time you
don't go to your spouse and be like
sorry honey could you like be better at
napping like
anyway
there's a lot of [ __ ] posts this week
it's kind of a juicy week
am I the [ __ ] for calling my sister
selfish for announcing her pregnancy at
our parents house
my husband and I have been having a long
struggle with infertility we have been
getting treated and trying for a baby
since 2017 but nothing worked my
understand my husband is understandably
devastated as he'd always wanted kids
but never got the chance to be a father
okay that's that's fair that's fair and
hard
but
he's super sensitive around the
infertility topic this my family knows
days ago we got together with family for
dinner all of a sudden my sister and her
husband announced that they were
expecting we were stunned me and my
husband I mean as for the others they
were thrilled as everyone got up to
congratulate them my husband got up
pushed his chair to the side and walked
out they all stared at me but I got up
and told my sister she messed up by
announcing her pregnancy like this from
a zero consideration for my husband
knowing how he feels about this topic
she got defensive saying his issues with
the topic listen
foreign
I know I haven't read the rest of the
post
I'm I'm all I know everybody in chat's
saying you're the [ __ ] if the sister
knew that the husband was really beaten
up over this I'm not saying is is not
within her purview to announce it at a
family dinner but like she could have
been more sensitive about it that's it
it's I'm not saying that it was like a
intentional moment of of weakness but
it's something that people are very
sensitive about justifiably
like I I honestly didn't know I know it
sounds naive
but like the only reason I found out is
because like on r slash Peloton cycle
the subreddit for people that are
obsessed with riding a stationary bike a
lot of instructors had gotten pregnant
and there were people that were making
posts that were like it's actually like
hard for me to do a ride with my
favorite instructor because they just
keep talking about being pregnant and it
brings up these issues that I have had
with this stuff in my life and I'm like
okay I I honestly would just naively
never knew that it was uh
that common or that big of an issue but
obviously it makes sense
that being said
just because something makes you
feel sad
that doesn't mean someone behaving
normally was an [ __ ] about it
all I would say on this one I'm not
maybe maybe it's a nobody sucks here
actually maybe well but then I'm listen
I'm a slurping
yeah oh I mean you put yourself in the
sister's shoes and you're like well I
just announced that we're having like
the happiest day of our life and then
like immediately after I got yelled at
by my family so that does suck
that's that's something that maybe it
would have been nice to put in like the
group chat afterwards but still
you know I I kind of feel like this is
just like a life sucks and you're doing
your best I don't know if we have an
acronym for that this seems like a life
sucks and you're doing your best but
sometimes feelings get hurt
situation
that's my take on it and it's to uh
it's too spicy I don't want to
I don't want to keep it up this dude
needs to do ketamine nasal spray
chib what are you
ketamine I told you once I've told you a
thousand times you can't solve all your
problems with ketamine nasal spray okay
there's some things you need to micro
those psychedelics to get over okay
am I the [ __ ] for expecting my
girlfriend to cancel her plans for me
can I say without being an [ __ ]
myself it depends what the plans are
if her plans were to play video games
and your plan was to look after the baby
then I'm just saying that you reverse
the roles then
I mean I know how this sounds but like
to put it in the most right way possible
if her plans are shitty then no that
doesn't make you the [ __ ]
if her plan was to go grocery shopping
and you got her like a a reservation at
a fancy restaurant then she should
cancel
unless she's a picky eater and then I
don't even know what we're gonna do
we're gonna get lost in the weeds but
my girlfriend is super into hiking we
planned a trip to Cali that involved a
hike in the Grand Canyon she'd always
wanted to do we did a hike the day
before that was too intense for me and
I'm not as fit as her I finished it but
I couldn't go on the other hike AKA her
dream hike it was also not meant to be
done in one day and the Rangers said it
was hard to do in one day and not
advised okay now this [ __ ] happens if
you're gonna go on a big hike on day two
maybe chill out on day one
like you shouldn't follow up like a
eight hour walk with like a 16-hour walk
that's just poor planning on your part
like I get it that it she loves hiking
but maybe like you could
couldn't you have just gone to like uh
you know the the Gaslamp district or
something like that
I don't know where the Grand Canyon is
it's in Arizona right maybe it's Grand
it might cross into California
don't say this b word needs a different
hobby it's her it's her Hobby
it's
I don't really say why it bothers you
Etc 13 thanks for the gifted
subscriptions as well thank you thank
you
anyway she said she was confident she
could do it saying she had hiked harder
and she's very fit but I just felt like
she was discounting what the Rangers
said I said I wasn't going and she would
go alone and I asked her to wait till
tomorrow for me to recover she said the
weather reported a 30 chance of rain for
tomorrow and she wasn't going to give up
on a bucket list hike if I still wanted
to do it tomorrow she would do it again
with me holy cow your girlfriend is like
an Olympian man
she's gonna do a hike that nearly killed
you a harder hike the next day and if
you still want to go on day three she'll
go again
she might be like the best hiker in the
world also I I know I've had this take
before I'm not saying that hiking is bad
I am just saying I don't get it
like is it isn't it literally just
walking
or is it like like 90 walking 10
mountain climbing
it's walking
uphill oh so like walking up Oak Street
in Vancouver
and then at the top you take a very
pretty photo I'm not knocking the the
pretty photo
is walking on hard mode
could you do it in veggies
if you fell when you were hiking would
you die would you fall down the mountain
or would you just like get a bump on
your knee
sometimes Bro [ __ ] hiking
life's hard enough man depends on the
trail there's damn Trails out there
where if you fall you die
that [ __ ] is crazy man 127 Hours I
thought that dude was like free solo or
something I didn't know he was just
bugging up the Grouse Grind
it could happen to anybody
I also I honestly thought hikes were
like two to three hours long
I didn't know it was like uh
like it's how can you have a hike that
you can't do in one day
you camp what the hell isn't this [ __ ]
heavy I think I'm slowly reverse
engineering why camping is hard
yeah it's heavy you got to carry a lot
of stuff well if you went on a shorter
hike you wouldn't have to carry so much
so you could go further right but then
you would need more stuff but then it
would be harder to carry so you'd have
to
okay all right I think I'm starting to
get it there must be like a happy medium
somewhere
I mean it sounds fun
I do like walking I walk a lot I'm you
know on the weekends I get like you know
maybe 13 000 to 20 000 steps
some of them are uphill
but then I come back and some of them
are I guess with hiking some of them are
downhill as well it's not like unless
it's a one-way trip anyway I don't know
I'm kind of losing it laughs
I did a five-day hike this summer what
do you mean
five days
you walked for five days
I didn't know this existed
I I with God as my that's backpack the
backpacking is when you have like five
pairs of underwear and a shirt in your
backpack and you travel through Europe
through the Schengen States
there's a different kind of back but
this is crazy man I didn't grow up in BC
so like
that's why I lose it every time I go to
Mech and they're like you know hey we
got a sale on Ice axes today and I'm
like no thanks I'm not like uh
I don't have a death wish
yeah I'm gonna go climb a glacier are
you crazy
you're being exhausting I'm not I'm just
simply begging the question
but like you walked for five days like
you slept woke up walked slept
I think I I could get into hiking I
think I could get into waking up early
taking a a hike that is like a two-hour
Summit
and an hour and 15 minutes down
and then having like a two pint lunch
getting back into the city in time for
for lunch
and I think those two pints would be
hidden man
holy cow
I don't think I could do this sleep and
then wake up and walk again though
I mean I couldn't do it right now but
maybe with some I just don't I'm not
that interested I guess anyway sorry
anyway
um yeah where were we I got mad because
I felt like she was okay with abandoning
me with nothing to do at her campsite
and I didn't want to oh well this is
another element I thought they were in
like an Airbnb and then they were going
out hiking every day now I realized
they're living in the damn Woods I can
listen I think the guy is being a little
selfish
but at the same time I'm also like man I
can't hike tomorrow my girlfriend's just
gonna leave me in the woods staring at a
tree for like 16 hours
like that's pretty I don't know if
you've got like a phone charger or
something or even if they got a signal
or something out there that is crazy man
enjoy the outdoors we can't walk what
can he do in the outdoors if he's not
walking
roll
anyway she finished it the next day and
I didn't I felt like she didn't care
that I was too tired to hike and chose
to go without me to me the people are
more important than the activities but
the Hershey definitely wanted to finish
the hike at all costs well it sounded
like you
took your girlfriend on a hiking trip
and then kind of like
just OD'd on it I'm gonna be honest this
seems like something you need to train
if she's this in the hiking you gotta
like be there for her
or like
you guys I'm not saying you should break
up because you don't hike but like if
this is a huge part of her life this is
I mean it seems like she's really into
it I mean she did three crazy hikes in
three days
you didn't take it seriously enough
if her username is like I love hiking
then you you gotta either join her
halfway there or you gotta you know let
her find like her own free solo type
dude that they can hike together
skill diff okay no not ketamine nasal
spray
take a hike or take a hike absolutely
true
yeah I don't think you can complain that
she went without you but at the same
time I am kind of putting myself in the
dude's shoes and I'm like man I'm just
sitting in the damn tent for 16 hours a
day I know it's just different strokes
for different folks because I saw
someone say like oh I don't know uh read
a book meditate that just sounds like
annoying
I can do a shavasana for like a minute
but around like 50 seconds in I start
thinking about all this [ __ ] I gotta do
that day I'm not meditating for 16 hours
who am I like the the am I Buddha
himself
what about meditations by Marcus
Aurelius I mean that [ __ ] is like 45
minutes long it's like 30 pages
I'd just be eating s'mores all day
I don't know that just sounds boring I
don't think I think that
I mean I don't think she's in the wrong
at all imagine your boyfriend is like
hey I got you this cool hiking trip it's
on your bucket list and then on like day
two he's like can you cry just not do
that like that doesn't make any damn
sense
I don't think it's like in everybody's I
think the guy I guess he's an [ __ ]
he's an [ __ ] because his feelings are
heard that his girlfriend's in better
shape
you went on a trip it's just weird right
you went on a trip to do this hike and
then you were like
oh she did the hike I don't get it
you went on a trip to go on the specific
height and only the day before realized
you're not fit enough to go on said hike
and you really expected her to abandon
her dream now that it was right there in
front of her
you're the [ __ ] yeah but like a soft
soft you're the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] for the way you
worded everything you didn't seem at all
to be bothered about the danger of her
going alone well me neither what's he
have you read the post he doesn't have
the means to protect her she's got to
protect him
his ass is wovilly unprepared to be on
the The Voyage and she's like raring to
go
this is toxic masculinity she's going to
have to cover his ass
also it sounds like you're just upset
she didn't give in when you were
immature and refused to talk to her yes
yeah sure maybe I don't know
you're incredibly selfish listen I don't
know if I go that far but like you know
I don't know it's just weird to me
so by the way her plans was we're not
going to the grocery store
her planes were going on a once in a
lifetime
16 hour long hike so I think that he is
the [ __ ] for expecting his girlfriend
to cancel their plans and it was on her
bucket list
oh here we go am I the [ __ ] for
starting an argument because my
boyfriend boarded a plane before me what
how dare you board planes before me baby
I'm sorry baby I didn't know it was your
turn
this chip I'll give you this one this
might be a this one one might be one for
ketamine by the way I've never done
ketamine I don't even know it's it's a
tranquilizer
that's that's all I know about it
is that the one where you take it and
like uh like it feels like you live a
lifetime but actually in real time like
only a minute has gone by
no all right that's salvia
that's a Black Mirror episode my
boyfriend and I traveled by plane to go
to my parents house for Thanksgiving we
checked in together and had different
boarding groups he was group one since
he is active duty military I was group
three for being a platinum hold Carter
on the airline if we our budget is 1.2
million dollars and we're looking to buy
a house
this is significant since both groups
are considered priority boarding okay
have you followed have you followed this
so far
we are both under the impression that
boarding groups do not necessarily
matter we're seasoned Travelers very
efficient when boarding planes very
normal I assure you and the only thing
that does matter is that we're on the
plane before the main it doesn't matter
who's better than if if I'm better than
her if he's better than me the only
thing that matters is that we're better
than everybody else okay
which are the people who do not travel
often and are generally slower when
boarding planes just say it [ __ ]
you don't like to pay the checked bag
fee so you get a priority boarding pass
with your platinum [ __ ] card and then
you fill up all the overhead bins with
your bags that should have been checked
in the first place and then all the
plebs flying coach are walking into an
empty cabin and yet all the overhead
storage bins are completely full and
you're like there's one person sitting
here why are there seven suitcases in
the overhead bin and then they're like
sir don't worry I can take that and
check that for you and I'm like yeah no
problem it's just got my laptop my
camera and my phone in it go ahead then
the bottom of the plane going
[ __ ] is like just pure silicone Vapor by
the time I open the bag
anyway
when the plane started boarding they
obviously called group one first the
group for active duty military and
unaccompanied minors my boyfriend gets
up and Boards without me I was annoyed
since groups one and two were both super
small and group three my group usually
gets called super fast if not combined
with group two you want to marry an
airport
why is this [ __ ] so specific
it's just so fixated on the damn details
of the boarding groups
don't eat listen I'm I'm Pro boarding
groups the only problem
is like when your ass is in like group
five and then they call group one and
everybody in group five starts lining up
as if like they're gonna get to us any
minute nah man that [ __ ] is like 40
minutes away then they people like they
go to the bathroom they come out they
see nobody in line and they're like oh
you give them my boarding pass uh you
can just see the conversation the gate
agent is like sir you're in group five
we haven't called you yet
what group did you just call
group two oh okay sorry yeah thanks for
delaying 200 people for 90 seconds
because of your negligence
it's not a big deal it's not a big deal
if everybody did it we'd be six hours
late but it's not a big deal
I have some responsibility
this is why Society is so [ __ ] up
anyway sorry
after my group gets called literally
less than five minutes later and I get
on the plane I told him he could have
waited for my group to get called we
could have boarded together he told me
it wasn't a big deal and I said it was
since we were traveling together he'd
never done that before why would he do
it randomly now when he didn't have a
reason besides it's for me why wouldn't
I use that group even though my group is
still considered priority boarding we
got into a mild argument about it on the
plane nothing huge since we were well on
a plane he thinks I'm being an [ __ ]
for starting an argument about and being
upset about him boarding before me but I
think it's Justified since he'd never
done it before and he didn't say
anything prior this isn't a new thing
where he just joined the military he's
been A.D for eight years he's
necessarily he's playing League of
Legends
he's on the U.S army League of Legends
team you're this is he who asked to the
extreme
is the way she's describing it is she's
like it's literally five minutes so I
don't understand why he didn't wait well
he's literally five minutes I don't
understand why your ass cares if it's
not a long time to wait then why doesn't
your ass just wait
why are you so mad
you said it yourself isn't the whole
point is that you just get on before
other people
you just you still got on before the the
other 250 people and Coach what's the
what's the why are you just why are you
making your life hard for no reason
anyway I think I've seen him use his
military ID for a discount one time in
the entire time I've known him maybe his
ass just needed a five minute break
honestly and I feel like maybe after
reading this post there's some
justification for that
anyway uh I accept that I'm being a huge
[ __ ] I should have picked my battles
and not started an argument over
something so petty and small I will be
giving him a big apology this morning
okay well that you know
character development
I don't even want to read this one like
obviously the posts like yeah
you say you're a seasoned traveler why
are you so bothered he left your side
for a few minutes what's he gonna do
steal a Coke from The Galley before you
get on a plane
it's true what what can you do
this post will probably make me
unpopular this is the Reddit classic
I'll probably get downvotes for this 32
000 of votes
okay that yes I don't know I'm not a
doctor but maybe maybe ketamine
what is this post I can't even read this
am I the [ __ ] for crash



in air quotes my ex's mother's funeral
and telling his children I'm carrying
their sibling
it's got to be fake right
it's a little messy my ex's mother and I
were very close I knew her from long
before I started seeing her son I saw
her as my own mother okay already weird
you're presenting this as if this is
normal but it is this is very weird
it's immediately immediately strange we
kept close contact up until the end when
I found out she passed I was devastated
her funeral was yesterday I went without
receiving an invite I didn't know you
needed an invite to a funeral but I
guess this is important for later
if you didn't get it from the title I'm
pregnant with my ex's child unfortunate
situation since he's back with his wife
and things are tense
but that's the current situation I was
going there just for the funeral and to
pay respect to an amazing woman who was
treated me like her own child I even sat
at the back so as to avoid getting
attention however attention came in his
ex my ex's wife came over to me saying I
was not invited and crashing the funeral
so I must leave dude they should have
made a funeral Crashers movie
they even have the ark from Wedding
Crashers with Will Ferrell's character
her boyfriend died in a hang gliding
accident oh I'm flying I'm fine I'm dead
what an idiot
oh they do crash a funeral in wedding
you're okay never I'm sorry sorry
my the meatloaf
uh anyway
classic luckily my ex's older brother
intervened and said I was welcome the
only problem is that after this he
forced me to sit further in the front
literally put his arm around me and led
me to the front despite me saying I was
fine to sit in the row reserved for
family directly behind my ex his wife
and their kids while people were looking
at the body open caskets
their kids is such an unnecessary detail
her head wasn't crushed in it she was
sick okay
she wasn't run over by like a
steamroller or or stabbed a lot okay A
lot of people are saying her head got
crushed by a steamroller
she just had she she died of a broken
heart actually
oh man well people were looking at the
body open casket their kids saw me they
came to hug me and notice my stomach was
big so I asked if I was pregnant their
mother butted in and make made a snarky
comment like yes Darlings she just can't
stop making them mind you I only have
one other child so this comment was
purely to make me sound like a loose
woman
me when I see someone pregnant when they
already have one kid ooh
yikes
um but still I bit my tongue the
youngest then asked if the child will
have my red hair and her this is all
going down at the funeral is so you
gotta have some sense of uh
decorum you don't just have like casual
conversations
there's a service and like people speak
I don't understand
some person that never met the deceased
tells stories about their lives as if
they were best friends even though they
don't know [ __ ] about them
their mother overheard this and
immediately called the kids back to her
I let wait oh say sorry
the youngest then asked if the kid will
have my red hair and the mother just
scoffed and under her breath said
something like God forbid
so I was like maybe but your dad has
brown hair so the baby could look just
like you guys since the baby would be
their younger sister or brother Jesus
oh man
the most convoluted way to get to the
the punch line but it's so good I left
as soon as the funeral was over I got a
call later that night for my ex saying
what the hell
telling their kids about the baby
without talking to them first that you
told me he told me to stay away from his
family am I the [ __ ] edit there was
no affair they separated we dated they
decided to get back together we broke up
it's that's it's what's so hard about
that it's a simple four-step process
they they separated we dated they
decided to get back together we broke up
in the meantime we chose to have a kid
together maybe there was an accident or
something I don't know
they both already knew about the
pregnancy before the funeral
we were on a break
this I'm not giving this point this
poster time of day okay I'm
it's not real and if it is real it
shouldn't be real your life is [ __ ] up
you need to be an adult
it doesn't matter who's an [ __ ] in
this you've willfully got involved in
this mess
you need to grow up and take some
responsibility and not let this [ __ ]
happen in your life ever again
this is crazy
this is this is like a
Days of Our Lives plot
you just chill out
it doesn't what I don't know if they can
do that in the law
your honor of crime was committed and
that judge is just like yeah but like
listen
you both can't to be held responsible
for your actions I'm rendering the
verdict of innocent by criminal insanity
not you're not criminally responsible
due to reasons of insanity
nobody's in the wrong in this situation
because it was made up to begin with
am I the [ __ ] for not buying a
lemonade for my pregnant wife I love
this one man oh here we go it was gonna
be nice and fun to make fun of and then
all of a sudden it says she has diabetes
so that was a more complicated situation
that I can't just mock
that's not fair to me
am I the [ __ ] for reorganizing my
library while pregnant and telling my
in-laws my husband wouldn't help me
is that even mean
it's a little who asked right out of the
gate but like
why is my camera up here by the way when
did I move my camera back here it's
supposed to be down here
I've recently had an almost obsessive
urge to reorganize everything in my home
okay it's a good start
my library is one of the places I felt
needed to be changed ASAP so I asked my
husband multiple times if he would help
me as my shelves are pretty high up and
I have lots of books that are heavy to
move hey uh hubby I want to do something
can you do it for me
I'm just saying
if you if you get the urge you should do
the surge too
can we just buy like a ladder or
something oh she is pregnant that's true
okay well like listen
okay she probably shouldn't be up on the
ladder forgot about that part but at the
same time
if you got the urge to reorganize your
library
sorry Toby Maguire are you from
Spider-Man one but I missed the part
where that's my problem I guess it's my
problem because you know in this case he
he put the baby in her but like still
he's probably got stuff to do
you don't have to act on the Urge yeah
I'm going a little too far but maybe
let's see
um he kept telling me he would help me
later as he was busy
sorry honey I've got real stuff to do
I can't placate your urge right now
it felt like later was never coming so
finally I decided to just do it myself
while my husband was working my in-laws
came to visit us they walked in on me
grabbing books from the higher shelves
they thought what I was doing was
dangerous and I could have fallen my
husband also freaked out and kept
telling me to get down saying I
shouldn't be carrying heavy things
my father-in-law asked me why I hadn't
asked somebody else to move my books for
me and I told him I did ask my husband
but he wouldn't help me he did try to
correct them saying he would help me
later but my parents told him off for
not doing it for me bro he's working
this is a [ __ ] false dilemma I'm
feeling for the guy bigly here
just because your husband wouldn't help
you reorganize the library as quickly
and urgently as you wanted doesn't mean
you have no choice but to do something
dangerous as a pregnant person
the there is a third alternative which
is don't do that
it's not like she had no choice but to
put things at risk
she was just I mean I hate to say she
was just bored
just bored in a little bit a little
prayed crazy okay it happens
now you made him look bad in front of
his parents you made him look like a
like a bad spouse they're speculating
he's going to be a bad father too
because he wouldn't immediately placate
his wife's insane urge
he thinks I made him look bad to his
parents and is upset I didn't correct
them because I didn't wait for him to
help reorganize the library we kept
arguing because I told him that he
didn't help and that I didn't want his
help anymore and I would finish the
library for myself lady you got to
recognize listen
you know that scene and knocked up where
Seth Rogen
tells Catherine Heigl [ __ ] you hormones
you're being a real [ __ ] right now
hormones that's
I've never been pregnant
would say is that
if you have a craving
for food it can't be sated your husband
should go out and get you a pickle and
peanut butter sandwich or whatever if
you have an urge for
reorganize the library
can't you just watch Netflix like I did
I just don't understand
like you got to acknowledge that you
have some crazy thoughts
like what if she said like oh I want to
like uh work on the engine of the car
honey can you work on the engine for me
and then he's like I got something to do
she's like well I guess I got no choice
but to do it myself like
just don't understand why you gotta
like she didn't have to do it it's not
an urge let's be honest it's a want I
know about nesting okay
you can Nest you can you can clean you
can reorganize why you got to reorganize
your damn library none of y'all are
gonna be reading any books anytime soon
So What to Expect When You're Expecting
and then like a 10-year dry spell where
you read nothing at all because you got
no [ __ ] time you don't need to
reorganize your damn library you need to
shutter it
you need to repurpose it
I don't want to be the person in the
comments that's telling a pregnant woman
that they're an [ __ ] though
you're the [ __ ] from your comments it
sounds like you admit your husband was
in fact busy but feel like you should
have reprioritized to help you with the
library but it wasn't actually urgent it
was only urgent to you if you were tired
of waiting wanted to do it yourself
that's fine but going around and telling
his parents he refused to help you as an
[ __ ] move
are you suggesting over the course of
two weeks you couldn't have found an
hour or two here or there to help
unlikely yeah but like [ __ ]
I'm
like could he have found it's not
important thing I I was struggling with
the best way to say it civilly but like
it's [ __ ] that important
you got other important [ __ ] to do she's
nesting okay so what
Giga Chad so what
but if she's like she's like oh I'm
nesting can you put like the baby proof
locks on all the cabinets and stuff yeah
your ass has got to get on that
if she's nesting and she's like can you
just do some busy work for me so I feel
sated that she's I'm not saying it's not
on the to-do list but it's dropping down
to the damn bottom we got a lot of other
[ __ ] to do just to keep the damn trains
running on time
cleaning is busy work this [ __ ] is it
isn't cleaning it's reorganizing the
library
oh the uh the books were in alphabetical
order which it was really easy to find
them but I would prefer to put them in
uh thematic order
like the Spotify recommendation engine
couldn't you just organize all the
shelves but the top like I don't
understand
also like I hate to say it but
you know this is like your last gasp of
freedom is like the the second trimester
it's like the first trimester is like
exciting and then you know depending on
the person morning sickness just I'm
feeling unpleasant for a while and then
the second trimester is like she's
glowing you know everybody's like happy
you're buying baby stuff getting
everything like ready to go and then the
third trimester is like get this [ __ ]
out of me right now get it out so like
why are you feeling that that last
golden period
and then and then the baby comes out and
it's like you know you're in the [ __ ]
again you're in the gulag but like you
got that golden period why are you
feeling that with busy work man
reorganizing the library
I get that it's irrational but still
like
you gotta cut him some damn Slack
she's like hey can you change the baby's
diaper and he's like go give me a minute
and then never comes back then sure but
like
you know reorganizing the damn library
like I'm just gonna who asked and who
[ __ ] cares
[Laughter]
she asked yeah but like why why ask you
know what I mean
she was timeline matters he said he'd do
it after two weeks I would stop
believing the help was coming yeah
because it's not it's it's a useless
task it's busy work it's the word search
in fourth grade when you finish your
math sheet early
she was totally fine doing the work
herself it was everyone else who was
freaking out yeah cause your ass could
have fallen dude he's pregnant
bro bro I was just lifting an atlas
Stone every I didn't have a problem with
lifting the atlas Stone why is everyone
looking at me like I'm crazy
I'm nesting
anyway he looked bad because he made
himself look bad I want to get I want to
get a camera on your ass 48 Hours see
all this shameful [ __ ] that you do see
how many how much time do you waste
every day you draw a [ __ ]
I know your answers are writing this
post from the damn toilet right now
she received 17 awards for this post
your name is Supreme Court just asked
you got a damn you got custom Flair on
Reddit
your husband should really do more for
you shut the [ __ ] up
you don't know anything
you should always do something that
someone asked you to do even if it's
[ __ ] stupid no what is that should
have done the first time it said no I'm
not going to do that because that seems
like a waste of time instead he tried to
be a nice guy and say yeah I'll help you
with it but I'm a little busy right now
hoping that like in three days she would
be moving on to the next insane thing
and he would never have to do it because
she would just be like why did I ever
want to do that in the first place it
looks beautiful as is I think it's a
waste of time you just you know you kind
of Kick Kick the Can down the road until
their desire disappears and then you
when they're like hey can you help me
get the groceries out of the car you're
like absolutely right now because that
[ __ ] is actually like important and
helpful
anyway
I don't think she's the [ __ ] by the
way like I don't
I mean I think she should not have
gotten on the ladder and done it herself
but like I don't think that makes her
like a bad person
just kind of [ __ ] up that she did say
she'd ratted him out to his parents
though that's
a kind of a [ __ ] no-go I mean she
knew she was taking a shot at him
whatever listen I don't care
I was gonna go with not the [ __ ]
until you told his parents he wouldn't
help you not that you wanted it done now
and he wouldn't help right away you're
not the [ __ ] for wanting it done he's
not the [ __ ] for not doing it right
away two weeks for a non-urgent task
doesn't sound that long to me yeah it
did I don't know Josh I'm glad we're on
the same page here
I don't know if if
I'm lazy I really don't think it's the
case or if other people are naive
selfishly I think that's definitely
what's happening here I've had
non-urgent tasks on my to-do list for
like months because I'm like oh I'll get
to that this weekend and then something
[ __ ] urgent comes up
and I'm like oh well I can't just delay
this I gotta handle this right now so
you just keep pushing the stuff that
doesn't matter until later and later
I would love some spam holy cow thank
you
I must be doing something right
can I open the can I'll get to it I'm
busy right now
[Laughter]
uh whoa did they have they been making
these easier that was like that came off
like Saran Wrap
you're supposed to use a can opener for
that yeah we'll check it out one can
opener right here one can opener right
here
yeah
anyway
uh what was I saying
flex your head listen I don't wanna I
don't want to brag and I don't know if
you can see it with the lighting here
I've done the Peloton so much that I
think I've had circulatory adaptation I
now have a permanently visible vein
right here on my temple
that's how thick skin we're getting
right now
and I all when I get really mad I get
one like right here
but I also have like one vein I don't
know I guess it's pumping blood that
like my left eyeball because that's my
good one
the right one is [ __ ] decrepit like
uh uh
uh uh anyway
this one I'm like ah
I can read
it's my aorta
you had that in the ring fit screenshot
yeah but I had to really work for that
one because I was I mean
don't get me wrong I was lifting heavy
but I was also like 5 10 205.
it's very good lifts don't get me wrong
but like the body fat was higher than it
needed to be I was eating like half a
jar of peanut butter at night
just to stay alive
yeah let's do it let's talk in the DMS
Dan I would play some more zone for sure
I was watching a little war zone this
weekend and just hearing like that
you know what I'm saying
oh why did
it
you know what I mean
kind of got me going a little bit
Okay so
yeah I think we've mined that one for
like all it's worth
I do know yeah yeah yeah
why the [ __ ] for telling my
girlfriend not to swim in the morning
I did feel like the guy from Police
Academy there
see listen this is why they should not
have the Reddit sidebar dude I'm just
trying to insult other people and the
way that they live their lives
and then similar to this post
possible
GCS look for Harley Quinn taken what
even is this
so it's a photoshopped cosplay from the
DC Cinematic Universe
from 2000 from March 2017.

Gotham City
continue
anyway
snoozers yeah yeah yeah snoozers Sirens

anyway
we eat 26 male and 23f rent a place from
her family said place has a swimming
pool we have a 2.5 year old my brother
and his girlfriend are visiting my
girlfriend likes to swim in the morning
from about 6 to 6 30 then from another
then for another 10 to 15 minutes she
swims with her daughter because it's a
good bonding experience as well as good
exercise for both of them we've never
had any complaints from the neighbors my
girlfriend isn't exactly loud but our
daughter can be not every morning and as
much noise as you'd expect from a
toddler okay
my brother brother's girlfriend asked if
we'd stop this for just a while because
they're staying
due to noise in the fact that she's a
light sleeper plus my girlfriend spends
every Sunday in the pool and she and my
brother don't feel comfortable being
around her in her swimming costume
which is British for like a swimming
pool I think
um
but then said but the noise and not
being able to sleep are important she
did ask very nicely I joked at least
she's wearing a swimming costume while
you're here what the hell are you
talking about
but I did ask are you just putting this
in here to be like you're trying to get
plus twos in the middle of your uh the
middle of your dilemma
is that an aside
[Laughter]
you try it out your stand-up routine and
also getting couples therapy
I did ask my girlfriend about it because
I know my brother's girlfriend has
complained for a while about her
sleeping problems but my girlfriend said
it's perfectly reasonable time citing
that she's silent till 6 30 and it's her
house until then so until her and her
house so until the neighbors complain am
I the
psychically damaging every single post
starts with me number my wife number her
family name name number number our
cousin twice removed name number was
staying at our house the down payment 50
of the down payment was paid by her
parents age number uh net worth and then
they start then they're like at the end
of it they're like am I the [ __ ] and
I'm like I don't know the first two
paragraphs turned my brain into [ __ ]
sludge
and then you're then you're writing
there's typos there's grammatical errors
there's misplaced commas you got a
semicolon in there just to you know
prove that you know how to speak the
English language like it's too much man
can you just write write a sensible
element a medium of communication
that's it
just write a sentence that has an idea
I don't understand
but my girlfriend says it's a perfectly
reasonable time citing that she is
silent till 6 30 and her house so until
neighbors complain and her house dot dot
dot so until neighbors complain dot dot
dot editor's note and be the neighbors
complaining would mean that she would
change her behavior
but I just think it's an easy request to
maybe change it from 6 to 6 30 to 6 30
to 7 or something well she's upset with
me and things are tense but I knew I had
I not asked things would be awkward with
family over such a simple thing
listen
get a life I don't know
I feel like if people are visiting your
house I mean this is um I am falling
into the Trap where I'm like if a man
did it
come on oh oh big man can't just delay
his swimming for an hour to let some
people get some sleep but because his
girlfriend's doing it I'm like holy cow
she's girl bossing right now like let
her go dude
but I do sort of feel like if you're
visiting someone's house
and they
like you wake up at 6 30. because you
have a kid well welcome to the [ __ ]
show dummy
the kid the kid's gonna be loud
whether they're in the swimming pool or
in the hallway right outside of your
bedroom so I don't really know what you
want to do about this situation honestly
sorry I've been yelling a lot so I got a
voice crack I'm just seeing if I got
some more water
full bottle
oh that is like
no it's like this like this
me when I get a bottle of water
it's the Yoda that talks like a normal a
normal person instead of a Yoda
I did point to the camera first I don't
know what's wrong with my brain I'm not
good with with shapes anyway I don't
know I kind of feel like they should
just I mean you're staying in their
house if they if you go to a someone's
house and they have a toddler and you're
like hey could you have your toddler
keep it down then yeah you're kind of
the [ __ ] that's not a reasonable
request it's like saying hey while we're
here could you make gravity like a
little less heavy
it's not it's not realistic so like I
don't know
I also don't feel like if
all right let me rephrase I feel I feel
like if they're like well we'll wake up
at 6 30 instead of six they would be
like no that's not enough these
[ __ ] sound like they're
sleeping till like nine like degenerates
Okay so
I think that yeah I think that you're
kind of the [ __ ] for
passing that on to your girlfriend just
a little not like a lot but just a
little bit
I was gonna go with not the [ __ ]
until you let us know the real reason
was due to her swimming costume it's
this whole thing about she's wearing she
has a an obscene swimsuit
if they had just asked her to swim a bit
later as to not wake them then maybe it
would have been nice to accommodate them
since they weren't comfortable around
her in her swimming costume they can go
stay somewhere else if that bothers them
what what's
what is the costume
is it Harley Quinn
from Gotham City sirens
it's Bayonetta it's a clown
why do they care about the swimsuit it's
like going to the beach and saying I
feel comfortable because people wear
swimsuits in the beach oh
bog bog POG Chad check it out
We're Not Gonna Tyler won this
he has a a very famous clip where he
holds up his pasta to the camera and
then it all slides off the plate
oh baby
Josh do you hate spam
I'd love to know
that's good stuff man that is good stuff
that is tasty
sodium
sodium
people would really be like ooh spam
processed meat disgusting then when the
little Naruto fish cake is in their
Ramen they're like um
it's not processed meat uh that's Naruto
you know that [ __ ] is like a hundred
thousand cuttlefish put in a grinder
heard that then it extruded out into
like a paste with like a little food
coloring making the damn spiral on it
listen yes and I'm just saying don't
install spam if you like the Naruto
I don't understand I'm mad at this one
I'm just mad that he's so weird about
his wife wearing his swimsuit why are
they so weird
[Laughter]
I don't get it
I'm weird and I'm normal compared to the
posts on Reddit you've heard the
thoughts that I have that just come out
on the stream it's not normal
and yet I'm like a Bastion of Sanity
compared to the people that are making
these posts
am I the [ __ ] for telling my
girlfriend she should give up on Seafood
because I'm allergic to it
I am allergic to seafood and
unfortunately my girlfriend adores it
ever since we got together about three
years she's made an effort to eat it as
less as possible which I appreciate
however I wish she'd completely stop to
be honest the other day she went out
with her friends at a restaurant when
she got back I tried to kiss her but she
stopped me and told me she just ate
Seafood I got a bit disappointed because
I was looking forward to spending some
time together with her and I told her as
much and then I said that maybe it'd be
better if she just gave up Seafood
altogether
listen
I know there was that story like 15
years ago about a guy eat a peanut
butter sandwich and then kissed his
girlfriend and then she died because she
was allergic to peanuts unless I'm
mistaken
I believe that it turned out that
actually that is not what happened and
her ass like ate the peanut butter
sandwich I think there was like a we got
click baited in real life
I'm not saying you couldn't be so
allergic to something that if someone
ate it and you kissed them hours later
you would suffer something but like it
doesn't seem
likely am I ignorant to say that is
like his ass is like
it's like allergic allergic right in the
in this case right
like that doesn't it it kind of doesn't
make sense to me
like when he goes to his dentist does he
have to make sure that his dentist like
has not cracked open some crab legs that
like just before you get just before you
get into the gum work here could you
tell me if you've ever eaten
a crawfish boil this week like I just
I
because I'll be honest if he's this
allergic
then she should give up the seafood
because it sounds like his ass is in
peril
but I don't think he's that allergic
because it shatters my worldview
can you stop saying his ass slash her
ass sorry are you watching this with
your with your priest I apologize
anyway I know she likes it but sometimes
it can be an inconvenience to me but you
should not listen he has a point he has
a point that is not uh the way you want
to phrase this
you cannot use the word inconvenience
and and assume that it's going to
strengthen your argument
I feel like she should be willing to
give up such a small thing for us Hey
listen I'm not taking aside necessarily
but it really is like a small thing
how often are you eating Seafood
I love Seafood I probably eat seafood at
most like I mean if if we're counting
fish
two times a week
if we're not counting fish
twice a month Maybe
of course you count fish we're weird in
North America some people are like I
love fish oh what do you feel about uh
crab oh I don't need Seafood it's just
you gotta I'm not endorsing it I just I
grew up here and this is the way people
talk about Seafood for whatever reason
or they'll be like I love fish and
you'll be like oh what about uh Herring
they're like nah too fishy
but I love I love salmon I love fish and
chips I love like a filet of fish how do
you feel about um bass it's a little
fishy for me
mackerel
I think they feel like they cooked it
wrong because it smells a little fishy
she got upset by my request said she
loves me but that she's sorry because
she's not giving up on eating it and
that lowering the amount of time she
does was already enough I asked her do
you love me she told me only part me
I only love my squid and my Cheddar Bay
Biscuits hun I'm sorry
her family eats Seafood often she grew
up eating a lot of it so I kind of get
why it would be hard for her to give it
up
but I think if she cared enough she'd be
willing to do it so am I the [ __ ]
I'm sorry to tell you this sir
your ass
your ass is inconvenient to be with
which means it doesn't mean the
relationship is doomed but it means you
have to know your place a little bit
everybody's got their problems Cato she
talks about it on her stream all the
time
she was talking about how like I didn't
notice that my boot had dog poop on it
even though the whole time I was driving
home from the daycare I was like man it
really smells like dog [ __ ] in this car
then when I got home she's like you got
dog poop on your boot and I was like
damn now I get it
like my brain is it's good in some ways
and bad in other ways so I try to make
up for the
penalties by amping up the benefits a
little bit
you got to come to it with a compromise
or something I don't know you got to do
so I just saw Austin it is [ __ ] I can't
uh
it's great
Austin that is [ __ ] well it was rather
nutty
sounds like she's already compromising
yeah like listen don't take this the
wrong way
she chose
she chose the crab over you that night
and that's fine tomorrow night you guys
can have some [ __ ] rotisserie chicken
and go um tonight she said give me the
scallops
I want the scallops more than I then I
want the affection
big whoop go cry about it sorry
I don't think it makes you the [ __ ]
necessarily but I do think you gotta you
know like start living in the real world
bro if it's you versus scallops
I mean you guys are going 12 rounds okay
Some Nights the scallops are gonna get
uh they're gonna get a 9-8 from the
judges sometimes you're gonna get an
eight seven okay
there's got to be some good ones man
am I the [ __ ] for giving my for
asking my son to give me his boss's
number
oh no it's not about discipline
it's in case of an emergency okay I
thought it was like my boss yelled at me
give me his number that that would have
played to my biases for sure
am I the [ __ ] for not checking the
scores of a certain NBA game on a
three-hour flight for a passenger on an
in-flight Wi-Fi I paid for planes are so
funny
the smallest things become huge in the
air
it's unbelievable
hold on it is a Larry David moment
I was on a three-hour flight on an
airplane oh what a relief I thought he
was on a damn dirigible
I didn't have any form of entertainment
on me besides my phone and you had to
purchase Wi-Fi to use internet during
the flight
this I'm not even going to go into it
I'm not even old
you know how many flights I've taken
where I just stared at the seat in front
of me
it's weird because I know we were
talking about like meditating earlier
and I'm like I can meditate for about 45
seconds and that's it I've had a lot of
flights bus rides train rides where I
just like
just be like
and just kind of get lost
read the in-flight magazine through like
two times and then just be like
oh we're here
so like you you tell I don't you don't
have to justify buying the Wi-Fi I'm
just saying that the fact like you were
like I have no choice but to buy the
Wi-Fi is a little crazy your ass could
just like sit there a little bit
it was 8.99 for the whole trip so I
decided to purchase it since I didn't
want to be bored the entire trip there
was a passenger sitting next to me he
asked if I could check the score for a
certain NBA game since I paid for the
Wi-Fi I should be able to use it however
I want so I said no he wouldn't accept
no for an answer and said it would take
less than five seconds I said I don't
care you can buy Wi-Fi yourself if you
want to know so badly would I be the
[ __ ] in this situation yeah like why
are you being so weird
he can also be the [ __ ] but why are
you being so weird I just don't
understand
he shouldn't feel like you have the like
he has the right to compel you to do
something you don't want to do but like
it honestly sounds like you want to
invoice him for like the 17 cents worth
of time it would spend to look it up
like this guy I know not everybody's
brain works like this but this guy
basically said do you want to be friends
and you said why would I ever want that
like that's basically what happened here
he he probably wanted to know the score
of the basketball game because he had
100 bucks riding on it on DraftKings or
whatever that's beside the point he
offered you an olive branch he basically
said it was a rock and unpainted on the
rock it said
basketball fan and you said get Ben
I spent nine dollars hey I'm paying
three dollars an hour
for the Wi-Fi and you think I should get
out of my Ivory Tower and tell you the
score of a basketball game
and then you made a post about it on
Reddit later it's just so weird
it's just strange
everybody sucks here we live in a
society and the animals are leaving and
we live in a society where it is
customary to extend small favors and
courtesies to people if it will take us
less than five seconds to do you should
have just told him the score he's also
an [ __ ] for not taking no for an
answer true
but let's find some crazy posts
I want to live in a world where
strangers can ask simple favors and
others are pleased to grant them well
within your rights to say no but you're
the [ __ ]
okay yeah another another sane head
another another sane person
can you tell me what time it is I bought
my own watch if you want to know what
time it is go buy your own there's
people who think like that unfortunately
I think
I hope it's not too many but
okay you're the [ __ ] and you're mean
you're weird
if the game had happened and you didn't
check the score I'd have said the
[ __ ] was happening you're opening
yourself up to check for it through the
rest of the game for the rest of the
flight or any other game it's one of
those If You Give a Mouse a Cookie
moments and if they're entitled enough
to argue with a stranger about something
they didn't pay for they won't just ask
once and leave it be
now we're talking
is
if you said yes to to one thing you're
gonna have to say yes to everything
forever then you'd be the [ __ ] it's
that classic tale of the bunny stealing
out of the mailbox
sorry I can't resist the spam
the mouse needs ketamine nasal spray
true
I had something similar happen to me on
a six hour flight a lady asked me to
check the weather or something and I
agreed and thought it was all done then
she kept asking me to look things up and
would say you looked it up for me before
it's just one thing and wouldn't leave
me alone for the next five hours listen
I'm not saying this [ __ ] didn't happen
but you need to like be nice but also
like grow a spine
like you need to be like okay there's
the weather and then maybe look up like
one more thing and be like Oh I'm sorry
I have some work to do you're just like
tell a nice lie and then go back to
watching Netflix or something like that
I mean if she's like you're just
watching Netflix I thought you had work
to do you'd be like Oh I'm a casting
agent
and your ass just got blacklisted
and I don't work for the show The
Blacklist so that's bad you're never
gonna work in this town again
plus do this
we're just like kitchens look at it's a
five hour flight can you just look up
[ __ ] for like two minutes and then be
like oh I'm really tired
pretend to be asleep a little bit like
this is
I work at Netflix I'm proof watching the
show so true you ever wonder how they
get such good subtitles
that's me
me repeating the character's dialogue to
myself while I watch the Netflix show
with subtitles off
I I just can't believe some people take
themselves so seriously man
it's just like that I'm the tiredest
I've ever been in my whole life
am I the [ __ ] for telling my husband
to get over himself my husband is a 14
year old daughter get over yourself

to change careers the nine-month UBC
master of management has dedicated
coaches to help you plan your future

the fact that this [ __ ]
is is advertising UBC with a photo of
downtown Vancouver
false advertising UBC campus is
beautiful but that shoot is in kit

I didn't know Vancouver had mountains
like that bro we are we're we're nestled
we're like you know you see the
Todd Howard loves Vancouver because you
see those mountains there you can climb
them you can even see it for yourself
there's a little Dame ski hill just
above the harbor Center this point it's
pointing right to it
that is what downtown Vancouver looks
like I'm not saying this wasn't
photoshopped
but like it if it might have been
touched up but they did not move the
mountains closer let me put it that way
no this is not my view this is this is
the view train wrecks has
I look outside of my window I see the
dumpster that we saw in geoguess or that
one time that says Joan Cusack on it for
whatever reason
that view happens like once every five
years no it happened we it happens all
the time
there are some times when today was very
foggy but even like after it rains you
get that view
and then there's some forest fires you
probably we get a view I would say like
180 times a year like 50 of the time

building
don't threaten me with a good time
what is this squeaks emo man



rumors of reactor's death have been have
been greatly exaggerated
we're back immediately with the top post
of the month that are sorted by who is
the [ __ ] okay
am I the [ __ ] for banishing my
teenage daughter's friend from our house
because she made fun of my weight
I want to say right now it depends is
was her friend 13 or 19. and if you're
saying it doesn't matter I'm here to
tell you it does
let's just read it first okay a 14 year
old daughter i37f have two kids with my
husband 41 male
a 14 year old daughter and a 10 year old
son
our daughter has always been a little
socially awkward to the point where we
had our testers since we suspected her
of being on the Spectrum turns out she
isn't on the Spectrum she's just a
natural introvert
however this year in school we were
thrilled our daughter made a new friend
her age since that is in an area where
that is an area where she struggles
long story short she recently invited
her new friend over with our approval to
have dinner at our house and then spend
the night so my daughter's friend came
over my husband is usually the cook in
the family and this night was no
exception
he's made us all a really nice meal
during the course of said meal I asked
my daughter's friend are you enjoying
the food she responded Yes your husband
is a great cook no wonder you've ended
up a bigger woman holy cow
that is what we in the conversation
business call an unforced error there
was no need for that whatsoever
are you enjoying the food yes I am no
wonder you're fat holy cow
just to being polite
the room got quiet for several moments
my husband tried to laugh it off and
change the subject but I wasn't having
it the girl just leveled a completely
uncalled for insult at me my daughter's
friends seemed to realize that she'd
messed up but she didn't say anything
else we finished an awkward dinner in
mostly silence and my daughter's friend
did stay the night this was a couple of
months ago recently my daughter asked if
she could have her friend back over and
I told her sure if she's going to
apologize to me when our daughter asked
what I meant I reminded her of what
she'd said my daughter responded that it
was over and she didn't want to bring it
up again she then went to her father and
asked he said sure but she didn't tell
him what I said
although I'm just scrolling down a
little bit he came to me and said
daughter's friend just felt awkward and
tried to make a joke it didn't land for
the sake of our daughter can't you just
let it go yes I could but the thing is I
just want an apology from the girl I
need to see that she understands how
rude she was before I can get on board
with her and my daughter hanging out my
husband says that I am being weird for
insisting on an apology from a 14 year
old especially since that girl is a good
friend of our daughter I think it's
weird
that I'm still waiting for an apology
from the same girl seriously that's all
I need I just need to know that any
friend of our daughter is willing to own
her own screw-ups you're the
um you're the [ __ ] and I
I see where your daughter if she's
socially awkward gets it from because
you're uh like three times the age of
her friend and you're having a long
simmering Feud with a like what like a
ninth grader who does that that's listen
first off
I'm not I I guess it's not my position
to tell her that she shouldn't be
offended but in my opinion she shouldn't
be offended long term I think if our
daughter if this happened to me
I would find it funny
now again I'm my reaction doesn't have
to be everybody's reaction Kate is
probably she's going to vouch for me in
my opinion
Kate honestly if if we had even if we
had uh like
if our nieces were like
hey great cooking no wonder you're fat I
would go like holy cow and I would think
that it was probably one of like the
funniest things I'd ever heard just to
have the stones to to even bring that to
the table is is worthy of respect in
some ways
I would I would probably plus two them
I'd be like wait what did I do to get
myself owned by like a a 14 year old
I mean but this is even like that's at
the moment of
when the actual event took place if
you're ever people act irrationally when
they get offended myself included like
you get upset you start thinking with
your uh your hippocampus instead of your
prefrontal cortex the
an hour later you cool down and you go
you know what I got to be honest that
was pretty funny a month later you
should be over it and then like two
months later you should be making inside
jokes with the person who insulted you
in the first place you guys should be
bonding over it
so yeah I mean I think obviously
I don't want to get like too deep into
this but like I think the dad the father
in this case is making a lot of
he's making a lot of sense like it's
been months can't you just get over it I
mean she's not your friend anyway she's
just she's your daughter's friend
listen if your daughter's a little weird
her friend's probably a little weird too
why won't she apologize because she's
[ __ ] 14. she's just like a 14 year
old weirdo like
everybody's weirder than 14 to begin
with and then add a little extra
weirdness on top a little awkwardness
sure
it'd be so embarrassing
exactly that's I can understand listen
I'm not saying the 14 year old was in
the right I'm just saying like that's
listen you [ __ ] got the benefit of
being a child you probably made a mess
all the damn time didn't clean it up as
much as you should have now as an adult
you gotta give this you gotta pass it on
you gotta you gotta pay it backwards
I guess it is still paying it forwards
you were treated with kid gloves when
you were a kid and now for the rest of
your life you have to treat kids with
kid gloves just the way the society
works you know
Society gets great when
men plant trees they'll never sit in the
shade of okay
just be nice anyway
I mean I think she's just a little I
understand her being offended and if her
friend was like if they were in their
20s that would be like maybe a different
story but like at the same time if she's
14 and she's your daughter's only friend
you gotta just eat that one up also like
what's when did we forget how to laugh
as a society
okay they're they're both awkward yes
that but your name is queef Latina what
the hell
you're the [ __ ] you should have asked
for an apology at the table what she
said was very rude I think she knew as
soon as it came out of her mouth but she
didn't know what to do to make it right
if you said that's very rude I'd like an
apology she would have been like I'm
sorry right there and well awkward it
would have been over you missed your
teaching moment holding a grudge for
months against the 14 year old is silly
and you're punishing your daughter
unfairly yes very true
you're the [ __ ] stop it I just spray
them with those with a spray bottle yeah
also
well I don't know like here's the thing
people are like
don't parent somebody else's kid but
like sometimes
you got to do that [ __ ] I parented a
couple kids at the park
they'll be at the you know they'll just
be blocking the slide and their their
mom or their dad is on their cell phone
like you know 10 feet away refusing to
look up you just got to be like hey hey
buddy you ever consider um going down
the slide
I don't want to well we all got to do a
lot of things we don't want to do and
there's a lineup of kids behind you that
want to go down the slide mean while
you're just like begging the parents to
please like take a make an effort
anyway
today junior
dude it's my favorite genre of am I the
[ __ ] post am I the [ __ ] for not
attending my husband's celebration
dinner due to the restaurant not having
anything I could eat yeah man like what
are you talking about it's your
husband's celebration dinner
you're gonna just attend and don't eat
it's not about you I'm not saying you
have to eat something you don't like but
just eat a granola bar before go to the
Celebration and then go through the
McDonald's drive-through afterwards
my husband has been working really hard
the last two years to advance at his
company and he finally got the promotion
he's been after I'm really really proud
of him his parents are too and wanted to
take us all out to dinner to celebrate
my husband absolutely loves prime rib
and there's only one place in our area
that serves it so he picked that
restaurant thing is I'm not fond of
steak I'll eat it but very rarely I
prefer chicken or fish I looked up the
so you're not even like a vegan
you just prefer chicken I was ready to
almost meet you like a third of the way
but you just like you prefer other meats
to the meat that he prefers
I prefer chicken or fish I looked up the
menu before leaving and right now they
have a limited menu the place only had
one fish Andre and two chicken entrees
oh man oh none of them sounded good for
various reasons that I really should
have gone into because I feel like the
story would have been even better I
suggested he picked someplace else so
everyone can eat he refused sighting
that we rarely get to go to this place
but go to other places in our area
regularly which is true but those places
have lots of variety so everyone could
eat she said the damn Cheesecake Factory
I see you
he suggested I ask if they could prepare
the fish or chicken without the
marinades or sauces but I didn't want to
be difficult for the kitchen staff his
next suggestion was that I ordered
dessert while everyone else ate the
entrees and then when we were done he
would take me where I wanted so I could
eat dinner while he and the kids ate
dessert so I opted just not to go
because I didn't want to sit there not
eating and not having a good time while
everyone else was my husband asked me to
go so he could celebrate with the people
most important to him I told him no
again and that he needed to get going
before he was late he did go but he came
back a little over an hour later with
the kids and they all had to go boxes he
said he couldn't think of what to tell
the kids about why I didn't go and when
they kept asking without lying or making
me sound bad so he just got it to go
order for them and let the kids spend
some time with their grandparents
talking in the parking lot I told him he
should have stayed but he said that I
put him in a bad spot with the yeah you
threw him a suicide pass
That's a classic suicide it's also
called a poison pill
I'm gonna make you swallow this thing
that is going to basically you're saying
I'm Gonna Make You make me mad
no have fun no you go have a good time
there's no way to there's no way to win
I maintain if he really wanted us all to
eat dinner as a family he should have
picked a restaurant with a more
accommodating menu
am I the [ __ ] update some of these
comments were pretty harsh but a kick in
the pants I've apologized profusely to
my husband I'm going to take him to a
restaurant this weekend and buy him some
camping gear he's been eyeing as a start
to making it up to him and changing
course yeah she's like um a little
unreasonable
I mean this is this is next level it's
not even picky eating it's just like uh
it's just entitled like
we are going to go my husband earned a
promotion he picked the restaurant
it the restaurant's known for prime rib
I normally prefer chicken or fish but
they only had three chicken or fish
entrees
and none of them sounded like exactly
the thing that I want to eat like is
this the first time you've ever been at
a restaurant where you you have like
limited options
like I I understand if you if you're
used to going to a restaurant where
there's like a burger section on the
menu that is just like beef and corn
syrup like 12 different ways the Jack
Daniels Applewood smoked bacon burger
the the cheddar and Swiss burger the
mushroom burger the plant Burger the
farm burger the garden Burger the like
the tequila lime pineapple Burger the
burger with the onion rings on the top
the inexplicably tall burger with the
messy fried egg on top of the top bun
the burger that comes with another
Burger as a garnish on top of it like
it's just too much
because you're like the way she's making
herself sound reasonable by saying like
I prefer chicken or fish which is
already like not that reasonable when
preferred just means you are willing to
eat steak but it's not your favorite
thing in the world but that's okay
because it's in honor of someone else
um like why does I just don't understand
why she's not eating the chicken or the
fish they don't sound good
you don't go to a restaurant to decide
to hear the food
I know we've been through this before
I'm kind of like a
I'm a very like restaurant nihilist
I've probably eaten at a restaurant like
1500 times in my life and I've had like
three bad meals
like one bad meal every five years the
rest of the time they don't restaurants
are not in the business for the most
part of like putting bad food on the
menu
because like then people will eat it and
never come back like most of the [ __ ] on
the menu at a restaurant tastes good so
like if
if if you like chicken and fish and the
chicken and fish don't sound good my
personal suggestion is maybe just give
it a try you might learn something
anyway
I gotta I mean obviously she's the
[ __ ] people are saying go to the
comments she elaborates more let's let's
see
let's see what she's saying here
how many comments
not many comments she's she only made a
couple which is great
okay are you really trying here we go
let me I don't even know if my screen
region will look right here
kind of are you really trying to say
this restaurant only had what four
dishes that they served maybe we should
click on the context
holy cow this first post is too insane
I'm not reading the essay here
this has 93 000 upvotes holy cow
the various reasons was one of the
dishes was chicken fried chicken and I
don't eat fried foods the fish was
Snapper
which I don't like and was stated as
being marinated in bourbon sauce prior
to its cooking and the chicken was
glazed with a bourbon sauce I can't
stand even the slightest hint Suburban
or its smell listen I I think that is
ridiculous but it's like less ridiculous
than it sounded in my head
if she is disgusted by the smell or
taste of bourbon then okay
fair enough if everything has bourbon in
it then I I understand but I
I don't like Snapper though is is also
kind of like I don't know like
this is not going to be a popular take
I have a pretty easy life I'm not gonna
say that I don't do you ever feel that
some people's lives are just like so
easy that they have forgotten how to
deal with like the slightest bit of
adversity
like you can just eat
you don't like Snapper okay then order
the steak
or order this snapper
and like eat a little bit
put the rest in a to-go box take it home
your husband will eat it out of the
fridge at 11 45.
it's okay you'll you'll be fine
it's it's just not that big of a deal
like you can I I know I referenced this
once a month this is our our classic
Kitchen Nightmares Jay Willy's reference
this is giving me huge Vibes of the
woman at Jay Willy's who starts to cry
because they serve her Burger on
sourdough bread instead of a hamburger
bun
and then they have to like Comfort this
middle-aged woman who is mad she's
literally weeping because her hamburger
sandwich is on the wrong kind of bread
he even offered to take her to a
different restaurant she was like yeah
no you should pick no no it's your it's
your special day you pick could you pick
someplace else though
anyway
the various re okay sorry are you really
trying to say this restaurant only had
like what four dishes that they serve
even if they did you could have you
couldn't have eaten beforehand and
gotten something small like a salad no
they had a variety of steaks and beef
ribs and pork chops I don't need ribs or
anything made from Pig because it upsets
my stomach and makes me gassy steaks are
50 50 if I get gassy half the sides had
bacon in them so they were out okay what
about the other half
one salad had peppered steak in it the
other salad they were temporarily out of
because they didn't have the mandarins
grapes or Cranberries for it why didn't
you just ask for the salad without the
peppered steak no reply
[Laughter]
man
she's not ready
she's she's not ready for what the world
might have to go through you know
you gotta you gotta train yourself to
have a little bit of strife in your life
so when a very normal situation comes up
like this like my favorite food isn't on
the menu
that you just
you just eat it it's okay like
anyway
especially listen you should really just
do this
on the regular I'm not saying like every
week or anything like that but like at
least a couple of times a year you
should find yourself in a situation
where maybe you gotta try a new food
okay
but like especially when it's your
husband's promotion like
like you just gotta own it you know it's
my wife's birthday sometimes you know
she's like I want to go to this place
and I'm like it's not my favorite
restaurant okay
it's not my it's not my 25th birthday
for the fourth year in a row
you you just go and you you have a great
time and you know what maybe you try
something new and you find out that you
actually enjoy it
it's like literally the simplest thing
in the world
yeah I remember I ate the damn triangles
[Laughter]
I ate the konyaku
hey you know what I I took more than one
that [ __ ] I didn't know what it was on
the menu
I said just give me whatever
I took one it came out it looked like
[ __ ] goo and I said I'll try it and I
said this is the worst [ __ ] I've ever
eaten in my entire life and then Kate
said you gotta try it with the mustard
so then I I dipped it in the mustard and
I was like this is still ass
it just the mustard is kind of good but
the triangles are horrendous and I'm
still here to this day
I didn't immediately go throw up in the
alley outside I just said I'm not trying
that again
and that's something I don't even like
she likes the food it's just not her
choice
it's just
like this is like juvenile Behavior like
if you're
did you send them back no I think they
were supposed to taste like that is
I don't think that I think we made a
mistake in the ordering process we
should not have been in that restaurant
probably
what was the dish called it's called
konyaku it's also known as the devil's
tongue jelly
I know what a team player go hey no uh
hey nice have a nice dinner honey
how about you and the how about you and
our whole family have a nice dinner
without me don't have too much fun
this is called a suicide pass
am I the [ __ ] for calling my wife
ridiculous for saying she won't attend
my family's Christmas over some
stockings
I love this subreddit am I the devil
my mom has a tradition for every
Christmas and that is to get custom
stockings of her grandchildren's names
and hang those stockings near the
fireplace very wholesome
my wife and I have been together for
three years she has a son my stepkid
from her former marriage when she found
out about the tradition my mom has she
said she expects my stepson to get his
own custom stocking and be hanged along
with the other kids stockings I asked my
mom and she said she loves her stepchild
but she does not feel comfortable yet to
have a stocking of his name and gang it
in her home
um yeah you're the [ __ ]
it's a it's just a sock it's not that
big of a deal
if she's already going to the embroidery
shop to get the stockings done you can't
just add like a plus one to the order
she's basically saying this is not a
real grandchild
which is like
her right to say even though is really
rude but like she couldn't just
let him feel included for Christmas
[ __ ] morning is one morning
apparently my wife refused to drop it
and chose it as a hill to die on
apparently my wife for whatever reason
like loves her son or [ __ ] whatever
and said if you make my son feel
uncomfortable I'm not going to come to
Christmas
what is she's thinking
even told me she would not be attending
our Christmas party if my mom doesn't do
it I'm always I know we've been through
this before and this is not fair I'm
always weirded out by grown men who type
mom instead of my mom
she's not my mom so why are you calling
her mom
this is the way that siblings talk about
their mom to each other not the way that
a stranger thought you need the the you
need the extra word there
otherwise it's like a proper noun
we started arguing about it for days I
finally blew up and told her it was not
reasonable for me or her to dictate how
my mom decorates her home and what it is
not reasonable for you to ask me to ask
my mom to respect my nine-year-old
stepchild
Go violin what am I supposed to do stand
up to my mom a little bit
she started crying and called me blind
for not seeing how my family are
treating my stepson I said they love him
just not enough to get a custom
embroidered Christmas stocking he look
my my mom loves our stepson she just
doesn't consider him like a legitimate
part of the family okay
over time Gene editing therapy might
progress to the point where we can
replace the 50 of his father's DNA with
my DNA and then he would be like a real
grandchild and then he would get the
stalking but for now he I'm he's simply
he's a muggle and he's not allowed to
have a special sock like the other
Wizards
I said they love him and some stalking
isn't going to prove anything she said
she wouldn't go then and I called her
ridiculous for deciding not to go over
something so trivial we have been in
Conflict about it since and she's
refusing to even speak to me am I the
[ __ ] we're saying is ridiculous for
her to not to decide not to go over some
stockings my stepson's age is nine by
the way
okay
um
yeah obviously
like you're in case anybody out there is
wondering why is obvious is because the
guy is not treating his stepson
like with the same respect that he's
treating like listen the the mom can do
like the grandma can do whatever she
wants she's not making the post so like
the guy is asking is he the [ __ ] yeah
because you're basically allowing your
mom to treat your stepchild like they're
not a legitimate part of the family full
stop
and then you're being weird about it and
saying it's just a sock well it's not a
sock it was just a sock why doesn't she
hang up the damn sock
obviously the sock carries more meaning
than that it's symbolic you know it's
the holiday season it's it's not just a
sock
so you can't choose to use that at some
times and then in other times be like oh
I'm not worried about it
anyway you're the [ __ ] three years
isn't enough your mom's a real piece of
work
you mean mom
you're the [ __ ] yeah I mean this is
obvious
hold on let me there's no edits on this
one I'm becoming the Reddit psycho I've
I've given my verdict here and now I'm
going to see if they've left any other
comments
no they have not commented on anything
take this L then case closed
that was an easy one
am I the [ __ ] for calling my
girlfriend selfish for not picking up my
kids from school hmm
well
something listen I like to give my
predictions before we do it let me guess
you had to watch the World Cup
quarterfinals
if you had a heart attack and you were
in the hospital then yeah she's a little
selfish maybe if you just wanted to
watch the soccer game
it was coming home oh yeah I forgot we
had one of these in Euro as well
so am I the my boyfriend male 51
abandoned me 90 minutes away from home
uh female 19. am I the [ __ ] for
telling him that I should be more
important than soccer
I'm male 36 have been with my girlfriend
f-32 for two years I have two boys male
13 and male 9 from my previous
relationship their mom is not in the
picture I work full time and my
girlfriend used to stay home and take
care of everything else yet she would
complain about the kids causing constant
messes not receiving proper discipline
accidents like breaking a Vaz the list
goes on and on your children are Tom and
Jerry they are a cartoon cat in a
cartoon mouse
that are causing a ruckus
between the hours of 8 30 and 4 pm
oh are you are you did I say Vaz
I I got to be honest with you I've never
decided whether I'm a Vaz or a vase guy
I say the word probably one time every
two years
so I I've never had to make a stand
honestly
let me let me read it and just feel what
comes naturally to me okay accidents
like breaking of yavas I'm a Voz guy I'm
a Vaz
she found a sorry she complained that
she's more of a parent than I am which
is not true since I provided income yet
she decided she wanted to go back to
work and started looking okay this is
listen I know how this sounds because we
just talked about the last one
this is a different story because she is
being more of a parent in the sense that
she's actually doing like almost all of
the parenting I get that you need the
money as well but also
they're like not her kids they're her
they're part of her family
you've been dating for two years but I
can see how some resentment would build
up when you would be like hey I've been
dating this guy for two years he has two
you know roughly teenage boys and I'm
doing all the damn work I can see how
that could that could cause some
resentment for sure
she found a potential job in her
interview was yesterday I called her to
remind her to pick up the kids from
school since she's responsible for it
but she said she's about to start her
interview and told me to go get them I
was stunned I told her I couldn't
because I was at work she said I could
take a break but I refused because this
would have affected my job I asked if
she would take 10 minutes to quickly go
pick them up but she refused we ended up
getting into an argument and me telling
her she should have figured something
out beforehand she blew up saying I'm
the parent and she was tired of being at
my back and call all the time
is it back end call
or is it beckon call
hey pretty lady won't you give me a sign
I'd do anything to me call
it's Becca what the hell is Beck
Beck and college I thought it was beck
and call because the beckon and to call
are like the same thing
a Beck is kind of like a call
wait so beckon the root word is Beck
he's a loser baby so why don't you kill
me
anyway
listen it's that's some old school stuff
okay I don't use words invented in the
15th century
the kids ended up being picked up by my
friend 40 minutes later which made them
upset at home I got into a huge argument
with my girlfriend calling her selfish
for doing this to the kids and ditching
them like that she said she had an
important interview and that I as the
parent could have figured something out
instead of expecting her to drop what
she was doing and pick the kids up she
called me an [ __ ] and went to stay
with her mom okay I so I want to add one
thing in here
she should have arranged
some if if if it's been agreed upon in
the past that is her responsibility to
pick up the kids from school if she has
a job interview that's gonna overlap
picking up the kids from school she it
is her responsibility to to sort that
out I'm not saying that means she has to
skip the interview I'm just saying that
the responsibility now has to she has
the responsibility to move the
responsibility to someone else
that sounds right to me
but then why would he call her to
reminder I don't know what's going on in
their relationship okay
I don't know
it sounds like it's all messed up to
begin with so I don't I don't fully
maybe he just maybe because he doesn't
trust her
I don't know I I can't speculate you
know I'm not a normal redditor I'm not
gonna fill in like my own my own head
can in there I'm just saying if it was
like Hey Monday to Friday you're picking
up the kids from school and then he was
like hey uh hope you're having a great
lunch just don't forget to pick the kids
up and she was like I'm at Staples right
now you gotta get him then I would also
be annoyed maybe that's not what
happened though but it sounds like
um
you don't I'm it it sounds like you
don't I mean this is a little too maybe
white nighty but it sounds like you
don't appreciate your girlfriend doing
the I mean she's raising your two sons
well listen
why is she complaining about the kids
causing constant messes
accidents like breaking a vase aren't
they at school like eight to four eight
to two thirty
so like what's she doing what's the
what's the dog doing you know what I
mean
your school starts at eight I think my
high school started at 8 15 and that was
merciful I've heard of like American
high schools that started like quarter
after seven A.M
and if you can't afford your lunch that
day they put you in federal prison
here they just let you starve but at
least you're free
my school started at eight
it's crazy I mean that's listen
part of me wants to say
nobody is such a morning person that
they're doing their best learning at 7am
couldn't you have Run High School like
ten to three ten to four or something
like that but then part of me is like
nah [ __ ] them kids
let's be honest a huge chunk of uh the
value of public education is that it
gets the kids out of the house so the
parents can both be part of the
workforce so yeah all right sorry kids
wake up at 5 45 so you can catch the
damn school bus be be in a homeroom at
quarter after 7 A.M five days a week
anyway
I forgot what I was talking about oh
yeah I don't know I mean I feel like
he's just uh well I listen I don't know
I don't know this one's like cut and dry
but it's not it's not as high uh it's
not as as obvious as like uh the the
picky eater one like that one was just
crazy the dude it sounds like an [ __ ]
it sounds like he doesn't appreciate all
the parental work that his girlfriend is
doing for him which is crazy because
he's only been dating this girl for two
years he has uh two kids so obviously
like he's an [ __ ] for not
appreciating that
that being said like maybe this is this
is like I'm coming to Israel is an
honest question
isn't it
fear to parent like how hard could it be
to parent a 13 year old and a
nine-year-old
I the way that and I only have one child
and they've never been 9 or 13. here's
the way I look I look at it as like uh
intelligence versus wisdom you know when
you're like 20 your brain is [ __ ]
zooming man
it can make like you know a billion
calculations a second but you're stupid
you don't have life experience you you
can't you you have like a goal but you
struggle to prioritize organizing your
life in such a way to reach that goal
unless it's like right in front of you
you're like oh I do I want to have a
six-pack but at the same time like
there's uh you know potato chips in the
pantry okay I understand
when you're older you're [ __ ] stupid
like your brain is slower like it it
genuinely takes me longer to do like
basic arithmetic and sometimes like I
used to when I was younger if someone
was like what's 17 of 90 I would be like
oh I know what okay I'm gonna multiply
90 by 10 and I'm gonna multiply 90 by
seven I'm gonna add them up and then I'm
going to just move the decimal points
over in my head to divide it by uh 100
or whatever now like you asked me that
my brain goes I'm not gonna [ __ ] do
that someone else will do it faster I'll
just wait for them to say the answer and
say that sounds right that's pretty much
like what I would do like it it just
happens more often now that I like I get
I get asked the question and then my
brain goes it's not worth it someone
else will do this for me but I'm like
wise in the sense that I'm like I'm not
gonna do stupid [ __ ] you know I'm not
gonna text and drive because like I
don't I don't even want to look at my
phone to begin with much less like in in
a high opportunity or when there's a
high chance for like disaster happening
so this is the Continuum that I've also
used to model parenting like I feel like
parenting a teenager
is easier in the sense that you put in
less effort on a daily basis but there's
very important wisdom that you need to
impart like you don't need to watch your
13 year old 24 7. your 13 year old is
not going to eat a magnet you know
they're not going to [ __ ] their pants
four times a day and require diaper
changes but at some point they're going
to be like you know Dad me and my
girlfriend are thinking about making the
next step what's your advice and then
you got to give them the talk about like
you know prophylactics and safety and
stuff like that like that I don't have
to do that at age two but I've gotta
occasionally slap something out of my
toddler's hand that they're trying to
eat that would literally kill them so
like I guess what I'm trying to say is
like
you know day to day
how hard could it be to parent a 13 year
old and a nine-year-old I'm sure you got
like some [ __ ] up days
but like
listen I'm just saying you don't have it
as hard as I do so what are you
complaining about
like when I was 13 I'm just trying to
think of like so I was in like the ninth
grade so like my mom would wake me up
and then I would take a shower and I
would brush my teeth and I would pour a
bowl of cereal I'd eat the bowl of
cereal I get on the school bus I'm not
saying she didn't do anything but like I
would go to school I would come home on
the school bus I would open the door I
would play some video games my mom would
come home like an hour later I would say
hi Mom you know we'd talk for 10 minutes
what's for dinner blah blah blah and
then you know I would go back and my
room and play video games this probably
like you know I should have been making
more of an effort to be there for my
family but I was like [ __ ] that you know
NFL quarterback Club 2002 just came out
but like what is a well I know you're
the concern trolling Apollo you're
saying surely that's how every teenager
acts but like you know
aren't badly behaved 13 year olds just
out of the house all the time you still
is like you know
it's not like you got a nanny can on
them 24 7. you gotta watch like uh I'm
just asking like what is your day-to-day
parenting look like
they're breaking stuff in the post
breaking I I don't respect the concern
of breaking a vase okay
because I think that's like how often
could that have happened
how many vases have these kids broken
over the course of this two-year
relationship
one a month that would be like three a
week
do they work do they live in a vase
store I just don't understand
anyway I don't know where I'm going with
this one
here's what I would say I was I would
give this and everybody's sucks here and
you might say like why does she suck
well because like
when you got kids you gotta like make
them the number one priority so like
because because of both of their actions
the kids didn't get picked up from
school for 40 minutes
and like emotionally upset them so yeah
I think that's I think that's in
everybody's sucks here
does she have kids well like
listen first off she's been dating the
guy for two years and even if it's not
quote unquote her kids like she has a
responsibility for the kids
if she could at least tell the kids like
hey just so you know I got a job
interview I'm gonna be late today like
that would be okay assuming the school
would let them stay there but we're
getting too much into like head Cannon
but like to just have them sit there and
then have a friend pick them up at the
end is a little bit anyway
I'm just saying you would like even if
they're not your kids
like if if one I mean we're constructing
like very convenient analogies right now
but like if someone at the daycare was
like Hey I can't pick up you know Jenny
tomorrow can you walk her to my
apartment after daycare like on your way
to your car if I said yeah and then I
[ __ ] didn't do it I can't be like
she's not my kid anyway dumbass you know
you you know it's like you you took on
the responsibility to have to Shepherd
that child's safety you know it's a
little bit of a different story because
the kids at by Kids Daycare are like two
and one year old but like still
there is kids he should have made the
arrangements it sounds like he made the
arrangements and then she kind of like
rug pulled him at the last second which
allowed her to get a lot of Leverage in
the conversation so I'm going to give
her like some serious props for that
like she she she dropped uh like a a
very high ranking card in Euchre at
exactly the opportune moment to put some
pressure on her opponent
I still think you know you gotta if in
terms of strategy well I would say it's
a good tactic for her but not a good
strategy
unless she wants to break up with this
guy in which case you know it's got an
extra step towards escalation so
I'm not listen I don't do who sucks more
necessarily I do think he sounds
insufferable
all I'm trying to say is they're 13 and
nine what are you complaining about how
hard could it be
talk to me when you [ __ ] when you do
change 2000 diapers a year
I don't know everybody's I'm listen I
guess what I'm saying is I think he
sucks in a long-term way
she
sucks in a short-term way
I think she made one bad action that put
her own interests above the children's
that doesn't make her a bad person I
think it does mean she sucks in this
situation
he seems like his his principles and
priorities are all [ __ ] up
which also makes him an [ __ ] and
probably a bigger longer-term [ __ ]
than her
that sounds right
that sounds right to me at least
did you forget they were also babies so
he's been through it twice well he's not
even going through it right now maybe
the mother who was not in the picture
was doing all the damn diaper changes
and then she was like you're not doing
any parenting and he was like Hit the
Road Jack I'm I'm providing the kids
with income
head Cannon head yeah but it's headcanon
that people agree with so it feels more
valid which is very Insidious
similar to this post r slash My Little
Pony okay sure why not am I the [ __ ]
for asking my daughter to uphold her end
of the deal
one thing I need to know about redditors
they love contracts
like if you didn't read the fine print
on a contract and the fine print said
like at the uh if I say
um Balthazar you have to give me all
your money they'd be like well that's
why you read a contract you have to read
it all the way through even if there's
some insane [ __ ] in it sorry Deal's a
deal you made your little identifying
signature with a felt tip pen
now I own your soul
so I have to feel like this one we'll
see anyway sorry sorry I'm getting my
screen region up it's not this one is
this one
honestly I don't feel that this
situation needs to be on Reddit
but my daughter husband and many of my
family members are calling me an [ __ ]
and I'm not really sure anymore listen
how could one sentence be you've got
you've got the wisdom of a sage
and yet the foolishness of a young child
if the people in your life are calling
you an [ __ ] the people that you love
the most and value the most are calling
you an [ __ ]
you should probably listen to them
listen I didn't want to post this on
Reddit but the three people whose
opinions I trust the most disagree with
me and obviously that's not okay so I
need some other people to validate me
here
anyway for context four years ago when
my daughter was 12 she desperately
wanted a pool she said that all her
friends have pools and I'm the only one
who doesn't have a pool plus I love
swimming and I'll use it every day in
the summer my husband and I could afford
one but I'm sure as some of you know
pools are very expensive and neither of
us really like swimming so we wanted my
daughter to understand the cost she was
asking am I in the [ __ ] for buying my
12 year old daughter a 40 000 gift and
not getting the respect I deserved after
it
I told her if we're gonna buy you uh uh
if we're gonna change the property value
of our house and take on a lot of
recurring costs for you as a sixth
grader you've got to understand the
terms of this Arrangement okay
we made an agreement that we would
install a pool but once she was old
enough to start working she would pay us
back for half of it one of the worst
business deals I've ever heard in my
entire life
you you signed a handshake deal with a
12 year old girl
that said Hey in four years you owe us
half the price of this pool
are you crazy you were operating under
and and you didn't do it just to like
feel because I could see not me
necessarily but I could see someone
being like I don't want to spend this
money so I'm gonna live under the
delusion that she's gonna pay me back
for half in four years
and then in four years being like that
was [ __ ] stupid of me I'm just gonna
eat that endless never think about it
ever again
because it makes me feel bad so but to
actually think that it would stick
around like that would actually happen
is is true Madness
well Flash Forward to now she's 16 she's
lived an extra one third of her life and
she's got some different opinions than
she used to have which is crazy
she got her first job and now she wants
to save up for a prom dress she really
likes uh-uh sister I reminded her of our
agreement about the pool what she forgot
about because that [ __ ] was like a
different it was a lifetime ago for her
she no longer wants to uphold her into
the agreement I insisted threatening to
take away her phone and car privileges
if she doesn't take payback her father
and I now she won't speak to me my
husband's agreeing with her saying we
can't have honestly expected a 12 year
old to keep her into the agreement for
me this isn't even about the money in
many ways it's about teaching my young
daughter the right morals to live life
with I don't want her to think she can
just go around making deals for her
benefit and then just not upholding them
am I the [ __ ] you're insane
it's not about the principle at all it
was about principles people would be
like hey uh Mrs principled don't make a
business deal with a 12 year old there's
a reason that [ __ ] is like not legal
they don't know what they would sign
over their life savings for like two
Oreos
they don't have the intellectual
function and and prowess to take an
adult and sober mindset into this they
don't have long-term planning skills
is crazy
obviously you're the [ __ ]
like my daughter spamming I agree to all
the terms of service yeah every time she
opens like a pink Fong Baby Shark app
they're like hey read this whole form my
two-year-old's like boom she doesn't
even just can't even read a single word
what are they gonna do they're going to
take her to court
she's gonna be like Google gaga well she
can actually talk but like she's not
gonna respond to the proceedings too
well
anyway
it's just this is just crazy yes she's
insane
not my daughter she seems well I don't
know how would I know she's only two she
acts a little crazy but I think it's
like you know
pretty pretty part of the course for
someone her age
she's so emotional though dude oh my God
can we just sit down and like talk about
how you can't have two chocolate eggs
for dinner why does everything have to
be a temper tantrum
embarrassing you're acting like a child
it's just it's it's actually you can
justify any stupidity
by just saying it's about the principle
and it it has no validity in this case
you don't have any promises I make to my
two-year-old you promise you're gonna
eat your dinner yeah okay then we can
play a little bit more
catcher like 15 minutes later toss in
the the plate of grilled cheese across
the damn room like this is you can't
reason
I get that she's 12. but like you can't
reason with children
their brains just don't work the same
way that most adult brains work
and then she was four years ago you
shouldn't like I think you can make a
deal with like a 12 year old
that's like I'll get you a puppy but you
have to walk it
and then like the next morning they
should be walking the dog
you can't you can't even do this [ __ ]
with most adults most adults are not
sign in deals where you ever heard of
those like uh uh you know you buy like a
an ottoman at The Brick and they're like
if you buy it today you don't make
payments until 2025
they go back on the payments like 20 of
the time they're defaulting like crazy
you can't sign something that's like
as as a 30 year old it's difficult to
sign something and then be like
yeah four years from now this is where
my life's Gonna Be At This is where my
head is going to be at I'll figure it
out to expect like a 12 year old to do
it makes you the idiot
anyway
hold on I didn't even read the comments
obviously she's the [ __ ]
our slash dogs are slash My Little Pony
our slash movie pass club from 2017.
you got in a verbal agreement with a 12
year old for thousands of dollars and
are now trying to enforce it seriously
four years later the right morals to
live with her that 12 year olds cannot
legally enter contracts thank you guys
I'm new to Reddit and not on other
socials user received Reddit comment for
this post
is is true in Santa I'm glad that people
were were on the same side here
okay hold on op's got some comments
oh no dude
only four comments here's this one was
downvoted five thousand times I'm paying
for her food clothes the house she lives
in the car and everything else I don't
think she needs a cut of the real estate
too like I said this is about morals not
money Logistics hey you conceived her
[ __ ] are you stupid
oh the baby I made is living in my house
dog
who could have predicted that one
it's gonna be one of the stupidest
things I've ever read in my entire life
actually I pay for my 16 year old's
groceries no kidding
she's made of you grew her inside of
your damn belly
of course you're your favorite groceries
he did his story if she was like you
know in her 40s or something like that
but
like my sister in Christ like you had
the baby
you can't use it people some
[ __ ] will really like have a
kid and then use it against the kid
yeah well I made you
just crazy
am I the [ __ ] for telling my friend
he wasn't obliged to hang around my wife
wasn't obliged
my 29 male wife 30f and my best friend
cyan
do not see eye to eye
listen I'm not
suggesting that they are friends with a
crayon my name is Ryan it's crazy I
don't want to act like you just change
one letter and then all of a sudden
everybody loses their minds
some backstory my wife and I moved from
my new job cyan was the cousin of a high
school friend
I don't know why in my head that's
Sam was the cousin
of a high school friend this Bulls on
Parade
it's just it has a very Rage Against the
Machine
Cadence to it
we're talking about the cousin
of a of an old high school friend
downtown
cyan is a very kind person I think my
wife hated everything about them she
thought he was too Goofy and hated how
he teased her my wife takes things
seriously and she's a romantic so things
like date nights are a big deal to her
she hated when cyan hung out even when I
invited him did you invite him on the
date night why did you bring up the date
night and then
talk about bringing him to the like I
just don't understand why you would
write that part in there unless it was
relevant to the second half of the
sentence but
a few months ago I had a four-month
project across the world I needed the
promotion my wife ended up needing
surgery and she unlike me didn't make
any close friends here her friends and
family were too far she couldn't do
normal things post-surgery and wanted me
to come back I complained to cyan and he
suggested that he pop on over it to help
her he ended up doing a lot more and my
wife heavily relied on his kindness when
I came back it was like my wife flipped
her switch things that were immature
became playful she constantly fell for
his for his fish for compliments and it
was like cyan because this is not real
saying could do no wrong cyan still hung
out but it was like he couldn't snap out
of caretaker mode the two of them are
practically joined at the hip when I
went to work my wife packed cyan at
lunch too and his is a lot better than
hers or mine cyan needs this or that or
whatever she showers him with attention
my wife can be overbearing like that at
a small party I came with my wife and
she immediately zoomed to cyan and
monopolized all his time after he went
to the bathroom which was basically the
only time she left him alone I pulled
him aside and told him I knew my wife
was clingy and is okay if he kept his
boundaries he wasn't obliged to hang out
hang around with my wife I said it
kindly he turned red told me I was an
[ __ ] and stormed away he left without
saying goodbye to anybody but my wife am
I the [ __ ] I told some mutual friends
and most of them are on my side they
said cyan didn't know how to stand up
for himself and he was embarrassed is
the world's is fake or is the world's
stupidest man I'm not even suggesting
there's anything going on with his wife
and his made-up person okay
but they could just like be friends
for one you don't you don't have to
assume that he's just pretending to be
friends for just to be nice it seems
like at the at a minimum they're friends
they enjoy each other's company who
cares
and maybe maybe they're having a little
Me and Mrs Jones thing going on as well
did I mean they may they might they
might not who knows people can be
friends
I mean obviously he's that you don't
even need to go in the comments for this
pseudo-erotic fan fiction
am I the [ __ ] for asking my neighbors
to be
more considerate similar to this post
let's give it a second it's still
loading
am I the devil for calling my wife
neglectful
it is weird that
his wife packs Diana lunch yeah
um
I don't know it's kind of weird for in
the modern day it's kind of weird for
a wife to pack her husband a lunch to
begin with
can't you just go to Panera
the whole thing was weird starting with
the names
that story was not real I I would err on
the side of that as well
my neighbors are a young couple



in their 30s Annie and Bill this story
is fake there is no 30 year old man
named Bill
left in the United States of America
if they said
a young couple in their 30s Annie and
will I would buy it will seems
contemporaneous but there is no man in
his 30s going yeah my name is Bill
maybe it is a hundred and thirties
we are running look at the graph in like
1970 we had bills coming out of our
whatever man
now we did we had jobs cash
and Hope
20 years later no jobs no hope no cash
and no bills
I work with a lot of bills
do you would could you pay my telephone
bills anyway my neighbors are a young
couple from the 30s Annie and Bill they
had a baby a couple months ago the baby
is called Cornelius the baby was named
Methuselah
the baby came home last month after
three months in the hospital my wife is
friendly with Annie we can't have
children so whenever we have a neighbor
with a baby my wife makes friends with
them
a little weird like I get it but a
little weird
that's like oh they just had a baby
let's befriend them definitely strange
we have my mom staying with us as she's
no longer able to live independently
my mom has complained several times she
can hear the baby crying especially at
night my wife says the baby has a bad
reflux and they are trying to deal with
it the baby screams several times a day
it's awful listening to the poor thing
cry for so long it does feel like they
aren't dealing with the baby as quickly
as they should be yep you're you got a
problem you have you've you've crossed
the line
there's only one way to make your baby
stop crying reliably and they will send
you to prison for employing it you could
do you could alleviate it
trust me when I say that if it's loud
for you it's loud for the people that
are actually in their damn house
obviously you think they're not
troubleshooting it they're just like oh
I'm so sick of this baby they're doing
something
they're very aware
the baby screamed for 10 minutes solid
the other night my wife says the baby
screams when they bathe it as Annie has
told her the baby does not like being
bathed baby's always crying it is
frustrating especially when Mom needs
peace and quiet to recover from surgery
listen I get that it's frustrating
sure it's also frustrating that like you
want to [ __ ] like Fly Like a Bird but
gravity's holding you down to the rock
surface that we live on on planet Earth
sure it's disappointing that there's not
like a button on your solar plexus that
you can press when you're hungry that
makes you not feel hungry for a little
just like a snooze button on Hunger
where you could be like don't worry I'm
gonna get lunch I just need to finish
this email real quick
but unfortunately this is the world we
live in where you know that [ __ ] is
science fiction and babies also cry and
there's not that much you could do about
it I'm not saying you can't be
frustrated
but there's like there is no Upstream
problem or Upstream solution
you can't be like have you considered
feeding have you considered feeding the
baby have you considered picking the
baby up and rubbing his back
me with zero parenting advice have you
played some music that the baby finds
soothing I just thought that I would pop
in and be completely useless for a
minute
there's some Downstream Solutions you
could buy earplugs
you could move for sure but like this it
listen I know it sucks but it's just
kind of it's a damn this is the way of
the world man
if you want people out there to be like
you know cooking your French fries and
stuff like that making your coffee in 17
years you got to deal with them crying
when they're you know learning how to be
a human being
it's the way of the damn world
anyway sorry since the baby has come
home there is no longer any room on our
street during the day as we have
on-street parking
does the baby drive a Chevy Tahoe I
don't understand since the baby has come
home there is no longer any room on our
street during the day as we have on
street parking
this is making it difficult to get Mom
to appointments so she can't walk to the
end of the street to get in her car we
also can't park in the middle yeah I'm
aware you can't park in the middle of
the road obviously it's not my
suggestion here
it can take over 10 minutes to get her
in the car due to mobility issues
there's always been at least one empty
Bay outside our house but now it is
always occupied by someone from their
families or one of the other Health Care
Professionals involved in the baby's
care
it this can't be real
there is no way there is a grown man who
is like I can't I'm struggling to take
my mom to the doctor because there's
always a doctor taking care of a baby
outside of my house
what do you think that maybe like the
baby the baby doctor should get the
parking spot 50 of the time and you
should get the parkings by the other 50
of the time also this is very like I I
understand the frustration don't get me
wrong but like this [ __ ] comes up in
Vancouver all the time there's like once
a month on our slash Vancouver there's a
post that's like uh a guy came to me
when I was in my car and said you can't
park here this is my house
do I have to move and everybody's like
[ __ ] no
if you you know if you live in an area
where you don't have a driveway and
there's street parking you don't get the
parking spot in front of your house it's
just you know it it's damn listen can I
tell you I don't know if I should admit
this
sometimes you know if we're going to
like vandus and botanical gardens
basically I'm saying if you live in
Shaughnessy [ __ ] you I don't listen to
your damn rules no sign is going to tell
me what to do
I'm going to Van Duzen botanical gardens
you know it's the Festival of Lights
it's the Japanese uh Sakura blossoms or
something like that the parking is all
[ __ ] up I drive into Shaughnessy it's
the rich go [ __ ] yourself neighborhood
where they're like no never raise our
property taxes even if it will build a
hundred schools all the side streets say
you need to have a permit to park here
unless you're the homeowner
I just [ __ ] I find the first spot I put
that [ __ ] in park I walk to the damn Van
Dusen botanical gardens they can drive
around the block if they want
you're not using this spot I'm I'm
taking the damn spot
who cares
you think you think I'm gonna let it
listen I pay for parking if I park on
the street it funds Civic services like
paying for the parking attendants who
give people tickets that don't pay for
parking
me parking in front of somebody's house
who knows who's to say I'm not the owner
except for the owner but I don't know
I've never been punished yet
I'm just saying I don't buy the street
parking stuff
you own is a fake rule that's what I'm
saying
so sometimes I'll see a sign that's like
local traffic only I'm like well I'm
local traffic [ __ ] I need to be here
I I need to go for temporarily I'm local
traffic I need to be on this road to get
to another road so sorry here I go
don't worry I want to hit anything while
I'm on the road but like chill out
anyway
by the way they can be frustrated that's
fine and they have a valid reason for
their frustration
it would be nice if they could park
outside well here's what you got to do
you got to buy a second car and then the
next time the doctor gives to the
parking spot you gotta [ __ ] take that
parking spot with a car and then never
drive it again
that's it you just gotta buy another car
it's the only because here's the thing I
I know is frustrating there's like a
shared resource and you're like I need
it right now and somebody else is like I
also need it right now and you're like
well [ __ ]
that's how it works at the library of
parking
if somebody signed out 12 rules for life
then you know your ass has got to go
across town and get you know go to the
Dunbar location or something
I reached a breaking point this weekend
mom had been home alone all day and she
was in tears when I got home from work
wife was away visiting friends she said
the baby had been screaming all day long
it was still crying when I came home I
went and knocked on Bill and Annie's
door to ask if they could quiet attend
the baby
excuse me build into any
perchance could you quieten the baby
I could see through the frosted glass
that Annie was sat at the bottom of the
stairs not even trying to calm the baby
down I got a little snapshot of their
life and extrapolated that out to the
rest of the day
she was urinating not even actively
spending 24 hours a day trying to
silence their own child
when she came to the door she apologized
and said she'd been trying to calm baby
down but the new medication was making
him constipated and he was straining the
Poo she had Bill she had Bill had gone
to pick up an emergency prescription to
try and help I snapped as she clearly
hadn't been trying as she was on the
stairs and I told her they need to be
more considerate of others and if they
didn't quiet in the baby I would log a
noise complaint with the police
excuse me knock knock
Mr and Mrs Simmons um
I had a report so there's a crying baby
here
we're gonna need you to uh quieten the
baby if possible
who do you think they're gonna do like
what are the police going to do for the
baby you really think that's going to
help out the situation with two
strangers coming to the baby's room that
are like hey
sir sir
quiet that sir calm down
and he was upset and closed the door in
my face when my wife came back she told
her what I had said now my wife is angry
with me as I was making life difficult
for a young couple with a sick baby and
is giving me the silent treatment I feel
like I may be in the wrong because of
how my wife reacted but at the same time
the baby is always crying dude they need
to be more considerate of their
neighbors we go through this all the
time okay
this this comes up a lot
there's a
it's okay to be frustrated
but you have to think logically about
whether it's okay to act on your
frustration
like people get frustrated by completely
reasonable [ __ ] every day
if your neighbor is mowing his lawn at 9
00 a.m on a Sunday
and you normally get up at 10. you can
be frustrated
do you have a case to go over to his
house and say hey could you do it at 11
next time my personal opinion
9 A.M is kind of Open Season I might
even say 8 A.M is open season but I
don't want to get too many minus twos
but everybody's got their own limits for
that but there's a couple of things we
talk about if you live in like a shared
environment
you do have to be as considerate as
possible of your noise that is
preventable but you also have to be very
accommodating for the noise of other
people that is reasonable
something that not even babies because I
know you're going to be like this is
Parental take so one thing that annoys
me you know we have like a a next door
sort of like social network thing for
our building and it'll see [ __ ] on there
that's like hey there's a barking dog on
like the seventh floor and I'm like what
do you want the strata Council to do
[ __ ] like knock down the door and be
like be quiet it's a dog it's like
putting up a sign that says dogs can't
pee here well like [ __ ] watch them go
like they'd you can't stop them
so like sometimes yeah I get annoyed I
like hear I'm like man I wish that dog
would stop barking then I remember like
it's a dog and I'm like okay I guess
I'll just be frustrated and be like life
sucks for a little bit but I'll get over
it same thing with like like babies
everybody
nobody likes to hear a baby cry for the
record but there is like legitimately
like nothing you could do
if your kid's like three and they're
holding the temper tantrum
or throwing a temper tantrum there's
stuff you can do
I've I've grabbed my two-year-old and
then taken them out of a store
but at the same time like a an infant
there's nothing you could do
they simply don't respond the reasons
they don't know what you're saying
you can't reason with them all you've
got is you've got like a bottle of milk
and you got like a snack and maybe you
got like a toy and you you cycle you're
like milk
toy snack snack and milk snack and toy
toy and milk
clean diaper
like you don't know what it's like to
have
12 teeth cutting through your gums at
any given moment I'm just saying this I
guess what I'm trying to say is I have
some sympathy for the fact that it's
frustrating to deal with a crying baby
because [ __ ] I deal with a crying
baby it's my baby
it's probably less frustrating when it's
your baby but it's still [ __ ]
annoying you think it's awesome to wake
up at like 3 30 a.m to to the worst
alarm clock of all time when you were
also up at one and eleven this is
garbage no one would sign up for that
deal if evolution hadn't tricked us
you just gotta you know
if you're the neighbor you gotta put in
like a damn put on some earbuds or
something like that or move to a
detached house
I know it's not that simple but like you
know
it's a way of the damn world and then
you you look the other way when the
baby's crying and I look the other way
when it's a [ __ ] random Thursday and
you got divorced so you're playing EDM
at 110 decibels at 2 30 a.m for some
reason
this is the way community living works
you wouldn't look the other way no I
would definitely I would knock on the
door I wouldn't call the police but I
would knock on the door
I feel like a withering glance from a
neighbor is is more effective than a
than a police noise complaint
at least for like an adult if they're in
college or something maybe the police
are more effective but if you're like
the same age as the person that you're
noise complainting complaining
and you're like really brother like
we're the we're [ __ ] we were in the
same second grade class
your ass is out here drinking alone
listening to EDM on your speakers at 3am
what what happened knock it off
anyway quiet in that music
they I don't even need to read the
comments they're obviously
they're just they're just insane
am I the [ __ ] for not buying
Christmas gifts for my five-year-old
nephew but we'll buy it for all other
nieces and nephews why is this always
happen
wait a minute how about this am I the
[ __ ] for not for including my
co-worker in secret Santa when she
clearly does not want to be in it now
this is a good one for me because I need
to ask you some clarifying questions
if you add your co-worker in the secret
Santa doesn't that [ __ ] up like the
whole rotation isn't that one of those
things where everybody like needs two
dance partners
I hate buying gifts I would puke if this
happened to me I'm like a pure ass Gift
Giver for sure
I don't know if Kate's still in chat but
she'll tell you like every year for
Christmas I don't get her like a bowling
ball like Homer Simpson but around like
the end of November early December I'm
like hey I need to get you a Christmas
gift
and then she to her credit I actually
think it works pretty well because she's
like okay here's something I want and
then I get it for
which is great because it takes the
guesswork out of it it's not admittedly
it's not romantic it's
like purely like fulfilling a
transaction essentially but it works for
us
I but I and as much as that makes me
sound bad let me make myself sound worse
I think I'm actually worse as a gift
receiver than as a gift buyer
because as a gift receiver I'm useless I
am devoid of material wants
so whenever someone is like hey I need
to get you something for Christmas I'm
like
I don't really even like buy myself
anything like I buy myself food
and that's basically it I don't I don't
I don't buy like a lot I don't buy a lot
of media or like you know I'm not in the
fashion or anything like that I'm just
so that's why even my parents end up
getting me like you know Subway gift
cards and stuff like that
but I'm like most of the time spousal
gives a little different but for anybody
that's not literally like my spouse I'm
like I would actually don't be mad but I
would actually be happier if you didn't
get me anything
because if you get me something I'm
gonna then feel compelled to have to get
you something and I don't want anything
and I hate buying gifts so like you
basically by getting me a gift you've
actually given me like two and I know
how this sounds but you've created two
very very mildly unpleasant things for
me which is okay
tis the season but like
now I gotta go out and I gotta be like
what do I get for my uncle who I haven't
[ __ ] seen since 2013 I'm like I don't
know
I'm not saying nobody should exchange
gifts I'm just saying there's a
different
I'm not I'm not Ebenezer Scrooge I love
I did some Most Wonderful Time of the
Year
I'm just I would actually genuinely I
would be happier buying someone a gift
and not receiving one in return
but people don't believe me and I
understand why they don't believe me
because if someone said that to me I
would be like yeah right you're trying
to trick me into not getting you a gift
so that I like owe you a favor for the
rest of my life of course you gave me a
gift I gotta get there's no way I'm not
getting you a gift
no no you don't give me a gift you don't
get me a gift and I I will get you a
gift
anyway
it's okay it's just
I my ideal Christmas Arrangement would
be
like again people you're very close with
gift exchange otherwise at Family
Christmases
children under the age of 14
receive presents from parents
grandparents
aunts and uncles
everybody over the age of 14
two glasses of white wine and a meal
that somebody else cooked for you and
that would be a beautiful that would be
my ideal holiday experience I think
not me and my my great uncle exchanging
twenty dollar HMV gift cards to each
other for no reason letting that [ __ ]
rot in our wallet for the next 10 years
or so I always love socks yeah I I give
Second Use socks underwear
workout towels
anyway regardless am I this week we got
lost in the sauce a little bit there
am I the [ __ ] for including my
co-worker in secret Santa when she
clearly does not want to be in it
my work has seven female employees
including the two bosses that's pretty
based
needless to say we're all very close
that's not needless to say that is
you need to say that I would not assume
that just because there were seven women
working together they were all friends
I'm sexist I would assume that they're
they all talk [ __ ] about each other
behind each other's backs I'm I'm
problematic like that
I think it needed to be stated
we interact with each other on the daily
even hanging out outside of work my f-20
wait but you're literally talking [ __ ]
about their back right or behind them
about them behind their back right now
now that I think about it
I knew it I knew it this confirms my my
problematic biases
my f-26 co-worker 45 had a bad
experience with last year's secret santa
yo
Kate's mom got me a Christmas gift check
it out it sucks she knows me they do say
Canada on them too
it's cold it is
yeah our daughters baby shark shoes yeah
two-year-old shoes yeah
I look cat vomit yeah oh no but it's
like
it's like like I hate you back like that
no yeah he's just the old
it's like like the size of a loony yeah
how did he like
Tomo I don't know if Tomo has the
executive function to choose where he
throws up
he just got I just sees like
you probably put him in the washer
it's not like they can really shrink
their baby shoes
very well worn
we had split secret santa into three
weeks for the last three weeks of
December week one trinket week two
trinket week three final gift exchange
and staff dinner this company is not
gonna last through the bear Market this
is a company that can only exist in near
zero interest rate environments you are
not getting any work December you got
three
three weeks of Secret Santa
this [ __ ] sounds exhausting man
I would accept one for sure that you
know it's December take a long lunch
exchange gives it's festive but like
once a week for three weeks is crazy
also where do you buy
trinkets I don't know it's the weasel
pigeon thank you for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
like I know where to get like uh like a
main like what this is secret Santa is
what like under 30 bucks under 50 bucks
you can go to like uh Bed Bath and
Beyond or something like that you can
give somebody like a Candlestick where
are you getting trinkets
I don't understand 50 bucks listen I'm
in Canada inflation's 10 percent
Canadian dollars at uh 1.37 USD you
can't buy [ __ ] for like I know people
are saying under 20 bucks you cannot buy
anything for under 20 in Canada you
could buy lunch for
one person or possibly an adult and a
child
at least in Vancouver hey Mariko Al
thank you as well thank you
here's my everyone's like so into giving
gifts then all of a sudden they're like
50 bucks oh that's too much excuse if
you're getting a 50 gift in return
you're giving fifty dollars and you're
getting fifty dollars oh it does you'd
rather have that extra 30 difference to
get something for yourself Ergo my
problem with the gift giving experience
unsolicited
you're making my point for me
a 50 gift I don't want
you you're preaching to the choir
we never disagreed with you okay then
why am I yelling
um
this year it was sorry her first two
gifts came the following week which
ruined her experience of looking for her
it's a [ __ ] scavenger hunt is it
[ __ ] stomp she's she's gotta find
their gift as well
of looking for her gift and waiting for
it to peer during the designated week
she also felt her final gift was below
budget and not thought out a wallet as
everyone was having their own experience
admittedly we didn't notice how bad hers
was this year October we selected the
names for secret Santa that is when she
told everyone about her experience how
terrible it was mentioning multiple
times to different people and saying she
does not want to be involved this year
in charge I still put her name in the
generator okay
I would say this is the first misstep
yes
I didn't listen to all that but uh sorry
that happened to you or congratulations
or whatever
me and one of the bosses hoping to
persuade her as we made a rule in the
generator her and her past Santa would
not get each other it did not work what
do you mean the rule didn't work or she
didn't have a good time
because if the rule didn't work you
gotta you gotta work on your back end I
think
also why do you have a secret santa
generator
whatever happened it would just
cutting up although it's a secret santa
if you know who she got
you just cut up a piece of paper and
write names on it and and draw them out
of a hat
there's seven people at the office
you're telling me they need a generator
for secret Santa
it's just getting too we're two 21st
century man we forgot about the the
mundane pleasures of the 90s
instead I asked her to show me who she
got and to and decided to get the gifts
for both her and my original person
without telling her Santa that she was
not participating this was done so she
could still receive a gift without
having to put in the effort I know we're
going back to a callback here
is nothing getting done at the office
you're over complicating the seek it's
just supposed to be a nice little
diversion from the
banality of the day
now you got it turned into like a damn
it's a heist movie
late in November after people started
buying gifts she made a comment stating
she still does not only that she does
not only does she not want to be that
not only does she not want to be a part
of it but if she gets a gift she will
leave it there at work
there is no way that she would not
receive a gift
either I would have three secret Santas
or the bosses would still get her a gift
what is happening I I don't understand
foreign
it would be terrible for the next three
weeks for all to be excited about a
surprise surprise gift knowing she's not
involved or receiving her past Santa
would feel guilty and not be able to
enjoy the festivities we would feel
awkward brandishing gifts with her right
here the final brunch would be weird
after we closed work it's a it's a
brunch too I know I just keep getting
more surprised by the logistics
that [ __ ] starts at like 10 a.m on a
workout
I thought it was like uh maybe like a
1pm office lunch or something nothing's
getting nobody's getting anything done
man
this is crazy
the fine and also I know that we've
we've been through this before
you stop me if I've said that 10 times
today but this is the classic like
person who honestly says I don't want to
receive a gift
people are like I heard all that but I
don't want you to feel weird if you
didn't want me to feel weird you would
respect my wishes and you would not give
me a gift
if everybody's opening presents
and I'm sitting there I'm [ __ ] I'm an
adult I can see someone open a present
and not be like oh I wish that was me
most of the time I'm like I'm glad it's
not me
I'm good
when I'm at a restaurant and someone's
getting happy birthday sung to them I'm
like damn dude I'm
I'm glad as hell it's not my birthday
today
I'm not gonna feel weird
I will feel totally normal if you get me
a gift I would also like pretend to feel
normal too but I don't like when people
sing like happy birthday to me either
when I when I worked at that office in
Korea
my contract was like November to
November my birthday is in November so
it's like two days before I left
for home
all these people I'm never going to see
again sing me Happy Birthday
and I've sung happy birthday to like 27
people I'm never going to see again
either what a waste of of our limited
time on planet Earth
they don't and without I'm not saying
that this makes them bad people they
don't care about me they're not it's
I'm never going to see him again Abigail
teacher from dejon who I've I've
exchanged three words with in the 12
months that I worked here she doesn't
give a [ __ ] whether I have a happy
birthday I mean if you put a gun to her
head she'd probably be like I'd rather
he have a happy birthday than a bad
birthday but she doesn't really care
it's not like she's racking her brain
like how can I make and why should she
we're strangers
it's the same way when it's her birthday
I'm like yeah I mean I guess in
principle I hope she has a nice day
but like it's not like I'm I'm gonna get
anything for I'm just gonna sing the
song and let her take the first piece of
cake or whatever
not everyone feels the way you do yeah
but every
every doesn't feel the way I feel they'd
sing the Happy Birthday for them it's
not for me
it wouldn't be that bad and by the way I
had a happy birthday sung to me when it
was my birthday on the cruise I was
having a great time I wore I wore a tie
all day that said it's my big day
our room had a a magnet on it that said
it's my 34th birthday I was living it up
I was being festive
but those are I was getting a happy
birthday from my family at the table not
from my co-workers who like
I mean honestly it's been 12 years I
couldn't pick them out of a lineup now
it's a different story like it's in when
people have to sing Happy Birthday
versus like when they choose
anyway
just let her not have a present like
what's the problem
I understand her stance but at the same
time I feel like we should be free to
ignore it so that everyone can enjoy the
festivities my thoughts have even gone
so far as thinking she is selfish
because she knows how small work is and
how it will impact the holiday season
for her to not receive a [ __ ] a soap
oh liquid soap holder
that says soap on it a ceramic soap
bottle you pour liquid soap into that
says soap on it it has like a little
Olive or something
just accepting the gifts graciously is
fine because we're only doing it to make
her feel included
she wants to be excluded
she wants
she literally said don't include me
what's wrong with you you're not
listening
and we're gonna hey I know you had a bad
time last year you don't want to do it
this year we're going to force you to do
it this year to make it up to you we
aren't forcing her to buy anyone a gift
it's even worse man
because now she's going to get a gift
and have not given a gift to anybody
else so now if you were worried about
making her feel awkward her ass is going
to feel awkward because she's receiving
a gift but she didn't pay it forward
she's gonna feel like a freeloader or
she at least she's gonna feel like you
guys think she's a freeloader
as her gym partner and someone who hangs
out with her outside of work I could
never receive a gift and be excited to
talk to her about it knowing she can't
enjoy it as well and she'd have two bad
Christmases at work but maybe I'm being
selfish you've lost your damn mind
you've you've gone insane
it is so simple to just listen to
another person for something so minor as
this and be like I don't want to be a
part of it and be like that's okay I
respect that maybe I disagree with it
but I respect that you're also an adult
with you know an adult mind and and you
can make a different choice to me and
it'll be okay
she does have a terminal case of
Christmas
anyway I mean like I it's not that big
of a deal it's just like
I just don't understand why you're not
listening to her like it's crazy
she's just chilling just let her enjoy
her life I don't understand the problem
I mean I'm trying to when I worked in an
office in in Canada I enjoyed being a
team player I brought stuff to the
potlucks and you know what I ate stuff
with the potlucks can I tell you
even though 2010 I wouldn't say I was a
picky eater but more picky than I am now
I would eat some [ __ ] at the potlucks
that I didn't even think I would like at
all but I'm sitting next to the person
who made it so you know I'm getting some
potato salad you know I'm getting so
they're all salads pasta salad potato
salad
etc etc
and then you eat it and you go
wow Lori this is delicious because this
[ __ ] you're all spending seven hours
a day
checking your damn email over and over
you know just anything to get the
neurotransmitter is pumping and get some
Happy chemicals you know you today you
tomorrow me
if Lori was like don't eat the pasta
salad I'd be like why
would you do to the Lori what'd you do
to the pasta salad but I would listen to
her I wouldn't eat the pasta salad
because even if it sounds like an insane
request you know I respect where it's
coming from
you're the [ __ ] enforced fun is not
fun if she doesn't want to take part you
should have left her out yeah but
you're the [ __ ] secret santa sucks
because people often say it's voluntary
then there still ends up being
situations like this can I I think this
is a very unpopular take I can only tell
you that this is coming from a genuine
place for me I find Yankee Swap more fun
than Secret Santa
because Yankee Swap has like gameplay
secret Santa is like thank you
thank you oh I this is what I wanted
Thank You Yankee Swap is like I wonder
what the [ __ ] is in that one I'm taking
the I'm taking the media I'm giving up
my big box to take a medium-sized box
because the big boxes are always
disappointing
I've never heard it called Yankee Swap
Yankee Swap is is a white elephant where
like there's a pile of gifts and then
the first person takes a gift and then
the second person chooses whether they
want to take a different gift or if they
want to swap their gift with someone
else at the table
or at the at the event it doesn't have
to be at a table I guess
and I I think people are like it's bad
because it could like hurt feelings if
you get a great gift stolen from you I'm
like no that's why it's fun because
nobody knows who's gonna get the gift so
you're not like trying to Soul read them
and be like Oh do they want a deck of
cards with minions on it or do they want
like a bottle of perfume from Shoppers
Drug Mart right instead you're just like
[ __ ] send it what what box do you
think looks the best
it's like my chair is getting squeaky as
hell man
it's always one guy who brings something
cool well that's the office one is like
doesn't Michael give Ryan an iPad or an
iPod back when the iPods were the top of
the line
everybody else bought like you know a
deck of playing cards and a five dollar
gift certificate attached to it
I remember the the first time I played
Yankee Swap was in sixth grade I
remembered I some this is I swear to you
is true I was in the position of power
on last swap it was me and I said I'm
gonna take uh Danielle's
because it's the biggest box and
everybody was like whoa he's he got the
big box and I remember the person who
bought it was like you don't really want
the big box and I cracked that [ __ ] open
and it was like just an outrageously
large novelty pencil like that you
couldn't even write with
it's like a pencil you had to hold in
your hand like this and I was like
you know what I was owned but also I
think that gave me a new respect for the
game
that was that was like I have to
apologize to you I wasn't familiar with
your game I thought this was a big box
must be the the best gift I didn't
realize
you got to go with a medium-sized box
maybe I don't know we should do a Yankee
Swap
it's just being harassed and spending
more money at a time of year when
money's already tight and inflation is
killing everyone else so that you can
buy someone you barely know or may not
even like something they probably don't
even want yeah that's true I do want to
say there's a caveat here that like it's
it can be fun
the way I always thought about stuff
like this when I worked at an office was
like yeah I gotta spend like 20 bucks to
buy Susan who I know nothing about like
a little tchotchke or whatever but then
we get to have like an extra 45 minutes
at lunch one day where we all get to
actually like socialize with each other
so it's I mean it's kind of a [ __ ] deal
but at least you're you're getting like
something out of it on the back end but
I can understand not everybody thinks is
it's I mean I don't think it's that fun
but I think it's you know
I'm just not that serious about the
secret santa I guess forced personal
events at work are unprofessional and
toxic people should be given the choice
to say no by all means run extra events
and invite people but this is not her
job okay true so true but like come on
hey all right let's do it you're the
[ __ ] do you typically force your
holiday things on everyone or just your
co-workers even if the company is Tiny
you can't do that especially a trinket
one week real gift the next then dinner
what are you trying to court them or
something you'll be lucky to get a
homemade car for me [ __ ] you'll be lucky
if I text my co-workers anything related
to happy I'd be lucky if you shut your
damn mouth Dusty mother I don't even
know who you are you speak to me like
this
well you're not speaking to me you're
speaking the lady might be crazy you
don't have to be this mean in response
this is too much can't you just write
like you're crazy LOL
can't you just write something with a
ring like lamal lady you really thought
or something like that that would be so
much more effective than this like
Millennial Manifesto or something like
that
any not the [ __ ] in here nope none
okay
did you say that ass little bro
if you had to choose one oh wait you
don't have to with hello fresh you get
fresh ingredients and easy to follow
that's not an am I the [ __ ]
there's a lot of not the [ __ ] I
don't respect these
um dude okay this is a rehash I'd like
to apologize
am I the [ __ ] for not allowing my
sister-in-law's kids to bring their own
food to Christmas or my home what is
wrong with people in Christmas
you know what I realize is that like
some people
um
and I don't think it's like a majority
but there's a lot of them some people
are like up against the walls of Life
all the time they have no flexibility if
the current changes there's going to be
conflict again I don't know if Kate's in
chat
I'm I'm on the middle of a damn inner
tube on the world's widest water slide
and I'm not saying I never get annoyed
or offended but like if I was hosting
Christmas dinner and somebody like that
was part of my family that was coming to
Christmas dinner was like hey I don't
want to eat your turkey I'm gonna eat
like 12 Snickers instead I would be like
get it brother wouldn't be my choice but
like you're always welcome at the table
the idea and we haven't even read the
post yet but we had one of these like a
month ago but like the idea that you
have to eat what everyone else is eating
on Christmas makes it seem like it's
like a shared torture like if the food
is good why should you care if
somebody's choosing
to eat something else
are you worried somebody else is going
to look at the the food that you're
eating instead of Christmas dinner and
they're going to be like oh I should
have brought you know like a mini pizza
or something like that
then maybe next year we should just cook
12 mini pizzas that would be easy too
I'll get a probably do them in the air
fryer but I could get a toaster oven if
I got to
what's the problem
I just don't understand the issue
anyway if 31 I'm going to be honest
thing Christmas I'm going to be hosting
the Christmas celebration this year the
menu as usual and everyone's familiar
with it
maybe that's your problem maybe you got
to add in a little oat Cuisine there
maybe you gotta
you ever think about adding some uh wait
what's the hot food right now
I've been eating at a lot of family
restaurants with reasonable prices and
large portions I haven't
is there is there a big cocktail coming
off I'm still stuck in uh Moscow Mules I
think that's like 2015.
Tapas are back again I'm old this is my
second run around the Tapas cycle
broccolini you know what that's damn
true
I've been eating some broccolini lately
ipas are falling off
what about aperol Spritz are they still
popping
sloppy steaks brussels sprouts coming
back again let's go
for many of us they never left though
anyway sorry sorry
excuse me is this Tony Stark at the end
of the first Avengers movie
my sister I'm just saying she should
have added maybe like a little bit of
spice to the menu and then maybe people
wouldn't be bringing their own [ __ ] my
sister-in-law's kids are what they call
the most vicious picky eaters out there
mind you they're six and nine and are
probably just being deliberately
difficult to their parents they're just
little kids I'm gonna stop you right
there I'm not taking their side I'm just
saying if you think that the the
children have enacted a conspiracy to
uniquely harm you they're just little
kids they're just living their lives
sister-in-law called to inform me she
will be bringing food for her kids to
eat at Christmas dinner I asked why she
said they will not be able to eat
anything from the menu after looking at
it I said I'm sorry but there isn't
enough space at the table for extra
meals there's enough space for the
children to have a plate unfortunately
there's only enough space for turkey
potatoes mashed sweet potatoes with
marshmallows broiled on top of them uh
cranberry sauce gravy stuffing dinner
rolls corn carrots roasted green beans
pumpkin pie ice cream fresh fruit salad
and sparkling apple cider we couldn't we
couldn't possibly shove anything to the
side
to make space for four dinosaur chicken
nuggets and a handful of frozen french
fries
it's not possible
besides your kids should start learning
this is where you took it one step too
far lady
besides your kids should start learning
to be more tolerant to some foods
especially at family holiday Gatherings
where it's expected for everyone to just
eat what's in front of them without
complaining
that is you've taken it a step too far
I'm starting to think that you wanted
the host so that you got the hoster's
mantle which means you get the you feel
like you've got the position to say
stuff like this
she went on about how difficult kids can
be mostly can't relate but I get it no
you [ __ ] don't you
which is fine but you gotta just have
like some let me again just don't make
an unforced error
she should still keep in mind that it's
probably a passing phase for them listen
I don't know if I get anything about
kids but I'm gonna guess that this is a
phase and the exact right time for them
to get over that would be Thanksgiving
dinner or sorry Christmas dinner
let's ruin the holidays by by picking a
fight with my six-year-old and my
nine-year-old I was supposed to be a
happy day
she said I don't get it and then she
doesn't want them to stay hungry or feed
on snacks I apologize and declined my
husband got involved in this and is
saying I'm being inconsiderate towards
my guess he said I lose Nothing by
allowing them to bring food I disagree
with this is not part of my plans and if
anything should be a teachable moment
they're applying pressure on me saying
I'll ruin the celebration if I keep
trying to die on this hill
you're the [ __ ] it's not your place
to provide a teachable moment get it yes
off okay I'm listen
I think I've overloaded on [ __ ] takes
for this am I the [ __ ]
if there isn't someone bashing picky
eaters you're dead why are you
criticizing this person because I mostly
criticize picky eaters who are like over
the age of 25.
this is a six-year-old and a
nine-year-old nine-year-old kid
I'm not and the other thing is I do
still think that you know they're at the
age where you should start to try to
introduce them to like new foods and and
force their hand a little bit but that I
don't think you should do it at like
Christmas dinner in front of a bunch of
strangers I think you got to build that
scaffolding like at home where you can
be like [ __ ] try it try it
try it you can't do it at Christmas
dinner where you got to be like could
you could you just eat a spoonful
you gotta you gotta do that in your own
Arena it's got to be a home game
you'll just bring him on over Christmas
dinner that's like hey it's your first
game in the NBA suit up you're playing
starting small forward in the game seven
of the NBA Finals like you gotta
you gotta give them some time in the
training camp first
okay slash



members of react cord's demise have been
greatly exaggerated
I want you to know that when it comes to
like
streamers who love the job I think
they're streamers who tolerate it okay
and I'm not like going Super Saiyan
every single day some days I'm like I'm
okay to be here and some days I'm like
uh I'm having an amazing time like this
is the this is the meaning of my life
but I am like an hour and 20 minutes
into the stream we just got started
doing normal content but I dragged my
daughter to daycare in probably like not
exaggerating like the biggest blizzard
in Vancouver in I don't know like the 10
years that I've lived here at least is
one of the top three like almost
everything is closed
um walked all the way back and then
smashed my thumb in my own back door due
to my own uh hustle unfortunately me
being an idiot was like I'm 30 minutes
late I gotta go fast what an idiot
thumbnail turned completely white
um so I got it all gauzed up here but
yeah and I'm and I'm live
I don't ask for it too much can I get a
little easy clap in the chat
foreign
thank you thank you okay and it's not
like I don't feel like I have to be here
I feel like I want to be here and
this like I know you're on YouTube
You're gonna be like oh it's crazy how
this was like the last video he posted
before the thumb infection spread to his
brain and killed him but
hopefully hopefully that's not the case
look it's it's bad but it's not that bad
like I'm okay
I'm not going to go to the hospital for
this unless it starts to smell vaguely
of almonds but anyway
I'm feeling good
am I the [ __ ] for taking an Uber to a
wedding so I wouldn't be late my sister
got married last weekend easy clamps in
the chat please I flew into town and my
parents insisted I stay with them
instead of a hotel just like I wanted my
parents are consistently late for
everything I think it's a Latin thing
I hate being late I think it's
disrespectful all right immediately not
the [ __ ]
I know I'm late
um
a lot
but uh
listen All I'm gonna say you're not
gonna
when when it's me in charge of my own
destiny
then I'm here when I'm supposed to be
here that's what I'm saying sometimes
the baby is like you know I I'm on track
for being on time and then she has like
a third diaper in the morning or
something like that happens okay
it happens
noon rolls up and my folks oh sorry the
wedding was at 2 30. my folks live about
half an hour from the church okay in my
head here's here's how early people
think okay the wedding's at 2 30 my
folks live half an hour from the church
you do late people will be like we'll
leave it too no that's because you got
it once you get to the church you have
to park and there's going to be tons of
people parked on the street because it's
a wedding so it might take you a little
longer to to park and then you gotta
walk in and that's when the thing's
supposed to start
so you should be in your seat by then
you're not supposed to be walking in at
the same time as like the bride and the
groom right you're not supposed to be
walking in and taking your seat in the
Pew when they're playing the The Wedding
March by Methuselah what's his name
Mendelson
okay so me if it was me you live a half
an hour from the church it starts at 2
30. I would want to be there at two so I
would tell myself I would leave at 1 30.
and then my ass would be ready at
1 15. and I'd be like well what am I
going to do turn on the TV and watch 15
minutes of [ __ ] that I don't care about
so I'll be leaving the house at like
117. I'll be showing up at the same time
like they're still getting the flowers
set up and there will be nobody in the
pews and I would be like well even
though I'm here first I'm not gonna sit
at the front because they're just like a
friend of mine like that's where the
family's supposed to sit so I would be
sitting there like five pews back on the
side of the person's family that I knew
and just looking at my phone for like 45
minutes I'm not saying all early people
are like like you don't win
when you're early you usually lose
because you have to spend more time
like waiting for late people and you
know the most messed up thing about all
of it is like they're they're gonna say
that it's going to start at 2 30 but
they're actually going to start at like
2 40 because they're going to be like
this guy's parents are going to be late
so we're not going to start at right at
2 30.
so the late people get accommodated for
and the early people get uh they get it
from both sides but anyway sorry
they are adults and I am over dealing
with them hold on noon rolls up and my
parents aren't even getting ready yet I
don't listen if you are um and I
apologize for the the heteronormative
gender roles for a man to get ready for
a wedding is Max one hour if he's not in
the wedding you take a shower maybe you
have to shave and then you you find your
suit you put it on maybe you got to
steam out some wrinkles so they're not
they're not super late here at at noon
maybe maybe his mom has to you know bath
bathe dryer hair
eat some lunch or something like that
it's their daughter getting married oh
yeah wait never mind
oh yeah they
yeah like nine
and even that's kind of pushing it I got
ready I sent for an Uber I'm in the
church at two I check in with my sister
she asked if I had any problems getting
my parents to church I told her I came
by myself
and said that I was responsible for
getting them there on time
foreign in in the jungle the mighty
jungle can I get an auto correct on this
one she she turned white okay because
she was shocked
well nobody asked me to do that I didn't
even want to stay there so now everyone
starts calling my parents they're
getting ready they were about 35 minutes
late the service was shortened because
there was another wedding later that day
everyone is still mad at me for not
getting my parents there on time my aunt
said I'm an [ __ ] for messing up the
timing of the wedding my mom says it's
my fault for not reminding them to get
ready am I the only one who thinks
adults should be able to be on time for
their own kids wedding without help not
the [ __ ] cut and dried not the
[ __ ]
listen
your parents are old enough that for a
special event like this for your child's
uh wedding
I mean when are you going to learn that
your actions have consequences right
it's you should have that your parents
should have had a moment in their lives
up to this point where they were like
their lateness was tolerated and then
one day it wasn't one day they were like
I'm gonna be 10 minutes late for this
thing but don't worry it's never a big
deal and then it was a big deal and then
they go okay I have to change my life
now
I sympathize with the habitually late in
the sense that it's always hard to
change like ingrained habits in a way I
feel lucky
like I'm extremely rarely laid for
things if it's just me
but I'm lucky because that was the
lesson that was taught to me by my
parents my mom is even like a little bit
crazy about if they like have a flight
that leaves at like noon they'll be like
okay well we have to be at the airport
two hours early so we got to be at the
airport at 10
so we're going to have it's a 30-minute
drive to the airport so we're going to
leave at 4 38 maybe we should just sleep
in the Airport overnight you know
so that is the lesson that was passed on
to me and I peeled back some of it to
preserve my sanity
it is hard to change your habits if
you're like if you're habitually late
I'm sure but like
I don't know it's like this is the other
people have stuff to do too
maybe your parents are a hundred
that seems unlikely do you know that if
you looked at the demographic breakdown
of the world you know what percentage of
the population is a hundred years old
it's like
0.05 of the population everybody knows
like one 100 year old but think about
how many people you know that are not
[ __ ] a hundred like all of them
except for
statistically speaking Aunt Ruth
are there more 100 year olds or people
that are seven feet tall
that's a great question
that is that's a fantastic question
I bet there's more 100 year olds
you could you could do a back of the
napkin calculation
what percentage of
adults are seven feet or kids I guess
what like what are what's the proportion
of seven feet tall individuals
it's got to be like one in ten thousand
or something like that maybe even less
and then how many people live to be a
hundred years old it's got to be
well I don't know I feel like one in ten
thousand might might be a bit of a
stretch but
I that's a real question how many 100
year olds are seven feet tall I think I
feel pretty comfortable saying the
answer there is like probably
zero
especially because you shrink as you get
older lots of people 6 11 or or around
there but
yeah also if you're 100 years old no one
cares but first off you you the sister
will be getting married no nobody that
is 100 years old has a kid that's
getting married where their sibling is
contemporary enough to be like I'll just
take an Uber
they would be in a horse-drawn carriage
and it's a fundamentally you're begging
the question why are you so slavish to
the three-question format
anyway this is uh this is a good way to
get started because this is uh this is
cut and dry not the [ __ ]
like I can see why people would be like
a little bit annoyed like that because
listen you did kind of you let your
parents take the shot
now your parents got in front of the
bullet don't get me wrong the the nicest
thing to do
would be to show up with them and then
when they were like why are you late be
like why do you think and everyone would
know everyone would know without even
having to say it
it's the subtext that adults speak with
every day okay
everyone would laugh
but I don't think you did any you did a
disservice by making sure that you made
it in time to see your sister get
married
you could start to but here's the thing
so people always say that you know if
you know there's going to be late people
tell them that it starts 30 minutes
early I feel like that's like
though I feel like if I tried that the
one time I did it they would show up on
time and be like yo what the [ __ ]
and also now I gotta keep like 20 lies
in my head oh the latest person I told
him it was going to start an hour before
it started then like this person's like
a little late so I told him it was going
to be 15 minutes before it's just too
much to keep in to keep track of you
know
foreign
the risk of making them the main
character right because if they're a
late person
and you tell them to be there at an
early time when it's not actually like
to preempt it then they're like oh well
next time when if they tell me the time
I'm just going to show up 30 minutes
later because I know you give everybody
the
the 30 minute extra window at the start
you're starting an arms race
there are three thousand seven feet tall
people in the world and 500 000 hundred
year olds okay 100 year olds win now
here's another question if you put all
the people who are seven feet tall on
one side and all of the 100 year olds on
the other who wins the tug of war
might sound crazy
I honestly think I would go with the 100
year olds even still
just due to sheer numbers
I mean it's like a 150 to 1. do you
think you could if if you were seven
feet tall it's an honest question we're
doing thought experiments okay you know
why
I'm delirious
do you let's let's not even assume
you're seven feet tall do you think you
could beat one versus 150 a hundred year
olds in a tug of war
on it because I I don't feel comfortable
saying that
I think that the average 100 year old is
probably
more than one percent strong as I am
which means if you add up 150 I mean I
don't exactly know how the physics work
but
all you need is like one 100 year old
that's 10 of your strength and then it's
it's over for you let me put it that way
once one falls down it's all over
yeah
listen we're verging into slightly
offensive territory okay if there's any
100 year olds watching this right now
I'd like to apologize
it's it's sobering to think of the fact
that you would be born in
1922
think of all the things you've seen
my God Calvin Coolidge the presidency of
Calvin Coolidge
did you know that Calvin Coolidge had a
a reputation for being humorless when he
was the president something that to be
honest
I look back on with a little wistful
fondness I wish that was us now we could
use a little bit of that in the modern
era
um
Calvin Coolidge had a reputation for
being humorless in a public relations
campaign he tried to uh
reverse that image and make himself seem
a little bit cooler ironically by
throwing a party on the White House lawn
New York Times reported on the party you
know what the headline was
president nearly laughs I miss the era
man
I missed the era when when the world's
biggest newspapers were just wilding out
just owning people left right in the
center thank you for asking Kate I think
my thumb
I I don't think it's great but I do
think it's
it's not going to be as bad as I thought
it was going to be
but it's not great
what happened to it
I kind of smushed it in the in the back
door like between the I had it where the
the hinge is and then I closed the door
on it by accident
and then the nail turned completely
white and we put some gauze on it I mean
I've got it no someone tried to steal
our daughter on the way to daycare and I
went Jonathan
I know you're like you're Delirious
because of the painkillers brother I
took one Tylenol
you know people be waking up with a
headache taking two Tylenols I took one
little red
like an easy swallow tab
I do think it's realistic that I lose
the thumbnail though I don't I
when I looked like
you when you take and I apologize on
YouTube you're probably like please give
us some more like content but this is my
content for today okay
I the what you got to use the adrenaline
you have when you hurt yourself
so I went upstairs uh holding my thumb
and I looked at Kate and the first thing
I said is like with with the most calm
demeanor I could muster I said don't
freak out I hurt my thumb really bad and
then I just went to the bathroom and
started running cold water on it
and then I was like I was running the
sink on top of it
and she was like your thumbnail is
completely white and I I had to resist
every uh impulse in my body to be like
yeah I know
[Laughter]
but what do I it's not like she's gonna
whisper and she's gonna be like neeta
hoota fish star and then the thumb's
gonna be like better like what is she
supposed to say
she's supposed to say does it hurt it's
the same thing I'll be like yeah
obviously it's like nothing she could
have said where I would have been like
thank you for your healing incantation
right
and then she looked she wrapped it up so
like there's a Band-Aid under this too
oh anyway not the [ __ ] if they need
to be reminded to get ready on their
daughter's wedding day they need a lot
live-in caretaker unless you were
specifically asked to get them to the
church that's not your job if your
sister thinks you messed up by messed up
the Wedding by being on time I think
it's a good time for some space between
you and your family
that might be a little much but uh
I do understand where you're coming from
I mean the sister sisters just you gotta
recognize that there's some collateral
damage here that's not your fault but I
could see why people would be mad you
know that your sister's like oh Mom and
Dad didn't make it to my wedding on time
and it's kind of like you know I thought
it was your responsibility
can't stop roasting me she's in chat
going he just kept saying ah
yeah I was going I was I did on my head
bowed
while running the the sink on my thumb
going
I wasn't going ah but I was going ah
this is it it hurt
and it still hurts but it's not like I
wasn't just doing it for
you know for humor's sake
and then Kate did I did you see or maybe
you didn't see then like I was telling
the story about crushing my freaking
thumb into the door and then Tomo threw
up in the corner like on open mic and
then so I got up I got the paper towels
and cleaned it everyone's like most
cursed stream I've ever seen in my life
and then when I sat back down I grabbed
my muffin to take a bite and I dropped
it on the floor it's like it's
it's just not my day today
thank you
not the [ __ ] if they wanted you to do
that they should have asked in advance
where's the like this one's honestly
like your base
letting someone experience the
consequences of their actions is is the
natural way that it's supposed to work
now like if it was a child you're
supposed to build some scaffolding there
you're supposed to let them make
mistakes in a way that doesn't actually
like you know impact their life too much
but like if you're in your 40s your 50s
or your 60s then yeah you know
what did you think like people were just
going to be like oh that's just I love
them because they're late no they're
going to be like this is annoying so
like get out of here
okay so the comments do not disagree
everyone told me the comments were going
to disagree the comments do not disagree
do you still have your life insurance
just checking no ironically are that
that policy has not kicked in yet
I need to have a nurse come to our house
and and take a blood in your ensample
she wants a blood sample I'll just stick
my hand out the window right now
she wants a urine sample of wring out my
underwear
oh
am I the [ __ ] for not wanting my
husband to go to his ex's funeral
yeah yeah yeah
holy cow this is a long one
bro like she's dead you won
what do you mean he's not allowed to go
to the funeral
I'll admit I'm biased right off the bat
I couldn't stand her I call her his ex
to myself and others he called her his
friend we were all in our 40s she died
recently aneurysm I've been with him for
10 years now but he'd known her for 20
plus with none of this like the aneurysm
part sure not that we really deserve to
know because this is a complete stranger
but simultaneously like uh
like this is way too much information
that doesn't matter at all can you
imagine if it did say she died thumb
indoor oh man the way he tells it they
were friends in college decided decided
to date got married and then realized
they weren't a great couple and decided
to just be friends all that happened
years before I met him he was clear
early on that she was important
a couple months into dating it came up
that his friend was actually his ex-wife
okay he's I see he explained
the above to me
saying she was one of his closest
friends and it was purely platonic I
expressed some discomfort in him being
so close to his ex
and he told me that's fine if you have a
serious issue with it let me know and
save us some time I'll choose her I like
you and all but I've known her for over
12 years and she's one of the most
important people in my life you'll have
to be okay with that if you want us to
be a thing okay
this is kind of a giga Chad but at the
same time like
he set his boundaries early
and she went with it when we were
engaged I asked again he gave me this
perplexed look and asked why would us
getting married affect my friendship I
sucked it up and went along I resented
every moment of knowing her especially
when we had to be social she understood
some part of him I couldn't her husband
was friends with mine as well so it's
not like I could use him as an angle
what does that mean
as an angle why are you using a human
being as an angle
I sort of don't even understand the
question
this is a fake story I I don't know
would you skip it give it a little extra
time
what is this r slash hell taker post uh
isn't hell taker that good but also
incredibly horny steam game
is it it doesn't appear to be not safe
for work I also see Robocop on it
he'd have lunch with his ex then they'd
go to their geeky movie okay I think
you're right I think this is designed
this is designed to make people upset
as soon as she said geeky movies
nobody's making a post on Reddit like
they're Rachel McAdams from uh Mean
Girls
they'd go see their their geeky movies
Thor Ragnarok and so on such the Batman
the few times I brought it up he said
we've had this conversation before you
had your chance to back out
she died after they had lunch the other
day on the way to her car he spent a
bunch of time crying but honestly I was
relieved you're just like not you're
this is made up I'm other people might
fall for this I'm not gonna fall for
this that's crazy he spent a bunch of
time crying I was released
[Laughter]
oh man
shh
here's one that this this has got to be
bald posting right am I the [ __ ] for
saying I won't come to Christmas at my
in-laws if I can't wear a hat
I gotta know
this is a petty little thing but maybe
you guys could help me know if I was in
the wrong for context I 25f got married
in November okay maybe not bald posting
my mother-in-law doesn't really like me
even trying to steal the spotlight at my
wedding but it's still overly
traditional at Thanksgiving I was having
a really bad hair day so I wore a black
leather cap a dressier news boy style
one oh no dude
oh no
I'm sorry I'm sorry
it's okay everything's we're gonna be
okay which my husband said looked great
on me the holiday was hostile even more
so than prior Gatherings that I'd been
to and my hubby said her mother-in-law
his mother-in-law said it was because I
wore a hat but I know it was just an
excuse I told mother-in-law I wouldn't
come to Christmas with them and then
blocked her number and her Facebook
my husband is trying to keep us both
happy because he doesn't like conflict
he wants me to come to one more
celebration to see if maybe people are
getting used to me he told his mother
she needs to be nice and treat me as
part of the family since I am and if I
feel unwelcome at Christmas like I did
at Thanksgiving that we won't attend
future events and she won't see him much
anymore I understand why he wants me to
go give them one final chance and
haven't had any conflict with him
marriage is about compromise and I get
that he doesn't want to cut her off
since she's his mother but I just don't
want to be involved with her unless I
have to be okay but like what does this
have to do with a hat so far like it's
it doesn't really seem like this is
entirely driven by the Hat it seems like
she was just like disrespectful to you
I will say like
I outside winter summer I'm wearing a
hat
I do have to I had to remember that
like there are people who consider hats
disrespectful like I remember Kate we
had dinner with my parents friends
and the the dad was like because you're
the son of my friend I'll let you wear
your hat inside but otherwise I wouldn't
I was just like some people are very you
know it was his house I was you know in
my head was I like that's a little bit
weird yeah but at the same time I was
like all right wait I mean
is yours your house your rules and I'll
probably never see you again anyway
which is fine
and then I've also like uh you know I
realized I shouldn't be wearing uh the
the my Canadian hat on the Disney
Cruisers because apparently my server
thinks I'm wearing marijuana based
paraphernalia but anyway that you know
that's beside the point I suppose I'm
mostly just looking for a chance to
reference it and tie it back into
earlier content
I wanted to see if mother-in-law was
listening to him so I asked my husband
to request that I'd be allowed to wear
the same hat to Christmas hubby said I
thought I'd worn it because I had a bad
hair day but this time it's as a
statement that they shouldn't treat me
as an outsider either because I wear
hats all the time right now it's just a
sports visor which I'd never wear to a
holiday so it's not like I'm doing that
[ __ ] like when when she says right now
it's a sports visor she's talking about
the hat that she's wearing while she's
writing the post
am I correct in in putting this in
context yes okay it's
all right
uh or they just don't like me if they
won't let me wear a hat what else are
they going to restrict about me let me
be me or I won't come period
my husband agreed and realizes of course
he did
because you're like no offense you're a
little insane which is fine everybody's
crazy in their own way but I understand
he's like it's you know just let her
wear the hat
rather than getting like a two hour long
argument about whether a visor is a is
really a hat or you know etc etc
my husband agreed and relayed this to
his mother and she's been asking him why
he married the devil he's growing tents
with me and I told him he'll probably
have to pick a side sooner or later and
that I never intended it that way he
spent last night at a friend's house
because he needed to think I feel bad
because I care about him and I know
conflict stresses him out well at least
you're picking like some serious battles
at least you're not stressing him out
for no reason over something Petty
you waited until you just couldn't take
it anymore until some very serious
differences in values came to a head and
then and you know it's important it's
important to work through that stuff
I feel bad because I care about them I
know conflict stresses him out I told
him to text me when he's ready to talk
he hasn't yet
my friends my friends think my hat
request was unnecessary and maybe I
strained my relationship with my husband
I think he just needed space to think
because conflict stresses him out so I
gotta ask am I the [ __ ] for saying I
won't come if I don't wear a hat
update my husband just texted me saying
he got off the phone with his mother he
told her off for calling me the devil
and said if I can't wear a hat he's not
coming either and then she really should
get over her Antiquated BS she did not
respond well I don't think we're going
to Christmas there now so we'll maybe
we'll have a friend's Miss I don't know
we'll think of something so I think that
this person is not necessarily
picking their battles appropriately I
don't really think that they're being an
[ __ ] I think that like it's the same
situation or a very similar situation
to maintain some form of like
you know cognitive resonance
as when somebody wants to bring their
own food to a holiday if I'm okay with
somebody bringing
a garden salad or samosas or you know
connect abroad or whatever to Christmas
why should I not be okay with someone
bringing a hat if they're if they're
most comfortable in a hat why not let
her wear a hat
I think it's weird
and then you know like maybe after you
left my house I might be like
if I was her husband I'd be worried
because I don't have a flat brim
and a snapback
um I'd be worried that maybe like one
day she would like leave me for her hat
or something like that might make some
sort of joke about it some sort of
some sort of insults you know but I
would still welcome them to Thanksgiving
and then just maybe make one
hat-based joke about them after they
left
to which the other people at the party
who are still there would say you're bad
and I would go I'm just saying I'm just
saying
I shouldn't say it
I shouldn't say it
I don't think there I mean this is just
weird
it's just I like
I don't know what to say like on the
other side
like I feel like the if it's your house
you do have the right to say you can't
wear a hat in my house
but at the same time you shouldn't be
surprised if people are like well I'm
not going to come to your house then
you got the right I mean you got the
right to do a lot of things that will
like alienate people and leave you with
like no friends at Christmas time
it's not like it's gonna be they're
gonna put you in prison for it but they
might be like man if I could choose to
spend time with someone on the holidays
she's she falls out of my top eight you
know what I mean
I do want to see the Hat Man
I hate how she described the head I
think that's that's really why I found
myself almost wanting to say everybody
sucks here
is when she was like it's a dressy
leather Newsboy cap that's where I was
like I can't you remember when the those
photos on Twitter that are like what was
what were we thinking in 2009 and it's
uh
you know 50 Cent where he's dressed like
uh he's in peaky blinders and stuff like
that
1990s Christina Aguilera Vibes that's
there's definitely I'm picturing
Christina Aguilera from uh
from the dirty tour the dirty tour
is it Aguilera Christina Aguilera
Aguilera Aguilera
introducing Christina Aguilera Aguilera
I think I grew up saying Aguilera is
that how it said
the wickedly talented Adele desim
I can't read all that I'm sorry
that's just it's just going by too fast
it's too much
everybody sucks here you took a
situation that could have been a first
step towards a less contentious
relationship with your mother-in-law and
made demands which intentionally
antagonized her of course you should be
able to whatever where be able to wear
whatever you want and your mother-in-law
is being insane but do you want to be
right or do you want peace in the family
well she wants to be right
absolutely
I think that's that's very clear
just the way that she said if it's not
the Hat then what else is it going to be
well it seems like it's going to be
whatever else you let it be but that's
fine I mean you did it's the same you
should be able to show up for the
holidays like whatever you're
comfortable in
I I again I don't know if it's just like
a generational difference but I feel
like most people like my age
if you if I went to Christmas dinner and
I was like wearing a suit
and then my brother-in-law was wearing
like a bathrobe I would be like get it
brother
oh I wasted all this time putting on a
suit and you're wearing a bathrobe who
the [ __ ] cares
the Earth is warming at like 0.25
degrees annually we got other [ __ ] to
worry about like I'm just you just eat
the dinner it's not a big deal like
the animals are leaving and
just seems like this like I don't care
maybe he just wants to be comfortable
that's what we were saying I know I was
talking about it with Apollo
but he was like nothing should have a
dress code even like funerals and I was
like that's a little bit too far for me
but like at the same time why is he
wrong
if someone wants to show up to like
their family's funeral in in socks and
sandals and cargo shorts like the day is
already hard enough like who who gives a
[ __ ]
oh you're not taking it seriously
because you don't have sleeves on your
legs
maybe it's a little weird
it's disrespectful bro is respectful to
like answer your family's calls you know
it's respectful to when it snows to like
shovel their driveway
who cares what you wear to the funeral
like listen I would wear a suit but if
somebody showed up in like a Hawaiian
shirt I wouldn't be like oh they're
celebrating
I would be like their ass was probably
late and they were like well it's
between the it's between my pajama shirt
that says baby dick and uh the Hawaiian
shirt and at least the Hawaiian shirt
has buttons
you know it's just I'm judgmental but
I'm not judgmental in that way I'm more
judgmental that like you know I'm like
why are you walking down the middle of
the grocery aisle when implicitly
they're supposed to be like a left side
and a right side for two different
directions of traffic to move through
like are you nearsighted and far-sighted
so you have to be standing exactly in
the midpoint of the aisle so no cards
can get past you in either direction
hold on I got a little hangnail here the
the day's tragedies never cease men
who asked that's that's fair that's fair
not another nail
am I the [ __ ] for telling my
husband's daughter to stop calling me
Mom
we've seen these too much like I can't
go back with this
I can't do that how about this okay
there's the two good ones am I the
[ __ ] for asking my daughter for help
11 000 upvotes certified [ __ ] okay so
this is
I love this title
oh I'm the [ __ ] for asking for help
and then everybody read the post and
said yep yep
that is true something tells me they're
misrepresenting the the situation
wanted to clarify two things I'm her dad
not sure why everyone keeps referring to
me as her mother
everyone keeps telling me the grade due
date is actually the post date if I was
allowed I would post a link so you could
see the calendar literally says December
9th 19th grades due from faculty and
December 20th grades posted she
literally admitted to lying that they
were due Sunday today so I'm not sure
why people are so stuck on insisting I'm
wrong about that
okay I'm 54 and my daughter is 28 she's
home on break from grad school getting
her PhD she's only home for two weeks
because she said she doesn't have any
more time even though she has a month
break that's been a big thing your
daughter is an adult by the way your
daughter is 28 years old
why are you being so like
I don't know why are you why are you
telling me the story expecting that
other people would be like yeah that
seems normal wow dude y'all dude your
daughter sounds like a total [ __ ]
you're right
laughs
get her ass
that's been a big thing with her lately
she's constantly too busy to do things
with us or help us out even though she
does have the time
I got my younger daughter a sweater and
it turns out she already has it I called
my older daughter from work on Friday
and told her she needed to run and
exchange it for a different one bro
buddy that's your problem no wonder
she's saying she's too busy you [ __ ]
up and now she's got to go to the mall
on like December 17th or something like
that
you calling her when she's at work
go from from your work while she's just
getting her PhD just just living her
Salad Days
she said okay she'd do it the next day I
said it needed to be done that day to
get the best options
you listen by December 18th all the
sweaters are gonna be gone everybody
knows Peak sweater buying day is
December 17th
this is crazy
I told her I need to be done that day to
get the best option she said she was
grading so she can't I told her it's not
like she can't pause her grading run out
and exchange it she said she said she
wasn't going to slow down her work and
just said that I should do it when I got
back from work I said I was busy and I
don't feel like running out after a long
day of work and she said neither did she
but she doesn't have a long day at work
she's sitting on her on her computer all
day and doesn't even have scheduled
hours to work she can do it whenever she
wants holy cow
if this is real this guy is uh father of
the year for sure
today things really kicked off because I
needed her to pick up an online order
for a gift for my mom her grandma she
again used the excuse of grading she
hadn't even started working yet it was
in the morning as she was drinking
coffee and having breakfast
[Laughter]
oh man this is so good
she said that she needs to have her
grades done today but I looked it up on
the website because I'm insanely busy
and she has until Monday evening so I
called her on her BS and she said she
had other work due on Monday oh
apparently you don't just have like one
thing to do apparently she's got like
multiple things to do and not all of
them are like listed on the website or
something
she had other work due on Monday so she
needed to get the grading done today but
wouldn't enlighten me on what this
mysterious other work is because she's
28 years old and honestly it's none of
my business I said well tough Grandma's
gift needs to be picked up today even
though it's like nine days till
Christmas
all this [ __ ] needs to be done today
doesn't actually have to be done today
if it's got to be done I can't even get
through the post if you got it if it's
gotta be done today that you do it
if it doesn't if it doesn't have to be
done today then you don't you can
delegate maybe and maybe out of the
goodness of their heart they'll help you
out but
this is crazy man
so I can wrap it and I was going into
the office so I couldn't do it she said
that if I don't want to do it myself
then it will be done on her own time
also I told her with that attitude she
can stay somewhere else she said happily
and packed she she said she called my
bluff and I was like oh [ __ ] my wife is
gonna be furious and I tried to walk it
back but she was already gone
uh it's packed her things claiming she
didn't want to stay here anyway and was
only doing so because I insisted she
left her gifts and said not to expect
her for the holidays she'll just go to
her girlfriend's family instead I think
it's ridiculous that she's throwing a
fit just because she can't constantly
live like she's the only person on the
planet but my wife and other daughter is
now furious with me which I think is
crazy but that's you know a subject for
a completely different post
so I figured I'd ask here because my
younger daughter is always reading the
stories with me am I the [ __ ] or am I
correct because them correct that my
daughter is self-centered and childish
holy cow
I mean if this is real this guy is he's
out of touch and he's also out of time
no matter what you you unless you have
and this is toddler posting okay
please do not describe an adult's having
enough of being mistreated as a tantrum
okay
tantrum and and Kate will tell you this
is when
my daughter is like I want chocolate and
I'm like you can't have chocolate until
you get in the high chair not you can't
have chocolate but you can't have
chocolate until you get in a high chair
and then she spends like five minutes
going ape [ __ ]
and I'm like literally it's a five
second chore maybe 10 seconds now but
otherwise it's a five second chore that
we can do and then we can give you the
chocolate but like the two-year-old
brain doesn't understand
you know the the cause and effect
relationship there okay
because she's two no I mean adults can
throw a temper tantrum it reminds me of
that lady at Jay Willis who started to
cry when she got served her hamburger on
sourdough bread instead of a hamburger
bun
I think of it all the time I refer this
is a second reference to it today quite
frankly I think
[Laughter]
it keeps getting lit up maybe she was
just having a hard day yeah whatever you
know lots of people have hard days you
know what they do they do you know what
make your day easier you eat the damn
you just eat the damn bread it's the
same chemical composition
just got a couple extra sour molecules
or something
I'll write it I'm eating the muffin that
fell on the damn floor dude
it's damn good
anyway what do you mean which means
she's allergic to sour
the hell are you talking about I made
that comment up I just thought it would
be funny
anyway
no you're the [ __ ] I mean I don't
even know what you can say about this
situation
is literally so annoying
someone's like hey I so I this let me
tell you something okay
almost everybody thinks that they're
busy the whole time I actually am but
almost everybody thinks that they're
busy the whole time
from from about age 16 until death okay
so I understand
that when you I think you're busy and
then you're like ah here's another
[ __ ] thing to do you're like ah I'm
I'm too busy to do that [ __ ] so you are
then like immediately like how do I get
out of this [ __ ] because I'm too busy to
deal with it so you try to like put it
off on somebody else but like you can't
put it off on somebody else for one and
then especially with like an urgent time
constraint on it unless like for a dumb
reason hey Grandma you know hop behind
the wheel of the car and crash into a
light post can you go meet her at the
hospital I'm busy okay well you gotta go
like that one's just like literally you
got that one you gotta bite the bullet
on hey I accidentally buy your sister a
sweater she already has can you go to
the mall and uh exchange it for me for a
new one yeah I'll do it tomorrow
unacceptable obviously that you're crazy
you've lost your mind
so like I I'm assuming that this is a
real post and is not bait I'm sure there
probably are people like this in real
life but I'm sure that even just saying
I'm sure that there's people like this
in real life is just confirming my own
bias which basically I want to believe
that there's someone like this in real
life so that I can light them up
anonymously through the internet but
anyway
these are we don't even need to read the
comments here because the comments are
going to go over the top they're
basically going to tell this guy to you
know like punch his own ticket
you're the [ __ ] am I correct that my
daughter is self-centered and childish
nope that's a mirror you're looking at
okay like see this is just the kind of
like
it's like this is what is this like a an
insult rap competition
your mother is so
fat that when she sits around the house
she eats more calories than she needs to
putting her at a thermodynamic Surplus
in spite of her relative sedentariness
foreign
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
it's awfully hot coffee pot
you're the [ __ ] this must be a joke
first suggesting that sitting at a
computer isn't worked slash hard work
this is definitely a Discord admin I
mods I didn't say mod I said Discord
admin they they've got other stuff to do
the mods are doing hard work
thumb
what's wrong with what this is what you
want to see
there's nothing wrong with that
oh just kidding I remember that the tape
was on there
um
my friend who is a radiologist
always works from bed in his PJs and a
bag of chips and makes close to five
hundred thousand dollars reading images
my husband is a lawyer and most days he
is in his PJs in bed writing some
comments for the top law firm in the
country you think if your husband works
at the top law firm in the country he
wants you like identifying him like this
I'm not saying it's like a big deal
necessarily but like if you just said
he's a lawyer that's one thing if you
said he's the top law firm in the
country like we could probably figure
out who your husband is and then like
I'm not saying it would reflect badly on
him necessarily but some people might
find it reflect badly on him
also is that true about a radiologist
I thought a radiologist was like
handling the x-rays like in the hospital
aren't they aren't they configuring the
machine and stuff like that and then
and then telling you that don't worry
it's it's a very small dose of radiation
and then getting in a lead-lined room
and hitting a button that goes
that's the tech okay
and then they just send like the they
send the pictures over Discord to
someone at home in their pajamas and
they go yeah his thumb's broken
pretty much okay
not too far from the truth no it's not
so bad not so bad
I thought that's dude like this is my my
whole uh thesis on the medical industry
is that you should like um just min max
for the easiest job that pays the most
money and I always thought people go
like um become an anesthetal an
anesthesiologist that's crazy you got
people's lives in your hands you're like
you know Miss a decimal point and you
know people are waking up real groggy
I don't want to be an anesthesiologist I
feel like being a podiatrist wouldn't be
that bad
you know you get you get doctor money
you do see I'm not saying it's a walk in
the park but pun intended you're going
to see some people's like really messed
up feet
you're going to see funguses and you're
going to see injuries that'll be you
know the first couple of months on the
job will probably make you cringe until
you get desensitized to it but like at
least you're very rarely I think are you
going to see someone's foot and be like
you have to break the news that they're
dying you know you're not gonna have to
nobody's coming in with the sniffles and
and getting you like infected with RSV
they're just going you know hey here's
my trench foot you know
so you think I'm not saying you don't
have bad stuff come in but it's it's
that like a relative
happy Zone you know it said it's at a
it's in the Goldilocks zone
that's just my two cents
the road Specialties are Radiology
Ophthalmology
anesthesiology and dermatology they are
considered to have the cushiest lives of
within the medical profession because
I'm not saying it's like you could have
a cushier life you could just be you
know like Paris Hilton or whatever but
Ophthalmology I could not do I could not
I don't think I would enjoy looking at
someone's [ __ ] up eyeball I mean I
don't I don't think I could the enjoy is
not even the right word and if I had to
do like a eye surgery that's one of the
things I just thought I don't think I
have the stomach for
a podiatrist I think I could because a
foot is just like
I don't know it's weird to say but I
don't really consider my feet like part
of my body
they're just like
they're like equipment you know like
I know they are but like not as much as
like you know my eyes are
or like my tongue or something like that
a [ __ ] up foot could be gnarly yeah
but What's it gonna look like you know
it's gonna look like a pretzel or
something like that a [ __ ] up eyeball
and then you gotta Shine the Light in it
and I'm seeing like little worms
swimming behind the the cornea or
something I can't do that man
what about foot fungus please I'm not
saying it would be like a the greatest
day of the office I'm just saying in the
spectrum of things that doctors have to
deal with I would rather deal with
[ __ ] up feet over [ __ ] up eyeballs
I'm glad that there's somebody out
that's a hero out there dealing with the
messed up eyeballs
I personally would rather deal with the
messed up feet
you never you ever see a nail curl in
you ever you ever slam your thumb into a
back door
watch the nail in in a single
millisecond turn from pink to pale white
because I have
merely one hour and 44 minutes ago
my thumb is is more part of my body than
my damn foot by the way
although I'll be honest if I had to
choose this injury to happen to my thumb
or my foot I guess I would rather choose
my thumb
because at least like your feet have got
to be in shoes if you're going outside
at least your thumb can kind of like
free ball it
although I might want to wear some
gloves
I can always just keep my hand in my
pocket or something like that
and the other one is Haley and uh taxi
cab
you've never seen Barefoot Tick Tock bro
I watch TLC uh my feet are killing me
sometimes you see some gross stuff I'm
just saying like I would rather see
messed up shoes than be like a general
practitioner and be like hey we got the
lab results back you're gonna die
oh I'd rather fall on the grenade of
like brother your foot is messed up
I'm not going to be able to sleep
tonight
oh there's some real heroes do the
like give the bad the truly terrible
news
just be out here like holy cow you gotta
drive between your toes when you get out
of the shower my dude
am I the [ __ ] for telling my niece
she can leave after she went against the
rules in my home which she was staying
in rent free
people love owning a home just so they
can kick people out I've never kicked
anybody out of my house
that being said we've never really had
any visitors
we moved in like two months before
kovitz started and then had a baby so
I guess you know
I would be in prison if I kicked anybody
out pretty much but anyway
um if you kept your shoes on I'd
probably kick you out especially with
all the snow on the ground don't even
get me started with people who keep
their shoes on in the house
is weird
what are you gonna do kick me out with
your bare feet bro I'm wearing socks
it's a little chilly down here on the
hardwood
I can only assume by the way I'm looking
at similar to this post r slash face
palm
no
basic bodily functions allowed I'm going
to assume that this is a toilet that
says please do not urinate or defecate
in the toilet
I'm just guessing
ETA edit to
add when I said no socializing I meant
no one at my house she can go out with
anyone she wants no issue that's that's
very big of you throwaways I'm 30. my
husband is 34 and my niece is 22. okay
our niece Amy here we go here we go bust
out the Punnett Square
my husband's
half-brother's daughter
my husband's half-brother
which is not the same as a stepbrother a
half-brother is like say one same parent
one stranger parent okay
stayed at our home recently for almost
two weeks she had exam season at College
her school is a bit of a drive from
where she lives and she'd be losing a
lot of studying time going back and
forth so she asked if she could stay
with us as we're nearby she didn't pay
any type of rent but did reimburse the
increase in utilities she offered by the
way we didn't ask her to
I think
having families stay at your house and
expect if they're staying at your house
for an Extended Stay of
I'm going to say more than six weeks
maybe you could start to talk about
we need some sort of reimbursement two
weeks is well within the grace period of
[ __ ] off
two weeks is within the Goldilocks zone
of just normal conventional hospitality



even utilities is kind of crazy how much
electricity and water is is this lady
using in two weeks she could buy you
like a nice bottle of wine or take you
out for a dinner or something like that
on the last day but
really like
she created crypto
I know power costs different stuff in
there it costs different amounts of
different parts of the world but the
water portion of our like power bill is
literally like less than I don't know
two dollars a day
and as with two adults and a toddler I
take a shower every day obviously I'm
drinking a lot of water
he was in the washing machine in the
dishwasher and so on and so forth we're
not going to send her an invoice every
day for like 60 cents like it's just not
worth the paper and the ink man
what I'm trying to say is you're not I
get that you're trying to make yourself
seem like a [ __ ] hero but you're not
a hero for letting your niece stay with
you for two weeks and only charging her
for utilities okay
that's literally just normal well it's
actually more than normal the charger
for the utilities but regardless
we agreed because this was for an
educational purpose and I made it very
clear she couldn't be using this time
for socializing mingling and so on Amy
agreed to everything
last week I came home from work and saw
Amy's husband in the kitchen
she's socializing she's socializing with
the with the member of the opposite sex
in my household in my household
he'd come with a report she'd left at
home I asked her what the hell is going
on here she said she made him coffee
since he made the trip and he's only
here for 30 minutes I reminded Amy we
allowed her to stay here to make her
studies easier not so she could be
bringing men over
I've also discussed this with her
beforehand and she agreed but now she's
going against it she probably did not
assume because she lives in the real
world she didn't assume you meant you
cannot see her husband for two weeks
when you live here are you crazy
you've been like don't throw a party
with like the other kids in your class
the other adults in your class I guess
she is 22 but like is her husband coming
over having a cup of coffee
Amy started getting snarky oh no
it's the number one crime when you piss
off a homeowner she started she started
back talking me in my own domicile which
she was only paying utilities for
so I replied she needs to respect other
people's house and rules otherwise she
can leave she got upset and was quiet
the rest of the time but she did end up
leaving a few days early my husband said
Amy should have respected the rules but
I was too harsh on her I did text her
later but she didn't reply and she
didn't pick up my husband's calls either
he did talk to his half brother and they
were pissed off but I also told a couple
of my family members about it and they
think I'm fine am I an [ __ ]
an unbiased Observer said what the hell
are you talking about you crazy lady but
people who I have to see on a monthly
basis were like that seems fine to me
hmm I wonder
you're crazy you lost it
listen I could understand being annoyed
if your niece was staying with you and
then she like went on a date and brought
back a strange man to your house now
she's 22. so like you don't really get
to say anything but you might feel like
I'm not super comfortable having a
Stranger in My House overnight okay
you're allowed to feel uncomfortable
about it but like her husband coming
over and it's like
first off even if her husband like
stayed overnight in the same bed who
cares are you Robert De Niro from Meet
the Parents you know he's like the bad
guy if you've ever seen the movie like
there's not nobody is ever like wow
Robert De Niro and Meet the Parents Is
So based
there's if there's a sympathetic
character it would be Greg fonker's
fiancee
because even Greg focker does some
unconscionable things throughout the
movie but
it's her husband we I know we've talked
about this before this is not
necessarily like for legal reasons but
for practical social reasons married
couples are one entity when they choose
to be one entity
if you invite me somewhere and then I
show up with my wife you don't get to be
like oh we only saved you like one chair
one of you's gotta leave like that's
just
you're you're like you're not always
doing everything together a hundred
percent of the time but it's implicit
that you could bring them as a plus one
to almost anything I mean you can't buy
one ticket and then go you know bring
her to the movies but
you know for social Gatherings and stuff
like that absolutely
I might ask sure I might be I might be
hey is it well I don't
I don't if if like I was staying at a
family member's house and then like
Kate texted me and was like hey I
brought that report from home can I drop
it off I would be like yeah no problem
I'm not gonna go like ask for permission
I'm an adult I I would not insult you I
would not insult the host by asking
permission from to see my spouse
because if someone asked me I would be
like what the [ __ ] are you talking about
of course you can you can see your
spouse
this is in prison
just make sure they're gone by 11 A.M
the devil's hour
would you notify them
I don't think I would honestly I don't I
don't
because I don't I don't know because I
think I would be insulted if someone
notified me if I was at work and my
husband or my wife brought me some
coffee
I'm not going to send them a text that's
like just so you know if you look on the
ring camera and you see a lady that's
just my wife we're not doing anything
crazy
because that makes you look crazy but I
guess if the host is crazy you got to
know that in advance
[Laughter]
anyway
why are all these about toilets
thanks I hate sharing one roll of toilet
paper
two toilets side by side
you're the [ __ ] her husband is coming
over for a cup of coffee that is not
bringing men over sure your house your
rules but your reaction was completely
over the top as as was expecting her to
pay for the increase in utilities during
her two-week stay I mean I'll be honest
with you if she was taking three hour
long showers you might have like a a
cause if she's taking like normal shot I
would lose it I I would like we go visit
there listen okay it's there's a an
unspoken agreement okay
we go visit our In-laws in Washington a
lot you know like maybe once every two
months so and we usually stay overnight
for one or two days we eat their food we
shower in their bathroom we dry off
using their towels etc etc okay so they
are on a literal balance sheet level
they are paying for us to stay there so
what's the catch okay the catch is we
drove two and a half three hours to see
them we're gonna drive two and a half
three hours plus the Border back and we
bring um you know gifts for our nieces
and we bring them like a bottle of
scotch or a bottle of wine or something
like that or we pay for one of the
dinners there's there's it's the it's
what keeps the economy going is this we
don't need to have everything be be
broken down in ven mode you ate six
potatoes that's gonna I'm gonna invoice
you at 50 cents a potato you just you
know yeah they said they're not paying
for the gas you know we don't pay for
their use utilities and we just assume
that it all comes out in the wash
that's it's it's the favor economy
exactly
and utilities is crazy because it is
like it's I I get if you lived in you
know
Susan Marie in the middle of the Hydro
One blow up or something like that even
then you just gotta eat it but in a
normal circumstance like sincerely how
much is one person using in utilities
over the course of uh two weeks a shower
for her probably a shower once every two
days because I'm just implicitly
assuming she's one of those people
that's like actually showering is kind
of bad for you just so you know you
shouldn't shower often you should just
put nice flowers in your nose whenever I
walk by
uh several bucks exactly so we're
probably talking about low double digit
uh
dollars USD
if you're getting pressed over that
you're not you're not ready like I'm
just you're not you should just say no
you can't stay with me because that's
crazy
yeah shower listen I shower every day
but I I shower every day when I don't
work out but I also shower every day
because I work out
because I would be sweaty as hell I
would just be disgusting
but I still even when I'm not exercising
I shower every day just because when I
wake up I'm kind of disgusting too
I don't want to like it's not just about
like impressing other people I don't
want to smell my own self when I'm out
you know
what I do is take care of myself before
I put other people's oxygen mask on
if you want to be one of those people
who's like listen it's genuinely I
wouldn't have thought it if it weren't
for my wife but she literally can go
like three days four days not shower not
be gross not smell bad I'm like by the
end of the I probably should shower
before bed and when I wake up
it's just I I different hormonal
composition and different I don't know
bacteria in my armpits or whatever like
it's I I have the burden of having to
shower a little bit more often
that's really bad for your skin
I'm just chilling
never
in my life if I had a situation where
I've been like oh my skin is all [ __ ]
up I better stop showering
you take hot showers you know like Luke
hot
it's not lukewarm because that's cold
it's like Luke Luke
you know
you're the [ __ ] op and a looney
having family even if it's half
brother's daughters thanks for clearing
that up and the sarcasm tag sorry would
I lose this one on the screen
over for two weeks during exams and
paying utilities saying that she's
bringing men over when her husband came
by to drop off school work gtfoh get the
frick out of my house Dex with family
like this who needs enemies all bold the
user received Reddit this for this post
hold on scrolling scrolling this this so
much this period
you're the [ __ ] her husband isn't
bringing men over he was doing her a
favor to top it off you charge a family
member for utilities on a short stay hey
excuse me she's uh a half brother's
daughter
you're the [ __ ] I must admit I had to
read this twice how do you go from her
husband having a coffee after dropping
something off to Bringing men over
without running the risk of sounding
foolish okay anybody on her side just to
clarify you're married and he stayed
with you for two weeks paid some amount
for a utility increase and you got upset
when her husband stopped over I get it
is your house your rules okay everything
it might it's on repeat the record is
skipping
some of these I'm just not gonna touch
am I the [ __ ] for excluding my
parents throughpo party from my wedding
that's what I'm just gonna be I have the
shrewdness
to stay away from that one
just one one too many
issues that I don't want to get involved
with
I believe a throughpal is
a couple of three people
now the English language has about
15 words that describe a group of three
people we didn't need to be like we
didn't need to make a um a portmanteau
that being said I I can't deny that as
soon as I read it I understood what it
meant
why not call it a triumvirate does every
throughpal have a Pompey a Caesar and a
Crassus because I dude I don't think I
would want to be
I would have to get my ass out of there
if I if I looked and I was like
he's Caesar
and she's [ __ ] Pompey that means my
ass is Crassus I gotta I gotta form like
a new triumvirate man
I gotta I don't have to be Caesar but at
least gotta be poppy okay
if you are in a Drupal and you find
yourself being the if you look at the uh
if you look at the other couple in the
throughpal and you don't see a Crassus
guess what you the grasses
am I the [ __ ] for exposing my
co-workers bathroom habits
i-25f work at a smaller company of
around 15 people I get along with pretty
much everyone the exception of someone
will call Alexis
couldn't afford a car no okay let's not
go down this sorry I'll keep her again
Alexis is very socially conservative and
I am not I do my best to not talk about
something so I know will cause an
argument
but they sometimes happen anyway
one time I used the bathroom right after
the cleaning crew finished cleaning it
and didn't bother putting the toilet
seat down because I was just going to
squat to pee
it's common I'm not I'm not suggesting
this is not okay
I'm just wondering
I'm it's not how I pee right so like
wouldn't you rather sit down
or is it you don't sit down because of
the the grossness of the seat
let me tell you like here's what I'm
worried about I'm not worried about like
my my thighs being on fire from
squatting
I'm worried that like
if I sat down I'm confident in the
transit of the urine
but if I was squatting over the toilet I
would worry that I would augment the
angle of incidence and pee on my genes
men will tell you and I'm not sure if
this will happen if if this does happen
to women because I'm just not familiar
men will tell you we got enough problems
first off we've got distance from the
origin point to the Bowl but then on top
of that sometimes you'll just pee and
it'll be like
two streams for like five seconds
like it'll be like you have the
sprinkler on the wrong setting and it'll
go like
so and then it Narrows and starts going
into the starts going in the direction
you're pointing
sometimes you think it's it's going to
have like a laminar flow and it just
sort of dribbles out and you're like
what the hell dude
that's why I've become more of a sitter
honestly
because the the targeting computer just
gets it's a little bit messed up
it's just easier that way
plus you get to play a couple games of
slice and dice on your phone
honey are you okay you've been pissing
for 95 minutes
go away
go away go can't trip can't trip can't
trip roll can't trip can't trip Poison
Poison Can't trip
gather can't trip
anyway what time I use the bathroom
right after the cleaning crew finished
cleaning and it didn't bother putting
the toilet seat down because I was just
going to squat the pee I wash my hands
and when I exited I bumped straight into
a Lexus I apologized and went on with my
day for the next two weeks I thought
Alexis was being particularly
sanctimonious but I didn't say anything
as it wasn't too out of character the
subject of women's sports came up during
lunch and she made a snide comment along
the lines of people like op ruin them
for everyone else what the hell
all right well we're not going to touch
this one either um I'm gonna say you're
not the [ __ ] I didn't know
where that is not how I thought this was
gonna go holy cow
wait but then hold on she gets owned at
the end of the story let me just see how
um
just just give it a second give it a
second give it just give it one moment I
squatted Alexis the energy of the room
got very awkward so I decided to make a
joke are you telling me that you park
your bare ass on the toilet seat in
public restrooms she turned bright red
apparently she did because she started
muttering something about not being
weird before bursting into tears and
leaving the room at which point
Albert Einstein appeared
Serge what's the guy's name from the ABC
show what would you do
Regis Philbin appeared from behind a
curtain and said you were on Candid
Camera we were testing people's morality
and you
John Quinones why did I think his name
was Sergio Garcia
I know that that's a golfer it's a
Canadian golfer
am I the [ __ ] for letting my son get
fast food and bring it to a wedding
reception okay maybe
this one is like
well you know what no I was thinking
wedding ceremony
wedding ceremony not okay because it's
you're in the church and nobody else is
eaten
wedding reception
that's okay I mean it's like a little
weird but
like brother if I want to get McDonald's
I could just go get McDonald's
did you bring enough McDonald's for
everybody I don't understand
my son is a picky eater he's 22. okay
he's an adult look I'm not gonna go to
bed for the picky eater necessarily
I'm just saying
why I don't think it's it's weird but
the question is not is this weird
obviously everybody on the website is is
weird
am I the [ __ ] and it really depends
on what they said to the guy that
brought the McDonald's okay in my
opinion
my cousin was getting married and had a
lovely reception with a nice Buffet
Johnny wasn't a fan of what was served
so I let him leave and get some food
word spread amongst our family okay this
you couldn't find something to eat at
the buffet
that's what it's there it's it's got
everything even it doesn't have
everything it's got something
come on
it's it's a buffet it's not even like a
you know a la carte or something like
that
it's not a it's not a chef's just not an
Omakase
word spread amongst our family where he
was going and a few people asked him to
bring things back so he did okay now
that is listen
that doesn't make you the [ __ ] first
off your son is 22. the question should
really be is he the [ __ ] but then
also he should have realized you can't
bring stuff back for other people
because now you're undermining the day
one person can bring their own food
independent parties can bring their own
food without colluding with one another
but you can't run like a a gorilla rum
running operation the undercut the
caterer okay
we are at the table near a dance floor
and you could probably smell it there
but nobody in our immediate family had a
chance problem even the bride and groom
apparently the venue in the family of
the Bride were appalled and I don't
understand why it was a great party but
he wanted something different than other
people did too so am I the [ __ ] he's
22 years old and in college he has no
medical issues he just has a limited
palette
when I said let I meant I let him take
my car since we all rode together
further edit the food was buffet style a
nice soup salad tenderloin barbecue beef
pasta a few other selections it was
actually really good for wedding food
I info info what did he bring back
because if he brought back like a McRib
and they had barbecue beef beef
tenderloin
soup salad
pasta a few other selections it's a
lateral move
I need I I hope he came back with like
something crazy
it better at least have been another
country's cuisine
who's KFC oh no oh no I see now everyone
else who partook in the fast food did so
because it was there and tasted good
they didn't have a problem with the
venue's food also as some people said
one or two chicken bones did end up on
the floor in the venue that was
unfortunate oh come on man
you went like you didn't just go out and
get fast food you got like the messiest
fast food of all time and then left some
chicken bones on the floor
that's crazy
so I don't know first off I like KFC
but being like I'm I can't eat this
garbage I have to go get something like
KFC is insanity
your son does have a medical issue he
needs to be in the sanitarium with with
Renfield from Bram Stoker's Dracula
I would not take KFC over over this meal
for one but also I'm not a picky eater
but also if you are that picky of an
eater but there's something known as the
picky eater's curse okay and I know this
guy I got over picky eating when I was
like 17 but I still have many many
instances where you go somewhere and
you're like I can't eat anything so you
know what you do like if you want to
maintain
a copacetic environment where
everybody's happy you [ __ ] starve
and then like when you leave you go
through the drive-through and you eat
really quick like that's the that's the
secret or you yeah drink a bunch of milk
or something like that just
you're not gonna die you're just gonna
be like a little hungry and like then
you're not gonna be there all night
you're gonna leave at some point and
then you're gonna go get some food
it's not that big of a deal that being
said I mean I don't think I mean this is
maybe a technicality I don't think that
op is the [ __ ] I think his son is 22.
and I I didn't think that I was gonna
come into this and and take this side
of the of the the venue and the the
bride and groom because normally I'm
like you know people gotta be
comfortable however they have to be
comfortable but the sun made so many bad
choices like being a little bit of a
picky eater whatever being a lot of a
picky eater whatever going to get your
own meal
because you're you're hungry but you
can't eat the buffet food that's like
you're getting into the ESPN Red Zone
that's where we'd flip on the TV and
we're I gotta see how this goes down
because it's either going to be a big
stop or uh it's going to be a score okay
where you cross the line is when you
started bringing stuff back for other
people because now it's like you're
running like a a gray Market catering
service underneath the catering that the
bride and groom had already paid for and
then on top of that like you double down
on the Badness by getting the messiest
fast food essentially of all time like
food that is greasy and has a a strong
Aroma to it and also leaves bones
everywhere uh and then also leaving the
bones on the floor
so I I think that yeah I think the 22
year old is in is the [ __ ] here how
could they next time it happens well I
would love to say
take give yourself time and take a
decade and slowly expand your pallets so
that you I promise the water is fine on
the other side secondarily if that's no
longer an option because oftentimes it
isn't what you're going to do in this
situation next time is you're going to
go through a drive-through of a burger
joint and you're going to eat the food
in your car
and then if anyone asks when you come
back just say that you [ __ ] your pants
and you had to go home and change real
quick that's it
as long as you
you don't need to bring back a a bucket
of fried chicken into the party you just
go eat really quick and then and then
come back no one will question your
story if you say that you craft yourself
because that's already like as
embarrassing as it could be
he's cracked the code that's dude you
can use that for anything
hey Johnson why were you late today
sorry sir I got halfway to work in there
[ __ ] my pants I had to drive home and
change
well though Jesus
just take a sick day next time all right
go go to your desk
you can't use it every time well no you
just have to escalate
you could probably use it like three
times in a month but then after that you
got to start pretending to have like
ulcerative colitis which you should
probably should not do because it's
immoral for one but also it's gonna get
it's gonna make your life like Mighty
complicated
Johnson put down those potato skins you
know what makes your greasy food makes
your irritable bowel syndrome flare up
oh sir thank you what would I do without
you son of a [ __ ] could you just left
the house 10 minutes early that one day
do you see the Tweet today that was uh
George Costanza in the car with Uma
Thurman from Pulp Fiction
that was a heroin in my coat pocket it
was heroin no I never said the word
cocaine you thought cocaine and you
snorted the whole thing I never said
cocaine it was such a a great post
also that was the first time I actually
understood what happened in that scene
in Pulp Fiction I always thought she
just took too many drugs
but to be fair the first time I saw Pulp
Fiction I was
16.
and the second time I saw Pulp Fiction I
was like 18 and that was the last time I
saw Pulp Fiction which is a great movie
but I was like I've already seen it
twice I don't need to see it again
it's a great it's a great film
you're the [ __ ] for sure you should
have arranged something well he's not an

[ __ ]
he's not an [ __ ]
I don't know if I'm getting caught up in
the semantics or something here but
he's 22 like
okay it depends like is it 22 year old a
kid
well like in the sense that
I would trust them to pick their own
meal no they're an adult I would expect
them to be able to like
handle the situation like this and and
not [ __ ] it up that's a pretty small
amount of responsibility would I trust
them to you know like
run a company well only if it was like a
cryptocurrency exchange what's the worst
that could happen
I'm trying to run like a business with
like machinery and clients no of course
not they're 22. like they got a lot of
time left to get the experience required
to run like a legitimate business but
to run you know like the world's
second largest uh cryptocurrency
exchange sure maybe just that could be
like their first uh leg up on the
into the into the world of Private
Industry
you're the [ __ ] and mostly should
have slipped out Eden and returned
quietly letting it be known and eating
at the reception is a very [ __ ] move
true that's true
hardened you're the [ __ ] your son's
22 he can eat before the ceremony or
after or eat a granola bar in the
bathroom but instead you and him made a
big enough scene of the food not being
to his liking them many people knew and
then proceeded to bring back dinner for
a sec yeah okay it's all right don't get
me wrong I don't why do they always do
this on Reddit I don't know if people
realize that when you add like an own
like this it undermines the owning that
you did in the post anytime you add a
coda that is like it I assume the
wedding allowed children at the dinner
but it's unclear why you weren't sat at
the kids table and getting supervised by
the grown-ups you don't that is like the
you don't need to add that
you just need to break them down Point
by point
you know like you're spatchcocking a
chicken
and then people will be like holy cow
are that guy's knees up at his chin
because he just got sat down at the Kids
Table you let the audience add the coda
you don't add the coda yourself okay
you're the [ __ ] it's fast food it's
not a meal one lingers over for hours
it's a meal that one scarves down in a
couple minutes that's true but I don't
know maybe it shouldn't be
good post though it's a good post
am I the [ __ ] for not wanting my
ex-husband's new daughter to have a
complimentary Frozen name to the one our
daughter already has
Frozen name I mean it has to be Anna and
Elsa right like it's the only other
words Olaf and what's the reindeer
Sven
you know I watched a little bit of good
burger last night before the thumb
incident
you ever think that Kell from Good
Burger is really just the he's like
um Olaf for millennials
he he has a lot of lines that are a lot
like Olaf
Abe Vigoda craze it's it's insane that
Abe Vigoda is in that movie Abe vagoda
most famous of course for being in The
Godfather second most famous for falling
down in good burger and then saying can
you take me to the hospital I think I
broke my ass
what a what a film
so good
oh man
famous for being old yes they introduce
him you know what's crazy is they
introduce them and they say that's Otis
he's 77 years old he takes off an oxygen
mask and says
I should have died already or something
like that and you're like
he's only set like I don't know this
movie came out like 1998 or something
like that 77 is old but it's not that
old
it's not that I mean it's don't get me
wrong it's old it's not that old man
you know how I know it's not that old
because [ __ ] isn't Ava go to still
alive
the dude who said that in the movie is
still no okay he did die but he died
like a couple years ago
yeah in 2016.
he must have been like 95 or something
like that he lived for 20 years after he
filmed that movie
find me a 77 year old who isn't in
excruciating pain I I completely think I
could
I think I could well probably not like
right now because like there's a lot of
snow on the ground they're not going to
be outside because it's risky
but I bet if I just like walked into
um like a Shopper's Drug Mart and
probably statistically speaking the
third person I saw if I said excuse me
are you in excruciating pain they'd be
like no I got my aches and pains but I'm
chilling
that's my guess
I play Pickleball with a 75 year old
dude I'm still getting thrashed by uh
well actually I've kind of smoked a 50
year old guy on The Peloton today we
don't need to brag but like occasionally
a 60 60 year old man from Boca Raton
Florida thrashes me on the Peloton it's
very inspiring
my 31f ex-husband 35m got married less
than six months ago with his girlfriend
25f and she got pregnant very fast
recently he told me they were having a
girl
all of these details were not required
except for the the pregnancy part I
don't understand that to me
this stuff I'm supposed to
be upset with the husband implicitly
because he got married and had another
child too fast after the after the
divorce okay I understand but I'm not
because I don't know anything about him
I get that I'm supposed I get I know a
lot about you based on the way that you
wrote this sentence you you you tried to
Prime me
Shane Carruth you tried to Prime me into
disliking him
I'm going to be a more sober judge
I'm a huge fan of the movie Frozen which
is fine you can be a I know people are
going to be like Disney adult Disney
adult you could like a movie
you can bad chest it as well I think
both of those are within the spectrum of
normal behavior right now I'm not
offended by either so when our daughter
was born I wanted to name her Elsa my
husband agreed to that I know it's a
little dumb to name your kids after
things like that but it is not in a
super unusual or ugly name it is pretty
and it means a lot to me in the whole
scheme of
names after media this is not that bad
I wouldn't
do it but it's not that bad
it gives it is better than Khaleesi
exact is better than dovikin absolutely
probably a bunch of people in chat right
now are probably named Ness so don't
step to me I would never name my kid
Elsa okay
Super Mario Koopa Bullet Bill
Bowser [ __ ] you is what I'm trying to
say you peace you think you're better
than Elsa she's six have some respect
my husband and I divorced when our
daughter was three we don't hate each
other but we're not best friends either
we don't hate each other I just hate him
the issue with the new baby is that he
explained to me that after he told his
new wife the story behind the name of
Elsa she I would have thought that
honestly she probably could have pieced
that together herself but that's okay
I don't think she needed the
step-by-step process
um she proposed that their daughter
should be named Anna so they could be
sisters like in the movie for me it's
totally unfair they're stealing my
naming process from a movie that made
1.1 billion dollars at the box office
what if I have another daughter it would
have been perfect to name her Anna hey
guess what you still can
and now I wouldn't be able to do it
without looking like I'm stealing from
them you think you're the first
Anna out there in the world what about
uh Kendrick cornikova win tour
jealous Los Angeles you've never heard
of her
OverWatch yes
they are Moss exactly
Karenina there's dozens of them there's
dozens of them
of the Green Gables very true
my husband doesn't even like Frozen that
much he always said his favorite Disney
animated movie was bolt that's just
crazy
Bolt
I'm not saying it's like horrendous but
it's not even in the in the ballpark but
the classics
you take a bolt over like The Little
Mermaid
Beauty and the Beast Aladdin the
original Lion King Jungle Book
Snow White Cinderella 101 Dalmatians
come on
bolt with John Travolta as the dog or as
the dad I can't remember I only know it
because it comes up like early when you
go on Disney plus because it's in
alphabetical order
I don't know if the mother likes Frozen
but I'm totally sure she doesn't like it
as much as me I demanded to him that
they choose another name but he thinks
I'm acting crazy I call my divorce
lawyer but she doesn't think there's
anything we can do about this
my mother just laughed at me I feel so
defeated my sadness turning the anger
and in an Impulse of Rage I called my
ex-husband I told him that if they
insisted on using a name I would make
everything I could to sabotage the
relationship between our daughter and
theirs so they were never real sisters
like Elsa and Anna
you know what's crazy this is a lot like
the movie honestly
Anna and Elsa were very close Elsa you
know as a kid in in a bit of a a
juvenile impulse uses magic and
accidentally freezes uh
Anna's uh brain or something I can't
remember then they have to go to the
trolls and they you know thank God it
didn't get her in the heart because only
a true Act of love can thaw a frozen
heart but then it's really the problem
is that the parents keep Anna and Elsa
separated leading to them having a golf
just because they're trying to protect
both of them is really it's a cautionary
tale about you know being overly
cautious I suppose it's a cautionary
tale about caution it's not spoilers
this is all like this is the prologue
the Frozen
what are you talking about golf listen I
said golf
but also you can't be mad
I'm running on pure adrenaline right now
okay
also they cut ice
don't be still the Frozen Lord what a
song man
you know one of my favorite lines in
Frozen
is when everything gets covered in ice
everything gets Frozen
and then Anna's complaining and then
Kristoff says you think you got a bad I
saw ice for a living dude actually like
he put her in her place
I mean she had problems don't I'm not
saying she can't complain because her
sister did blanket the kingdom in snow
in the middle of summer time and froze
all the ships in the port when it seems
like their economy is based on trading
but at the same time like hey everyone's
got a hard life lady just chill out
it is it's a good line man
my daughter asked me like once a month
if they're making Frozen three
that's cute I don't know if they will
but it's cute either way I do like
frozen who asked that is funny
hopefully not you know you could just
not see it
you know Disney will will do what Disney
is going to do whether or not 24 year
old single men approve of their movies
that are targeted for like
eight-year-olds it's okay not everything
has to be for you you have almost
everything they're putting out like a
new Star Wars movie or TV show like
every 48 Hours okay
it's okay you can just ignore it
it'll be fine
I'm not 24. okay I'm not wearing
occupants
anyway I immediately regretted saying
all that messed up stuff and it is not
true I would never do that unless but
this whole situation has been so
horrible for me and now he's really
angry too which is okay when it's me but
when he's doing it not very nice I think
that I am ultimately in the right about
what they shouldn't why they shouldn't
use the name but I was wrong and saying
what I said I want to insist on them
picking another name without going too
far am I the [ __ ] well like listen I
think she's the [ __ ]
but I do also think that they should not
choose
that name it would be different if it
was like hey my grandma was named Anna
and it's just a coincidence
but for them to kind of like force a
relationship between the two kids
just because the first one is named Elsa
you know it's it's a little bit too much
I think it's definitely weird
I definitely also think that she crossed
the line
this is why you don't name your kid
Khaleesi and then you know be mad if
your husband
knocks up somebody else and they name
the kid called Drago okay just because
the name Anna and Elsa too they don't
have to be friends
you can have like a really close
relationship with your half sibling or
you could have no relationship with your
half sibling
I don't know I'm guessing you guys
probably live like two houses down from
each other so it seems like you're
probably going to be in each other's
life but
it's just weird you know like
they're literally sisters why are you
trying to Gaslight me into saying I'm
saying something wrong they may never
see each other again
we don't know
I'm not trying to say they shouldn't
they're like literally there's six and
like negative two months like
um all I'm saying is there's a lot of
variables here
I think they're both a little crazy
I think the husband has a type and the
type is crazy
also the fact that the
Mom is saying I think she likes Frozen
but she doesn't like Frozen as much as I
do is is the truly insane part for me
where I'm like
like aren't you in your 30s with a
six-year-old like don't you have other
things that are top of mind right now
it's true I forgot that his favorite
movie from Disney is Bolt so maybe his
opinion doesn't hold too much water here
this person might have been on the
cruise
it's possible
I don't know as long as you're staying
in a different room I don't really care
what I was people like this are the
reason that I didn't make an effort to
go to any of the the trivia days
it'd be like hey it's Marvel trivia
maybe you should go you could win a free
lanyard I walk by the Disney Lounge
they're reading out the the answers in
which uh Marvel movie does is wakanda
first mentioned my ass is like uh
Captain America Civil War and it's
[ __ ] in Iron Man 2
Black Widow says something like where'd
you get that Shield wakanda 99 of the
people that I saw in the lounge were
like yeah I got that I was like all
right I see I know my place
this is not my this is not my crowd
I I need who played Tony Stark in Iron
Man 2 and I'd be like easy Robert Downey
Jr
no problem
you're the [ __ ] take a cue from your
favorite movie and let it go okay that's
kind of funny
I'll give him that one you know why it's
funny because you got to commit to
either the own or the the breaking down
you can't do a breakdown and then an own
you got to choose whether you're going
to be like playing the light side or the
dark side a one-line own
I'll give you some credit for that
you're the [ __ ] did he ask for your
input on names for his daughter if not
I'm sure he didn't
then it's very inappropriate for you to
even comment let it go let it go see not
quite not quite the same level of
Panache but
I'm a huge okay sorry your naming
process is copying a top grossing
children's movie if you think you are at
all unique or special or that the names
Elsa and Anna didn't get a huge
worldwide bump after the film's release
you are deluding yourself
you are literally an evil stepmother in
a Disney film that's what you are right
now you are of course also an [ __ ]
okay listen there's there's no point in
reading these except to
get a little dopamine okay it's a Disney
adult she's gonna get torched by the
internet
and she deserves it a little bit but
it's that doesn't mean I
you know you know what bothers me I'll
see like a video of like somebody
falling down an escalator a little bit
and then trying to get up and then
falling down again and I'll be like that
was a little funny and people would be
like you're a horrible person then
people like sit there and jerk off to
like this kind of debauchery a fake
story that like oh I know so many people
like this okay no I don't actually but I
believe that they exist because I think
the worst of people and then I read that
you [ __ ] [ __ ] you piece of [ __ ]
[ __ ] your kids are never gonna speak
to you again once they turn 18 send a
boat a boat this this user received
Reddit rainbow for this post and then
you go out into the world and you're
like I'm a good person I'm a good person
I don't watch videos of people falling
down escalators and and chuckled at
myself a little bit well also hoping
that they're okay I don't hope that
they're injured
you do you think you're better than me
that's all I'm trying to say
am I in the [ __ ] for not cleaning up
our dog's pee quick enough honest
question I didn't know you could clean
up dog pee I thought you just kind of
let it ride
I guess if they peed on like a
like a tile floor or something
no I mean like outside not inside
dog poop you clean it up well I don't
know statistically speaking like 25 of
people clean it up I guess but like you
should clean it up
but P they just kind of let it ride
right you're not having them pee in like
a bottle or something like that
what does your house smell like we don't
have any dogs I piss in the toilet
unless I get the the Wizard split
I live with my boyfriend we have a dog
named
keto he's a Pomsky
he's they're like his Reincarnation of
Bernie Madoff it's a Pomeranian Husky
is it okay to ask who was on top
the sheer McCain how could you do that
I'm a secret agent Austin I did what I
had to do for the mission no I mean how
could you do it the Shia mechanics of it
are mind-boggling
that's from Felicity shagwell after uh
it's revealed that she had intercourse
with fat bastard to plant a tracking
device
uh in his rectum anyway
which I don't buy she shoves this thing
it's got to be like three inches long
and like it's I don't even know what I
was like the width of a D battery or
something like that she shoves it up
there and he goes ooh frisky are we like
I get that he has a prodigious size
I don't think that he would not notice
that being in there
I simply don't believe it
maybe thought it was a butt plug yeah
but what about like you know the next
day because because then he goes he
dumps it in the toilet in Paddington
Station
doesn't make any sense ding I don't
believe you can steal someone's Mojo
even if you do have a cordless drill
that's damn true
I've got your mojo now anyway
um we didn't get keto too long ago he's
about six months old now and we got him
when he was two months he's quite hard
to deal with I've been told by people
that we're not training him properly and
he's going to grow into a bad dog
there's no bad dogs by the way there's
merely bad owners I've heard I've never
owned a dog myself
the main problem though is he doesn't go
to the toilet outside I've tried
whatever I can think of but he just goes
wherever he wants inside the house to
pee and poop we watch him carefully and
try to prevent it as much as possible we
have training pads but he just ignores
them
there's a lot more stuff but obviously
there's a character Limit Oh is there is
there is there okay
recently my boyfriend mentioned he's Fed
Up of having to clean up dog mess all
the time and fed up of the smell of it
he's also complaining about taking him
on walks and other things luckily for
him he works Monday to Friday all day
what a line luckily for him he works
Monday to Friday all day so while he's
working I look after him that is so good
whoo
one day my boyfriend was at work I was
still in bed sleeping I always keep keto
in the room with me while sleeping and I
put a pad in the room in case he needs
to in case he needs the toilet but like
I said he just ignores it so he ends up
peeing right next to the radiator which
I which was on and well it smelled
really strong and it soaked into the
floorboards when I woke up when I woke
up I said to myself I'll clean it
evening comes my boyfriend returned us
so
when he goes into the bedroom he gags
and asks what the hell the smell is so I
tell him he was angry I didn't even
bother to clean it up and that I when I
did get up I still didn't clean it up he
was really upset he tried to clean it
but it was soaked in so the smell was
lingering and he would not stop talking
about it I said sorry but reminded him
okay this is bait it's bait
it's a bait post
you're the [ __ ] you're the [ __ ]
for writing this bait post okay
it is pretty funny
I you know what it means is I give more
credit to them for writing
luckily he's at work Monday to Friday
all day because now that I know that
that line is intentional I have to give
them some credit because it's one of the
funniest things I've I've read in a long
time I think
to resist the temptation to like
lead up to a bit like that like to
ascend to it and instead just drop it in
the midst of like a lore dump is
it takes some restraint
manly [ __ ] for requesting my wife
cleans up after herself here we go
i28m married my wife 23f who will call
Danny
and her her brother is caldrago or
viserys
about a year ago we were very lucky to
get pregnant soon after Danny's in her
third trimester now and on pregnancy
leave okay well
here's the thing
you're making a Reddit post uh
complaining about your pregnant wife
she got a she got a bowling ball in her
tummy right now she's got to be she's
gonna have to be living a very filthy
life for people to take her side okay or
for people to take your side I should
say
once we got the good news I started
working extra hours in order to save
more money for when the baby gets here
that means that I have to get up extra
early every morning to get to work you
shouldn't have wrote this part
because Chad's going to be like 6 a.m
that's crazy I get up at 3 45 a.m I'm
out the door at 4am bro can you imagine
whoa to be up at 6 a.m what is this a
Sunday so I'm just gonna do you a solid
there you should have left this out
I get home a little later and I'm
usually pretty beat but I still
contribute to the house by doing dishes
cleaning up after the cat because she
can't that's true
cat feline litter boxes carry a parasite
that can lead to birth defects you may
not know that I didn't know that in
advance of our pregnancy it's one of
those things you picked yeah
toxoplasmosis
that kind of stuff this new routine has
been hard on both of us we can buckle up
[ __ ]
this is
you're in the damn pre-show dude get
ready
I'm not saying it's easy I'm just saying
it ain't getting easier
well that's not okay it's definitely
it's about to get a lot harder
but then after like six months it'll get
a little bit easier
for a bit and then it'll get harder
again but like definitely you gotta take
a deep breath because the climb has
merely it's barely even begun honestly
so far everything's been fine that is
until the other day when I woke up to
Danny crying we only have one bathroom
which is downstairs and lately Danny has
been having a little bit more trouble
going up and down the stairs that's
usually fine for me but this time she
didn't make it so when I came downstairs
I found her in tears standing in her own
mess she was very clearly embarrassed
and even more so that I caught her I
immediately felt bad for her and tried
to comfort her and I told her it's all
good it can happen to everyone just
clean it up and we'll go back to bed she
asked me if I could help her clean it up
but I told her that it made me
uncomfortable I would never expect
anyone to clean up after my mess
oh okay that's see here's the I get that
you could say
it's different when you're changing a
baby's diaper because a baby doesn't
have the ability to change the diaper
themselves but your ass is going to be
like knuckle deep in urine and [ __ ] and
vomit and it's not just [ __ ] it's like
weird [ __ ]
even the normal shits are weird but like
the first few shits are crazy like
they're insane
um you are not if this is a real post
you are not ready for this plus like
I'm just I'm being completely sincere
100 percent
I'm not a pea guy
but like it's just p
it's not that crazy to clean up someone
else's pee
I'm not a bee guy I'm not
I'm not saying I would be like slurping
it up I'm just saying if she was like
can you help me I would be like I'd
already be getting the straw out of the
stuff I mean the towel I mean the towel
it's just like it's it's the p is not
that bad
like on maybe this is
I don't want to say controversial
there's like three
bodily functions you're likely to see on
the floor okay
in in a situation like this it's either
P or is poo or it's vomit
p is definitely
the least bad for sure
blood
I mean blood is also I would rather
clean up pee than blood for sure
what do you think I am a vampire
semen that's not even like whoop that's
nothing okay that's that's not even a
mess this is an oversight at most if
we're talking about the three most
common
you're gonna see p you're gonna see poop
you're gonna see vomit there's no
question I would rather clean up pee
than any of the other two now I'll be
honest with you I would rather not clean
up either of the other two but if I had
to to rank it I think I would rather
clean up poo than vomit
is my it would both are not great
it depends on the Pooh
but like vomit like scars you when you
clean it up like there's any especially
I think when it's not your own like
there's Foods I can't eat anymore
because like a roommate in college ate
them got too drunk threw up and then I
cleaned it up and then for like the rest
of my life I'm like okay I guess I'm not
having Swiss Rolls anymore
I think vomit is assuming it's like a
solid poop I would rather clean up the
solid poop than vomit
they're both definitely worse than pee
though
anyway because we got lost in the weeds
a little bit but can we at least agree
on that okay
hold on someone this is a definitive
Source I was an EMT for six years
vomit is the worst okay I I'm glad I
read it because you agreed with me I'll
take that
thank you thank you
where was I to be honest this has
happened before when I had a couple a
couple too many beers
but I always clean up after myself you
you routinely more than once you've
consumed enough alcohol to pee
on the floor
now I don't want you to think that
because I've cleaned up after my
roommates
in college that they never had to clean
up after me
because it was definitely a give and
take I've
been in heavily intoxicated I've I've
thrown up many times quite frankly
um
I've never gotten to the point where I
where I pissed on the floor
and I've been I've pushing it to the
damn limit in my younger days
I peed outside but that's like a given
that's like that's part of the the
upshot of being that intoxicated is is
you know letting it fly in the alley
beside the bar
but never inside like never on the floor
that's just crazy
but I always clean up after myself it
would feel weird to ask Danny to do it
for me in that situation yeah because
you did it to yourself [ __ ]
that's that's called Shame
you drank too much you peed on the
ground like a like a little baby
and then you're gonna talk to your wife
and be like I am I can't handle myself
can you clean up my urine that's because
you're it's [ __ ] embarrassing
obviously you wouldn't ask her to do
that she's pregnant
you guys are like 50 well you're not
even 50 50 but like you did 50 of the of
the easy work
now she's carrying the burden then
you're not even gonna clean up or piss
she's growing your child inside of her
uterus man
anyway
I she got really mad and called me
insensitive for making me clean up after
herself after an already embarrassing
enough situation I proposed a compromise
she would clean up the mess and I would
get her clean PJs that is uh
one of the one of History's great
greatest deal makers
which which implies originally
you were gonna let her get her own
pajamas
I think that the compromise had a
reasonable chance to backfire here
since I just done laundry anyway she
asked me if this was what it was going
to be like when the baby made a mess and
I told her I'd be perfectly okay to
clean up after the baby since it can't
clean up after itself I'm not saying I
called it I then told her I didn't have
time to stand there arguing with her all
night when I have to get up in like
three hours to go to work and provide
for us so I walked upstairs grabbed her
pjs for her and went back to bed
the next morning when I got downstairs I
found her on the couch
she told me she barely slept and felt
horrible about the night before she
called me an [ __ ] and said that by
not helping her I only embarrassed her
more she then told me she would be
staying with her mom until I got my [ __ ]
together it's been half a day now and
she's not responding to my texts I
talked about it with my co-workers
mixed responses but I just want to make
sure am I the [ __ ]
edit one so after about five hours most
of you all seem to agree that I am the
[ __ ] Danny's coming home tonight to
pick up some stuff so I hope we'll have
a moment to talk about it then I'll take
you guys's verdict into account going
into the conversation I did see some
people who would see my side of the
story so I do hope she'll take that into
account too
you just can't
you just can't accept it can you
sometimes you just gotta eat it man
like if you're 85 wrong
you don't need to be like yeah but I'm
15 right
you just got to take the bullet on that
one I'm sorry like it's I've been there
I've been 15 right you know what you say
I'm sorry I was wrong you know you don't
go hey I'm sorry but also could you give
me like a little credit
like that's
I'm sorry but also some redditors agree
with me like you just gotta like if it's
55 45 you could be like we're both wrong
and maybe you decide if you want to
fight for the you know the 50 50. but if
you're like this is like a 90-10 like
you don't need the 10 okay you need to
make up the Gulf of the 80 difference
there
he also told his co-workers that his
wife [ __ ] and piss all over herself
and the internet I guess
um I didn't really think about that but
that's that's true
so I have to okay sorry we'll update
soon um keeping it brief afterward limit
we'll post full update after judgment
long story short Danny and her mom came
to pick up things last night we talked
she told me her side I told her my side
in the end we both end up apologizing
and said we're gonna work it out she's
going to be staying with her mom until
we find a comfortable way for her to
sleep downstairs at my place
huh
what does she apologize for
she didn't do anything wrong
for pissing herself yeah she's pregnant
it's [ __ ] up it's a Little Shop of
Horrors
yeah throwing up for no reason thinking
like good good smells smell bad like
your brain is like a it's a fun house
mirror you don't have to apologize for
that
for not getting their own PJs
it's crazy yeah you're the [ __ ] look
at his username
she's pissed
maybe he's not the [ __ ] now that I
think about it
because that's pretty funny
um
honestly dude you're the [ __ ] man up
and help the woman out who's carrying
your child you pissing yourself when
you're drunk is not even remotely
related to your pregnant wife struggling
to move fast enough to get where she
needs to go if it happens again help her
out for now I just apologize and
acknowledge her feelings
man
I remember this one time my husband and
I were dating and didn't live together I
got food poisoning woke up vomiting I
called him frantic as I was being sick
everywhere couldn't stop him was scared
he drove over in the middle of the night
cleaned up my bed while I cleaned myself
packaged me and a toddler up and bundled
this up and brought us to his parents
house so I wouldn't be sick alone FYI op
my husband has a squeamish stomach and
is ill at the sight sound and thought of
others being sick he's still totally
cleaned up after me alone when it was in
his house when I wasn't his wife when I
wasn't pregnant just because he loved me
and I needed help explain your excuse to
me again Hey listen lady he had to be up
in the morning to go to work okay
info what was your husband what your
boyfriend what was your husband what was
your boyfriend doing in the morning okay
is your boyfriend going into work in the
morning would he have to be in the
office at 8 30.
defeating that you listen he had a very
important meeting that day to provide
for the family
I can't miss my daily stand-up or Kurt
will be he'll throw a [ __ ] fit in the
slack man
he might work a real job like unlike
software development or streaming okay
if I'm going down I'm taking
15 of you [ __ ] with me
hold up you told your co-workers about
your wife soiling yourself OMFG and the
fact that a woman in her third trimester
would have a terrible time kneeling and
getting back up off of the floor omff FG
you're the [ __ ]
oh man
you're the [ __ ] she's in her third
trimester you should have helped you
also need to figure something out so she
doesn't have to go up and down the
stairs in the middle of the night but
maybe she figured that out by herself by
moving to her mother's
I don't know it goes against the grain
of the comments here already but my
judgment him reading this comment
finally it goes against the grain of the
other comments here but I'm gonna have
to say that you're the [ __ ]
just because she's capable of cleaning
up after herself doesn't mean she has to
and that you couldn't have helped now
I've never been in this situation but
there's been plenty of times where my
partner and I will clean up each other's
vomit in situations because we have
empathy and feel bad for each other yes
we could make them do it themselves
because they got two feet in a heartbeat
but there's a sense of love and
compassion here yep
yep okay fair
your wife who was seven months pregnant
okay listen Maybe learn some empathy
please tell me this isn't like a you it
is a YouTube video oh no
you're the [ __ ] please do not compare
pissing yourself while wasted drunk
they're having an accident when you're
you're in your third trimester and
there's a human pressing down on your
bladder and pelvic floor
[Laughter]
sure that's true
oh man let's slash marker this



excuse me what the heck is a Telus Spark
if I was gonna make fun of a car I would
make fun of the Chevy Spark
Telus is it you know a part of the
Canadian telecommunications oligopoly
not part of the American automaker
oligopoly all right there's two that
there's a lot of oligopolies and some of
you are getting it twisted okay
by the way the rumors of react towards
death are greatly exaggerated am I the
you know what because I do not want to
swear early in the YouTube video
aita for telling my parents that they
ruined New Year's celebration after they
kicked my husband out over a joke okay
can I but before we even get started on
this one can I tell you something
New Year's
not one of my favorite holidays I this
year hey let me put it this way I a
better way to describe it I think New
Year's is predominantly a holiday for
younger people which is fine
I think if you're between the ages of
15 and like
how old am I 34 let's say 33 then that
that's your New Year's window I'm
officially past my New Year's window I
did not even
consider staying up to to 12 this year
for New Year's I sell it and you know
what I'm realizing now I didn't even
talk about it we're like a weekend of
the new year now I celebrated New Year's
at 9 00 pm
I'm on the west coast I celebrated when
the East Coast ball dropped and only now
am I realizing that I didn't even put
like an asterisk
I was like that's New Year's
I'm now forcing myself to look at myself
in the mirror and being like no that was
9 p.m I started my new year like three
hours earlier anyway
it's just listen I'm not being a hater
it's just one of those like uh
it's like for most people New Year's is
like it's a holiday where you just have
an excuse to like get hammered
come on like don't lie
not that many people my age are staying
up to
midnight on like a random day unless
they got at least a couple of flutes of
champagne in them it's basically like a
it's a quarter one St Patrick's Day
anyway regardless I should move on here
I've been married to my second husband
Mike for four years now he's a jokester
and loves to crack jokes all the time
this post is written by Mike and uh
you know what from now on let's just
call him open mic
he especially likes to joke with my
brother Ethan and his wife Ethan used to
be okay with it till he started
complaining about Mike taking it too far
with his jokes some context about Ethan
he and his wife couldn't have kids so
they adopted a boy Joey two years ago
Mike has been making silly lighthearted
jokes that involve Joey's bio parents as
a way to mess with Ethan and his wife
okay Mike is uh he's a social terrorist
that is over the line you got to read
the room
I already talked to Mike and I he 100
means no harm the joke is that what if
he meant harm though the joke is like
you know I'm a good guy so I can joke
about stuff that's like not acceptable
because I'm just joking
so fast forward to New Year's Eve my
parents hosted a big celebratory dinner
and Ethan and his wife came while we
were eating dinner Mike decided to tell
a knock knock joke to Ethan knock knock
who's there Mike replied Joey's bio
parents then he bursted out laughing
that's the joke there's not even a punch
line the joke is just that your child's
adopted
and that's humorous for some reason
don't type I can't as if the it's
as if there's some humor in there
an argument ensued
and dinner was paused my parents told
Mike to leave which I thought was too
harsh I tried to speak to them and give
them to calm down my mom insisted that
Michael Eve we left and Mike was
complaining the whole time about how
they overreacted what they just kicked
you out of dinner is a joke oh all of a
sudden you can't take a joke I see how
it is
when you say something offensive you
want everybody to just relax when they
say something offensive your feelings
get hurt
I called Mom later she told me Mike was
out of line with this hurtful jokes
about this touchy subject and I was
wrong for defending him she said he
ruined New Years for the family but I
told her it was her and dad who ruined
New Year's celebration for escalating
the situation and kicking him out I told
her he could talk to them but again they
were the ones who ruined New Year's she
called me delusional for this statement
and hung up we haven't talked to them
for days I tried contacting Ethan but no
response this is the it's a gimme
is listen
you would still probably be the [ __ ]
if the joke was funny but there's no
joke
it's probably fake don't get me wrong
it's I was it's either fake or it's
written by Mike let's put it that way
but like there's no joke
knock knock who's there your kids birth
parents that's just like
it's just really hurtful
for no like it's not the the statement
itself is not even that hurtful it's the
fact that that he thinks it's funny
thus implying like there's something to
be ashamed of that you adopted a kid
that makes it like 10 times more
offensive
she is married to Eric Cartman you're
not wrong like the joke doesn't make
sense
if it made sense I might be inclined to
at least be because then we talk about
it in react court all the time sometimes
you're like you know
like a very common react chord situation
is hello Invicta by the way hello a very
common react Court situation is like
somebody was something that they might
consider a flaw is overly critical of
someone else and then you get that
little demon in your head that's like
say like hey maybe you should lose 30
pounds before you judge other people and
there's a I think you can at least
acknowledge like that there's some
respect
you know some some relatability at least
this one is just not even humorous it's
basically just like I'm I'm a jerk
so I'm gonna give that a no
I'm gonna give that a you're the ass
there's nothing more to touch upon here
I mean this is the easiest am I the
[ __ ] of all time
am I the [ __ ] I I'm gonna miss once
we're out of like the one month window
where Christmas had just happened
because uh
I love the ones where adults
and this is a little touchy okay
I love the ones where adults act like
Christmas is like you no matter what
happens everybody has to get together
for Christmas
like even if my dad is a war criminal
who shot my fiancee in the leg hey let's
put everything aside for Christmas we'll
deal with this in uh January
because like the holidays see like
people have different expectations for I
mean like some people are crazy and they
want their in-laws to like respect them
and uh some people are like no no matter
how disrespected I get you I'm you can't
skip the turkey you can't skip or what
do you eat in the U.S you can't skip the
ham
am I the [ __ ] for skipping Christmas
with my parents since they won't treat
me like an adult everyone sucks
according to the the Flair here
who knew
I have been with my boyfriend for almost
two years now he we will be getting
married eventually but it's not a
priority
my mom won't let us share a bed if we
come see them for any reason when we
came over this last summer my boyfriend
suggested renting a hotel so we could
have privacy in a comfortable bed it
drove my mom nuts that we bypassed her
little rules it's not bypassing the
little rules
in in the slightest
if you can't sleep in the same bed
together in her house sleeping in the
same bed together outside of her house
is not
is not bypassing the rules
also she's she's 27 years old
like 50 years ago she would have had six
kids by now
you just at least let him sleep in the
same bed they're adults
she wouldn't drop it the entire time we
were there she made me promise not to do
it again
not to do what again
I don't understand what you're talking
about
are they doing it all the time they're
27 and 33 they've been dating for two
years maybe they live together like I'm
sure they sleep in the same bed do you
have to like tell your mom every single
time or something you make him sleep on
a futon I don't understand
my boyfriend's mom and dad are retired
to Mexico and they're really chill so we
made plans to come visit them over
Christmas they are not Christians so
they don't really care when they see
their son with regards to religious
holidays we didn't tell my parents we
weren't coming my mom asked at
Thanksgiving if I was going to hold them
I promise not to stay at a hotel over
Christmas I answered truthfully that I
would not stay in a hotel
I'm sitting here on the balcony of my
future in-laws condo looking at the
Caribbean waiting for Sunrise and
enjoying the peace and quiet I made the
mistake of going online yesterday and
saw a bunch of posts from my mom and my
sisters about how I was a jerk for lying
to them about my plans okay well like
you are a jerk also
like no disrespect but your mom asked if
you were gonna stay in a hotel there's
an implied like you're visiting for
Christmas question there
it's a Lie by omission
didn't we do this one no no no no no no
it's just I'm telling you there's a lot
of
there's a lot of sacred Christmas ones
I mean I just don't like if your mom is
a
your mom can be a little bit crazy but
she's still your mom if she's like super
crazy well that's a different story okay
you might have to like sever or limit
your relationship but
if she just doesn't want you to sleep in
the same bed you say sorry Mom I'm 27
years old I'm going to sleep in the same
bed as like my what right now I feel
like is going to be in my future spouse
also I'm not coming to Christmas we're
spending Christmas at his parents place
this year I don't know why you would
just like
Blindside them on Christmas unless this
is a fake post which is always possible
or alternatively you like why do so many
people feel the compulsion in these
posts to own ER families
like this is not how normal people act
they'd like if they're not coming to
Christmas they'll be like sorry I'm not
coming to Christmas this year and then
you could take it from there they don't
go like no don't worry I'll stay
someplace else you don't need to save me
a room and then like on December 25th
when they call you and are like where
are you you're like I'm in uh you know
Puerto Vallarta right now it doesn't
make any sense
just talk
or at least text I don't understand
I may have been a little tipsy last
night because I decided to respond I
said it was ridiculous of them to try
and tell me I couldn't share a room with
my boyfriend they didn't say you can't
share a room they said you can't share a
bed
I'm I'm already on your side you don't
have to misrepresent the situation to to
amplify it okay
it's the sharing not being able to share
a bed is already unacceptable you don't
need to to go out here and lie
I was keeping my promise by not staying
at a hotel when we were there and that
if they planned on putting everything on
Facebook I would be avoiding all visits
for the foreseeable future they took
down their posts when people started
cramping on them for trying to control
me but some people did agree with them
now they are texting me and calling to
say I was an [ __ ] for making them
look bad I asked them if they're trying
to make me look good with their posts
they stopped for a while but there were
more texts and voicemails this morning
I'm kind of liking the idea of skipping
out on the drama from now on but I miss
my dad and he's blameless in this am I
the [ __ ] yeah like well yeah
maybe the question the subreddit is not
called like who is the biggest [ __ ]
the subreddit is called am I the [ __ ]
and and there's an implied possibility
of plurality there
definitely all the [ __ ] in this
situation except for the dad who's
apparently blameless
but like
I just don't it just seems so
sorry let's read the edit first
I'm having trouble wrapping my head
around there listen lady if you if you
have an opinion on this Earth and you
post it on the internet you're gonna get
people who disagree with you you're
getting take it from the master of
getting one guide you're getting one
guide right now most people are gonna be
like somewhere on this spectrum of like
what you did was acceptable but you're a
little in the wrong or you're a little
in the right some people are going to be
like her house her rules don't worry
about those idiots okay they're on their
knees for their landlord right now they
love it okay you don't need to worry you
don't need to base your whole edit
around like insane bad faith questions
okay
I'm having trouble wrapping my head
around a couple of things that keep
being repeated no you're not no you're
not you're taking the stupidest comments
that replied to you and then
spotlighting them to strengthen your
case I know because I do it it feels
great
how was staying at a hotel so we didn't
break her rules not the adult choice no
it is the well no listen it here's why
it's not the adult Choice it's again a
false dilemma the adult choice is
telling your mom you're 27 years old and
if she doesn't want you and your
boyfriend sleeping in the same bed then
you go stay in the hotel you got it the
adult choices at least standing up for
yourself a little bit not being like 16
years old and and being like I found a
loophole because it's not a loophole
it's just a it's just a a normal course
of action
hey crusty jugglers thanks for the
gifted subscriptions by the way thank
you
how many of you guys fly across the
country or drive for hours to just stay
one night well like fly across the
country for one night no probably not
drive for hours to stay one night it
depends how many hours I guess but then
the question is like who asked I don't
understand what
I guess people are probably insinuating
to her you couldn't have just spent one
day at their house for Christmas
that which
I don't know I mean she did fly to
Mexico but she didn't she didn't stay
for one night didn't you see as their
idyllic uh condo overlooking the the
Caribbean
I would drive four hours to stay one
night
we do not for for Christmas we stayed
two nights yeah but like we random
weekends will drive down like three
hours plus the U.S border crossing
you know eat lunch eat dinner go to
sleep wake up eat lunch drive home
it's just and honestly I I the the drive
gives you a chance to to sort your uh
your thoughts
deal with some latent Trauma from like
the mid-2000s
how long is that drive I don't know well
when when it was snowy it was like you
know six hours
when it when the weather's nice and not
that many people are on the road it's
like two and a half
not to mention there was one time we
drove to Washington like literally drove
like an hour to the Border crossed the
border drove like another hour just to
eat dinner with them at the the Silver
Reef Casino and Spa
ate some middling prime rib drove back
across the border
an hour and then another hour home and
went to sleep I remember that
it was not even a big name Casino excuse
me
you don't like the the Silver Reef
Casino and Spa
please watch the over clip the OverWatch
clip can I tell you as well this is a
true story when I was driving yesterday
I was behind a car first off people in
BC will know it had two new driver
sticker stickers on it which is just
weird like it's like a like they're
sarcastically putting them on because
you only if you're a new driver you
legally only have to have one
they had two for some reason it doesn't
mean they're a super new driver
they had a bumper sticker that said
Boobies Make Me Smile and then the two
o's in boobies were like a stylized 3D
you can probably figure it out it had
the nipples and the areolas and
everything and there were a lot of other
bumper stickers on the back of the car
but the one that threw me for a loop was
they just had one that was the stock
OverWatch logo
yeah
yes
okay
baby shark you know like Coco melon
stuff yeah
okay here we go what what what does
Spotify choose to play after Coco melon
baby shark and then other Coco melon
songs you'll never guess
what
and I was like um this does not sound
right so I just skipped it but I don't
even know that's a that's a thought KKK
Took My Baby apparently it's by The
Ramones yeah I don't know why that would
show up after after baby shark though I
was
there is also I've noticed whenever I
have it played Coco melon baby shark
every song that it plays after that is
in Spanish
I
don't know like there's nothing wrong
with it but like they play baby shark in
English and then they go straight into
like Spanish Happy Birthday songs yeah
yeah apparently it's a banger but I
don't think it should be in a loop it's
probably not yeah well you know
Steve it's the hour the algorithm makes
no mistakes
it's just the title no it's the Ramones
so it's for
teenagers
oh no I mean the remote I got nothing
against the Ramones but just trying to
insult them I guess just trying to just
trying to generate a little
entertainment on the Stream
plus two plus two they love it anyway
where were we long story short also
while I was driving I didn't even
mention this I got the finger for no
reason
I like literally for doing a nice thing
I'm sure you have them everywhere but we
have like
so it's like two lanes going this way
two lanes coming the other way
and then there's not a stop sign or an
intersection but they have little like
the the median is uh recessed so cars
could like turn from one lane to cross
onto like a residential side street so
there's no intersection
long story short I saw a car waiting to
pass through the median and go to a
residential side street there was no one
behind me which is very rare in this
city so I slowed down with i telegraphed
that I was slowing down and then this
car drove across and then he looked at
me as he was going across and just held
up the the middle finger and I have to
this day which was it's literally one
day since it happened I have no idea why
laughs
foreign
there's nobody behind you don't stop
it's not worth giving someone the finger
it's just a nice thing to do
just extend a little common courtesy you
know
I give up my right of way from time to
time
like if if I'm at a stop light like
let's say we're in a long chain of cars
at a red light and someone's trying to
exit
uh
like a a store or a mall
I'll keep my brakes on an extra five six
seconds to to let him out of the
the shop parking lot that's no problem
that's different
well I guess I from now on I'm just
sorry you you reap what you [ __ ] saw
from now on I'm just gonna I'm gonna cut
them off and then I'm gonna give them
the damn finger
[ __ ] you for trying to exit Shoppers
Drug Mart at this exact moment [ __ ]
if you wanted to exit the parking lot
you should have thought of that before
you went into the parking lot
sewing yeah it's yeah it's reaping no no
what the hell anyway no this person is
listen
part of
I think it's just life okay
you need it and I think people learned
this lesson at different ages if they
ever learn it at all your existence is
going to inconvenience other people full
stop everything you do is going to uh
cause a distraction or a mess or just
otherwise and like what you have to do
is minimize within reason the annoyance
that you create while also recognizing
that it's a Humanity's cross to bear to
be annoying
so when you get a little bit annoyed by
other people you also have to
acknowledge that you are doing that at
the same level of annoyance yourself
so what I'm trying to say here is we all
have to get along so your mom's a little
bit crazy she doesn't want you sleeping
in the same bed as your future husband
okay reminds me of a little story Meet
the Parents perhaps you've heard of it
Robert De Niro does not want Ben Stiller
sleeping in the same bed as his daughter
until they get married did they say
screw you jack I'm going to
um like well in the second movie they do
go Meet the Fockers to be fair but it's
they don't present it as if it's the
right solution or the problem the
solution is you you exactly you
compromise you coexist you have a
you try to make it work so but some
people and I you probably have noticed
it in your own life some people are
drama dampeners
[ __ ] me oh okay I guess that's fair uh
see you at Easter and some people are
drama amplifiers [ __ ] me [ __ ] you
[ __ ] you I'm gonna no green beans I'm
not coming here ever again you know so
you need
feel like in any sort of dynamic like
this you need some you need at least a
dampener and if you just get two
amplifiers they end up in this like
unstable orbit where they're both going
to shoot off in outer space so yeah I
always say it's in everybody sucks here
your mom had an unreasonable request
with that unreasonable request was
probably not worth you know essentially
owning her by letting her belabor under
the false pretense that you were going
to be at the holidays and then being
like psych and then when they were like
why aren't you here they're like because
you won't let me stay in the same bed as
my then you should bring that up before
so that they know either way like I'm
saying the mom is wrong too I'm just
saying it's less obvious in my opinion
that that she's also wrong or at least
could have been more right
let's put it that way
this is gives good comments on this one
at least
I'm sure everybody sucks here your mom
is horribly controlling that's not a
question but instead of saying I won't
be spending Christmas with you this year
I'm going pardon me to the in-laws and
if I if I come to you again we will stay
in a hotel you lied in such a way that
they thought you'd be attending instead
of acting the in the adult manner in
which you want to be treated you behaved
like a child true
edit well now this kicked off thank you
for the awards it does have 35 000 likes
clearly a mixed bag of responses just a
little clarification alive Omission is
still alive if you're dealing with a
narcissist it is all the more important
to stake your boundary clearly and stick
to it otherwise you will leave yourself
open to their abusive tactics and flying
monkeys
I don't know if I'm online enough
for uh
for to understand what that is
it might be a thing for all I know
anyway and for everyone that told me to
f off or similar Merry Christmas to you
too the best revenge is living well she
won't be in a hotel next year either
she'll be at the parents house sleeping
in the same bed as the boyfriend because
she fought correctly and defeated her
family this year not the [ __ ] okay
you're you're a crazy person
you're insane life must be very
stressful when you consider every
interaction a battle
flying monkeys are people who side with
a narcissist you know what I was
dismissive of the of the phrasing at
first but it actually makes perfect
sense
what an apt metaphor fair enough
otherwise outside of my area of
expertise but I get it now
witches is there a reason you didn't
tell them up front that you would be
spending Christmas with your boyfriend's
family they're [ __ ] for trying to
control you but I don't really see what
you gain by misleading them to avoid
weeks of my mom trying to manipulate me
into going home
how did that work out for you
it's like I could have dealt with it in
advance instead I
basically saw like a train wreck coming
and decided you know rather than turn on
the warning lights and hit the brakes
speed up
like I'm not saying your parents can't
manipulate you when you're like
an adult I don't think that's fair but
like
I don't know just the forehead like
don't get manipulated I don't know I'm
sorry it's not fair at all it's very
dismissive
but like if your mom was like you can't
sleep in the same bed as your boyfriend
and that's like a deal breaker why don't
you just say okay I'm not coming to the
Christmas then I don't understand
because this is what you did anyway is
you just didn't go to Christmas but then
you like
you just kind of Blindsided them with it
which I don't know I don't know your
parents so maybe
hey it's a the brain is complicated
that's true that's a good point
I still think she could have handled it
better let's put it that way
This falls under if all I have to do to
make you look like an [ __ ] is tell
the truth
that means you're acting like an [ __ ]
that comment is very well phrased and
allies so many posts in this sub so
me when my reaction is this
okay I don't know it seems like a lot of
reasonable people in the comments I was
surprised that we we scrolled like four
comments down we did not see a single
her house her rules
am I the ass this dude there's so many
Christmas ones
it's crazy
oh we already read this one am I the
[ __ ] for taking an Uber to the
wedding
am I the [ __ ] for losing it and
telling my in-laws to stop calling me
mama
am I the [ __ ] for leaving my in-laws
Christmas dinner after I found out they
didn't make accommodations for me uh
Dieter post
I got invited to my fiance's family's
Christmas dinner it's my first Christmas
with them I have always been picky about
what I eat can't help it okay okay I'm
taking you at face value there has to do
with psychological factors childhood and
personal likes and dislikes before
accepting their invite I let my future
mother-in-law
you ever notice how future mother-in-law
acronym is just MILF but in Pig Latin
oh sorry I can't come to the phone right
now I'm watching
families on LCT
I don't know why you would pick up the
phone to tell someone you're watching a
TV show but
I wanted a loop MILF Manor in there
somehow hey Rex mechanica thanks for the
gifted subscriptions thank you
thank you
one uh this is not fair it's a it's a
mean-spirited joke one
gifted subscription for every dish at
Thanksgiving that this person would not
eat sorry Christmas every dish at
Christmas this person would not eat
I ex before I accepted the invite I let
my future mother-in-law know I wouldn't
be eating any traditional food at the
celebration and showed her a variety of
dishes to choose from to accommodate me
listen
okay
I am making my own head Cannon here
but did you really go to your future
mother-in-law and like show her a
picture of French fries chicken nuggets
cheese pizza hot dogs
[Laughter]
and just picture your future
mother-in-law being like yes I'm
familiar I'm familiar with macaroni and
cheese I'm familiar with
with fish and chips I'm familiar with
all of it I promise you maybe that's not
the case okay but but that's the way to
I'm familiar with with bread but not
whole wheat bread because that's weird
like
mm-hmm
she refused and told me to bring my own
dish which is very reasonable by the way
that's not crazy like as a picky eater
if you're if she's like yeah come to
Christmas but bring something that you
want to eat that doesn't make her in the
wrong at all that the way you phrased it
makes it sound like she's rude but
actually that's that's completely
accommodating
I said if I had to bring my own dish
when I'm a guest then I better stay at
home then we went back and forth and I
insisted you don't know how to use a
toaster oven just go ahead and say it
it's you've had a technical debt there
for a long time and you you know you're
too busy to fix it now I understand
you don't need to make it seem like
she's being unreasonable though like
she's railroading you you could just you
should just say listen
if you're like
an adult and you tell some like your
future mother-in-law that you don't know
how to cook she'll help you
if you said I don't know how to cook at
all I don't even know how to use a
toaster she would take you into the
kitchen and she would give you a basic
lesson at the very least she would be
like here's how to use the toaster oven
here's how to use the air fryer
instead you let your own ego get in the
way I'm like there's a lot of head
Cannon for me in this one but it's
instead you let your own ego get in the
way and now you're fighting with your
future mother-in-law
for what
you can't make your own chicken nuggets
okay anyway we went back and forth I
insisted I wouldn't come if
accommodations weren't being made I just
thought it was a simple request and
future mother-in-law could have agreed
if she really wanted me there
what kind of this can't be real right I
hope not no adult is like if my future
mother-in-law really wanted me to be
there she would cook chicken nuggets
just for me
my fiance agreed I should bring my own
dish but I didn't when we arrived there
and I saw that no accommodations were
made I got up got my things and walked
out and went home my future
mother-in-law and fiance were shocked
that an adult that seemed otherwise
reasonable would throw a temper tantrum
like a little kid I got tons of calls
and texts from them both and my fiance
came home lashing out calling me selfish
and spoiled to walk out like that over a
dish that his mom didn't have to make
for me and that it was my responsibility
to feed myself how was it my
responsibility to feed myself when I'm a
guest I'm a guest didn't you read the
guest handbook
the guest handbook says the the whatever
the guest wants the guest gets
makes no sense to me I told him this he
accused me of starting and ruining my
first Christmas with his family and
disrespecting his mom
now he's continually saying I fricked up
and should have sucked it up for the
family's sake edit to clear a few points
a lot of people eating my ass in the
quote retweets right now aren't familiar
with the specifics of the case that make
it appear more reasonable for me because
I didn't write them in the first place
for those saying I have no respect for
my in-laws I do
especially my future mother-in-law I
respect her but this is so far the
biggest conflict we've had
in theory I respect her by way of my
actions I could see how you would be
confused but
I work long hours even on holidays so
not much time to cook
you
we actually and I hate to say this there
is info required here does she only eat
like
masala dosa or something like that that
you know a 16-hour preparation
is is there does she only reverse seared
uh sous vide
beef tenderloin like
because if you if you were at the
Christmas then you have enough time to
cook something like you could eat
anything
maybe it's not chicken nuggets but even
like you could Rachel Ray 30 minutes or
less you know you could
I refuse to believe this [ __ ] because if
you don't have the time on Christmas how
do you have time at all you don't you
did because you're lying a little bit or
you could you just gone through a
drive-through on the way or something
like
I wasn't asking for an elaborate dish or
several dishes just one simple option I
wasn't asking for anything complicated
that would have taken a long time to
cook that being said I don't have time
to cook it okay because I'm busy unlike
her unlike her I don't see what she's
doing all the time so she's probably
just watching TV
you're the [ __ ] from one picky eater
to another
I went to a Christmas dinner with my
mom's family there was nothing I wanted
so I just socialized and ate when I got
home why should she have to make a whole
new dish for you this is pretty entitled
Behavior sanest Uh picky eater
this is what I was like when I was a
picky eater too like if anything listen
I don't want to make you
more self-conscious than you might
already be because I was in your shoes
not but 17 years ago
you're already making people like a
little uncomfortable by breaking the
social Convention of eating shared food
at a special occasion okay but if they
are like if they're not forcing you to
eat which is another annoying part of
being a picky eater when you're like I
don't want anything I'm not hungry and
they're like no you absolutely have to
eat something that's annoying as well
I'm just saying you could as long as
everybody's you know just being
copacetic there's no problem
but you can at least eat like the mashed
potatoes or something
but then I'm also like like they should
you should have brought your own food at
least like I if I was but that's a whole
nother am I the [ __ ] because like
there's always an am I the [ __ ]
that's like am I the [ __ ] for being
mad that my nephew brought McDonald's to
Christmas dinner and I'm always like nah
man why not I would rather eat the
Thanksgiving feast City McDonald's I
could eat McDonald's any day of the damn
week
anyway
just a whole ball of Wax
let me recap you demanded some food was
made to your liking when people told you
no instead of cooking food you caused a
scene yeah you're the [ __ ] start
acting like an adult
how many variations of this story do you
plan to post before the holiday you
posted after being told they weren't
going to make a different meal and how
you thought it was nuts everyone told
you to bring your own food and now you
didn't and made a scene you're the
[ __ ]
dude that's so funny
imagine so that makes me think this is
more real now imagine making a post
that's like hey my fiance and her mother
his mother think that I should bring my
own food so already you should bring
your own food probably but then you ask
Reddit and everyone's like you should
bring your own food and then you're like
nah
I'm not gonna and then posting it again
and everyone's telling me you should
telling you you should have brought your
own food it's crazy
he needs to be audited
this is insane
you're the [ __ ] they did offer to
accommodate you by allowing you to bring
your own dish
you're the [ __ ] wholly entitled
you'll be single soon enough you don't
you don't know that okay
I understand that like it feels good to
type it you don't know that
they could in all other ways be an ideal
partner and just be like insanely crazy
about this one specific thing
okay no literally nobody uh disagrees
I have to go it's so funny too that like
there's dinosaur chicken nuggets in the
related posts I have to look at their
original comments first just to see
they have not commented on anything they
need to they need to tell me what their
diet is I'm sorry
because if it is I mean I'm it's not
going to get much better but it could
get a lot worse if it's dinosaur chicken
nuggets
deleted their previous post maybe maybe
okay we did this one am I the [ __ ]
for not wanting my husband to go to his
ex's funeral that was a crazy one
remember that one
am I the [ __ ] for prioritizing my
son's dog over my wife's pregnancy
deliberately written to be as incendiary
as possible for sure this is a the rare
not the [ __ ] because someone was
asking for some not the [ __ ]
when my son 14 was eight we got a dog
he's half Great Dane and half some dog
my friend's dog met during an
unauthorized absence
is so good you ever see the post that's
like dog owners oh it's so cute what
kind of dog is it oh it's a half
labrador half poodle it's called a
Labradoodle cat owners what kind of cat
is that orange
it's half Great Dane and half some dog
my son loves this dog and does all the
care for him and is a very responsible
dog owner my wife is 12 weeks pregnant
ever since we confirmed the pregnancy
she's been acting weird around the dog
she avoids him puts her hands over her
stomach when he is around and jolts
whenever he makes noise today she told
me she wants to re-home the dog I asked
her what she's talking about
she said she has been having anxiety
that he will jump on her this is
completely unreasonable he doesn't jump
on people we trained him not to jump on
people or run into people very young
because he's half Great Dane and have
some dog
and I felt this was important for all
dogs but especially one who could grow
to such a large size there's no reason
to think the dog will jump on her she
said there's no way to know for sure the
dog won't jump on her and if he does our
baby could be hurt the dog is never so
much as growled at her she said even if
the dog doesn't jump on her her anxiety
about it is bad for her health she said
she needs the dog Elsewhere for her
safety and the babies I told her there's
no way my son got this dog right after
he lost his mom and imprinted on him
hard sometimes I think he loves the dog
more than me I'm not taking his dog the
dog didn't do anything my wife said I'm
prioritizing the dog over the pregnancy
the dog is is not a threat to her
pregnancy
if there were any other unreasonable
requests I would just do it because
she's pregnant I just can't break my
son's heart over a fear that she has
that makes no sense am I being an
[ __ ]
this man
needs like is is there like a service in
the world where you just give a a man a
nice thing because he's going through a
hard time
he literally did nothing wrong at all
and has been faced with uh with Sophie's
Choice
if you did receive Reddit Gold for this
post I'm not reading this one it's just
that just honestly bro that just sucks
honestly hey this is all I can really
say to you
yeah she's a little crazy right now but
you know I'm glad I'm not the one who
has to tell her that
it's just too sad
TSB that sucks bro am I the [ __ ] for
calling my boyfriend dumb for boiling
salmon now this is more my speed
can you please take a look at abandon my
spouse at Costco okay I'll look for that
one next
abandoned my spouse at Costco
so this happened yesterday I came home
from work in the evening and saw
something cooking on the stove I asked
my boyfriend and he was boiling salmon I
was taking it back like completely I
asked him to repeat what he said could
you repeat that and he so casually said
it again I was like ooh Who boils salmon
he made a face and didn't reply I told
him it wasn't right and that I never
heard of salmon being boiled like egg
and water type of boiling not not any
other kind of
kind of trendy style of boiling that you
might have been considering I'm like I'm
talking about like like when you heat
water up to the point that large bubbles
are starting to breach the surface and
then you submerge the food in the water
until it's cooked by the temperature of
the liquid I don't know what you guys
were thinking of when I said boiling 20
times is like when you put like an egg
in water type boiling
he said it was all right and he likes it
cooked that way I called him dumb for
with this which he reacted by snapping
and saying who the f says I can't boil
salmon I said um Common Sense he replied
Frick common sense I bet it's no longer
common sense to eat an apple from The
Apple Tree in this time and age what the
[ __ ] are you talking about
what is this the most
incoherent argument of all time
like I'm not saying that he did anything
wrong it's just like what does that mean
it's probably not common sense to eat an
apple from The Apple Tree in this time
and age
we had an argument and he started
ignoring me saying he felt hurt and
disrespected when I called him dumb and
is now waiting for an apology am I the
[ __ ] I mean yeah
your ass literally like walked in from
being out and started a fight in like
two minutes for no reason because he's
boiling salmon that you're not even
gonna eat who cares
I don't understand like I wouldn't it's
not my preferred way to eat salmon it
just makes you look like a kind of a
[ __ ] you know you're like oh I'm
home from honey I'm home from which is
such a stressful day of work you dumb
idiot boiling salmon
[ __ ] for brains like we couldn't say
like hey uh how was your day oh yeah
he's such an [ __ ] oh yeah you're okay
though all right well listen I didn't
know when you were going to be home so
I'm boiling a salmon but you could just
you know there's leftovers in the fridge
if you want
it's just I I love [ __ ] common sense I
bet it's no longer common sense to eat
an apple from an apple tree and this
time and age what does that even mean
[Laughter]
I don't understand
it's provocative
I guess
it's just crazy it's just such a such a
meaningless statement
I call my boyfriend dumb because he
likes food cooked differently than I am
am I the [ __ ] true true
let me rephrase the title for you am I
the [ __ ] for verbally abusing my
partner because they like a different
food than I do that's true am I the ass
over walking away from My Wife and Kids
in Costco
where is it I I I'm trying to line it up
here can you see my mouse point it right
here dude it's in the sidebar it's meant
to be
okay we'll close this
you're the [ __ ] poaching boiling
salmon is very much a thing that's the
other thing I know listen
boiling gets a deservedly bad rap but I
think that one of the reasons to get
such a bad rap is a reason or as a
manner of cooking food is because for
like
one generation or probably more
Generations but you know only one of
them was like alive at the same time as
me that was how they cooked everything
you know they boiled hot dogs they
boiled all vegetables until they lost
all of their color and texture and like
90 of their flavor boiled beef etc etc
but honestly I like some boiled Foods
it wouldn't be my my preferred option
but a boiled
a potato in the right context can hit
the spot man
I'm not talking just about mashed I mean
like a whole boiled potato
absolutely
I'm down with it salmon I would probably
try I mean
I mean you have it's a little different
but like
you could have a fish soup and I mean
you could cook the fish
in like a pan and then add it to the
soup after the soup is properly
distilled but most people are probably
just gonna
throw it in you know with the the
mirepoix and then when there's no pink
left or I guess in the case of salmon
when it's all pink
then you add the the wet ingredients and
get it like slow simmering or something
like that I think boiled gets a little
bit of a bad rap not a not much but a
little
just my two cents so I'm taking his side
even more I don't think it's it means
you have rocks for brains if you're
making boiled fish
he might just be from
the Baltic states
you're the [ __ ] Gordon Ramsay
no you're the [ __ ] Gordon Ramsay I
thought there was going to be like
Gordon Ramsay defines being a [ __ ]
as boiling beef but beef lamb I could
understand but fish sometimes fish the
delicate flavor of fish can have you
ever heard of Dashi
you're the [ __ ] I preferred
pan-seared or roasted salmon to boil
their poached salmon but it's a
perfectly okay yeah no so does everybody
Seth
so does everybody on Earth
boiling is not poaching here's the thing
you call the crow at jackdaw but
if you're trying to poach a piece of
fish at a rolling boil you're going to
end up with a pot of mush she shouldn't
have been insulting but if her
description is accurate boyfriend is not
a very good cook and was likely stinking
up the house pretty bad too I doubt you
boiled boils I saw salmon fillet that is
going to stink up the house pretty bad
what do you do even if he's stinking up
the house too bad you don't call him
dumb as a brick
you're the [ __ ] is boiling salmon
really a battle worth fighting anyway am
I the [ __ ] for walking away from My
Wife and Kids in Costco
Kate the the jury says yes on this one
just for the record
why is this one so the screen region is
all messed up
is it because the post is so long



oh maybe it's fine it's a little
off-center but that's okay
so today the wife and kids when I the
wife and kids went to Costco to do some
shopping while we were strolling
through the aisles we got to the
refrigerator section and my wife picked
up a pack of yogurt drinks
my little one saw the yogurt drinks and
raised their hand as in asking for some
to which my wife said she was going to
take one out and give it to her my son
saw this and asked for one too which my
wife proceeded to do as of right now I
am on the side of the husband this is
not an enormous social faux pas
but you should in my personal opinion
you should not
teach your kids the habit of
eating and drinking food in the grocery
store that they have not paid for yet
it's not horrible like I've seen people
do it
and they're probably like three times in
my life
I have been so thirsty that I would like
get a drink and drink it in the the
store and put the can on the conveyor
belt and be like I drank that while I
was shopping
but that's literally like a once a
decade sort of thing
you're going to pay for it what's the
difference I don't I I wish I had a
better reason for it but it's it's just
not done okay
it's just not something we do
if it feels wrong you're right it
doesn't feel right
I'm not there's nothing really wrong
with it it's just like you know
I wouldn't want my kids to get in the
habit of doing it and then things like
it's a normal thing that people do in
society
it's actually illegal yeah but like not
like a
I understand you could be like
you drink it and then you go to pay for
it and your card gets declined or
something like that and you're like oh
no I stole like that you know water
bottle or whatever but like I don't know
how it is in the rest of the world right
now but people are just walking into
stores and like grabbing [ __ ] and then
like walking out and nobody's stopping
them so if that happened to me like a
one in 10 000 chance that that happened
to me I would probably just be like can
I just come back in like 15 minutes and
bring you bring you the dollar 75 or
whatever
and if they didn't let me I would get a
human rights lawyer on the phone so
[ __ ] fast your head would be spinning
I would drown you in paperwork
from the ACLU we probably have an ACLU
in Canada I don't know who it is it's
probably called like the Lord's Tribunal
for human rights or something
they employ a bevy of barristers and
solicitors
I would
I would rain down legalese
the Moose Council
Canadian civil liberties Association why
does that sound so much stupider
probably probably because it's the first
time I've ever heard of it
anyway
so listen I I'm sure you can't abandon
your family in Costco because of this
but I can at least see why he would be
upset
the second I saw her do this I told her
to stop and would not give them the
drinks as we had not paid for them she
said no it's okay we're going to pay for
them anyway and I replied that if she
does it I'm gonna leave her with the
kids there as it's really embarrassing
in case someone called us out
she didn't listen to me and did what she
said she would so I walked away from her
leaving her with the kids and started
looking at other things moments later
she called me saying I should go back as
the kids had finished their drinks I was
mad but I know how my kids are so I
ended up going back when I went back we
apologized to each other and kept going
out with our day okay I mean it's like
insane but also normal
at least they that should be the end of
it at least now we're at home and she
was acting rude to me and just told me
she thinks I don't care about her at all
and I treat her like crap all on the
base of what happened earlier
maybe some on the base of what happened
earlier so am I the [ __ ] for doing
what I did even though I gave her a fair
warning a couple reasons why I think I
was in the right to do what I did as far
as I know it's illegal to open
merchandise without paying for listen
you [ __ ] Arc
is it illegal yeah it's probably like
illegal speeding is illegal too and like
literally 99 of drivers do it every day
okay there's a there's a scale of
illegality
and if this is actually I don't know if
listen if this is illegal it's like the
least illegal thing in the world
drinking a drink that you haven't paid
for yet but are going to pay for within
the next like 15 minutes
that's like it's a zero out of ten on
the scale from
of crime at the very least
so is jaywalking okay but listen
people aren't gonna like this but
jaywalking is worse not because it's
like more offensive but because it at
least introduces a greater chance of
injury
like No One's Gonna get hit by a car
because they were drinking a drink they
haven't paid for yet in the Costco but
someone jaywalking could either like get
hit by a car or you know cause the car
to have the slam on the brakes and get
rear-ended or something like that like
drinking the drink in the Costco that
you're going to pay for afterwards is a
victimless crime
Atria got arrested for it I hope that he
hired the ACLU man I guess they're a
non-profit but like
I feel he's a genuine like human rights
issue that you're drinking an iced tea
in the store somebody puts you in
handcuffs
there's somebody restrains you like
you're a threat to society
oh he left without pain oh well okay
look
I also don't think you should I I don't
know that much about the legal system
that is like stealing even if it is an
accident I still don't think they should
arrest you for stealing a drink
I think they should just be like
that you just eat it
I mean you're a store they're just like
a guy
I'm sure I've stolen things accidentally
from the grocery store all the time
you know you you get you go through the
grocery store checkout you forget you
got like a six pack of soda on the
bottom of your card or something like
that you get down to your car you're
like
I can't go back in now they'll arrest me
so you just get in your car you drive
home you never go to the grocery store
again without a disguise
it's called breakage it's built into the
the system
that being said I still I think it's
just socially
not
like if I saw a and this is just me
being honest and you could disagree if I
saw like uh
it's it's complicated I was gonna say if
I saw like a family in the grocery store
and they were like eating out of an open
potato chip like family-sized potato
chip bag I would be like oh I feel bad
for the kids because their parents
aren't raising them right but then like
when I was out with my daughter this
weekend I got her a croissant at the
grocery store and then we went to
another store she was just chowing down
on that croissant in the grocery store
or in the in the other store but I mean
the other store didn't sell croissants
but it also seems crazy
that um that would be a reason why it's
acceptable if it's not acceptable in a
like it's it's okay to buy a croissant
and then eat it inside of the Best Buy
or whatever
but if she was like looking at an iPad
inside of the Best Buy that wouldn't be
okay
it's just weird
you know what my philosophy is now and
maybe this is I'm coming around on that
he's definitely the [ __ ] here but
like
My New Philosophy for the past couple of
years I used to be like oh like you walk
into a store you have like a half open
drink you like look at the security
guard when you go in and you go I
brought this from outside and they go
who [ __ ] cares like I'm here to make
sure that there's no riots
I'm here to make sure nobody walks out
with like a flat screen and not trying
to stop like 75 cents where the ice tea
from getting lifted
now I just let it ride and I I know I've
said this a few times I
would welcome the day I fantasize about
the day when they're like sir sir and
then they I'm like I paid I bought this
Santa to save on I bought this in Savon
and then they put me in cuffs and I'm
like you guys are gonna regret this oh
you are good just give me one free hand
so I can open up my online banking app
and show you look look at that receipt
guys I hope you enjoyed this because
this is the last day you're ever gonna
experience peace at this business
I'm gonna put the whole system on trial
you mess with the raw you're messing
with the wrong guy
anyway
yeah I would say it's definitely like a
little crazy
but like it keeps me going
just you know shopping is mundane
sometimes you have a little fantasy of
getting arrested by a security guard and
then proving that you actually legally
did pay for this in a different store
and then like you know suing the
business for like I don't know we don't
have to put a number on it because it
makes it too real maybe like 10 million
dollars
something like that
anyway
um
it's also trashy and embarrassing to do
it if people notice you do it listen I
do think it's trashy whether or not it's
embarrassing that depends on your own
personality
you want to talk about trashy I'm just
real I thought I had no anecdotes
I actually I have a few very simple
anecdotes from this weekend I was
walking uh with my daughter Saturday
morning a runner ran by us he got like
10 feet in front of us and then turned
his head to the right and Unleashed like
the biggest snot rocket I've ever seen
in my life what is wrong with people
but at least he didn't do it next to us
but like at the same time like we have
we learned nothing from the past three
years
it's a snot or phlegm
you know it's like in the shower when
you're like
that's trashy
I bet it felt good
I mean it looked like it felt good let's
put it that way
I saw a dude spit inside the elevator
that [ __ ] is vile that's disgusting
that is so gross
anyway let's say okay we gotta
have been pretty good at teaching them
that wait my kids are not easy going as
in they don't take no easily but I've
been pretty good at teaching them their
limits giving them stuff this easily
only makes the problem worse however my
kids do understand that you can't open
anything in the store until you're back
at home or in the car I don't want them
to think it's normal to just open or use
store merchandise please excuse my
language errors as English as my second
language Kirkland's signature is the is
the true lingua Franca of the world
though now listen you are the [ __ ]
for leaving your
family inside of Costco that being said
it sounds like based on your wife's
reaction when you got back and also your
reaction in the first place to be like
well I'm Gonna Leave
uh it seems like I mean it's just life's
hard right
it sounds like you're trying to set
stronger
standards and regulations for your kids
and like all the work that you put in to
do that whether it's right or wrong is
undermined by your wife being a little
bit more relaxed which probably is like
annoying it makes you feel like you know
what am I even doing here so I might as
well just go if you're going to overrule
me all the time which is not the
appropriate reaction
but I can see why he would be frustrated
then it also sounds like she's
frustrated because you know you you
walked one aisle away and your wife was
like everything's fine and then when you
got home she was like psych she's
probably got some stuff bubbling over as
well maybe you're not the the great
husband and father that you think you
are
just I mean it it just sounds it sounds
crazy but normal
like it's not
that I mean it's not as crazy as the
Christmas ones that's for sure not as
crazy as the picky eater
issuing like an ultimatum to their their
future mother-in-law this is just like
you know it seems like you're both
stressed out let's put it that way
you're the [ __ ] that used to work at
Costco and nobody cares as long as you
pay for it that was definitely like a uh
a wake-up call for me was when I
realized I don't need to tell the
cashier
who's like 16 years old and making
minimum wage at the grocery store that
this is actually I bought this iced tea
someplace else
they're literally just trying to scan
the stuff and like
you know finish their shift without
being yelled at too much either by their
boss or by customers they're literally
just like
they're just there
they might if you stole it they might
even be rooting for you
I think you're overthinking it you're
way too concerned with some strangers at
Costco might think of you and due to
that unnecessary anxiety you're being a
jerk to your wife and making a big deal
over nothing sure well
I think he's making a big deal over
almost nothing
because I don't want my kids eating the
food in the grocery store either
it's not a huge deal but it's just like
I don't know for me it's like it's a
faux pas
I don't have any reason for it it's just
not something that's done
[Laughter]
I I'm trying to like
evaluate my own reasons for believing
this but
anyway the wife commented that he also
left her with a full cart and a stroller
that she couldn't handle by herself so
he essentially left her stranded in the
middle of the store unable to move and
to stroll around and look at other
things don't know where her comment went
but it needs to be at the top you're the
[ __ ]
I mean that's true I mean I just it's
not like a revelation for me that's like
um
that's implied because you're at Costco
nobody's going to Costco and then
picking up a basket
I mean that's just crazy
you would go to like a normal store if
that were the case
there's no shot two normal adults are
arguing in the Reddit comments I don't
know man I it's so mundane
that I could see it
I'm gonna choose to see it because it's
more entertaining this way like the WWE
so you think your wife is trashy and
embarrassing no
no
the action she took was trashy and
embarrassing that doesn't mean she's
trashy and embarrassing
I'm not trashy I do some trashy things
now and then I drink my coffee on the
toilet every morning just to save time
I'm not a trashy person I'm fairly
buttoned up if I have a couple trashy
habits I guess
you know people aren't just like a
hundred percent refined or a hundred
percent undignified there's there's
Shades of Gray
I have a two and a four-year-old and
I'll tell you how we handle this my wife
goes alone to Costco during the
two-year-old's nap so we don't all have
to go into a hellscape of chaos and big
feelings and over stimulation together
and she brings me back a hot dog you're
the [ __ ] for not being more like my
amazing wife this is like the heavy uh
remember that post from one of the best
Tweets of 2022 which was like my amazing
wife just got back from a 12-hour shift
as an emergency room nurse and now she's
shoveling the snow
and then it was like a picture of him
drinking coffee while looking at his
wife shovel in the snow at 5am or
something like that bro you didn't do
anything
also what's wrong with you I I don't
have a two-year-old and a four-year-old
I have a two-year-old I'll take her ass
to Costco it's no big deal
she likes it that's what you do like you
know when she was a a baby it was
different
like when she couldn't walk on her own
but now she loves going on errands and
stuff you take your you know why you
take your [ __ ] two-year-old into
Costco is because one day they're like
not gonna be two
you might as well have them realize
there's a normal what are you talking
about as a a hellscape of chaos and big
feelings I get that she's a kid so like
it's a much bigger event for her to go
to Costco than you but like
I don't understand what do you why are
you making it sound like such a big deal
also like no this
okay now I'm becoming the redditor I'm
going like too far
so your ass is just at home
probably playing Xbox while your kids
nap
she's going to Costco alone and you're
you think you're both helping like
why are you why are you adding like a
superiority complex for this other guy
at least this other guy is [ __ ]
pushing the sled you know he's at the
Costco with his wife and kids
but I also don't understand why can't
you just go why you don't have to go to
the grocery store with your kids every
time you could divide the labor big deal
but like at the same time
why not just normalize going to the
grocery store with your children why are
you making it sound like it's you're
you're dropping the One Ring into the
fires of Mount Doom
it's the grocery literally like millions
of people do exactly the same thing or
worse every day
why are you making it seem like it's the
final boss
let's just apparently you can just give
them a yogurt drink and they'll calm
down it's not trashy apparently it's not
trashy
grocery Souls everybody sucks here
perhaps the kids don't take no easily
because they're not told no in
situations where they should be like at
Costco excuse me Costco is all about
saying yes
it's one of the most yes stores on the
planet
every time you pass through an aisle
somebody says would you like free food
all you have to say is yes
that's it this is if there's a single
grocery store where it should be
normalized to not say no it's probably
Costco
your wife shouldn't have done that
especially if it made you that
uncomfortable and you shouldn't have
just taken off they're your kids too if
they're really that difficult you get to
stay and help manage them I'm not saying
it would have been the end of the world
let the kids eat at Costco the point is
they clearly don't hear no often enough
the point is based on this one story I
think they're bad parents um also mother
of three here so you can't criticize me
even if this is truly insane
I don't understand the mentality that
he's an ass cause I'm the opposite I
hate when people do this because how do
you know you'll be able to pay for it
even if you have money in your account
I've had issues with bank cards not
working and having to leave the store
empty-handed go call my bank and deal
with them not to mention I think it's
stealing and just plain wrong to do
because there's no guarantee that you
will pay for it I've worked in Walmart
and I've seen so many packs of things
opened or only one taken out of it I
feel until you have scanned and paid it
shouldn't be open but that's my opinion
the thing I think maybe you could be an
ass for is leaving her in the middle of
the store okay good strong reading
comprehension I would agree with that
assessment he would he might be
considered an [ __ ] for leaving his
family in the middle of a Costco
with alone with two kids sorry I forgot
the second part
I have very bad social anxiety so when
my mom has done things like this I leave
as well so I can understand not wanting
to be around when it's happening and for
the people talking about kids and being
hungry while shopping that's why you
feed them before you go out I would just
feed them forehead listen
just a little too
is like I also have this problem and
it's unsolvable but here's how I would
solve it I would simply feed my children
before they go out I would make sure
they've had proper nutrition 24 hours a
day
why wouldn't you just feed them forehead
I don't understand
but why don't you just do your homework
or bring your own snacks with you
but then what if you bring your own
snacks
and they're eating like this is why it's
it's it there's humor in this situation
I just can't figure out how to tease it
out like it's inside of the geode but I
can't crack through the exterior
why is it so much worse
to eat goldfish
that you picked up inside of the store
than it is to bring your own goldfish
from home
and then eat them inside of a store that
sells goldfish because if if part of the
thing is people are going to look at you
and judge you they're going to look at
you anyway
you should pick it up on the store shelf
and then if someone looks at you go
don't worry we brought these from home
even if you didn't and then just hope
that you don't have to exit the store
empty-handed and then call your bank
afterwards
also I might be crazy
I feel like if you
I think if you bought under 50 of food
at Costco
and your card got declined three times
at the register don't quote me on this
okay
I feel like they might just let you have
it
just to keep the throughput going now
they might not
but like the metaphor or the comparison
that I'm thinking of
is like when you're in the McDonald's
drive-through
they this is very Canadian but they they
put the interact machine out on a hockey
stick and then you tap as soon as you
tap they say proceed to the next window
they don't say wait for it approved
declined whatever as soon as the the
beep comes out they're like get the hell
out of here
so I feel like they're basically like if
it gets declined we'll eat the 10 cost
because what are we going to have you do
we can't have you back there's 17 cars
behind you in the drive-through
you know we all get evaluated based on
our efficiency like it should be like
you order and then three seconds later
the food is in your hands right so they
I think they just
I think they just eat it
I bet with like one in 50 orders gets
like transactions gets it gets declined
and they just they eat it that's my
expectation at least
no they don't
I don't know because like honestly
just in general I would say I get
declined
one in 150 times
and then like uh
they go oh our machine's a little busted
even though it might not be and then I
just tap again and it's like approved it
happens all the time
that's so much I don't know because it's
like half bad machines and half bad
internet and then the third half is like
sometimes Visa is like wait a minute
he's making a four dollar purchase at a
grocery store he goes to four times a
week that's probably fraud and then you
tap it again and they're like never mind
the thief would not try twice
like I don't know there's some kind of
AI like fraud detection going on that
hits false positives all the time
I don't know
yeah play dude don't even get it used to
be like every time I went to the US I
would like I I knew it would happen I
would like tap my card or do like chip
and pin at a uh
at a grocery store and then it would be
declined and I would be like
okay sorry and then I would go call my
bank and then I would come back into the
grocery store and buy the food that I
was gonna buy like it can't they're just
like so Hey listen hey hey excuse me Mr
Letourneau this is a very serious
issue do you recognize this six dollar
and four Cent transaction at Whole Foods
Bellingham yes that's me trying to buy
uh two apples
all right
how about these 700 these seven hundred
dollars in uh iTunes Apple gift cards
those are legit right no I've never
heard of those before in my life okay
sir have a nice day whatever you say
anyway where were we on this one as
someone who works in retail I can say we
all judge you and it's always annoying
when people do this not the [ __ ] Ops
right to feel embarrassed okay we're
learning people have different opinions
okay which is fine but I here's the
thing I also feel like if you work in
retail
like I would be judging everybody it
wouldn't even be like oh they're eating
in the store you could just be like a
normal person I'd probably be like so
bored I would be judging your ass for
nothing and it would be my fault I would
just be look at [ __ ] wow nice shoes
idiot oh did you find everything you're
looking for today sir have a nice day
you too you too [ __ ] idiot stupid
shoes look at his damn shoes
walking like an [ __ ]
coming into my store buying two
cantaloupes what are you doing there Mr
cantaloupe
so that like I feel like at least for
some people no matter what you do you're
gonna get a little judged can't live
your life just trying to be free of
judgment
walking
anyway I don't know this just seems the
issue doesn't seem like you abandoning
your family in Costco the issue seems
like what led for you to be so
frustrated with this one issue that you
abandon your family it seems like you
have like uh some unresolved issues at
home that it would be well served for
you to handle
before it leads to it because I don't
think reasonable people are like one
disagreement they're like my ass is gone
that's like disagreement number 50 where
they're like what's the point
am I in the [ __ ] for laughing at my
niece's gifts
he wasn't so upset that he had to leave
he told her if they did it he would
leave so he did what he said he'd do
yeah but like you can't do that when you
have kids like that's
you forfeit the the right to have the
ultimatum
you can't just be like oh if you throw
your plate on the ground daddy's gonna
like abandon the family oh you did it I
don't have my hands are tied like that's
why you don't issue the ultimatum to
begin with because like you know I
there's only two options you don't
follow through on the ultimatum because
the following through would make you the
world's biggest [ __ ]
and then your ultimatum looks weak and
you lose like you know some Authority or
you follow through and you're just like
an enormous scumbag
OMG my dad did that I can't
no he didn't probably
he just walked an aisle away like to me
this honestly like even worse that he
just walked an aisle away because just
like he wanted to exercise some power
and he was like all all turned both keys
on the nuclear football don't test me
and then she was like do it [ __ ]
and then he's like I'm going to the egg
section I'm leaving the cheese section
to go into the egg section like it's
just such a
like it's just an aisle away but at the
same time the fact that it's just an
aisle away is like even more pathetic in
some aspect you know
like if he had left it would have been
crazier like if he'd gone into the
parking lot it would have been crazier
but in some ways I would have respected
it more because he at least stuck with
his guns
anyway
am I the ass over laughing at my niece's
gift
my 12 year old niece is really into arts
and crafts recently got into crocheting
Before Christmas she told me she had a
surprise gift for me and she seemed
really excited I told her I was looking
forward to it as well and prepared her
gift myself which was actually art
supplies
so far so good
on Christmas when we had our family
gathering she brought me her gift and
was super excited for me to open it
I saw a crocheted animal but if I'm
being honest it looked really really bad
to give you an idea of what it looked
like imagine something from bad
taxidermy but in crochet form I couldn't
help but burst out laughing and I
couldn't stop laughing no matter how
hard I tried to suppress it so I had to
excuse myself to go to the washroom
where I locked myself in for nearly 10
minutes this is the Joker
clinically insane uncle
when I came out my niece was in tears
with their parents trying to console her
I apologize profusely and told her I
really liked her gift she kept crying
and shouted at me calling me a liar and
then she sucked it out my niece avoided
me for the majority of the party after
that I tried to make her feel better by
displaying her gift on my living room
cabinet but my wife told me my wife
pulled me aside later in the day and
told me to take it down after the party
because in her words it was really ugly
and made her uncomfortable okay this is
not real but yes you're the [ __ ]
it's a gift from a 12 year old child the
point is not that it looks good
you know if you want something that
looks good buy some art
it's a gift from a kid
I don't understand like
I don't know it's just weird
like you're an adult don't you
understand that the way that this
dynamic's supposed to work
your child gives you anything they give
you like a rock you don't go wow it's
just a what is this just a stupid rock
you go oh my God thanks for this cool
rock where'd you find it you know it's
just it's a kid
a rock pug I've always wanted a rock
really really I swear
I was just telling my wife man we don't
have enough rocks
update hold on where's where's the
original post here
maybe it'll be better with just the
update
update no longer cooking for my
girlfriend this is a rare post
it's not an even an am I the [ __ ]
Wednesday after I served the plates my
girlfriend said she didn't want pasta
and was going to make a salad I was
pretty sure she was gonna do this and it
didn't bother me
pause champ I am Ponce champing I waited
for her to come back to start eating and
when she sat down I tried to talk to her
about her day she asked if I was trying
to make a point I asked what point
she asked if I cared that she wasn't
going to eat what I made I said I didn't
and would have it for lunch she got
frustrated focused on her salad and
wouldn't engage with me after dinner I
said we shouldn't make dinner for each
other anymore she asked why I thought
that I said it's clear she gets upset
when she makes food for someone and they
don't eat it it would be better for us
to make separate meals
so we each know what we will get what
that we will get what we want and no
one's feelings will be heard she said it
wasn't okay for me to make a universe
unilateral decision about our
relationship I said I wasn't but I
didn't want to cook for her anymore or
have her cook for me if she's just going
to get upset we kind of went round and
round on it until the conversation
petered out
she texted me at work Thursday that she
was going to make salmon I decided that
if she tried to cook for me I would just
let her so she'd feel like she won one
over on me
and we'd draw a line under this
she ended up making salmon only for
herself which I was quite surprised by
because I was expecting her to try to
convince me to have some I made a quick
omelet and sat down with her she asked
if I was upset she didn't cook for me
and I said no even though I was
again she accused me of making a point
she asked if I was gonna cook for her on
Friday I said no she was put out Friday
she was upset I only made enough Curry
for one person and called me greedy at
this point I'm over it also I just
ignored her what are you talking about
what is going on man
this fight lasted like a whole week
also who makes Curry for one
it's built for bulk cooking I'm not
saying anything's like I don't think
anybody's in the right on this one but
that it does seem a little bit like a
shot across the bow to make curry for
one that's like oh hey hey for dinner
tonight I'm making chili oh yum nope
just for me I'm making a single bowl of
chili
I gotta read the original post
let me find it here
am I the [ __ ] for wanting hot food is
this the same issue a separate issue I
don't know
how does it get to that point it's it's
is crazy
they must be in love
yesterday I went ice skating with my
girlfriend Tuesday is one of her days
for dinner so she made chicken salad
when I saw the chicken salad I admit I
made a face she was like what what's the
problem
I said we were outside in the cold all
afternoon and I wasn't really in the
mood for cold food bro
that's so funny
I don't understand
foreign
like a warm house
like what's the problem
I bet if you offered his ass some ice
cream he would be like yeah sure
I said we were outside in the cold all
afternoon I wasn't in the mood for cold
food she said we're inside the heat is
set to 74.
what the hell
it's like uh
they're in the boiler room right now
you trying to
close a deal on a used car sale
74 were both wearing warm dry clothes so
it was plenty warm enough to eat salad I
said sure I just wanted something warm
to heat me up on the inside she said
that's ridiculous because my internal
temperature is in the 90s and my insides
are plenty hot at this point we were
going around in circles because I
couldn't argue with her biological
factual case
so I said I was just going to heat up
some soup and told her to go ahead and
start eating because I'd be back in a
few minutes when I came out of the
kitchen with my soup she was clearly
upset she asked how I would feel if she
refused to eat what I made tomorrow
which is today I said I won't care she
said that was BS because it's rude to
turn your nose up at something someone
made for you am I the [ __ ] for not
wanting cold salad after being cold all
day you're just in an insane individual
you're just a little crazy
ass chicken salad
s
it's just like
probably once or once every react chord
I say this but there's some truth to it
like isn't life hard enough to not
manufacture problems
thank you sometimes in your life you
will
I get it when you're a little kid and
your mom makes roast beef once a week
and you don't like roast beef you're
like I can't wait till I'm older and I
can just eat what I want every day and
never have to eat roast beef again well
two things first off when you get older
you're gonna like roast beef
I don't know what it is okay but the
older you get the more you actually
derive enjoyment from food that doesn't
taste that good it starts to taste good
for you for whatever reason when I was a
kid my grandma would make roast beef all
the time I was like I hate this even she
even made gravies and sauces and stuff
to put on top of it I would kill for
that roast beef now
ain't nobody's serving roast beef now I
don't know you got to go to like an
Applebee's or something
I guess I could make it at home but it's
it's not the same
regardless
the other thing is when you get older
you realize not every dinner is a sacred
ceremony where Daddy's special boy or
girl gets to eat their favorite food
some dinners are better than others some
dinners you get to eat exactly what you
want some dinners you compromise you eat
something that someone else wants and
you're not gonna die if you eat room
temperature I don't know if I guess
chicken salad is not room temperature I
don't really know I guess you'd probably
mix it and keep it in the fridge so it
would be slightly cool but like
it just seems like
like you don't need I mean I guess I'm
I'm beating around the bush which is
that just because your ass was in the
cold all day doesn't mean you need to
eat hot food to warm up
also your ass didn't have to cook so
just eat the food like it would be
different if she made you [ __ ] you
know like boiled [ __ ] or something like
that but that's the way that the dinner
rotation works if you want to eat what
you want to eat you can cook dinner
every night
otherwise if you're alternating every
night then you cook the [ __ ] you decide
what to eat on your night and she
probably goes yum even though she wishes
she was eating chicken salad and then
when it's chicken salad night you eat
the chicken salad and you say thanks for
cooking it's the easiest like
relationship
qte you're ever gonna have in your life
it's not that big of a deal
and then it look it's turned into like a
10-day fight
am I the [ __ ] for wanting hot food
it's the rare honest uh title because
yes yes you are the ad that is why you
want it and it does make you the [ __ ]
you sound so this is their comments you
sound so heartless actually 62 beats per
minute
I don't know why you're copying so much
heat on here you simply sound logical
their reply it's because some people are
scared of other people not thinking
exactly like them it's okay doesn't
bother me you made the post more on
obviously it bothers you
if it didn't bother you
you would have kept that [ __ ] to
yourself you were looking for validation
from the internet you 12 year old
and you made an update you made two
posts about this non-issue
there's a good resting heart rate though
you know what probably from all the ice
skating it's probably because your ass
is so cold
from from ice skating you're damn near
frozen to death
by the [ __ ] for wanting hot food
[ __ ] you
too far too far
I'm locked in a loop here I keep I keep
going back and then clicking on
something and then I'm back in the
recursion I just keep seeing Ops posts
I'm cursed here it's a Christmas carol
am I the [ __ ] for not letting our
kids eat my wife's cooking
let me see
I don't know I don't have an answer yet
here's a question is it cold outside and
did she make them chicken salad
because that's over the line
throw away
i-34m have a wife and we have two
children four F and 7M I work as a
manager at a care home and my wife owns
a bakery with her mom my wife cooks all
the time because she's much better at
cooking than I am I cook sometimes she
is the one who takes care of the house
kids and chores
you're you're already behind the eight
ball on this one my brother
want to see how it's got what's going to
happen from this point onwards
yesterday when I came back from work
dinner was ready so I plated it up for
everyone well my wife was washing her
hands my kids like their food cut up I
was cutting their chickens into pieces
and it looked a bit pink I told my wife
to look at it and she said it's a little
pink but it's fine I told her I'm not
letting him eat this if it's pink she
told me to stop being a baby and it
won't kill them I kept telling her it's
pink in the middle they shouldn't eat it
they could get food poisoning is
dangerous she told me if you don't like
them eating it you can cook their dinner
I made them cheese and ham Toasties also
made her one but she didn't eat it
that's crazy
she told me she isn't talking to me if I
think her cooking is horrible so I don't
think it's horrible I just don't want
our kids eating that I told her to stop
thinking she was right so am I the
[ __ ]
listen I mean as the resident expert on
salmonella
the you I personally I recognize that
this puts me not as like the majority
take but I take food safety very
seriously now like if I'm cooking I wash
my hands like 20 times till like the
skin is peeling off between my my
fingers and I like it's cooked all the
way through because just because I
recently went through it right
that being said
maybe this is too forehead why didn't
you just throw the chicken
in the microwave for like 45 seconds or
something
if you were really like a like paranoid
about it why didn't you just nuke it
like I know you're like that wouldn't
taste as good they're [ __ ] four and
seven years old
they don't know anything no disrespect
of any four and seven-year-olds are
watching this I'm just saying
this just is more about getting them
like a healthy hot meal in a timely
fashion and not blowing up your whole
night right
you definitely should not have taken a
meal that if if I had to guess I bet
it's like
98 cooked if it's not 100 cooked
I do like the Joel microwave spam don't
get me wrong why did you take a meal
that was 98 cooked and then say scrap
that I'm making ham and cheese Toasties
you should have just tossed it in the
oven tossed it in the microwave listen
she probably still would have been
annoyed I would be annoyed
this is like a fairly normal household
situation you know
you cook a meal and then your spouse is
like why are you trying to kill our
children and you're like I'm not that's
done and they're like you are a murderer
yeah I would be annoyed but I could also
understand wanting the to make sure that
the the chicken is fully cooked don't
get me wrong but definitely if they said
no this is not good and then they cooked
an entire separate meal then I would be
super offended so yeah I would say he's
the [ __ ]
get my man out the damn microwave
like you're the [ __ ] for making a
grilled cheese it just sounds like you
wanted to eat a grilled cheese I can be
there dude you can make one after the
kids go to bed just eat it for yourself
and so being an adult is all about
why didn't you put the chicken back in
the oven in the meantime you're the
[ __ ] pink chicken is not dangerous
if the internal temp was high enough
also instead of saying oh honey I'm
worried the chicken's a little pink can
we cook it a little more you said I'm
not serving that to the kids that made a
new meal altogether
chicken might still look pinkish at 165
but it's still totally fine to eat I
didn't know that
you know I should just buy a meat
thermometer why is my ass like cutting
into a chicken breast and then trying to
put it under like the most objective
light source that I can find and then
being like is there a little pink in
there I don't know is that what chicken
looks like when it's is that a is that a
little and then you know just get a meat
thermometer what's wrong with me
it's going to be an incredible purchase
you got to get one
all right I mean I can't imagine it's
too expensive
should I just use the one that uh that I
use to take my temperature rectally so I
couldn't figure out how to make the
sentence
can I just use that one
as long as I wash the chicken breast
afterwards
I'm joking
can I just okay so two working parents I
got it my wife cooks all the time
because she's much better at cooking
than I am I cook sometimes dang it's so
unfair how women are just genetically
better at cooking than men are women
these are you [ __ ] he's just
describing their home situation
you didn't say all women should cook
more than me because I'm a man
said his wife is a better cook maybe she
likes cooking she cooks more
this is just crazy that this says 23 000
enough votes
also she works at a bakery
I know we we went through this last week
it wasn't even a react Court I can't
remember when I said if my wife was a
janitor I'd make her take out the
garbage because she's so good at it and
then people were like Boo
even though it's true
[Laughter]
if she works at a bakery she's probably
good at cooking so you know why doesn't
sure do you play to your strengths at
home I take out the garbage guy I have
more muscle mass on my upper body so
when there's this [ __ ] waves [ __ ] 300
pounds in one bag because we cleaned out
the fridge
my ass automatically is on the hook
you play to your strengths
if my wife was an accountant I would
expect her to handle our taxes sure
I wouldn't expect there to be like uh
you know oh I do taxes all day why don't
you do them I'd be like is this just
serious hunting
I don't want to go to debtors prison
I don't think I could lift 300 pounds
probably true
fair enough
how heavy is your garbage I don't know
it's probably like 15 pounds at most
sorry
edit for everyone saying what I wrote
was sexist it's a statistical fact that
women are responsible for 75 percent of
unpaid domestic labor worldwide
but let's
but he's not the world though he's just
the guy I'm like what
I don't understand how that applies to
the situation
also you think you could probably make
an assumption that he's not
you know
helping out in that around the house I
guess he did say she does most of the
chores all right you know what everyone
roast him get his ass
also yeah who cares about worldwide no
no disrespect this this [ __ ] is in
England
they're making Toasties it might be it
might be 80 in England for all I know
my bias is that it's probably lower than
75 but I guess what do I know
my appreciation for people to take the
time to create these beautiful comment
treatises with quotes from the original
post and beautiful snarky responses for
each terrible piece is truly infinite
that is uh I don't even know what that
emotion is you have made my morning a
bit brighter smiling Emoji thank you
it's my superpower
ungasslighting the world one comment at
a time holy yuck gaslighting isn't real
you're crazy thanks I was beginning to
think that I almost down voted you you
beautiful scoundrel
holy cow just a bunch of people making
stuff up to feel Superior
like the dude made a mistake it's not
he's not like emblematic of every
problem on planet Earth
he's a misogynist because his wife does
most of the cooking plus she works at a
bakery
it seems a little rash to me but what do
I know
foreign
you're probably both technically right
but there's other issues at play yeah
okay no don't leave a comment unless
you're gonna be crazy okay
don't leave reasonable comments after
insane comments
by the [ __ ] for snapping at my friend
who keeps ditching me because I now have
a child
I just why would someone snap at you
because you have a child
this is a fun one all right I'll take
your word for it
oh no sorry I've got it backwards the
friend the person with the child is
snapping at their other friend who keeps
ditching them I can listen I'm let me
just read the post but my initial
judgment is
you know I remember what life was like
before I had a kid if someone was like
hey come to brunch with me by the way my
18 month old is gonna be there I'd be
like no that [ __ ] makes me uncomfortable
I don't know how to handle myself around
babies because I have uh exclusively
since you know like age 10 only talk to
people my age or older
not scared you'd just be like
what's that baby doing here you know you
you'd be like what's going on
can I say the f word around the baby can
I say the s word around the baby
is a baby gonna throw up on me it's a
baby gun when you when you have a kid
you get used to it like Mighty fast let
me put it that way
Hey Joe hi there thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
appreciate it let me put it this way
okay if
nowadays if we were eating dinner and my
daughter had like a huge fart and pooped
her pants and stunk the place up
I would finish my plate and then I would
change your diaper
but like if you don't have a kid you
would probably throw up and cry and you
would be like upset
you just get used to it
I'd poop too in a restaurant well here's
the thing I would probably let her stink
of the restaurant for like two minutes
just because you don't know like if she
pooped and you changed her diaper
immediately she might have one in the
chamber
it's just the way of the world
you don't want to be in there changing
her diaper and then she poops like on
the bathroom floor you gotta wait till
she's until she's done
it's true 16 in the clip and one in the
hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some
diapers turn cold
just over two years ago I F 29
unexpectedly got pregnant and now have a
beautiful 18 month old daughter Sierra
over that time my friend Circle got
considerably smaller but my best friend
remained Mia
doesn't have kids nor wants kids but
she's been brilliant with Sierra I am a
stay-at-home mom obviously don't have as
much time to hang out as I did
previously Mia and I live on the same
street we're in Manchester England it's
a walking distance between our houses
I've told me a numerous times she can
just pop in whenever she wants to she
works from home but she rarely does she
did at the beginning but it's been
happening less and less instead she
keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or
P yeah because it's not like no
disrespect
when it's your kid it's different
because that's your [ __ ] life
you got no options she's got options
most people would not some people are
psychos they like love babies most
people are not willfully going to be
like oh it's Saturday morning let me go
spend time with like a a straight not a
strangers but like my friends 18 month
old
but they're like five or something
they're cute they can talk they can walk
around they could come out with you to
fun places when they're like 18 months
they're just crazy
why does stay-at-home mom sound like an
automated ground-to-air missile platform
surface-to-air homing missile
anyway I don't have the time and always
just tell her to come over and we'll
have a coffee at my place she asked if I
wanted to go out with her and her other
friends for a drink last week and I said
no but she's welcome to come over and
we'll have a few drinks at home she said
she already had plans and it felt weird
to drink when she knows there's a child
around honestly I feel neglected I feel
like she put me on a back burner it
doesn't want to be friends anymore I'm
always available but she rarely comes
over I don't think it's fair listen I'm
I know I'm like a complete hater here
but like of course you're always
available
like with
you have an 18 month old because you
can't do anything
duh like this
we got like a 20
I'm trying I can't do the math anymore
we got a two point x whatever year old
yeah I'm always available I can't do
anything
but if you come over to my house you
will find me here in all likelihood
but if you were like hey can you come
meet me I'm one Sky Train Station away I
would be like I cannot do that I'm sorry
it can't be done
yo Daniel thank you for the raid thank
you listen this isn't with no BM Daniel
I told you the lions were going to beat
the Packers
I told you I know it ended up not
mattering
unfortunately because
um Baker Mayfield like literally can't
complete a pass to save his life or or
successfully get a first down but I told
you
please leave him out of this
I watched like one quarter of of the
Seahawks Rams game
I'm gonna pretend to be a uh a football
fan
Baker
Dan if your wife was a baker and she did
all the cooking at home
do you think it would be fair to be
described as a misogynist responsible
for
women doing 75 percent of unpaid
domestic labor worldwide
don't answer that it's a it's a it's hot
potato
what the heck
anyway
today I saw her photos from Saturday
night and I was fuming my friend ditched
me so she could go and drink like she's
20 again I feel rejected and horrible I
thought we were best friends but she
clearly doesn't value me when she won't
even have a few drinks at my house
like for those of you just joining us
this is a woman with a young child she's
eight the child is 18 months old she's
mad at her best friend for ditching her
for not spending as much time with her
since she's had the child and the
context is that the mom can't go
anywhere because she has a child so the
friend will be like hey do you want to
go get coffee and then she's like sure
why don't you get coffee and bring it
over to my house
every single time
but also
why does it matter
if your friend who doesn't have a kid
was out partying like she's in her 20s
on the weekend she doesn't have a kid
what do you want her to do come over to
your place at 7 15 a.m and watch you
know Bluey with you you had even though
you're the same age you got different
stuff going on in your life you got
different priorities and
responsibilities
Bluey don't listen Bluey good show maybe
this will be my most controversial take
good show overrated
once a month I'm going to keep beating
the drum until I get some people on my
side because it's not that Bluey is bad
it's that when people talk about Bluey
they're like I love Bluey me and my
totally sane spouse sit down and watch
an entire season after my baby falls
asleep just because it's so entertaining
even for like a 35 year old other shows
like Sesame Street and Peppa Pig are
full of bad examples
Peppa Pig is she's jumping in muddy
puddles that's crazy every episode of
Bluey is about how uh the dad got uh
diagnosed as pre-diabetic by his doctor
and he needs his family's help to get
his blood sugar back in check every open
episode of Sesame Street is like Hey
we're introducing you to the concept of
water with a bunch of songs that are
like Broadway inspired
it drives me crazy
Peppa Pig does stay goated I'm not
saying it's even as good as Bluey but
it's just not people that they they
think bluey's here and like all other
kids shows are like here it's like
[ __ ] Bluey and then like on the same
level or maybe even a little bit higher
is Sesame Street I'm sorry to tell you
and then like Peppa Pig's probably like
a little under Bluey
Sesame Street goes crazy
that's why Bluey has like 23 episodes a
season Sesame Street has like eight
they got celebrity guest stars they
write their own songs [ __ ] they're
building puppets every year
Louie could never
aren't there 4 000 episodes of Sesame
Street
no there's like I don't know there might
be like a thousand but this [ __ ] has
been on the air for 53 seasons
it's been on the air since 1969.
you know Elmo didn't even exist until
like 1986 or something like that like
Elmo is like a late season Edition
okay there are four thousand still how
many episodes of Bluey are there versus
the fact that it's just been on the air
for eight months
foreign
exactly
what's the episode to season ratio
that's what I'm trying to say anyway
it's not about more episodes equals
worst show how it's made's got like 10
000 episodes this [ __ ] is better than I
don't know I was trying to think a show
that doesn't have a lot of episodes
um what is any Netflix original post
2018
because they get canceled
after one season regardless of how many
people watch them
anyway
when she finished work she called and
asked if I fancied going for a coffee to
town but I asked her to come over again
she said yes before she disconnected I
heard her Mumble like always
this really annoyed me when she came
over I decided to be open about
everything and while now my proudest or
most mature moment I shouted at her that
she's an awful friend right now that she
barely comes over if she doesn't want to
spend time with me then just say it and
stop playing around she she said she's
always been accommodating but it's been
two years and she doesn't want to spend
time with me when there's always a kid
especially now that she has to watch her
language because Mia likes to swear I
said that she knew I had a child of
responsibilities and she said that Tom
could take care of Ciara once in a while
so I could have time off this felt
really intrusive I told her to mind her
own business and not meddle in my
marriage I was really angry with her and
kicked her out she called me a selfish
[ __ ] on her way out normally I
wouldn't expect her I would have
expected her to call by now with
apologies but she hasn't done show done
so and I'm starting to wonder was I the
[ __ ] or was she perhaps I was too
harsh and should have been more careful
with discussing it yeah like you're the
[ __ ] like no disrespect
really but
I mean you gotta when you have kids and
your kid is around all the time you got
to respect that your friends might not
want to spend a bunch of time hanging
out with an 18 month old child
why not disrespectful because she's
probably like bored as hell
stay-at-home mom looking after the kid
all the time a friend won't even visit
her for coffee always wants to go out to
fancy places like Starbucks instead
I can definitely understand but like
yeah you're the [ __ ]
I don't know what else to say like
can't you have your husband look after
the baby for a little bit by the way and
then just go you don't have to go to a
bar and party until like 3 A.M
but you could have like two drinks and
be like oh it feels like we're back in
uni and then like an hour later get
really tired and take an Uber home like
I don't understand
it sounds like you're you're mostly just
bored which is completely understandable
and you want someone to you know drink
coffee with and shoot the breeze while
you're also watching your kid but like
it kind of sucks for the other person
to constantly be expected to go over and
hang out with a little toddler all the
time
it's different like I think if you're
like if you enjoy it or if you're like a
family member
like when if my mom was like I don't
really want to come over because you
know your baby is sort of annoying I
would be like what the hell
but if Corey was like I don't really
know if I would get along with a kid I
would be like that's totally fair I
don't even putting words in his mouth he
might be totally fine with it but
but I probably wouldn't ask just because
it feels weird
but your friend is an [ __ ] for not
having a kid at the exact same time
because then you guys could have hung
out all the time
if she had just gotten pregnant like
right when she found out that you were
pregnant you guys would have like a
friendship that's unbreakable right now
so I guess she's kind of like the
[ __ ] in that situation
she didn't want to have a baby so what
they're best friends
you're the [ __ ] she did not ditch you
she asked you to go out with your
friends as she'd made plans she's not
drinking like she's 20. she's drinking
like someone who doesn't have a child PS
she's right your partner can go look
after your daughter once in a while and
should try to bond with her but you
don't know there's always the dads man
is literally like one sentence in the
story that's like by the way I have a
husband his name is Tom all the replies
are like Tom doesn't have a relationship
with your child when your child grows up
she's gonna never talk to him ever again
he's literally just he's not even in the
story
Tom Works 14 hours a day in an asbestos
mine
he's the union head
[ __ ] you Tom
can you look after Sierra for a night I
know you gotta wake up at 5 15 a.m to go
to your your third shift or whatever but
I want to drink like I'm in my 20s
over 60k Karma y'all are crazy
I have a child that completely second
this nobody wants to have a little kid
around every single time they see their
friend you can't talk with each other
freely the parent is always distracted
maybe you don't always want to hang out
at home with someone's toddler
that's damn true
I'm not even sure if parents realize how
much of the conversation when there's a
kid around revolves around the kid
no we know
we're not stupid probably smarter than
you quite frankly
I oh is Kaylee a big girl does Kayla
need to kiss her mama peek-a-boo
peekaboo yeah so anyway I was down at
the bar and I was like Yaga bombs Jagger
bombs [ __ ] uh and then I was like oh
I shouldn't drink anymore but then I
drank some more than I [ __ ] threw up
it was crazy I had a great time
[ __ ] you
think you're so interesting
every time I'm out for a walk I see all
you all you childless [ __ ] FaceTiming
all the time and then I said and then
she said and I was like why would you
say something like that like do you
think that she would say something like
that if maybe I'm just being crazy shut
the [ __ ] up
you think you're so damn cool
and they were roommates
do you need a snack where's bear bear
did you lose bear bear do you need Aunt
friend whose brain is turning to jelly
to help you find bear bear oh okay Lee
it's okay mama will give you a kiss it's
unbearable
then [ __ ] who asked live on five user
received 8 000 Reddit awards for this
post for no reason whatsoever
you're not invited you know what no
credit for you
I'm not giving you any gherkins okay
you don't get the sparkling water
you get the Still Water and you know
what not even out of the fridge out of
the damn kitchen sink no glass cup your
hands
you're the [ __ ] you're always
expecting her to accommodate you because
you have a child she's been coming over
to your house for a year because she
understands your life has changed you're
putting on very little effort and
assuming that's it's on her to maintain
the Friendship why because you're a mom
she didn't ditch you you've been a bad
friend that's all true see that's the
thing is like I'm on
their side it's just like the kid didn't
even do anything everybody's like the
mom's the [ __ ] but someone's like uh
people don't realize how annoying it is
to hear baby talk when you're not a baby
let me make up our old [ __ ] unhinged
conversation about me
remember you're just looking at your
phone 95 of the time anyway even when
adults are talking to you get over it
you know what forget oh don't flatter
yourself you're not coming over to my
house
you're not invited okay
info why can't Tom take care of Sierra
once in a while so you can have time off
hey don't be meddling in op's marriage
sarcasm tag yo but no sarcasm tag
you don't know anything about their
marriage but we have a happy marriage he
babysits my kid while I cook him dinner
sarcasm tag it's literally you Source
you [ __ ] me
psycho you're crazy
was anyone else surprised she had a
husband I thought from the most of the
post that she was a single mother
honestly she sounds like a single mom
and instead of dealing with the source
of frustration her partner she expects
everyone else to accommodate her what
are you talking about
it's true Source I wanted to be true
just like maybe Tom is horrible but like
can we at least wait for her to post
like he's horrible before we say he's
horrible
sounds like the kind of guy to consider
taking care of his kids babysitting AKA
an absent father she is literally not
doing anything
like I don't mean he's not doing
anything in the life of his child I mean
literally he's not even part of the
story
I'm a parent and I still can't stand
when someone only has their kids to
discuss same with the job it gets boring
fast okay then like be bored I got [ __ ]
on the go I don't know why it's like I
I'm putting myself in the mom's shoes
which is crazy because I'm not on her
side in this post at all okay if my ass
is boring don't come over again I got
other [ __ ] going on it's like more
important than entertaining an adult
like you should be able to handle that
for yourself at this age
sorry you came over and I I didn't learn
like a new juggling routine for you like
I was just trying to have a conversation
about the [ __ ] that's going on in my
life but I guess our friendship is
completely predicated on uh me
constantly having new and interesting
things to say to you I didn't realize
there was like some the level of like
unconditional support is unreasonable to
ask for instead it should just be like
hey so let me [ __ ] uh made up a story
the other day look at this
thank you
am I the [ __ ] for telling my cousin
that this isn't a grief competition okay
I'm not reading that one
Tom will not be in rush hour 4.
am I the [ __ ] for saying no to my
in-laws taking our kids to Disney
Maybe
Disney what you gotta learn people just
say Disney now
because it's not uh like a place it's
like a lifestyle because there's
Disneyland there's Disney World but then
there's also California Adventure then
there's also there's there's the Villas
and then there's the uh the Grand
Californian and the Mexican Riviera in
the it's a whole it's its own thing
there's cruises maybe you've heard of
them maybe you're wearing a shirt that
you got on one right now
perhaps



my wife and I have two daughters six and
five years old which is prime Disney age
I'm not going to disagree with that but
I would say that in the eyes of the
Disney Corporation Prime Disney age is
approximately I'll say three till you
die
they're both super into princesses and
all that we've talked about taking them
to Disney over the next few years as we
know they'd love it my wife has never
been before and I've only been once when
I was 10. not prime Disney age it was
definitely a memorable trip for me as my
family had to save up a while for it
we've always known Disney would be our
big trip with our girls
in July my father-in-law got diagnosed
with prostate cancer after a few rounds
of chemo and some intense stays at the
hospital it's only gotten worse it
spread across other organs in his body
and rather than trying to suffer to
fight it he's opted just to not do chemo
and to try to live with what time he has
left as a result him and my
mother-in-law have decided to make more
memories with family one of these
memories was to take our daughters to
Disney and surprise them with the trip
yesterday during Christmas all right
you're you're
here comes the part here comes the pivot
at first I thought my wife would be
against it as well we've always said we
wanted to get to experience taking them
and seeing their faces however I found
out my mother-in-law cleared it with my
wife last month my wife didn't tell me
because she thought I would be surprised
and excited for our daughters my wife
assumed that I was a normal uh person
unfortunately I've been deluding her for
uh our entire relationship up to this
point
I sat through the rest of the night but
when we got home we had a serious
discussion about it I told my wife I
didn't want our daughter's first trip to
Disney to be without us
she suggested we go along but the trip
is in February and booking flights Hotel
tickets just for my wife and I for the
time they're all going is going to be
almost five thousand dollars
are they staying in Walt Disney's
penthouse
do you live in Antarctica
how long are they going for
I told my wife that we have to talk to
her parents and decline the trip but my
wife is saying I'm being selfish and
Heartless by robbing our daughters of
this experience and robbing them of a
core memory with my father-in-law before
he passes am I being out of line here
yes
yes
like
listen
idiot sorry
not only are your kids going to have
like a great vacation
you're going to have like a week
of like no kids
that's like a decade's worth of of
childless adult living you know you get
gold you could go golfing
you could go to bed at like you could go
see a movie every night you could go see
all the movies you've missed out on the
last decade check out The Big Short it's
a good one okay
you could just nap you could do whatever
you want and the only thing you miss out
on
is you aren't the person who takes them
for the first time to Disney which is
fine because like with no disrespect to
to Super into Disney adults
it's just like a place it's not like
you're not walking her down the aisle or
something like that and you're like I'll
get you on marriage too
like it's literally just like a vacation
like who cares
your in-laws are giving a free vacation
to your kids which is also going to give
you and your spouse some
breathing space like you should just
take the dub
can't you you just get a photo of them
when they're like at Disney
and be like that's what their faces
looked like when they saw a real fake
Mickey Mouse for the first time
also yeah their father-in-law their
their dad is dying their Grandpa's dying
just trying to make some memories with
the family like yeah obviously you're
the but here's what you know what you
should do you should make sure they get
the genie pass right because if you just
go and I know how the older Generations
are don't buy the fast pass that's how
they get you they got you the second you
made the reservation all you can do now
is decide whether you're going to spend
all day in line or like 50 of the day in
line you gotta get the genie pass or the
magic band or whatever you got to get
the fast passes where available you got
to download the app
though if you're already spending five
grand you should just throw in the extra
100 bucks to maximize it I hate to say
they are they got you if you didn't want
to get got then you know your ass should
have gone on like a road trip to see the
the world's largest moose statue or
something like that
hey Ryan son H thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
you're the [ __ ] your wife is right I
understand you're disappointment and not
being the first to take your kids to
Disney I I don't
different people can have different
opinions and and values don't get me
wrong but I'm not even giving them this
much credit like what's the problem
if my parents are like Hey we're going
to take uh is it cool if we take your
daughter to Canada's Wonderland I would
be like
cool you know like is there any way can
I help you can I can I
give her some cash so she can pay for
some meals or something like that like
this is what a nice gesture
Canada's Wonderland is in Disneyland
yeah but Disneyland isn't like a sacred
place it's just like
it's cool
it's a nice place to spend time but it's
not like you know it's not like a
religious the monument or something like
it's just a
it's a vacation destination
I like it I'm just saying
you could just give her like a
churro at home or a turkey leg or
whatever you go to a renaissance fair or
something
they want to be there and see their
excitement
yeah but like how what put a put a
number on it
because that's what he's doing he's he's
saying five thousand dollars is too much
which is completely reasonable by the
way
but like at the same time
he's he's the one quantifying it so I
guess we're starting the bidding of 4
900.
I just can't understand being like I'm
gonna I mean maybe this is putting it in
the worst Faith way possible but like
I'm depriving my two kids of a vacation
because I want to be the one who takes
them on that vacation it's not like a
stranger has taken them it's like it's
their grandparents
like you're basically saying like sorry
girls you can't go to Disney this year
because like I
have a weird attachment to the
corporation like I need to be the one
who takes you you can't go to Disney
with you everybody knows you can't go to
Disney with your grandparents for the
first time
every every five and six-year-old
remembers every second of their first
trip to Disney and it has to be with
your parents otherwise it's just it's
just not the same thing
it's just weird
it's not weird to want to have memories
with your kid there's such like a insane
take what is weird is like no you don't
get to make the memories until I make
the memories
like your grandparents like your parents
taking your kids to Disneyland is such a
huge dub for all three generations and
you're just
you got a weird hang up that's leading
you to throw like broken glass on the
track
he's trying to ice skate uphill I'm not
afraid to say it
anyway
um
you're the [ __ ] your wife is right I
understand your disappointment and not
being the first to take your kids to
Disney I I listen I know I got stuff
like by the exact same line after
talking about it for five minutes I
don't I still don't
these are special circumstances
if you if your father was not dying it
would be an insane request that they
take them on vacation
because he has a horrible terminal
illness we're going to make an exception
he wants to create memories with his
grandchildren that will last once he's
gone it's small-minded and selfish to
take that opportunity away from him and
your children just so you can be the
first to have the experience with them
do you think if you do this your wife
and daughter won't resent you I mean yes
thank you same same comment I think
though
it's Disney they'll light up every time
regardless of being the first trip yeah
they're kids
of course
you think he's going to take his kids to
Disneyland in like four years and
they're gonna be like Mickey Mouse and
all he's going to be thinking about is
like I bet they were more excited by
Mickey Mouse when my father-in-law took
them
it's just not the same kids
oh you really liked
Lilo and stitches Hawaiian Turkey Leg
last time you were here
I wanted to introduce you to Lilo and
Stitch's pineapple braised Hawaiian
Turkey Leg but I guess that's okay that
you have like all those good memories or
whatever
just so weird
everybody sucks here what
probably unpopular opinions the second
diet's comment
you are reacting poorly I get this is a
memory you want to be able to make with
your children for it to be a once in a
lifetime first
your wife and in-laws should not have
hid this from you yes he has limited
time that is not a reason to cut you out
of parenting decisions
I agree in principle but I think that
what's really the situation here is that
they just expected you to be like a
normal person
and be like whoa have a fun time girls
I mean like if you want to again in
principle I agree but you know if your
kid is staying at her grandparents house
for three days do they need to call you
before breakfast and make sure like
you know it's okay to have oatmeal this
morning and like eggs the next morning
and like uh you know be careful we might
go let me call you back we're on the way
to Denny's right now we'll get and then
at lunch at the same time it's like it's
you can take it to the extreme
it's yeah it's not a like a it's not
like hey I'm gonna
you know give your kid
you know like a beer and they're six
years old it's like it's Disney is what
it's made for
you're the [ __ ] don't take this
incredibly thoughtful gift away from
your children yep
yep yep I would say
it's Disney [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] drive to Florida
okay I'm going against the tide here but
I see an easy judgment your in-laws are
not the [ __ ] they asked them we're
granted the opportunity I can actually
see your perspective
I would want there to be it's just a
simple rule of Reddit by the way the
less line breaks you see the more insane
the comment is going to be so I this is
why I went for this one right away
I would not I would want to be there to
experience my child's first trip to
Disney too however you and your wife
have exhibited poor judgment she should
not have agreed to this without your
input that is not acceptable my only
thought is she's too focused on making
her father's last days joyful to
consider all angles what a [ __ ] dude
she's she's so selfish
is
how could you write that sentence with
like a straight face and make no uh
edits it's crazy
she absolutely should not have agreed to
this without your input this is not
acceptable my only thought is she okay
you have been presented with a tough
situation wrong
in my opinion in my opinion wrong
but are more focused wait sorry you have
been presented with a tough situation
but are more focused on your own
feelings than those of everyone involved
the problem is your in-laws and children
are blameless in this okay we're almost
there you're in-laws and children are
blameless in this
that only leaves two people and you know
you're not wrong so it must all be your
wife's fault
is that where we're going with this
it would go well for you it will not go
well for you to yank this opportunity
out from under them however I would like
to point out another issue have they
really thought this through there are
two people have somewhat Advanced age
one of whom has terminal cancer and is
doing chemo and they want to chase two
insanely hyped up young children around
Disney for however long you and your
wife really need to find a way to go
because I don't see that ending well for
them okay thank you doctor thank you for
your comment that says nothing at all
I wonder I wonder if the person with uh
cancer thought about that
might just be like a random person on
the internet with no expertise or
whatever but like
let me explain it to you okay when
you're sick
you might not be able to catch up to a
four-year-old kid in Disneyland okay
you're the [ __ ] come on man dot dot
dot even Joe Biden knows
that this guy is the [ __ ]
you're the [ __ ] big time you're the
[ __ ] that grandparent has very
limited time you're the [ __ ]
unpopular opinion not the [ __ ] okay
well I think we're kind of going around
in circles here
either way I'm like
is maybe is my favorite like am I the
[ __ ]
theme is just people who are just
getting in their own way for no reason
guy who started a uh
10 day long argument with his spouse
over like he didn't want to eat chicken
salad because he had been outside in the
cold all day like you just
relax your life sit down simmer
eat the chicken salad
she's going to be like I gotta go to the
bathroom real quick when she goes up to
the bathroom eat a granola bar
it's not a big deal get an electric
blanket or something these are all
solvable problems let your dying
father-in-law take your two kids to
Disney World enjoy the photos that you
get you know because it's a Once in a
Lifetime experience that they're going
to make this memory together
take your wife out for two date nights
in one week you may never get the
opportunity again until you know your
kids move out of the house
sleep in for 30 minutes it's probably
been eight years since you slept in for
uh 60 seconds you sleep in for 30
minutes it's gonna feel like you had a
14 hour sleep you're gonna work off like
a decade of sleep debt in a single week
just get out of your own way man it's
not that hard it's Disney
Bob Iger would
to throw your ass in a garbage disposal
if it brought the Disney stock price up
a quarter point and you know what he
would be right to do it because that's
the obligation the CEO has the
shareholders in his messed up system
okay
but he would do it in a heartbeat he
would say thank you so much for treating
Disneyland our profit generating theme
park Enterprise with the reverence it
deserves now get in the garbage disposal
I'll hit the button
you think Bob Iger would do the same for
you
no no shot dude
still just 23. Francis Phenom mbappe is
having another world cup of a lifetime
that one's uh that's not on am I the
[ __ ] that is
an ad from The Wall Street Journal for
some reason a little very Timely
am I the [ __ ] for telling my daughter
she could learn something from my
friend's daughter who got a job she
didn't
I'm 49 and my daughter is 22. I've
changed the names in this post my best
friend Tom's daughter Kate is an
architecture major she got accepted to
college in California and graduated with
good results my daughter Anne also went
into architecture and she's doing well
she's generally a quieter person she
does tend to laze around a little bit
both Ann and Kate applied for a job at
the same firm
which is co-owned by Tom's brother she
didn't end up getting the job but Kate
did and she was very upset she's moved
on and got offers from a couple other
places
okay we had a friend's Christmas a
couple of days after by the way I'm
starting to understand why so many
people you know go into architecture
when your best friend's brother owns an
art how many architecture firms do you
own in your circle of friends and family
I don't think I know a single person in
architecture but I also don't know
anybody who owns an Architecture Firm I
have to imagine if I did I would the
number would shoot up I guess it's not
causal it might just be
coincidence but
we had a friend's Christmas a couple of
days after actual Christmas where some
of my college buddies and their families
got together the conversation turned to
Tom and his wife and they were talking
about Kate's new job I saw Anne and Kate
talking and we congratulated her we all
came home and this is too many details I
don't know what's happened what get to
the meat
we all came back home together and left
her car at our place and I went back to
her apartment after who cares
this is why all architecture Majors must
be forced to take a persuasive writing
class because this is just the in it's
inefficient communication there's too
many details
I don't need to know where you're going
to be running the the water and gas
Mains through I just need directions to
to get to room 6108 okay
it's a load supporting sentence I bet it
is
she started saying she has to work so
hard to get what Kate gets handed to her
I said this is a competitive field and
Anne should be more diligent she blew up
at me and my wife saying we're egging
Kate and Tom on and apparently Kate told
Anne she could help her out I eventually
told Anne she needs to stop sulking over
Kate yes maybe Kate had an edge of the
firm but from what I've heard from Tom
she always works on herself and is
getting better and Ann could learn
something while Ann got pretty angry
after that
both me and my wife called her but she
didn't answer I don't think what I've
said is wrong but my younger daughter
thinks otherwise and said I should post
on here
who cares
it's not that big of a deal
I don't I'm not I don't feel like I
should say you're the [ __ ] I'm just
like I don't know enough about your life
to I don't I can't compare the CV of
your daughter and the other person based
on this situation
I I guess like you know you should
probably be a little bit more supportive
of your daughter in a situation like
this but at the same time like I don't
know it sounds like
I mean it sounds like she got nepotism
right like like she had a
nepotism connection to the firm but
somebody else had a better one
and now she's like I hate nepotism
I don't know and that's what I'm getting
from this post that it's it's seven
paragraphs but it says nothing at all
it says nothing of value
um am I the [ __ ] for telling my
family they can't use Spanish on
Christmas day or my husband and I aren't
coming uh
laughs
probably it'd be worse if your husband
was doing it that's for sure
do we even have to read it I like The
Crazy Ones
my family is Mexican and we live in
Texas everyone in my family is bilingual
they tend to mix English and Spanish
constantly my sibling spouses have all
learned some Spanish some better some
worse but they can still participate in
all conversations I've been with my
husband for 10 years he took a few
classes but found it too difficult and
decided that he can't learn a language
as it's just as it's his thing just like
math isn't his thing and he dropped it
okay what's his thing because we got two
things that are not his thing
what is his thing
can I I need to jump to his defense a
little bit okay
I've been
well this will be our nine year wedding
anniversary in May
so I you know I've been married decade
for nine years
her family all speaks Korean
I don't speak Korean
sometimes people are like why don't you
just learn Korean
because I [ __ ] don't want to no
disrespect I got other [ __ ] going on you
know I got like a I got a job to do I
got a household to manage I got like my
own hobbies and stuff like that it's not
if they could just like Jack it into my
brain and it would be there I would sign
on the dotted line but it's like a big
undertaking
so you know what happens they add
chusock and sonal and Christmas and
whatever everybody speaks Korean
and then my ass just like eats the food
and it's completely fine
it's not a problem in the slightest they
have conversations I'm sure about people
that I am not
even aware it exist distant uncles and
cousins and so on and so forth
and I just eat
the yummy food
and have a great time every once in a
while they want either Kade or maybe
kade's sister or brother-in-law they'll
translate for me and say like this is
what we're talking about right now and
then I'll add like a comment or
something like that and then they'll go
back to talking in Korean and I just go
back to eating the food and it's
there's like actually nothing wrong with
it whatsoever
I never feel slighted in fact one time I
went to Kate and I went to her parents
house for chuseok which is like
it's Korean Thanksgiving but it's also
like
there's a religious significance to it
it's to having to do with your you know
honoring your ancestors in particular
instead of just the food that you're
eating
um
and while we were there you know they
set up the Feast for the ancestors and
stuff like that and then we we all sat
down on the floor and they handed me a
Bible and then her parents like sang
hymns with us
but like my ass is not religious and a
bad singer and their English is not very
good they clearly would have been
happier to be singing it in Korean so I
just felt like actually I was an
imposition
they they should have just been singing
it in Korean and my ass would just be
eating the food again
it was a nice gesture but I actually
felt like over accommodated which is
fine but
also like no disrespect to uh the
religious the hymns don't follow the
conventions of music that have been sent
out in 21st century pop and rock music
the syllables are all you have to have
heard the song like they're like oh the
words are in the book yeah but like the
notes are not in the book and then
sometimes there's like a run-on sentence
and sometimes there's like a they they
drop a syllable on a word and
sometimes you're like you you say over
the mountain you look like an [ __ ]
because everybody knows it's or the man
the mountain
every Valley shall be freaking exalted
and and the hills laid bare
so it's you can't just give them the
book and then be like just follow along
anyway
sorry sorry
foreign
I've been to church I've been to
weddings
a few funerals I got baptized which is
crazy I never got confirmed which is
crazy because if they had just like I
don't remember my baptism but they
should have just gone through with the
confirmation
because then my ass will be snacking
every single time
I get that I could and nobody is like
asking for your ID when you go up to
take the sacrament but it just doesn't
feel right like if
you know it feels like too much of an
edge Lord thing to do for me to like
walk up and be like um
just kidding father
the stolen Sacrament like I'm not I
don't think that it's gonna create uh
you know a problem for me in the
afterlife or whatever I'm just more like
you know it just seems disrespectful
anyway I forgot what I was talking about
did I even read this whole that didn't
even come close I'm just saying it's
just it to me it's the same energy when
people are like oh if I had uh if my
spouse's family spoke a different
language I would simply learn the
language yeah sure and if you lost your
hair you'd be jacked with like a six
percent body fat if your ass could do it
you'd be doing it already
I don't know what language it is oh what
if I what if I picked the wrong language
and I accidentally just happened to
learn a useful language but it's not the
right one then I'd feel stupid yeah
listen to yourself
some people do and some people don't
I said do you speak of my language
she just smiled and gave me a Vegemite
sandwich
and she said
you come from a land down under
anyway also the other thing is because I
lived in Korea I know enough to at least
laugh when it's time to laugh
Burger King
Burger King
dude I know I recognize that word
I can't Burger King I can't
what's a vampire's favorite drink
Kopi
[Laughter]
Kopi is Korean for coffee
but Kopi is also two words Co is nose
and P is blood nose blood what's a
vampire's favorite beverage nose blood
[Laughter]
oh man
anyway I can't I can't
the kids I was teaching used to go crazy
for that one teacher do the vampire joke
again
anyway
I've been with my husband for 10 years
right he simply can't learn Spanish Okay
I accept that I'm I'm in the same boat I
mean I could learn Korean I just I mean
honestly I don't want to invest the time
I don't know what you want me to say I'm
not gonna make up a bunch of fake
excuses here's the thing it's hard and
like
my ass is just I don't have the
desire to be honest
looking to say it's not my thing I'm
sure if I dedicated a lot of time to it
I could I got a head start I you know
I'm I'm ahead of the average for sure
I would love to speak it but I don't
want to go through the work of having to
learn how to speak it and I think that's
okay
every family gathering he feels left out
okay well there's your problem idiot
idiot you should look forward to being
left out you can think about your own
stuff you could you know look at your
phone now and then it's no big deal
he feels left out because everyone
switches back and forth and he doesn't
understand them I have to translate for
him and it must be really uncomfortable
for him this year he said he's not
coming he feels excluded what is wrong
with you just it's okay
different people speak different
languages
you if you're not going to learn that
you can't have it both ways you can't be
like I'm not going to learn the language
but also I'm gonna be mad that they're
speaking that language
you know like you might think about it
this way okay they're one generation up
there speaking Spanish okay you're like
I don't want to learn Spanish please
talk in English you don't know you might
have three kids they might marry people
from three different parts of the world
I would just get used to not being able
to understand what everyone's saying it
frees you from the chains of of the
social contract
your ass could just be watching TV
they all speak English I it's true but
at the same time I think like if one
person has not bilingual comes
and then it's like hey can you guys just
like completely you're supposed to be
relaxing right it's the holidays can you
completely uh
change the way that you speak
naturally when you're relaxed uh just to
accommodate me
my ass would be like no it's like a
self-fulfilling prophecy too
because you probably weren't talking
about his ass to begin with but he was
like hey can you guys speak English
next time they speak Spanish they're
definitely talking about his ass
100 and it's not going to be flattering
this year he said he's not coming he
feels excluded even when he talks with
non-mexican spouses they mix and match
languages and he feels like it's to mock
him because there's no need to who even
are you what do you mean that you just
go you feel like you're being
condescended to when somebody speaks a
different language just like what's
you're not the main character it's okay
you think they're like whoa check this
out never seen this one before someone
who doesn't speak Spanish crazy can you
will get a load of this guy
anytime I'm saying anything not in
English it must be they're [ __ ] talking
me for not speaking Spanish
I called my mother and told her they
must promise not to speak Spanish
because it's excluding my husband or
we're not coming my mother was angry she
told me they're not going to police
their speech and they were accommodating
for the first few years and it's it's he
made no effort it's ridiculous he
doesn't even try I told her he did try
but she knows it's difficult for him she
said he's no longer invited I can come
on my own I was really angry and
repeated my ultimatum this did not go
let me know how that goes uh
this did not go down well my whole
family's pissed off my husband is on my
side and I don't know anymore am I the
[ __ ] for giving them the ultimatum
yeah I definitely think it's messed up
to
basically ask your family not to speak
their native language
at the holidays just because one person
doesn't speak it like I do I think
that's crazy
and I'm kind of like I don't know if
this makes me less based or more based
but I'm in the same situation in the
sense that like I don't know what is
being said that a lot of these dinners
I know my role
I say Hello nice to see you again
handshakes and hugs I pretend to follow
the conversation for a while then get
lost in my own head and then I reach for
the bill when it comes that's the and
it's just normal I don't like
it's not weird at all
I think here's the thing it would be
insane if I talked to my wife and was
like hey your parents need to speak
English when I'm around it's
disrespectful that [ __ ] is crazy
I would never have the stones to do it
and I have too much of a brain to ask
for sure then secondarily if if Kate's
parents were like he needs to learn
Korean I would be like [ __ ] that
like
why
we're getting along just fine like when
nobody makes demands of other people
we go out to dinner we communicate on
the common ground that we can find and
then we get in our separate vehicles and
we go back to our own homes it's
completely okay
yeah how about we both learn Farsi let's
compromise
I speak Korean very poorly my English is
fantastic your korean's amazing I'm sure
your English isn't that good let's learn
Farsi together
that could be a good bonding experience
it is it's a little King Solomon but
let's all learn a third language
together so we're suffering equally
anyway yeah I think like
I don't even need like I just I'm trying
to
telepathically Express to this guy
that like
it's just normal
like it's not weird to not speak
like you
in life
I hope that you're blessed enough to
travel to places where not everybody is
going to be speaking
the language that you know especially if
you only know one language
like you should travel and be in like
another country and and get used to the
idea that
you know when you're out at a restaurant
you can't understand what's happening
around you at all times you can't
commits on every conversation you know
instead you have to make conversation
with your spouse
so it's just not it's not weird the fact
that he thinks is a solution that needs
to be rectified and without any effort
on his own part is the crazy part to me
so the way I see it is like there's a
couple of other options or the a couple
of options here one option is like learn
Spanish and if that's not possible the
other option is just shut the hell up
enjoy the food
enjoy being around the family even if
you you're not in on a hundred percent
of the conversation maybe you're only in
on like 35
who cares
watch some football you know then you're
you're good what's the issue
I don't get it
Spanish is kind of easy to learn well I
mean listen
I also
I don't want to get myself into trouble
I don't know if it's easy to learn
but if I lived in Texas
I might put in a little extra effort to
learn Spanish
there's a lot pushing in favor of that
you know
it seems like it would be a little
advantageous
just knowing the Korean alphabet is
enough for me to get around in Vancouver
I went to the Korean supermarket by
myself
well with my daughter actually on Sunday
and the Korean the grocery list was
written in Korean all the foods in
Korean you know what I did I learned the
alphabet like 12 years ago and I was
just like Shabu Shabu sogogi okay that's
shot that's hot pot beef let's grab that
put it in the oh we need some we need
two packs of get me we know we need two
we need a little kimchi we need some
yaochi you know we need some some John
we need some gochujang we need some
gochugar we need some and then uh we're
gonna go to Delaware then we're gonna go
to Washington and
Hangul is really easy on the alphabet
side for sure I was stunned my nieces
like their parents are Korean they were
born in Korea my nieces don't know how
to read the Korean alphabet
I was like I could teach it to you in
like an hour
there's like 17 letters and they all
always sound the way that they're
written
teach us no you should literally just
teach yourself like while you're
watching this stream it's so easy
not always yeah but for their
[ __ ] like 12 and eight they're for
their purposes is always
it's pretty unlikely they're gonna find
themselves in a situation where they
need to make this syllable
I've never even done it
I hear it now and then but I've never
done it
well never on purpose
whether they need to intimidate a snake
they should just say
chocolate snake do you want to die
yeah we're teaching our daughter how to
speak Korean
like his slow going was here's the thing
people also say like
if I had a kid and like I was bilingual
I would teach them both languages
well yeah but like sometimes you've got
other [ __ ] on the go sometimes you just
like eat your damn grilled cheese
yeah no we I mean I say I don't speak
Korean but I speak enough Korean to
teach a little bit to like uh
you know like a two-year-old
I'll say like honey that's grandma on
the phone can you say oh how many
and when I'm at the like when I'm at
North Road Plaza Corey will back me up
on this one when I'm at North Road Plaza
it's like being back in Daegu I'm
walking into convenience stores say
they're saying I say oh I'm saying I say
oh no matter what they say if I don't
understand what they're saying I just go
nay nay
nah and then they'd present me with a
bill I tap my card and then they say
and then I walk out the door
I know a little bit uh I know enough
Korean to get around at least
that's all you need to know how to do in
Korea I I worked with a woman in Korea
we were both ESL teachers one year
living there she never learned how to
say thank you it blew my mind
at that point it's like a willful
ignorance
like I can understand not making an
effort to learn the language but to not
even know
thank you when everybody says it to you
four times every time you go to a store
is just crazy
she was not American she is Canadian
no
no
anyway
you're the [ __ ] while your husband is
the [ __ ] a couple classes isn't
enough to claim he can't get it sure
okay true
him being upset people dare speak a
language he can't and feeling mocked
also isn't anyone's problem but his own
everyone the [ __ ]
ETA with this getting attention I want
to say there's some edit to add edit to
add we're just getting attention I want
to say I know some people simply can't
learn languages and that's not their
fault but to me it seems like the
husband is not trying at all instead of
trying hard and failing listen Mothman
nft
you're like right for the wrong reasons
why should he have to learn the language
I know that this sounds like I'm I'm
coming at this from like the worst Faith
take possible
but like why should he have to learn
even if he
only spoke Spanish let's start there
and it was Texas I still don't think he
should necessarily have to learn English
just because his spouse's family speaks
English if you were to flip the the
languages I still think that it like
he's living his life
if he's able to live his life and the
only consequence of being monolingual is
like three times a year he doesn't know
what people are saying at dinner big
deal
that's like learning a language is a is
a huge endeavor
it's he shouldn't have to learn the
language what he should do is just shut
the hell up about feeling excluded if
he's not going to learn the language
that's the big one
there's nothing like and I maybe it hits
me a little closer because people are
always like well you've like been
married for nine years you don't know
how to speak Korean
no and I don't think I'm Gonna Learn
it's like that [ __ ] is not easy that
doesn't mean it's not worth doing but I
got like you know I got other [ __ ] on
the go
you had nine years and still haven't
participated they've had nine years
they're still not participating we're
both not participating it's not a cold
war it's like a cold piece we're all
having a great time
I'm sure if they wanted to better their
English they would be bettering their
English but they're busy I would love to
have better Korean but I've got other
[ __ ] on the go like we both would live
in our lives
you're the [ __ ] 10 years he hasn't
learned enough Spanish to even get by
that's on his shoulders bro life's
complicated okay listen they're going
after the right guy but for the wrong
reasons
just because you're married to someone
you don't have to speak the language
that their parents speak
that's that was not anywhere in the
agreement to begin with
okay but 10 years
listen
you know right now
that you should exercise more you know
you should eat right you know you should
learn how to cook you've had 10 years to
figure it out why are you not doing it
right now it's different for me it's
different for me it's different for me
if my spouse's parents were both
professional personal trainers I would
make an effort okay you probably would
and maybe you'd stick with it but
statistically speaking probably I'll
catch you in the same chair 10 years
later looking roughly the same maybe a
little worse just that's how things do
with it with the passage of time also
you get as you get older at least you
know if you're roughly around my age the
older you get the busier you get so if
you weren't going to knock that [ __ ] out
when you were 21 Tick Tock [ __ ]
your windows getting even shorter
because you're going to have way more
[ __ ] on the go in 10 years than you do
right now
so I'm just trying to say
I don't think there's any reason he
should feel like he has to learn Spanish
what he should do is just not listen if
they're talking about him they're not go
why would are you stupid are they going
to talk about you in front of your face
in Spanish
that would be so uncomfortable hey
Daryl's here let's save up all this [ __ ]
that we've been storing and just unleash
it in his face while he's sitting there
wouldn't that be funny these people are
not evil they'll talk about you after
you leave they'll be like I can't
believe this [ __ ] hasn't learned
Spanish yet
[Laughter]
knowing his wife is sitting right there
and at any moment could be like uh what
the hell did you just say about my
husband
they'll wait till you leave and talk
smack about you in English Maybe
like just go eat the food watch the TV
cheers
how's the job
how's the how's the house coming along
getting your car go home that's it it's
the holidays just relax but I think the
fact that he people are they're losing
the forest through the trees he
shouldn't have to learn how to speak
space not it's not a a moral failing
that he doesn't know how to speak
Spanish
is a moral failing that he thinks
absolutely everybody should be speaking
English around them at all times so he
doesn't feel left out that's the
character flaw
what if they have Spanish shows on the
TV then you just watch them
have you really only been in a
unilingual situation for literally like
a hundred percent of your entire life
you've never been at like a Vietnamese
restaurant your ass is like eating the
best Pho you've ever had but you're
watching like Vietnam's Got Talent
wondering what the hell is going on
people are like juggling field hockey
sticks you just sit and you watch it you
know you just be entertained by it being
unusual by your standards
you're the [ __ ] 10 years sorry I read
this one
seriously 10 years and the most Spanish
he probably knows is nacho cheese
chalupa por favor bro he's literally
like what is wrong with people
he literally did not say that
he might be in incredible shape
[Laughter]
that's so [ __ ] up I think I was behind
him at Taco Bell ordered a quesadilla
extra mild sauce please so true so true
I was there I was there and op knew how
to say quesadilla that's how I know
they're cultured they like their Mexican
cheese sandwiches to be pronounced
authentically
at the Taco Bell mild sauce would be too
hot for him I thought that you know when
he said extra mild sauce I don't think a
lot of people picked up on the joke I
really appreciate you spelling it out in
a in a more obvious way ketchup is too
spicy for this dude okay we're going
back for thirds
Salt's definitely pushing it fourth put
some pepper in his meal I bet he'd cry
do it literally made like one mistake
and it's the vultures are just circling
around him
I always thought people who say they
suck at math tend to be tend to say
they're good at something else like
English or languages what is he good at
then you're both the [ __ ] what if I
told you that there are more things on
earth than just math and language
there's there's a few more hey for
example like how do you think like all
the walls in your [ __ ] house and the
roof and the pipes all the plumbing all
the all the wires you know how do you
think that that [ __ ] came together the
roads all the infrastructure you rely on
every single day
that's math well at one level but like
you know it's also a lot of hot
shirtless guys just hanging drywall all
day
that's not math that's just that's Blood
Sweat and Tears it may be a Budweiser in
your lunchbox
at first I read that to say he's a math
person but he isn't great at English or
the humanities or language but if he
sucks at math and he sucks at language
skills then what the [ __ ] could he
possibly be good at maybe he's good at
[ __ ] your mom
it's another skill we haven't talked
about here
I bet he could talk your ear off about
the intricacies of the Civil War just
that war but he's an ace said that for
sure okay because he hasn't learned
Spanish now he's uh flying a Confederate
flag everywhere or he's a historian with
a very narrow level of Expo of a narrow
area of expertise and then we're
insulting historians for some reason I
don't really understand
whining and complaining he's good at
whining and complaining he's got a true
talent for that
he also seems to be good at finding a
wife that is good at catering to his
whims
I can't see how he wouldn't have
accidentally learned enough Spanish to
get by after 10 years just by being
around them what are you talking about
this mother [ __ ] will watch The
13th Warrior and be like that's how that
[ __ ] works are you crazy
um in the movie This reminds me of the
movie The 13th Warrior where Antonio
Banderas gets kidnapped by Norsemen and
just from being a prisoner of war in one
year he picks up the Norse language
as she was written by UVA Bowl man
somebody translate for me what uh
haciendo pucheros is
they translate it it's pouting
he was moping
dog house
you'd have to really be trying not to
learn what the hell are you talking
about
my ass been listening to living la vida
loca since 1999. I don't speak Spanish
right I've been with my mostly
Spanish-speaking boyfriend over a year
and even though I don't speak it very
well at all I can at least understand
enough to get by and answer see oh no
that's you don't speak it you liar
I've been with him for a year I don't
really speak Spanish but I know yes and
no that's nothing
that's all you need
I mean as the person being brought to
family dinner that is really all you
need you don't have the pressure to
actually carry the conversation until
you've been a Mainstay on the cast for
like five or ten years like I'm now just
getting to the point where I can lead
the conversation for like five minutes
and it feels good that they've trusted
me with that level of responsibility
like I can get through a whole story
with ups and downs it's no longer like
oh this is really good
you're the [ __ ] I am a white man who
married into a Mexican family I find
that ultimatum disgusting well I think
that's true
I don't speak Spanish I don't expect the
rest of the family to only speak in
English
he's just like me he's me for real
your husband needs to stop whining
either he puts more effort into learning
the language or he deals with not being
able to understand everything it's not
their problem that he has a problem I
told you finally there's other normal
guys out there like me
and it's even better because he doesn't
speak Spanish he's probably bald too
just guessing
it's probably my ALT account
you can also find him posting an r slash
Northern line saying actually today's
stream was really good and NL wasn't
really mad stop writing comments that
say he's really mad he was just putting
on a character for a bit and it did not
make the Vibes weird it made The Vibes
better I went back and watched the
stream again because the Vibes were so
good
anyway I don't know I'm just this crazy
people were I mean you could dunk on the
guy but they they just make like he
already is like showing like a half of
his ass and they're like
imagine if he showed his whole ass just
from this one data point I know
everything about your husband who didn't
even give his side of the story
queso chalupa por favor [ __ ] you
he could use a translator app spend some
time on a language app and learn phrases
let's not delude ourselves into thinking
this guy is going to get himself to
fluency by doing 15 minutes of Duolingo
a day okay that's a bill of sale that
they are trying to pedal on you that
being said I've thought about like what
if I use the translator app at uh at
dinner and I honestly think
that [ __ ] would be annoying as hell if I
was on the other end of it I'm telling a
story that doesn't involve
um the person that doesn't speak the
language and I hold on hold on
Uncle jiwan went to Hanam yesterday and
you won't believe what happened okay
proceed
they were out of Napa cabbage and only
had green cabbage
continue that would be so annoying
well anyway
I think we're all on the same page here
my 75 year old mom has learned enough
Spanish to be somewhat conversational in
less than five years what's your
husband's excuse he's probably working
he's got other [ __ ] on the go like I
sorry
my mom's got more Hobbies than me was my
excuse her ass is retired
she put in her time and now she's
reaping the rewards on the other end she
could do whatever she wants
my family needs me Society needs me I'm
under the gun right now
marker



okay Studio mode
it makes perfect sense
GF and I were having dinner at a
restaurant when she got a text from her
best friend who recently gave birth
and she said OMG she got a C-section she
works as a nurse so she explained it to
me the type of incision they make for
that and how it leaves a scar I then as
a joke said at least she'll still be
tight down there nope all right you are
the [ __ ] uh like
instantly
why why would you say that it's just
it's ridiculous
you can't stop things from popping into
your head although I'd say it's almost a
little bit sus that it popped into your
head to begin with but like
it you definitely can stop yourself from
saying it that's where you could take
responsibility why it's just a joke I
had another great idea for a tweet this
weekend which is every group of guys has
some M effort that says I'm in The
Gallows humor
that's the end of the joke but the if I
had to add like alt text to an image or
something like that it would be like
every group of friends has one guy who's
uh sense of humor is basically just
being weird and then thinking that
that's a personality anyway like this is
it's just a very strange thing to say
like it's inappropriate and I know that
it's like so what but it's like
I mean like imagine if he had said so he
let me put it this way it's almost like
there's an illusion in there like at
least you'll still be tight down there
but the double entender the uh the
euphemism is doing no work because he's
basically saying at least your pussy's
not blown out like it's it's a the
subtlety that you're replying to the
joke is like basically like a meat
tenderizer there's there's no subtlety
whatsoever but you're trying to be like
a little cute with it like look at how
clever I am and then on top of that
um she just had a baby like it's just a
second thing to add to the situation
that makes it like super inappropriate
thirdly you're at dinner with your
spouse why are you talking about her
friend's vagina like that's just really
weird
it's you you know like all the rules of
Comedy are broken
a it's not funny B you didn't read the
room C it's like it it if something's
inappropriate but hilarious then you're
like oh it's Amplified by the
inappropriateness like you shouldn't say
that but if something's like this is
more like Michael Scott like they're in
the boardroom and he's he's talking
about stuff that is just over the line
anyway my GF looked confused and then
said what a weird comment to make about
her friend I said it's a very normal
joke to make and she disagreed tldr
there was some back and forth I asked
her to drop it she kept trying to talk
about it I said to her you're so
insecure then she goes does it make you
feel good to call me that so then I got
really frustrated got up and walked out
of the restaurant and drove home she
called me several times I drove both of
us there come on man this is too much
you didn't leave her you didn't walk out
of the restaurant on your GF you
abandoned her there she's got to get an
Uber back
that's way too far
I was so frustrated I just wanted to get
home so I turned my phone off she showed
up at a par at our apartment 30 minutes
later was really pissed at our apartment
you guys lived in
things has like another treasure the
uncover
and was really pissed call me an [ __ ]
and overreacted then she waited in the
cold for 20 minutes for an Uber am I the
[ __ ] for walking out on her and
leaving there to be frustrated yeah I
mean like
you could just the human brain is not a
perfect machine you could just make a
honestly here's how you play this off at
least in my opinion at least at least
she'll still be tight down there what a
weird thing to say you know what you're
right I don't know why I said that I'm
sorry now are you gonna have a great
dinner no it'll probably be like a
little awkward but you're the one who
threw the nail bomb into the interaction
to begin with at least you'll like leave
with only minor scarring
instead you escalated I mean I've been
there you say something and someone is
like why the hell would you say that and
you're like actually you're the idiot
you're the person that was wrong and you
just amplify it because like your pride
is hurt or whatever but
I mean to then like
I don't know what to tell you to make
the inappropriate joke is a forgivable
sin to double down on it is embarrassing
but then to just walk out but also you
drove her there and you live together is
like I mean what are you doing
I'm not sure it's real to begin with but
it's like if it is real like this is
just not it's just not the way people
behave this is like how and how your
enemies would behave to you like in
their head like I might imagine like oh
man maybe imagine the look on her face
if I just drove home right now but you
can't actually do that because you're
not like five years old you're not
throwing like a temper tantrum
anyway it's very weird
is it all it's very much like an I think
you should leave style situation where
like a social faux pas committed and
then rather than walk it back they just
amplify it like over and over again
you're the [ __ ] for the sexist
comment about her friend's vagina and
for your lack of understanding about
basic biology wait are you saying she
won't still be tight down there
I gotta I've gotta consult with with
anybody in chat an obstetrician slash
gynecologist
OMG it's me the great clown Pagliacci
thanks for the gifted subscriptions
thank you
it's crazy by the way like if you get a
C-section
you know let me put it this way I'm used
to the dental hygienist versus dentist
Continuum where you go in for an app
you're like I have an appointment with
my dentist but actually 95 of the time
it's the dental hygienist that's like
you know scraping your teeth and then
the dentist comes in and is like
x-rays look good
do you floss no here's how you floss I
know how to floss do you because you're
not doing it okay see you in six months
what blew my mind was the obstetrician
gynecologist Continuum which is like in
you have several appointments with your
obstetrician in advance of like a
C-section or or any birth I guess
but then
it's the person that you were talking to
in the meetings that's also the person
who slicing up the abdomen
I guess it's like four days a week she's
in the office like make sure you take
prenatal vitamins and then like every
other Friday she's like I'm getting
yeah every other Friday she's like I'm
getting my hands dirty
thank you
we're just doing we're doing react Court
I know and
you see section uh you don't really want
to know this one this one
um
a a guy's girlfriend her friend got a
C-section and he said at least she'll
still be tight down there
she just walked out
[Laughter]
she's in the process of walking out as
we speak
well then we're in agreement I'd say she
says he's the [ __ ]
right when and where where and what have
these men been taught about a woman's
genitals he probably thinks P comes out
of the vagina too
they always I I know that we go through
this every time we do react chord
I bet he doesn't think P comes out of
the vagina
you're just you're undermining your
point by making him
out to be like even stupider than he is
the thing that you should get from some
of a post like this is not that this guy
is dumb is that everybody's dumb
I'm not saying this guy didn't do a very
very stupid thing that might be
representative of like a character flaw
but within every single person there is
this guy about different things
no it's if you look at something like
this and you say well I'm glad that's
not me then it will be you one day is
because you need the self-awareness to
know that inside of you there's a little
social demon that's like I'd love to
[ __ ] this up for some reason I what I
you know when when you're sitting here
you're drinking an iced coffee the the
metal straws clinking on the glass
you're not hungry you're not stressed
out you slept well
my rational take for this stranger is
that this is what I would have done if I
were in their situation but when you're
there and you're hungry and your joke
doesn't go over well and you've got
simmering resentment because she picked
the restaurant for brunch and then you
got there and she was like I don't
really like what's on the menu and then
you know the compound that over six
months and then you're like oh and I'm I
guess I'll never talk again because I
just made a joke that you didn't like
it's like within all of us
there is this situation we're just smart
enough to avoid it you know 99.99 of the
time but there's a there's a chance it
could pop out
being aware of this demon inside of you
is is in my opinion the best protection
so the idea that like oh this guy is so
stupid this would never happen to me
well I would like to think that too but
I'm not sure if that's the case
hello Josh by the way hello
you're the [ __ ] a huge misogynistic
gross one at that with a predilection to
Baby Tantrums I hope your GF dumps you
you made a shitty comment got called out
on it then decided you didn't want to
face up to your weird comment and left
you stranded her
um it's all true I suppose
a comment by the way that is entirely
inaccurate and not funny in the
slightest P.S why would she be insecure
about a sexist comment you made about
her friend's vagina okay this fair
enough
is Emily is anyone going to tell me
where the P comes out it comes out of
the butt right
I do like I hope your girlfriend dumps
you because of one bad joke it does
happen I mean this is like a really it's
not the joke the thing is like the joke
is
nothing like it people make
inappropriate jokes hoping that they go
over well and sometimes they don't then
you just say oh I'm sorry I don't know
why I said that that was a bad joke and
then it's like uncomfortable for a
minute and you try to move past it but
then like you know doubling down on it
and then abandoning her at the
restaurant is like a little it's a
little much the joke is what if you
farted
in no world is that a normal joke it's
really weird to comment on the vagina of
a woman you aren't sleeping with for All
For the Love of All That is Holy a
woman's body is not just for men's
sexual pleasure listen I think that he
knows that I think he's just stupid
maybe I'm projecting a little bit
but I think if you asked him that he
would be like of course not but in the
moment he was like I'm go I'm an
Entertainer
like he made one comment it let's not
make him out to be irredeemable for the
comment the comment is just something
stupid that he shouldn't have said
the character fly is refusing to
apologize and then doubling down even
further
also this is like not fair but I'm
assuming this guy's you know like in his
20s or 30s or something like that
hopefully not any older than that I'm
sorry like when you're I'm just thinking
of like my own age
you cannot be so upset at a situation
like this that you turn off your phone
it's just not the
I think
when you're 19 when you're 21 when
you're in college you could be like I
don't want to deal with this message I'm
going to turn off my phone
when you're an adult you got some
responsibilities the phone has to stay
on
if anything it's making you
uncomfortable means that you're that's
like Nature's way of telling you let's
resolve the situation
if you're uncomfortable that's like
let's let's
put some pressure on you to fix it you
can't just like ignore your problems and
I don't know cruise down the highway
what about 40.
no I would say like um
I was saying like 55 you can turn off
your phone again
but the thing is they don't want to hear
that turn off my phone I worked my whole
life to turn off my phone I don't think
so
I didn't see a movie between 1991 and
2007 and now I'm supposed to turn off my
phone I'm supposed to not be looking at
Yahoo news
anyway
this friend just had major surgery she
had a six inch incision at it they went
between wait wait you could do that
betwixt betwixt
her abdominal wall and cut her uterus
and five other layers of tissue I think
my uncle had a smaller incision for his
first kidney transplant and your first
comment is at least she's still tight
down there not ouch I hope she's okay or
hey we should take her dinner when she
gets oh come on [ __ ] Saints Mother
Teresa
you ever see the video or the the
reaction image that's like I don't care
that a good thing happened to you it
should have happened to me instead
like that I'm I'm almost feeling like
the inverse of that like if Kate was
like
well you know so the similar situation
not not even close to the same level but
similar thematically
um Kate's sister's family they lost
power when we had those blizzards or
they're in the wind storms and stuff for
like three days
they lived three hours away when Kate
was like oh they haven't had power for
three days I was like oh that must suck
not for a second did it dawn on me that
like oh we should like pack up our car
with a bunch of
food and drive across the border and go
give them like some I don't know give
them some C batteries or something so
that they can uh use flashlights and and
get you I don't even know give them like
borrow their phones and fully charge
their phones for them or something like
that instead I was like uh whoa that
sucks I don't know how we would deal
with that and then the food came out and
we went this is pretty good
you know it's like
I'm not saying you shouldn't care about
other people but like the second you
hear like oh someone had a C-section
you're like stop everything we need to
immediately listen we would love for
that if somebody came over after Kate
had her C-section and was like here's a
bunch of like home-cooked food
that would have been amazing but uh you
know anybody who didn't do it I'm not
like what an [ __ ] I'm like you got
your own [ __ ] going on
we made the baby what do you expect
is in a C-section less painful well it's
like I mean maybe I'm part of the
problem for speaking on it but
it's the recovery is a lot worse
the you know because you're getting that
they're slicing through lots of layers
of tissue
so you're like it's hard to walk and you
know your core is all messed up and it
turns out you use your core for
absolutely everything and as with any
major surgery you know like you have
gastrointestinal issues and stuff like
that the the
regular childbirth is like
tends to be substantially
more like
drawn out and painful in the moment
but the C-section also was like there
was no like drive to the hospital skirt
skirt skirt we would so the doctor we
need a doctor right now it was literally
like hey uh our appointment's at 11 it's
uh 9 45 we should really get a move on
and then we just oh man you know what oh
well let's park here I'm we could drive
around for another 20 minutes trying to
find a closer parking spot let's just
get out here and and you can push me you
know
and then we like went in
I just remember the the nurse being so
mad at me because like I we had it was
mask mandated in the hospital
and I kept like adjusting my mask I
don't know what I would consider a
normal amount like once every 15 minutes
and she was like I'm gonna give you a
new mask just so you know as soon as you
touch your mask your mask is useless and
I was like I
we're having a baby in like you know
half an hour like I get that this is
annoying you or whatever I don't even
know if that [ __ ] is true but I know
you're you're in charge of the situation
so
anyway
that's that's all I remember about
our appointment
isn't it always touching you
touching touching me yeah we're touching
you
yeah and then they pulled the baby out
of my wife's abdomen and then the nurse
was like but you put a mask on that baby
good dude sweet put a mask on that baby
she was no they didn't make the baby
wear a mask
if we'd had the baby like two months
earlier they probably would add Woulda
but
I still I forget who I was talking about
it with but I was like some of this
stuff I'm not a coveted denier in the
slightest
I've had more vaccines than I'm trying
to think let's just put it this way I've
had more than required
but I'm still annoyed that after we had
the baby they didn't make us use or they
didn't let us use the [ __ ] communal
fridge they were like hey just so you
know because of kovid you can't use the
fridge in here but you can order
doordash it was like I can't bring in
home-cooked food and put it in the in
the fridge because I might have cooked
up a nice batch of kovid the infect the
whole Ward but I can get doordash to the
hospital
from a driver who's interacted with like
900 patrons that day and driven around
in his car with the windows up and then
like just bring the bag into the
restaurant anyway
it's this I'm just I'm just saying okay
that's the stool sample fridge oh good
then it's not just me
well I think we know this one is like
so this one's pretty simple let's put it
that way
oh thank heavens for modern medicine
that we can get healthy babies here even
if it means from a C-section that will
be your first comment you're not invited
to the damn barbecue
hey my wife's friend just had a
C-section thank heavens for modern
medicine that we can get healthy babies
home even if it means a C-section
that's that's a robot's kind that's like
a chat gpt3 Android comment like that's
why I even be part of the conversation
at that that point you know like the the
fun of a social engagement is not
necessarily just whenever someone says
something to you thinking of the most
socially respectable way to reply
you can have a little bit of fun with
the conversation you know you don't have
to get naughty with it but you just
don't have to be saying like ridiculous
stuff
like yeah everybody's thanking they're
thankful for modern well not everybody
but most people are thankful for modern
medicine
don't need to say that
you see if I was at a a situation and uh
someone said to me hey my wife's friend
just had a C-section I would say oh
best of luck my wife had a C-section too
I know what the recovery is like I
wouldn't say thank you uh careless
Linnaeus for inventing uh I don't even
know the medicine involved in the
process
every day I get down on my knees and I
genuflect that in
1906 Dr Jonas Salk invented the process
known as the Caesarean section were it
not for that so many complications would
have like you of course you I mean it's
one of those things this sounds maybe
ungrateful but in a social situation you
should take it for granted
wow oh these jalapeno poppers are
amazing yeah isn't it a Wonder of modern
agricultural practices that we're able
to get deep fried jalapeno peppers north
of the 48th parallel in January though
it's [ __ ] just oh spicy that's like
learn to talk like a human being a
little bit before you give advice about
what this guy did wrong everybody knows
he did it wrong but you'd like don't get
how to do it right
or even make a joke about the movie
Alien
that's what's the joke
I like okay so there's chess burst
there's an alien or uh Shaw gives
herself a C-section with the the Auto
Doctor in Prometheus hey a C-section
that reminds me of my favorite movie
Prometheus
it's just weird also you can't just say
or make a joke about like what's the
joke
George Carlin
well if you if it's so easy to do off
the cuff why don't you do it right now
instead of just saying just make a joke
about it
if it's if it's that simple
an alien joke would have had me in
stitches
LOL or ripping out my stitches
I can't remember if Laughing hurt after
my c-section I do remember getting out
of bed wrong one night that sharp pain
is burned in my memory okay I mean I
believe that
holy cow
Ridley Scott should put a
I'm not gonna go there you know how like
in the alien and aliens and Alien 3 and
Alien Resurrection they had like the
chest burster
and then in like alien Covenant they had
the back burster
Ridley Scott should in the next alien
movie that he pretends is in an alien
movie they should make an ass burster
like Danny McBride should be like no
guys no I feel good I feel good I feel
the fence
oh oh my ass my ass
oh man
does that happen in um in dreamcatcher
doesn't one of the guys poop out an
alien into the toilet and then he like
closes the lid on it and he's trying to
keep it from what a shitty movie man
holy cow
is Jason Lee
oh man no the alien shits him out and
he's trapped under the he's under the
seed that's a Nightmare Man
you're the [ __ ] for the joke you're
the [ __ ] for thinking it's normal
you're the [ __ ] for calling listen
you're of course you're right
yeah you're I mean you're not you're not
even not wrong you're actually just
right
I do hate that this guy is like he
deserves a lot of heat but he's getting
so much heat for like
the patriarchy and I'm like this he's
just one guy he's probably like 24 years
old or something like that
this guy what didn't invent you know
obstetrician surgical practices he's
just he's a loser got him some slacks
they're like you're the reason the
husband's Stitch was invented I'm like
what are you [ __ ] mean he was
probably like negative 92 when that [ __ ]
was invented how could he be the reason
he's he's literally just an idiot
he's not the reason for
the problems in society if anything the
problems in society are the reason for
him
anyway
like he's he's both a victim and the
perpetrator of society's ills
am I the [ __ ] for getting into a
dispute with the daycare staff over my
child's nap schedule
I don't know we'll see here's my in in
principle the way I choose to think
about my daycare situation is
um when they look after the kids as long
as the kids are you know getting
attention and safe and they're getting
food and a nap whatever the [ __ ] the
daycare does to make that happen is none
of my business quite frankly
I'm not going to be too paranoid over
oh she prefers like almond milk to cow's
milk or something like that if if you
put it in a cup and she drinks it and
she smiles then that's fine with me as
long as it's not you know like
Pepsi or or God forbid RC Cola or
something but
because like I I know how hard it is to
look after like one kid if you're
looking after like you know six kids or
like 26 kids or like a hundred kids with
five other people or something like that
I'm sure you gotta do what you gotta do
it's not all about me right uh well
anyway let's do the post
background info I'm a working parent who
values the importance of a consistent
sleep schedule for my child okay me too
uh but I should not get stun locked yet
you're in if you're in charge of waking
them up the same time every day you're
in charge of putting them to bed the
same time every day the nap is it's a
floating point which I understand is not
the you know data type definition of
what a a floating point is but like if
you want to be in charge of the exact
nap time then then don't put them under
another stranger's care during the day
five days a week
I've always been specific with daycare
staff about my child's nap schedule and
needs and it's important for her health
and happiness to have a consistent
routine I would agree with that within
reason my child let's call her Emma has
been attending the same daycare for a
few months now I noticed her nap
schedule is being disrupted and I
couldn't figure out why I suspected the
daycare staff were not following my
instructions properly I decided to set
up a meeting with the daycare director
to discuss my concerns during the
meeting I found out the staff were not
adhering to Emma's nap schedule and
instead trying to make all the children
nap at the same time regardless of their
individual needs I was Furious and
expressed my disappointment in the
staff's lack of attention to my child's
needs
yeah you're the [ __ ] like for sure
you ever notice like when you get on an
airplane and there's 400 people on the
airplane there's like three different
meals
do you want you know
the
meal that's emblematic of this airline's
home country or are you a picky eater
who only eats uh fried fish and french
fries or are you kosher vegetarian Halal
that's it like that's all they got
sometimes you're like I want the
vegetarian meal they're like here's a
fruit cup okay like it's when you got
400 people not everybody gets to be like
and can I can you take the peanuts out
of the peanut sauce I really like a
peanut sauce but I prefer it with like
slightly less peanuts like you can't
when you're dealing with a lot of people
not everybody gets to have their exact
way you do things in bulk you have a
compromise if your kid ate breakfast at
like 10 a.m and there's 90 kids who eat
breakfast at 9 00 A.M
that's not the way that it's going to
work you're going to like you you need a
private nanny in order to get that
situation to come to pass it's like
being on the bus and being like hey
could you stop right here no the bus
stops where it stops because everybody's
got to get where they need to go if you
want to stop at a specific place you got
to get a taxi
now the daycare staff are mad at me and
the director thinks I'm overreacting I
feel that my child's well-being and
development are being compromised I'm
not being heard now the daycare staff
are expecting an apology did I go too
far here yeah
I mean that's I mean there's nothing
more to say honestly
hey your neighbor's cat thanks for the
gifted subscriptions thank you
I mean I feel like
there's there's just some there's some
idiocy here and like I don't want to say
narcissism but let's call it
self-centeredness I understand the idea
that like you know you probably had your
kid at home for a year and you're like
okay they wake up at 7 30 they take they
eat lunch at 11 45 they take their nap
at 12 30 I wake them up at 1 30 because
like you you got that [ __ ] unlocked but
now like
you gotta recognize that you you have to
slowly Release Control
you just ignoring the fact that I think
it's unreasonable to ask for this level
of individual care like it is reasonable
to be like my child is allergic to Dairy
so if you're cooking a meal with dairy
then can you just make them like a
peanut butter sandwich instead that's
that seems very reasonable to me but
like everybody getting their own
specific nap time is ridiculous also
like if if there's even if there's like
five kids at the daycare how is one kid
supposed to go down for their nap
and then like four kids are going ape
[ __ ]
and then like that one kid is gonna wake
up and then four kids are gonna be
napping
also sucks for the the daycare that you
got like this rolling nap schedule like
I'm sure that it's great for the I get
that you're paying them don't get me
wrong but like to have your like the
kids that you're looking after all go to
sleep so you can have like half an hour
to an hour to eat lunch and probably
like clean up a little bit that's
probably very helpful to have in the
middle of the day assuming you want a
clean daycare and like a daycare
provider who's not strung to the well I
guess just too high strong like it's
just crazy you get everybody's gotta
compromise and and go together here
it's just too much man you're the
[ __ ] surely you were given
information about the nap schedule they
do one nap for all and families have to
just accept and here's the other thing
it doesn't matter
like why does it matter as long as your
kid and I'm not trying to parents plain
but like we have days where like she
goes down for a nap it's just because
the the baby Works around our schedule
essentially like we work a little bit
it's not like we're gonna stay out till
2 A.M or something like that but like if
we got something that has to be done
from 12 to 2 and she can't nap well then
she's taking her nap at 2 30. and if she
takes her nap at at four to five instead
of one to two
maybe she'll be a little cranky later
that day but she goes to bed at the same
time and you wake him up at the same
time like it's okay it's life
not gonna hit the same beats absolutely
every single day that's just crazy
I mean I just I don't understand
it just seemed and also I like
you should be
like obviously concerned about your
child's well-being but you should also
like trust your daycare provider like
I'm sure there's [ __ ] that's happened to
the daycare that like if I was there I
probably would have been horrified I'm
sure some kids have tripped on the rug
and smashed their head on the floor or
you know accidentally tried to like eat
a piece of Lego or something like that
and the daycare providers smacked it out
of their hand at the last minute
what I don't know
doesn't hurt me
I don't want to hear about all the
near-death experiences that happened at
the daycare I want to how was the how
did you eat today she ate well how was
her poop her poop was good okay see you
tomorrow thank you so much for your
service right like
you don't need to you don't need to
worry about it so much let them handle
it that's their job and then like you'll
be okay
you're the [ __ ] if you have a very
strict nap schedule then hire a nanny
who will follow it but like the other
thing I guess is like why is your nap
schedule so strict
and you can't say kids need a strict nap
schedule because like
I got one and she like
doesn't
she's okay
how much could it even be off by like an
hour or two hours
foreign
just weird
I can't imagine
caring so much
like let your kid just be like a little
kid
I can't believe this is real why okay
yep
fair enough
you're the [ __ ] your child is going
to be on the same schedule as everyone
else of the daycare okay does anybody
have anything insane though
any insanity
apparently not
you're the [ __ ] you're the [ __ ]
info how far off the schedule is it you
know how long how long a day is how far
off the schedule could it be
this daycare might be open like eight to
four you think they're doing the nap at
3 30 or like 8 30. come on like use your
brain
you're the [ __ ] I'm about to die
laughing yeah honestly like your daycare
probably hates you no disrespect
you should just know that with no
emotion attached to it they're probably
like this this [ __ ] again here we go
am I the [ __ ] for not driving my wife
to our son's wedding since I'm not
invited
you know what I realized there's there's
two kinds of guys with a lot of overlap
in the middle there's house guys and Car
Guys
there's my house my rules but then
there's also like if I'm not happy with
you I'm gonna use my car as a as a point
of Leverage to extract Revenge the the
guy who drove home from the restaurant
without his girlfriend hey you can't
offend me because I'm your ride
how would you like it if I abandon you
here
never in my life have I
had a disagreement with someone and I
was like well I'm Gonna Leave You here
in an unsafe situation because you hurt
my feelings how do you feel about that
I have oh well fair enough
but I think my family is just kind of
like normal
anyway I haven't even read the post yet
I've already formed my verdict I haven't
even read the post
my son had his wedding days ago we had
some past issues that affected our
relationship no we're not on speaking
terms after he decided to sell his
grandmother's home my wife's mother
instead of keeping it
I can tell you're old
because you think that
a house has sentimental value instead of
market value I'm sorry to
do this I know and I'm not saying that
there is no Nostalgia I will probably
have Nostalgia for this house because
we're raising our child in it but at the
same time like
I don't think that it makes your your
son a bad guy to sell his wife's mom's
house like how did he get possession of
the house to begin with he got it in the
in the you know will I'm assuming he
inherited it
why does he have to keep the house
forever it's not even your house it's
it's not even your wife's house it's
your wife's mom's house it's not even
her house it's his house it's not even
his house because he sold it so who
cares
he sent his mom an invitation but didn't
include me I was fine with that because
I'm I have no emotions whatsoever I
didn't try to fight back or anything I
had no interest in going to my son's
wedding but however I refused to drive
my wife to the wedding she's disabled
and cannot drive and we live three hours
away I saw I said that since I'm not
invited to the wedding nor am I taking
part in it then I shouldn't have to
drive there my wife told me I was being
unreasonable and that I was punishing
her for our son's decision but I told
her it was on her to make travel
Arrangements since she's an adult or he
could have provided proper means of
transportation for her and not assume
I'd go there when I'm not welcome we had
an argument and she ended up being taken
there by my brother she refused to speak
to me upon her return and my brother
said I was in the wrong for letting her
fend for herself when me and my car were
available yeah you're just crazy
he's an insane person what are you in
like your 60s
first off you know this post is fake
because a 60 year old man turning down a
three-hour Drive
it's like their favorite thing to do
I refuse to believe that this is a real
person
I mean that I think what I was younger I
would have been like I don't really want
to do a three-hour drive now if it's
like a Saturday or Sunday I'm like
even if I'm I would rather drive and
maybe not even go to the wedding
honestly
I'll just drive I'll listen to a couple
of podcasts it's just nice to keep your
mind occupied I'll park the car you guys
go in for a few hours I'll take a nap
and then you come out I'll drive you
home
men do be driving
I think it's also like a little crazy
that I'm assuming that this is real
why don't you care that I mean like
I'm reading between the lines which is
not fair okay
because I get mad at people for doing
the same thing
but
when you're like in you're an old man
like no disrespect and you said we had
some past issues that affected our
relationship
you need to go into further detail about
those
were you like a horrible father when he
was 0 to 18. and then you like trying to
get back into his life and he was like
no thanks or did he fall under the
Specter of drug addiction and like hock
your refrigerator and stuff like that
and it strained your relationship and
like you've refused to apologize and and
or he's refused to apologize and so on
and so forth you know what I mean
like what what happened because my
assumption based on the pettiness of the
the Boomer making the post is that like
they just had some conflict but the dad
I mean maybe again this is not
projecting this is what I would like to
think that I would do in that situation
is you as the dad just go yeah my kid
like owns me I apologize for whatever
like I'm not gonna let myself
be
taken advantage of to like a huge degree
but simultaneously it's like
you know if you want to have a
relationship with your kid you gotta
meet them on their terms
I mean the parents kind of get the raw
end of the deal to begin with
I give my daughter like a thousand times
more attention than I give my parents
and if she chooses to have kids she'll
give her children a thousand times the
attention that she gives me it's like it
it [ __ ] rolls like Downstream instead of
Upstream
anyway I just don't understand
it just doesn't seem
I mean like your son's already mad at
you why [ __ ] it up with your wife as
well it's the other there's like there's
parent
ing here but there's also like husbands
planning which is like why don't you
just like do a nice thing for your wife
like your family's already [ __ ] up now
you just made it worse way to go idiot
and I'm supposed to believe that like
you're not the problem in this situation
when you're annoying everyone else
around you
certainly seems like the common element
is
you know you're you're emotional
also don't even understand why you would
put it in the post that he decided to
sell his grandmother's home instead of
keeping it like what
like that's a whole different Post in
and of itself for like you know our
slash personal finance or something like
that do you think people are
automatically gonna he sold a house
holy cow I've never heard of that
happening before you know every house
has ever been sold as belonged to
somebody and many of those somebody's
were somebody's mother I know it's it's
hard to imagine but
your mother
I don't even need to read the comments
obviously he's the [ __ ] like this is
not even Up For Debate
I have so many questions if it was your
wife's
mother and not yours why are you so
upset about your son selling the house
what did you do is there something
you're not telling us what did you do to
upset your son or is he so petty he
didn't invite you because you said you
know I think I shouldn't sell the house
okay we we had great minds think alike
you're the [ __ ] she's right yeah I
know this puts you in bad husband
category understatement of the year
info when did you tell her you weren't
taking her to the wedding
if you usually are her sole mode of
transportation and she had no reason to
expect he wouldn't take her to the
wedding you would be the [ __ ]
I mean I honestly think he would still
be the [ __ ]
if it you told her like two weeks in
advance if you're like hey just so you
know I'm not driving you to our son's
wedding because I'm mad he didn't invite
me
okay like
be mad and do the [ __ ] you're supposed
to do anyway like welcome to society
I I get that it's not that easy but you
can like be mad and do [ __ ] anyway
at least when you recognize it's the
right thing to do you don't have to be
like I'm mad at someone else's fault
usually it's your own fault
you're the [ __ ] why would you make
your wife suffer to punish your son
or is it he doesn't want to suffer
through a six-hour drive and needing to
hang out by himself at random places
listen I'm telling you that's idyllic
you know what I would give on on some of
these road trips to drive for three
hours and then have like six hours off
the clock
that's a lunch I can eat by myself at a
restaurant of my choosing and then early
dinner I can eat by myself at a
restaurant of my choosing and then on
the way back I can listen to the radio
this sounds like a nice day and then
maybe because you had an early dinner
when you get back home
you might even be able to get like a
midnight snack or something like that
it sounds kind of nice honestly
you know what sounds exhausting is
driving three hours sitting through like
an hour-long marriage ceremony and then
going to the reception and having to
make conversation with like a bunch of
people that apparently don't really like
you that much to begin with and then you
know you're doing the dancing and you
know it's an open bar but you can't
drink because you got a long drive after
that that sounds annoying
you could catch my ass eating at like
two chain restaurants that don't exist
in my local area code
I'll be getting mod pizza for lunch I'll
be following that up with Shake Shack
for dinner
oh it's a cheat day
plus two it's just weird
not the [ __ ] I won't speak for the
mess that is your family life but you
never have to drive six hours to an
event you were specifically told not to
come to it's not six hours to the event
let's be honest it's three hours to the
event and three hours back
because if it was six hours two then it
would be 12 hours total so don't use
these little shortcuts of language don't
try to Mobius strip some language in
here try to trick my my animal brain
okay
bro driving is actually like
I know some people hate it there's times
when I don't really like it but like
it's kind of like a video game like I
don't know if anyone's ever thought of
this but every time I drive I'm like
whoa this is like almost exactly like
Euro Truck Simulator
except you never get that temptation to
just like go um Trevor mode
because it's like actually your body on
the line
whereas in Euro Truck Sim you're like ah
this is taking [ __ ] forever
I'd rather drive than be a passenger any
day of the week
absolutely
I don't know how to I'm not saying it's
right I'm just saying that's uh
that's where I'm at
that was only top today I wasn't even
looking at top this week
am I the [ __ ] for not giving my
daughter her education fund money
oh no this is such a fake post I'm sorry
it's not real this is first off it's
longer than the average college
assignment it's about how her his
daughter went into the liberal arts
instead of uh stem okay well like if
this is real
the money you put into the education
fund is not for you to choose what to do
with your education if you want to do
that you could just pay to go to school
right now Idiot
it's money for somebody else
you don't get to choose uh what major
they take just that it's it's used on uh
education to begin with and the [ __ ]
for telling her to get over herself
I got a dog



two years ago Corgi and she is very so
much very much so my sidekick I've been
with my fiance for five years my fiance
does like the dog but she's currently
pregnant and experiencing massive
migraines this has been snapping at
everything so every morning when I get
up I find my fiance already awakened at
the table relaxing as soon as I get out
of bed my dog goes nuts it's like super
energy where she's running sideways
barking up a storm jumping from the bed
to the floor a million times causing the
apartment to shake cause it's a whole as
[ __ ] you gotta move man
when the dog jumps from the apartment
the floor to the bed the whole house
shakes
this is a real problem
is she living on stilts you out in the
Outer Banks
as a corgi man
anyway I will sit there and sing made up
songs to her and just [ __ ] around with
her it's pretty noisy and I can be loud
it's just my way of interacting with my
pet I also have ADHD so I'm fully aware
I can be ridiculously loud and sometimes
I forget to tone it down my fiance has
complained about it a few times and I
will absolutely try to tone it down for
a while but as [ __ ] up as it sounds
the second she stops complaining is out
of sight out of mind I start doing it
again I catch myself I apologize
immediately but sometimes I don't even
catch myself doing it that's this
oh
so she has been getting up earlier than
normal because she says she needs peace
and quiet away from you and the dog
because she can't hear herself think
when we get up and then she starts
getting migraines or being overall
pissed off but now she is complaining
because I can sense her not in the bed
anymore probably after 20 minutes of her
being gone and her warmth no longer
there then I'm wide awake and the dog
senses it and you know so she's now
getting pissed because she thinks I'm
purposely not letting her have space and
purposely annoying her with my behaviors
I'm not truly but it seems like it I
guess I've tried just laying in bed for
a while so she can relax but I get stir
crazy and I also don't feel like I
should have to stay in bed so she can be
alone when I live there too
okay why don't you like wake up and take
the dog out
for like a little bit
I don't understand the problem
yeah but no but yeah but yeah but yeah
yeah but yeah
but she flipped this morning I felt her
sneaking out what a [ __ ] sneaking out
of bed this morning at 5am
who does she think she is waking up
early
uh at her own discretion to get some
alone time taking her warmth that I need
subconsciously in order to be able to
sleep and I can't just wake up and look
at my phone for a little bit because I
go stir crazy
I immediately need to wake up and start
singing made up songs to my dog
I watched her sit at the table with her
book well the Dog Saw me awake and
immediately goes ballistic Jumping on
the Bed whining barking she comes in and
says well you guys calm down so I can
have time to myself for once I just
side-eyed her because I'm getting pissed
at this point with her demands she says
well I tell her to get over herself and
just because she's pregnant doesn't mean
I have to change who I am
oh no oh no no no no no oh no
oh he actually believes that oh no
oh
sorry uh or or change how that household
works of course it's Gonna Change how
the household works you [ __ ] idiot
are you crazy
I mean like you're gonna be introducing
a baby into this issue I'm not saying it
has to change in this specific way but
that's Madness is anybody in history
ever said yeah we're having a baby but
that's not going to change anything
obviously it's gonna change something
you're living with a [ __ ] baby
are you crazy
it's like the most wrong thing you could
say there like it's just factually
nonsensical
she immediately left after telling me to
go [ __ ] myself and won't answer my calls
she's been gone for six hours am I the
[ __ ] yeah but like
I I mean like
you gotta give her some alone time
it's not even like
it's so easy I guess to just be like
she's carrying your child she's got a
lot of she's got a hormonal cocktail
that's like a roulette table every damn
day some days it's like she's never
loved you more someday she's like get
out of my face the smell of you makes me
want to throw up okay so she's going
through a lot but also there's like just
a level of like human
I don't want to say decency but maybe
this is the right word it's like she's
if this assuming this post is real which
I hate to say that I actually believe
that it is
she's doing everything that she can do
to get some alone time you got to get
the [ __ ] out of the house like a little
bit
even if you don't want to like you you
got to because there's no other option
she's gonna go crazy
like it okay how about 5 a.m is a little
early okay
I'll admit but maybe she's waking up at
5am because she wants some alone time
maybe she could get up at 6am you could
get up with her and you could take the
dog for a walk
that sounds nice a nice brisk morning
walk with with your best friend
I I you probably don't want to be
outside for like two hours I'm sure you
got other stuff going on at the same
time but like you know at least give her
like a little bit of time
just in general you shouldn't until you
have the kid you shouldn't be waking up
at 5am to have some solo time like
that's to to have gone to that measure
to begin with is crazy
the fact that she did that rather than
tell you to [ __ ] off earlier like makes
her a bit of a saint honestly
yeah
it's just it I don't know I just don't
understand
I don't want to say like why do you hate
your fiance so much but it's just like
I don't know I just look like can you do
anything
it's like you've literally tried nothing
like you're you're
like here's the okay I know you could
say I could just like lay in bed for an
hour and that would be relaxing but I
get bored okay so [ __ ] like be bored
look at your phone or something I don't
know or go like train yourself to go
back to sleep it might take you a couple
of days but do it like
was like I know hey my fiance is telling
me like um she's gonna leave me if I
don't make any effort to change my
behavior But It's Tricky
it's like I can understand why like
she's extremely upset
I just hate when any post is like you
know the post is like am I the [ __ ]
for being hungry and then the top
comment is like info why won't you eat
and then the post is like I don't really
I don't feel like it you know oh you
think I haven't thought of that
all of you know I have food in their
house but none of it is really exactly
what I want right now like that's I know
you're saying why can't I just sleep a
little longer
I go I get a little stir crazy
like I know I this is the most annoying
thing to hear but like can't you just
close your eyes
like ask right now it's what it's 10 10
07 a.m if you said close your eyes for
an hour and lay down my ass would be
like no officer are you crazy
but at 5 00 am
if I woke up a little bit and then
someone was like close your eyes for an
hour I'd be like
see you in an hour see you in 59 minutes
that's the easiest time to to go back to
sleep is right when you're supposed to
be waking up
but I still think you should just wake
up at 6am and take the dog for a walk
also like no disrespect but you guys are
like [ __ ]
adding a baby into this Dynamic you got
to fix this [ __ ] like ASAP because the
first three months of having that baby
you were gonna go ape [ __ ]
like
because it's gonna is everything you've
got now but on like
Ultra hard permadeath mode
it's not like that hard to raise a a
baby I think it's just like it's
constant work but it's not like at any
point they're like quick answer like a
skill testing question you know you just
got to be like on it and accept that
you're going to be tired for a while
but like you're already [ __ ] and you
haven't even hit start game yet
like try this situation but also
she's uh recovering from the pregnancy
and she's nursing uh up to 12 times per
day including like four to five times
overnight let's let's see how much you
miss her warmth when her ass is
breastfeeding at uh 11 30 1
144 520 537 610
7 and 703 and then the baby's waking up
let's see how you see how you feel about
it then
and you're in bed like oh I had a really
rough night I can't really sleep that
well when you're breastfeeding our baby
what do you speak like you got to do
something
like you you got to handle the dog at
the very least
you're the [ __ ] this mindset is how
women get branded as nags well I don't
nobody does it have to do with anything
he's literally just the guy I mean I
went off on him but he's just a guy he
didn't call his wife a nag
he just told her to get over herself
which is probably like in the same
ballpark
op sounds like the most annoying [ __ ]
in existence yeah
yeah that's probably true
you think this morning routine is going
to be helpful once the baby's born
you're loud every single morning and not
caring about the physical distress of a
person growing a new human in her body a
new human that I'll assume is also why
would you write it like that you you
[ __ ] dick that I assume is also yours
but you seem like a bad guy so she
probably cheated on you and let the
other guy finish inside of her you don't
know anything about their situation like
you're just that's just rude at this
point okay
like you're I get the the little devil
on your shoulder wants to get the own in
there but it says more about you than it
does about op in this situation that
that's where your your head jumps to
you're the [ __ ] your noise is
literally causing your fiance okay but
you're the [ __ ] because you put the
exante goo on fiancee
that makes unless you're from Quebec or
France
that makes you the [ __ ] in this
situation I'm sorry
yeah also it's supposed to have a second
e
you lost your e where's your e with an
external circumflex
anyway get up and take your dog outside
the play also train your dog before the
baby is born it's all true why am I so
mad that I'm agreeing with Reddit I
don't know
nobody's even addressed how incredibly
rude this is to not only the GF but also
his neighbors uh well you know listen
they knew what they signed up for when
they moved into an apartment where a
single dog jumping up and down causes
the whole building to shake
anyway I think we all agree that this
guy is in the wrong here and also is
trying nothing but is all out of ideas
you're in for if this is really is
you're in for a rude awakening I'm
telling you man
because it's it's gonna get a lot harder
dude you should start running uh
am I the [ __ ] through chat gpt3
[ __ ] for criticizing how my
girlfriend takes job interviews she
basically interviews them
and I feel like she isn't taking it
seriously
by the way I don't want to get too much
into the hockey stuff this weekend
Canucks fired their coach in like the
rudest way possible but then also they
hired a new coach and two assistant
coaches when they were doing the press
conference they said assistant coach B
is always just a Zoomer a phone call
away this motherfucker's living out of
the he's he's in like a different time
zone he's our assistant coach my man's
working from home right now
I didn't know you could do that I didn't
know you could have like your your
defensive coach is going to be on like
Microsoft teams or something like that
we're screwed dude
oh he's a he's a defensive coordinator
okay and then normally people would be
like why do we care about the defensive
coordinator oh because it's Sergey
gonchar he was a really good defenseman
and the team's getting a lot of bad
press right now our defense is horrible
let's hire someone who to do a role uh
who used to be a very good defenseman
themselves that that should solve it
does he live here no no big deal anyway
I mean he's coaching the metaverse right
now
my girlfriend is at a job she can't do
remotely and we're planning to move to
another state together so she's job
hunting right now her first job
interview she had a call with a top
company whose recruiter had messaged her
on LinkedIn I was expecting her to treat
it normally but she spent an hour
grilling the company on its engineering
practices then withdrew her application
in the next few calls with company she
had she basically grilled them all and
decided against moving forward with four
of the six this is good right
I've never had the interview for like a
serious job
just jobs where basically they ask you
insane questions and then they're like
okay here's you know like a keyboard and
a broom
if you have actual qualifications you're
supposed to be choosy right you're not
just supposed to take whatever the first
job that shows interest in you is you're
supposed to
you're supposed to ask questions make
sure you know you're being fairly
compensated your job description is
appropriate maybe you're aligned with
the company Vision what's the corporate
culture like
do you guys give like uh stock
compensation or is it more the kind of
thing like after a good quarter
everybody gets a water bottle or
something like that
I told her around then I feel like she's
making a mistake being so picky she's
going to ruin her reputation in the
industry if she's going around taking
interviews and cutting off the process
entirely she said she wasn't making any
enemies hell the company she dropped
have been emailing and calling
constantly wanting to bring her in for
another interview and asking her to
reconsider if anything she was a hotter
commodity
I felt like she was probably hurting her
reputation long term even if her little
power play was working I don't think
it's a real post
I'm sorry to say I don't think it's a
real post
just something about power play
it got me it triggered my fake post
radar
she said it wasn't a power play
it was professional she didn't want to
waste anyone's time but the next
interview I overheard started a big
argument one of her final two companies
had her taking a zoom interview and she
was laughing it up with an interviewer
and he was telling her the story about
ah he and the co-workers fell off a
barge into the river working on a
project and she was just like wait they
had y'all doing that not tied off to
anything look as funny as that is that's
honestly kind of [ __ ] up they put you
all in danger like that I'm gonna have
to withdraw my application she got off
the phone and said damn people really
tell on themselves if you just listen
and smile did you hear that [ __ ] why did
she why she got such a potty mouth
she's so crass with her swear words
I got nothing against her she can say
whatever she wants it's just like you
just chill out a little bit she's just
talking like a sailor man
I could fix her
and I said I thought she ended a little
prematurely like didn't even ask if they
changed anything just ended the call I
said it felt like she was trying to
delay getting a new job was she getting
cold feet she said no this is how people
at her level interview she was serious
about the interview process she wasn't
interested in walking into a [ __ ] show
I said that was BS she was sabotaging
herself on purpose basically haranguing
the companies who wanted to hire her on
the phone and she was like why do they
keep coming back for more than like I'm
critical but I'm not wrong and they know
it we have this big fight where she
insisted that anyone who was at her
level of career interviewed by
interviewing companies to see whether
they were worth their time just as much
as the other way around and I said
that's BS she got mad that I was telling
her about her own career and said she
knew better am I the [ __ ] for arguing
with my girlfriend about her interviews
she says she's interviewed yeah I think
why are you like I don't understand we
don't need to go in the comments because
they're going to be hanging you out to
dry man but like
I don't I mean it just seems kind of
like boring it's just I don't see I
don't think that she did anything wrong
assuming this is actually real
I'm not gonna do another child free
wedding post okay because they're all
the same but this one got me good i22f
am getting married soon since my fiance
and I are child free we plan to have
alcohol at our wedding we decided to
have child a child free wedding with the
age cut off at 21. as you all know if
you have children at a wedding it's not
possible to serve alcohol
also like Get over yourself you're 22.
Child free wedding you you're the child
look in the mirror
my ass 18 trying to go to the wedding
but I can't go no
am I the [ __ ] for calling my brother
and sister-in-law rude guess for
removing the decorative pillows my wife
put in the guest room can't be a real
post no husband would be upset at
um removing decorative pill pillows from
the from the bed
that's like one of the first things you
do when you are staying in a guest room
you take off all the pillows that they
put on there to make the bed look nicer
I don't know and like I don't know why
we're buying them
there's too many pillows when I stay in
my parents place it is crazy I'm a one
pillow guy and if you're two no no
problem okay I think that's well within
the spectrum of normalcy my parents
house they do like a a body pillow but
it's like horizontal over near the
headboard and then they stack two
pillows on top of each side of the body
pillow
so now already I'd be sleeping with my
neck at like a
170 degree angle or something
and then they throw like some home sense
like decorative pillows in front of
those pillows and then the cylindrical
pillow that's like it goes I think on
your on your lumbar or something like
that
it's just too much
so the first thing you do is you strip
the body pillow you throw it on the
floor because there's no place for it
because all the chairs have pillows on
them too and then you take two of the
pillows and you throw them so you got
one pillow on each side and then you'd
throw this cylinder you roll it under
the bed or something like that it's just
it's just too much
five five pillows minimum you're crazy
man I'm a one pillow guy it seems
perfect
I mean I only have one head
yes
two is for sitting up well we got at
this where we got chairs for
that we got chairs sofas bar stools beds
toilets like there's too much [ __ ] to
sit on
four pillows Jeremy
uh I'll I'll say it every time
is zero pillows psycho mode well it's a
little crazy but like my kid doesn't
sleep with a pillow we have it in the
crib but she's just like
she's laying flat
have you ever slept in zero g what the
hell are you are you asking me if I've
ever been to outer space
for for like a long enough to actually
sleep what kind of question is that is
crazy
have I ever slept on the Superman Man of
Steel roller coaster in a zero g
position what does that mean what does
that mean
zero g position
just answer the question I don't know
what it means
one pillow's the same Vibe as no
mattress cover is I assure you is not
I mean no mattress cover is is
degenerate
College style like mattress on the floor
no mattress cover
that [ __ ] is disgusting now I did it for
like three years but that's gross
there's another like one pillow it's not
like oh I'm too lazy to get more pillows
I'm like this [ __ ] is like the the
height of comfort for me
three pillows side sleeper one for my
head one to put between my knees and one
to hold on to
listen that's
you got you do you okay it's
I guess I'm more of a low maintenance
sleeper than I thought if I have one and
I'll tell you another thing this will
blow your mind
we also just run one duvet
we got like so is box spring the bed
frame
mattress
top sheet on the mattress like a fitted
sheet
duvet with the duvet cover on top of it
one pillow for me one pillow for Kate
that's it
it's nice
no sheet okay you got to be careful you
say no sheets that's like a stripped
mattress we have no sheet in the sense
that we don't have like one Thin little
blanket that you get under and then you
go oh that's not nearly enough warmth
and then you put the duvet on top and
you go oh that's too warm and then you
just sort of like
leave one toe outside ooh but I can't
what if a Monster eats my foot pull it
back in
just one duvet we're we're low
maintenance
living that Marie condo life
I think the sheet is probably the most
overrated of all the the blankets in my
opinion the duvet is a must-have
nothing triggers my anxiety like the
default iPhone ringtone
I feel like I'm in a movie commercial or
a movie trailer like
I'm about to watch Aaron Eckhart answer
a Bluetooth headset while he's driving
dude
anyway
um
yeah am I the [ __ ] for calling my
brother and sister-in-law rude guests
for removing the decorative pillows my
wife put in the guest room uh right here
my brother and sister-in-law moved in
temporarily they're staying in the guest
room as is appropriate so far we've been
on the same page concerning all things
except the decorative pillows let me
stomp you right there
then you're on the same page with
respect to everything
assuming that you're going to agree with
everybody on absolutely everything is a
Fool's Gamble
what you do is you you have a copacetic
living Arrangement when they go home
they're going to be like and oh my God
all these [ __ ] pillows what were they
thinking with all those pillows and then
when they go home you're gonna be like
and I can't believe like it was a little
much for them to just throw those nice
pillows on the ground right like you
just you
when you're together it's 99.999
copacetic and then when you leave you
talk a little bit of smack about that
that one thing and then that's what
that's the release valve that then
allows you to get together and and have
fun later in my opinion at least
my wife loves adding decorative pillows
on beds and she did the same in the
guest bedroom she did it to make the
room look better and also it's her
preference
she came to me complaining about seeing
the decorative pillows in the guest room
being put on the floor and not being put
on the bed during the day I went to I'm
sorry I'm not reading this
it's just not worth it it's not worth
the time quite frankly too boring
probably made up nobody cares
if you you you're my diagnosis is you
have to get a life who cares you care
you care more about your pillows than
you do about another human being as a
part of your family
now this one was was specifically
requested
I think there's a lot of meat on this
one I like it
am I the [ __ ] for not making extra
pancakes for my niece
I woke up at 5 a.m craving pancakes
while on vacation with my in-laws so I
decided to quickly make myself and my
son some since we were the only ones
awake besides my husband who doesn't eat
pancakes I do want to say there's a
little sub but you are the [ __ ] here
I don't know what time your in-laws wake
up if we had people over and they were
sleeping in our guest room and they
started clanging around stainless steel
bowls at 5am
I would I mean I wouldn't kick them out
but I would be like you couldn't there's
like when you have kids I feel like six
six thirty is like a reasonable time to
be like
morning five is still way before the
realm of like
being able to make noise five is wake up
look at your phone if you can't go back
to sleep you can't be up at five a.m
clanging around with like a whisk in a
bowl and then getting making good smells
and stuff like that
I mean 6 30 is early don't get me wrong
but like sometimes if you got little
kids then they're up what are you gonna
do
do you like talking to your 18 month old
go back to sleep
go get the [ __ ] back to excuse me you
stop crying it's rude it's rude to cry
like you can't there's nothing you could
really do at some point
so I think if you like if I if we
invited someone over and they stayed
overnight and they had like a
two-year-old their two-year-old got up
at six I would be like what are you
gonna do
but I would definitely lock my door
because I don't want them getting their
hands stuck in the flywheel of the
Peloton on my 45-minute Samuel classic
rock ride
would be like a scene from Wild Wild
West
foreign
because I don't want to have to pause
because if you pause they delegitimize
your leaderboard position they still
have your output stats and stuff like
that but instead of ranking you on the
leaderboard they give you a little Dash
because they're like I know you had to
pause
you could have been pausing to go get
some glycogen or something like that it
wouldn't be fair to the other people on
the leaderboard
anyway so I'm just saying it's a little
early it's a little at 5am cooking is a
little early at someone else's house you
can do whatever you want in your own
house okay
my sister-in-law's daughter
that is your niece yes came downstairs
just as my son I just don't know why you
wouldn't say nice there
because she is your niece it doesn't
matter whether she's your sister-in-law
or your sister but regardless
um she came downstairs just as my son
was finishing up and started crying
because there were no more pancakes for
her I did try to comfort her but I have
really bad morning sickness after I eat
and was starting to feel sick so I had
to take her to her parents who were
still sleeping long story short my
sister-in-law was upset I only made
pancakes for myself and my son when
there were others in the house who
needed to eat breakfast she said I was
selfish and I should have known my niece
would have wanted some too so I could
have made extra just in case am I the
[ __ ] so originally
when I looked at this I said of course
they're the [ __ ]
you don't really make pancakes for two
that's one of those things it's like uh
you make like a a big bowl of the batter
and then you just cook them until
there's no batter left so I thought this
was like cut and dry there the [ __ ]
but then someone on on the subreddit
made a good point which is like they're
cooking this breakfast at 5am how do
they know that uh
you know a kid's gonna wake up at at 5
45 or 6 or 8 or 11. so like you can't
just pre-make the pancakes and then
throw them in the microwave they're
gonna be horrible you know that's not
what you want when you're craving
pancakes what they should have done for
sure
is you make the batter and make a lot
extra depending on how many people are
there
you cover it with plastic wrap you put
the batter in the fridge and then you do
the when the next group of people wake
up you put the pancake batter on The
Griddle and you make them some fresh
pancakes that's the way it should have
gone down
I don't think it makes them an [ __ ]
for only making pancakes for themselves
and their child at 5am
if it was 9 A.M and like everybody was
awake
and they said no I'm just making
pancakes for me and my child like that's
extreme [ __ ] for sure
but also I I forgot about the
contingency of uh
they're pregnant and maybe just had like
a pregnancy craving doesn't mean you're
not the [ __ ] but you know you get a
little lighter in the sentencing a
little bit
regardless I don't think I don't think
they're a bad person I think it was
maybe a little
a little thoughtless but you know if
there was ever a time to prioritize your
own interests over someone else's is
probably when you're pregnant
she could have kept the batter in the
fridge though
that's what I would say
how old was Denise dude what if it's the
mom from Jay Willis who starts crying
when she gets uh sourdough bread instead
of a hamburger bun
it's just it's really hard right now
because you wake up and you smell the
pancakes and you and you hear that
delicious Sizzle and then when you come
down there's no pancakes
she did wake the parents up for well you
say for no reason
I don't know like again maybe this is
too too far people may not agree but I
feel like if your kid
wakes up when you're still asleep and
then causes a scene
that's your responsibility I'm not
saying there's something that there's
not something that the op could have
done to placate the situation
but like if your kid is starting to cry
then that's your that's your
responsibility that's your alarm clock I
don't think you get to play the like oh
I was sleeping card
it would have been nice if like imagine
if if my kid woke up an hour before me
and then I like went into their room and
they like weren't in there I'd be like
oh [ __ ] and then I went downstairs and
she was eating some fresh pancakes that
my sister-in-law cooked for her I'd be
like whoa thank you for the solid that's
incredible
but if I heard my kid crying
and then
like she woke me up and I was like you
[ __ ] I was still asleep I'd be like
well that's can't really be like that is
your kid when your kid wakes up you're
at least at a certain age you're waking
up
foreign
you're the [ __ ] my question is how
did you manage to only make pancakes for
two people whenever I make them I can
easily feed six kids edit forgot a
verdict okay I mean again this is I
think that's a reasonable take but
simultaneously I do need to say that
it's it's a timing based thing if this
happened at at 8am I think it's a
different verdict than if it happened at
5am
not the [ __ ] I'm shocked another
mother got upset at a pregnant mom who
got up made pancakes for her and those
that were awake at the time and then got
too sick with morning sickness to make
thank you
I think that's where I've come down I'm
not the [ __ ] and not even everybody
sucks here I think this is almost like a
nobody sucks here
in this situation I one would make a
large I love this is a Bicentennial Man
giving his verdict in this situation one
would make a large batch of batter
knowing others will want some as they
get up I can't imagine not doing this
I don't know if I'm just a little weird
but like
if I went maybe I have no self-esteem if
I went to my in-laws place
and they cooked waffles for everybody
else and they said oh Ryan sorry we're
out of waffle batter here's a granola
bar I'd be like [ __ ] sick granola bar
thank you so much
there's other Alternatives I could have
been starving you could have let me
starve to death or something
I'm definitely not the kind of person
where like if
someone is if like one person is like
can I have a waffle then all of a sudden
I'm like well if if my niece gets a
waffle then I'm getting a waffle too
you're not a little kid
true
you got me with that one
so you hate pancakes then that's a whole
new sentence
like I'm I'm very much not a believer in
the
did you bring enough for the rest of the
class that's [ __ ] crazy anytime I'm
hungry
if I want to eat I have to bring 30
snacks
if you want me to bring enough for the
rest of the class they should make the
classes like six times smaller that's
crazy how about
you you don't even worry about what
other people are eating you eat when you
want to eat and then when other people
are eating you don't feel like you're
entitled to have exactly the same food
as them
this [ __ ] is just weird
one person in class was eating an Oreo
why are we normalizing the idea that you
should be able to have the food that
everybody else that one other person is
having
maybe one person in class is you know
didn't need breakfast or something like
that they gotta eat a Nature Valley
granola bar they shouldn't have to
provide 30 Nature Valley Valley granola
bars everybody else had some Captain
Crunch for breakfast they can keep their
eyes on the damn chalkboard
that being said I don't think kids
should be allowed to go to the bathroom
whenever they want I think they will
take advantage of it in school at home
whatever that's the parents decision I
think your ability your bathroom
privileges should be tied to your GPA if
you got a 4.0 you can go to the bathroom
whenever you choose I don't think you're
going to jeopardize your education just
to [ __ ] off
if you got like a three
you can go to the bathroom
no questions asked once a day but as
soon as you use your once a day bathroom
pass you have to ask the next time it
doesn't mean you can't go it just means
the next time you had you're a really
two bathroom trips
okay have you got a 2.0 you gotta ask
every time I'm sorry
now the teacher can use their discretion
maybe they have a 2.0 for things that
are outside of their control like IBS
maybe they have a 2.0 because they're
doing dumb [ __ ] like oh I'm bored with
this class I'm gonna go you know like
smoke a cigarette they are in the boy's
bathroom or something like that in which
case
you got to leave it up to the teacher's
discretion sometimes they might say go
ahead just because they're sick of
looking at you
what about 1.0 I didn't even know that
that was a that was I thought two was as
low as it goes
what is a one like a
wait can you have under a one then
is a zero uh like you average a D minus
f is zero I thought F would be in the
negatives
we didn't really do GPA in in Canada too
much in University we did but in high
school we didn't we just averaged our
grades
rather than coming up with some kind of
quarterback rating composite that
doesn't make inherent sense
GPA is averaging your grades oh so you
got like a four
in 11th grade English class you got a
four
no you didn't you got [ __ ] like a 97
or something like that four is an a
why don't you just use the number this
is Celsius Fahrenheit [ __ ] again people
are like it just makes sense it's not
because I learned it and grew up using
it like you sure you could use like the
real number but it just makes more sense
to like convert the letter grade into a
number first
it's the average of the letters
the hell are you talking about
don't they
when you get like a chemistry test
your teacher doesn't look at the test
and go this feels like an A and then
puts an A on it they [ __ ] go there's
a hundred questions they got 91 of them
right here's an a
with a 91 written next to it why don't
you just say like my GPA is 91.
they legit do write a number
yeah but not I know they write like a
zero to a four I'm just saying
why convert the number which was the
percentage of the test that you got
right to a letter and then convert that
letter back to another number
because it makes sense I got a 96 which
is an a which converts to a 4.
no you didn't you got a 96.
just it's just weird to me
before because before computers it would
be annoying to do the math for 400 kids
bro they're the ones doing the math
if it's annoying to look at the grades
that 400 [ __ ] kids got is way more
annoying to take those 400 [ __ ]
grades and every time they get a grade
on something converted to a letter and
then convert it to a [ __ ] number
it doesn't make sense why don't you just
use them
Fahrenheit makes more sense because like
zero is like cold and 100 is like hot
Celsius is like whoa I don't even know
what I'm looking at
whoa what's hot
30 weird I don't think I could get used
to that in [ __ ] half a second
doesn't make any damn sense
water freezes at zero and boils at a
hundred
[ __ ] I'm not a glass of water I'm a guy
I'm a man I'm 40. I know how to use
decimal points
Fahrenheit has more resolutions
what the hell are you that's such a Dan
comment
Fahrenheit has higher resolution anyway
there's pancakes I think we set our
piece on the pancake one there's Nuance
there
some nuance
would I be the [ __ ] for suing my
d-i-l what the hell is that
that in law
daughter-in-law makes way more sense
oh I've never seen it like that
oh no am I the [ __ ] for forgetting to
lock the door a few times a month
by the [ __ ] for leaving the stove on
when I leave the house now and then
foreign
like they're saying like [ __ ] up [ __ ]
like oh you could have like burned down
our whole [ __ ] house with us inside
of it but like I didn't do that I just
left the stove on I feel like I'm being
unnecessarily maligned here
I read it boy I was hoping they never
have an issue to put here but I really
need some perspective on this one I come
from a family that only sometimes locked
our doors so it was never really
ingraining me to keep the door locked at
all times my wife on the other hand came
from a family where the norm was to lock
everything get a camera so it's always a
value judgment isn't it it's always like
I don't need to do that because that
would mean that I am expressing a
precaution and expressing a precaution
means that I'm afraid and I vowed never
to be afraid of anything even of [ __ ]
that's scary and can be mitigated by
just going click
I'm not living my life in fear I just
choose not to be afraid of the other
stuff that other people get out in front
of with a modicum of
I don't know you get the idea
they're paranoid though my ass when I'm
paranoid
that's me locking the door
my ass when I'm Paralyzed by fear
and hold on I forgot it listen I don't
want to be disingenuous I forgot about
this part
that's where you check the handle to
make sure you actually locked it
just hyper concerned about safety in all
ways as a result in the beginning of our
relationship I rarely locked our doors
and she always did it gave her a lot of
anxiety especially because we're living
in a rough neighborhood at the time
since then I've done my best to keep up
with locking the doors we have since
moved to a great apartment in a very
safe neighborhood and although I'm a
forgetful person I have been remembering
I lock our door
eight to nine times out of ten still
working on it though
it immediately seems like you you're not
really working on it
it seems like you want it to be fixed
but you don't wanna because you're you
didn't buy into the mission statement
which is that it's just a good thing to
lock your door
so that like
if you get robbed You're like at least I
did what I could
like if I didn't lock my door
and then I maybe it's not like legally
fair to say this if I left my house
didn't lock my door and came back and
all my [ __ ] was gone I would be like
yeah
my fault at least in some way that's my
fault
what was I expecting if I locked it and
I came back and all my [ __ ] was stolen
I'd be like I am a victim of a crime I
have been targeted by a cat burglar I
have been burgled
there is a heist here if I didn't lock
my door I'd be like
well if I really liked that TV I would
have taken a I would have taken the
extra second
I'm not saying it means you should be
robbed I'm simply saying that it's like
you could have you could have done more
to stop it you could have done literally
the bare minimum
this victim blaming
Giga chat yes
like sometimes the victim needs a little
bit of the blame
not in all situations but the idea that
you should never pass any blame to a
victim is crazy
if my ass gets like insanely drunk and
then goes driving and crashes into like
a telephone pole and dies
I'll be like well
maybe maybe you shouldn't have been
drunk driving
can't blame the victim who put the
telephone pole there they should make
telephone poles that have a breakable
bottom and then a sturdy tops so that in
this situation it should you aren't the
victim in that situation I'd be dead
the telephone pole was the victim
all the people who lose uh internet
access as a result
anyway
the point is he hasn't been robbed yet
I don't understand I know we go through
this once a month why don't
why do people not lock their doors
when like they spend so much time
justifying not doing a task that takes
less than one second they say insane
stuff like it adds up it literally
doesn't they're pennies they're gone
they're gone you can't it takes more
time to aggregate the time saved than it
does to do the thing that would cost you
the time in the first place it's like
saying you know I never put on my seat
belt when I drive my car because it
takes two seconds to click it into the
latch like
and you know what don't even start with
me what is it with taxis when you get in
them why is the the the latch always the
wrong way
you're always trying to put the seat
belt into the latch and you're like it's
not going in right then you got to reach
in between the damn seat cushions pull
it out flip it 180 and and
doesn't make any damn sense
anyway
I just forget that's fine like if you
forget to do something I can't be like
that mad at you it's more like if you
forget to do it and then I'm like can
you please lock the door and you're like
well I don't live my life in fear I'd be
like well okay then [ __ ]
I don't know go jump off a bridge or
something then Brave guy
why is it why do you are you only Brave
when it comes to being lazy
why is it never like I'm brave I'm gonna
go out and be like a volunteer
firefighter because I'm not afraid of
danger it's always some [ __ ] that's like
I'm not gonna look at the new food
pyramid because everything kills you
anyway
it's always like to justify a behavior
that you already enjoy instead of to
justify actually doing something Noble
like the Canadian I don't know it was a
university they did like a meta study of
the harmful effects of alcohol and they
said no amount of alcohol in any
quantity is safe if you want to be as
safe as possible a maximum of two drinks
a week
people who have never even left their
Hometown were like two drinks come on
science
could you at least made it something
that was reasonable and you're like
that's the science man I don't know what
to tell you like
it's not like they were like we hate
people who drink let's make this number
really small instead they were like you
know
here's the number and people are like
yeah and then in 1971 you told me eggs
were bad for me and then in 1978 you
told me eggs are good for me so like you
think I'm gonna believe that
foreign
you can like know it's poison and still
drink it anyway you could look at that
news and say like damn that sucks and
then like modify your behavior or not
modify your behavior
you don't have to be like oh the
scientists are wrong what do you know
about science [ __ ]
they did the [ __ ] work you're just
like that doesn't sound right to me
because it's uncomfortable to hear
anyway
I'm just saying
since then I've done my best to keep up
with locking the doors and I succeed 85
of the time unfortunately my wife's
anxiety about our safety has just been
getting worse she says she has night
terrors and can't handle worrying if the
door is locked it's awful she feels this
way and I want to help her out
that that thing is the thing is
[Laughter]
it's hard to remember sometimes
it's awful she feels this way I want to
help her out I'm just struggling to see
and understand why this situation is
provoking such an emotional response I'm
struggling to see why your ass is so
annoyed that she's annoyed that you
can't lock the door like she's got night
terrors all your ass has to do is go
like this
could you set like an alarm or I don't
know just not be looking at your phone
when you leave your house for two
seconds so you can lock the door like I
said you build a habit put like a
Post-It note next to the door or
something
get an electric lock a Smart Lock or
something
extra info my wife and I live in a newly
developed gated community on the third
floor of our apartment building in the
very back zero crimes since we've lived
here I take the dogs out every night so
I'm the one locking the door we have a
new puppy that needs to go out every
four hours and it's the 4 a.m walks when
I am most likely to forget to lock the
door listen
I'm not gonna do the thing that you're
doing which is basically being like
crime doesn't exist because you're
[ __ ] stupid like that's just wrong
you probably are
less likely to be a victim of like a
home invasion on the third floor of an
apartment building in a gated community
that makes perfect sense to me that
doesn't mean that somebody can't you
know on your floor can't have like a
psychotic episode and go around checking
all the doors find one that's open and
come into your house and [ __ ] kill
you like this [ __ ] people are going
crazy in their Apartments all the time
they don't have the threat the danger
could be coming from within the house
doesn't have to be just from outside
so regardless like you know we've lived
in situations like this not in gated
communities but either way my ass would
not sleep as well if the door was not
locked
but I mean what to be fair what I would
do is I would be like
I would be in bed and then I would be
like did I lock the door and then if I
was like I don't know if I did I would
just get up and check the door but I
understand at 4 AM that's kind of like
it's a bigger ask than than when you
just go into bed
I'm just saying yeah someone could break
into the building and then like listen
these are like infinitesimal risks don't
get me wrong
someone could hold the door open for
someone in your building that doesn't
actually live there they could get in
get in the elevator and just start
cranking on doors okay it's crazy like
it now you might be saying the risk of
that is insanely low that's true but the
cost to protect yourself at least a
little bit is even lower is literally
just going like this
that's it
also like why don't you just
lock the damn door because she asked you
to because you know you got to save some
of your energy for some battles that
actually matter
my wife has a certain way she likes me
to load this stuff into the dishwasher I
and listen I'm not trying to make this a
plebiscite on the issue
I always loaded the dishwasher like when
you load the cutlery you put the tip of
the knife down into the dishwasher so
that when you open it up you don't
accidentally like put your hand on it
and like slice your palm open okay the
forks go down the spoons go down Etc et
cetera we started living together she
told me no no no that's not the right
way the tips go up the spoon the tip of
the spoon goes up etc etc I said I don't
think that's true she said I think it is
I said you know what you're right and
it's been a solved issue ever since
because it doesn't matter at all
doesn't matter in the slightest
as we're getting a lot of she's right
she's wrong hey I do it no matter what I
win because I do it the way she told me
to
[Laughter]
actually insane I don't know
I'm just saying if it's a relatively
simple thing and you're not married to
the concept you should put your spouse's
interest ahead of yours if she is
married to the concept like if my wife
was like Hey can you lock the door I
have night terrors and I was like I
don't really feel like it I would think
that that would make me the [ __ ]
at the same boat if I was like you know
if I really needed something done a
certain way and she was like that's not
the way I do it I'd be like well it
gives me anxiety to see it done this way
I think she would be like okay
in her head she might be like this is
the stupidest [ __ ] I've ever heard in my
life but that's the that's the price you
pay
when has that happened well I'm still
waiting for the first time
I leveraged some some marriage Goodwill
today because you know what I have this
20 bill on my desk
not to brag
she came into my office and just pulled
the bill off my desk and I said whoa
what are you doing and she said you're
not using it I said yeah there's lots of
money in our bank account that's been
there for a while too that I haven't
used but that doesn't mean we're just
going to spend it
and she says seriously and I say yeah
give it back just because I got I'm just
it's just nice to have like a little
spare cash
because you never know again when the
Canadian oligopoly for
telecommunications is going to go down
and you're going to need a 20 Bill to
you know tip somebody or you know buy
lunch or something like that like it's
not it's just it's an emergency fund for
if a sun the solar flare hits the Earth
or something like that
like it's not just on my desk for
someone to come in and be like Oh twenty
dollars I'll just take it because you're
not using it immediately
I could do something with that and you
know what while I'm looking at it it's
bringing me pleasure ah twenty dollars
get a nice lunch with that for sure buy
some groceries who knows
who knows
it's just it brings me pleasure just to
see it
so you can't it's not here just to be
pilfered you know
anyway you should be able to put cash in
your Google Wallet
how would that make sense I don't know
they got smart people working there
still they should figure it out
am I the [ __ ] for putting a bag of
dog poop in a stranger's trash can
my initial hunch from the uh from the
headline is
on principle
yes you shouldn't use somebody else's
trash can for your trash in practice
does it really matter
like did something happen
like why why would you why would you
care if
someone put their garbage into your
garbage there's a little bit of their
garbage into your garbage can if it like
overflowed or spilled or something like
that it's a different story or if it was
a clean trash can and I was bringing it
in and then there was a fresh bag of dog
poop in there I'd be a little annoyed
for sure at least they're picking it up
though
I



a lovely two-year-old golden retriever
she's full of energy so she gets a lot
of walks I try to be a responsible dog
owner I always pick up her poo even if
it's nowhere near other people's homes
my wife and I brought the dog along to
visit friends in an East Coast Florida
Barrier Island Beach Community nice
quaint nothing fancy okay we walked the
dog and naturally the dog pooped my wife
had a bag picked up the poop we walked
on about four to five houses down there
was a large standard Community issued
garbage can at the end of the road the
lid was half up as it was quite full and
ready for pickup my wife deposited the
tide closed bag oh Poo into the can my
ass would do this a hundred percent
I would acknowledge is probably not the
right thing to do
but I would do it for sure
I mean I feel like it's one of those
things that's like you shouldn't do it
but who the hell cares
a man mowing his lawn at the house next
door went off he ran over yelled at my
wife you're disgusting you can't do that
why would you put your dog's waist in
someone else's can she said it is a
garbage can people put nasty things in
garbage cans that's what they're there
for he harassed her until she took it
out is my wife am I the [ __ ] here no
this person is crazy
you met a crazy person whose personality
is their neighborhood
you probably shouldn't do it to just to
be clear you did something that was very
minor you broke the social contract just
like the slightest little bit
that's it
and then this guy said no no no it's
much more important that we live in an
ordered world than a comfortable world
and he decided to make his problems your
problems you did nothing wrong
this is just a is a crazy individual
you met Batman you did you met you met
retired Batman
you're the [ __ ] I personally hate
people putting their rubbish in my bin
especially dog poop yeah but like info
[ __ ] why because it's a garbage can
you're not gonna eat out of there like
who cares
I get like you're not being taken
advantage of
I get that it's your trash can like
somebody putting their garbage in my
garbage bin
but like why would you rather okay what
you would rather they do is eat it the
second thing you would rather they do is
they pick it up and then they [ __ ]
hold on to it until they find a trash
can that's administered by the city but
unfortunately uh that doesn't exist in
the United States of America outside of
like four pockets of the country so what
are they supposed to do with it put it
in a hotel garbage can or something like
I I just I'd go buy their own house and
then their property taxes can pay for
the garbage can that then puts it like
it's it's garbage
like I would be pissed off
if I wheeled my garbage onto the end of
the road and then like somebody threw
two bags of garbage on top of my garbage
and then the garbage truck was like hey
[ __ ] you got too much Garbage I'd be
like that's not my garbage I put out the
Civic responsible amount of garbage and
now I'm being
somebody made a a full pie and I'm
catching Flack for it but if someone
just throws a little bit of dog poo in a
bag in your garbage who cares
third comment is why honestly the big
reason it gets to me is it makes the
cans we have in my city reek they're
thick plastic with heavy Lids so they
just cook in the Sun and that dog poop
garbage combo becomes Satan's potpourri
very quickly the garbage can stinks
welcome the Earth
oh the [ __ ] that already smelled
horrible smells like a little worse
it's this like
it's not like it was pleasant before and
you're like something in here stinks
you're like it's always it always stinks
it's a [ __ ] trash can is where you
put the [ __ ] that smells bad
soft you're the [ __ ] I have a dog too
so I get it I don't want to carry around
his poop it's fine to throw poop in
public dumpsters and trash cans it's
rude to throw it away in someone's
personal bin this is true but I don't
know why
like for some reason it's okay A lot of
people would consider it like more
acceptable to throw it in the dumpster
behind like a Starbucks than they would
to throw it in a closed trash bin at
somebody's house even though it's
thinking it up either way like I just
stood
I'm not saying like I'm I'm going to
stand for Starbucks I'm like it's just
one of those things where I'm like is
this feels like it's the same crime like
you need to if you need to throw it out
in a garbage bin that's like under your
own Administration or under the city's
Administration then
and so many you're right so many people
don't even pick it up man
so I know there's some of you out here
too where your dog poops on the sidewalk
you clean it up and you're like I'm a
good person then your dog poops on the
[ __ ] grass and you're like I don't
need to pick that up that's grass the
grass will take care of it yeah in like
[ __ ] six weeks when my daughter is
like I want to go run around on that
grass because it's a [ __ ] Park and
then I'm like okay I'll follow you and I
step and it's then I'm like what's that
horrible smell oh it's a leader of dog
[ __ ] that somebody just didn't pick up
because they were too busy FaceTiming
[ __ ] nobody about nothing
taking their ignored dog out for a walk
[ __ ] drives me crazy hey it's the Wessel
pigeon thanks for the gifted
subscriptions thank you
you didn't notice till well no there's
just two different stories so one time I
didn't notice until I got home and Kate
said it smells bad and I said oh no I
think I smelled and I stepped in dog
poop then like maybe six weeks ago
my daughter was running around in a
little yard in front of her daycare
and uh I was like yeah I'll chase you
and then like halfway to my car I was
like I think I stepped in dog poop and I
looked at my uh my boot and yes I did
so they just let their their dog poop
there and then
[ __ ] went wild it's not a victimless
crime it is a that is a very victim full
crime but there's no way to run like a
DNA test or something
it is disgusting
you should not touch grass but the
bloodstones are fine though because they
got that hard you know Rubber Sole
there are dog DNA tests yeah but I'm
gonna get the dog's DNA but how am I
going to match it it's not like there's
a central Repository
okay great great news we got the DNA
results of that dog poop okay it's a a t
t c a g a c c t t g g a c t t g c d c
dude
laughs
my ass is going to be like that yeah
okay I know that dog I [ __ ] know that
dog
you think I don't know those codons
curly hair
modeled fur
Jamesy soft you're the [ __ ]
you and I signed up for dealing with dog
poop but our neighbors didn't they
shouldn't have to deal with it on their
property yeah but they shouldn't know
that it happened on their property is
the other thing
like they shouldn't have a like a ring
camera on their garbage can or something
I would be a little like listen if I had
trash cans at the end of my driveway and
I was looking out the window and I saw
someone lift up the lid and throw in a
little dog poop I would be like hey Kate
you won't believe what this [ __ ] did
threw out dog poop in our own trash can
and then she would go like huh shouldn't
do that and I would be like that's what
I'm saying and then I would go on with
the rest of my day
it's like you shouldn't do it but also
like I got other stuff going on like
this it's not that big of a deal
why why care about it
I don't know it doesn't make sense to me
I would take it out and move it to my
neighbor's trash can
now we're talking you're the [ __ ]
I've thrown dogs of bags of dog poop
into my own bin and sometimes they break
due to being pressed against something
else in the bin when that happens you
get dog poo smeared inside your bin that
will stink and has to be washed maybe
I'm just a degenerate I don't think I
would wash that
I think my ass would be like it's trash
a little bit of dog poop in the trash
can what am I worried is going to get
the trash dirty
it's the smell yeah but like
I mean where are you keeping them is it
like if they're if you're cold they're
cold
if you keep it in the garage you'd wash
it why so my car doesn't smell the
garbage cans I don't understand the
problem
it's in your house I don't consider the
garage in my house
like like a yard it's part of my house
it's not in my house though
it's in my house when it has either
carpet or hardwood or or tile
concrete floor is not inside
smell attracts more flies bro you got a
lid you got a lid on the trash can
you're not piping it straight into like
the air intake
this is madness
it's not airtight
it's good enough honestly it doesn't
bother me
I live in the city it smells all the
time
it just smells it's a big of a deal
you go nose blind
I'd be happy with dog poop honestly with
my experience living in the city I'd be
like holy cow
that dog has a great diet that dog is an
all-raw food
fresh refrigerated meat diet good for
them
this is the [ __ ] doesn't look like an
enormous Brown Hawkins cheesy with like
all the water leached out of it it's the
size of my forearm
stop stop you guys are so weird about
poop
people were like yeah but the poop
smells duh
that's why I try to get it out of my ass
into the toilet as soon as possible
I don't want to just stink up my insides
not the [ __ ] personally I couldn't
care less if someone sticks their dog
poop in my trash can that is out by the
road in front of my house I pay the city
to use the city trash can everyone in my
city does it's not mine I think it's a
different story if you walk straight
under the property to dispose of the dog
poop but the way I see it if it's by the
road go ahead and put the dog's poop
there the [ __ ] is like like British laws
in the 1700s
it's like well your honor the trash can
was by the road oh it's but how close
would you say it was past the end of the
driveway or would you say that it was
butting up adjacent to the edge of the
curb of the driveway well does the curb
Belong To The City or does the curb
belong to the homeowner it's like
why don't you just tell me the name of
the movie you wanted to see
I don't think this is like a big deal
that's my two cents
I mean I think everyone even people who
disagree with me on the verdict would
say it's not a big deal it's not like a
capital crime but it's
I think it's nothing Burger that's my
that's my opinion
I think [ __ ] for calling my
girlfriend cheap
it's not necessarily I mean I would
think it is a compliment
but I gotta just listen okay
my GF makes six figures as a pharmacist
and it's still the cheapest person I
know she recently bought a new Toyota
RAV4 and wanted the bars above to mount
her skis no she is not the cheapest
person like she bought a new car and she
skis that's an expensive purchase and an
expensive hobby like that's
him immediately undermines your your
sentiment here to begin with
it's just ridiculous
and that's an SUV they quoted 2K she
decided not to get it even though she
really wanted it she spent about four
months drooling over a handbag that cost
600 bucks she uses a tattered bag from
college and says she needs one but can't
bring herself to buy one I bought it for
her for her Christmas gift and when I
gave it to her she got mad at me for
wasting my money
she did Apologize after saying she loves
it but 600 is too much to spend on a bag
okay it sounds like that's a non-issue
so I'm not even sure why that's involved
she gave you and the easiest Christmas
gift of all time and liked it okay
congratulations why are you turning this
into a problem she never wants to eat
out like at all I usually eat out two to
three times a week but it's hard to get
her to eat out even once a month she
always says she can make the same thing
for cheaper and will only eat out after
some pleading from me she doesn't tip
very high either only 15 usually is this
is bait right
is if you want to get Reddit upset you
just bring up tipping either way 15 is
like the worst number you could bring up
because half of people are like you
should leave zero and half of people are
like 15 what did they spit on your plate
she only drives when there are a few
things to do for example for her to come
over she also drops off mail buys things
goes to the gym on the same trip to save
on gas I'm sure it's eco-friendly you if
this is real you just hate your
girlfriend
like she's just
these are not necessarily like crazy
behaviors
like it's not like she's hanging up her
tea bags on the clothesline to reuse
them or something like that it's like
it's just a fairly reasonable like cost
savings to make without
impacting your quality of life very much
like that's not that crazy
she's just a normal person
she won't ever buy coffee and even
brings her own coffee maker kit rather
than buy coffee for road trips
and she won't buy bread or oat milk she
insists to make it to save money even
though it takes so long she only buys
things on sale blah blah blah she
refused to buy things in Ikea okay now
that's crazy because Ikea is like really
cheap
that's like
one of the cheapest furniture stores you
could go to she's I'm starting to see
his point honestly
not as cheap as other places is pretty
cheap though
it's super expensive it's like super not
though
my bookshelf was like 60 bucks
a piece of garbage like you would never
you would never be like whoa check out
this bookcase you won't believe where I
got it you're like
you know it's more like that's where my
books go but
is pretty cheap
Ikea is expensive is this like a
regional thing
we our last bed not the bed we use now
we bought a bed from Ikea it was a
double bed
it cost two hundred dollars
that's something you literally use for
like a third of your life
it costs half of what like a PS4 cost at
the time
I've seen tables for two thousand
dollars in Ikea yeah you've probably
also seen tables for like 70 bucks and
they'll tell you which one they're
moving more of
foreign
they also have like a dollar 79
breakfast I'm just throwing sorry I'm
not trying to
not trying to say anything socially by
saying this I'm just saying
Ikea prices have gone up 30 thanks to
Lumber Lumber round trip [ __ ]
you think I don't listen to odd Lots
with Joe weisenthal and Tracy Alloway
try serving me so this costs more
because of the lumber the lumber went up
and it came right back down
foreign
because of the lumber good for the tuna
anyway this person is just crazy now I
will say and and like I I've annoyed a
certain subset of people I'm going to
annoy the other subset of people I do
also get annoyed when people treat never
spending money as like that person is
like more moral
[ __ ] drives me crazy because I mean on
the internet at least you know when you
know you got the spotlight on you like I
do sometimes you're like I went out for
a sandwich yesterday and then people are
like go out for a sandwich wow must be
nice to be you know the price you paid
for that sandwich I could have bought uh
two loaves of bread and Boar's Head cold
cuts and cheese and had sandwiches for a
week and then someone else is like oh
bread from the supermarket must be nice
to be in the upper middle class I could
have bought four kilograms of baking
flour and use that to make 17 loaves of
bread at my own house and then stolen a
chicken from a farm and use that to make
an egg every single day and I could have
eaten sandwiches for three weeks like
the idea that spending money is always
immoral
and then like
saving money is always moral I I think
that there's some kind of like
conditioning there that has led Society
down a
uh
what I would consider a a path that is
not necessarily accurate because I deal
with it with my parents like anytime my
parents come out for dinner with us that
my dad will say something like holy cow
like 26 for spaghetti and I'm like just
I know you can make it at home for like
listen they always say crazy stuff too
like I could make it at home just as
good for half the price I'm like no you
can't
you could probably make it pretty good
but there's like eight bucks worth of
butter you'd never do that to yourself
you you care about your cardiac health
you can make good spaghetti you're not
making it this good I'm sorry
they're making the spaghetti 20 times an
hour they know what they're doing okay
I've had your spaghetti I've had their
spaghetti their spaghetti wins out you
can't compete with the pros
there's nobody looks at like uh they
don't get arthroscopic surgery and go
like wow I could probably do this for
450. you know but then the chefs they're
always like they people always look at
it exclusively in terms of ingredient
costs they don't consider it like an art
like if you go to Subway and you're like
I can make this sandwich cheaper you're
like yeah no [ __ ]
it's just like literally all they're
doing is doing what you tell them
of course you got you get it for
convenience but if you go to like a real
restaurant and you're like I could get
this [ __ ] cheaper okay then [ __ ] go
to Le Cordon Bleu Institute of Culinary
education go to the American Culinary
Institute but [ __ ] waste your 20s
going up to going to the restaurant at
7am leaving the restaurant at midnight
smoking 400 cigarettes a day to learn
how to make uh you know a burro block
he's just insulting to say you can make
this cheaper at all anyway all I'm
saying is
it's not immoral to spend money and it's
not moral to save money it depends on
your lifestyle it depends on what your
what you value
anyway that guy's just crazy
I don't know if I could even read this
one
by the [ __ ] for not helping my
girlfriend when she sprained her ankle
throwaway account
me when the API stops responding oh
throw away account not using real names
but my Fred 34 male GF will call her
Maranda 33 female in my opinion
overreacts to pain
she stubs her toe a lot and is always
saying how it hurts she doesn't ask for
help when it happens it just annoys
because you stuff your toe dummy what's
she gonna do
you're gonna fix it you're gonna cast
like a magical spell
it always annoys me because she's clumsy
and could just watch where she's going
anyway we were outside one night I have
this makeshift staff that step that's
pretty flimsy it's a piece of firewood
that's there until I can get something
better
this is a classic like men will actually
live like this and think it's okay post
I got a makeshift step it's just a piece
of firewood or whatever
it's not it's a it's a lawsuit waiting
to happen it's a jigsaw trap it's a
suicide rap you gotta get out of While
We're Young
she okay hold on Miranda used it and
rolled and it caused her ankle to sprain
she fell to the ground and said it
really hurt and it looked like she was
about to cry I told her she'd be fine
even when she crawled past me this is
fake even when she crawled past me to
get inside I did not help because I felt
like she was over exaggerating the pain
well the next day I really looked at it
and I do admit it's bad
she can't put any pressure on it she
told me it was really mean that I didn't
believe her or help her in the moment
and she left to go to her parents house
hasn't been back since saying she needs
time to think now her parents are mad at
me and our friends and also think that
I'm the [ __ ] but I don't see it that
way my sister told me to post here and
see what others would say so Reddit am I
the [ __ ]
you know that John Holmes uh
John Waters not John Holmes a quote
that's like ladies if you go to
a man's house and he doesn't have books
don't burp him
I feel like this is the same thing but
it should be
uh ladies if you go to a man's house and
his front steps are
made of makeshift firewood that's not
even like secured in place
run like you know Samantha Morton at the
near the end of uh Minority Report
hello Daniel hello Daniel only dance and
put it all on Green
hello Daniel Raiders
what do you think dude by the way do you
think you'd be the [ __ ] if your wife
sprained her ankle on your horrendous
homemade front step made of firewood
and then you said oh quit complaining
and she had to crawl past you to get
into the house you think that would make
you the [ __ ] I don't want to be too
controversial I'd say that probably
reflects a little poorly on the man's
character
not the [ __ ] his step his rules
what fair enough
the [ __ ] for telling my sister her
baby name is freaking stupid
hold on let me see the name
just give me a second
the name is Mary that is not that's like
a pretty normal what do you mean it's
[ __ ] stupid
Mary is just like as a normal name maybe
not as common as it used to be
foreign
it would be like like Daenerys or
something but
I'm just look I'm scrolling for the
perfect one to send us
and the [ __ ] for stopping my husband
from traveling
there's been a very pro-wife uh stream
so far
we've had a lot of MIT [ __ ] sections
that were like
women be shopping
today the the men have been in the wrong
like almost exclusively it's a much more
comfortable
place to be as a streamer than being
like well
I get that she's pregnant but at the
same time did she have to call the cops
it's just like I think he's in the wrong
but did she have to call the police
just easier to be like wow this dude's
an idiot LOL thanks for the gifted
subscriptions
and I love it
for context my husband loves to travel
sometimes even does his solo we went
together in some countries and it was
fun being with him doing so but I gotten
pregnant over the pandemic so we sat
down to talk about this because it was
an accident I've always wanted a baby
anyway it's just not this soon and my
husband's reaction was expectedly caught
off guard and had mixed emotions we both
took it as a sign and want to keep the
baby but my husband says he still wants
to travel and asked if I'm okay with it
my parents said they wanted to have a
grandchild anyways and wanted it so bad
they even said they would watch him
while we go out and have fun before I
was even pregnant so I knew my baby
would be in good hands if we still
travel so I said yes we decided to go
through this pregnancy okay I mean
I think it's a bit of a red flag when
you tell your husband you're pregnant
and he says I still want to travel
that's not what you want to hear as like
the first thing to come out of that
discussion I think
also like this is
blue parent posting okay but like it's
naive to think that
oh we can still travel
because my parents can watch the baby
like what are you gonna do
the first year is like [ __ ] up
I'm not saying like that it is good that
there's someone to watch the baby what
I'm trying to say instead is you need to
be there for the baby like literally
you're like nursing or pumping or
bonding or like you know so on and so
forth you can't just be like you know
bye
we're going to Cabo San Lucas you know
like you gotta
you can't really just
put put it with the babysitter like when
you're older or when the baby's older if
your kid's like you know 12
leave the kid with the grandkids over
one month of summer vacation and go go
travel or something they'll be fine
kid with the grand grandparent you know
what I mean
yeah you just got to kind of eat it for
like a few years I feel at least
I know it's less like oh we can't travel
because of the kid it's much more like
oh I don't want to travel because I
would be like a piece of like I don't
think going away now and then makes you
like a bad parent but if you're like oh
I gotta just [ __ ] kids eating into my
travel time and I think it makes you
like a bad parent
you got to be there for your child on
top of uh you know doing the things that
need to be done you need to like build
the the familial Bond
the kid needs you they they don't have
any choice in the matter like you gotta
you gotta make the decision for both of
you
anyway fast forward to now our baby's
eight months old my husband's an
incredible father he hasn't been
anywhere since the baby was born but he
did occasionally talk about where to go
next to travel I honestly thought at
this point he should just stay home and
be a father because he's a parent now he
still shouldn't he shouldn't be gone
even for a day away from our baby I told
him this he got a bit upset he wanted to
think things through and so ask for a
little mental space not to talk about
the subject but then literally the next
day his college friend contacted him and
invited him to a wedding in Taiwan he
told me this and said his friend was the
one who helped him go through a lot in
his college Years and at least give him
four or five days to visit there I still
said no because things changed my
husband explained and said that I broke
the promise I made when I was pregnant
okay
things change brother I'm I actually
think he's in the right but
I don't know if let me know how that
works out for you
he kept telling me to give the baby to
my parents to watch her I said we
wouldn't be responsible parents if we
did that he kept claiming his
responsible is responsible because we
know the baby will be safe but I kept
arguing that it doesn't work that way I
can take him to court if he wants to
abandon the baby he broke his game
system out of anger sorry I need to
scroll he broke his game system out of
anger and has gotten silent afterwards
his only communicated he only
communicated about baby related things
but wouldn't talk to me about anything
else am I am I the [ __ ] bro you
this chick made him break his PS5
are you serious right now
there's a supply chain crunch
no no no don't do me or the PS5 I think
she should just eat this one I'm sorry
to say
I do think it's a little early
like in the first eight months to be
like I would like to leave for five days
that seems kind of crazy to me
but like a four to five day trip
to go to your friend's wedding
that seems fair to me as someone who
just went through
six days of it with a child when the
daycare was closed and also
I had norovirus
like I lived
it's not that big of a deal
I didn't almost die I said I lived
there's two different things
that's what I'm saying I think she kind
of she crossed the line
like he wanted to he's like I'm gonna go
to my friend's wedding for four days she
said no he said I'd really like to she
said I could take you to court for which
I don't even think is true
like no disrespect I'm not trying to
call your bluff and make you feel bad
but if you can't do four days of like
solo baby care I'm not saying it's gonna
be easy if you can't do four days of
solo baby care you're not gonna contact
a lawyer drag this guy to court for for
what
because he went on a vacation for four
days I mean like it's just not
reasonable
that's way more work that's like oh if
you leave me this much work then I'm
gonna do three times as much work as
that over the course so I'm gonna
sustain this Grudge for the 18 months it
takes to get this in front of a judge
like that's just
it's just not unlikely to happen I would
say
he shouldn't break his PS5 I mean that's
like a that's juvenile Behavior but
I think I don't I don't think he's the
[ __ ] I think she's
well I don't know he shouldn't have
broken his console there's kids out
there that would that would love to have
that man well wait was it yeah if it was
like a Wii U then I guess I would allow
it but
like at the same time I can also
understand like your baby's only eight
months old as your first kid
to be like you know I'd like to go to
Taiwan
I feel like if I brought that up to Kate
in May 2021 she would have laughed in my
face and I would have been like just
kidding
unless you're gonna do it do it do it do
it
it's pretty early
in lockdown I don't know [ __ ] are we
still in lockdown I never know these
days
no kind of I don't know
we're fine now
I don't know when we went to San Diego
they were like if you fly from a
Canadian Airport and land in the United
States and you're not fully vaccinated
you have to sign like an affidavit that
says you're gonna uh quarantine for two
weeks which is like first off was not
for me it was for my child who at the
time had only had the one dose that was
offered to them but they need two doses
in order to be considered fully [ __ ]
vaccinated and I was also like excuse me
can you give me President Joe [ __ ]
Biden on the phone he's a dude who would
get a press release that said we beat
covid meanwhile his ass is like oh don't
let in the Canadians hey the Canadians
have to self-isolate if they come to
[ __ ] Florida I know San Diego is in
California I wanted to pick a state that
made my point better I'm sorry
but like [ __ ] look in the mirror
idiot
they're the only domestic covert is okay
all right
we don't want any Canadian covet here
and then it was it was worse because I
was we were like calling the airlines
hey this is Alaska Air and I'd be like
hey so I just read online that according
to the CDC there's like a binding
resolution that if you fly from Canada
into the United States uh we have to
sign an affidavit that we're going to
stay in our uh hotel room for two weeks
to quarantine is that true and then they
would go no we don't have anything like
that and I'd go well according to the
cdc.gov we could go to prison if we make
a false statement under oath and then go
out and get some coffee and they were
like yeah I don't really know about we
don't really care about that anymore we
don't have any restrictions and I was
like okay well thanks for your help
really appreciate it anyway listen
I'm kind of I'm talking I'm putting my
own dirty laundry out there right now
they were basically like you would be
fine
I'm not insulting Alaska Airlines I'm
insulting their staff okay the planes
are immaculate
I love those twin turbo props
planes are innocent
hold on I'm just trying to see
you're the [ __ ] okay there's I mean I
don't know it seems like people are kind
of being rude to her than I would feel
comfortable being she's going through a
lot right now at the same time she did
make him break his PS5
I'm picking on this one because this
post basically says am I the [ __ ] for
hating my wife and but then they're not
the [ __ ] so I gotta know
I gotta know
am I the [ __ ] for following my wife's
request at letting her fail and a
problem bite her in the ass I try and
protect her from harsh realities or
things that will turn out badly
sometimes they're big things sometimes
they're little things slow down you're
going too fast no I'm not I drive here
all the time stop telling me what to do
speed trap speeding ticket in the mail
owned
thank you for your service officer
giving my wife a speeding ticket winning
me the argument don't buy that drink you
won't like it I'ma buy it
grows it's pineapple I hate pineapple
there goes twenty dollars kind of things
she's insistent I let her fail so she
learns a lesson and stop protecting her
from it I do because I love her not to
shelter her keep her in a box she's gets
so upset when she Fails Like emo
teenager curl up in a ball and sulk in
the darkness Vibes and it's really hard
for me to just let it happen and fight
trying to rescue her so these holidays I
let her fail she pays the utilities for
the house she left out a lot of lights
on including the tree Around the Clock I
do what I can to negate it but never
said anything I didn't purposely run
around and burn electricity to prove a
point I just didn't fuss about it when
Lights TV are on in a room and no one
was in all the time I'd simply turn
things off and not say anything
she just got the bill and his
flabbergasted at how expensive it was I
told her I wasn't surprised because of
all the electricity we used in December
now she's mad at me for not being
sympathetic of the bill she has to pay
am I the [ __ ] for letting this happen
and not being sympath though he wrote it
twice okay
tldr my wife pays the utilities
and I and left lights on all the time in
December and got the bill in a surprise
at how much it is and I wasn't being
sympathetic towards her
sorry if it comes across as
condescending it's not my intention the
bill was in exponentially higher it's
just like 80 bucks higher I generally
pay around 80. see this is what it's
like to be a man when you make an am I
the [ __ ] post immediately if the
roles were reversed people would be like
let let him he needs to learn that he's
not mommy's special boy let him suffer
the consequences of his actions I
guarantee the reason he's making this
one is someone probably posted info how
exactly give me a an itemized double
line Ledger breakdown of the bills in
your house because if she's paying the
utilities it sounds like that you're
probably a bad husband and think that
she should pay for everything now he's
got to come in here and justify himself
I gotta pay I pay 85 percent of the
bills she chose what she was able to
afford and handle it she insisted she
help out with the bills utilities are
her responsibility by her choosing I
didn't just assign them to her it's not
a punishment for her behavior it's her
first time paying actual bills besides
her car
there's no parental child Kink here just
a difference in personalities you don't
need to resp you're not
beholden to respond to every insane
person that talks to you
you're the smart enough guy to look at
the message that would suggest that and
just go block like that's
someone asked you you're as the op you
are the satellite dish that collects and
I say this as a streamer
I see more Insanity than you I'm sorry I
know you see crazy stuff on Twitter but
like just by virtue of the fact that
thousands of people interface with this
I become like a conduit for collecting
Insanity now I let some of that Insanity
go out into the signal and it always
feels good at the time and regrettable
later but I'm just [ __ ] absorbing
like 99 of it like ah
uh
and that's my responsibility
when you're the op it's that in a
microcosm people can type anything they
want you don't have to respond to it
just because they asked you could say
hey loser get out of my thread
sometimes you're going to feel the need
because when someone says something
truly crazy that's really easy to refute
it feels great to be like first off
you're crazy secondly it doesn't even
make any sense
so I can understand the temptation to
reply but
regardless
am I crazy for saying who cares is
eighty dollars
like At first I was wondering what uh
like how expensive electricity is
because like our electricity
plus water bill is like the same price
year round
it's like the Heat and the air
conditioning costs the same amount I
guess maybe it's a little cheaper in the
fall a little cheaper in the spring
but it's like it's about 120 bucks a
month
times 12 months
I will say we lived in a [ __ ] in
college
our utility bill was like in a seven
bedroom house it was like a hundred
bucks per month per person in the winter
to heat it probably because the
insulation was put in the house in like
1931 or something like that that she was
leaky as hell the landlords don't care
they're just charging you like 600 bucks
a month rent per room times seven people
for like a house that should probably be
condemned
corn in the walls
right it got me they got me laughing
corn in the walls corn in the walls
called corn in the walls
this just doesn't seem like that big of
a it doesn't seem like that big of a
deal it seems like you hate your your
wife or your girlfriend
does she really talk like that does she
really say I'm a buy it
or is that just something you wanted to
make her appear stupid
to make your point stronger so you wrote
it in all caps imma buy it gross his
pineapple I hate pineapple there goes
twenty dollars what drink was she buying
pineapple juice 20 bucks
shopping at Whole Foods she's like as
dumb as I am
not the [ __ ] she wanted to [ __ ]
around and she found out me when the
electricity bill is 80 higher than it
normally is
[ __ ] around find out well just the most
re overused reaction image of uh 2022
and 2023 so far is the
well the the guy with the white board
hold on we could do it
all right uh it's it's mirrored I can't
me when I'm like uh I haven't eaten in
six hours and I'm hungry a thousand
people replying would [ __ ] around find
out reaction image gif
not not the [ __ ] he [ __ ] around and
found out
not the [ __ ] I don't think that he's
the [ __ ] I'm mostly just like
I don't know I just why are people so
giddy taking pleasure in this also can I
tell you another overused phrase and
normally I'm not hip with the with the
culture
but I respect it
when people say No Cap when people drop
the gritty when people do stuff like
that I say as kids being kids I don't
get annoyed I don't get annoyed at the
younger generation
you know what has been annoying me a lot
people tweeting insane [ __ ] like eating
lunch right now and then
putting hashtag
i-y-k-y-k if you know you know
if I know you're not that interesting
yes I know about lunch do I know about
lunch I don't know eating lunch right
now if you know you know I hate that
[ __ ]
um I'm
getting real busy replying to emails if
you know you know I don't know any what
do you that you're supposed to tell me
that's the first step of social media is
you're supposed to tell me
something and then I react to it it's
not why are we leaving out all these
this breadcrumb Trail
it sounds like you don't know you know
what Jerry
not only do I not know I don't want to
know
you don't want to know
five little monkeys jumping on the bed
one fell off and bonked his head mama
called the doctor the doctor said no
more monkeys jumping on the bed
how do you think the doctor felt when
she called him four more times
we are the worst mother of it
baby's favorite bit
ding ding
can't tell if the wife has the naivete
or competence of a child or if op is
such an infantilized view of her we
can't get an accurate idea of what's
going on yeah okay
fair enough
info why did you marry a woman who
you're treating like a child
oh here we go he's almost 40 and very
educated apparently you're the reason
that the husband Stitch exists you're
the reason that uh heteronormative
primogenitor was the dominant form of
monarchical
inheritance in the Medieval era in
Western Europe bro he was negative 700.
chill out he's literally just a guy okay
he's just like the the one we had
earlier he's just an idiot he's not
responsible for all idiots everywhere
just because he shares a similar mistake
and let me guess she's 23. let me make
up like completely fabricated story
I couldn't find an answer but that's the
scenario I'm picturing that you're
[ __ ] crazy idiot then you're insane
hmm I couldn't find this information
this is information wasn't provided so
I'm just going to assume it was the
worst it could possibly be because how
do you not know how to manage your
utilities after 20 years of living on
your own unless they've raised the rates
on you or you move to a bigger living
space and aren't used to it
it's just like
when people just make mistakes sometimes
sometimes people take a Big Dookie
forget the forget to flush the toilet it
happens
op is very educated and can't help it he
sounds so smart
I mean most of the time I I deal with
this too like a much smaller extent
sometimes I'll be doing something stupid
and then my wife will be like why are
you doing that it's stupid
and then like I would say about half the
time
I go you're right this is dumb and the
other half of the time I'm like offended
that she's right and I'm like even if it
is stupid you should just let me be
stupid and make a mistake
you should just let me get into a car
accident instead so I actually learned
my lesson and then like a minute later
I'm like no you're right it's stupid so
I get it like you know
I get not wanting to be told what to do
all the time when you're an adult
doesn't mean that anyone's wrong in this
situation it just means
it would be annoying annoying outside
and be like I want to drink this
pineapple juice and then someone goes
you don't drink that pineapple juice you
don't like pineapple and then uh
I'm like well you I'm 25 years old you
think I can't even figure out what drink
I want I'm gonna drink it and then I buy
it and go I hate pineapple
